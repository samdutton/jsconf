and so some people aren't always

21
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:12,750
entirely sure what it is that I do but a

22
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:14,220
lot of what I do is going to be

23
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:16,380
explained or evidenced in my talk today

24
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:23,490
um oh there you um the title of my talk

25
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:25,920
is perfectly portable Japanese mobile

26
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:30,780
culture influencing the front end some

27
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:32,490
people might wonder how I arrived at

28
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:36,210
such a topic um well this is an

29
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:38,549
extension of a talk that I gave last

30
00:01:38,549 --> 00:01:41,729
March at up front and in that talk I

31
00:01:41,729 --> 00:01:44,549
discussed Japanese web and front end and

32
00:01:44,549 --> 00:01:46,619
the factors that influence it and what

33
00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:49,619
makes it so Japanese one of the sections

34
00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:52,200
of my talk touched on Japanese mobile

35
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:56,820
phones also called Kate thide n1 and how

36
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:58,409
their growth into staple of Japanese

37
00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:01,409
life in the 90s and Beyond shape the way

38
00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:03,600
that Japanese web sites and the front

39
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,610
end work incepted structured and

40
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:07,110
ultimately how they've changed or

41
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:09,179
haven't changed in response to the way

42
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:12,010
that people use them

43
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:15,879
so today's going to be focusing a little

44
00:02:15,879 --> 00:02:20,079
bit more on mobile phones and this talk

45
00:02:20,079 --> 00:02:21,909
is going to focus on the role of the

46
00:02:21,909 --> 00:02:25,120
mobile phone in Japan both past present

47
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,629
and future Japan's influence on mobile

48
00:02:28,629 --> 00:02:32,560
design and development the current

49
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,170
mobile at culture and web in Japan and

50
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:38,170
the future of Japanese mobile culture as

51
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:41,739
evidenced from the past and also the new

52
00:02:41,739 --> 00:02:43,750
smartphone culture that's cropped up in

53
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:49,150
the last seven years or so so what I'd

54
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:51,220
like to do autumn is to start off by

55
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:53,170
getting an idea of what you all know

56
00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:55,180
about Japan um can I have a show of

57
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:57,579
hands has anyone here actually been to

58
00:02:57,579 --> 00:03:03,760
Japan before okay and so of those of you

59
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,940
who haven't what's your impression of

60
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:09,099
mobile phones in Japan and how they're

61
00:03:09,099 --> 00:03:15,720
used to any volunteers maybe shouts okay

62
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:20,290
anyone else okay so we have some ideas

63
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:24,669
about what it is um but actually it's

64
00:03:24,669 --> 00:03:26,560
not always the way that it seems to be

65
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:29,410
um so here we've got a selection of Kate

66
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:32,290
I denwa Japanese flip phones I chose the

67
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:33,639
flip phone because I'm a little bit

68
00:03:33,639 --> 00:03:36,099
nostalgic for the late 90s and early

69
00:03:36,099 --> 00:03:40,329
2000s when I first went to Japan um and

70
00:03:40,329 --> 00:03:42,190
actually this was one of the first times

71
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:44,019
that I had a mobile phone i went to

72
00:03:44,019 --> 00:03:46,389
japan in 2002 after completing my grad

73
00:03:46,389 --> 00:03:49,090
work and up until that point I hadn't

74
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:51,099
really had a mobile phone before I had

75
00:03:51,099 --> 00:03:52,810
only had one for the last six months I

76
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:55,150
was studying in the US and at that time

77
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:58,659
we had those awful Nokia's that had the

78
00:03:58,659 --> 00:04:01,090
replaceable face plates and they

79
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:02,889
couldn't really do very much except play

80
00:04:02,889 --> 00:04:05,169
one game and they were really difficult

81
00:04:05,169 --> 00:04:08,199
to SMS and there really wasn't much of a

82
00:04:08,199 --> 00:04:10,060
mobile phone culture in the u.s. at that

83
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:13,930
time but when I arrived in Japan I saw

84
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:16,209
mobile phones like this and I saw people

85
00:04:16,209 --> 00:04:18,070
actually doing things with them they

86
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:19,959
were looking at the web they were

87
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:22,240
writing each other a really long email

88
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,550
some people were reading novels on their

89
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:24,960
web

90
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,870
so to me that was completely shocking

91
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:30,150
and immediately I was hooked because

92
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:32,460
this vibrant culture that existed in

93
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:34,530
Japan was unlike anything I'd ever seen

94
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:41,490
before um so to give you an idea of the

95
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:43,319
role of the mobile phone in Japanese

96
00:04:43,319 --> 00:04:45,780
culture and let's start with some

97
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:50,520
numbers um japan has a ninety-five

98
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,949
percent mobile subscription rate that's

99
00:04:52,949 --> 00:04:57,860
about 130 4.8 million subscribers now

100
00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:01,440
that's a lot I mean most countries don't

101
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,940
have that kind of subscription rate at

102
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:07,199
all of these 79.7 percent of the

103
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:09,570
subscribers are mobile Internet users so

104
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:11,550
roughly one hundred and seven point five

105
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:15,630
million that racks up to more than twice

106
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:19,139
the US average for web access on mobiles

107
00:05:19,139 --> 00:05:21,270
this means that Japan is one of the

108
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:22,620
breeding grounds for not only web

109
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:25,050
technology but also for mobile web and

110
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:27,090
this is going to become more and more

111
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:30,900
evident as the talk it's all right um so

112
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:32,610
how did japan get there how did they get

113
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:34,889
such a high market penetration how did

114
00:05:34,889 --> 00:05:36,990
they get people so actively using their

115
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:39,270
mobile phones to access the web well

116
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:40,979
it's all starts with a little bit of

117
00:05:40,979 --> 00:05:44,430
catch up on history on mobile web so

118
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:49,080
let's go back to the 90's and although

119
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:51,389
the first actually commercially offered

120
00:05:51,389 --> 00:05:54,840
mobile web was merged in finland in 1996

121
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:58,680
on the nokia 9000 in the 90 110 series

122
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:01,289
in 1997 which i'm particularly fond of

123
00:06:01,289 --> 00:06:03,150
because it was featured in that awful

124
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:05,849
movie with alkyl over the st. if you

125
00:06:05,849 --> 00:06:08,729
would remember that at all this was

126
00:06:08,729 --> 00:06:10,680
offered by sonara andrade alenia

127
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:13,820
networks and there was kind of

128
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:16,020
accessible to the sense that like it

129
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:17,940
actually existed and people could use it

130
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:19,650
but it wasn't something that was part of

131
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:24,389
everyday life until the mobile web boom

132
00:06:24,389 --> 00:06:27,870
in Japan and that happened around 1999

133
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:30,419
and this happened when NTT DoCoMo which

134
00:06:30,419 --> 00:06:32,940
is one of the big three providers of

135
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:35,760
mobile service in Japan introduced the

136
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,650
first commercially offered browser

137
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:38,430
specific

138
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:42,060
mobile web service called I mode this

139
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:45,090
was a revolution because nobody really

140
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:47,670
had such a broad access to the internet

141
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:49,590
from their mobile phone before it was

142
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:51,750
very much about direct connections to

143
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:53,610
the network but here they were able to

144
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:55,560
package it within a commercial framework

145
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:59,430
it was based on C HTML which was around

146
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:01,920
for a hot minute back then HTML which

147
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,980
was around for a little bit longer and

148
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:06,930
WD ml which was around a little bit

149
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:08,840
later and a little bit longer as well

150
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:12,570
and also proprietary alp and TLP

151
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:15,090
protocols which was a huge jump forward

152
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:16,800
because they were able to provide

153
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,610
customized content um this happened by

154
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:22,920
actually literally pressing an eye mode

155
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:26,700
button so the button had this little

156
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:29,340
logo there and it was a button on the

157
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:31,290
phone itself and you pressed it and you

158
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:33,120
got connected to the web and there was a

159
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,550
little animation that showed like some

160
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:37,440
kind of connection happening as if a

161
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:41,400
virtual coupling had happened and that

162
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,620
was a pretty exciting moment because you

163
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:46,230
were wherever you were on the train you

164
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:48,120
were at school you were walking down the

165
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,250
street sitting in the park and you could

166
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:54,900
actually get some information um the

167
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:56,670
content was controlled by the provider

168
00:07:56,670 --> 00:07:59,130
via the I mode websites so actually in

169
00:07:59,130 --> 00:08:01,230
this case since I mode was provided by

170
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:04,290
ntt docomo NTT DoCoMo was responsible

171
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:06,480
for developing the website that the web

172
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:09,600
phone could access and this allowed for

173
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,730
better provider control over pricing &

174
00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:13,680
billing because it was applied to both

175
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,380
send and receive data packets and here

176
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:18,060
you see that there's a lot of type

177
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:20,670
control over the exchange of data the

178
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:23,100
volume of data control and they had a

179
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:24,780
really tight lid on their networks which

180
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:27,330
is sort of an ongoing theme in Japanese

181
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:30,390
mobile providers and it didn't really

182
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:32,850
loosen up until rather recently and I'll

183
00:08:32,850 --> 00:08:36,480
get to that in a little bit so you had a

184
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:39,660
phone like this you here's the I mode

185
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:42,240
screen you would hit the I mode button

186
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,760
which was often one of the buttons that

187
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:48,570
had an alternate use or sometimes there

188
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:49,770
was a little extra button down here

189
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:50,960
depending on the model

190
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:53,600
you had what's interesting about this

191
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,180
phone is it's a gadda k which is a also

192
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:59,000
a domestic phone so it's a phone that's

193
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,890
produced for domestic use in Japan and

194
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:02,600
I'll explain a little bit more about

195
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,850
them a little bit later as well so they

196
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:06,230
could have all of these extra

197
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:08,300
proprietary buttons that were specific

198
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:11,930
to the carrier's that sold them so you

199
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:14,060
would press the I mode button you'd get

200
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:16,130
connected you'd get to your I mode

201
00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:19,970
screen and then what would happen is is

202
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:22,430
that you would actually encounter a

203
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:24,470
screen that looked like this and this is

204
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:27,830
where you would jump off in later years

205
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:30,020
a lot of these screens were actually

206
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:32,240
partnered up with providers like Yahoo

207
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,550
which is one reason why Yahoo is still a

208
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:36,560
massive massive influence in Japanese

209
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:41,150
web there was often directly a yahoo

210
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:44,060
menu that came down on the Left we have

211
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:49,220
I mode which was ntt docomo um and you

212
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:50,780
can see that there's lots of linking

213
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:53,210
happening you would use the numbers to

214
00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:56,270
navigate down through on the right we

215
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:58,340
have easy web which is the similar

216
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:04,010
system analog for a UK DDI which is

217
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:06,290
another one of the big three providers

218
00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:09,950
the third provider was j phone which

219
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:12,220
then became vodafone which is now

220
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:15,860
softbank and they had something called j

221
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:18,110
sky i happen to have a j phone when i

222
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:19,550
first arrived there it was the most

223
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:21,230
futuristic looking thing I'd ever seen

224
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:23,330
with silver it looked like a tiny

225
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:25,880
spaceship it flipped open it made

226
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:28,040
awesome noises I could play at least

227
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:32,510
five games whoo and um yeah and it was

228
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:35,930
it was a huge revelation for me and for

229
00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:37,640
a long time this was my only way to

230
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:39,980
access the internet and you know what it

231
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:41,480
wasn't just me it was pretty much

232
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:48,860
everybody um so um a lot of providers

233
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:51,260
still followed suit so we had the easy

234
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:55,250
web a UK DD IJ sky IJ phone this put

235
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:57,410
japan in scandinavia at the forefront of

236
00:10:57,410 --> 00:10:59,960
mobile web usage and this was long

237
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,970
before any web ready handsets had become

238
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:03,880
proliferated in the US and europe

239
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:06,340
as I mentioned before and this opened up

240
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:08,290
a whole new system ax tised way for

241
00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:11,170
navigating the web on the go so as I

242
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:13,180
said this was mostly the main way for

243
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:15,060
people to access the web this was before

244
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:17,620
home internet connections were really

245
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:20,530
the norm in Japan most people from the

246
00:11:20,530 --> 00:11:22,900
90s on until a lot of points in the

247
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:26,110
mid-2000s so around 2005 a lot of people

248
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:27,220
i knew still didn't have home internet

249
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:30,010
connections and they would have most of

250
00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:32,200
their internet access either at work or

251
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,000
at school and if they weren't there it

252
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,310
was through their internet phone so that

253
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:39,550
was one of the reasons why japanese

254
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:42,930
mobile web became such a huge influence

255
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:45,400
this means that the market traction for

256
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,830
accessing web via mobile also became the

257
00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:51,250
evolution of japanese web front-end and

258
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:53,650
this was partially them what was

259
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:55,120
actually mostly the point of the first

260
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,790
talk so really Japan was mobile first

261
00:11:57,790 --> 00:12:01,690
before lots of other places so how did

262
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:04,090
we arrive at such an early mobile first

263
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:06,480
approach well this is through people

264
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:11,470
practices and power um wow man and hey

265
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:14,520
thornthwaite in there really fantastic

266
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:16,840
research piece the Internet of everyday

267
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,640
life said it really elegantly when they

268
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:20,710
said the internet is not a system of

269
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:23,590
floating se really above societies it is

270
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:25,240
embedded in the concrete realities of

271
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:29,290
people practices and power and I think

272
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:30,730
that we can all agree that this can be

273
00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:32,560
applied to a lot of what happens on the

274
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:36,390
web and in this case I'm applying it to

275
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:39,850
mobile web access so let's take a look

276
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:42,970
at the people that are creating this

277
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:48,460
pillar of power and practices let's take

278
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:50,800
a look at the people using mobile there

279
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,510
aren't a whole lot of statistics that

280
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:55,570
are really available for the late 90s a

281
00:12:55,570 --> 00:12:57,730
lot of the white papers which were

282
00:12:57,730 --> 00:12:58,960
brought out by the ministry of

283
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,760
telecommunications aren't really that

284
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:03,940
informative about actual statistics

285
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:05,980
about web usage but more about the

286
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:08,560
concepts of its proliferation so the

287
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:11,830
first real hard look from a white paper

288
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:13,839
from the ministry of telecommunications

289
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:15,970
the japan is from about two thousand

290
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:18,370
and back then the average Emma graphic

291
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:21,430
was aged 20 to 29 and it broke down to

292
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:26,100
about 44 744 0.7% man man male the and

293
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:30,670
48.1 % female um fast forward a little

294
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:34,389
bit to 2011 and it's skewed slightly

295
00:13:34,389 --> 00:13:38,170
higher um but then again we have to take

296
00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:40,389
a look at some caveats there I'm sure in

297
00:13:40,389 --> 00:13:42,069
Japan mobile web has always been the

298
00:13:42,069 --> 00:13:43,959
realm of the youth remember that

299
00:13:43,959 --> 00:13:46,019
benchmark year for the mobile web is

300
00:13:46,019 --> 00:13:48,759
1997 so these are early adopters have

301
00:13:48,759 --> 00:13:53,379
grown a little bit older um it's also

302
00:13:53,379 --> 00:13:54,910
skewed younger in some ways if we

303
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:57,670
approach 2015 this is partially because

304
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:00,879
of smartphones but also it's because of

305
00:14:00,879 --> 00:14:02,829
price normalization on mobile plans

306
00:14:02,829 --> 00:14:04,870
mainstreaming of increasingly younger

307
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:06,430
kids having phones to communicate with

308
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:08,620
their parents and the general increasing

309
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:10,329
acceptance of mobile phones as a

310
00:14:10,329 --> 00:14:12,879
necessity of our everyday lives but

311
00:14:12,879 --> 00:14:16,209
that's said it's also skewed older um as

312
00:14:16,209 --> 00:14:18,189
we all know Japan has a decreasing

313
00:14:18,189 --> 00:14:20,319
population and a very highly aging

314
00:14:20,319 --> 00:14:22,449
population and a lot of these

315
00:14:22,449 --> 00:14:24,309
domestically produced phones are

316
00:14:24,309 --> 00:14:26,500
marketed to the elderly with special

317
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,329
features that make them more useful to

318
00:14:28,329 --> 00:14:30,519
them so they're more likely to actually

319
00:14:30,519 --> 00:14:33,040
be able to use the mobile web or to be

320
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,050
interested in trying it because of these

321
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:37,089
phones so in some ways it's also

322
00:14:37,089 --> 00:14:41,379
schooled Oh toad older one of the most

323
00:14:41,379 --> 00:14:43,449
surprising statistics though is that the

324
00:14:43,449 --> 00:14:45,339
fastest growing subset of mobile web

325
00:14:45,339 --> 00:14:48,660
users is aged five years or younger

326
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:53,649
that's a little bit shocking um this

327
00:14:53,649 --> 00:14:55,660
could possibly be because of smartphones

328
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:57,129
it could also be because parents are

329
00:14:57,129 --> 00:15:00,220
seeing the Moors a utilitarian tool and

330
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:02,439
will also come back to this point a

331
00:15:02,439 --> 00:15:05,230
little bit later so it's precisely these

332
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:08,350
ways of using the mobile web which bring

333
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:10,540
us to the next apex in this mobile

334
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:16,389
internet trifecta practices before the

335
00:15:16,389 --> 00:15:18,579
advent of smartphones people were either

336
00:15:18,579 --> 00:15:21,519
using low-end PHS phones or feature

337
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:26,079
phones these got a key so the gada k

338
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:29,470
were domestically produced smartphone of

339
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:31,050
basically produced feature phones

340
00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:33,310
they're called got a cave because gotta

341
00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:35,620
is short for a Galapagos and if we think

342
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:37,690
about Darwin's theory of evolution the

343
00:15:37,690 --> 00:15:39,250
animals of the Galapagos Island had

344
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:40,660
special features that allowed them to

345
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:42,820
survive in their environment and much

346
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:44,710
like these animals in the Galapagos

347
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:48,270
Islands these Galapagos phones ghada k

348
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:51,160
have special features that are extremely

349
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,720
useful to consumers in the japanese

350
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:56,320
market and even today with the huge

351
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,030
cliff eration of smartphones throughout

352
00:15:58,030 --> 00:16:00,430
the world even in japan there's a huge

353
00:16:00,430 --> 00:16:01,990
passion for god okay in these feature

354
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:04,090
phones they still exist they're still

355
00:16:04,090 --> 00:16:06,580
sold maybe the proportion of purchases

356
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:09,100
compared to the overall amount of mobile

357
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:11,260
phone purchases is a little bit smaller

358
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:13,180
but people still have a really nostalgic

359
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:14,980
passion for it which is something that I

360
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:17,770
find really interesting and they're

361
00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:19,420
still accessible they still maintain the

362
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:21,490
networks that people use with those

363
00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:24,340
phones to access the web so who knows

364
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:25,840
then a pinch they might come in really

365
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:29,950
handy still so again let's remember

366
00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:31,870
we're talking about the mid to late 90s

367
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:33,460
when mobile web is really starting to

368
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:35,530
take hold we might still claim to the

369
00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:37,600
image that Japan was the future manifest

370
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,660
and that in mobile web sense it was but

371
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:42,340
not in the way that we might have

372
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:45,040
imagined most people didn't have

373
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,660
internet connections at home like I

374
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:48,880
mentioned before so at the start of the

375
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:52,780
mobile web this was a really big part of

376
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:54,760
their way of accessing information in

377
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:57,360
this new way that was really growing

378
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:02,260
after the debut of I mode in 1999 by may

379
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:03,910
two thousand one more than 40 million

380
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:05,770
Japanese were accessing their internet

381
00:17:05,770 --> 00:17:08,070
via their mobile phones on a daily basis

382
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:11,890
this is opposed to about 4 million North

383
00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:15,310
Americans at the same time in 2001 so

384
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:18,730
there's a huge difference there and

385
00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:20,770
again this is about the time that I went

386
00:17:20,770 --> 00:17:23,200
to Japan so I can really say from my own

387
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,910
personal experience that this difference

388
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:27,640
was massive and it was a bit shocking in

389
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:30,430
hindsight and this number nearly doubled

390
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:31,900
slightly less than two years later

391
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:33,640
according to the Japanese Ministry of

392
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:35,770
telecommunications so things weren't

393
00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:37,270
really slowing down at all people are

394
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:40,120
really grabbing on to this in all of

395
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:42,100
this high level use led to new

396
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:42,790
innovation

397
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:46,870
some of which had a lasting impact so

398
00:17:46,870 --> 00:17:49,840
these are some of the things that people

399
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,640
were using their mobile web for that

400
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,590
have had a lasting impact on how we use

401
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:55,630
our mobile phones today and a lot of

402
00:17:55,630 --> 00:17:57,790
these came out of the ways that people

403
00:17:57,790 --> 00:18:00,150
were either looking to use their phones

404
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:02,980
wanted to use their phones we're

405
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:05,530
naturally adapting their behavior to use

406
00:18:05,530 --> 00:18:07,180
their phones without realizing it um

407
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:10,110
some of these are the male magazine

408
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:12,970
which is really like a newsletter but it

409
00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:14,530
was sent directly to your phone usually

410
00:18:14,530 --> 00:18:18,220
as a multimedia male um it's kind of a

411
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:21,190
proto blog a lot of people were using

412
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:23,950
these as a sort of blogging newsletter

413
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:26,050
but some companies found a marketing

414
00:18:26,050 --> 00:18:28,270
value in this and they would send it to

415
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:30,430
their customers as a way to advertise

416
00:18:30,430 --> 00:18:34,480
their deals or to advertise upcoming

417
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:38,590
marketing campaigns this also is sort of

418
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:40,440
in the realm of micro blogging as well

419
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:43,450
there was a system that was kind of

420
00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:45,370
similar to twitter but really it wasn't

421
00:18:45,370 --> 00:18:47,020
even a formal a system it was a way of

422
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:49,930
sending SMS messages over networks of

423
00:18:49,930 --> 00:18:53,080
multiple receivers so maybe if you had a

424
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:55,390
network of 20 or 25 friends you would

425
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:57,370
just enter in all of their numbers as

426
00:18:57,370 --> 00:19:00,700
the recipients of your message much like

427
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:02,470
what we have now with what's app or

428
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:04,660
telegram with a group message and you

429
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:06,700
could actually include everybody into

430
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:09,310
these things and in a really sort of

431
00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:10,780
primitive way this was a lot like

432
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:15,130
Twitter we also had RFID mobile system

433
00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:18,580
payments so felica or something called

434
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:20,860
oh sigh phuket i sigh foo is the word

435
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:23,380
for wallet so you could actually use

436
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:25,780
your phone to log payments for things

437
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:28,600
that would either be added on to your

438
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,040
mobile phone bill at the end of the

439
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:32,740
month or in later years you were able to

440
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:34,840
have it as a separate deduction out of

441
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:37,990
your bank account this also helps to

442
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:41,410
increase people's attention and

443
00:19:41,410 --> 00:19:44,550
priorities towards mobile web security

444
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:48,340
and eventually this also came to

445
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:50,380
influence smartphone development for web

446
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:53,470
security as well streaming video and

447
00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:56,620
television now we watch you

448
00:19:56,620 --> 00:20:00,190
tube or we listen to music or we have

449
00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:01,809
some type of receiver on our phone where

450
00:20:01,809 --> 00:20:03,970
we can watch movies or what have you we

451
00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:06,550
don't even think about it twice but back

452
00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:08,110
then and I even had one of these phones

453
00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:10,030
you literally had the screen and the

454
00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:12,520
screen would flip up and you could watch

455
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:14,559
TV and it had a little antenna and you

456
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:16,180
could watch your TV just like a normal

457
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:19,770
TV receiver and that was pretty cool um

458
00:20:19,770 --> 00:20:22,840
so a lot of these sort of bridge

459
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:25,690
technologies that sort of bridged what

460
00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:28,030
we had an analog all crossed to mobile

461
00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:31,300
they existed they still exist they're

462
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:33,160
still sort of looked at with a nostalgic

463
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:37,179
I um and they've brought us into a lot

464
00:20:37,179 --> 00:20:38,740
of the technology we have now where we

465
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:41,440
can actually watch videos streaming live

466
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:45,250
on our smartphones my favorite is QR

467
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:49,179
codes we've all used them and they're a

468
00:20:49,179 --> 00:20:51,820
uniquely Japanese invention and I'm

469
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:53,890
going to talk about them in depth I'm in

470
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:56,080
a moment and then finally the mobile

471
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,700
first approach which is really i think

472
00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:00,250
the lasting legacy of the japanese

473
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:02,260
mobile culture and advent of mobile web

474
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:04,000
and these last two points are ones that

475
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,420
i'm going to talk about in depth next so

476
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:10,809
let's take a look at QR codes QR codes

477
00:21:10,809 --> 00:21:12,940
as i said were a uniquely Japanese

478
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:15,309
invention they were developed by Denzil

479
00:21:15,309 --> 00:21:18,610
wave in 1994 and they were originally

480
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:23,050
developed as a way to tag automobiles

481
00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:25,240
during the production process so as they

482
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:27,550
went through the factory they could

483
00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:29,400
track which stage of production each

484
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:32,740
individual automobile was at and the

485
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:33,760
reason why there was such a

486
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:36,690
revolutionary invention was that these

487
00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:40,210
QR codes were so able to have very dense

488
00:21:40,210 --> 00:21:42,309
amounts of data and metadata attached to

489
00:21:42,309 --> 00:21:47,679
them um once they caught up and the in

490
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:49,690
the industry was able to use them as a

491
00:21:49,690 --> 00:21:52,120
regular benchmark people started

492
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:54,990
realizing that they could also use it to

493
00:21:54,990 --> 00:21:57,850
get information across using what we're

494
00:21:57,850 --> 00:22:01,000
now new camera phones so this is also

495
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,510
the late 90s early 2000s so people could

496
00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:07,810
use their camera phones to take pictures

497
00:22:07,810 --> 00:22:09,910
of the QR codes

498
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:11,470
and then you would get something called

499
00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:14,710
mobile tagging so this is where you

500
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:16,870
would actually take a photo of a QR code

501
00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:20,050
off of an actual physical object like a

502
00:22:20,050 --> 00:22:21,970
newspaper or an advertisement a

503
00:22:21,970 --> 00:22:24,970
billboard and take the picture and it

504
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:26,800
would bring you away from the physical

505
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:29,440
world on to the digital world it's also

506
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:32,230
called hard linking and this is a really

507
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:33,550
important thing we may sort of take it

508
00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:35,170
for granted now because it's an action

509
00:22:35,170 --> 00:22:36,820
we do all the time people give us

510
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:39,760
business cards with QR codes we see QR

511
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,680
codes at the bottom of advertisements on

512
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:43,990
flyers for parties we see them

513
00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:46,000
everywhere we're so used to whipping out

514
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,370
our phones snapping a quick picture we

515
00:22:48,370 --> 00:22:50,050
don't think twice about it but back then

516
00:22:50,050 --> 00:22:52,210
this was really one of these actions

517
00:22:52,210 --> 00:22:53,770
that brought us out of the physical

518
00:22:53,770 --> 00:22:55,990
world and into the digital world in a

519
00:22:55,990 --> 00:22:59,370
very real way and I think that the

520
00:22:59,370 --> 00:23:02,800
semiotic sand the iconography the

521
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,990
feeling the archetypes of these kinds of

522
00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:06,940
actions are really really telling about

523
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:09,400
how we've come to relate to the digital

524
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,770
world so this idea of mobile tagging and

525
00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:13,600
hard linking and bridging away from the

526
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,250
physical world into the digital world

527
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:18,190
was a big part of us being able to

528
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:19,990
integrate mobile web into our everyday

529
00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:22,960
lives we use them for everything from

530
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:26,680
vcards to mobile marketing um after

531
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:29,080
their practical industrial purposes were

532
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:31,360
clearly shown people started to realize

533
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,950
that you could use it to get digital

534
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:35,410
business cards to market directly to

535
00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:37,180
different demographics because let's

536
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:39,070
face it everybody was looking at their

537
00:23:39,070 --> 00:23:40,570
phones all the time to get that

538
00:23:40,570 --> 00:23:44,650
information on the web so this began the

539
00:23:44,650 --> 00:23:47,890
very real integration of mobile web into

540
00:23:47,890 --> 00:23:49,840
not only Japanese society of the time

541
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:54,210
but also into our society as a whole um

542
00:23:54,210 --> 00:23:57,040
the next lasting legacy is the mobile

543
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:59,920
first approach this may seem kind of

544
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:02,710
like a no-brainer because we are very

545
00:24:02,710 --> 00:24:06,700
mobile first minded these days but then

546
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:08,320
again we have to really think about

547
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:11,130
where it came from mobile access

548
00:24:11,130 --> 00:24:14,110
outnumbered pc access by a great amount

549
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:16,860
so mobile sites were given priority by

550
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:19,630
projects management teams by companies

551
00:24:19,630 --> 00:24:21,070
who were looking to create their digital

552
00:24:21,070 --> 00:24:23,680
presence so often what would happen

553
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:25,120
is that you would get this really

554
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:29,140
accessible mobile site okay it loves

555
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:32,110
text and blue linking and lots of tiny

556
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:33,940
image mapping but at the time it was

557
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:35,950
extremely accessible but when you went

558
00:24:35,950 --> 00:24:38,830
to their PC site as I called it it was

559
00:24:38,830 --> 00:24:40,840
really kind of a dead zombie site it

560
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:42,520
really didn't give you much information

561
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:45,070
maybe as a consumer there wasn't much

562
00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:46,570
there you could use maybe it was just

563
00:24:46,570 --> 00:24:50,350
their address and some information about

564
00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:52,060
what the company does but it wasn't

565
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:53,530
anything that consumers could use to

566
00:24:53,530 --> 00:24:55,810
actually access their product but when

567
00:24:55,810 --> 00:24:57,670
you looked at the digital counterpart on

568
00:24:57,670 --> 00:25:00,280
mobile there was everything you needed

569
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:02,710
there to find out where to buy it where

570
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:04,660
you could use it how you could use it

571
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:07,690
where you could find support any kinds

572
00:25:07,690 --> 00:25:09,430
of campaigns or deals that might be

573
00:25:09,430 --> 00:25:11,140
coming up for that product so there was

574
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:13,680
a huge gap between this very utilitarian

575
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:17,680
mobile site and this very sort of dead

576
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:21,850
almost perfunctory corporate site on PCs

577
00:25:21,850 --> 00:25:23,970
so you could see definitely that the

578
00:25:23,970 --> 00:25:26,320
priorities lay on the mobile side of

579
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:30,550
things again the bias towards text and

580
00:25:30,550 --> 00:25:32,290
blue linking just simply made it easy

581
00:25:32,290 --> 00:25:34,990
for people to see on their mobile phones

582
00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:37,510
image mapping was also something that

583
00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:39,820
made it easier for people to see but it

584
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:41,560
also turned out that these priorities

585
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:44,230
also sort of started to leak into the pc

586
00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:46,870
design as well so you saw lots of

587
00:25:46,870 --> 00:25:48,700
websites that you were accessing with

588
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:51,640
your pc we're actually looking almost

589
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:53,770
like two mobile sites if they were ones

590
00:25:53,770 --> 00:25:56,160
that had information on them at all

591
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:58,720
there is also the use of the individual

592
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,490
identification number this is another

593
00:26:00,490 --> 00:26:03,610
mobile first not so much in innovation

594
00:26:03,610 --> 00:26:05,590
but the way that they used it in order

595
00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:11,040
to be able to help increase increasing

596
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:14,140
tracking so for example using the iin as

597
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:16,000
a proto cookie from a mobile web access

598
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,890
because remember there was no like

599
00:26:17,890 --> 00:26:20,800
client-side scripting at that point with

600
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,690
those types of phones so they were using

601
00:26:22,690 --> 00:26:25,600
the iin as a way to actually make sort

602
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:28,510
of a marker or tag for which individual

603
00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:30,340
user was using which kinds of services

604
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:33,880
or visiting which kind of sites so QR

605
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:35,530
codes mobile first approach I think are

606
00:26:35,530 --> 00:26:36,909
two of the largest

607
00:26:36,909 --> 00:26:39,009
Agassi's that are left from that era at

608
00:26:39,009 --> 00:26:41,919
the moment and because of that a lot of

609
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:43,840
the industry was able to gain a lot of

610
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:47,649
power so let's look at power and the I

611
00:26:47,649 --> 00:26:50,139
mode business model is the foundation of

612
00:26:50,139 --> 00:26:53,080
which mobile and digital apps marketing

613
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:56,739
is based on as we know it today it's so

614
00:26:56,739 --> 00:26:58,389
much so that Steve Jobs is said to have

615
00:26:58,389 --> 00:26:59,979
based the Apple App Store on the

616
00:26:59,979 --> 00:27:02,320
business model of I mode I find that

617
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:06,489
pretty interesting um there's a lot of

618
00:27:06,489 --> 00:27:08,559
emphasis on development there's a lot of

619
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:12,009
emphasis on developing new ways to

620
00:27:12,009 --> 00:27:14,769
deliver content to people of course and

621
00:27:14,769 --> 00:27:16,239
this set the stage for App Center

622
00:27:16,239 --> 00:27:18,279
technologies that we have now that are

623
00:27:18,279 --> 00:27:21,460
mostly found for smartphones so what

624
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:23,919
does this mean well this means that the

625
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:25,929
mobile web perforated faster than the

626
00:27:25,929 --> 00:27:30,009
home web this means that mobile first

627
00:27:30,009 --> 00:27:33,190
was first in Japan and it also set the

628
00:27:33,190 --> 00:27:34,960
pace and direction for tech and business

629
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:39,869
models later on um so now it's later

630
00:27:39,869 --> 00:27:42,220
what's going on now where does it where

631
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:43,869
is it left to go I think it's a kind of

632
00:27:43,869 --> 00:27:45,909
interesting time for mobile web in Japan

633
00:27:45,909 --> 00:27:48,729
at the moment because there's almost two

634
00:27:48,729 --> 00:27:50,379
different worlds that coexist there's

635
00:27:50,379 --> 00:27:53,049
this really wonderfully nostalgic

636
00:27:53,049 --> 00:27:56,049
culture for gotta k and all of these

637
00:27:56,049 --> 00:27:57,759
feature phones that are still being

638
00:27:57,759 --> 00:27:59,979
produced and still being designed some

639
00:27:59,979 --> 00:28:02,229
just for designs sake some for novelty

640
00:28:02,229 --> 00:28:04,809
snake some for nostalgia sake but a lot

641
00:28:04,809 --> 00:28:06,849
of them are also still very much serving

642
00:28:06,849 --> 00:28:09,820
a real function for example phones made

643
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:12,129
for the elderly or phones made for small

644
00:28:12,129 --> 00:28:13,629
children where parents don't want their

645
00:28:13,629 --> 00:28:16,419
children to have too much access to the

646
00:28:16,419 --> 00:28:18,340
web for example which is a problem with

647
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:22,029
smartphones um so I think that these

648
00:28:22,029 --> 00:28:24,249
will continue to exist and I think

649
00:28:24,249 --> 00:28:26,049
they'll continue to serve a purpose it

650
00:28:26,049 --> 00:28:28,629
in fact for example a lot of times

651
00:28:28,629 --> 00:28:30,669
during disasters like earthquakes these

652
00:28:30,669 --> 00:28:31,989
feature phones can sometimes be a

653
00:28:31,989 --> 00:28:34,149
lifesaver so a lot of people that I know

654
00:28:34,149 --> 00:28:35,919
still have both their smartphone and

655
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:38,049
their feature phone it's a backup and I

656
00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:40,769
don't think that's a bad idea at all um

657
00:28:40,769 --> 00:28:43,419
and of course people in Japan are using

658
00:28:43,419 --> 00:28:44,559
smartphones for all the things we're

659
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:47,289
using them now social networking chat

660
00:28:47,289 --> 00:28:50,109
games shopping surfing but now it's

661
00:28:50,109 --> 00:28:50,710
mostly on

662
00:28:50,710 --> 00:28:53,710
our phones I say mostly because people

663
00:28:53,710 --> 00:28:55,480
are still using these got okay but then

664
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:57,309
again I don't think those are going to

665
00:28:57,309 --> 00:29:00,370
go away and i think that the advent of

666
00:29:00,370 --> 00:29:02,710
smartphones is tipped power but not a

667
00:29:02,710 --> 00:29:08,620
whole lot um i think that what's going

668
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:10,120
to happen is that there's going to be a

669
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:13,440
bit of a flattening of the whole culture

670
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:16,179
smartphones are more or less similar I

671
00:29:16,179 --> 00:29:17,740
mean we have different features we have

672
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:19,210
different models what have you but

673
00:29:19,210 --> 00:29:20,950
they're all based on very app centric

674
00:29:20,950 --> 00:29:23,799
technology whereas feature phones aren't

675
00:29:23,799 --> 00:29:26,799
they're very individual there each model

676
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:28,360
is extremely different from the last

677
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:31,020
each provider has a different array of

678
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:34,299
ranges of handsets available so I think

679
00:29:34,299 --> 00:29:35,830
there's a diversity that's available

680
00:29:35,830 --> 00:29:38,230
with these feature phones doesn't really

681
00:29:38,230 --> 00:29:40,179
play out in the same way in the

682
00:29:40,179 --> 00:29:43,960
smartphone field um so I think that

683
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:46,000
there's probably gonna be a muting of

684
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,649
the market but I also think that there's

685
00:29:47,649 --> 00:29:50,169
still potential for a lot of interesting

686
00:29:50,169 --> 00:29:55,760
maybe more artistic Oh interesting or

687
00:29:55,770 --> 00:29:59,770
interesting or artistic ways to design

688
00:29:59,770 --> 00:30:03,610
these feature phones um one thing I want

689
00:30:03,610 --> 00:30:05,500
to point out is the statistic I want to

690
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:06,940
come back to from before that the

691
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:08,620
fastest-growing subset of mobile web

692
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:13,450
users is age 5 or younger this is also a

693
00:30:13,450 --> 00:30:16,360
function of smartphones a lot of parents

694
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:18,250
are using them as educational tools for

695
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:20,110
their children they're very image based

696
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:22,029
children are able to touch the screens

697
00:30:22,029 --> 00:30:23,559
and be tactile with them which is very

698
00:30:23,559 --> 00:30:27,460
important so I'm it maybe it's a bit of

699
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:30,580
a skewed statistic because of the way

700
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:32,919
that people use their smartphones and I

701
00:30:32,919 --> 00:30:34,929
think that in that sense that's where

702
00:30:34,929 --> 00:30:36,970
that generation is going to miss out on

703
00:30:36,970 --> 00:30:38,740
some of the advantages of having these

704
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:43,659
feature phones um in that sense

705
00:30:43,659 --> 00:30:44,950
smartphones were kind of slow to

706
00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:47,500
penetrate in Japan and this is an

707
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:49,120
interesting case I wanted to focus on a

708
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:53,140
little bit with iphone vs android the

709
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:55,120
fun fact about this is that iphone was a

710
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:57,490
bit slow to catch on in japan because

711
00:30:57,490 --> 00:30:58,929
there wasn't really much of a carrier

712
00:30:58,929 --> 00:31:01,480
choice it wasn't available in japan

713
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:04,179
until mid-2008 and Softbank

714
00:31:04,179 --> 00:31:06,779
which was Vodafone which was Jay phone

715
00:31:06,779 --> 00:31:09,519
had a three-year monopoly on iPhone and

716
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:12,279
iPad retail and contracts before number

717
00:31:12,279 --> 00:31:14,379
portability became an option in late two

718
00:31:14,379 --> 00:31:16,149
thousand eleven people were really

719
00:31:16,149 --> 00:31:17,619
reluctant to change their carriers

720
00:31:17,619 --> 00:31:18,909
because if they changed their carriers

721
00:31:18,909 --> 00:31:20,499
they lost their phone number so people

722
00:31:20,499 --> 00:31:22,749
were very loyal to their carriers and I

723
00:31:22,749 --> 00:31:25,059
think this also has another factor in

724
00:31:25,059 --> 00:31:27,129
the sense of all of these feature phones

725
00:31:27,129 --> 00:31:28,809
and how people would stick with the same

726
00:31:28,809 --> 00:31:31,179
carrier and choose their future phones

727
00:31:31,179 --> 00:31:34,809
but in fact since number portability is

728
00:31:34,809 --> 00:31:37,570
come about Japan is the only market

729
00:31:37,570 --> 00:31:39,850
where Android has actually had a gain of

730
00:31:39,850 --> 00:31:41,799
nearly eight percentage points in the

731
00:31:41,799 --> 00:31:44,559
last two years and this is from a survey

732
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:46,749
done by the Kantar Worldpanel and I

733
00:31:46,749 --> 00:31:48,190
think that's quite interesting as well

734
00:31:48,190 --> 00:31:51,100
because um this shows again a bit of a

735
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:53,980
tipping into a diversity of app related

736
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:55,869
technologies for smartphones that wasn't

737
00:31:55,869 --> 00:31:57,820
necessarily there before so it could be

738
00:31:57,820 --> 00:32:02,769
interesting to see where that goes um so

739
00:32:02,769 --> 00:32:05,309
what are the takeaways about this well

740
00:32:05,309 --> 00:32:08,289
early mobile web adoption set the

741
00:32:08,289 --> 00:32:10,659
priorities for how mobile web was

742
00:32:10,659 --> 00:32:13,149
developed our mobile first approach and

743
00:32:13,149 --> 00:32:16,350
how a mobile and non mobile web

744
00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:20,590
interacted with each other um I drove

745
00:32:20,590 --> 00:32:23,110
the use of innovations like blogs RFID

746
00:32:23,110 --> 00:32:25,029
payment systems lay the groundwork for

747
00:32:25,029 --> 00:32:27,159
streaming video and TV and QR codes and

748
00:32:27,159 --> 00:32:31,090
more and smartphone proliferation is

749
00:32:31,090 --> 00:32:32,710
muted the market so maybe

750
00:32:32,710 --> 00:32:34,779
compartmentalization is going to give us

751
00:32:34,779 --> 00:32:37,240
a bit of imagine a but improving the

752
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:39,129
existing issues in web design as it

753
00:32:39,129 --> 00:32:40,690
affects desktop oriented sites as

754
00:32:40,690 --> 00:32:41,919
something that's also gotten better

755
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:44,619
there's been more emphasis on

756
00:32:44,619 --> 00:32:46,240
integration of the two approaches a

757
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:48,490
smartphone-based client-side scripting

758
00:32:48,490 --> 00:32:51,519
use happens so we'll see that maybe that

759
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:55,210
gap between the more feature phone style

760
00:32:55,210 --> 00:32:57,460
websites which is still very much a part

761
00:32:57,460 --> 00:32:59,249
of Japanese front end today and

762
00:32:59,249 --> 00:33:02,320
smartphone style apt driven very flat

763
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:04,749
design sites will start to close a

764
00:33:04,749 --> 00:33:07,240
little bit more and I also hope this

765
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:08,710
means that will slowly see an end to

766
00:33:08,710 --> 00:33:10,690
these zombie sites these sites where

767
00:33:10,690 --> 00:33:11,980
it's just sort of a perfunctory

768
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:14,980
corporate site for a particular company

769
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:17,109
and that will actually move towards more

770
00:33:17,109 --> 00:33:18,010
of the Western

771
00:33:18,010 --> 00:33:21,310
style diversity of different web sites

772
00:33:21,310 --> 00:33:22,870
and many sites that are available to

773
00:33:22,870 --> 00:33:25,090
educate the consumer about products or

774
00:33:25,090 --> 00:33:28,300
services and so yeah I think that's

775
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:30,180
where the future's going to take us um

776
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:34,210
oh I want to say thank you to everybody

777
00:33:34,210 --> 00:33:36,700
who came today and there's a list of

778
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:40,870
people here i want to thank um yeah and

779
00:33:40,870 --> 00:33:43,120
i hope that you can see the legacy of

780
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:48,640
japanese web mobile um used when you

781
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,140
look at your smartphone when you use

782
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:51,880
your apps and that maybe hopefully

783
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:53,380
someday you'll work on a project that

784
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:54,910
helps to bridge this gap a little bit

785
00:33:54,910 --> 00:34:04,330
more thank you
