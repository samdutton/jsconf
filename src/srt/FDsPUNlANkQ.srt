1
00:00:15,439 --> 00:00:17,849

thank you very much for having me here

2
00:00:17,849 --> 00:00:21,480
and I hope people are not yet sleepy so

3
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,579
just to make sure we'll do another

4
00:00:23,579 --> 00:00:27,000
exercise can I have everyone raising

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,070
your left hands and now both hands and

6
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:33,570
stay there for a second i promised my

7
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:43,500
mom awesome thank you guys so thanks so

8
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:46,010
much for having me here it's amazing

9
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:49,340
Iceland Reykjavik it's beautiful and

10
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:52,560
it's also quite awesome to be surrounded

11
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:55,710
by so many JavaScript enthusiasts eager

12
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:59,460
to learn and share their experiences for

13
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:01,800
the next half an hour hopefully less

14
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:04,589
I'll be quick to not keep you longer

15
00:01:04,589 --> 00:01:06,689
here I'll be talking to you about the

16
00:01:06,689 --> 00:01:09,299
topic I'm very passionate about speech

17
00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:12,479
recognition and most excitingly of all

18
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:15,240
I'll show you how you can empower web

19
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:18,479
applications with voice triggered

20
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:22,950
interactions first off let me just tell

21
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:29,430
you a bit about myself one second so I

22
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:32,250
work for sports technology company

23
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:36,570
called huddle which builds analytics

24
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:40,290
tools for Cote coaches and athletes at

25
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:53,190
all level to help them win and second

26
00:01:53,200 --> 00:02:08,340
have a technical difficulty here

27
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:11,110
just my spit always happens speaker

28
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:19,660
notes going on so going back I want to

29
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:23,860
tell you a short story so I've been

30
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:25,720
playing around with speech recognition

31
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:28,090
for about four years when I was studying

32
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:31,090
it for my master's degree and I was

33
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:34,780
quite intrigued by how hard of a problem

34
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:38,050
this is just imagine all the various

35
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:42,180
factors like accent pronunciation

36
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:45,250
articulation roughness masala tea pitch

37
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:48,760
volume and speed that influences how it

38
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:55,810
performs in practice speech looks a lot

39
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:59,220
like this it's continuous sound wave

40
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:02,080
whose amplitude varies based on the

41
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,990
sounds involve the speech recognition

42
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:08,530
process typically goes through the

43
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:10,480
following steps first is pleased the

44
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,870
sound wave by silences into what are

45
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:17,020
called utterances it's basically words

46
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:20,980
or other non linguistic sounds then each

47
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:23,940
utterance is split split in frames and

48
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:27,580
for each frame we have something that's

49
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:30,130
called a feature vector which is

50
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:32,440
basically a sort of number representing

51
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:35,710
distinguishable properties of that sound

52
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:39,910
and once we have all these things we

53
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:42,700
employ a classifier that takes a series

54
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:46,450
of models to identify and do the

55
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:48,790
matching process based on them those

56
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:51,430
properties and figure out what the

57
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:55,950
speech is about so just a quick brief

58
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:59,350
overview have an acoustic model that

59
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:02,860
contains coup stick properties for

60
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:05,170
distinct units of sound a phonetic

61
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:07,900
dictionary with maps the words to their

62
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:10,300
respective phonemes as they're called

63
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:12,730
these units of sounds that constitute

64
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:15,340
words and the language model that allows

65
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:20,799
to make the search space easier based on

66
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:22,170
already recognized where

67
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:25,950
to be able to find the relevant ones

68
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:30,330
based on probability quicker and the

69
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:32,630
speech if you wonder it is actually

70
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:36,390
hello world just in case you're

71
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:40,020
wondering in practice speech recognizers

72
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:43,100
are assessed based on two things

73
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:48,210
accuracy and speed for accuracy it's the

74
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:52,200
word error rate which looks at the ratio

75
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:55,050
between the insertions substitutions and

76
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:57,540
deletions over the total number of words

77
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:59,820
in the reference feet and you can see

78
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:01,350
quickly in an example there what that

79
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:05,160
means and speed is the real time factor

80
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:08,180
the decoding time over the speech time

81
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:11,010
so now just to make sure I didn't lose

82
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:12,960
you can we do that exercise again so

83
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,360
everyone left hand quickly right hand

84
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:21,270
and wait a bit awesome perfect so let's

85
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:23,850
see some use cases so probably a lot of

86
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:25,680
you are familiar and you might already

87
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,110
use personal assistant apps like Siri

88
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:32,820
and in practice speech recognition

89
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:36,270
engines like the one that powers empower

90
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:41,400
Siri are of two types the ones that are

91
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,650
speaker independent so basically

92
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:45,330
regardless of the speaker so all the

93
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:47,160
things like pronunciation accent they

94
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,510
don't matter they're supposed to

95
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:50,700
recognize their speech and speaker

96
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:54,300
dependent which basically it involves an

97
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:56,790
extra training step for a particular

98
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:59,310
speaker where they need to read some

99
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:01,860
predefined template sentences to

100
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:03,930
fine-tune the recognition process and

101
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:08,730
increase the accuracy and just to

102
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:12,980
continue on with my story earlier

103
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:15,660
towards the end of my studies I had a

104
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:18,060
great opportunity to put in practice

105
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:19,740
what I learned about speech recognition

106
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:25,050
in the research team at Mozilla and the

107
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:26,460
project was to build a speech

108
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:30,210
recognition engine for Firefox OS and

109
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:31,350
for those of you who are not familiar

110
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:33,900
with Firefox OS does the mobile

111
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,280
operating system at

112
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,920
missoula built and they're heavily

113
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:40,350
developing it that's based on web

114
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:43,860
technologies so being a research project

115
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:46,350
for focus was more on exploring what's

116
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:47,700
even possible in terms of speech

117
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:49,650
recognition on the web mainly using

118
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:52,290
javascript rather than having something

119
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:56,100
solid solid production ready so during

120
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:58,110
my time there I've built a pure

121
00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:00,330
JavaScript speech recognizer that

122
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:03,450
performs the speech recognition process

123
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:07,050
on the client without the need of any

124
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:09,360
cloud-based solution that where you just

125
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,280
send the speech and it you get the

126
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:15,030
results back and I would show you a

127
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:20,669
quick demo of that feel free to ignore

128
00:07:20,669 --> 00:07:22,830
all the details there they're not very

129
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:25,740
relevant for the scope of this talk so

130
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:29,270
the idea is I'll show you an example for

131
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:33,540
recognizing digits which is made

132
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:36,720
possible given four digits the models

133
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,350
the language model phonetic dictionary

134
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:42,060
and acoustic model are quite small and

135
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:45,419
can be easily loaded on the client so

136
00:07:45,419 --> 00:07:53,000
let's try out some numbers three two one

137
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,710
here you go and as you can see in the

138
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:58,800
console it basically shows you the

139
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,979
result it also shows it on the page and

140
00:08:00,979 --> 00:08:04,080
some performance I was talking about

141
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,960
real time factor here you can see 0.0 82

142
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,450
basically a real factor of 1 means the

143
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:11,520
decoding happens in real time it takes

144
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,080
the same time as it took for the speech

145
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:17,250
and for this example you also see three

146
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:21,360
different solutions which are one

147
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,039
different than the other that's

148
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:25,530
basically in the process of recognizing

149
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:29,370
speech it takes different probabilities

150
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:31,140
and you see some various kors there

151
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:33,030
which might not make much sense but it

152
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:36,210
ranks the possible outcomes and in this

153
00:08:36,210 --> 00:08:38,250
case as I chose here the what's called

154
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:40,890
an best hypothesis I chose free so I got

155
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:44,830
the top free awesome

156
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:50,530
going back to the this project that I

157
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,360
built if you are interested to know how

158
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:55,540
it works and all these kind of details

159
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:58,510
feel free to fly me after the stock or

160
00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:02,020
ping me on Twitter or the J's comp slack

161
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:07,750
and little did I know around the same

162
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:11,590
time I was researching this and building

163
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:14,230
that speech recognizer at Mozilla a team

164
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:17,500
for from google were writing up a spec

165
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:22,020
for what they call the web speech API is

166
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:24,430
basically defining JavaScript API is

167
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:26,250
that would allow developers to

168
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:29,530
incorporate speech recognition into

169
00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:33,160
their web pages and about a year later

170
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:37,780
in 2013 these were supported

171
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:42,720
experimentally in chrome version 25 and

172
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,880
these were building up on top of a

173
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:48,340
feature that chrome released from

174
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:52,120
version 11 which was to have speech

175
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:54,970
input with this attribute called X

176
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:58,780
WebKit speech for input fields to allow

177
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:04,990
to users to use the voice to input data

178
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:11,080
into forms and now let's see how these

179
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:14,650
api is looking practice you first need

180
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:16,750
to instantiate the speech recognition

181
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:20,230
object and since the api's are still

182
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:23,740
experimental they do need a browser

183
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:29,310
prefix for chrome not for firefox though

184
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:32,860
some of the most relevant configuration

185
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:35,500
attributes for speech recognition are

186
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:38,620
the language one which allows you to set

187
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:42,780
the language that will be recognized and

188
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:46,230
chrome google supports 32 of them

189
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:50,350
including icelandic as i found out an

190
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:52,330
attribute that allows you to specify if

191
00:10:52,330 --> 00:10:56,920
you are interested in interim results so

192
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,300
as the speech

193
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:07,740
goes on you get results up might liver

194
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:11,080
also the continuous if the speech should

195
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:14,700
be listening continuously and finally

196
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:18,310
the max alternatives which is something

197
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:19,990
similar to what I showed you with the

198
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:26,260
end best hypothesis and there are a few

199
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:28,060
event handlers provided for the speech

200
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:30,010
recognition in their face and I would

201
00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:31,930
recommend you check the full API at that

202
00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:34,720
link there however the minimum needed to

203
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,820
get you started our own result which

204
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:38,500
gets called whenever you have a speech

205
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:41,890
recognition result on no match when no

206
00:11:41,890 --> 00:11:43,390
match was found for the current speech

207
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:50,620
and one error when an error look for in

208
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:53,590
terms of controlling the recognizer have

209
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:57,010
a pretty self-explanatory API start and

210
00:11:57,010 --> 00:12:02,800
stop and before we wrap things up I just

211
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,810
want to show you how the speech

212
00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:13,060
recognition result format looks like so

213
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:16,920
this is basically the event that comes

214
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:21,940
into the own result event handler and it

215
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:25,510
has a few properties is final which says

216
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:27,700
if does the final result that the

217
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:30,400
recognizer has the high confidence about

218
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:34,090
the index in the result so that the

219
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:36,910
speech has multiple results and then an

220
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:39,210
array of speech recognition results

221
00:12:39,210 --> 00:12:43,150
which contain again various properties

222
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:46,720
but the one you're interested in is the

223
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,060
transcript which tells you what it

224
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:50,560
actually recognized those who has one

225
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,720
that says the confidence which gives you

226
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:57,240
confidence score so this seems quite

227
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:03,720
straightforward and did anyone notice

228
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:07,780
anything and I guess you probably

229
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:13,670
already see as a spoiler on the

230
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:17,680
for the past few slides I was actually

231
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:20,350
not clicking anything to switch between

232
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:26,890
them i was using speech recognition to

233
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:31,360
talk about speech recognition and let me

234
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,160
just reset this so that you see it

235
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:46,660
happening live so as i was saying come

236
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:52,180
on you can do it as I was saying I was

237
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:57,640
using speech recognition to talk about

238
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:02,380
speech recognition and how meta is that

239
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:06,160
right it's quite cool and you can see as

240
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:12,190
a type well it likes to make jokes as I

241
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:20,130
talk as well so the grayed out text is

242
00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:22,870
what I was mentioning earlier the

243
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:27,520
interim results and now we detected a

244
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:29,880
keyword and it decided to go crazy on me

245
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:34,030
so the grayed out text was the interim

246
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:41,290
results and start out again perfect here

247
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:45,370
you go and when it becomes wide that

248
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:50,320
becomes the final result exactly you

249
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:58,350
know it best so you might be wondering

250
00:14:58,350 --> 00:15:01,650
can I use this now is where is it behind

251
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:06,100
those like crazy browser flags and that

252
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:09,430
no user will know how to turn on when

253
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:15,560
they're using your application and

254
00:15:15,570 --> 00:15:19,750
unfortunately the support is not that

255
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:23,020
great it's only chrome and opera that's

256
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:25,390
poured it out of the box

257
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:29,500
and Firefox with the special web speech

258
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:33,610
recognition flag and as far as I know

259
00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:36,190
Microsoft is working on adding support

260
00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:41,290
for that and that might be unfortunate

261
00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:45,100
but as we all know with web api's takes

262
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:47,500
a while until they become the norm and

263
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:51,880
all the browsers implement them and on

264
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:55,570
that note I hope you will use this

265
00:15:55,570 --> 00:15:59,800
knowledge to build very exciting apps so
