[Music]

2
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:22,580
I've been working with The Wall Street

3
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:24,050
Journal to develop their mobile website

4
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:26,770
for about the last 18 months or so and

5
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:32,750
it's difficult to develop for mobile can

6
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:34,820
I get a show of hands of people in here

7
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:38,410
who have developed for mobile devices

8
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:42,230
okay and raise your hands if you were

9
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:44,440
satisfied with how that experience went

10
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:50,870
all right one guy cool yeah

11
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:53,270
mobile development is still in its

12
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:58,700
infancy and still requires a pretty

13
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:01,160
solid understanding of this new

14
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:04,699
philosophy that underlies what these

15
00:01:04,699 --> 00:01:07,369
devices do virtually all of us are

16
00:01:07,369 --> 00:01:09,440
coming at mobile development from a

17
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:11,960
desktop background and we try to

18
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:14,899
approach mobile sites the same way that

19
00:01:14,899 --> 00:01:17,180
we approach desktop sites and it's not

20
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:22,160
going to work so everybody knows what

21
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:24,439
this thing is I hope it's the meta

22
00:01:24,439 --> 00:01:26,540
viewport tag and you can't have a mobile

23
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:30,130
optimized site without it and this is

24
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:33,049
what any tutorial that you look up in

25
00:01:33,049 --> 00:01:35,479
Google is going to tell you to put they

26
00:01:35,479 --> 00:01:38,119
don't really tell you exactly what it's

27
00:01:38,119 --> 00:01:40,220
doing or why you need it they just tell

28
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:42,200
you that you need it and it's a little

29
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:44,240
more complicated than that because this

30
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:47,439
thing is powerful but it can also

31
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:50,000
configure your sites in weird ways and

32
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,560
it has so many exceptions that you will

33
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,600
have to wrestle with before it is able

34
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:58,490
to do its job so before we can talk

35
00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:01,400
about width equals device width we have

36
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,439
to talk about what width means in a

37
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:06,649
mobile context when we started out on

38
00:02:06,649 --> 00:02:10,910
the desktop we knew in the early days of

39
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:15,320
desktop development that we didn't know

40
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:18,079
exactly what screen resolution we were

41
00:02:18,079 --> 00:02:19,940
going to be dealing with on you know the

42
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:22,220
user's machine we didn't know how wide

43
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:23,959
their browser was going to be on that

44
00:02:23,959 --> 00:02:26,870
computer but the one thing we could

45
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:29,930
trust at the very least was that a pixel

46
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:32,120
on their screen was the same thing as a

47
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,710
pixel in their browser

48
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:35,390
was the same thing as a pixel in your

49
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:38,660
72dpi PSD which is the same thing as one

50
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:43,580
CSS pixel which is great and then this

51
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:46,130
came along and you had Retina displays

52
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:48,440
and you had pinch-to-zoom and that all

53
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:51,350
went out the window and to make things

54
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:55,340
worse you can't really get back to what

55
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:57,140
we had the simplicity of one pixel

56
00:02:57,140 --> 00:03:01,030
equals one pixel instead you have to

57
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:03,980
free yourself from the concept of what a

58
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:09,710
pixel even means the viewport is a new

59
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:11,570
concept desktop browsers don't really

60
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:13,760
have a viewport unless you consider the

61
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,350
browser window itself to be a viewport

62
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:17,630
but I'm going to argue that especially

63
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:19,700
in the mobile context they are really

64
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,050
not the same thing

65
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:23,060
it's best to think of the viewport as a

66
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:26,150
hole that you are viewing your real

67
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:29,840
website through and that hole is

68
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,240
stretchable or maybe you can think of

69
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:34,220
the hole as getting closer or farther

70
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:37,190
away from the site but the viewport

71
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:39,260
despite what the user may think because

72
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:41,720
the user sees the viewport and thinks of

73
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,880
it as the browser window but the

74
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,290
viewport is not the browser window it's

75
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:46,520
a hole that you're looking at the

76
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,980
browser window through and that means

77
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:50,720
that when you make the viewport smaller

78
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,790
or bigger it's not the same thing as

79
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:54,380
making your browser window smaller or

80
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:56,870
bigger because on a fluid layout when

81
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:58,400
you make the browser bigger or smaller

82
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,550
the site moves up and down with it but

83
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:02,750
when you zoom in and out of your

84
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:07,490
viewport that doesn't happen so Apple

85
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:08,960
introduced Retina displays with the

86
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:12,020
iPhone 4 and they said look obviously we

87
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:14,390
don't want all of the mobile optimized

88
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:15,860
sites that have already been built to be

89
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:18,049
1/4 of the size on this new phone that

90
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:20,840
we've built so for the sake of this

91
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:23,600
phone four of the pixels on the screen

92
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,420
of this phone constitute one virtual

93
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:30,170
pixel or CSS pixel if you like but then

94
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:32,300
the ability to zoom the viewport beyond

95
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:34,730
that means that even that virtual pixel

96
00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:36,830
is a fairly imprecise unit of

97
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:42,919
measurement so these are things that are

98
00:04:42,919 --> 00:04:44,240
not going to help you if you're

99
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,940
developing a mobile site you can no

100
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:47,600
longer count

101
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,820
on these things being the same how many

102
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:52,340
pixels wide your site is what about the

103
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:56,090
screen what about your stylesheet they

104
00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:57,560
could all be different the site could

105
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:00,020
display properly they could all be the

106
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:03,460
same in the site could display wrong and

107
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:09,140
there's a bunch of exceptions so there's

108
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:10,700
an invisible browser on the other side

109
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:12,800
of that hole it has no chrome but it's

110
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,550
there as you know with any regular

111
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:19,460
browser desktop browser when you squeeze

112
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:22,340
the browser all the way down two things

113
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:24,560
will happen one if it's a really liquid

114
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,080
layout it will actually reflow all the

115
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,940
way down as tight as you squeeze it but

116
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:30,890
more likely that website has a

117
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:33,440
hard-coded width set on it in which case

118
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,720
squeezing the browser window down is not

119
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,790
going to do anything but pop up a scroll

120
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:41,840
bar at the bottom or the layout could be

121
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,640
a fairly liquid layout but there could

122
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:47,060
be a picture or some element in there

123
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:48,710
that's fairly big and sooner or later

124
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:50,870
that is going to be the smallest that

125
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:53,330
that website is going to go so if you if

126
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:54,800
you want your website's to go all the

127
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,860
way down to 320 pixels you're gonna have

128
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:59,450
to make sure that there are no

129
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:01,550
hard-coded widths on your site and that

130
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:03,440
there are no elements in there that at

131
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,420
least in a mobile context are larger

132
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:08,450
than the invisible browser behind the

133
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:09,410
hole that you're trying to squeeze

134
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:11,390
things down that's what the width part

135
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:13,370
does it's talking about not the width of

136
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:14,750
the viewport which is just a piece of

137
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:16,790
glass but the width of the invisible

138
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:18,740
browser behind the viewport but what is

139
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:22,340
device width device-width is easy to

140
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:25,610
understand with an iPhone because Apple

141
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:28,130
is saying yeah so forget how many pixels

142
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:31,790
there really are there are 320 pixels as

143
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:33,620
far as you're concerned you the CSS

144
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:38,680
developer so the device width is 360

145
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:42,740
except that different mobile devices

146
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:46,790
will specify a different number for how

147
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:49,670
wide their device is that number bears

148
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:51,800
no resemblance to how many pixels wide

149
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:54,230
the screen is it could be one to one it

150
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:56,630
could be one point five to one one point

151
00:06:56,630 --> 00:06:59,360
six six six repeating to one two three

152
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,980
could be anything

153
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:03,560
number device with its not listed

154
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,690
anywhere you'll have to query it somehow

155
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:08,300
with JavaScript or something or just

156
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:09,650
read up on the specs I guess although

157
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:11,450
they almost never list the device width

158
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:16,760
on the you know box and also when you

159
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,410
turn your phone sideways the device

160
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:20,180
width could change or it could stay the

161
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:22,340
same depending on what OS you're running

162
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:27,620
so what are we going to do with this

163
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:29,810
plura proliferation of device widths

164
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:31,610
because our mobile site depends on

165
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:34,550
telling our viewport to be the same

166
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:36,880
width as the device width or rather the

167
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,110
invisible browser behind the viewport to

168
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:43,880
be the width of your device you might

169
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,640
have a 320 pixel wide visual design that

170
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,980
looks like this and you might be able to

171
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:50,720
get it to look like this on a phone and

172
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,910
you might think oh I'm 80% done because

173
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:56,780
it looks like this on a phone are your

174
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:59,030
designers okay with how it's gonna look

175
00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:01,520
on an Android device that has a device

176
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,460
width of 360 the banner ad is boots

177
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:07,190
banner ad is no longer flush to the

178
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:09,800
sides and the buttons on either side of

179
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,540
the logo are starting to spread out and

180
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:14,510
the even margins around the image are

181
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:17,450
starting to get uneven and then you go

182
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:19,670
up to a galaxy note and it gets worse

183
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:22,760
which again your designers may be able

184
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,500
to live with this you may show this to

185
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:27,500
them and they're like that's fine are

186
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:30,020
your designers fine with this when the

187
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:33,320
device width goes to 640 the designers

188
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,610
at the company that I work for are not

189
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:38,840
ok with this more to the point even if

190
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,940
the designers of your company are yeah

191
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:42,800
they can live with this you're still

192
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,330
going to get passive-aggressive emails

193
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:46,130
from your advertisers saying hey just

194
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:47,570
check the site on the iPhone the ads

195
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:50,180
look great but on the Android there's

196
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:51,680
some weird padding around the size of

197
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,240
the ads so if you can just fix that

198
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:57,370
that'd be cool

199
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:58,760
and I know what you're thinking you're

200
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,830
thinking yeah no problem I'm just gonna

201
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:02,300
throw some media queries on there and

202
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:04,160
I'll scale things up and I'll flush

203
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:07,330
things out and it's all going to be fine

204
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:09,560
really are you really going to add

205
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,910
another media query every time another

206
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:13,530
Android comes out with another screen

207
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:15,720
size because I can guarantee you three

208
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,400
more Android devices were announced

209
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:20,180
while I was giving this talk I'm sure

210
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:23,400
this is not a scalable solution you

211
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,650
can't just have a media query that just

212
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:27,720
gets longer and longer as your site gets

213
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,880
older or I guess maybe you'll get to

214
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,620
edit some of the ones off the top as

215
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:33,720
those devices have browser shares that

216
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,520
you know drop low enough that you don't

217
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:39,210
have to support them anymore there is

218
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:42,180
another way The Wall Street Journal site

219
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:44,880
that I built for mobile doesn't use any

220
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,010
media queries and it doesn't use any

221
00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:49,380
Android style sheets it's one site that

222
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:51,240
displays exactly the same on all

223
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:54,750
browsers but to achieve that you have to

224
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:56,940
understand how these different browsers

225
00:09:56,940 --> 00:10:00,240
think because each of them has quirks

226
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,160
each of them has things that really

227
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:05,430
don't work and yet they're broken in

228
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:08,340
really different ways that reflect the

229
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:10,800
mentality behind the OS and the browser

230
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,680
that they ship with so everybody

231
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:17,910
remembers this guy Apple tends to have a

232
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:20,070
approach when it comes to building

233
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:22,290
things which is find the best possible

234
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:25,860
solution polish it as much as you can

235
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:28,560
release it and then try to prevent

236
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,210
anyone from using any other way of doing

237
00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:33,270
it that seems to have worked out pretty

238
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:37,800
well for them so far but what's best for

239
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:40,860
apples users might not be best for the

240
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:44,970
developers when I rotate my web browser

241
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:48,210
sideways on a phone the browser scales

242
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:50,430
up the site even though I didn't really

243
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:52,830
ask it to do that and there's no

244
00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:55,220
checkbox that makes it stop doing that

245
00:10:55,220 --> 00:11:00,120
but you know apples helping you some of

246
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:02,700
you may know this guy Doug Bowman was a

247
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:06,240
Google designer who quit in 2009 kind of

248
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:11,990
publicly and he ran afoul of Google's

249
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:15,230
engineering driven mindset and an

250
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:17,940
approach that I guess you could

251
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:20,910
summarize as put it out first and we'll

252
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:24,660
update it in github later you know it's

253
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:25,560
you know will

254
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,930
thinker with it as we go it's very

255
00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:30,020
markedly different from Apple's approach

256
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:32,160
well you have to keep in mind when

257
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,540
you're troubleshooting these two

258
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:34,980
different browsers and I understand

259
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:36,090
their other mobile browsers out there

260
00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:40,800
but this is a 25-minute talk so Mobile

261
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,230
Safari original goal when it was

262
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:47,190
introduced was to make desktop sites

263
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:50,850
navigable on a tiny viewport it wasn't

264
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:54,029
to make mobile optimized sites easy to

265
00:11:54,029 --> 00:11:56,430
use or easy to build for that matter so

266
00:11:56,430 --> 00:11:58,290
you will be working against this bias

267
00:11:58,290 --> 00:11:59,930
when you try to build a mobile site

268
00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:04,140
because a lot of the things that the

269
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:06,120
browser is doing are geared towards

270
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:08,670
desktop sites Android on the other hand

271
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:10,380
was released after the iPhone had

272
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:12,060
already achieved like a 95 percent

273
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:13,890
market share when it was the only game

274
00:12:13,890 --> 00:12:16,560
in town and so their goal was to rapidly

275
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:20,990
make up for lost time and a lot of their

276
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:24,930
original quirks and presets and default

277
00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:27,240
behaviors were based on essentially

278
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:31,860
trying to masquerade as an iPhone for

279
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:34,800
lack of a better word I don't know how

280
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,180
many of you have dealt with trying to

281
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:38,400
make sites work on a android gingerbread

282
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:41,270
device that's two point three point X

283
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:44,450
that device is I guess you could say

284
00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:47,420
intentionally if not maliciously broken

285
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:49,890
the user agent does not contain the

286
00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:51,780
words Android or Google making it almost

287
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:54,750
impossible to detect the screen

288
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:57,360
resolution when queried will lie and say

289
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,270
that it's 3:20 unless you refresh the

290
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:02,790
page and then it'll be correct I can

291
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:05,640
only assume that in their zeal to catch

292
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:09,540
up to Apple that Google kind of played

293
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:13,770
you know hard and fast with the specs

294
00:13:13,770 --> 00:13:15,540
and said it's okay because you know

295
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:17,430
we'll update it later and it'll be fine

296
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:20,730
and you know Android 4.1 is pretty good

297
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:23,310
but they started from a really bad place

298
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:25,140
and some of that cruft is still in the

299
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:29,279
browser now I don't want to make it

300
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:31,080
sound like this is just a big Android

301
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,910
bitchfest but that is going to be mostly

302
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:34,540
the rest of my talk

303
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:38,540
so of this fully fleshed out meta

304
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:39,560
viewport tag

305
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:41,630
you've got your wits equals device with

306
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:43,279
you've got an initial scale value I'm

307
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:44,480
sure most of you guys have played with

308
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,980
initial scale equals zero because that's

309
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:48,050
what everyone tells you to use minimum

310
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:51,830
scale maximum scale user scalable which

311
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:53,120
of these will Android devices

312
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:57,250
consistently conform to not one of them

313
00:13:57,250 --> 00:14:00,230
every single one of these can be ignored

314
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:02,930
under certain circumstances depending on

315
00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:06,950
what Android feels it wants to do with

316
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:10,850
equals device width is good if your site

317
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:13,010
is wider than the device width but it'll

318
00:14:13,010 --> 00:14:15,140
ignore it if it's less than the device

319
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:17,690
width so it's like okay half the time

320
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:21,410
you can set user scalable to know but if

321
00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:24,020
you then set a scale on the site it says

322
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:26,270
oh I guess user scaling is on because

323
00:14:26,270 --> 00:14:27,470
you just changed the scale and you're

324
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:29,570
like no user scaling is off developer

325
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:32,450
scaling should be on but no it's getting

326
00:14:32,450 --> 00:14:34,399
better but it's still very frustrating

327
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:35,950
to work with and as you guys know

328
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:39,500
androids installed user base upgrades

329
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,630
very slowly usually in two year cycles

330
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:45,920
so even though 4.1 is out now I don't

331
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,060
know how many years it's going to be

332
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:48,440
before all of the people with

333
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:50,720
Gingerbread devices get rid of their

334
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,660
phones and upgrade to the next one on

335
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:56,209
the other hand it's probably okay if you

336
00:14:56,209 --> 00:14:59,810
check your browser stats you'll probably

337
00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:02,990
find that no one is hitting your site

338
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:05,450
using a gingerbread Android browser

339
00:15:05,450 --> 00:15:07,040
probably because they can't get to your

340
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:11,690
site hold it what about the target

341
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:12,770
density dpi

342
00:15:12,770 --> 00:15:14,209
if you've ever developed for mobile

343
00:15:14,209 --> 00:15:16,880
you've run up against this one everyone

344
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,529
says that just like width equals device

345
00:15:18,529 --> 00:15:21,920
width you should set it to device DPI

346
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,079
and all your problems will go away your

347
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:26,120
problems will not go away for one thing

348
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:29,540
that is a deprecated attribute it was

349
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:32,060
removed from WebKit by Apple last year

350
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:34,790
and I can only assume that future

351
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:37,880
versions of Android will also drop

352
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:41,000
support for it I guess right now it is

353
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,310
the only attribute that works reliably

354
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:46,459
to style your site all of the rest of

355
00:15:46,459 --> 00:15:48,560
them are basically just for Iowa

356
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,060
this is the only one that counts on

357
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:53,800
Android I can't explain why that is but

358
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:56,839
thank me later don't set it to device

359
00:15:56,839 --> 00:15:59,870
DPI I don't know why set it to one sixty

360
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:01,759
I can't tell you why to set it to one

361
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:06,319
sixty but if your site is 320 pixels

362
00:16:06,319 --> 00:16:09,259
wide and you tell your Android to have

363
00:16:09,259 --> 00:16:12,740
target density dpi 160 it will render a

364
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:15,740
320 pixel sight at the full width of the

365
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:18,680
screen on just about any device dpi

366
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:22,610
device that you're working with 430 6321

367
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:25,970
60 should work like 89% of the time the

368
00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:27,230
rest of the time on the Wall Street

369
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:29,779
Journal we detect those devices that are

370
00:16:29,779 --> 00:16:32,839
edge cases and we give them 140 which is

371
00:16:32,839 --> 00:16:34,040
apparently the other number that works

372
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:39,319
for them I don't know why this is so

373
00:16:39,319 --> 00:16:42,290
this is a really good starting point for

374
00:16:42,290 --> 00:16:44,389
your mobile site all of these other ones

375
00:16:44,389 --> 00:16:48,259
are for Apple the maximum and minimum

376
00:16:48,259 --> 00:16:52,160
scale set to 1 will disable the zooming

377
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,959
that's a nice thing that Apple did for

378
00:16:53,959 --> 00:16:56,120
us developers prior to iOS 5 you

379
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,649
couldn't disable the zooming no matter

380
00:16:57,649 --> 00:17:00,440
what you did technically that zooming is

381
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:02,300
provided by the operating system not the

382
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:04,370
browser I would argue but it was nice of

383
00:17:04,370 --> 00:17:06,770
them to say ok if we see that in your

384
00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:09,470
meta tag we'll go ahead and not zoom for

385
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:12,919
you so that half of the meta tag makes

386
00:17:12,919 --> 00:17:14,809
your phone behave more like an Android

387
00:17:14,809 --> 00:17:16,850
device which does not Otto's oom when

388
00:17:16,850 --> 00:17:19,939
switching orientations and then the

389
00:17:19,939 --> 00:17:24,049
target density dpi makes the site fit

390
00:17:24,049 --> 00:17:26,480
properly on a wide variety of Android

391
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:31,309
screens there are some problems that

392
00:17:31,309 --> 00:17:34,220
remain problems that are not solved by

393
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:38,750
that meta tag we're still in the really

394
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:42,010
early stages of mobile web support and

395
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:44,360
there are things that you're going to

396
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:47,480
have to deal with I've got a list of

397
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:50,480
some of my favorites here I can't even

398
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:53,030
tell you a reliable way to deal with

399
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:55,460
them some of them are really really

400
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:58,490
pernicious and I've got a couple extra

401
00:17:58,490 --> 00:17:59,390
minutes I'm going to walk you through

402
00:17:59,390 --> 00:18:01,460
what you're going to be up against if

403
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:02,090
you choose

404
00:18:02,090 --> 00:18:03,919
to dive into the world of mobile

405
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:07,130
development WebKit overflowing scrolling

406
00:18:07,130 --> 00:18:09,049
touch you guys may be familiar with that

407
00:18:09,049 --> 00:18:11,390
property that's what allows a div on the

408
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:13,640
page to scroll independently of the rest

409
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:16,460
of the page people use it for nav bars

410
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:18,679
they use it for slideshows they use it

411
00:18:18,679 --> 00:18:21,049
for all kinds of things it works pretty

412
00:18:21,049 --> 00:18:25,429
well in iOS 5 and above and Android 4

413
00:18:25,429 --> 00:18:27,890
and above except if there's an iframe

414
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:29,600
anywhere on the page and this is a

415
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,150
WebKit bug it affects all the WebKit

416
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:34,010
browsers and if there's an iframe

417
00:18:34,010 --> 00:18:35,960
anywhere not in the scrollable div

418
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:38,029
anywhere on the page the page will

419
00:18:38,029 --> 00:18:39,940
freeze and stop being interactive and

420
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:43,010
people will get mad at you

421
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:46,309
fixing it is really really difficult for

422
00:18:46,309 --> 00:18:48,799
The Wall Street Journal we have a lot of

423
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:51,880
iframed ads in our content but we use

424
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:54,950
overflow scrolling touch on our Facebook

425
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:58,700
style nav bar I'm using my phone itself

426
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:01,549
for the presentation so I'll pull out

427
00:19:01,549 --> 00:19:06,649
this galaxy s4 here is the same site

428
00:19:06,649 --> 00:19:09,169
full width ads going all the way to the

429
00:19:09,169 --> 00:19:13,130
side there's our oops come on there you

430
00:19:13,130 --> 00:19:17,409
go so there's our scrollable div and

431
00:19:17,409 --> 00:19:19,399
you'll notice that the iframes

432
00:19:19,399 --> 00:19:21,529
momentarily disappeared when I opened it

433
00:19:21,529 --> 00:19:23,539
up and now they're back again in order

434
00:19:23,539 --> 00:19:26,600
to make that scrollable area work I have

435
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:30,049
to detach all iframes from the Dom save

436
00:19:30,049 --> 00:19:33,380
where they are open the apply this style

437
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:35,960
to the day of only then because if the

438
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:38,600
style co exists at any moment with an

439
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:41,330
iframe anywhere on your page the page

440
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:45,710
will die but if you don't apply the

441
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:51,440
style and you wait until the user throws

442
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:54,380
the event then you quickly detach all

443
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:55,940
the iframes apply the style open the

444
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:56,330
drawer

445
00:19:56,330 --> 00:19:58,340
now it's scrollable and then when you

446
00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:00,230
close the drawer you detach the style

447
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:02,179
reinstate all the iframes and you don't

448
00:20:02,179 --> 00:20:03,559
get angry calls from your advertisers

449
00:20:03,559 --> 00:20:07,340
asking why their ads are gone WebKit

450
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:09,409
transform scale applied to an iframe

451
00:20:09,409 --> 00:20:11,780
will blow it up it'll scale to some

452
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:14,149
crazy amount that's a known bug in

453
00:20:14,149 --> 00:20:14,730
webcam

454
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:16,890
affects all the mobile browsers that use

455
00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:19,320
WebKit and I don't have the solution for

456
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:20,940
that other than just don't try to scale

457
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:23,990
an iframe it's not going to work

458
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:26,160
Android will trigger landscape

459
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,810
orientation media queries when the

460
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:33,070
keyboard opens because Android is a dick

461
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:36,170
the reason it does this is because

462
00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:39,390
technically when your keyboard opens the

463
00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:41,850
remaining available viewport is slightly

464
00:20:41,850 --> 00:20:43,170
wider than it is tall

465
00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:45,660
so Android goes well now we must be in

466
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:51,240
landscape mode and come on you know

467
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,740
that's not what the user wants and you

468
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:54,030
know that's not what the developer wants

469
00:20:54,030 --> 00:20:55,800
and it may be technically true but it's

470
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:59,390
really pedantic I consider it a bug and

471
00:20:59,390 --> 00:21:01,860
yeah all of this stuff we've been seeing

472
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:04,410
with 3d transforms and all the you know

473
00:21:04,410 --> 00:21:06,930
crazy stocking and overlays in Z

474
00:21:06,930 --> 00:21:09,630
indexing problem on Android that is

475
00:21:09,630 --> 00:21:11,850
tough to work around but when you have

476
00:21:11,850 --> 00:21:15,270
you know flipped flipped cards and

477
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:18,390
overlaid sliding drawers and cubes and

478
00:21:18,390 --> 00:21:22,200
things if there's a anchor tag anywhere

479
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:25,080
anywhere in the stack of divs behind

480
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:27,030
where your finger is tapping it'll go

481
00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:28,710
ahead and click on that anchor tag for

482
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:33,260
you the only solution I can offer is to

483
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:35,670
set those two display:none when they're

484
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:39,870
not visible because there's no there you

485
00:21:39,870 --> 00:21:41,550
shouldn't be able to tap on them right

486
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:43,770
the event should propagate only to the

487
00:21:43,770 --> 00:21:45,300
elements that you're directly

488
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:48,530
interacting with but their tap Abul so

489
00:21:48,530 --> 00:21:50,880
these are things that I don't have easy

490
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,940
solutions for be aware of them before

491
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:57,840
you go because I spent a lot of time on

492
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:00,060
Stack Overflow finding this stuff out

493
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:02,700
and I can at least save you guys a bit

494
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:06,120
of heartache so I'm gonna go straight to

495
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:06,750
questions

496
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:11,490
and thank you for your time okay so the

497
00:22:11,490 --> 00:22:14,340
the question was are some of these bugs

498
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:17,820
fixed in Chrome for Android as opposed

499
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:19,530
to the stock browser which I guess was

500
00:22:19,530 --> 00:22:22,530
just called browser in android and the

501
00:22:22,530 --> 00:22:25,530
short answer is yes some of them Google

502
00:22:25,530 --> 00:22:27,810
is always going to preferentially treat

503
00:22:27,810 --> 00:22:28,530
their

504
00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:32,130
Chrome browser over the kind of phone

505
00:22:32,130 --> 00:22:37,850
vendor supported browser browser so I

506
00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:40,170
can't tell you which of these are fixed

507
00:22:40,170 --> 00:22:41,580
in which versions of Chrome for Android

508
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:44,010
but Chrome for Android will always have

509
00:22:44,010 --> 00:22:46,500
the latest WebKit available for that OS

510
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:48,210
and it'll always perform a little bit

511
00:22:48,210 --> 00:22:49,950
better because Google is biased towards

512
00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:51,840
in and it always gives it the latest and

513
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:54,090
greatest so yes but probably some of

514
00:22:54,090 --> 00:22:56,040
those bugs are still there I've seen

515
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:58,020
lots of angry threads on Stack Overflow

516
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:01,440
and other sites about development where

517
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,240
people are complaining that Google seems

518
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:06,120
to remember that they give Android away

519
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:10,200
for free they seem to not terribly

520
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:13,650
prioritize but bugs even known bugs I've

521
00:23:13,650 --> 00:23:16,050
seen them stay unfixed for more than a

522
00:23:16,050 --> 00:23:17,870
year more than two years in some cases

523
00:23:17,870 --> 00:23:20,250
serious bugs that hamper your ability to

524
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:23,520
use the site but I think there's reason

525
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:26,010
to be optimistic if Google decides to

526
00:23:26,010 --> 00:23:28,470
throw away the browser browser and just

527
00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:31,020
standardize all forthcoming Android OS

528
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:33,150
is around their new WebKit chrome which

529
00:23:33,150 --> 00:23:34,680
again they're trying to make their

530
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:37,110
WebKit even more modern than apples so

531
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:38,610
that's probably only going to be good

532
00:23:38,610 --> 00:23:41,100
for Android users so I'm gonna say a

533
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:42,930
tentative yes to its it's a little bit

534
00:23:42,930 --> 00:23:47,340
more advanced so the question is did we

535
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:49,200
develop a separate tablet version and

536
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,090
are we handling it different than mobile

537
00:23:51,090 --> 00:23:54,270
the answer is we don't yet have a

538
00:23:54,270 --> 00:23:56,820
separate tablet version but we will when

539
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:59,130
we expand this one mobile site into a

540
00:23:59,130 --> 00:24:01,440
fully responsive site we are essentially

541
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,930
not building a Mobile's first platform

542
00:24:03,930 --> 00:24:05,970
because of course there is a wsj.com

543
00:24:05,970 --> 00:24:09,690
website right now but the mobile site

544
00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:12,570
will essentially be expanded until it

545
00:24:12,570 --> 00:24:15,060
contains everything on the desktop site

546
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:17,160
and then the desktop site will become

547
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:19,260
the responsive mobile site I mean we'll

548
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:20,550
stop calling it the mobile site at that

549
00:24:20,550 --> 00:24:25,080
point our our browser stats have shown

550
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:27,900
that a lot of iPad users are perfectly

551
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:29,730
happy to just use the desktop site on

552
00:24:29,730 --> 00:24:33,330
iPads they don't feel encumbered by the

553
00:24:33,330 --> 00:24:35,730
somewhat smaller screen size they seem

554
00:24:35,730 --> 00:24:37,350
okay with it so we haven't gotten a lot

555
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:40,190
of complaints by letting iPad or

556
00:24:40,190 --> 00:24:41,809
their tablet users use the desktop site

557
00:24:41,809 --> 00:24:43,429
people seem comfortable with it but we

558
00:24:43,429 --> 00:24:45,649
are eventually going to just responsive

559
00:24:45,649 --> 00:24:47,720
our way up where no matter what your

560
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:51,559
width is you'll get a user experience

561
00:24:51,559 --> 00:24:53,149
that is customized to that particular

562
00:24:53,149 --> 00:24:57,440
width so it's coming so the question is

563
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,899
how do you work with designers because

564
00:24:59,899 --> 00:25:02,659
they too need to be educated on all of

565
00:25:02,659 --> 00:25:07,789
the constraints and new concepts that

566
00:25:07,789 --> 00:25:09,529
are associated with mobile development

567
00:25:09,529 --> 00:25:12,529
and how do you get them the information

568
00:25:12,529 --> 00:25:14,539
that they need how do you get the

569
00:25:14,539 --> 00:25:16,840
information that you need from them

570
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:18,710
so I can only speak from my own

571
00:25:18,710 --> 00:25:20,509
experience but at the Wall Street

572
00:25:20,509 --> 00:25:22,460
Journal our visual designers are

573
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:25,250
essentially designing a 320 pixel wide

574
00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:29,240
website but their PS DS are 640 pixels

575
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:32,980
wide because of Retina displays and so

576
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:36,200
they are developing I guess what you

577
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:40,460
could say 144 dpi 320 pixel wide except

578
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:42,980
it's not really pixels anymore comps

579
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:44,389
that's what they're developing their

580
00:25:44,389 --> 00:25:47,120
developing 640 pixel Whitesides androids

581
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:50,240
now have a few devices like the one I

582
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:53,000
just showed you that has a stated device

583
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:57,019
DP device dpi of 3 sorry pixel ratio of

584
00:25:57,019 --> 00:25:59,840
three not two but I think we're

585
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:01,940
approaching something below the limits

586
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:03,799
of human perception when you go over to

587
00:26:03,799 --> 00:26:07,690
so I find that 2x sized images are

588
00:26:07,690 --> 00:26:11,840
sufficient to always look crisp and just

589
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:15,110
about any any other Android device

590
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:18,230
usually the ones with a device width of

591
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:21,590
360 they are usually working with a 1.5

592
00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:25,190
pixel ratio so you are serving slightly

593
00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:27,139
higher res images than some of the

594
00:26:27,139 --> 00:26:28,820
androids can use or for that matter an

595
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:32,870
iPhone 3GS can use but what people have

596
00:26:32,870 --> 00:26:35,029
found is that you can compress the hell

597
00:26:35,029 --> 00:26:37,730
out of retina sized images because the

598
00:26:37,730 --> 00:26:40,129
JPEG compression artifacts will also

599
00:26:40,129 --> 00:26:41,509
fall below the threshold of human

600
00:26:41,509 --> 00:26:43,730
perception so you don't have to bloat up

601
00:26:43,730 --> 00:26:45,320
your images quite as big as you think

602
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:47,419
you do you can compress them much more

603
00:26:47,419 --> 00:26:50,149
heavily and when shrunk down using you

604
00:26:50,149 --> 00:26:53,210
know CSS scaling they will still look

605
00:26:53,210 --> 00:26:53,950
pretty

606
00:26:53,950 --> 00:26:57,400
and not Jo Peggy at all but in terms of

607
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:01,180
what the designers need to know I don't

608
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:03,220
think it's possible for them to design

609
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:04,900
like this wide range of designs

610
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:06,610
especially at least the argument that

611
00:27:06,610 --> 00:27:09,280
I'm making is don't accept the stated

612
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:12,520
width of 360 or 400 just force everybody

613
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:15,040
to use the same 320 pixel sight which

614
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:16,540
means everything is based on the same

615
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:20,170
640 pixel wide PSD everybody in the

616
00:27:20,170 --> 00:27:21,850
design department knows all graphics

617
00:27:21,850 --> 00:27:25,570
have to be 2x and the fonts have to be

618
00:27:25,570 --> 00:27:28,570
set to double the size that they you

619
00:27:28,570 --> 00:27:30,400
know think of them but again if you set

620
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:33,220
your PSD to 144 DPI you can still use

621
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:35,140
the same font point size that you would

622
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:37,120
normally use and yet when you flatten

623
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:39,730
out the image it'll it'll look exactly

624
00:27:39,730 --> 00:27:41,830
right so I hope that answers your

625
00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:45,940
question do I have any more questions no

626
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:53,170
oh what oh there's one excellent is it

627
00:27:53,170 --> 00:28:00,310
is it called the HTC Jay 27 X to the

628
00:28:00,310 --> 00:28:02,530
white Nexus 4 got it

629
00:28:02,530 --> 00:28:07,720
well they that I think that happened at

630
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:09,190
least once didn't it that the white one

631
00:28:09,190 --> 00:28:13,960
had a slightly not it can happen for any

632
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,250
Adobe people here

633
00:28:15,250 --> 00:28:18,010
thanks for content-aware fill really

634
00:28:18,010 --> 00:28:20,310
makes making these graphics a lot easier

635
00:28:20,310 --> 00:28:23,100
thank you for your time

636
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:24,740
