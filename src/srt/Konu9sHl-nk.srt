1
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:06,270

so brother Ted change this is the whole

2
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:08,130
rule uh prototype chains it's one of

3
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:09,269
those you could get up and leave noun

4
00:00:09,269 --> 00:00:12,900
type lectures this sentence encapsulate

5
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:15,269
basically everything through a lot

6
00:00:15,269 --> 00:00:17,100
brother pen chains about prototype

7
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:20,039
delegation relationships it goes like

8
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:20,400
this

9
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,350
when eighty lookup fails on an object

10
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:26,910
the look I was delegated to that object

11
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:27,890
prototype

12
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:35,130
what is eighteen look yes you access a

13
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:36,660
property absolutely what does they

14
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:42,450
failed key look up a black shirt what

15
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:44,190
does a failed Keeler so if you look at

16
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:48,239
well as the property access that's okay

17
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:50,730
I'm never amazing what do you think that

18
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:52,829
when you hear fail he look up on an

19
00:00:52,829 --> 00:00:56,489
option well that's what is return

20
00:00:56,489 --> 00:00:58,710
but what describe to me the events of a

21
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:06,260
failed kilo

22
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:09,280
not to go but yes it looks in the object

23
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,520
it looks in the collection of properties

24
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:14,020
trying to find something that has that

25
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:16,390
team and it fails because the object

26
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:17,860
does not have something properly for the

27
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:19,360
key like the one you're talking about

28
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,880
I've stuff missing property name is a

29
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:24,520
failed lookout because based on the name

30
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:25,750
of the property it sounds like that

31
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:29,710
object doesn't happen so whenever that

32
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:32,320
happens you go and you look at an object

33
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:35,770
and it fails to find a property before

34
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:38,200
it truly fails and return time to find

35
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:41,680
it defers that look up to its prototype

36
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,200
it works kind of like this what's your

37
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:49,990
name froggen if I delegate my failed

38
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:52,660
lookups to program and somebody asks me

39
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:55,120
a question that I don't know the answer

40
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:57,910
to I'm going to just consult with it

41
00:01:57,910 --> 00:01:59,530
quietly in the background and then if

42
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:01,240
you tells me an answer I get to pass it

43
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:07,060
off as it might plead nolo missing

44
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:10,510
properties it seemed like like you

45
00:02:10,510 --> 00:02:12,930
worked at a law firm found at one point

46
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:17,070
you know mana keys I'm sorry

47
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:20,980
so let's is sailing you look like you

48
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:29,050
might sail coughing what do you what do

49
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:33,390
you work on every company ok analytics

50
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:37,510
analytics and statistical modeling great

51
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:39,730
somebody asked me a quest a question

52
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:43,360
pertaining to business analytics you in

53
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,970
the back

54
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:56,500
sorry hang on SEC god here's a web

55
00:02:56,500 --> 00:03:01,030
address bubble from health so in this

56
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:02,709
world where I don't know anything about

57
00:03:02,709 --> 00:03:06,400
how to compute you know important

58
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,380
statistical questions about the

59
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:10,599
analytics for businesses luckily I

60
00:03:10,599 --> 00:03:12,340
delegate to someone who does know that

61
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:29,780
now someone asked me a question about

62
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:33,130
ask me a question about something simple

63
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:42,160
like you know what's a simple topic but

64
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:44,739
I definitely found enough to motor with

65
00:03:44,739 --> 00:03:48,359
that colors ask me about colored signals

66
00:03:48,359 --> 00:03:54,549
yes what is the difference between CMYK

67
00:03:54,549 --> 00:03:58,720
and RGB CMYK is to do with additive

68
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,260
color whereas RGB is to do with subtract

69
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:07,750
so because I know the answer to that the

70
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:10,200
I was able to provide that answer

71
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:15,130
without delegating a lot of people ask

72
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:16,780
questions like well you know what

73
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:18,750
happens if something something about

74
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:20,769
questions that I do know the answer to

75
00:04:20,769 --> 00:04:23,289
when a key lookup failed on an object

76
00:04:23,289 --> 00:04:26,830
this relationship was not even engaged

77
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:29,820
in the instance where I knew the answer

78
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:31,810
it's very much when played with an

79
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:33,700
object in these properties if an object

80
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:36,550
has a property locally and you can sense

81
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:38,350
by the answer it does not consult with

82
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:42,010
it front of it but if you ask a question

83
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:45,820
and the object if you look for a

84
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:47,530
property and the object doesn't have the

85
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:50,440
property locally it secretly sent me in

86
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:50,800
the back

87
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,690
the first to its prototype object and

88
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:54,520
then passes off the results as if it was

89
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:57,129
its own now it's entirely possible for

90
00:04:57,129 --> 00:04:58,870
the key look up to fail

91
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:02,110
further up the prototype chain at which

92
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:06,150
point Braga

93
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:10,180
would do what do you think what do you

94
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:11,650
think probably would just he didn't have

95
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:16,060
that key either what's that

96
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:18,460
bail out huge well so what would that

97
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:21,740
look like what would he get back to

98
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:25,659
what's that perhaps an exception but in

99
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:27,310
JavaScript when he acts as a property

100
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:29,229
that isn't available or that object

101
00:05:29,229 --> 00:05:30,909
instead of throwing an error which would

102
00:05:30,909 --> 00:05:33,639
be a perfectly reasonable thing it gives

103
00:05:33,639 --> 00:05:36,400
you undefined so he could notice if he

104
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,740
doesn't have that property either and

105
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:40,659
give me undefined and then I'll cast off

106
00:05:40,659 --> 00:05:43,419
undefined which is kind of what you'd

107
00:05:43,419 --> 00:05:44,560
expect if there was no delegate

108
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,840
relationship I don't have it apparently

109
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:49,719
secretly silently my change of prototype

110
00:05:49,719 --> 00:05:51,639
doesn't happen so I use a say undefined

111
00:05:51,639 --> 00:05:56,440
if neither those insisting lame probably

112
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,180
had the opportunity to delegate the film

113
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:02,440
look up to his prototype it goes all the

114
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:05,110
way up the chain stops at some top-level

115
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:07,449
thing that doesn't have a prototype at

116
00:06:07,449 --> 00:06:11,139
all probably the object prototype just

117
00:06:11,139 --> 00:06:13,180
to sort of like brand any object of all

118
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:16,960
objects so all the truth you need is

119
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,340
contained in the sentence but we should

120
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:20,500
probably just explain explore the

121
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,150
situation a little bit does anybody have

122
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:26,319
any questions before we move up you

123
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,000
trying to access the property the

124
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,349
property is either available on that

125
00:06:29,349 --> 00:06:31,300
object directly or it's not if it's not

126
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:33,610
the object doesn't immediately give up

127
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:36,669
it asks the prototype object and then

128
00:06:36,669 --> 00:06:42,440
passes off whatever the prototype

129
00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:48,240
do i yes I have a little example imagine

130
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,100
there's an object that represents the

131
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:52,320
president and the precedent you set me

132
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:52,500
up

133
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:55,770
Oh baby if the president knows important

134
00:06:55,770 --> 00:06:57,840
stuff like what our strategy is right

135
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,960
like we're going to look to him for for

136
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,520
stuff about other countries supposed to

137
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04,920
work that'll be great because nobody

138
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:05,910
knew to the president were like ain't

139
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:08,250
president some of the strategy 10-piece

140
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:10,760
suite and will not watch those things

141
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:13,830
that's if you have one president and you

142
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:15,000
interact directly with it but the

143
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,740
president maybe is overworked and we

144
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:19,230
want someone kind of like handling all

145
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:20,880
of the nonsense that the president does

146
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,620
speak to worry about the president

147
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:23,670
doesn't want to remember where his

148
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:25,260
favorite sailors shop is what the phone

149
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:27,330
number is he just wants somebody when

150
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:29,700
when queried to be like oh yeah he

151
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:31,350
really liked saying this just from you

152
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:36,120
know down the street right let's say we

153
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,910
hire someone to stand in the way of the

154
00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:41,010
president and sort of be the firt the

155
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:43,170
buffer of information so that the

156
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:44,610
president is queried as seldom as

157
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:45,680
possible

158
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,210
here's the president this strategy is

159
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:51,600
peace and here's now how is just some

160
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:54,330
guy right and I go to have a look at

161
00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:55,710
look it out I'll delegate to the

162
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:59,760
president what do you think with the

163
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:02,040
goatee some reason I love calling on

164
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,510
people who are I don't know why it's

165
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:05,430
sadistic he probably was really very

166
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:07,680
important but for some reason he just

167
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,830
stands out with a point what does

168
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:15,250
up what do you think out of the gates to

169
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:19,290
the object prototype yes al has not been

170
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:20,970
specified to have any relationship with

171
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:22,920
the president of so ever we certainly

172
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,090
wouldn't want it to be the case that

173
00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:25,530
every new object that comes into

174
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:27,960
existence delegates to the first one we

175
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:28,570
put in

176
00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:31,240
let us make any sense our program should

177
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:33,040
allow us to specify objects that don't

178
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:35,140
delegate to other objects and these

179
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:36,610
object literals here these two curly

180
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:41,200
braces that's what they do so Alice is a

181
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,040
person there is no properties at all if

182
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,680
I ask if I set out to know what the

183
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,710
White House addresses and there's that

184
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:53,830
property on now then when I query out

185
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:56,260
about the White House you can say oh

186
00:08:56,260 --> 00:09:00,250
it's at 1600 but when I carry out the

187
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:02,860
strategy how does it know I was like I

188
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:04,750
don't know I mean I don't know the

189
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:06,070
president personally so I can't really

190
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:09,850
speak for right this is gonna return on

191
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:11,260
the vine this season these with the

192
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:12,850
rules that you expect it to be the case

193
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:17,170
right but what if instead of Al being a

194
00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:20,050
vanilla object what if instead that

195
00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:22,780
created him in such a way that he would

196
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:25,180
delegate I would delegate to the

197
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:28,360
president there is a function that you

198
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,860
can run it will generate this

199
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:31,870
relationship or even called object

200
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:38,750
created so instead of two curly braces

201
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:46,110
we're going to

202
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:50,009
we're going to call I think that created

203
00:09:50,009 --> 00:09:52,149
I'm gonna take this off the screen for a

204
00:09:52,149 --> 00:09:53,470
second to give you an analogy that's

205
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:57,379
gonna be easier to understand

206
00:09:57,389 --> 00:10:01,839
right here this box is they call it a

207
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:05,290
transmogrifier if we put something in

208
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:09,129
the box then we get something out the

209
00:10:09,129 --> 00:10:16,749
delegates to that bit this is gonna get

210
00:10:16,749 --> 00:10:34,540
ridiculous yes

211
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:37,500
all right so this is the transmogrifier

212
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:40,140
you put something in the top and on the

213
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:44,130
side sale this side you put something at

214
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:46,020
the top and out the side come something

215
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:48,720
that delegates to it how many objects

216
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,340
are we talking about in total in this

217
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:57,750
system two objects all right plus three

218
00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:00,870
objects we have a machine you pass an

219
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:03,180
input object into this machine and out

220
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:08,480
comes a thing

221
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:12,620
three absolutely all right here we go so

222
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:18,930
pass something in and out comes a brand

223
00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:21,900
new thing if you point to your what eww

224
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:26,730
- so I am the input and here's the thing

225
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:29,250
that delegates to me but this machine

226
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:32,250
this transmogrifier generates new

227
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:36,810
objects so if you pass me in again you

228
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:38,340
stay out there someone else would pop

229
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:40,490
out and they're beat down to things I

230
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:45,420
want

231
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:49,180
there'd be two things pointing to me I

232
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:55,550
wish I had another thing confusing so

233
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:57,920
now you can imagine I need two objects

234
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,750
both pointing to this thing that we

235
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:01,399
passed into the transmogrifier twice

236
00:12:01,399 --> 00:12:04,040
this little pantomime is super important

237
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:06,170
to your ability to reason about the

238
00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:08,110
system everybody gets these three

239
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:29,920
objects confused so in this world al

240
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:33,529
went for me the vanilla object to one

241
00:12:33,529 --> 00:12:37,750
that we get out of this transmogrifier

242
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:41,600
we passed the president in to the

243
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,420
transmogrifier and this transmogrifying

244
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:47,889
function gave us a brand new object out

245
00:12:47,889 --> 00:12:51,230
that delegates to the input object does

246
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:52,329
that make sense

247
00:12:52,329 --> 00:12:54,680
are there any questions about what this

248
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:58,759
transmogrifier problem promises good

249
00:12:58,759 --> 00:12:59,449
question

250
00:12:59,449 --> 00:13:01,000
what's the difference if you just say

251
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:06,259
new president you are asking what the

252
00:13:06,259 --> 00:13:08,509
difference is between this and another

253
00:13:08,509 --> 00:13:10,310
language construct that we haven't yet

254
00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:13,250
explored the keyword new your your

255
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:16,069
sample code fundamentally misuses the

256
00:13:16,069 --> 00:13:17,630
keyword new in a way that I would go

257
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:20,120
into a lot of detail about at the

258
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,980
lecture tomorrow morning tomorrow

259
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:23,750
morning we examine the key word new and

260
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:25,579
how it works and how it doesn't work and

261
00:13:25,579 --> 00:13:27,560
how people think it works and the very

262
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:30,680
simple rule as to what it does but right

263
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,149
now I would I would ask that you guys

264
00:13:32,149 --> 00:13:34,370
table your consideration of the keyword

265
00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:36,430
new completely for fear that we will

266
00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:39,010
lose this conversation with things that

267
00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:41,890
aren't necessarily needed so here's one

268
00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:43,810
major realization we had in the

269
00:13:43,810 --> 00:13:45,700
curriculum attack reactor is what it's

270
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,290
what allows us to teach the fundamentals

271
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:49,779
of JavaScript people learn it in the

272
00:13:49,779 --> 00:13:51,399
first four days and the first four days

273
00:13:51,399 --> 00:13:54,130
it teach people what to be the better

274
00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:57,220
part of a year maybe a little over and

275
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:59,740
one of the main realizations we had was

276
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:03,209
that the key word this can be understood

277
00:14:03,209 --> 00:14:05,649
completely in isolation of any other

278
00:14:05,649 --> 00:14:07,330
object-oriented count starts in the

279
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:09,880
language and so we teach the key word of

280
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:12,130
this first and when people bring up you

281
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:13,810
were new or prototype chains you say ah

282
00:14:13,810 --> 00:14:15,520
let's get to that minute let's just set

283
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,680
this in stone because it's an

284
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:20,020
independent concept we then stacked on

285
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:22,440
prototype chains which we're doing now

286
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,550
during which we do not need to think

287
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:26,080
about the keyword new adorned and fully

288
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,660
and completely understand

289
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:29,860
lastly we think about the keyword new

290
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:31,540
which requires us to understand the

291
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:35,020
first two so these concepts are stacking

292
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:36,279
and we're gonna get a lot of value out

293
00:14:36,279 --> 00:14:38,680
of not having to consider that he were

294
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:39,970
doing well we're considering that

295
00:14:39,970 --> 00:14:52,390
changes great question we have a

296
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:55,390
function called object.extend which you

297
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:59,620
know intuitively should copy the

298
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:01,180
president object and make a brand new

299
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:03,690
object that has all the same properties

300
00:15:03,690 --> 00:15:08,709
but notice this transmogrifier did not

301
00:15:08,709 --> 00:15:12,910
produce a replica of me right it

302
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:16,029
produced a new object that delegates to

303
00:15:16,029 --> 00:15:19,810
me and this is slightly but importantly

304
00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:22,660
different one important difference is

305
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:25,480
with mark standing here and me standing

306
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:26,050
here

307
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:29,500
I was manhood he was the output if I

308
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:32,020
have olive over time they look up stood

309
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:34,570
in will had an up-to-date version of my

310
00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:36,190
information because he's going to

311
00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:38,649
delegate them to me for the rest of his

312
00:15:38,649 --> 00:15:40,510
life he is going to remember who to

313
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:41,980
consult when he's worried about

314
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:42,610
something he doesn't

315
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:45,160
understand but if this was if if instead

316
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:48,790
we passed me into a copying machine we

317
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:51,279
were gonna duplicate of my current state

318
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:55,570
that copy time and as I changed mark

319
00:15:55,570 --> 00:15:56,980
would know nothing about the output

320
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:59,620
would know nothing about I think that

321
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:03,720
extent would create a duplicate method

322
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:06,820
for that moment in time and then no

323
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:08,350
relationship between the two objects

324
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:10,000
other than their intense similarity at

325
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,890
one moment in time they would evolve

326
00:16:11,890 --> 00:16:14,410
independently but a delegation

327
00:16:14,410 --> 00:16:19,950
relationship means that the two objects

328
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:22,600
will have a relationship for their

329
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:27,430
lifetime as long as object to is in

330
00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:29,470
existence that the gem al belong the now

331
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:30,310
is in existence

332
00:16:30,310 --> 00:16:32,380
he will delegate all his failed lookups

333
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:41,060
to the president in this case

334
00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:43,600
you would end up with two objects that

335
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,370
share all the exact properties that the

336
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:49,780
original president at that moment in

337
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:51,880
time interrogating the two objects would

338
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:54,070
look quite similar but as the president

339
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:55,810
object changes the two techniques would

340
00:16:55,810 --> 00:16:59,680
look very different one is a delegation

341
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,800
relationship that follows this rule the

342
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,110
other ISM ISM is an imagined copying

343
00:17:05,110 --> 00:17:06,250
procedure and it does what you would

344
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:08,560
expect a photocopy to do if I put notes

345
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,690
on my original book the photocopy

346
00:17:10,690 --> 00:17:12,540
doesn't change that's what a copy is

347
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:15,820
whereas a delegating object report

348
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:17,709
references the original every time

349
00:17:17,709 --> 00:17:19,870
you've interacted it's like a delegating

350
00:17:19,870 --> 00:17:20,470
object

351
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:22,030
what is your something something and

352
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:23,620
it's like well I need to know that or I

353
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:25,180
don't if I don't want to check with my

354
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:28,080
with my offspring

355
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:36,910
yes

356
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:40,230
absolutely so here we have this is the

357
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:44,700
entire in-memory model here al has this

358
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:46,320
lump property but he delegated to

359
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:49,110
president without this other property so

360
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:51,300
in my ass alum of the White House

361
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:53,700
he says it's at sixteen hundred of the

362
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:56,820
address if I ask al about strategy it's

363
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:58,620
gonna fail here fall through to the

364
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:04,520
delegate and be passed off as his own

365
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:08,940
pop quiz what what happens if we say

366
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:16,930
president dot White House no sorry

367
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:24,600
he doesn't know he delegate swear yeah

368
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:25,950
the object prototype nowhere

369
00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:28,080
particularly interesting and so when we

370
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,550
asked him about the White House he

371
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:31,230
certainly isn't going to call al be like

372
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:35,790
it's very embarrassing right he's just

373
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:37,590
gonna he's gonna loan out he's gonna be

374
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:40,500
like you know what I'm the president but

375
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:45,450
I don't know a few details unless you

376
00:18:45,450 --> 00:18:51,870
have questions details delegate to the

377
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:54,150
creator was Hakim decorate or knew he

378
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:55,260
would do is gonna be explained in detail

379
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:58,530
Imam delicate objects also delegated

380
00:18:58,530 --> 00:19:01,470
plumbing their own chain proto not be

381
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:02,580
prototypes that we've covered all of

382
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:05,340
this for method calls we use the rules

383
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:06,930
we already learned look to the left of

384
00:19:06,930 --> 00:19:08,520
the dot but it was there is what the key

385
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,350
where this will be bound to even if it's

386
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:13,920
found up the chain so if you call mark

387
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:18,510
dot jump amazingly and jump amazingly as

388
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:21,450
found as a property of me then mark will

389
00:19:21,450 --> 00:19:23,370
jump amazingly because he was to the

390
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:25,650
left of the dot marked up jump amazingly

391
00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:31,320
right does that make sense the keyword

392
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:32,910
this will be found using the rules we

393
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:34,710
already learned if it's a method call

394
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:36,060
you look to the left of the dot it

395
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:36,700
doesn't

396
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:38,520
that fall through happened and I

397
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:40,570
ultimately satisfied

398
00:19:40,570 --> 00:19:43,840
I had the property locally if I have the

399
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,670
gem amazingly method and he tried to

400
00:19:45,670 --> 00:19:47,620
access it on mark he's to the left of

401
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:50,470
the valley all-time mark dot jump

402
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:53,310
amazing we use the method invocation

403
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:59,040
binding Pat thumbs

404
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:00,970
keyword this bounds of the thing on the

405
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:14,549
left top still okay the back

406
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:19,930
Wow

407
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:24,680
and you change that whatever

408
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:26,789
yes extend works very much like a

409
00:20:26,789 --> 00:20:29,429
photocopier you're building a brand new

410
00:20:29,429 --> 00:20:32,009
duplicate that looks almost identical it

411
00:20:32,009 --> 00:20:35,539
is an identity gender identity identical

412
00:20:35,539 --> 00:20:38,279
the two objects would not triple equals

413
00:20:38,279 --> 00:20:40,799
each other because they're different

414
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:45,059
objects just like Al and the president

415
00:20:45,059 --> 00:20:47,099
are different people even if they have

416
00:20:47,099 --> 00:20:48,570
all the same information available in

417
00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:51,989
their minds it's a photocopy and so the

418
00:20:51,989 --> 00:20:53,489
two do not track over time with one

419
00:20:53,489 --> 00:20:55,440
another but delegation relationship is a

420
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,539
bit different for the lifetime of the of

421
00:20:57,539 --> 00:20:59,489
the created object it will always

422
00:20:59,489 --> 00:21:09,750
delegate field lookups to the target

423
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:12,070
I think it might have been following the

424
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:13,870
precedent of a few libraries I know that

425
00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:16,930
jQuery had already implemented extend it

426
00:21:16,930 --> 00:21:22,480
I think it is not exactly it is not

427
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,280
exactly a copy operation by some

428
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:34,310
definitions

429
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:38,980
one automated multiple right another

430
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:40,450
infant interesting thing about extends

431
00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:42,040
that you can say extend some target

432
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:44,350
object with objects with all the

433
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:46,300
properties from from tart from source

434
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:56,290
object ABCDE yes all right

435
00:21:56,290 --> 00:22:00,460
the extended operation is even more

436
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:05,350
general don't be very proud when you can

437
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:13,630
think of a thing anything so moving

438
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:17,410
right along so there's no antennas or an

439
00:22:17,410 --> 00:22:21,460
access and optics prototype there's no

440
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:24,190
way for you to know who I was delegating

441
00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:26,080
to now in newer versions of the language

442
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,660
this is less less difficult to get

443
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:32,620
access to and in some engines they

444
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:34,630
preemptively implemented ways for you to

445
00:22:34,630 --> 00:22:36,280
find out what a prototype of an object

446
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:39,370
is but believe it or not if I give you a

447
00:22:39,370 --> 00:22:43,680
random object there is no problem like

448
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:46,990
browser compatible way to tell me

449
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:48,760
exactly what that object prototype is

450
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:52,960
just go right off the map no cross

451
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:56,280
browser does that make sense

452
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:59,490
can I get a show of hands be brave here

453
00:22:59,490 --> 00:23:03,100
if you are now or were don't until a

454
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:04,660
couple sentences ago under the

455
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:08,620
impression that al dot prototype was

456
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:12,160
present a lot prototype is that

457
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:16,520
president did you think maybe a women

458
00:23:16,530 --> 00:23:19,110
just reason gonna make you feel better I

459
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:21,220
thought

460
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:23,080
okay now if you thought that was the

461
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:25,810
case and a few of you the recipes

462
00:23:25,810 --> 00:23:30,580
wouldn't fit most people seem to think

463
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:33,700
that a given object dot prototype

464
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:35,800
property refers to whatever it's going

465
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:39,460
to delegate to that's not the case and I

466
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:40,780
would like you to imagine for the moment

467
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:44,340
that there is no way for you to access

468
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:47,230
the target that the object is going to

469
00:23:47,230 --> 00:23:49,560
delegate to

470
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:53,140
so given mark you would have no way of

471
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:55,150
establishing that he's delegating

472
00:23:55,150 --> 00:23:58,390
directly to me you certainly don't have

473
00:23:58,390 --> 00:24:01,540
a way to change that association I knew

474
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:04,270
these things impossible now as I said

475
00:24:04,270 --> 00:24:06,040
this is evolving and at a certain point

476
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:07,450
in time we're going to be able to do

477
00:24:07,450 --> 00:24:15,220
this there's a there's a medium under

478
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:22,610
under proto under

479
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:25,600
academic in the chrome demography yeah

480
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,500
right

481
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:28,299
so chrome is one of those interpreters

482
00:24:28,299 --> 00:24:30,549
that shows that gives you access and in

483
00:24:30,549 --> 00:24:32,649
fact do anything to debug you can from a

484
00:24:32,649 --> 00:24:35,769
problem you can programmatically read

485
00:24:35,769 --> 00:24:37,690
the under under program under under

486
00:24:37,690 --> 00:24:39,519
property and you can even write to it

487
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:42,700
but by the standards is no way to get

488
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:44,019
access to it and there's no way to

489
00:24:44,019 --> 00:24:46,630
change those are the old six new

490
00:24:46,630 --> 00:24:49,149
standards I think still doing a lot of

491
00:24:49,149 --> 00:24:50,889
changing it but may allow us about

492
00:24:50,889 --> 00:25:00,130
finding out what it is you actually have

493
00:25:00,130 --> 00:25:02,230
it believe it or not you have never seen

494
00:25:02,230 --> 00:25:04,090
code that says object up prototype

495
00:25:04,090 --> 00:25:06,429
equals another object you will only see

496
00:25:06,429 --> 00:25:08,350
code where you change to be dot

497
00:25:08,350 --> 00:25:09,909
prototype property of a function which

498
00:25:09,909 --> 00:25:11,380
is the whole construct will explore

499
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:12,850
tomorrow that I'd like you to pretend

500
00:25:12,850 --> 00:25:18,639
you've ever seen trust me that can't be

501
00:25:18,639 --> 00:25:20,139
done two objects it can only be done to

502
00:25:20,139 --> 00:25:21,279
functions and it means something very

503
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:22,980
different than anything we've discussed

504
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:25,450
it's very confusing and it's easier if

505
00:25:25,450 --> 00:25:29,409
we evaluate how that works with regard

506
00:25:29,409 --> 00:25:31,809
to some other top when we understand

507
00:25:31,809 --> 00:25:33,010
that on the topic it'll make a lot of

508
00:25:33,010 --> 00:25:35,289
sense i right now pretend as though

509
00:25:35,289 --> 00:25:36,610
there was no such thing as a dumb

510
00:25:36,610 --> 00:25:38,320
prototype property in the whole language

511
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:43,179
panel so you can't get access to an

512
00:25:43,179 --> 00:25:45,940
object's prototype in some browsers they

513
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:47,590
expose it at top under hundred proto

514
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:53,520
under honor

515
00:25:53,530 --> 00:25:55,180
and we don't need to go over this I

516
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:57,160
would rather you guys have time to play

517
00:25:57,160 --> 00:26:07,180
with to play with the exercises there

518
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:11,190
are some basically memory racism some

519
00:26:11,190 --> 00:26:13,000
classic reasons that you would want to

520
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,730
do this but it wasn't something so

521
00:26:15,730 --> 00:26:22,230
please go if you haven't already flown

522
00:26:22,230 --> 00:26:26,350
this repo start following through the

523
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:27,760
read beat will pick up where you left

524
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:30,760
off on their EP and RTA's will be

525
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:34,720
circulating and helping you get on

526
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:38,120
stocks with any things you can stock up

527
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:39,430
cool

528
00:26:39,430 --> 00:26:45,550
oh sorry about the lectures tomorrow yes

529
00:26:45,550 --> 00:26:50,980
I can't find anything on those oh I keep

530
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:53,710
saying tomorrow is it my brain that's

531
00:26:53,710 --> 00:26:58,430
what it is

532
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:02,200
right so it's turning at 9:30 we'll be

533
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:04,170
talking about asynchronous execution and

534
00:27:04,170 --> 00:27:06,220
event systems then we'll talk about

535
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:08,710
those sharing techniques and I'm

536
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:11,260
probably going to stick something in the

537
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:15,870
little schedule here but stay tuned

538
00:27:15,870 --> 00:27:19,330
alright lastly if you were joining this

539
00:27:19,330 --> 00:27:21,370
today we'll be able to hang out with us

540
00:27:21,370 --> 00:27:24,880
on Friday it's cool we have a lot of fun

541
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,980
you're more than welcome to talk to me

542
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:28,420
or anyone from the team if you're is the

543
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:30,610
student finding out more about the

544
00:27:30,610 --> 00:27:33,640
classes that we do in San Francisco we

545
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:36,910
do this exact curriculum over and over

546
00:27:36,910 --> 00:27:39,130
again every seven weeks we have

547
00:27:39,130 --> 00:27:40,810
people coming in for an immersive class

548
00:27:40,810 --> 00:27:43,510
to learn you know JavaScript techniques

549
00:27:43,510 --> 00:27:44,970
and they come out the other side

550
00:27:44,970 --> 00:27:47,110
extremely effective to the software

551
00:27:47,110 --> 00:27:48,610
engineering stuff so it was kind of like

552
00:27:48,610 --> 00:27:50,740
the foundation that we pour so that we

553
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:53,590
can talk about more advanced concepts

554
