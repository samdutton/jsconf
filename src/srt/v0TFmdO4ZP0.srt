[Music]

2
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:21,449
hey good morning everybody as mentioned

3
00:00:21,449 --> 00:00:24,750
my name is Angelina Favreau I live in

4
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:27,270
Vancouver British Columbia Canada

5
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:29,520
sunny Vancouver it's actually not very

6
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:33,210
sunny oh and I work for a company called

7
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:35,010
steam clock software and for the last

8
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:36,449
couple years I've been building mobile

9
00:00:36,449 --> 00:00:39,449
applications for native for PhoneGap

10
00:00:39,449 --> 00:00:40,500
I've used objective-c

11
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,330
a lot of JavaScript we've also done a

12
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:44,040
couple web apps and I work with some

13
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,750
pretty talented and awesome people there

14
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:47,640
but if you talked to me yesterday you

15
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,350
got a bit of a spoiler and that's that

16
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:51,449
I'm joining Mozilla in early June to be

17
00:00:51,449 --> 00:00:53,760
working on Firefox OS so that is what I

18
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:59,400
do the web is actually my first love

19
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:00,839
I've been making websites since I was

20
00:01:00,839 --> 00:01:02,610
really small my first one was on Angel

21
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:06,750
Fire I wish I mentioned sometimes and it

22
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:08,610
was about dolphins and all it was was

23
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:10,380
basically animated gifs of dolphins so I

24
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:12,240
like to think I've come a little a

25
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,640
little bit farther since then so a

26
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,520
little bit about me I am NOT a beginner

27
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,580
at programming but I don't I'm not an

28
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:22,170
expert like I don't consider myself to

29
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:25,680
be an expert at all and so this talk is

30
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,270
actually about trying to become an

31
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:28,890
expert as someone who considers

32
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:31,110
themselves an intermediate developer we

33
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:33,030
have a lot of resources and a lot of

34
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:34,370
initiatives to get people started

35
00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:36,480
programming and Decatur to beginner

36
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:38,850
programmers and until the last year or

37
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:40,560
two it was actually really hard to find

38
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,700
articles and tutorial bits for people

39
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:46,350
who are intermediate developers who

40
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:48,510
think oh you know I don't know I'm

41
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:51,540
writing code but how do I make it better

42
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:54,330
you know and so that's a little bit

43
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:56,310
about what this talk is about so the

44
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:57,360
first things first let's get a few

45
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,950
cognitive biases out of the way because

46
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:00,840
I run into these sorts of ideas whenever

47
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:03,240
I'm teaching or presenting or when

48
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,680
people come to me and they like sort of

49
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,780
secretly disclose that their feel a bit

50
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:09,360
insecure about their programming you are

51
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:14,549
not special none of you know neither is

52
00:02:14,549 --> 00:02:16,319
anybody else so that's ok we're all on

53
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:18,720
the same page I know your mom told you

54
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,129
this when you were a kid but this is

55
00:02:20,129 --> 00:02:21,930
actually a motivational anti-pattern and

56
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:24,030
it works one of two ways either your mom

57
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:25,709
tells you they're totally special you've

58
00:02:25,709 --> 00:02:27,209
got all this natural talent with the

59
00:02:27,209 --> 00:02:28,650
violin and then maybe like you don't

60
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:29,910
practice and then

61
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:31,110
all the other people who do sort of

62
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:32,580
catch up and you don't feel so special

63
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:36,990
anymore or you know you think that maybe

64
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:38,550
if someone else was told they're special

65
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:40,560
maybe you're not special and so there's

66
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,060
some like disparity between you and the

67
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:43,800
special people often the people we think

68
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,970
who are experts we think there's

69
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:46,890
something very different about them from

70
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:49,830
from where we are and so what I wanted

71
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:51,210
to say is that nobody is born with

72
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:53,490
natural talent there are no natural born

73
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:55,800
programmers and whenever I say this

74
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,660
people get really really emotional about

75
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:59,730
this and I mean really emotional

76
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:01,140
probably because their mom told them

77
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:02,670
that they were special or probably

78
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:04,200
because if they are a good programmer

79
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,760
they like to pretend that they're

80
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:06,990
special and that there's some natural

81
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:08,880
talent and there's a whole body of

82
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,380
research out there you are all smart

83
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:12,030
individuals so I will leave it up to you

84
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:14,190
to to do your own research and take a

85
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:15,840
look there is an interesting book called

86
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,870
outliers by I think Malcolm Gladwell I

87
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:20,280
really hope I got that right that

88
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:23,850
discusses this topic at length now you

89
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:25,440
are the results of many complicated

90
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,960
interactions some of those things that

91
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:30,510
can make you seem like a natural usually

92
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:33,000
have to do with your early childhood

93
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,100
education the one thing that people like

94
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:36,900
to glom onto really quickly is genetics

95
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:38,220
and say like oh well you know maybe

96
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:40,500
there's like a gene for programming or a

97
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,240
gene for logical thinking and I'm pretty

98
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,950
sure that there are probably genes that

99
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:46,020
we can identify I mean I know there's at

100
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:48,260
least a few snps identified for

101
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:50,880
nonverbal intelligence for example but

102
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,740
it's not that simple our understanding

103
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:54,300
of genetics has come a long way in the

104
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:57,360
last 10 20 years and really the focus

105
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,730
now is on epigenetics the environmental

106
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:00,959
pressures that affect a gene expression

107
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:02,580
because even if you have like the

108
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:04,770
predisposition to you know unfortunately

109
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:07,080
have cancer you may not necessarily have

110
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:10,170
cancer if you know if you take care of

111
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:11,640
yourself if the environmental pressures

112
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:14,010
aren't there and so that's a little bit

113
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:16,410
nebulous to say that genetics are

114
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:17,640
deterministic because they just they

115
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,980
just really aren't also your early

116
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:21,810
childhood exposure to logical thinking

117
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:24,150
whether or not you had that early

118
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:25,830
childhood practice of these logical

119
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:27,780
skills and the early framing of your

120
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:30,000
relationship to logical thinking a lot

121
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,680
of people like myself who grew up in a

122
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,170
fairly all semi rural area and didn't

123
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:36,990
have a lot of positive programmer role

124
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:39,360
models like you know we were sort of

125
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,390
pulled that you

126
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:41,500
if you like math and you like

127
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,360
programming well that's never gonna go

128
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,800
anywhere why do you bother with those

129
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,720
computers and some people you know get

130
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,520
framed really early that like you know

131
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,200
math is gonna be too hard for them or

132
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,340
programming is going to be too hard for

133
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:53,200
them well I'm here to tell you today

134
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:56,770
that nobody is a natural and sorry

135
00:04:56,770 --> 00:04:57,910
that's just another Jeff about people

136
00:04:57,910 --> 00:04:59,890
not liking the logic of it they feel

137
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:02,350
like they're special so your feelings

138
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:04,390
don't matter here in spite of popular

139
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:05,980
beliefs there's no one thing that you're

140
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:08,470
destined to do purpose doesn't happen to

141
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:10,480
you any more than love does these things

142
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,340
evolve when you commit yourself fully to

143
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:14,170
something or someone and make the

144
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:16,060
decision to work through the muck so I

145
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:17,500
wanted to say that yes I mean

146
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,450
programming and math and logical

147
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:21,610
thinking can be a hard thing but that

148
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:23,650
every single person in this audience and

149
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:25,330
their kids and their friends and anybody

150
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:27,580
you meet is capable of programming and

151
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:30,460
there's so much bloody problematic

152
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:32,230
framing of this topic that it drives me

153
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:35,880
up the wall in 2006 Jeff Atwood posted a

154
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:39,310
post I guess he posted he made a post

155
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:42,310
about a academic study and I put that in

156
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:43,990
quotes because while it was put out by a

157
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:46,510
academic institution anybody who's had

158
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:48,460
any training in you know anybody's gone

159
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:49,480
and done a little bit of grad school

160
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,650
anybody who's been involved with

161
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:52,060
cognitive science and the behavioral

162
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:54,100
sciences and done research design will

163
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:56,320
read that paper and laugh because the

164
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,970
research design was very poor the sample

165
00:05:57,970 --> 00:05:59,710
size was very small and what this study

166
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:02,680
was trying to say was for students that

167
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,420
come into our programming courses at our

168
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:06,880
university we can give them a test and

169
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,460
we can tell you or sorry we can predict

170
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:10,780
how well they're going to do it the

171
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:12,040
course and we can then separate

172
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:14,730
programmers from non programmers but

173
00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:17,560
that's really problematic because the

174
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,060
way people interpreted this is the way

175
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:20,620
the media offered often interprets

176
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:22,150
things and that's very sensational and

177
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:24,430
they started to say like oh we've got a

178
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:26,710
test now to tell you no natural

179
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:28,570
programmers from from program you know

180
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:30,340
from non programmers and I was like well

181
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:32,500
no all this says that someone can tell

182
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,720
how well someone's gonna do based on how

183
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,950
they teach a course about programming

184
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:39,190
and also only considering the knowledge

185
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:40,690
and experience they have with logical

186
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:42,310
thinking up until that point which you

187
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:43,780
just don't know anything about maybe

188
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:45,370
somebody you know didn't have a good

189
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:46,990
relationship with math in school maybe

190
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:48,100
someone else who grew up with parents

191
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:49,660
who were scientists and they just loved

192
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:51,990
the stuff and so I really

193
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:53,729
I think you should take all that stuff

194
00:06:53,729 --> 00:06:55,650
with a grain of salt because it's it's

195
00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:57,479
often framed and like I say a very

196
00:06:57,479 --> 00:07:00,570
problematic way so yeah so nobody's

197
00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:02,639
special and experts are not born with

198
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,380
any natural talent so that you know

199
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:05,520
that's out of the way and that's

200
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,639
actually really awesome it's actually

201
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:10,020
really empowering because that means

202
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:11,880
that any of you have the capacity to

203
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,530
take from where you are as a programmer

204
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:15,870
and move towards expertise and move

205
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:17,160
towards mastery and feel a lot more

206
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,080
confident about the things that you do

207
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:21,930
in your job or in your side projects so

208
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:23,460
if you perhaps if you practice logical

209
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:25,259
thinking and if you practice programming

210
00:07:25,259 --> 00:07:27,840
a lot and you manage to absorb enough of

211
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,759
the you know vast amount of domain

212
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:31,770
knowledge is out there you too will

213
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:34,860
become an expert so that's pretty fun

214
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:37,050
pretty awesome so then how do you know

215
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:41,009
that you're not a beginner so clue

216
00:07:41,009 --> 00:07:43,500
number one I think is that you can use

217
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,539
the fundamentals in any language

218
00:07:45,539 --> 00:07:47,820
so by fundamentals I mean your basic

219
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:50,370
control structures like loops if-else

220
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:52,830
statements know how to do like variable

221
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:54,539
assignments I know how to do some really

222
00:07:54,539 --> 00:07:56,280
basic operations and what the what the

223
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,500
main operators are in a language if you

224
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,780
if you can kind of sit down with a new

225
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:03,840
language and get out a hello world or

226
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,789
make a very small app without having to

227
00:08:05,789 --> 00:08:07,229
know the nuances of a language or

228
00:08:07,229 --> 00:08:09,210
framework I think that you are a little

229
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:12,060
bit beyond being a beginner clue number

230
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:13,830
two you are comfortable writing code

231
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:15,900
from scratch when people are beginners

232
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:17,520
there's a definitely a pattern of they

233
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,590
grab like a third party library like

234
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:21,509
maybe jQuery has an example and they're

235
00:08:21,509 --> 00:08:22,979
like oh wow I could do so much cool

236
00:08:22,979 --> 00:08:25,949
stuff with jQuery but a lot of the time

237
00:08:25,949 --> 00:08:27,840
they'll like put jQuery in and then

238
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:28,889
they'll just put in a plug-in and then

239
00:08:28,889 --> 00:08:29,580
not touch it

240
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:31,349
I mean that's not really the same as

241
00:08:31,349 --> 00:08:34,200
programming right so I would say that

242
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,909
you know someone who's a beginner or

243
00:08:35,909 --> 00:08:38,400
just beyond being a beginner is a

244
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,839
comfortable writing code from scratch

245
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:42,360
and not just editing or gluing together

246
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,579
the pieces that they find and and just

247
00:08:44,579 --> 00:08:46,680
to be perfectly clear that is an

248
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,360
important step like just being able to

249
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,130
like get into the code and try reading

250
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:51,660
it and edit it and play with it and copy

251
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:53,670
and paste a little bit that's actually

252
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:55,110
an excellent transitional skill than

253
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:56,670
becoming a better programmer despite the

254
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:58,140
fact that a lot of people are really

255
00:08:58,140 --> 00:08:59,339
against that I think that that's

256
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:01,320
perfectly fine for beginners so if

257
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,490
you're not a beginner you're probably

258
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:03,870
comfortable at least writing some code

259
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:05,250
from scratch whether it's a couple fun

260
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:07,170
Asians are a whole you know like writing

261
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:08,520
all your code to make your single page

262
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:11,520
application work clue number three that

263
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,350
you're not a beginner when you do use

264
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:14,850
something like jQuery you peek inside

265
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:16,140
because you want to know how it works

266
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:17,760
you may not necessarily understand all

267
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:18,840
the things that are in there but you are

268
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,400
getting curious and you want to know

269
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,590
like you know what's what's going on

270
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:24,030
like how does how does this iterator

271
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:26,430
work how does you know how does this

272
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:27,900
selector stuff work and you start

273
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,130
getting in there and even if you don't

274
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:30,300
necessarily understand all that you're

275
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:33,360
at least trying to and number four you

276
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,280
may feel like their code is mediocre and

277
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:37,620
you don't really know what to do about

278
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:39,570
it and this is a really interesting one

279
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:41,220
because people will not talk about this

280
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:43,560
topic openly at events that I teach and

281
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:44,970
talk at but they'll come to me

282
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:48,150
personally later on and they'll tell me

283
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:49,350
and it's very interesting because

284
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:52,260
there's no real like trend about like

285
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:54,090
gender or ethnic background or anything

286
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:54,630
like that

287
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:56,340
it's literally like all sorts of people

288
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:59,640
be like hey so I mean I I think you're

289
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:03,030
good at JavaScript they'll say so I feel

290
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:04,770
really mediocre I feel like there's all

291
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:06,480
this pressure for me to be really good

292
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,460
really fast because it's a community of

293
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:10,680
really smart people and I'm like I feel

294
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:13,770
that I feel you I know them feels and so

295
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:14,730
if you have that feeling you're not

296
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:18,690
alone and you know so okay so those are

297
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:20,430
some ways that you know that you are not

298
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:22,110
a beginner well how do you know that

299
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:24,240
you're not an expert right I mean if

300
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,620
you're not a beginner I mean maybe maybe

301
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:27,390
you're an expert clue number one

302
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:29,430
you don't quite rock all the code you

303
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:31,710
read including comments so maybe you do

304
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:33,510
get into the jQuery source and maybe

305
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:34,860
there are some comments but you still

306
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:35,880
don't really understand what they're

307
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,290
doing with bind and you know that

308
00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:38,400
there's these things called call and

309
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,750
apply and you don't understand why

310
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:41,040
there's like two versions of what seems

311
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,810
to be doing the same thing and and you

312
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:44,339
start like exposing yourself to some

313
00:10:44,339 --> 00:10:46,950
more higher level concepts this way and

314
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:48,660
so if you don't quite understand all

315
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:50,670
those things you read probably probably

316
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:54,360
you're not quite an expert clue number

317
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,490
two is that you can't explain what you

318
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:58,320
know some people like to argue with me

319
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,760
that there are plenty of competent

320
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,490
developers that are awesome but you know

321
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:05,030
can't for the life of them explain their

322
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:07,800
methodology or their practice or what

323
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,839
their coding to someone else I think

324
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:11,760
that this is a big problem and even if

325
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,100
you are you know you know further on

326
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:14,690
other

327
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:16,790
avenues of expertise like maybe you do

328
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:18,290
understand bind and call and apply for

329
00:11:18,290 --> 00:11:21,200
example but you can't explain what you

330
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,510
know to someone in a patient and clear

331
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:26,480
way that's a shortcoming and you need to

332
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,560
get better at that because programmers

333
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:29,180
need to be able to communicate and

334
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:30,470
disseminate knowledge between one

335
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:32,240
another and with their teams that they

336
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:37,160
work with and so clue number three you

337
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:39,440
aren't confident debugging this one for

338
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,880
me like took a long time like for me to

339
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:43,340
actually really get into the debugger in

340
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:44,570
like Chrome and then when I'm working

341
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:46,250
with Objective C and in Xcode and stuff

342
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:48,680
like that and to develop like sort of a

343
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:50,810
mental model of how I could solve

344
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:52,130
various problems with different

345
00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:53,870
debugging strategies rather than just

346
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:56,570
doing this you know I throw in some

347
00:11:56,570 --> 00:11:58,190
console logs all over the place

348
00:11:58,190 --> 00:11:59,540
especially you know when I started using

349
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:01,190
node I was a bit of a late adopter to

350
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:02,720
node and I started realizing I was like

351
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:06,100
oh oh this is why I need callbacks okay

352
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:08,660
I like he just kind of stopped right

353
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:11,810
there and then clue number four is do

354
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:16,730
you rely on references too much so it's

355
00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:19,310
really interesting that most of us who

356
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:21,230
are employed as software engineers or

357
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:22,550
web developers or whatever your title is

358
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:24,230
if you're writing code all day probably

359
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:25,700
you do have a tab open in your browser

360
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:29,420
that is a language reference or a API

361
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:30,800
reference of some sort because to

362
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,630
memorize all of the stuff is kind of

363
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:34,580
crazy and these things are changing

364
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:36,470
constantly too but I think that you

365
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:38,270
should be writing a large amount of your

366
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:40,190
code for example particularly vanilla

367
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:41,900
JavaScript in this case without

368
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:43,970
necessarily needing to refer to a

369
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:45,590
reference I mean if you need to once in

370
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:48,110
a while then that's fine but I mean you

371
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:49,910
should probably aim to write as much

372
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:52,640
with as little reference as possible and

373
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:54,140
the reason for this is just that you

374
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:56,210
will probably accomplish more honestly

375
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:57,290
you won't be stopping and getting

376
00:12:57,290 --> 00:12:59,300
derailed and you can write code with

377
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:00,500
confidence when you know and you've

378
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:03,440
internalized those little bits so if

379
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,120
this describes you if you are not a

380
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,740
beginner and you are not an expert

381
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:08,720
welcome to the ambiguous zone of

382
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,970
intermediate Ness you are not alone I am

383
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:14,810
there with you and so from going from

384
00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:17,030
there what does a curriculum for mastery

385
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:19,880
actually look like and also what makes a

386
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,650
great programmer and let's start with

387
00:13:21,650 --> 00:13:24,110
that second one so it really depends

388
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:25,850
who's asking and these this is a little

389
00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:27,680
bit of a quote written by a gentleman

390
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:28,160
named

391
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,230
Wiesmann who's writing I really really

392
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:32,990
love he is well I know he's definitely

393
00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:34,370
older than I am but he's got something

394
00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:36,350
like 30 or 40 years of experience maybe

395
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:38,089
more than that in programming and he's

396
00:13:38,089 --> 00:13:39,290
written actually really interesting

397
00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:40,940
ebook that's great for programmers of

398
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:42,529
all levels but particularly if you're

399
00:13:42,529 --> 00:13:45,019
starting out if you're just google ed

400
00:13:45,019 --> 00:13:46,699
Weissman you'll be able to find it and I

401
00:13:46,699 --> 00:13:48,350
read this book and it just it really it

402
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:50,839
really got to me in a good way because

403
00:13:50,839 --> 00:13:52,850
he answered a lot of sort of ideological

404
00:13:52,850 --> 00:13:54,410
questions about the field of programming

405
00:13:54,410 --> 00:13:56,389
that I'd been asking myself and

406
00:13:56,389 --> 00:13:57,860
questioning like do I want to I don't

407
00:13:57,860 --> 00:13:59,889
want to keep doing this short answer yes

408
00:13:59,889 --> 00:14:03,290
so who is a good programmer it depends

409
00:14:03,290 --> 00:14:05,240
who was asking - a project manager the

410
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,589
programmer who hits every deadline

411
00:14:06,589 --> 00:14:07,970
regardless of quality is a good

412
00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:09,920
programmer to the customer the

413
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,120
programmer who solves the problem the

414
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,250
fastest is a good programmer to the

415
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:14,689
business owner the programmer who makes

416
00:14:14,689 --> 00:14:16,220
them the most money that's a good

417
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:18,079
programmer and to the junior programmer

418
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:20,420
the best mentor is a good programmer and

419
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:22,189
to another programmer the programmer

420
00:14:22,189 --> 00:14:23,720
that they're most likely to want in to

421
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:26,230
go to battle with is a good programmer

422
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:29,149
so what do I need to learn to be an

423
00:14:29,149 --> 00:14:30,889
expert and like how do you how do you

424
00:14:30,889 --> 00:14:34,040
even do that you know what do you do you

425
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,449
want to feel unstuck so I'm going to

426
00:14:35,449 --> 00:14:36,920
give you some suggestions here and a

427
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:38,870
little bit of ideas for materials so

428
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:41,000
that you too can transform yourself from

429
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,839
being intermediate into being an expert

430
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:48,399
so suggestion number one please ask why

431
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:51,050
obsessively short of existential angst

432
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:53,600
like all the time I mean I'm talking

433
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,160
specifically about code right now but I

434
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,779
mean like just in general with with your

435
00:14:56,779 --> 00:14:58,160
life I mean you can ask yourself like

436
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,750
why did I choose eggs benedict this

437
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:02,720
morning or why did why did I choose more

438
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,970
better example why did I choose to use

439
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:07,959
jQuery like why why did I want to do my

440
00:15:07,959 --> 00:15:10,220
why did I why did I choose like Twitter

441
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:12,050
Twitter bootstrap is because I am

442
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:13,910
uncomfortable in the front end why did I

443
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:16,250
choose nodejs to do all my server stuff

444
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:17,389
I mean aside from it's really cool

445
00:15:17,389 --> 00:15:18,680
everybody in this room probably really

446
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:20,569
likes it but like why did you make that

447
00:15:20,569 --> 00:15:22,699
decision why did you use express as your

448
00:15:22,699 --> 00:15:24,379
as your framework for your routes and

449
00:15:24,379 --> 00:15:27,199
all that so ask why obsessively to the

450
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:29,660
point where you annoy yourself it will

451
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:31,040
give you a tremendous amount of

452
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,660
self-awareness about the choices that

453
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:33,920
you're making when you're doing

454
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:37,040
development so number two I really think

455
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,809
that you should teach or speak at an

456
00:15:38,809 --> 00:15:40,499
event there's this illusion

457
00:15:40,499 --> 00:15:42,059
you're standing up here that you're an

458
00:15:42,059 --> 00:15:44,429
expert I like to think like I say I'm on

459
00:15:44,429 --> 00:15:45,569
my way to being an expert but I'm

460
00:15:45,569 --> 00:15:47,729
definitely not an expert the only thing

461
00:15:47,729 --> 00:15:50,129
you need to come up here and speak is an

462
00:15:50,129 --> 00:15:51,509
idea about something that you've made

463
00:15:51,509 --> 00:15:53,309
and like the previous presentation where

464
00:15:53,309 --> 00:15:55,829
Remy was showing his experiment that's a

465
00:15:55,829 --> 00:15:57,389
perfect example if you've done something

466
00:15:57,389 --> 00:15:58,889
like that you need to tell people about

467
00:15:58,889 --> 00:16:00,389
it and share the knowledge that you have

468
00:16:00,389 --> 00:16:02,639
with others and what happens when you're

469
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:04,709
you know teaching or speaking at an

470
00:16:04,709 --> 00:16:07,379
event is that you get to sort of

471
00:16:07,379 --> 00:16:10,649
formalize and sort of make the ideas

472
00:16:10,649 --> 00:16:11,879
that you have about what you've worked

473
00:16:11,879 --> 00:16:13,589
on a little bit more concrete if you can

474
00:16:13,589 --> 00:16:14,819
communicate those effectively you

475
00:16:14,819 --> 00:16:17,309
probably know the area pretty well and

476
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:19,169
when it comes to teaching I teach at

477
00:16:19,169 --> 00:16:20,939
ladies zoning code and I also do some

478
00:16:20,939 --> 00:16:23,639
stuff for Simon Fraser University and

479
00:16:23,639 --> 00:16:26,909
that is super enlightening because it's

480
00:16:26,909 --> 00:16:28,589
a really good reflection on the kinds of

481
00:16:28,589 --> 00:16:30,389
assumptions you make about your own

482
00:16:30,389 --> 00:16:32,369
ability for example it ladies learning

483
00:16:32,369 --> 00:16:33,809
code I get people asking me questions

484
00:16:33,809 --> 00:16:36,179
like well okay I've sort of worked ahead

485
00:16:36,179 --> 00:16:37,919
in the slides and now I have this piece

486
00:16:37,919 --> 00:16:39,719
of code that I want to reuse should I

487
00:16:39,719 --> 00:16:42,119
copy and paste it and I'm like no you

488
00:16:42,119 --> 00:16:43,859
shouldn't do that you need functions and

489
00:16:43,859 --> 00:16:46,409
people will often add or ask really

490
00:16:46,409 --> 00:16:48,179
really compelling questions that cause

491
00:16:48,179 --> 00:16:50,369
you to realize oh I actually know a lot

492
00:16:50,369 --> 00:16:52,619
more than I thought about programming so

493
00:16:52,619 --> 00:16:53,939
I also suggest working through a

494
00:16:53,939 --> 00:16:57,059
suggested curriculum of books this is

495
00:16:57,059 --> 00:16:58,979
from John Resig website that he's had up

496
00:16:58,979 --> 00:16:59,879
for a little while called

497
00:16:59,879 --> 00:17:02,879
learning advanced JavaScript and if you

498
00:17:02,879 --> 00:17:04,079
can go through this this was sort of

499
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:06,000
like a proposed curriculum for advanced

500
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,879
JavaScript which eventually evolved

501
00:17:08,879 --> 00:17:10,949
itself into this book the secrets of the

502
00:17:10,949 --> 00:17:12,959
JavaScript ninja which I think has a

503
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:16,169
samurai on the front and this book is

504
00:17:16,169 --> 00:17:17,909
really fantastic for me to read because

505
00:17:17,909 --> 00:17:19,799
I keep going through it oh pardon me I

506
00:17:19,799 --> 00:17:22,019
keep going through it and realize that

507
00:17:22,019 --> 00:17:23,369
there's a lot in that book that is

508
00:17:23,369 --> 00:17:25,259
totally rehash for me and I already know

509
00:17:25,259 --> 00:17:26,970
but there's a lot of stuff in there I

510
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:28,679
don't know so reading a book like this

511
00:17:28,679 --> 00:17:31,769
that has a comprehensive sort of outline

512
00:17:31,769 --> 00:17:34,200
of topics of mastery for JavaScript will

513
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,090
help you reaffirm what you know and what

514
00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:37,440
you don't know and that's a really good

515
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,519
feeling I like to read through a book

516
00:17:38,519 --> 00:17:40,230
and be like yeah I got that or to

517
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:42,000
discover that like you had no idea about

518
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,980
function memorization that totally blew

519
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:46,799
my mind for example experiment

520
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:48,779
recklessly the code doesn't care this is

521
00:17:48,779 --> 00:17:50,580
suggesting number four the code does not

522
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:52,230
care how old you are who you are where

523
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:53,169
you came from

524
00:17:53,169 --> 00:17:55,539
anything like that nobody needs to see

525
00:17:55,539 --> 00:17:56,830
your code till you push it up to the

526
00:17:56,830 --> 00:17:58,269
branch that you need to push it to or

527
00:17:58,269 --> 00:18:00,009
until you need to show it to someone

528
00:18:00,009 --> 00:18:02,080
else for code review so experiment be be

529
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,239
reckless like do silly things just to

530
00:18:04,239 --> 00:18:05,679
see what happens the code

531
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:07,059
it's just code it's a nerd until you

532
00:18:07,059 --> 00:18:10,389
give it purpose so number five you

533
00:18:10,389 --> 00:18:11,980
should have opinions if you're

534
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:14,230
progressing towards I guess an expert

535
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:15,940
level of understanding and knowledge you

536
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:17,259
will probably naturally start to have

537
00:18:17,259 --> 00:18:19,779
opinions although it's really important

538
00:18:19,779 --> 00:18:20,889
to remember that when you're having

539
00:18:20,889 --> 00:18:23,200
opinions that and you're trying to sort

540
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,690
of cooperate with people that you're

541
00:18:25,690 --> 00:18:27,100
gonna run into people that you disagree

542
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:28,809
with and there's a little song that I

543
00:18:28,809 --> 00:18:30,580
like on the internet about that and it

544
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:33,429
goes something like this it's okay to

545
00:18:33,429 --> 00:18:35,559
not like things but don't be a jerk

546
00:18:35,559 --> 00:18:36,820
about the things you don't like

547
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:41,289
so just internalize that please and I

548
00:18:41,289 --> 00:18:43,029
really like this one by Emily everybody

549
00:18:43,029 --> 00:18:44,409
we're having opinions on things again

550
00:18:44,409 --> 00:18:46,239
don't forget to state yours this fact or

551
00:18:46,239 --> 00:18:47,830
s you don't get to play so just you know

552
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:50,710
be be reasonable and also accept that

553
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:52,359
you could be wrong and that being wrong

554
00:18:52,359 --> 00:18:54,220
is actually fantastic because there's an

555
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:56,590
opportunity for learning there so number

556
00:18:56,590 --> 00:18:58,539
six seek mentorship if you're here

557
00:18:58,539 --> 00:18:59,859
you're probably already in the right

558
00:18:59,859 --> 00:19:02,409
place but also in your workplace one of

559
00:19:02,409 --> 00:19:03,669
the most fantastic things about working

560
00:19:03,669 --> 00:19:05,499
at steam clock software is being able to

561
00:19:05,499 --> 00:19:07,029
turn around to Allen pike who is one of

562
00:19:07,029 --> 00:19:09,070
the co-founders you'd be like hey so I

563
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:11,080
have this ridiculous sounding JavaScript

564
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:12,909
idea and or question and then we just go

565
00:19:12,909 --> 00:19:14,350
to the whiteboard and talk about it with

566
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:17,289
like no you know weirdness about it like

567
00:19:17,289 --> 00:19:18,549
I know that it's not always easy for

568
00:19:18,549 --> 00:19:21,220
some people in their jobs to do that but

569
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:23,559
if you can't do that in your job try and

570
00:19:23,559 --> 00:19:24,850
find another job where you can do that

571
00:19:24,850 --> 00:19:27,039
you will become a better programmer so

572
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:30,190
Justin 7 program a lot suggestion 8 stop

573
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:31,989
 programming sometimes you need

574
00:19:31,989 --> 00:19:33,909
programming sometimes you need
breaks ok you like to think you can code

575
00:19:33,909 --> 00:19:36,399
24/7 your brain doesn't work that way it

576
00:19:36,399 --> 00:19:38,109
needs it needs breaks that's why when

577
00:19:38,109 --> 00:19:39,429
you like are trying to fall asleep or

578
00:19:39,429 --> 00:19:40,720
you're in the shower BAM you'll know how

579
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,429
to fix that bug you need time away from

580
00:19:42,429 --> 00:19:45,369
the computer suggestion 9 write

581
00:19:45,369 --> 00:19:47,889
JavaScript a lot suggestion 10 write in

582
00:19:47,889 --> 00:19:49,720
another language for a while actually I

583
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:50,739
mean you should probably be writing

584
00:19:50,739 --> 00:19:53,109
mostly in JavaScript but if you get

585
00:19:53,109 --> 00:19:54,489
outside your comfort zone a little bit

586
00:19:54,489 --> 00:19:55,899
and start comparing JavaScript with

587
00:19:55,899 --> 00:19:58,749
other languages you'll find that there

588
00:19:58,749 --> 00:20:00,309
are a lot of little nuances to

589
00:20:00,309 --> 00:20:01,690
JavaScript that maybe you didn't know

590
00:20:01,690 --> 00:20:03,220
and programming in another language

591
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:05,230
exercises the brain much in the way that

592
00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:05,920
learning I know

593
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:09,970
spoken language would in a sense number

594
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:11,980
11 think like a programmer when afk

595
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:13,600
people think I'm really weird for

596
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,280
optimizing my route when I go to Ikea

597
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,690
and figuring it look the optimal way to

598
00:20:16,690 --> 00:20:18,310
get through it as fast as possible and

599
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:20,350
that might be silly to some of you but

600
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:21,580
that'sthat's great like you should be

601
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:23,110
doing those sorts of thought exercises

602
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:24,720
as much as you possibly can because that

603
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,010
exercises the logical part of your brain

604
00:20:27,010 --> 00:20:28,420
which is largely well that's what you

605
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:31,120
need for programming and suggestion 12

606
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:33,400
know what good feedback is and reject

607
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,740
all else it turns out that some people

608
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:37,180
aren't very happy with themselves and

609
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:38,290
they will take it out on you

610
00:20:38,290 --> 00:20:39,940
so sometimes on the internet someone

611
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:41,800
will reply to your question or your post

612
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:45,820
and honestly like if they're not being

613
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:47,440
constructive and they throw in at the

614
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:50,440
fit so they say something mean tone is a

615
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:52,750
bit of a variable one then you know

616
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:54,460
honestly if you're not getting anything

617
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:56,230
constructive out of it probably it's a

618
00:20:56,230 --> 00:20:57,400
waste of your time there will be someone

619
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,330
else who can give you constructive

620
00:20:58,330 --> 00:21:00,070
criticism so just know how to

621
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:01,660
differentiate between good feedback and

622
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:04,960
troll feedback the last one really

623
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,310
that's a suggestion is to break free of

624
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:09,430
imposter syndrome it just has so happens

625
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:10,810
that if you write code you are a

626
00:21:10,810 --> 00:21:13,330
programmer the end relative of your

627
00:21:13,330 --> 00:21:14,860
ability people that come out of the

628
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:16,150
beginner JavaScript courses that I teach

629
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:18,100
tell me that they want to be quote a

630
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:20,470
real programmer one day and I ask them

631
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:22,540
like okay well are you writing code yeah

632
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:24,430
I know I'm writing code every day okay

633
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:26,200
great you're a programmer no no Angelina

634
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,000
I want to be a real programmer and what

635
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:28,930
they're actually trying to say is that

636
00:21:28,930 --> 00:21:31,240
they want to be good and so hopefully if

637
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,620
you are someone at home that gets to see

638
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:34,150
this video and maybe you are in this

639
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:36,340
nebulous intermediate zone you will

640
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:37,930
understand that yes you are a programmer

641
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:39,580
and your desire to want to be good is

642
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:41,560
good and you will get there I promise if

643
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:43,930
you do some of these things and I want

644
00:21:43,930 --> 00:21:45,490
you to fall in love with your process I

645
00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:46,480
want you to fall in love with the

646
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,370
balance between writing code and taking

647
00:21:48,370 --> 00:21:49,630
breaks I want you to fall in love with

648
00:21:49,630 --> 00:21:51,760
the process of like you know arguing

649
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,320
your point and then taking the opposite

650
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:55,060
position because this sort of variety is

651
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:56,830
what's going to help you grow as a

652
00:21:56,830 --> 00:21:58,720
person it's going to expand your self

653
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,310
awareness and hopefully make you a

654
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:01,630
better critical thinker about your

655
00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:03,700
programming and so this is the end of my

656
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:05,560
presentation thank you wonderful humans

657
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:07,480
