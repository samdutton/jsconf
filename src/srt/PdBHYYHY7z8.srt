1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,210

so everybody i'm mateus i go by math

2
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:06,600
intosh on tour and get up so max said

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:09,150
that he was told this morning that he

4
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:11,969
had to do a talk I was literally told 20

5
00:00:11,969 --> 00:00:16,160
minutes ago they had to do a talk right

6
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:19,730
so this is going to be highly improvised

7
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:22,470
so I'm gonna try to stick with the idea

8
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:23,880
that Michael talked about of having like

9
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:26,580
a flu so I also i also work on the debt

10
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:29,699
project with max where we do like fun

11
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:31,529
stuff with replication right so one of

12
00:00:31,529 --> 00:00:32,969
the examples i'm going to just cannot

13
00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:34,890
light types on mice nights because i

14
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:38,219
have nothing basically so like one of

15
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:40,379
the slides the net max sure what's

16
00:00:40,379 --> 00:00:43,789
coming like this right like dr. Ron

17
00:00:43,789 --> 00:00:51,570
thing think so like I'm very interested

18
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:54,300
in like this step right here right the

19
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:56,160
daughter run think so has anybody here

20
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,690
actually try to using daughter because

21
00:00:57,690 --> 00:00:58,920
like I run into this all the time where

22
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:00,210
people have heard about daughter but

23
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:01,289
haven't tried it all right has anybody

24
00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:03,589
tried pulling an image from the registry

25
00:01:03,589 --> 00:01:05,760
right that's a pain in the ass right I

26
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,580
mean can we all agree on that I mean I

27
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:09,570
don't know what they do with that

28
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:10,950
registry by think it's located in

29
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:12,420
California because I'm from committing

30
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:15,320
and cross-atlantic latency thing like

31
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:17,250
literally every time I try to do

32
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:18,450
something with it takes two seconds

33
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:19,950
because it has to do it's the P

34
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:21,330
connection for every layer and it's like

35
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:23,880
you end up wanting to kill someone which

36
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,470
is kind of annoying because they're

37
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:27,659
killing people are illegal is illegal so

38
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:32,670
I mean anyways so I wrote this thing

39
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:36,600
called torn stream which is like it's a

40
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:39,360
note module kind of touching like if a

41
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,619
reference back to a node weight talk

42
00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:43,470
it's like a small no module that's one

43
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:44,700
thing that's really cool it allows you

44
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:45,930
to stream a torrent so it basically

45
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:48,149
allows you to I think there's an example

46
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:50,729
down here somewhere right so it makes it

47
00:01:50,729 --> 00:01:52,649
basically allows you to like pass in a

48
00:01:52,649 --> 00:01:54,780
torrent or a magnet link which is just a

49
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:57,270
shortened for torrent then allows you to

50
00:01:57,270 --> 00:01:59,700
do a read stream to that torrent so a

51
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:02,729
rich Dream is basically just saying I

52
00:02:02,729 --> 00:02:05,460
want to get that data for this file this

53
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:07,890
torrent when you have it but guy kind of

54
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:09,840
try to fetch it on the man right so fits

55
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,250
this data in the torrent as quickly as

56
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:12,230
possible

57
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:14,720
so I use this thing to build a video

58
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,220
player called pure fix that yourself you

59
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:18,260
just display video and somebody use that

60
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:19,760
to build something called popcorn time

61
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,290
that I've actually to show a legal video

62
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:24,730
but that's like that's unrelated back to

63
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:26,930
back to like so what does this thing

64
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:29,629
have to do with docker well it has to do

65
00:02:29,629 --> 00:02:31,010
with the fact that I don't want to kill

66
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:32,299
someone when I pull something from the

67
00:02:32,299 --> 00:02:37,840
registry so i made this other thing a

68
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,780
color weeks back called torrent docker

69
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:44,000
which kind of combines the idea of

70
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,400
illegal videos on the internet we're not

71
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,989
killing someone when you pull the docker

72
00:02:47,989 --> 00:02:52,989
image so what it does is it it actually

73
00:02:52,989 --> 00:02:55,069
it's actually really really simple but

74
00:02:55,069 --> 00:02:56,450
it sounds really advanced so like it's

75
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:58,250
something that makes you sound a bit

76
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:01,400
arrogant but anyway so it implements a

77
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,319
union file system that's backed by bit

78
00:03:03,319 --> 00:03:05,840
torn for a readable part but like right

79
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,780
stuff to the local file system so if you

80
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:11,560
think about it this way it's like if you

81
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:15,049
you can like mount a torrent right and

82
00:03:15,049 --> 00:03:16,400
then every time you reach and that gives

83
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,910
you like a drive like to a drive right

84
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:22,069
and then every time you read something

85
00:03:22,069 --> 00:03:26,440
on that drive this happens tonight is it

86
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:34,280
local if it is local reading local is oh

87
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:39,470
is it in the torrent then we different

88
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:42,109
chart so this is basically a doujin file

89
00:03:42,109 --> 00:03:43,700
system because like it has two layers

90
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:46,130
it's a union of these two layers and

91
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:50,009
when you write something to describe it

92
00:03:50,019 --> 00:03:55,129
face it just says like right to the

93
00:03:55,129 --> 00:04:00,980
local file system right all right and

94
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:07,069
I've talked so this is fat well that's

95
00:04:07,069 --> 00:04:09,970
weird

96
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:15,070
so she's probably make this figure so

97
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:17,449
I'm just going to demo it because I

98
00:04:17,449 --> 00:04:21,490
think that's explains it there so if i

99
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:24,620
boot into log into digital ocean

100
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:26,210
instance I've running here I think it's

101
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:30,800
running in here so I'm on Max's tack on

102
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,419
it it might be I don't know how fast it

103
00:04:32,419 --> 00:04:37,520
is but alright it's fine so like this is

104
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,870
a machine that's located in Europe

105
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:48,800
across the Atlantic all right

106
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:52,230
in here I quickly made a folder it's

107
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:55,139
called one shot this machine should have

108
00:04:55,139 --> 00:05:03,830
a Duggar image ah that's a nine called

109
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:14,460
test image dogger images oops right so

110
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:16,260
that this has a program is called test

111
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:17,580
finished this machine in Europe has a

112
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:21,210
dog ranch golf test image I can daughter

113
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:28,320
run this thing and it boots up a

114
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,970
daughter container here to have stuff

115
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:34,380
like Nolan right that's cool so

116
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:37,380
what I did beforehand like 20 minutes

117
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:38,669
ago when next told me to do this thing

118
00:05:38,669 --> 00:05:42,900
was i exported this thing into a tarball

119
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:44,910
it was basically just like you can tell

120
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:47,880
dr. to say that image there can you kind

121
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,050
of create a tarball the contains the

122
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:50,820
entire file system and dump that out to

123
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:52,500
stand it out so I did that and I say

124
00:05:52,500 --> 00:06:01,350
that in the file so it's in here oh I

125
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:09,270
shouldn't get that don't you aah buh you

126
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:14,300
get the center this thing is big ride I

127
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:17,039
want to do this thing right I think you

128
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:19,710
can do the dash age all right so this is

129
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:21,660
like literary business just and a

130
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:22,860
butcher image and the only thing it

131
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:26,810
contains is node right and it's 540 mix

132
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:29,880
so I mean it's kind of a button contains

133
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,979
the entire linux distribution so

134
00:06:31,979 --> 00:06:33,930
normally if i wanted to push this thing

135
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:35,340
to registry and i hadn't pushed any of

136
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:37,590
it before I would have to push like 550

137
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:39,630
MX and even if i push some of it the way

138
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:41,160
that register works is I would kind of

139
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:44,250
had to ask for all the layers and my

140
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:46,110
took a daughter thing if it had that and

141
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:48,060
again like going cross atlantic and it

142
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:49,289
always takes like a minute for me I

143
00:06:49,289 --> 00:06:52,169
don't know what so what this was I ran

144
00:06:52,169 --> 00:06:54,360
this command called torrent or create

145
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:58,080
the test image and what does does is it

146
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,190
takes that image

147
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:02,750
index it says like basically just runs

148
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:04,849
through the tub all figured out Oh what

149
00:07:04,849 --> 00:07:06,949
files in this tub all put that in a

150
00:07:06,949 --> 00:07:09,379
level baby I'm kind of assuming people

151
00:07:09,379 --> 00:07:12,080
know what I labeled B is Jesus is that

152
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,509
level to be creates a torrent it

153
00:07:14,509 --> 00:07:16,550
contains the tab all and they label to

154
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:23,650
be and save that here here right so this

155
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:28,220
thing here this test image the torrent

156
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:30,470
is a torrent file that references these

157
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:32,750
two files alright cool so why don't you

158
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:34,099
be able to do now is that you'll be able

159
00:07:34,099 --> 00:07:38,090
to do torn Tucker feet testing this

160
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:41,479
torrent so now like my digital ocean

161
00:07:41,479 --> 00:07:46,550
instant is sitting this torrent so if i

162
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:53,300
go locally i should be able to go in

163
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:58,129
here and 0 NE to this is the wrong file

164
00:07:58,129 --> 00:08:00,530
I should first have to transfer this

165
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:08,860
torrent file to my machine oh oh

166
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:12,310
so I just need to copy paste this thing

167
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:15,260
just downloading the torrent file so

168
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:18,200
connectivity works that's cool so let's

169
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:23,720
get back to seeing this thing see

170
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:29,090
alright cool so locally I had my turn

171
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:32,860
fire so what I can do now is I can do

172
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:37,790
torrent darker food and then I can pass

173
00:08:37,790 --> 00:08:40,460
in my torrent file and I name of a

174
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:46,250
container by one shut container that's

175
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:49,610
it so this gives me like a deep boxing

176
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:55,550
here so what it's actually happening now

177
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:59,210
is hopefully my local computer will

178
00:08:59,210 --> 00:09:00,740
connect to the devotion instance it's

179
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:02,600
done that now plow to find each other

180
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:06,080
using the BitTorrent EST and it's trying

181
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,370
to put that door container it actually

182
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:08,690
took that turned and mounted it as a

183
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:11,510
file system on my machine so hopefully

184
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:13,970
like without laying a bit slow now like

185
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:15,140
hopefully in a bit it will have

186
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:21,410
downloaded the debate on index and stuff

187
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:26,810
yeah okay for it that's not good let's

188
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:38,160
try again

189
00:09:38,170 --> 00:09:41,300
2222

190
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:43,590
so what it's trying to do is it's taking

191
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:45,029
the bittorrent its mounting mounting

192
00:09:45,029 --> 00:09:46,890
that as a local file system and trying

193
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:48,420
to boot the Dark Continent set the

194
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:50,070
thought system by basically fetching any

195
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:52,140
file in the file system based on demand

196
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:56,880
using the turn over max's torn sorry tag

197
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:09,510
on it is that right so oh wait wait wait

198
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:12,420
wait no this is stupid okay I'm not

199
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:22,110
running puto daughter locally I'm just

200
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:24,000
going to put that up so I got on a Mac I

201
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,140
need to run a virtual machine to run

202
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:29,160
virtual machines inside daughter which

203
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,630
is why we love mac i guess it's so easy

204
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:39,630
to use let's see darker ok so this thing

205
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:43,240
is running out let's give it another try

206
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:47,180
whoa

207
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:51,210
yeah alright cool so now I shoot it's

208
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:53,310
happening down here right so like its

209
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:56,400
mounting the file system and its trying

210
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,780
to boot bash because that's the entry

211
00:10:57,780 --> 00:10:59,520
point of my thing so basically this

212
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:00,990
fastest was trying to figure out what

213
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:02,640
what are all the dependencies a bash so

214
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,560
it's like there's like lip info in there

215
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,510
I don't know what that is or something

216
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:10,380
cool lift Hill stuff like this is all

217
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:12,840
being yeah like this is all being

218
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,790
fetched of a bit torn from like all the

219
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:16,710
piers in the world which is just one

220
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:18,090
night now because it's my digital ocean

221
00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:21,390
instance or what makes this type on it

222
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:25,110
that's running on t-mobile so like we're

223
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:27,060
getting there apparently we're getting

224
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:28,590
back Chelsea that's probably like one of

225
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:32,790
the last ones your name right cool so we

226
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:36,690
just poured a 540 megabyte turned image

227
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:38,250
using bittorrent over like shitty

228
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:40,560
network right and like this thing is

229
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,690
totally usable I can do like LS here and

230
00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:44,970
like it has to fish LS but of course I

231
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:49,050
haven't synced that right and you can

232
00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:51,440
even like you can you can even run node

233
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,750
and it'll start it fits that so you can

234
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:55,920
see down here in the big I don't know if

235
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:56,880
you can see it but like it's trying to

236
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,200
fetch known all the dependencies which

237
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:01,200
is like lip standard C++ that's probably

238
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:07,920
cool inshare ripe and in a second it

239
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:12,150
will have that first so basically the

240
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:13,860
idea is that we just fetch what is

241
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:15,180
needed we don't need to fetch all these

242
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:16,590
five hundred forty megabytes and like

243
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:18,810
while we're running this thing like oven

244
00:12:18,810 --> 00:12:20,190
the top corner is also seeding the image

245
00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:22,200
right so if someone else tries to put my

246
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,970
machine we now have two peers if that

247
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:25,770
guy tries to run it we now have three

248
00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:28,050
piers and like you know it's spreading

249
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:30,210
like crazy right which is really really

250
00:12:30,210 --> 00:12:32,280
cool so we got note and we can run note

251
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:34,560
now so that's cool so like imagine going

252
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,110
back to the original example like a

253
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:39,450
female's dislike so we can basically do

254
00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:41,820
like that cat that could be like it

255
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:44,550
let's do it alive right

256
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:47,620
and like you could run into torn darker

257
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:52,240
here so basically you can using this

258
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,500
kind of thing you could you could have

259
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,060
like a debt that contains like a

260
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:56,800
terabyte of data typing into a sucker

261
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,110
image that's like a gigabyte but it all

262
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:00,850
put in like seconds so I think that's

263
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:05,080
pretty cool anyways that lasted talker

264
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:08,010
stuff I'm just a sub sector here right

265
00:13:08,010 --> 00:13:10,060
are you talking about replication right

266
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:11,890
right so I won't talk too much about it

267
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:14,260
but like just that so this is part of

268
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:15,910
our big replication scheme like we want

269
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:17,200
to view up the time we want to do stuff

270
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,770
like that we also in the process of

271
00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:23,620
discussing how do we actually like how

272
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:25,600
do you distribute that right get is

273
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,370
pretty cool it is pretty cool mr.

274
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:29,140
brewing like you can everybody can have

275
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:30,280
a kid and you can push to each other and

276
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:32,260
that's kind of cool so we were just I'm

277
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:33,850
just going to pre flea talk about what

278
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:35,920
we're trying to do there and kind of

279
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,180
make the scenes of subscribe to do this

280
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:40,540
thing so like we wanted to be able to do

281
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:41,830
kind of like the same sort of things

282
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:43,930
like get up doing is doing with baby

283
00:13:43,930 --> 00:13:45,400
Kiedis multimaster like you can have a

284
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,620
kid you can put stuff in my kid I can

285
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:48,790
put stuff in your kit and we can sync

286
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:50,410
and reverse resolve complex interest

287
00:13:50,410 --> 00:13:56,740
works so like basically the idea behind

288
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:59,140
you these things is that like it

289
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:00,790
everybody has a database that database

290
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:02,500
has an append only lock does anybody

291
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:03,640
know what I've been penned only log is

292
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:06,370
all right again that's one of the things

293
00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:07,630
that make you sound cool because like

294
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:08,860
when you know what it is it's like oh

295
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:10,540
it's so simple and if you don't know

296
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:13,240
what it is is regular on oh so like it's

297
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:15,340
basically just a log and apply a log I

298
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:17,770
mean just a list and you just a pimp to

299
00:14:17,770 --> 00:14:21,400
it that's the append only part you just

300
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,020
never to be from it because it makes it

301
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:26,130
really really easy to redistribute right

302
00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:28,630
so basically the idea is that if you

303
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:31,030
have something like a database every

304
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:32,500
time you do an operation on a database

305
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,240
like if it's a key value store every

306
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,710
time you delete something or insert

307
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:37,120
something you just append this to this

308
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,460
lock right so you kind of end up having

309
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:42,280
a lock like this that's like well first

310
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,750
I'm going to ensure the key is called a

311
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:45,990
copy called hello the valorous world

312
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:48,550
it's a put by the way then afterwards

313
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:50,380
someone it says like hi oakland right on

314
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:53,500
the key hi that's also good then if i

315
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,030
delete something i don't delete the

316
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:56,960
first entry here i insert a new entry

317
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:59,480
and i'd say like that's a dream so

318
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:01,370
basically if i read this entire lock and

319
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:04,580
i kind of like you know resolve every

320
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:07,160
entry from 12 to 23 i end up with

321
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:09,980
something like my my my key value store

322
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:13,100
contains like hi oakland right because i

323
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:19,880
deleted the other things so like this is

324
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:22,700
really easy it really easy to it to

325
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:24,230
replicate because if i have a lock like

326
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:26,180
that and you have a log like that and i

327
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:29,810
want i want to get your log like let's

328
00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:31,430
say this other guy has like free

329
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:38,190
interest in this walk what we do is oh

330
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:42,200
is that we just go back you're like if

331
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,240
this guy has has 3 interested in the dog

332
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,590
and I don't have anything i just thought

333
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:47,540
by selling y'all guy can you give me

334
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:49,010
everything from zero because like that's

335
00:15:49,010 --> 00:15:51,500
all i have i have 0 there guys Joe guys

336
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,540
like sure still I have like from cyril

337
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:55,400
at my head is free so like the tip from

338
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,740
0 to 3 is 1 2 3 so he sends me that

339
00:15:57,740 --> 00:16:00,050
thing let's reread a simple they like

340
00:16:00,050 --> 00:16:02,750
now i have free entries in my log there

341
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:04,070
was three entries so if i wanted to

342
00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:05,570
replicate again I what till a guy can

343
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:06,950
you get me everything from number three

344
00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:10,250
and he would send me like the tip of

345
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:11,630
that was a stag nothing because he has

346
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:14,650
free that's the head of history so

347
00:16:14,650 --> 00:16:21,410
that's really the symbol so now i have

348
00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:24,050
not now i have this all guys log and

349
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:25,850
have my own lock right so we might want

350
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:27,830
to have a situation where we want to get

351
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:29,600
every lock that have ever been

352
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,760
distributed does this is like really

353
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,470
really easy to do because what we do is

354
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:35,840
we just instead of just sending the head

355
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:38,750
of like my log of the gel guys look like

356
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:40,430
you're sending the head of DB once log i

357
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:42,260
just sent him the heads of every log i

358
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:45,440
have basically so if you have a

359
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,510
situation here where like this other guy

360
00:16:47,510 --> 00:16:49,310
has two logs he has to be one flock yes

361
00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:50,690
free entries from this guy and has to be

362
00:16:50,690 --> 00:16:52,280
to slog he has two entries from that guy

363
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:54,290
if i wanted to replicate to him i would

364
00:16:54,290 --> 00:16:56,150
just start by sending him all the heads

365
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:57,770
of my local ox which is nothing because

366
00:16:57,770 --> 00:16:59,390
I don't have anything right now it

367
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:01,760
describes a like okay so nothing but if

368
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,860
from nothing to my thing is like TB 1 2

369
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:07,040
3 and d be chewed 122 right so he sends

370
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:09,170
me like those five entries so if i

371
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:10,829
wanted to replicate with this guy again

372
00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:12,600
I would just send him the head of my

373
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,579
local arcs with us now like db1 that's

374
00:17:14,579 --> 00:17:16,079
the head of that one is free and the

375
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:18,390
head of db2 is to write so I presented

376
00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:21,059
that little information and he would

377
00:17:21,059 --> 00:17:23,100
like calculate the tip locally and the

378
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:24,600
date of that locally is nothing because

379
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:28,409
he already has DB 13 mtv2 so this is a

380
00:17:28,409 --> 00:17:30,659
really really simple like replication

381
00:17:30,659 --> 00:17:33,210
mechanism for distributed replication

382
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:37,890
locks so if nutmeg was here he would

383
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:39,149
tell you that this is called scuttlebutt

384
00:17:39,149 --> 00:17:42,950
because he wrote like most of this yet

385
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:44,850
I'm just going to steal his thunder and

386
00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:47,700
take credit for it it is really really

387
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:50,370
cool because we resemble it has like one

388
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:52,019
yeah and the cool thing about it is that

389
00:17:52,019 --> 00:17:53,220
we don't even need to be connected to

390
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:54,389
rebut in this network to can I get

391
00:17:54,389 --> 00:17:55,740
everybody's lock because we just need to

392
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:57,029
kind of have a path between everybody

393
00:17:57,029 --> 00:17:59,460
and then eventually its eventual

394
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:02,179
consistent we will get everybody's lock

395
00:18:02,179 --> 00:18:04,889
so that's really really cool that's

396
00:18:04,889 --> 00:18:06,330
kinda like you know kind of like same

397
00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:08,220
situation with get where you don't push

398
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:10,409
to everybody if i push to Max and Max

399
00:18:10,409 --> 00:18:12,059
Brooks pushes through someone else I

400
00:18:12,059 --> 00:18:13,830
notice someone else would get my changes

401
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:15,240
eventually because like I pushed them to

402
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:17,850
maximize we carries my changes low on so

403
00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:20,130
that's a really cool property it has

404
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:23,549
like one big big trade-off that might be

405
00:18:23,549 --> 00:18:25,799
okay for your use case I think sub can

406
00:18:25,799 --> 00:18:28,110
talk about that but like you might have

407
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:30,539
situation where we cannot make the

408
00:18:30,539 --> 00:18:32,039
assumption that someone needs lock

409
00:18:32,039 --> 00:18:33,720
arrive before someone else's life we

410
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:34,919
just know that eventually you will i

411
00:18:34,919 --> 00:18:37,649
will have everybody's lock right so with

412
00:18:37,649 --> 00:18:38,909
Max and serve something in this key

413
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:44,700
value store if max it serve something in

414
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:46,139
this key better store and key like a low

415
00:18:46,139 --> 00:18:53,340
right so like if max says hello it's now

416
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:57,570
world and like I say well hello it's bad

417
00:18:57,570 --> 00:18:59,299
because that's the Danish word for world

418
00:18:59,299 --> 00:19:02,279
so that's the true one and like we

419
00:19:02,279 --> 00:19:04,350
replicate it's really hard to make an

420
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:05,909
assumption here thats that's like one of

421
00:19:05,909 --> 00:19:07,350
them is going to win because there's

422
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:09,240
really no ordering between these two

423
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:11,880
blocks so how would we solve that which

424
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,169
is like a big problem we would happen

425
00:19:13,169 --> 00:19:15,389
and that because that is basically you

426
00:19:15,389 --> 00:19:16,740
can kind of follow that almost down to a

427
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:19,559
distribution at least or in this kind of

428
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:21,600
sense so we need to pick someone that

429
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:22,980
wins and we need to pick someone the

430
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:24,090
winds consistently

431
00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:25,980
me and we could just pick like max

432
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:29,669
because X is higher than T and diabetic

433
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:31,049
be that source higher but it's kind of

434
00:19:31,049 --> 00:19:33,179
like a shitty way of picking one because

435
00:19:33,179 --> 00:19:36,720
like mine is often used in better so

436
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:40,260
like how do you fix this and this

437
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:41,370
basically you fix this by doing

438
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:44,850
something called a merge right so I'm

439
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:47,580
just going to quickly show this thing

440
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:50,299
that I wrote on the plane ride over here

441
00:19:50,299 --> 00:19:52,830
and I named it yesterday because I saw

442
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:54,900
subtext talk yesterday and at four like

443
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:58,320
hyper that sounds cool so I'm calling

444
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:01,320
this thing hyper log so it's basically

445
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:04,980
just the it's very very young and new

446
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:06,539
but like I think this is going to be the

447
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:08,070
might be the foundation of that going

448
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:12,179
forward the idea is basically that if I

449
00:20:12,179 --> 00:20:15,179
go back to my log slide here that that

450
00:20:15,179 --> 00:20:17,460
that entries analog can have references

451
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:20,340
to entries in another lock right so

452
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:23,700
basically db2 here might say do i'm

453
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:31,230
totally merging like DB 12 right because

454
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:33,149
then I know if I get this entry here out

455
00:20:33,149 --> 00:20:36,149
of order I know that if I somehow

456
00:20:36,149 --> 00:20:37,919
afterwards get this entry it's like

457
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:39,419
that's entering because like this

458
00:20:39,419 --> 00:20:44,610
guy is merging it and also I know like

459
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:48,149
if this guy down here is if he is

460
00:20:48,149 --> 00:20:51,120
referencing DB one free I actually don't

461
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:53,580
need to send him this head of TV the TV

462
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:55,590
one lock because I know if I send him

463
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:58,200
the value of db2 to it gets a reference

464
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,029
to yell a lot right so it kind of makes

465
00:21:00,029 --> 00:21:02,190
the handshaking reading really simple so

466
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:03,630
I know this is advanced stuff it's like

467
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:04,919
it only makes sense to me because I've

468
00:21:04,919 --> 00:21:07,230
spent a month taking into it so I'm

469
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:08,460
trying I'm trying not to sound very

470
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:11,010
smart and make example still count old

471
00:21:11,010 --> 00:21:13,440
same old but anyways I'm just going

472
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,700
to try to do a quick them a lot of it

473
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:18,049
and then I'm gonna get off the stage oh

474
00:21:18,049 --> 00:21:20,130
we still actually probably to stop

475
00:21:20,130 --> 00:21:24,029
replicating this thing so actually a

476
00:21:24,029 --> 00:21:26,640
really cool thing about this is that it

477
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:27,809
actually works even though you're

478
00:21:27,809 --> 00:21:30,000
offline so if you I just shut off to

479
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,260
torrent but I can still boot it maybe

480
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:35,490
yeah i can so boot it because like it

481
00:21:35,490 --> 00:21:36,780
everything said oh CLE so that's a real

482
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:37,090
cool

483
00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:39,640
anyways so I can still run like most

484
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:46,020
efficient of node awesome right so

485
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:57,040
anyways the hypo lock thing if I demo so

486
00:21:57,040 --> 00:22:03,460
if I make to folder sugar so like we had

487
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:04,810
free peers in this system I should

488
00:22:04,810 --> 00:22:10,840
probably make this figure I can go in

489
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:12,970
here and i can call like I blog add a

490
00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:17,500
message like hello world like that this

491
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:19,470
would be maxed at Susilo world right and

492
00:22:19,470 --> 00:22:21,630
I should be able to print this thing out

493
00:22:21,630 --> 00:22:23,920
so like it says oh there 41 minutes in

494
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:26,100
the log into the world it has this key

495
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:29,770
if i go into like another folder let's

496
00:22:29,770 --> 00:22:31,480
assume that it is also it would be a

497
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:34,060
different machine i could run at like hi

498
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:40,390
blog at hello that if i print this thing

499
00:22:40,390 --> 00:22:46,840
out oh it says like oh this is a

500
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:48,580
little bit now so what I could do is I

501
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:49,810
could pull the changes from the other

502
00:22:49,810 --> 00:22:55,240
log into this lock so this that pulled

503
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:57,010
the changes using the algorithm I rather

504
00:22:57,010 --> 00:22:58,420
every quickly describe that nobody is

505
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:00,850
understanding and if I print this thing

506
00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:02,830
out now i will say that there are two

507
00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:06,270
two values here but if we tell it like

508
00:23:06,270 --> 00:23:09,160
print out the heads which heads means

509
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,840
that everything that said at the top of

510
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:12,340
the log it says oh there's two now

511
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:14,110
because these berries are kind of

512
00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:16,570
conflicting so what i can do is i can

513
00:23:16,570 --> 00:23:19,720
add a new one and this local demo i have

514
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:21,580
just implicitly merges these two values

515
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:23,110
into new value so i'm just gonna say

516
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:29,850
like add hello real bad Oh read real

517
00:23:29,850 --> 00:23:34,360
there we go so if i print this out now

518
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:38,350
this thing will have free values and you

519
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:40,480
can see here this links and the link is

520
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,040
kind of like a merge because the merch

521
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:43,990
is a very high level concept i think i

522
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:45,550
think is a bit lower level doesn't

523
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:48,040
matter like this links to values now and

524
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:50,320
you cannot read this but like this one

525
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:50,530
of the

526
00:23:50,530 --> 00:23:52,960
cell uses this one and yellow value is

527
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:56,470
this one so i know that if i read this

528
00:23:56,470 --> 00:23:58,390
thing and this has like a merge of these

529
00:23:58,390 --> 00:23:59,890
two things as you didn't know he's like

530
00:23:59,890 --> 00:24:01,900
wanna soon in the bottom basically

531
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:04,180
that's kind of cool and like we had the

532
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:06,070
same property as we do and get where if

533
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:09,720
i go to the other peer again and do like

534
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:12,760
print this guy out i can pull in the

535
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:21,280
changes of this all appear and like it's

536
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:22,420
still resolved right we don't get a

537
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:23,680
conflict or anything like that and it

538
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:25,890
will always for solving a nice way so

539
00:24:25,890 --> 00:24:30,040
yeah if that's that small is it so yeah

540
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:33,430
