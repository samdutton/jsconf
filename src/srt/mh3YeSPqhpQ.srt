1
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:21,300

I guess sound like there's actually some

2
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:23,700
people in the room this is good alright

3
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:27,180
so name of the talk is touch me I dare

4
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:31,230
you there are a lot of touch devices out

5
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:33,660
there in the world and this talk is

6
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:37,470
about how to work with those and more

7
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:40,050
importantly how to work with them not

8
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:41,879
just with touch but also there's a

9
00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:43,050
tremendous number devices that are out

10
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:44,489
there that are very similar to this one

11
00:00:44,489 --> 00:00:46,920
which is you know I've got the the

12
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:49,230
surface pro here and it's got a full

13
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:52,920
keyboard and it's got a mouse and I can

14
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:55,620
actually use a pin and I don't know how

15
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:57,869
many people have seen the pins they come

16
00:00:57,869 --> 00:01:00,150
with the the service pro and other

17
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:01,949
windows devices they actually have a

18
00:01:01,949 --> 00:01:04,500
radio tip on the front of them which

19
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:05,820
means that it better more than a

20
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:07,770
capacitive pin a capacitive pin is able

21
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:11,130
to be a big finger basically or slightly

22
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:14,670
more accurate finger a radio tipped pen

23
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:17,310
with the right digitizer very much like

24
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:21,150
a Wacom board is pixel perfect in its

25
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:24,479
accuracy and it has tilt and it has

26
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:26,549
pressure and it has a whole bunch of

27
00:01:26,549 --> 00:01:28,020
other things and so there's a whole

28
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:29,130
bunch of things that we can do with the

29
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:31,799
pin that we can't do with the finger but

30
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:32,969
in addition to that you know there's

31
00:01:32,969 --> 00:01:35,219
also touch devices and mice and

32
00:01:35,219 --> 00:01:38,009
keyboards and so on so that's what this

33
00:01:38,009 --> 00:01:41,280
talk is about all right so he's over to

34
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,329
gesture at this one because this one's

35
00:01:42,329 --> 00:01:44,100
actually on screen that one is actually

36
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:47,929
not on screen now so I can water bottle

37
00:01:47,929 --> 00:01:51,060
so you'll see a lot of weird as I go no

38
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:55,009
over here so my name is josh holmes and

39
00:01:55,009 --> 00:01:57,600
you find me on twitter at josh holmes

40
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,960
you find my blog at josh homes.com and

41
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,170
i'm josh dot homes at microsoft com I've

42
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:06,569
worked at Microsoft for about six and a

43
00:02:06,569 --> 00:02:09,090
half years the last three of so were in

44
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:12,900
Ireland the last three weeks have

45
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:16,080
actually been in redmond on the Internet

46
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,180
Explorer team so brand new to the

47
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:19,560
Internet Explorer team so we had at

48
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,930
least a week more of I'm new to the team

49
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:24,540
I don't know okay so when you ask me the

50
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:26,550
tough questions expect that as a

51
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:30,340
response okay all right so

52
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:32,410
why does touch matter touch matters

53
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:36,849
because of the incredible proliferation

54
00:02:36,849 --> 00:02:39,370
of touch devices that are out there in

55
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:42,220
the world and I mean it's something like

56
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:44,620
twenty five percent of all the windows 8

57
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:46,480
machines that are shipping are all touch

58
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,610
devices obviously a tremendous number

59
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:51,510
the mobile phones all the tablets

60
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:56,140
ranging from the the ipad over to the

61
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:59,319
the surface like this one even the new

62
00:02:59,319 --> 00:03:01,989
chrome books so if you look at the the

63
00:03:01,989 --> 00:03:04,360
Chromebook pixel it's a touchscreen

64
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:08,019
device so there's a tremendous number of

65
00:03:08,019 --> 00:03:09,700
touchscreen devices that are out there

66
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:13,090
that are shipping and you know so you

67
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:15,790
need to figure out how are you going to

68
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:17,590
deal with them and there's kind of three

69
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:20,530
basic strategies that you can take at an

70
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:22,959
uber level you know so the first one oh

71
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:25,420
sorry I forgot touch devices are

72
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:27,250
actually even going into weird

73
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:28,480
interesting places like I don't know how

74
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,220
many of your staying at the hotel when I

75
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:32,560
got off the elevator this morning I saw

76
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,739
this touch it says uh touch the screen

77
00:03:35,739 --> 00:03:39,069
to interact with the Amelia Island

78
00:03:39,069 --> 00:03:42,340
Plantation like cool so I touched and

79
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:44,500
sure enough there's a touch browser in

80
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:47,920
the damn hotel on the TV okay this is

81
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,780
cool I like this so what is your

82
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:52,599
strategy for dealing with touch it's

83
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:54,579
absolutely a legitimate strategy to

84
00:03:54,579 --> 00:03:56,620
ignore it if you know what you're doing

85
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:58,389
you know so if you can consciously say

86
00:03:58,389 --> 00:03:59,950
you know what I'm not going to worry

87
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:01,269
about touch it's not my target

88
00:04:01,269 --> 00:04:05,410
demographic or you know what touch you

89
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:07,690
know the mouse is simulation on touch

90
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:11,410
devices is good enough okay and and I'll

91
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:12,819
show you some examples of this here in a

92
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:15,190
little bit but mouse emulation on touch

93
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:18,310
devices is good enough in a lot of cases

94
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:20,139
actually you know I'm going to jump over

95
00:04:20,139 --> 00:04:21,549
to one of the demos now and I'll show

96
00:04:21,549 --> 00:04:25,539
you this very briefly so this this is a

97
00:04:25,539 --> 00:04:27,750
little bit of code if you've done any

98
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:31,570
Mouse work you've seen code very much

99
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:34,680
like this so I'm going to grab an event

100
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:37,660
mouseup mouse up and mouse move so all

101
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:39,520
I'm going to care about is when I click

102
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,460
and when I move the mouse right and so

103
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:43,610
I'm going to run

104
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:47,090
projects and it's this one that i'm

105
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:49,430
looking at here okay and so what this is

106
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:50,900
a little pong demo and you can see i

107
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:54,500
move my mouse and that works decently i

108
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,240
move my mouse to this side and that

109
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,280
works decently excitement excitement

110
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:01,580
right okay so I'm going to click that

111
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:07,099
and so I can go play pong badly and it's

112
00:05:07,099 --> 00:05:12,749
accommodation kind of pong and break out

113
00:05:12,759 --> 00:05:15,680
anyways so this all looks fine right

114
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,620
this is this is working so i can ignore

115
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:21,830
touch no no actually I can't and there's

116
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:23,779
a couple of reasons for that the primary

117
00:05:23,779 --> 00:05:26,509
one is your user has more than one

118
00:05:26,509 --> 00:05:29,389
finger so what happens when they want to

119
00:05:29,389 --> 00:05:31,159
move over here because that actually

120
00:05:31,159 --> 00:05:35,150
does work okay but now this one over

121
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:38,300
here doesn't anybody have a guess as to

122
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:40,490
why this one doesn't while I can move

123
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:46,279
this one over here because mouse there's

124
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:48,560
only one right so what do you do here

125
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,960
you start programming for touch and so

126
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:54,589
you start start using touch as it's

127
00:05:54,589 --> 00:05:57,379
meant to be so the two other things you

128
00:05:57,379 --> 00:06:01,039
can do here is you can retrofit you know

129
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:04,430
touch on to your application or you can

130
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:06,440
design for touch first and I'm going to

131
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,029
suggest that if you design for touch

132
00:06:08,029 --> 00:06:09,589
first you'll actually be in a much

133
00:06:09,589 --> 00:06:12,110
better position and because all the

134
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:14,150
things that you do for touch should work

135
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:16,719
for the mouse and keyboard as well so

136
00:06:16,719 --> 00:06:18,620
there's a couple of things that you have

137
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:19,759
to remember when you're designing for

138
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:22,279
touch first and foremost is hover sucks

139
00:06:22,279 --> 00:06:25,250
don't don't do it don't don't use hover

140
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:27,409
because you actually you know the thing

141
00:06:27,409 --> 00:06:29,419
with touch is it's touching you have to

142
00:06:29,419 --> 00:06:31,400
actually touch if you actually click in

143
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,729
order to get something to happen because

144
00:06:33,729 --> 00:06:36,349
this computer has no idea that my finger

145
00:06:36,349 --> 00:06:38,810
is a millimeter off the screen it just

146
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:41,300
doesn't okay someday we may have

147
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:43,430
computers that can do that but I'm

148
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:44,629
betting it's not to be built into your

149
00:06:44,629 --> 00:06:46,699
mobile phone anytime soon now there

150
00:06:46,699 --> 00:06:49,039
there's a lot of great scenarios where

151
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:51,050
browsers are compensating for this and

152
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:53,330
so on it's still not ideal don't use

153
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:56,440
hover instead use click or better

154
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,090
actually build a menu that is designed

155
00:06:58,090 --> 00:07:01,480
for touch okay obviously hopefully use

156
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,790
touch size buttons okay now the reason

157
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:05,710
for this is that the average human

158
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:09,610
finger is about 11 millimeters okay now

159
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:11,560
basketball players they're up kind of

160
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:15,340
the 19 20 millimeter range the babies

161
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:17,440
are kind of in this seven six seven

162
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,420
millimeter range but when you get to

163
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:21,670
this range you know it's it's kind of a

164
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:22,990
love it well I've got these big Moose

165
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:26,950
claws it's like 40 but anyways the so

166
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:29,500
one is obviously big touch things but

167
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,390
you also have to remember where your

168
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:33,550
users are so your users are going to be

169
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:35,860
using your device all over the place

170
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:37,180
they could be on the couch they could be

171
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:39,850
walking they could be on a bus and the

172
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:41,470
bus is kind of jiggling back and forth

173
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:46,210
you don't know where they are and so you

174
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:47,830
also have to remember that the touch

175
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:50,320
devices that there's a very large

176
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:53,410
percentage of missed taps okay where

177
00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:54,430
they're tapping somewhere else in the

178
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:57,250
screen so bigger buttons bigger landing

179
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:59,050
zones account for the fact that they may

180
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:00,820
or may not actually hit the target think

181
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:02,140
about that as you're developing your

182
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:05,650
application okay remember where your

183
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:08,440
users are touching the device so if I've

184
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:12,220
got a phone in my hand and I'm going to

185
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:15,880
touch a button on the top that on this

186
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:18,960
big ass phone is uncomfortable okay

187
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,310
touching down at the bottom actually

188
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:23,620
fairly comfortable okay same thing goes

189
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:26,200
on a slate okay on a tablet I mean

190
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:28,510
anybody pick up their slates and hold it

191
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:30,820
on the sides and where can your thumbs

192
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:34,180
reach that's comfortable okay anywhere

193
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,490
beyond that and it's not so think about

194
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:38,260
where you're putting your interactions

195
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:40,120
and so when you're thinking about your

196
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,849
interactions you should be there's a big

197
00:08:42,849 --> 00:08:44,229
stand right there you should be looking

198
00:08:44,229 --> 00:08:46,060
at kind of the very bottom and the

199
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:47,740
corners being the best possible

200
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:49,750
interaction so for example if you're

201
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:51,790
developing a game make sure that you're

202
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:53,380
putting the controllers on the outside

203
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:56,140
if you're developing a blog reader in

204
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:58,270
order or a blog right make sure that

205
00:08:58,270 --> 00:09:00,100
you're putting the controls you know to

206
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:02,740
navigate to the next and to read the

207
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:04,510
next article out on the sides and down

208
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:05,890
towards the bottom so that is more

209
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:07,360
comfortable and easier for people to

210
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,490
touch i think is that's that's not

211
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:12,279
get a counter to Mouse it's exactly the

212
00:09:12,279 --> 00:09:14,050
same as the mouse it's just that we're

213
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:15,220
used to putting all of our stuff up at

214
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:17,770
the top that's just the way that we've

215
00:09:17,770 --> 00:09:18,970
designed it because that's the way

216
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:20,950
newspapers worked and so we designed it

217
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:23,880
that way okay so think about where

218
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:27,370
you're going to be doing things and then

219
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:29,440
you're reading areas are exactly the

220
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,120
opposite okay so the things that are

221
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,980
kind of up towards the middle and and

222
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:35,290
centered those are the best reading

223
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:37,870
areas partially because nothing gets in

224
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:38,860
the way of them if you have your

225
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:40,450
controls out of the sides and down

226
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:43,720
towards the bottom okay remember that

227
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,459
there's more than one finger okay so

228
00:09:45,459 --> 00:09:47,440
this gets to the part of a part of the

229
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,910
demo there was there is more than one

230
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:52,589
finger and so we want to be able to

231
00:09:52,589 --> 00:09:56,709
scroll back and forth and and use more

232
00:09:56,709 --> 00:09:58,420
than one finger for things like pinch

233
00:09:58,420 --> 00:09:59,890
and zoom things like controlling both

234
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:01,510
sides of the screen there's a whole

235
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:02,709
bunch of different things that we can do

236
00:10:02,709 --> 00:10:04,360
there and also remember that there's

237
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:07,540
more than one type of input okay so more

238
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:08,980
than one type of input you know I

239
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:11,230
already talked about the mouse and I are

240
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:12,630
you talking about the pin a little bit

241
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:15,490
the mouse and the pin are very important

242
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:20,380
parts of the user's input so from a

243
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:21,490
technical perspective now i'll talk

244
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:23,980
about the design side a little bit how

245
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:27,640
do we actually do this okay and so the

246
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:29,079
exciting part is there's actually one

247
00:10:29,079 --> 00:10:31,600
set of events that we can catch that'll

248
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,459
actually catch all those different types

249
00:10:33,459 --> 00:10:35,800
of inputs and can handle multiple types

250
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:38,230
of inputs okay all the same time and

251
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:43,450
it's pointers okay pointers is a is w3c

252
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:45,970
pointer standard Microsoft has been

253
00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:48,700
working on this we've submitted it he's

254
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:50,470
telling I should be doing this one

255
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:52,390
here's a big grin on his face back there

256
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:56,470
so the events here actually very similar

257
00:10:56,470 --> 00:10:57,940
to what you would be comfortable with if

258
00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:00,970
you've done any Mouse work so pointer

259
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:02,680
down pointer move pointer out pointer

260
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:05,110
over pointer out and cancel okay those

261
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:06,970
are all very similar events to what you

262
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:09,610
would have for for a mouse so if you've

263
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:10,839
done anything with the mouse you're

264
00:11:10,839 --> 00:11:13,120
ready to go with pointers okay the

265
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,680
exciting part is this is a new candidate

266
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:16,779
recommendation and what this is going to

267
00:11:16,779 --> 00:11:18,970
do is capture all of our different types

268
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:21,910
of events and what we're going to get on

269
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:22,840
a

270
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:27,370
given event is we're actually going to

271
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:30,130
get the width of the touch okay are the

272
00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:32,230
width of the of the the pointer we're

273
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:34,210
gonna get the height of it we're gonna

274
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:36,250
get the pressure if it's a pin you get

275
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:38,170
the tilt if it's a pin where do you get

276
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:40,740
the rotation if it's a pen or a mouse or

277
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:43,600
touch so if I touch it this way that's

278
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,980
different than if I touch it this way

279
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:45,970
which is different than I've had touched

280
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:48,130
it this way we may want to react to that

281
00:11:48,130 --> 00:11:51,400
differently okay you get the pointer

282
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:55,510
type so was it a finger was it a and

283
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:56,650
actually I believe it just says touch

284
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:59,650
was it a pin or was it a mouse and it's

285
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:02,260
open for additional types of inputs as

286
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:05,530
we go forward the pointer ID you because

287
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:06,910
you can actually have more than one and

288
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:09,610
so we can have you know the demo I'll

289
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:11,170
show later I forget how many touch

290
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:12,100
points how many touch points to the

291
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:14,140
surface pro have five ok so I'll show

292
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:15,850
five plus a mouse and i'll see if i can

293
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:20,170
get a pin in there as well and then then

294
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:21,460
that you know the event type and so on

295
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:22,570
and so forth so there's a lot of

296
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:25,770
different things that come in with that

297
00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:27,940
alright so let's go back over here and

298
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:39,210
let's fix this demo here so first of all

299
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:43,839
it's coming out that killed there okay

300
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:45,490
we don't need that code anymore and

301
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:50,050
instead I'm going to not that that is

302
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:53,889
the comment so you're gonna block

303
00:12:53,889 --> 00:12:55,980
comment on that as well but oh well

304
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:58,449
alright so let me scroll out a little

305
00:12:58,449 --> 00:12:59,800
bit and I'll show you what I just

306
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:02,560
uncommented there so this is exactly the

307
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:05,019
same code it's just copy pasted with ms

308
00:13:05,019 --> 00:13:07,720
pointer up ms pointer up ms point or

309
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:10,300
move and ms pointer move what we're

310
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:14,379
doing here is we've got two basic blocks

311
00:13:14,379 --> 00:13:17,290
and we're setting up the MS pointer up

312
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:19,180
and Emmet swinter move for the left

313
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:21,370
overlay and for the right overlay that

314
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:23,319
way we can actually control you know to

315
00:13:23,319 --> 00:13:24,939
the two different sides the deuteron

316
00:13:24,939 --> 00:13:27,100
paddles at the same time okay and so I'm

317
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:30,459
going to save that I come back over to

318
00:13:30,459 --> 00:13:35,639
my little game and let's refresh and

319
00:13:35,639 --> 00:13:38,560
we'll pick our little block here now but

320
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:42,730
now notice as I'm touching here both of

321
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:44,350
them are working one on either side

322
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:46,149
because there's more than one type of

323
00:13:46,149 --> 00:13:52,600
touch and we'll see if we can get a one

324
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,000
little game here between the two of them

325
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,439
now what if I dropped my mouse over here

326
00:13:56,439 --> 00:13:59,230
that's cool too so I can now do mouse

327
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:01,980
and pointer all at the same time and

328
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:04,480
that's fine or if I wanted to drag the

329
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:09,160
pin in here oops boom I've now got a pin

330
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:12,459
and mouse and finger and all them of

331
00:14:12,459 --> 00:14:14,699
them will work at the same time okay

332
00:14:14,699 --> 00:14:18,129
cool I think that's pretty awesome

333
00:14:18,129 --> 00:14:22,209
alright so now this begs the question

334
00:14:22,209 --> 00:14:25,149
though what happens and come back over

335
00:14:25,149 --> 00:14:28,149
to hear so well you're a little too

336
00:14:28,149 --> 00:14:29,290
briefly go through the code here and

337
00:14:29,290 --> 00:14:37,129
then we'll then we'll take a look at the

338
00:14:37,139 --> 00:14:39,730
need a little feedback on the mic I'm my

339
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:43,329
phone is way over there so i'll take a

340
00:14:43,329 --> 00:14:44,319
look through the code a little bit and

341
00:14:44,319 --> 00:14:45,899
then we'll then we'll talk about the the

342
00:14:45,899 --> 00:14:47,860
obvious question what's the obvious

343
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:50,860
question

344
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:56,520
nobody what's that browser support very

345
00:14:56,520 --> 00:15:00,720
good all right so very similar to how

346
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:03,630
you would do with a touch events we're

347
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:05,640
going to if you've done any that with

348
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:08,550
that one on iOS we're going to iterate

349
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:10,500
through just the list of pointers here

350
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:13,440
and say for this pointer we're going to

351
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,899
you know act upon it okay it's very very

352
00:15:15,899 --> 00:15:18,750
simple to roll through you get a list of

353
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:21,410
those and you can get all the other

354
00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:24,260
items off of like the pointer type the

355
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:28,160
tilt and so on and so forth if you're on

356
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:32,700
iOS or on Android you get these events

357
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:34,980
which are very hard to read it I'm

358
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:37,080
seeing from the cheap seats there in the

359
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:40,620
back but this is touch start here at the

360
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:42,959
top and then there's also touch in touch

361
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:45,300
move and so on and so forth the thing

362
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:49,370
both of those those events is that a

363
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:52,950
they are just touched they're not touch

364
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:55,880
and mouse and pen and everything else

365
00:15:55,880 --> 00:16:00,240
second of all those are not a standard

366
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,700
they're not a w3c standard and are not

367
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:05,399
likely to become one because there are

368
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:07,709
multiple patents on the implementations

369
00:16:07,709 --> 00:16:09,899
of touch start and touch end that are

370
00:16:09,899 --> 00:16:11,339
not going to be licensed out to the

371
00:16:11,339 --> 00:16:13,380
other browsers so there's there's some

372
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:16,110
issues with those which is why we

373
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:19,440
recommend staying away from those the

374
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,420
are not not recommend staying away it's

375
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:24,000
a don't use those as your only and we're

376
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,320
not going to be looking at those in

377
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:28,529
internet explorer but it's touch starts

378
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:31,620
and then we also have to add the mouse

379
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:34,610
here because we're doing both okay

380
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:37,170
because the mouse and touch we don't

381
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:39,180
want to just react to one of the other

382
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:41,970
now does anybody spot the flaw in this

383
00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:47,820
code here besides if you read it so at

384
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:50,010
the beginning it says if all in touch

385
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:51,870
starts in elements sorry

386
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:54,120
document.documentelement so if we're

387
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:58,770
able to do touch my button event handler

388
00:16:58,770 --> 00:17:00,870
sorry did add add event handler touch

389
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:04,199
Starks blah blah blah else add the

390
00:17:04,199 --> 00:17:08,909
14 click for mouse can't do both at the

391
00:17:08,909 --> 00:17:12,059
same time which means that a device like

392
00:17:12,059 --> 00:17:14,069
this is very very frustrating as i get

393
00:17:14,069 --> 00:17:16,189
to your websites and i have seen this in

394
00:17:16,189 --> 00:17:18,659
probably three or four dozen websites as

395
00:17:18,659 --> 00:17:21,029
i've been researching this this talk

396
00:17:21,029 --> 00:17:23,880
over the past week i get to the website

397
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,529
and i can't use the mouse anymore

398
00:17:25,529 --> 00:17:27,899
because it detects that i have a touch

399
00:17:27,899 --> 00:17:34,529
screen and freaks out whoops okay so so

400
00:17:34,529 --> 00:17:37,260
don't do that so instead what we're

401
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:39,690
going to do is and I'm going to blow

402
00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:42,360
this code up if i can and i zoom in a

403
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:46,830
little bit on this two hundred percent

404
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:53,789
and see now that is unworkable so I'll

405
00:17:53,789 --> 00:17:55,500
just walk you through it sorry about

406
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,659
that the resolution on the screen is

407
00:17:57,659 --> 00:18:01,590
crazy so what we've got is we've got a

408
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:05,490
if ms pointer enabled so are we able to

409
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:09,769
do the pointer events if so add those

410
00:18:09,769 --> 00:18:12,750
otherwise we're going to add the touch

411
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:14,490
starts and the click and so on and so

412
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:16,649
forth okay so we're going to do a fall

413
00:18:16,649 --> 00:18:18,659
back but I'm actually going to tell you

414
00:18:18,659 --> 00:18:21,480
don't do that instead use one of the

415
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,669
polyfills for pointers okay so this gets

416
00:18:23,669 --> 00:18:25,110
to the browsers support question which

417
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:29,490
is hand j s polymer pointer events and

418
00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:33,630
points jas are all decent fallbacks

419
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:38,940
decent polyfills 444 pointer events a

420
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:40,710
hand j s is the one that i've used the

421
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:42,600
most at the moment that doesn't mean

422
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:43,710
it's the best one it just means that

423
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:44,880
it's the one that i've used the most of

424
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:48,090
the moment so let me come back over here

425
00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:51,539
to this code and let me show you first

426
00:18:51,539 --> 00:18:53,460
of all what happens in chrome at the

427
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:56,039
moment so we bring them to bring this up

428
00:18:56,039 --> 00:19:03,809
in chrome let's go to our bricks and we

429
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:06,630
click and we try to touch and right now

430
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:08,279
it doesn't understand what pointers are

431
00:19:08,279 --> 00:19:11,610
so no alright so so you've seen that it

432
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:13,139
doesn't work in chrome so let's go

433
00:19:13,139 --> 00:19:16,190
polyfill that what i'm going to do is

434
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:18,570
now

435
00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:24,040
oops and so we're going to uncomment

436
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:33,010
that and we're going to do the exact

437
00:19:33,010 --> 00:19:37,090
same come on out the buttons are just

438
00:19:37,090 --> 00:19:38,410
slightly different places than what I'm

439
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:43,150
used to hear i'm realizing i

440
00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:49,990
accidentally deleted that paste so now

441
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:52,270
what we're going to do is instead of ms

442
00:19:52,270 --> 00:20:06,980
pointer we're just going to do that

443
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:13,590
move copy paste all right so now we've

444
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:16,020
done we've added that support in but I

445
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:21,240
also need to go ad in hand is to my HTML

446
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:27,990
file comment uncommon to that and so now

447
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:30,750
so you see the reference here to hand

448
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:34,860
Jess and here is the little bit of code

449
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:37,380
so if we have MS pointer support great

450
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:39,600
let's use that otherwise we're going to

451
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:42,420
polyfill the other browsers to to give

452
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:45,120
them the amount support as well sorry

453
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,100
the pointer support so now I come back

454
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:53,340
over here to Chrome Oh again buttons are

455
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:54,990
in the rug different place here so we're

456
00:20:54,990 --> 00:20:57,480
going to refresh that now and now we

457
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:02,790
should get so here is with pointer

458
00:21:02,790 --> 00:21:11,200
support in chrome rock and roll oh cool

459
00:21:11,210 --> 00:21:14,940
Multi multi touch support is that easy

460
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:18,660
okay all we did here is come back over

461
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:21,559
to this we're using pointer events and

462
00:21:21,559 --> 00:21:23,190
pointer events are going to be a

463
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:26,790
catch-all for Mouse touch multi-touch as

464
00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:30,210
well as your pins of pork and that type

465
00:21:30,210 --> 00:21:32,580
of thing and han jae s is going to give

466
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:35,010
us a decent polyfill backwards to other

467
00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:38,760
browsers there is actually a lot of

468
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:41,100
movement on this particular spec it

469
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:45,150
moved from a you know we submitted the

470
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:48,720
spec on sep tember of last year and in

471
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,250
May it became a candidate recommendation

472
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:52,260
like setting land speed records to get

473
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:54,420
to candidate recommendation point

474
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:56,400
because the industry sees that this is a

475
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,770
need this is a problem if you were

476
00:21:58,770 --> 00:22:00,300
watching any of the google i/o stuff

477
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:02,660
last week Boris got up and talked about

478
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:04,530
pointers and what a great thing that

479
00:22:04,530 --> 00:22:05,370
they are they are going to be

480
00:22:05,370 --> 00:22:07,470
implementing them in chrome there is a

481
00:22:07,470 --> 00:22:10,190
sample implementation for chromium

482
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:12,090
firefox has stepped up and said that

483
00:22:12,090 --> 00:22:13,980
they're going to be implementing it no

484
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:16,830
word from other camps believe that as it

485
00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:20,280
is and so anyway

486
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:23,100
so that is the the meat of what I wanted

487
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:28,320
to talk about here with the pointer

488
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:41,030
events questions on any of that yes

489
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:46,740
is ie going to are we going to remove

490
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:50,160
the prefixes in the next version I can't

491
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,890
speak to future roadmap and also three

492
00:22:52,890 --> 00:22:54,600
weeks on the team I don't know that to

493
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:57,780
be honest but I mean I would assume

494
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:59,190
whether that's going to be coming at

495
00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:01,440
some points because I mean where you are

496
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,000
going to implement the spec as the spec

497
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,970
is reads and the spec reads as the

498
00:23:05,970 --> 00:23:09,270
polyfill reads which is right here with

499
00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:24,989
the pointers so okay other questions yes

500
00:23:24,999 --> 00:23:29,829
right so so the question was could I

501
00:23:29,829 --> 00:23:31,719
actually remove the MS pointer bit at

502
00:23:31,719 --> 00:23:34,179
the top and the answer is yes I could

503
00:23:34,179 --> 00:23:36,789
remove that and it would work the

504
00:23:36,789 --> 00:23:38,169
problem there that you would run into

505
00:23:38,169 --> 00:23:41,109
there is performance okay because the

506
00:23:41,109 --> 00:23:42,369
image pointers are actually even been

507
00:23:42,369 --> 00:23:44,469
implemented natively on the browser and

508
00:23:44,469 --> 00:23:46,869
are incredibly performance and the

509
00:23:46,869 --> 00:23:50,169
others of polyfill make sense okay but

510
00:23:50,169 --> 00:23:52,989
you could do that if you if it's not a

511
00:23:52,989 --> 00:24:11,500
performance issue for you yes

512
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:14,750
yes so in the event you'll actually get

513
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:17,890
that so let me go back over here to the

514
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:24,020
slides so on the event object you

515
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:25,910
actually get all of this information and

516
00:24:25,910 --> 00:24:28,700
more okay so one of them is the pointer

517
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:30,830
type and that will tell you is it a pin

518
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:33,380
is it a mouse is it as the touch what

519
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:35,420
kind of pointer is it and you'll you'll

520
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:44,120
be able to react to that differently yes

521
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:46,460
there there are constants for those yeah

522
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:49,430
and I I forget I think they're just one

523
00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:52,930
two three four five type of a thing so

524
00:24:52,930 --> 00:25:03,060
yep yes

525
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:06,850
okay so browser support for pressure

526
00:25:06,850 --> 00:25:12,990
tilts and hoes the other 10 touch radius

527
00:25:12,990 --> 00:25:18,700
so the MS pointer events they they will

528
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:22,059
give you tilts and pressure off of a pin

529
00:25:22,059 --> 00:25:23,980
they don't give you that off a touch

530
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:26,200
because the touch screens are not they

531
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:29,769
don't quite understand that yet the but

532
00:25:29,769 --> 00:25:30,820
they do well they will give you that off

533
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:34,299
of a pin I and that as part of the spec

534
00:25:34,299 --> 00:25:36,460
and so the other browsers should be

535
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:37,539
coming on board with that at some point

536
00:25:37,539 --> 00:25:39,159
in time but it'll be depended upon

537
00:25:39,159 --> 00:25:41,279
devices that actually support the pen

538
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:46,750
okay all right with that I think oh no I

539
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:48,850
still have three more minutes yay so you

540
00:25:48,850 --> 00:25:50,860
want to see one more cool thing alright

541
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:53,799
so one other thing and this is this is

542
00:25:53,799 --> 00:25:56,740
actually a one more little vendor prefix

543
00:25:56,740 --> 00:25:58,450
thing unfortunately but we're getting

544
00:25:58,450 --> 00:26:02,980
there so there is ms scroll and there's

545
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:05,500
snap points and snap type and then

546
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:06,940
there's content zooming so i'm going to

547
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:08,830
go over to a couple of demos here and

548
00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:11,259
show you both of these real quickly so

549
00:26:11,259 --> 00:26:12,879
let me go back here to Internet Explorer

550
00:26:12,879 --> 00:26:18,970
and let's do the carousel first so this

551
00:26:18,970 --> 00:26:21,399
is the traditional scroll so I've got a

552
00:26:21,399 --> 00:26:25,120
oh sorry I need to point at this one I

553
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:27,370
have a list of images here at the top

554
00:26:27,370 --> 00:26:30,419
and they're just in a list box and we've

555
00:26:30,419 --> 00:26:32,559
you know so you can see there we're

556
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:35,049
moving and I can move this way and that

557
00:26:35,049 --> 00:26:37,120
you know you see the momentum and you

558
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,679
know but notice where it stops and stuff

559
00:26:38,679 --> 00:26:41,649
okay as it's doing that so then the

560
00:26:41,649 --> 00:26:42,820
other question the other thing i can do

561
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:47,649
is i can use a this is a jquery touched

562
00:26:47,649 --> 00:26:50,730
carousel okay and so I just touch it and

563
00:26:50,730 --> 00:26:53,230
it's going to slide to the next one okay

564
00:26:53,230 --> 00:26:55,690
but watch watch my fingers I move and

565
00:26:55,690 --> 00:27:02,049
then I release see how that feels ok now

566
00:27:02,049 --> 00:27:05,080
this works right it works but it's not

567
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:08,230
great I don't really out love it okay so

568
00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:10,840
instead what I'm going to do is I'm

569
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:11,740
going to come down here to the bottom

570
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:14,190
one and this bottom one is using the

571
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:16,269
prefixes that I just talked about here

572
00:27:16,269 --> 00:27:16,870
the

573
00:27:16,870 --> 00:27:20,080
the emesis scrolls snap and snap points

574
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:22,840
and so now notice it's right underneath

575
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:27,290
my finger and if I release right there

576
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:33,130
in that nice i like that a lot ok so

577
00:27:33,130 --> 00:27:34,540
that was that's one of them that I that

578
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:35,860
I've been playing with recently and I

579
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:38,290
really really like that one the other

580
00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:44,780
one that i want to show you yes

581
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:47,520
currently it's that that's an IE thing

582
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:55,000
okay as far as i know i don't know for

583
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,990
sure I don't know alright so here is the

584
00:27:58,990 --> 00:28:00,540
other thing that's so this is the

585
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:05,500
content zoom and so ms content zooming

586
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:07,179
and so we're just going to put that on a

587
00:28:07,179 --> 00:28:10,480
particular div or something like that so

588
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,640
now right right now if I grab the

589
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,110
picture and I'm going to zoom notice

590
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:18,460
that zooms the entire page that's not

591
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:20,230
fun right so I'm going to turn that off

592
00:28:20,230 --> 00:28:22,210
I'm sorry maternal in the content zoom

593
00:28:22,210 --> 00:28:27,250
bit and so now notice is just growing

594
00:28:27,250 --> 00:28:32,110
the picture that's cool huh yeah so I

595
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:39,700
like that one as well what's that so no

596
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:42,100
it's oops sorry let me go back to their

597
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:45,730
so it's actually just it's actually set

598
00:28:45,730 --> 00:28:47,860
a zoom level as well and so I can only

599
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:49,840
zoom to a certain point but that's as

600
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,760
far as it'll zoom to right there but all

601
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,380
that's within inside of the div right

602
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:57,700
there and it's fine okay all right now

603
00:28:57,700 --> 00:29:01,450
if I close that now go back to here now

604
00:29:01,450 --> 00:29:04,690
I can resume you know that way so all

605
00:29:04,690 --> 00:29:10,720
right so I've done that wrap up a lot of

606
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:11,890
the stuff that I've talked about is

607
00:29:11,890 --> 00:29:15,030
talked about at the again this one

608
00:29:15,030 --> 00:29:17,980
docstoc web platform org slash pointer

609
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:22,210
events as well as modern-day e the other

610
00:29:22,210 --> 00:29:24,010
thing with modern data is that modern IE

611
00:29:24,010 --> 00:29:25,960
is a site where you can go up you plug

612
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:27,640
in your website and it'll actually scan

613
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:30,150
and look for a lot of common issue

614
00:29:30,150 --> 00:29:32,310
across a lot of different websites so

615
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:34,290
for example I showed a guy this morning

616
00:29:34,290 --> 00:29:36,960
and it turned out that he was using a

617
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,790
lot of vendor prefixes in his CSS and

618
00:29:38,790 --> 00:29:41,790
was missing the upper ones as well as

619
00:29:41,790 --> 00:29:45,480
the dash ms ones so it's going to look

620
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:47,010
for those kind of things it's going to

621
00:29:47,010 --> 00:29:48,780
look for responsive web design are you

622
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:51,480
enabled for touch so on and so forth and

623
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:54,060
then Doc's that web platform dot org is

624
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:56,010
a place where we at Microsoft have been

625
00:29:56,010 --> 00:29:58,230
contributing a lot of docs and working

626
00:29:58,230 --> 00:29:59,490
with a lot of other people to make sure

627
00:29:59,490 --> 00:30:01,920
those docs their docs are up to snuff

628
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:04,590
across all the browsers and so we've

629
00:30:04,590 --> 00:30:06,240
been talking about the pointer events

630
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,340
and then of course go look at the w3c

631
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:09,750
and see what they're doing with pointer

632
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:12,450
events and you can always find me at

633
