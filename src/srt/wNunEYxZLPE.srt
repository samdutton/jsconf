1
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:10,370

so this is kind of an impromptu talk

2
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:13,059
that I decided needed to happen because

3
00:00:13,059 --> 00:00:17,240
I see really inaccessible stuff on the

4
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:20,330
web all the time and just this last week

5
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:22,970
I saw a website that was very popular

6
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:26,810
and I decided that because it was

7
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:29,510
popular but it was inaccessible it was

8
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:31,700
worth talking about it a little more so

9
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:33,079
I'm going to talk about keyboard

10
00:00:33,079 --> 00:00:36,499
accessibility and I'm Marcy Sutton I'm a

11
00:00:36,499 --> 00:00:38,510
developer at substantial in Seattle

12
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:41,749
which is a 60 ish person product

13
00:00:41,749 --> 00:00:43,999
development studio and i build websites

14
00:00:43,999 --> 00:00:46,640
and mobile apps there it's not really an

15
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,670
accessibility shop but I add

16
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:50,690
accessibility to all of my projects

17
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:55,129
whenever I can so out of any of us have

18
00:00:55,129 --> 00:00:57,890
any of us broken an arm before have you

19
00:00:57,890 --> 00:01:01,789
ever broken your arm have you ever run

20
00:01:01,789 --> 00:01:04,460
out of batteries in your mouse and had

21
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:09,740
to use your keyboard all right so you

22
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:11,689
have a reason may be that you can't use

23
00:01:11,689 --> 00:01:13,850
a mouse what about if your vision

24
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:16,850
impaired or blind I mean you guys are

25
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:19,159
looking around the room doesn't seem

26
00:01:19,159 --> 00:01:20,810
likely but maybe you know somebody that

27
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:24,079
is all of a sudden you find that you

28
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:26,450
can't use the mouse and it really sucks

29
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:29,439
when somebody hasn't taken the time to

30
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:32,270
enable the keyboard it doesn't have to

31
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:34,100
be that way either we can make things

32
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:35,869
accessible with a little bit of effort

33
00:01:35,869 --> 00:01:38,840
so because this is an impromptu you talk

34
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,570
I'm just going to do some demos and we

35
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:44,689
can see what happens so the first demo I

36
00:01:44,689 --> 00:01:48,409
want to do is of whitehouse gov it's

37
00:01:48,409 --> 00:01:51,649
actually it has some alternative text in

38
00:01:51,649 --> 00:01:53,780
it it's not the worse for accessibility

39
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:57,409
but for keyboards it's pretty awful when

40
00:01:57,409 --> 00:02:00,380
I first looked at the site I was using a

41
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:02,270
mouse so I could go around the website

42
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:06,859
and see these big hover menus but if I

43
00:02:06,859 --> 00:02:10,099
start tabbing through the website I get

44
00:02:10,099 --> 00:02:12,530
a dotted outline around the logo and

45
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:14,360
some visual feedback but not

46
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:18,140
much and then I get lost I don't know

47
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:20,900
where I am I can look down at the status

48
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:22,850
bar and see that the URL is changing but

49
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:26,690
I have no visual feedback if I go back

50
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:29,540
into the menu where am I I don't even

51
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:33,590
know where I am video I happen to know

52
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:37,040
that the video link is in the photos and

53
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:41,120
video tab of the hover menu all they had

54
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,130
to do was enable this menu from the

55
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:45,890
keyboard it might have taken some CSS or

56
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:48,230
it would definitely be some CSS it might

57
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:49,730
have taken a little bit of JavaScript

58
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:51,770
but it's really not rocket science to

59
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:54,800
make this work with the keyboard that's

60
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,860
one pretty simple example that there's

61
00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:00,800
no reason for it like you can make that

62
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,970
work a lot better so I mentioned a

63
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:06,470
website that people have been talking

64
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:09,530
about a lot that they were all oh wow

65
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:11,390
look at how they stream lines that work

66
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:13,870
the workflow to buy a plane ticket

67
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:17,570
compared to united com it's you know so

68
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:19,549
many screens less to make it through

69
00:03:19,549 --> 00:03:22,730
this workflow but the website is not

70
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:25,970
accessible it's pretty bad so it's

71
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:28,700
virgin america it's their beta website I

72
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:30,590
get that it's a beta site I don't want

73
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:32,360
to be too harsh on them because I know

74
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,040
that things are a work in progress but

75
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:37,459
given all of the Polish and the yay we

76
00:03:37,459 --> 00:03:39,200
made it more fun to navigate but then

77
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,390
the blatant disregard for a keyword or

78
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:43,820
screen reader is really unfortunate so

79
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:45,970
when I first looked at the site I

80
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:48,519
started tabbing around the page and

81
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:51,500
again I see the status bar changing at

82
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,780
the bottom but I have no visual feedback

83
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:56,959
I have no idea what's going on here if I

84
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:00,980
hover I get some feedback but nothing if

85
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:03,940
you want to use a keyboard at all and so

86
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:07,820
it's really a bummer when I test a

87
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:09,950
website like this I have a couple

88
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:16,280
different tools see can we hear that i

89
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:18,380
turn on voiceover on my Mac just by

90
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:20,420
hitting command f5

91
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:22,820
Fiona laying inside of a list to click

92
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:25,640
this link press control option space so

93
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,200
i can test it with a screen reader to

94
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,300
see what does what would a blind person

95
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:34,570
yet so I'm gonna reload the page loaded

96
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:38,150
so I can see some visual feedback but if

97
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:40,760
I'm really using voiceover inside an

98
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:43,370
HTML content if I'm using voiceover it

99
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:45,710
doesn't matter if I can see it um so I'm

100
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:48,350
just gonna start tabbing like Virgin

101
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:50,780
America okay they put some text there

102
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:52,430
even though it's like an image logo

103
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:56,030
that's good like 0 items okay so i've

104
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:58,040
got some text I'm gonna keep tabbing

105
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:02,930
link link link link link link flight

106
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:06,950
alerts link Oh God elevate link sign in

107
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:12,020
link sign up link San Francisco okay

108
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,640
hold on there were there were buttons

109
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,500
there there were these radio buttons

110
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:19,040
right inside an HTML content where how

111
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:21,290
am I can't get to those control options

112
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:24,710
space if I click one of those buttons it

113
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:27,230
actually you can use the mouse but you

114
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:32,150
can't use the keyboard no you can't like

115
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:34,100
nothing on here can receive focus it's a

116
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:39,860
real bummer trip ah so when I use the

117
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:41,900
mouse to get the focus there then all of

118
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:43,700
a sudden I can get to it but who's gonna

119
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:46,010
do that the only text element inside of

120
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:50,120
a list multi-city San Francisco linked

121
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:54,800
list six items Boston MA boss link so

122
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,300
sometimes the way supper read things out

123
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:59,810
a little funny but we we can see what

124
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:01,940
they made inside the list to click this

125
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:04,010
link press control option in space

126
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:06,830
actions menu two items yep I'm a

127
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:08,480
voiceover a newbie I don't use it all

128
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:13,880
the time so you can use voiceover on

129
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:17,020
your mac on your iPhone you can also

130
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:20,240
install virtualbox on a mac and then you

131
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,520
have access to Internet Explorer which

132
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:25,520
you can use jaws which is a the most

133
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,290
widely used screen reader you can

134
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:30,320
actually get a demo version that's free

135
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:32,060
of Jaws I didn't know that until

136
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:34,310
recently it's a really good testing

137
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:36,470
tool you can use it for 40 minutes at a

138
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:39,890
time unrestricted and it's really good

139
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:41,900
way to test the most widely used screen

140
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:44,530
reader you can also get firefox

141
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:46,970
obviously on any platform but you can

142
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:51,590
get NVDA for free on for windows which

143
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:53,780
you can use through virtual box those

144
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:55,250
are a few the tools that I use to test

145
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:57,590
these things but as far as keyboard

146
00:06:57,590 --> 00:07:01,010
access goes with the Virgin America site

147
00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:03,230
I just started tabbing through it and I

148
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:05,750
could see that it had a blatant

149
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:08,960
disregard for focus styles and taba

150
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:12,050
below elements so being a curious

151
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:15,770
developer I open the dev tools just to

152
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:18,920
see what what kind of code did they use

153
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,990
here so if I go back to the home page

154
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:30,080
here it is an angular app lovely which

155
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,880
out you know on its own it's not

156
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,500
angular's fault that it's inaccessible

157
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,950
it's just really unfortunate that they

158
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:39,530
didn't make things work from the

159
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:41,720
keyboard so some of these items that

160
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:44,060
that I couldn't focus on I want to see

161
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:47,090
what those are made of so there's

162
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:49,910
actually an anchor in here it's maybe

163
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:52,580
not the most semantic element for it to

164
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:54,950
be an anchor if it has an empty href

165
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:57,080
value but I'll grant them it at least it

166
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:00,050
has text in it but since I can't tab on

167
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:03,320
to the thing it's a real bummer actually

168
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:05,270
I think you can tab on to it you just

169
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:06,980
don't get any visual feedback so you

170
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:10,250
don't know which element you're on which

171
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:12,620
there's actually you could argue that

172
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:14,810
screen reader usage is a smaller number

173
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:17,780
of your overall audience but keyboard

174
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:20,090
usage is huge and I think the only

175
00:08:20,090 --> 00:08:21,620
reason that we don't do it more is

176
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:24,080
because the experience sucks and we can

177
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:28,130
give up so we do so for the Virgin

178
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:30,380
America website all they really had to

179
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:34,100
do was define the focus style along with

180
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:35,810
the hover style and they didn't do that

181
00:08:35,810 --> 00:08:41,180
and it's super easy to do so you can

182
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:42,800
easily find the stuff out just by

183
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,870
opening the dev tools and tabbing

184
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:46,520
through a web page and see what kind of

185
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:47,020
expiry

186
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:51,130
it's you get so I'm going to go back to

187
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:54,100
my little slides here so that's a bummer

188
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:55,720
right people are launching these

189
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,460
beautiful sites they get all this

190
00:08:57,460 --> 00:08:59,770
fanfare like woohoo it's a shorter

191
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:02,620
workflow to buying a plane ticket unless

192
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:04,660
you're on a keyboard or screen reader

193
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:07,660
and that's a huge bummer but there are

194
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:09,540
some websites that do it a little better

195
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:13,000
nothing's perfect but one that I like a

196
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,190
lot and I'll admit I'm a little biased

197
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:18,910
because I worked on it but targets

198
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:21,130
corporate website everything that they

199
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:24,610
build has to be accessible and so this

200
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:27,370
was a really fun project to get to take

201
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:29,320
a beautiful brand and make something

202
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:33,070
really interactive and accessible so for

203
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:36,370
this site there were some really key

204
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:38,620
features i wanted to add including skip

205
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:40,990
links so i can jump two major parts of

206
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:43,960
it so for this we have three skip links

207
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:46,720
i'm going to go to the main navigation

208
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:50,200
and i can skip right bye unlike the

209
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,240
white house website where we tab down on

210
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,950
the main nav items and we were forced

211
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:55,990
through all of those off-screen links in

212
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:59,140
this case i skip right on by even though

213
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:01,900
if i hit enter it expands and it shows

214
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:05,440
me more items and then i can tab in so

215
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,840
from a key keyboard or screen reader

216
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:11,620
experience i am basically creating a one

217
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:14,110
to one whether you're using the mouse or

218
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:16,690
the keyboard so if i have the mouse i

219
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:18,880
can hover over and that if i want to pin

220
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:22,690
it then it works on a tablet it works on

221
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:27,430
a desktop with a keyboard or a mouse and

222
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:29,980
i even wired up the Escape key which is

223
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:32,020
really awesome so that any time you're

224
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:34,750
you have something open you can just hit

225
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:38,320
escape and get out of it so if i go back

226
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,380
to our skip links now I'm jump down into

227
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:43,000
the content and I can start tabbing

228
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,850
around and these tiles were really cool

229
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:48,190
too because I can tab on to them hit

230
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:50,500
enter it flips onto the back side and

231
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:53,440
then I can go to this link otherwise if

232
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:57,370
that was off screen because the tile

233
00:10:57,370 --> 00:10:59,950
isn't flipped yet I don't want to be

234
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:00,610
forced

235
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:02,230
onto some link that I can't see because

236
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:04,060
then I have no idea what it goes to in

237
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:08,620
this case I can flip the tile then I get

238
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:10,420
to the back side of it and if it has a

239
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:13,060
link then I can go to it so that's

240
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:17,740
pretty cool so I can go to that link so

241
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:19,510
this this website was a really good

242
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:23,470
opportunity to keep the design appeal up

243
00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:27,430
and not have to compromise too much for

244
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:30,040
the sake of accessibility and I think we

245
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:33,670
can we can create really interesting UI

246
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:35,230
patterns and not have to sacrifice

247
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:42,370
access so one other example that I've

248
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:44,860
been working on recently and this is a

249
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:46,510
really fun app to work on it's called

250
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:48,730
distiller and it's actually a whiskey

251
00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:51,010
recommendation engine and when I got

252
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:53,980
onto this project it's not that it

253
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:56,019
wasn't supposed to be accessible or that

254
00:11:56,019 --> 00:11:58,300
people didn't want it to be it's that

255
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,860
they just didn't know any better and I

256
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:01,300
think that's the case for a lot of

257
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:03,519
websites is that we tend to develop for

258
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:05,949
ourselves and we don't really remember

259
00:12:05,949 --> 00:12:08,860
that there's people who can't see or

260
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:11,440
can't use a mouse so for the whiskey

261
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,470
site distiller I really wanted to make

262
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:16,779
it accessible because how cool is it to

263
00:12:16,779 --> 00:12:19,690
go and have a shelf of your own your

264
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:22,060
favorite whiskey's online I think that's

265
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:24,310
pretty cool and I have blind friends who

266
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:26,350
think that's pretty cool we have a

267
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:28,269
feature we'd love to add I don't know

268
00:12:28,269 --> 00:12:29,800
logistically how or when this will

269
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,839
happen but getting whiskey delivered to

270
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:33,339
your house would be pretty fantastic

271
00:12:33,339 --> 00:12:35,709
especially if you are blind and you

272
00:12:35,709 --> 00:12:37,990
can't go to the store like heck yeah I

273
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:39,490
think a lot of people could see the

274
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:42,579
appeal of that so for distiller we

275
00:12:42,579 --> 00:12:45,310
actually added a feature where you can

276
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:47,649
reorder the bottles on your top shelf

277
00:12:47,649 --> 00:12:50,769
and it's a drag and drop feature I'm

278
00:12:50,769 --> 00:12:52,390
actually going to open the version of it

279
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:54,730
on my machine because i don't think it's

280
00:12:54,730 --> 00:13:04,420
been deployed yet

281
00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:08,370
so when I started working on this oh and

282
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:11,190
my my localhost content is not whiskey

283
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:16,440
really um but this had a mouse only drag

284
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,390
and drop feature and I thought it would

285
00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:19,860
be really important to make that

286
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:21,990
accessible I asked around a few friends

287
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:25,080
and making drag-and-drop accessible is a

288
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:27,270
non-trivial task I actually don't even

289
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:29,820
know how you would do that so I just

290
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:32,520
kind of reused some of the same

291
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,440
functionality but enabled it with the

292
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:37,020
keyboard so in this case I added some

293
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:39,240
skip links which we have in the top left

294
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,830
corner I think those are the ones that

295
00:13:40,830 --> 00:13:43,590
haven't been deployed yet but it's jumps

296
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:46,290
you into the content I want to jump you

297
00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:48,240
farther into the content because I still

298
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,010
have these links on the left side that I

299
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:52,230
need to tab through but these were not

300
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:54,570
accessible at all before like I think

301
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:57,390
you could tab on to them but they didn't

302
00:13:57,390 --> 00:14:00,510
have any visual feedback so you had no

303
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:04,800
idea where you were so now I have a list

304
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,590
of three bottles on my top shelf and if

305
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:10,170
I want to reorder them the way that I

306
00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:11,580
would do it before is I would click this

307
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:13,950
button that says reorder bottles and I

308
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:18,330
get a little draggable icon like a in

309
00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:20,040
this case we're using the hamburger icon

310
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:22,530
to tell you that you can move it and

311
00:14:22,530 --> 00:14:24,840
we're using a little jquery sortable

312
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:28,950
plugin every time that you drag

313
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:31,080
something on your list it actually rips

314
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:33,180
out the dom and then replaces it and so

315
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:35,460
your focus is lost that's something that

316
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:37,380
I'm doing a lot of research on with

317
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:40,230
JavaScript MVC's right now because this

318
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:42,120
is a pretty widespread problem it's not

319
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:44,820
unique to this website I think the

320
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:47,340
Virgin America angular site probably had

321
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:49,620
similar problems I didn't even have to

322
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:51,720
dive in that far to find problems but

323
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:54,720
when in this case something that we'd

324
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,240
implemented it needed help and that's

325
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,920
okay it's something that we can improve

326
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:03,600
so for this I made it so you can tab on

327
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,100
to the button which was a big

328
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:07,890
improvement and you can hit enter on it

329
00:15:07,890 --> 00:15:09,840
and because it was ripping the button

330
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:12,720
out to you would lose focus so it now it

331
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:13,900
sends you back onto the

332
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:17,110
and I can toggle it to turn this edit

333
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:19,990
mode on and off so now I can tab on the

334
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:22,900
list and I actually get feedback that

335
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:25,030
tells me which item I'm on and it makes

336
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:28,000
it actually usable so if I use the arrow

337
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,350
keys I can reorder it and in a screen

338
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:35,920
reader voiceover on Chrome profile

339
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:38,200
vertical line to steal our window bottle

340
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,850
two of three Bushmills 21 year old use

341
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:41,740
arrows to reorder button as keyboard

342
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:44,500
focus so i added links or text up screen

343
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:47,050
to tell you where it is bottle one of

344
00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:48,760
three mils you want your old use arrows

345
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:51,040
to reorder button lists five items so

346
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:53,920
when it reorders it actually updates the

347
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,840
number that's off-screen so it'll

348
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:57,790
dynamically count how many there are and

349
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,530
then right now I have three out of five

350
00:15:59,530 --> 00:16:02,950
it will out of how many bottles you have

351
00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:04,900
on your top shelf right now it will

352
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:07,180
count them up put the number in and then

353
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:09,730
for whichever item that what whatever

354
00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:12,310
index that is in the list it will update

355
00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:15,100
it as you move the list without that you

356
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:17,620
don't have enough context to know what

357
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:19,510
the heck is this thing and how do I move

358
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:22,810
it I don't know like what number is it I

359
00:16:22,810 --> 00:16:24,010
mean we would go through all this

360
00:16:24,010 --> 00:16:26,650
trouble to make this list resour table

361
00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:28,780
with the arrows and you'd have no reason

362
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:31,510
why you probably wouldn't even use it so

363
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:34,570
this is one feature that I really got to

364
00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:36,910
hammer on and improve the accessibility

365
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:39,250
of and I think it turned out pretty good

366
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:41,860
there's a lot more work we have to do to

367
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:43,570
this app because of the way that the Dom

368
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:46,240
gets ripped out and re-rendered like

369
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,760
some pages you aren't notified when the

370
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:50,890
page changes like say I go to my

371
00:16:50,890 --> 00:16:53,410
collection at least in voiceover

372
00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:55,870
voiceover all I'll do that again expert

doesn't actually tell me when the page

381
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:15,640
changes when I click to a tab you are

382
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,920
currently on a group inside of HTML

384
00:17:20,589 --> 00:17:23,140

385
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:24,580
do on the other hand though that that's

386
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:26,130

391
00:17:38,610 --> 00:17:40,800
that got it part of the way there it's

392
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:43,440
making its a current page so i have some

393
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,050
visual feedback that tells me it's like

394
00:17:46,050 --> 00:17:47,970
that's the current thing but otherwise i

395
00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:50,760
have no idea so i added text off-screen

396
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:52,920
that changes when you change the page in

397
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,900
voiceover it doesn't tell me when the

398
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:56,460
page changes so that's something I'd

399
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:59,400
like to add but in Jaws on Internet

400
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,590
Explorer on Windows it actually does

401
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:03,450
pick up the change and that's the most

402
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:07,020
widely used screen reader so that's

403
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:08,850
pretty cool I was happy to find that out

404
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:10,380
it was actually a really smooth

405
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:15,120
experience I can actually show that what

406
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:18,600
that looks like so VirtualBox is a free

407
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,550
vm that you can download and you can get

408
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:22,830
all these different versions I have an

409
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:28,020
IE 11 version and with that you can go

410
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:31,530
and grab any browser like I said earlier

411
00:18:31,530 --> 00:18:34,740
the free demo version of Jaws is a

412
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:38,600
really sweet way to test the stuff USA

413
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:43,800
so jaws tab row minam hanky banister

414
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:46,470

416
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:56,820

418
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:02,370
you hover on it running at Bushmills 21

419

420
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:09,250
NVDA it

421
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:15,350
yes quit so I can open jaws just like a

422
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:17,330
normal application it's an application

423
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:18,830
that runs on top of a screen reader

424
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:21,440
which is super interesting like when I

425
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:24,020
first got into accessibility I had some

426
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:25,940
there was some mystery about what jaws

427
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:29,930
is how it works I actually didn't know

428
00:19:29,930 --> 00:19:31,670
they had a free demo version until a few

429
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:35,810
months ago and its unrestricted you can

430
00:19:35,810 --> 00:19:39,730
use it for 40 minutes at a time Oh

431
00:19:39,730 --> 00:19:49,310
doesn't want to let me open it come on

432
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:55,580
jobs hook us up gia jaws dialogue okay

433
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:59,300
13 boot sorry guys all right well I

434
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:01,160
think that experiment maybe not going to

435
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:04,940
work Grovyle d stealer internet explorer

436
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:07,580
button tool to should have planned that

437
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:12,980
a little better well one thing that we

438
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:20,030
could do is go back to either distiller

439
00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:23,150
or there's actually more to the Virgin

440
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:24,500
America site that I thought was really

441
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,900
interesting so I turned voiceover

442
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:28,850
voiceover on last night and started

443
00:20:28,850 --> 00:20:31,190
navigating to see what beyond just the

444
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:33,260
keyword stuff what would happen wrong

445
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:36,290

so i'm just gonna like close my eyes and

448
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:43,970
try to use this thing and see what has

455
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:09,320
go to San Francisco

456
00:21:09,330 --> 00:21:11,980
you are currently on a link inside of

457
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:15,220
HTML okay so the page change control

458
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:17,950
space I am on a new page i happen to

459
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:19,480
know because I could see it but I had no

460
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:21,640
idea that the page change so that's the

461
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:22,780
problem i was talking about with

462
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:25,240
distiller that we don't know when the

463
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:27,970
page changes so we need a little bit of

464
00:21:27,970 --> 00:21:31,840
help to notify the user so say i pick a

465
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:37,410
city no idea and again any feedback

466
00:21:37,410 --> 00:21:40,780
maybe i want to go to Portland there was

467
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:42,310
a notification at the top of the screen

468
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:44,290
that said something and I don't know

469
00:21:44,290 --> 00:21:47,260
what that is so actually I handled that

470
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:50,350
and distiller just the flat sweet marci

471
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:52,600

476
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:05,140
I'll get a similar notification expert

steal our HTML content forty-one percent

479
00:22:09,810 --> 00:22:13,570
for you are my side out alright so

480
00:22:13,570 --> 00:22:14,980
that's something that they could do on

481
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:17,530
that site to make that better and the

482
00:22:17,530 --> 00:22:19,660
technique that I used is called re alive

483
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:23,050
regions this isn't so much CSS related

484
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:25,810
but it's really basic HTML thing that

485
00:22:25,810 --> 00:22:28,570
you can do where you basically you're

486
00:22:28,570 --> 00:22:31,060
watching an element and if you put Aria

487
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:34,180
live and then an attribute in this case

488
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:37,150
I put assertive and that says hey

489
00:22:37,150 --> 00:22:38,980
whatever you're reading this is the most

490
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:40,990
important thing and it actually had a

491
00:22:40,990 --> 00:22:43,300
property called rude before because it's

492
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:45,340
supposed to be rude like hey stop what

493
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:47,140
you're doing read this thing and in the

494
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:50,110
case of an alert box something that

495
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:51,940
needs to be read right away that's

496
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:55,150
useful so actually we can go and inspect

497
00:22:55,150 --> 00:22:57,160
that in distiller and see what it looks

498
00:22:57,160 --> 00:23:03,820
like so in this case here we have a div

499
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:07,000
that says re alive assertive and it what

500
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,830
that means is when the page loads it's

501
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:10,930
watching for changes so all I have to do

502
00:23:10,930 --> 00:23:12,850
is append content into it and it will

503
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:16,260
read it so let's do a little experiment

504
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:19,480
i know i have jquery on this page so i'm

505
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:23,140
actually going to go look for it re Ally

506
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:33,700
of assertive okay so I have a hold of an

507
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:37,420
element I'm going to get this prepped so

508
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:39,250
that it won't be hearing all the typing

509
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:43,750
and voiceover but if i append something

510
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:51,640
to it I really hope this works voiceover

511
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,440

517
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:10,720
our HTML content voiceover off well I

518
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,640
don't think that worked and I wonder why

519
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,620
that's really interesting so it actually

520
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:17,650
has the content in the div that I

521
00:24:17,650 --> 00:24:19,480
appended it to but it didn't read it and

522
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:21,280
I would argue that that's probably a

523
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:23,920
limitation of voiceover because I had a

524
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,390
lot of trouble getting that to work as

525
00:24:25,390 --> 00:24:27,760
well and I found some times it was as

526
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,830
buggy as leaving the browser and coming

527
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:33,580
back and then it would work so that

528
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:35,950
ended up yeah being really challenging

529
00:24:35,950 --> 00:24:38,770
so I would recommend looking into re

530
00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:41,670
alive for these types of applications

531
00:24:41,670 --> 00:24:46,360
and that can improve notifying a user

532
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:51,370
when something is changing because as we

533
00:24:51,370 --> 00:24:53,800
saw with this site virgin america site

534
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,780
not only did it have a lot of keyboard

535
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:58,000
access problems but there's really a

536
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,520
lack of notification so it's really some

537
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:04,390
user experience issues do you guys have

538
00:25:04,390 --> 00:25:15,780
any questions

539
00:25:15,790 --> 00:25:52,070
sure yeah oh yeah it so for that so here

540
00:25:52,070 --> 00:25:55,850
i have the panel open i tend to put

541
00:25:55,850 --> 00:25:57,980
escape on the body so that I'm always

542
00:25:57,980 --> 00:26:00,850
listening for it so that way i could be

543
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:03,890
somewhere else like so the use case here

544
00:26:03,890 --> 00:26:06,440
is the keyboard if i skip to the

545
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:10,610
navigation Oh navigation we go back to

546
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:11,660
the top I went all the way to the

547
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:14,690
flutter so if i go to the navigation and

548
00:26:14,690 --> 00:26:18,350
i'm on this nav and then I keep going

549
00:26:18,350 --> 00:26:20,870
maybe because if i click off it'll close

550
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:24,230
it but I'm anywhere on the document and

551
00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:27,020
I hit escape I want to be listening for

552
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:29,630
it whereas if I'm scoped to something in

553
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:31,990
the nav with jquery or some other way of

554
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:34,820
binding that event if I'm scoped in too

555
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:37,700
far then I won't actually fire the event

556
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:40,250
and we like to use event delegation

557
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:43,190
anyway and target elements in a

558
00:26:43,190 --> 00:26:47,420
different way so for the scape key in

559
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:50,390
particular I like to scope to the body I

560
00:26:50,390 --> 00:26:52,700
actually I had one other thing quickly

561
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:55,310
it sounds like we should wrap up but I

562
00:26:55,310 --> 00:26:59,930
threw together a little gist of the code

563
00:26:59,930 --> 00:27:03,380
i use for the distiller sorting for the

564
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:06,890
the top shelf stuff and for that i made

565
00:27:06,890 --> 00:27:09,740
a really simple little JavaScript object

566
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:12,410
for the key codes so that I could

567
00:27:12,410 --> 00:27:15,620
basically put those really magic numbers

568
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:18,440
that like when you hit the scape key in

569
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:20,510
the event object you get returned the

570
00:27:20,510 --> 00:27:23,180
number the key code so rather than

571
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:24,650
having those sprinkled throughout my

572
00:27:24,650 --> 00:27:25,280
code

573
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:27,620
I put those all in one configurable

574
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:29,930
document and then I can just reference

575
00:27:29,930 --> 00:27:33,350
it with like some variable name that's

576
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:37,400
one way to make that better and then I'm

577
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,470
always listening to the Escape key and I

578
00:27:39,470 --> 00:27:42,110
can check which key code it was because

579
00:27:42,110 --> 00:27:43,820
you're actually listening to any key

580
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:46,610
event but you only want to do something

581
00:27:46,610 --> 00:27:48,320
if the condition is right and those

582
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:51,100
conditions are was it the Escape key and

583
00:27:51,100 --> 00:28:15,509
am I on the right page am I sorting yeah

584
00:28:15,519 --> 00:28:20,480
totally yeah so for this on top shelf we

585
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,549
listen for the Escape key and then we

586
00:28:22,549 --> 00:28:24,470
trigger an event and that's a nap level

587
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:27,799
event so that way we are always firing

588
00:28:27,799 --> 00:28:30,049
the event and then whether or not the

589
00:28:30,049 --> 00:28:32,149
listener is bound and it will actually

590
00:28:32,149 --> 00:28:34,789
do something about it it makes it so

591
00:28:34,789 --> 00:28:36,470
that you don't have all this logic

592
00:28:36,470 --> 00:28:38,539
buried in an event handler you actually

593
00:28:38,539 --> 00:28:41,240
have it like moved into some other easy

594
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:44,000
to maintain place and then this sortable

595
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,580
list observer is only dealing with like

596
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:49,460
the guts of the sortable list and then

597
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:52,399
it hands off the like starting and

598
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:56,000
stopping of the the disabled sorting

599
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:17,430
event is actually in a different object

600
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:24,020
yeah oh yeah in that case you would

601
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:25,520
probably want to scope it using

602
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:28,160
delegation like make sure that you're

603
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,660
actually on the right thing like

604
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:32,030
actually on this gist I have some events

605
00:29:32,030 --> 00:29:34,520
bound here and I'm listening to the body

606
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:37,370
but then I'm diving down into anything

607
00:29:37,370 --> 00:29:39,470
that has a data behavior of sort handle

608
00:29:39,470 --> 00:29:42,380
so that's agnostic to the type of tag it

609
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:44,210
just looks for the sort handle which is

610
00:29:44,210 --> 00:29:46,370
only available after you push the

611
00:29:46,370 --> 00:29:48,830
sorting button because it rips the Dom

612
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:50,059
in and out it's actually not even

613
00:29:50,059 --> 00:29:52,130
present but the event is always

614
00:29:52,130 --> 00:29:54,260
listening and when that condition is

615
00:29:54,260 --> 00:30:02,690
true then it will do stuff yeah cool so

616
00:30:02,690 --> 00:30:09,380
thanks for showing up yeah yes so key

617
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:11,360
press and key down there are slight

618
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:13,610
differences in which keys are available

619
00:30:13,610 --> 00:30:15,530
so you have to do a little monkeying

620
00:30:15,530 --> 00:30:28,950
around cool thanks
