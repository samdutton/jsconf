00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:42,100

as I talk to you this afternoon I want

2
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:43,900
you to think about something that you're

3
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:46,330
passionate about and that you're willing

4
00:00:46,330 --> 00:00:48,100
to share with other people that's

5
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:51,940
unrelated to programming here's my

6
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:55,000
example I'm Brian Brennan and I'm really

7
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,450
passionate about music in fact Alex kind

8
00:00:58,450 --> 00:00:59,440
of embarrassed me because that last

9
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:03,250
track was my band over the past 10 years

10
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:05,829
I've learned that playing music is is

11
00:01:05,829 --> 00:01:07,630
something that's really important to my

12
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:08,319
well-being

13
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:11,859
I play into bands and all of my free

14
00:01:11,859 --> 00:01:13,569
time that's not dedicated to programming

15
00:01:13,569 --> 00:01:15,119
community building I dedicate to

16
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:19,210
practicing and playing gigs so I want to

17
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:20,799
tell you a story about my first jazz

18
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:24,689
comp I it was 2011 it was Portland I

19
00:01:24,689 --> 00:01:27,249
showed up I was traveling alone I had

20
00:01:27,249 --> 00:01:28,389
just started Mozilla and I didn't really

21
00:01:28,389 --> 00:01:29,619
know anyone so I was just going by

22
00:01:29,619 --> 00:01:30,850
myself

23
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:32,639
and I was really shy and I was anxious

24
00:01:32,639 --> 00:01:35,109
because I was just super intimidated by

25
00:01:35,109 --> 00:01:37,149
all the awesome people that were there

26
00:01:37,149 --> 00:01:38,889
like I there were people that I followed

27
00:01:38,889 --> 00:01:40,509
on Twitter there were people who's like

28
00:01:40,509 --> 00:01:42,310
videos I had seen giving talks at

29
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:45,399
previous jazz comps and I was I was just

30
00:01:45,399 --> 00:01:47,409
super intimidating it was intimidating

31
00:01:47,409 --> 00:01:49,630
for me because I didn't know how I was

32
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:52,329
gonna fit in I hadn't thought of myself

33
00:01:52,329 --> 00:01:54,549
as having done anything particularly

34
00:01:54,549 --> 00:01:58,329
noteworthy noteworthy so I just didn't

35
00:01:58,329 --> 00:01:59,849
know I didn't know if I really belonged

36
00:01:59,849 --> 00:02:01,929
so I was walking around the edge of the

37
00:02:01,929 --> 00:02:04,359
room trying to be invisible and Paul

38
00:02:04,359 --> 00:02:07,149
Irish spotted me and somehow recognized

39
00:02:07,149 --> 00:02:09,160
me from the internet and he introduced

40
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,450
himself and invited me into his

41
00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:12,970
conversation and I was just I just felt

42
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:13,990
very welcome

43
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:16,240
and I asked Paul if I could share that

44
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,190
just really small tiny story and he

45
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:20,470
barely remembered it because for him it

46
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:21,880
wasn't a big deal at all

47
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:25,180
but for me it was such an act of warmth

48
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:26,980
and kindness at a time when I needed it

49
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,990
it made me feel welcome when I was

50
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:32,130
anxious about having a place to fit in

51
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:35,920
one thing kindness matters that's one of

52
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:36,940
the reasons I wanted to share that story

53
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:39,910
small actions matter in the right

54
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:42,670
context even the smallest kindness can

55
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:44,950
be deeply meaningful to someone in ways

56
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:47,290
that are unpredictable Paul didn't know

57
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:48,580
I was gonna be telling that story here I

58
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:50,290
asked him like a week ago it was just

59
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:52,120
for him a throwaway action but for me

60
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:54,910
something that really stuck with me also

61
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:56,470
congratulations on your wedding Paul

62
00:02:56,470 --> 00:03:03,550
wherever you are the other reason I

63
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:05,950
wanted to share that is because I want

64
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:07,720
us to start thinking about how we

65
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,780
welcome people into our communities a

66
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:12,400
lot of people approach communities in

67
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,660
the same way that I walked into that

68
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:15,910
conference shy and worried about fitting

69
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:19,630
in and anxious most new people go in and

70
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:21,460
they try to stay invisible they follow

71
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:23,110
us on Twitter they join our mailing list

72
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:25,660
they hang out in IRC channels but they

73
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:27,430
don't interact with us and we have a

74
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:29,730
word for that it's called lurking and

75
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:33,460
it's a great strategy I've lurked on the

76
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:35,380
edges of all of the communities that

77
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:37,120
I've joined before deciding that that's

78
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,680
a place where I could see myself fitting

79
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:42,670
in and I think we all have a job to

80
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:44,410
convert these workers into contributors

81
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:46,690
eventually we hope that we can conscient

82
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:47,940
turn them into contributors

83
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:50,110
collaborators and possibly even friends

84
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:53,980
and to do that we need to remember to be

85
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:56,890
patient and kind when the lurkers of our

86
00:03:56,890 --> 00:03:58,210
community the people standing around the

87
00:03:58,210 --> 00:04:01,090
outside try to make that first step we

88
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:03,730
were all novices once and we need to

89
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:05,650
remember what it was like when we were

90
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:08,470
new and when we needed help and that can

91
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:09,700
be an incredibly hard thing to do

92
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:12,280
because when you think about the same

93
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,960
thing all the time on a regular basis

94
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,190
when you're so entrenched in your own

95
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:17,500
community it can be really easy to

96
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:20,560
forget that people aren't also thinking

97
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,770
about that same thing all the time

98
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:25,570
something a colleague of mine Selena

99
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:27,389
Declan once said is

100
00:04:27,389 --> 00:04:29,250
the best thing we can do as experts in

101
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:32,069
our field is make it safer for novices

102
00:04:32,069 --> 00:04:34,319
to experiment and I think this is

103
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:36,689
absolutely true and more of us should

104
00:04:36,689 --> 00:04:40,139
spend time on that if you want to get

105
00:04:40,139 --> 00:04:42,090
better at this I recommend that you

106
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:43,800
volunteer your time as a teacher or a

107
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,819
mentor and preferably do it in person

108
00:04:46,819 --> 00:04:49,199
because guiding someone through learning

109
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:51,719
face-to-face helps you remember that you

110
00:04:51,719 --> 00:04:54,840
are dealing with a real person with

111
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,969
their own unique background rather than

112
00:04:56,969 --> 00:04:59,520
some abstract online identity that's in

113
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,400
need of your time and energy other

114
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,690
people are people too and that's another

115
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:07,979
thing we need to get better at

116
00:05:07,979 --> 00:05:10,979
recognizing that other people are people

117
00:05:10,979 --> 00:05:13,590
too even online we are all individual

118
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:15,900
human beings with our own individual

119
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:19,440
needs and values and feelings and we

120
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:24,300
need to respect that last year there was

121
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:27,060
a post on the Linux kernel developer

122
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:29,879
mailing list where Linus tears into

123
00:05:29,879 --> 00:05:31,919
another developer tells him to shut the

124
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:34,500
 up in all caps and then rips him

125
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,759
up in all caps and then rips him
apart for the way he handled some

126
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:38,909
situation and some of the developer

127
00:05:38,909 --> 00:05:40,889
response I saw that really bummed me out

128
00:05:40,889 --> 00:05:43,379
I saw people saying you need to have

129
00:05:43,379 --> 00:05:44,610
thicker skin if you want to be a

130
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:46,740
programmer or gettin'

131
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:48,120
development if you want to be coddled

132
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,909
and that's some really defeatist

133
00:05:50,909 --> 00:05:53,639
language it's saying we have a culture

134
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:56,520
of abuse that tears people down and it's

135
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,710
your job to change and get used to that

136
00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:00,750
rather than our responsibility to start

137
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:04,379
treating people better a command just

138
00:06:04,379 --> 00:06:06,270
Cheryl sharp who's a developer on the

139
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:08,339
kernel and she put herself out there

140
00:06:08,339 --> 00:06:10,199
saying that they really shouldn't stand

141
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:11,659
for that abuse in their community and

142
00:06:11,659 --> 00:06:14,190
Highness replied to Sarah and his

143
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:15,900
response left me even more despondent

144
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:18,060
than the original post and I want to

145
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:21,419
read part of it to you I do it partly

146
00:06:21,419 --> 00:06:23,669
because it's Who I am and partly because

147
00:06:23,669 --> 00:06:26,669
honestly I despise being subtle or nice

148
00:06:26,669 --> 00:06:29,310
I simply don't believe in being polite

149
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:33,810
or politically correct political

150
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:36,930
correctness I want to say a quick word

151
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:39,139
about that before I move on

152
00:06:39,139 --> 00:06:41,539
I see that term thrown a lot around in

153
00:06:41,539 --> 00:06:43,610
arguments on the internet and every time

154
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:45,199
I see it brought up it's by the people

155
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:48,319
who are resisting change and it's used

156
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:51,199
as a way to shut down conversations by

157
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:54,889
appealing to people's fears people here

158
00:06:54,889 --> 00:06:56,990
politically correct and they think that

159
00:06:56,990 --> 00:06:58,669
all the life of their culture will be

160
00:06:58,669 --> 00:07:01,009
extinguished if that's the path we go

161
00:07:01,009 --> 00:07:02,930
down that's why people throw it into

162
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:04,639
arguments they want other people to back

163
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:06,229
them up and say oh no we can't go down

164
00:07:06,229 --> 00:07:08,270
that slippery slope I'm not gonna start

165
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:13,009
wearing a tie to work so when you see

166
00:07:13,009 --> 00:07:14,419
this come up in an argument I want you

167
00:07:14,419 --> 00:07:15,889
to remember it's a loaded term and that

168
00:07:15,889 --> 00:07:17,169
you should rarely take it at face value

169
00:07:17,169 --> 00:07:19,250
that doesn't mean you have to reject

170
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:20,870
everything the person saying but it

171
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:22,069
means you should think about it

172
00:07:22,069 --> 00:07:25,099
just realize that political correctness

173
00:07:25,099 --> 00:07:30,710
is is not it's a loaded term anyway

174
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:32,750
being nice is not about being

175
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:35,870
politically correct at all being nice is

176
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:37,870
about respecting another human being as

177
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:40,520
individual with their own feelings needs

178
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:45,439
and values last year I saw Isaac

179
00:07:45,439 --> 00:07:47,839
Schluter give a talk called building

180
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:50,330
compassionate communities in tech it's

181
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:52,069
excellent you should absolutely watch it

182
00:07:52,069 --> 00:07:54,589
online you can just go type building

183
00:07:54,589 --> 00:07:56,240
compassionate communities to Ask Jeeves

184
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,659
and you'll find it it's the first result

185
00:07:58,659 --> 00:08:02,930
and in in his talk he recommends this

186
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:04,719
book called nonviolent communication and

187
00:08:04,719 --> 00:08:06,919
after he recommended that I read it and

188
00:08:06,919 --> 00:08:08,389
I was actually really excited to see and

189
00:08:08,389 --> 00:08:11,029
Gen Turner's talk two days ago

190
00:08:11,029 --> 00:08:13,069
lessons and emotional safety she also

191
00:08:13,069 --> 00:08:15,020
recommended that book so this is the

192
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:18,919
third time so read it but I want to I

193
00:08:18,919 --> 00:08:20,449
want to read you a quote from that book

194
00:08:20,449 --> 00:08:25,389
that has stuck with me we all pay dearly

195
00:08:25,389 --> 00:08:28,279
when people respond to our values and

196
00:08:28,279 --> 00:08:31,189
needs not out of a desire to give from

197
00:08:31,189 --> 00:08:35,349
the heart but out of fear guilt or shame

198
00:08:35,349 --> 00:08:38,269
sooner or later we will experience the

199
00:08:38,269 --> 00:08:40,279
consequences of diminished goodwill on

200
00:08:40,279 --> 00:08:42,169
the part of those who comply with our

201
00:08:42,169 --> 00:08:44,750
values out of a sense of either external

202
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:48,319
or internal coercion they to pay

203
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:50,839
emotionally for they are likely to feel

204
00:08:50,839 --> 00:08:53,010
resentment and decreased selfish

205
00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:55,350
deme when they respond to us out of fear

206
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:59,640
of guilt or shame furthermore each time

207
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,830
others associate us in their minds with

208
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:04,290
any of those feelings the likelihood of

209
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:06,300
their responding compassionately to our

210
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:09,890
needs and values in the future decreases

211
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:12,960
using guilt and public embarrassment and

212
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:15,810
fear to motivate people may get things

213
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:17,730
done in the short term but it comes at a

214
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:20,970
huge human cost and this is not me

215
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:23,580
saying you can't give criticism we need

216
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:25,170
criticism as software developers that's

217
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:28,200
how we build better software being nice

218
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,720
means realizing that you are dealing

219
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,850
with another human being and that how

220
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:36,720
you give that criticism matters we have

221
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,960
a stereotype as programmers that were

222
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,940
unemotional and cold and that we operate

223
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:44,730
on pure logic and the stereotype is

224
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:48,720
destroying us we are human beings we

225
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,390
have emotions and we feel it when we're

226
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:54,720
on the receiving end of negativity but

227
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,270
so many of us have internalized an

228
00:09:57,270 --> 00:09:59,760
unrealistic standard of how we're

229
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,040
supposed to date so we avoid talking

230
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,660
about it we don't talk about how we feel

231
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:05,850
we don't talk about our emotions we

232
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:08,790
learn to ignore them and we learn to

233
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:11,130
bottle them up and then we wonder why so

234
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:15,420
many of us burnout I want to tell a

235
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:17,550
story that's gonna seem unrelated but

236
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:19,470
I'm gonna bring it back around so just

237
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:25,620
hang with me I'm Hispanic and most of my

238
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:27,090
life I've struggled with my racial

239
00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:29,550
identity my mother is from Panama that's

240
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:31,500
a small country in Central America for

241
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:33,750
those of you who are unaware we have a

242
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:40,710
canal so my mother moved here when she

243
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:41,850
was 18

244
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:44,100
a few later a few years later she had me

245
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:48,120
and my mom knew that the trouble the

246
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,950
English as a second language students

247
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:51,570
get into in early developmental

248
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:53,970
education especially where I was growing

249
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:56,430
up and when I was growing up I've

250
00:10:56,430 --> 00:10:58,350
actually heard stories of some personal

251
00:10:58,350 --> 00:10:58,980
friends who are

252
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:00,270
english-as-a-second-language Stephenson

253
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:01,590
they were held back because their

254
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:02,520
teachers thought they were mentally

255
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:04,170
retarded because they couldn't speak

256
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:06,420
English and so my mother made the

257
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:06,970
decision

258
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:09,639
to raise us in an english-only speaking

259
00:11:09,639 --> 00:11:11,079
household so I never learned to speak

260
00:11:11,079 --> 00:11:14,230
Spanish and that turned out to be a big

261
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:16,180
deal for me because the other Hispanic

262
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:19,240
kids all spoke Spanish and I didn't fit

263
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,920
in with them and they held it against me

264
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:22,410
because I couldn't speak Spanish

265
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:27,610
they made me or I was I made myself feel

266
00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:29,079
like I didn't have the right to call

267
00:11:29,079 --> 00:11:33,279
myself a real Hispanic years later I'm

268
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:34,959
living with a guy who's a friend of a

269
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:38,050
friend and he would sometimes start

270
00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:40,899
complaining about Hispanic people not to

271
00:11:40,899 --> 00:11:46,360
other people like to me to my face I I

272
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,829
didn't mention this before but he also

273
00:11:47,829 --> 00:11:51,189
collected guns and I was quite

274
00:11:51,189 --> 00:11:53,560
intimidated but after a couple of times

275
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:56,470
I get up the courage to say to him dude

276
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:59,920
you know I'm Hispanic right and he goes

277
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,480
like without missing a beat he's like oh

278
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,220
well no no no you're not really Hispanic

279
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:08,939
you're different I was different I

280
00:12:08,939 --> 00:12:11,319
didn't fit into his mental model his

281
00:12:11,319 --> 00:12:13,600
stereotype of what a Hispanic person was

282
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,079
so I couldn't possibly be one and the

283
00:12:17,079 --> 00:12:19,120
worst part is that at the time I thought

284
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:22,649
he was right when he said that to me it

285
00:12:22,649 --> 00:12:25,870
brought up all of my issues about how I

286
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:28,540
thought about myself and I thought yeah

287
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:30,519
maybe he's right maybe I'm not a real

288
00:12:30,519 --> 00:12:36,279
Hispanic real programmer how many times

289
00:12:36,279 --> 00:12:41,170
have you guys heard that term thank you

290
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:43,180
I run a user group in New York with my

291
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:45,879
pal judge Schmitt called Brooklyn Jas we

292
00:12:45,879 --> 00:12:47,769
use the Jas comp code of conduct and we

293
00:12:47,769 --> 00:12:50,110
talk about every meeting we created

294
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:51,850
Brooklyn Jas because we want a safe

295
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:53,949
place for people to come and learn from

296
00:12:53,949 --> 00:12:56,889
each other but more importantly to meet

297
00:12:56,889 --> 00:12:58,899
each other and see each other as real

298
00:12:58,899 --> 00:13:02,829
human beings a couple of meetups ago a

299
00:13:02,829 --> 00:13:05,259
guy went up to one of our attendees a

300
00:13:05,259 --> 00:13:07,000
woman who's also a good friend of mine

301
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,250
and said you can't be a real programmer

302
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:13,540
you're too hot this guy didn't even

303
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:15,730
realize that he went up to someone and

304
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:17,559
said the equivalent of up you don't look

305
00:13:17,559 --> 00:13:19,870
like how I think you should so you don't

306
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:20,670
belong

307
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:25,050
I was so so mad and ashamed that this

308
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:27,390
happened at my Meetup and I'm still

309
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:28,860
trying to think of ways just beyond the

310
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:30,210
code of conduct to make sure this

311
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:32,220
doesn't happen again but in the meantime

312
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:35,690
I want all of you to do something for me

313
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:39,450
think really hard and try to make all of

314
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:41,940
your all of your unconscious stereotypes

315
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:43,620
that you might have about programmers

316
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:46,950
conscious think about them what we look

317
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:49,200
like the types of things we're supposed

318
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,510
to be interested in how we're supposed

319
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:54,330
to think and feel I want you to think

320
00:13:54,330 --> 00:13:56,130
about those things and I want you to

321
00:13:56,130 --> 00:13:57,990
remind yourself that all those things

322
00:13:57,990 --> 00:14:00,960
are I want you to

323
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,370
remember that we are all different and

324
00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:03,930
the one guaranteed thing we have in

325
00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:05,460
common is that we write software and

326
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:08,130
that's it other than that we're all

327
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:10,350
individuals with our own identities our

328
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:15,810
own needs and our own values it's our

329
00:14:15,810 --> 00:14:18,210
responsibility as members of the

330
00:14:18,210 --> 00:14:19,890
community and leaders of the community

331
00:14:19,890 --> 00:14:22,380
and members of various communities to

332
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:25,020
build and maintain a culture where it's

333
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:26,670
safe to express our different needs and

334
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:29,430
values where it's safe to just exist

335
00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:34,500
without emotional or physical fear think

336
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,240
about the people lurking on the edges

337
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,460
and what kind of example you want to set

338
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:41,250
for them think about the effects your

339
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:43,310
words have on other people

340
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:45,840
Adam Braille gave a powerful talk at

341
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,370
Jay's coffee you last year called people

342
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:49,650
first and many of the things that he's

343
00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:51,090
said in that talk has have stuck with me

344
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:53,540
but I want to share one particular quote

345
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:56,970
no matter your title it is your job to

346
00:14:56,970 --> 00:14:58,620
make the people around you feel cared

347
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:01,910
about empowered and encouraged and

348
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:06,660
humanized as much as the internet

349
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:08,780
connects us is incredibly dehumanizing

350
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:11,820
need to recognize and embrace our

351
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:13,230
responsibility for taking care of each

352
00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:13,970
other

353
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:16,590
we need to recognize and acknowledge the

354
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:18,420
positive influence we have on each

355
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:21,420
other's lives it shouldn't need to be a

356
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,070
special occasion to let a friend to know

357
00:15:23,070 --> 00:15:26,250
how much they mean to you if you see

358
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:27,720
someone who's under attack stand up for

359
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,160
them and if you see someone who's

360
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:31,860
hurting reach out to them and if you

361
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:33,279
yourself are hurting

362
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:38,620
talk to someone don't ignore it about

363
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:41,410
eight years ago I lived through my worst

364
00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:44,920
period of depression I was in college at

365
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:46,899
the time and I stopped going to class I

366
00:15:46,899 --> 00:15:49,120
failed out of school I stopped going to

367
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,699
work I dropped all of my hobbies my

368
00:15:51,699 --> 00:15:53,519
computer broke and I didn't even care I

369
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:56,740
didn't bother to get it fixed I don't

370
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:57,970
know what other people's Depression

371
00:15:57,970 --> 00:15:59,379
looks like but for me it's a profound

372
00:15:59,379 --> 00:16:02,860
deep emptiness but I never talked about

373
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:04,870
it with anyone I didn't want to burden

374
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:06,639
people and frankly I was ashamed with

375
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:10,079
myself how couldn't I control this I

376
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:12,459
don't have a lot of memories from that

377
00:16:12,459 --> 00:16:14,290
period but I do remember the day I

378
00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:17,920
decided to get help I was driving on a

379
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,959
freeway and a car was coming in the

380
00:16:19,959 --> 00:16:21,519
opposite direction and as it was about

381
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:23,769
to pass me I had a thought that almost

382
00:16:23,769 --> 00:16:26,499
turned into an action I could swerve

383
00:16:26,499 --> 00:16:27,610
into this car right now and it wouldn't

384
00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:30,129
matter and it was a thought so strong I

385
00:16:30,129 --> 00:16:31,720
could feel it in my hands physically

386
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:34,689
that I really wanted to do it and at the

387
00:16:34,689 --> 00:16:37,779
last moment I didn't I thought about

388
00:16:37,779 --> 00:16:39,579
what I'd almost done and I thought about

389
00:16:39,579 --> 00:16:40,990
my mom and I thought about my brother

390
00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:43,680
and I pulled over and I started crying

391
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:46,360
and it took that moment and coming that

392
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:48,040
close for me to realize that I couldn't

393
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,839
handle it on my own and this is

394
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:51,069
something that I couldn't change in

395
00:16:51,069 --> 00:16:54,850
myself or by myself and I know that

396
00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:56,439
story makes a lot of you feel awkward so

397
00:16:56,439 --> 00:16:58,689
I apologize if it's any consolation I'm

398
00:16:58,689 --> 00:17:00,339
pretty sure I feel more awkward about it

399
00:17:00,339 --> 00:17:04,899
so but if I was talking to you about

400
00:17:04,899 --> 00:17:06,939
breaking my wrist or getting malaria

401
00:17:06,939 --> 00:17:08,350
that would have been an easy story to

402
00:17:08,350 --> 00:17:11,140
tell but we have a social stigma around

403
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:12,789
mental health so it's not something we

404
00:17:12,789 --> 00:17:15,010
talk about and so so many of us suffer

405
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:17,500
quietly and alone a shame that we have

406
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:18,819
this problem in ourselves that we can't

407
00:17:18,819 --> 00:17:21,579
fix and I think it might be worse for

408
00:17:21,579 --> 00:17:23,770
programmers because not only do we have

409
00:17:23,770 --> 00:17:25,569
that additional stereotype of being

410
00:17:25,569 --> 00:17:28,089
unemotional but because we are supposed

411
00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:30,070
to be able to fix things kind of what we

412
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:33,659
do so we need to take care of each other

413
00:17:33,659 --> 00:17:36,010
let people know that you're there for

414
00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:40,870
them so when I was telling some of my

415
00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:42,220
friends I was gonna give this talk

416
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:45,130
the most common advice was oh just be

417
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:45,549
funny

418
00:17:45,549 --> 00:17:47,200
just use a lot of animating

419
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:51,730
gifts so I'm pretty sure I nailed it but

420
00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:52,419
for real

421
00:17:52,419 --> 00:17:54,760
I I know this has been some sustained

422
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:56,230
real talk and I want to thank you for

423
00:17:56,230 --> 00:17:58,149
giving me your attention

424
00:17:58,149 --> 00:18:00,159
I actually feel incredibly positive

425
00:18:00,159 --> 00:18:01,630
about our future more than I have in the

426
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:06,309
past I see us starting to have open hard

427
00:18:06,309 --> 00:18:08,620
conversations about a lot of this stuff

428
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:10,149
where we wouldn't have dared talked

429
00:18:10,149 --> 00:18:12,909
about it before I see more people

430
00:18:12,909 --> 00:18:14,230
starting to recognize that there is

431
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:17,110
humanity behind what we do and seeing

432
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:18,399
that we need to learn how to deal with

433
00:18:18,399 --> 00:18:19,929
that just as much as we need to learn

434
00:18:19,929 --> 00:18:21,130
how to deal with anything else in our

435
00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:24,700
field I've met and I continue to meet so

436
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:26,080
many awesome people through programming

437
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,269
and made friendships they even if I quit

438
00:18:28,269 --> 00:18:29,440
programming tomorrow I'd want to

439
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:33,760
maintain in the beginning I asked you to

440
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:34,779
think about some of the things are

441
00:18:34,779 --> 00:18:36,039
passionate about that aren't programming

442
00:18:36,039 --> 00:18:38,200
and as we wrap this up and go into our

443
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,570
last evening of celebration I want you

444
00:18:40,570 --> 00:18:42,490
to remember those things and when you

445
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:44,559
talk to each other don't just talk about

446
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:46,149
what you do or where you work but in

447
00:18:46,149 --> 00:18:48,730
your entire self to the conversation you

448
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:50,139
are so much more than just your opinion

449
00:18:50,139 --> 00:18:53,950
on ember or promises remember that being

450
00:18:53,950 --> 00:18:55,899
awesome to each other starts with being

451
00:18:55,899 --> 00:18:59,289
awesome to ourselves thank you very much
