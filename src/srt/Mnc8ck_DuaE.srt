1
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:09,430

hi everybody uh how's everybody doing

2
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:12,230
pretty good cool cool

3
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:15,799
so my name is Trish you can also find me

4
00:00:15,799 --> 00:00:18,800
at Beach on the internet and my pronouns

5
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,730
are she her presently I am a front-end

6
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:25,550
engineer at slack where I focus on

7
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:28,160
working with a team of amazing front-end

8
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,410
engineers building our internal design

9
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:32,739
system and component lower library

10
00:00:32,739 --> 00:00:34,579
specifically building out react

11
00:00:34,579 --> 00:00:36,410
components that comprise a foundational

12
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:39,140
layer of the slack client you know and

13
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:45,139
love so I've been working in the tech

14
00:00:45,139 --> 00:00:47,600
industry a little bit over 10 years at

15
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,850
this point and if there is one thing I

16
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:55,699
am familiar with its failure but I'm

17
00:00:55,699 --> 00:00:57,819
here to tell you that that's ok

18
00:00:57,819 --> 00:01:02,120
everybody fails we fail and then we

19
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:04,580
learn and then we probably fail again in

20
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:08,840
an equally spectacular way for example

21
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:11,060
just today at lunch

22
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:15,230
I grabbed my Colby and Fried Chicken and

23
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:17,270
went by the pool to sit with Johnathan

24
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:20,240
to have food and and I realized but 10

25
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,340
minutes later my shorts are all wet

26
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:26,210
because I sat in a pool of water which

27
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:27,890
then of course like luckily went

28
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:29,240
upstairs changed my pants and then I

29
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:31,100
realized oh I was wearing these I wasn't

30
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:32,210
wearing these shorts because I spilled

31
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:35,570
food on them yesterday that's ok I will

32
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:37,070
learn my lesson and tomorrow I'll look

33
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:39,530
if I sit down before sitting in another

34
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:43,190
pool of water oh good I'm sure as

35
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:45,320
front-end engineers yourselves you are

36
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:46,970
all equally familiar with this feeling

37
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:47,540
of failure

38
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:49,730
everybody knows browser rendering

39
00:01:49,730 --> 00:01:52,159
inconsistencies often feel like you're

40
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:56,030
in the Wild West dealing with web

41
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:58,070
compilers are kind of like a black box

42
00:01:58,070 --> 00:02:01,220
of nightmares and then there's the

43
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:03,310
dreaded last step of any project

44
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:06,910
accessibility

45
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:11,060
so allow me to share a personal story of

46
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:14,000
failure has anybody here you slacked

47
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,850
before

48
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:21,500
cool cool okay so maybe a little bit

49
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,450
over a year ago I was getting ready to

50
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:25,580
launch my first big feature while

51
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:27,740
working at slack and I felt super

52
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:29,270
excited I was gonna share this new tool

53
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:30,770
with everybody here who raised their

54
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:32,930
hands a bunch of my friends a little bit

55
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:35,060
of my family and it was great great

56
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:39,140
feeling and then I got a message like

57
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:40,150
this one

58
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:44,540
so this reads hatred Congrats on the

59
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:47,630
launch by the way are you using options

60
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:49,220
list because I'm not sure if you realize

61
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:51,470
but your feature is completely

62
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:54,380
inaccessible that means I can't use it

63
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:57,050
with my screen reader so sorry to rain

64
00:02:57,050 --> 00:03:04,100
on your parade love George oh it was

65
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:06,080
really hard for me not to feel like a

66
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,800
complete failure at this point

67
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,840
thankfully at SLAC I'm really proud to

68
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,360
say that we treat accessibility bugs as

69
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,519
broken functionality and product

70
00:03:16,519 --> 00:03:19,970
blockers what and the web accessibility

71
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:22,459
bug means is that there's real humans

72
00:03:22,459 --> 00:03:24,350
out there on the internet who cannot

73
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:26,060
interact with your website or your web

74
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:29,120
product and for slack where we have over

75
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,600
10 million users online daily being

76
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,920
unable to communicate with your

77
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:37,760
teammates interact with content or being

78
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,320
blocked from your doing doing your work

79
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:43,030
at all is completely unacceptable

80
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:47,320
but accessibility is by no means easy

81
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:50,060
even the queen bee herself had some

82
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:52,280
issues with this earlier this year when

83
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:54,410
she was sued over her website Beyonce

84
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:57,070
calm being inaccessible

85
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:59,989
since then the Internet has come

86
00:03:59,989 --> 00:04:04,040
together to put a petition to hire one

87
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,769
of my amazing and talented co-workers

88
00:04:05,769 --> 00:04:10,250
Mina Marcum you may have heard of her to

89
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:13,820
remedy the situation so I do hope you

90
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:15,620
will all go and sign this petition so we

91
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:19,010
can resolve this matter quickly

92
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:24,040
so I am NOT an accessibility expert but

93
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,960
luckily when I received this message

94
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:28,750
from Jorge on our accessibility team it

95
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:31,780
was only after an internal lunch and all

96
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:33,550
that he was letting me know was that I

97
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:35,920
had a lot more to learn and a little bit

98
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:38,470
of work to do before I could launch this

99
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:42,370
to the general public since then I have

100
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:44,620
gone through a ton of training and I've

101
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:46,270
learned a lot about the complexities of

102
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:48,580
screen readers how to test for

103
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:50,860
accessibility and how to build inclusive

104
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:53,050
experiences and that's what I want to

105
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:55,660
share with y'all today as it turns out I

106
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:57,940
am NOT an accessibility expert but you

107
00:04:57,940 --> 00:04:59,530
don't need to be to do this kind of work

108
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:03,670
so let's flip the script and instead of

109
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:05,440
talking about how to fail let's talk

110
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,560
about how not to fail at accessibility

111
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:11,950
cool yes awesome

112
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:13,930
all right so we'll cover three main

113
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:16,390
areas today first how do you know

114
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:17,590
whether or not your website is

115
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:20,430
accessible or inaccessible to start with

116
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:23,200
secondly once you've identified some

117
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,330
bugs how do you go about coding to fix

118
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:28,540
those bugs and then lastly how can you

119
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:30,490
adapt your process to prevent bugs like

120
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:33,510
that from happening in the first place

121
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:39,370
okay kicking things off with testing so

122
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:42,000
what is accessibility you mean at all

123
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,550
it's a very broadly scoped term but it

124
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:47,490
look luckily it is thoroughly documented

125
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:49,840
if you've ever had to look up the

126
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:53,470
definition of an HTML element or a CSS

127
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:55,450
property you may be familiar with the

128
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:58,690
w3c organization not only do they have

129
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:00,970
that handy resource but they also have

130
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:02,800
what is known as the web content

131
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,010
accessibility guidelines or W CAG for

132
00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:09,490
short so if you visit this website you

133
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:12,010
will find a very lovely text heavy

134
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:14,080
verbose document where you can learn

135
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,700
anything that you've ever wanted to know

136
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:17,980
about accessibility some light reading

137
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:24,850
if you will what they distill are what

138
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:27,250
feature what makes features on the web

139
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:29,050
accessible or not accessible and they

140
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:30,230
grade them based

141
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:35,060
a double-a and triple-a at SLAC we shoot

142
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:36,950
to have double-a compliance for all of

143
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:38,270
our features that we release and

144
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:40,850
wherever possible triple a compliance as

145
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:46,910
well cool so the spectrum of human

146
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:49,040
abilities and the tech that exists to

147
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,350
support them is infinitely broad and

148
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:53,990
while I'd love to cover everything we've

149
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:56,390
got like 20 minutes left so we're gonna

150
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:57,680
start with the hello world of

151
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,320
accessibility if you will so here are

152
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,540
some four areas that you can get started

153
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:06,980
with testing today cool first one is

154
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:09,440
color contrast the Teenage Mutant Ninja

155
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,660
Turtle talked earlier help preface this

156
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:14,870
so it's awesome second up is user

157
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:19,070
interface zoom then keyboard interaction

158
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:22,880
model and lastly building in screen

159
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:27,890
reader support okay so what does color

160
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:29,870
contrast mean we got a brief look at

161
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:32,090
this earlier but in general we're not

162
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:33,740
trying to analyze every single color

163
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:36,260
across your beautiful website instead

164
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:37,550
we're trying to make sure that the

165
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:39,410
information and interactive elements

166
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:41,540
that you have are understandable and

167
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:44,480
perceivable by all users and that

168
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,490
specifically is looking at things like

169
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:50,930
the normal text on your website large

170
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:53,060
text on your website which is 14-point

171
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:55,580
and bold and above or 18-point and above

172
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:59,630
and also interactive or user interface

173
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:02,390
elements such as iconography and form

174
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:07,630
elements there is a super handy tool

175
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:11,240
called the color contrast analyzer where

176
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,400
you can either input your hex values or

177
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,440
even just use the eyedropper tool and

178
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,690
it'll immediately tell you at the bottom

179
00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:18,980
whether or not you're hitting those

180
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:22,610
contrast standards there are also a few

181
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:24,920
websites I think somebody mentioned one

182
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:27,200
earlier web aim where you can input the

183
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,390
URL of your website and it'll do a scan

184
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:31,690
to kind of check if there are any in

185
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:32,770
[Music]

186
00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:36,229
areas that don't meet the guidelines it

187
00:08:36,229 --> 00:08:39,320
should come as no surprise but using

188
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,910
light grey text on a white background

189
00:08:41,910 --> 00:08:46,100
not meet accessibility standards okay

190
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:49,250
next up we have user interface zoom and

191
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:52,920
this one my coworker jokes that this is

192
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,840
the easiest one to test for but it's

193
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,280
also the easiest one for people to

194
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:58,620
forget the user interface zoom refers to

195
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:00,960
the browser's built-in functionality to

196
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:03,330
zoom into your web content using either

197
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:06,140
Apple plus minus or control plus minus

198
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:09,750
at slack our designers provide mock-ups

199
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:11,400
at all of the levels of zoom that we

200
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,650
support and the easiest way for you to

201
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:15,990
go about testing this is just doing that

202
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:18,660
you can take your website hit Apple plus

203
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:20,850
plus and then spend like a week using

204
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:22,680
your website like that and try to see if

205
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,870
you notice anything where areas feel

206
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:31,170
funky or broken next we've got keyboard

207
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:32,850
interaction model or keyboard

208
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:35,880
navigability this refers to navigating

209
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,920
your website entirely with a keyboard

210
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,710
only using the common patterns of tab

211
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:43,350
and shift tab to move backwards and

212
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:46,650
forwards through elements and then using

213
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:49,080
things like the arrow keys enter escape

214
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:51,090
and spacebar to interact with those

215
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:55,680
elements every year in May our

216
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,320
accessibility team hosts a challenge for

217
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,000
the global accessibility awareness day

218
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,640
where we encourage all of the employees

219
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,650
at slack to take our mice and put them

220
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:06,660
in the desk drawer and only use your

221
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:10,140
keyboard to navigate our products like I

222
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:11,640
tried this last year and I was really

223
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,590
really surprised to see what areas I was

224
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:15,600
able to make more efficient and what

225
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,280
areas I got stuck because I wasn't

226
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,810
familiar with the common patterns that

227
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:24,180
existed we also have a handy palette of

228
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:26,130
keyboard shortcuts that you can access

229
00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:30,630
using command /and this is awesome

230
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:33,330
because it not only helps folks with

231
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:36,180
limited mobility but it also helps

232
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:38,760
enable to enable people to become power

233
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:42,630
users of slack so once you've got your

234
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:45,000
keyboard navigation down the guidelines

235
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,150
also require you to indicate what has

236
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:51,360
current focus you can tell here with the

237
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,950
focus ring it's like the blue fuzzy

238
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:54,840
circle that follows around where you

239
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:59,010
navigating with the tab and lastly if

240
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:02,220
you are navigating around and you notice

241
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:04,800
that you can tap into an area but you

242
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,490
can't tab away from it

243
00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:10,020
this is what's known as a keyboard trap

244
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:12,920
and it's something that you should avoid

245
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:20,730
like this cat very sad sorry cool okay

246
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:22,590
so last but not least we're moving it to

247
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:24,930
some trickier territory and testing for

248
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:30,060
screen reader support luckily if you've

249
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:32,220
already cleaned up your keyboard

250
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:34,440
interaction model you're 50 halfway

251
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,690
there to making sure your website is

252
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:40,560
screen reader supported if you are using

253
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,020
a Mac there's software built-in to help

254
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:44,910
you test this and you can access it

255
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:46,350
through the system's preference panel

256
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:48,540
then the accessibility pane and then

257
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:51,210
enable voiceover there are also free

258
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:53,220
software options for PCs and other

259
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:58,620
platforms like NVDA ok anybody here use

260
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:02,310
a screen reader before oh it's good nice

261
00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:05,490
very nice ok so let's let's listen to a

262
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:07,320
quick example of what it's like using a

263
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,030
screen reader so I want you to listen

264
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:10,650
along here and see if you can identify

265
00:12:10,650 --> 00:12:13,320
what is happening you are currently on

266
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:15,420
web content to enter the what area press

267
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:19,080

00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:42,030
select or deselect this checkbox press

277
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:44,220
control option space to navigate items

278
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:46,020
on this toolbar press control option and

279
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:48,390
then up arrow power toggle button Wow

280
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:54,720
toggle button any guessin oh nice nicely

281
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,640
then okay so let's look at that one more

282
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:59,040
time with the visual cues for anybody

283
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,620
who didn't get that it was Facebook so

284
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:02,640
you'll notice that as you're navigating

285
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:04,890
the keyboard or the screen reader will

286
00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:06,680
announce what has current flow

287
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:08,839
yes it'll say what is that type of

288
00:13:08,839 --> 00:13:10,759
element that is being focused the

289
00:13:10,759 --> 00:13:13,339
definition of it and with things like

290
00:13:13,339 --> 00:13:15,589
the the like where you can choose six

291
00:13:15,589 --> 00:13:18,139
different legs it'll update as you are

292
00:13:18,139 --> 00:13:21,949

00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:50,209
of a toolbar to select or deselect this

304
00:13:50,209 --> 00:13:52,670
checkbox press control option space to

305
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:54,170
navigate items on this toolbar press

306
00:13:54,170 --> 00:13:55,939
control option and then up arrow pas

307
00:13:55,939 --> 00:13:57,410
toggle button Wow

308
00:13:57,410 --> 00:14:03,499
toggle button cool okay so in addition

309
00:14:03,499 --> 00:14:05,959
to these basics screen readers also we

310
00:14:05,959 --> 00:14:08,749
use a tool known as the rotor and this

311
00:14:08,749 --> 00:14:10,279
is one of the most important reasons you

312
00:14:10,279 --> 00:14:11,600
should make sure you have clean and

313
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:15,350
semantic HTML because the rotor scans

314
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:17,149
your content and that's what it uses to

315
00:14:17,149 --> 00:14:19,249
populate the menus here's what it looks

316
00:14:19,249 --> 00:14:22,910
like Chrome recipe Google search Google

317
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:25,279
Chrome window hope Mr P Google search

318
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:28,370
web content links menu you are currently

319
00:14:28,370 --> 00:14:30,470
in a voiceover menu this is a list link

320
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:33,860
link accessibility help link XS headings

321
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:36,649
menu heading level 1 accessibility

322
00:14:36,649 --> 00:14:38,329
heading level heading level 1 surf

323
00:14:38,329 --> 00:14:40,040
heading left heading level petit level 3

324
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:42,019
heading level 3 easy homemade ok to now

325
00:14:42,019 --> 00:14:45,199
full recipe link easy homemade recipe

326
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:49,009
just cool so you can pull up that menu

327
00:14:49,009 --> 00:14:51,980
using the control was it control option

328
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:54,220
you and then left and right to navigate

329
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:56,379
between the different menu options

330
00:14:56,379 --> 00:14:58,730
you'll notice that it had like one two

331
00:14:58,730 --> 00:15:00,980
three and those are like h1 h2 h3 and

332
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:03,139
also that the screen reader did not know

333
00:15:03,139 --> 00:15:05,779
how to pronounce po k properly it said

334
00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:10,220
poke pretty sure cool alright nice job

335
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:13,189
everybody you're all on a roll so give

336
00:15:13,189 --> 00:15:14,540
your neighbor a high-five and like we'll

337
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:20,150
keep on moving oh sweet

338
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:24,009
okay so the next area here is how do we

339
00:15:24,009 --> 00:15:26,499
improve our code to have clean

340
00:15:26,499 --> 00:15:30,009
accessible experiences there are three

341
00:15:30,009 --> 00:15:31,449
broad level things that you want to

342
00:15:31,449 --> 00:15:33,999
consider here first of all as I

343
00:15:33,999 --> 00:15:35,799
mentioned for screen readers providing

344
00:15:35,799 --> 00:15:38,769
clean semantic HTML and also proper Aria

345
00:15:38,769 --> 00:15:41,529
labels is super important then you'll

346
00:15:41,529 --> 00:15:43,389
get very comfortable with programmatic

347
00:15:43,389 --> 00:15:45,609
focus management which everybody loves

348
00:15:45,609 --> 00:15:48,489
JavaScript so hopefully easy and then

349
00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:50,529
you can figure out how to leverage

350
00:15:50,529 --> 00:15:52,899
modern modern coding practices to help

351
00:15:52,899 --> 00:15:57,220
as well okay let's step back earlier to

352
00:15:57,220 --> 00:15:59,619
that call-out from George the feature

353
00:15:59,619 --> 00:16:01,359
that I was working on at the time was a

354
00:16:01,359 --> 00:16:03,699
pretty common web interface pattern so

355
00:16:03,699 --> 00:16:05,589
there's a box there's a list below it

356
00:16:05,589 --> 00:16:07,689
you type into the box the list below it

357
00:16:07,689 --> 00:16:09,819
gets filtered this is what's known as a

358
00:16:09,819 --> 00:16:12,759
combo box so I want you to take a look

359
00:16:12,759 --> 00:16:15,879
at the before and after I'm fixing

360
00:16:15,879 --> 00:16:18,129
before and after I fix the accessibility

361
00:16:18,129 --> 00:16:23,199
issue can anybody tell the difference no

362
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:27,850
not a trick is a trick question okay to

363
00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:29,559
me they look exactly the same they both

364
00:16:29,559 --> 00:16:32,009
still have a box for the list below it

365
00:16:32,009 --> 00:16:35,019
the problem was that I when I first set

366
00:16:35,019 --> 00:16:37,089
out to build it I approached it exactly

367
00:16:37,089 --> 00:16:39,489
the way that it sounds so I built the

368
00:16:39,489 --> 00:16:42,549
text element and then I built a list

369
00:16:42,549 --> 00:16:48,089
menu element and since they are like

370
00:16:48,089 --> 00:16:50,769
typographically similar there have

371
00:16:50,769 --> 00:16:52,660
closed composition on the page or like

372
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:54,609
told pixels apart and they're contained

373
00:16:54,609 --> 00:16:56,139
together against like a white background

374
00:16:56,139 --> 00:16:59,489
box obviously they're related elements

375
00:16:59,489 --> 00:17:02,079
the problem there is with my initial

376
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:04,839
assumption even though to me they were

377
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:06,850
visually distinct as separate elements

378
00:17:06,850 --> 00:17:09,549
to a screen reader they do not have the

379
00:17:09,549 --> 00:17:11,799
benefit of those visual cues so we were

380
00:17:11,799 --> 00:17:13,480
still treating it as two separate

381
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:16,870
elements instead I needed to switch to a

382
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:18,100
completely different underlying

383
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:22,240
architecture from two components to one

384
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:25,120
component so this way using the Select

385
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:27,010
even though it also has the text input

386
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:30,129
and an options list the screenreader can

387
00:17:30,129 --> 00:17:32,000
only maintain focus on one

388
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,810
at a time so this breeder will focus on

389
00:17:35,810 --> 00:17:39,890
the select and then the internal child

390
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:42,200
components have a way of updating the

391
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:44,420
parent component to then tell the screen

392
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:46,670
reader what is happening whether

393
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:48,620
somebody is navigating up and down in

394
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:50,660
the list or if they are typing into the

395
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:54,460
box but how does that even work weird

396
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:55,610
okay

397
00:17:55,610 --> 00:17:58,160
so back to that handy w3c document

398
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,560
they've also defined an API for

399
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:02,960
indicating to assistive technologies

400
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:05,060
what is happening on screen this is

401
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:07,430
known as Aria or accessible rich

402
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:11,300
Internet applications what's happening

403
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:13,280
behind the scenes is that this

404
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:16,280
accessibility API parses the Dom on your

405
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:18,740
website communicates that to the screen

406
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:20,900
reader or whatever assistive technology

407
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:24,950
is being used and then that information

408
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:28,990
gets output to a human on the other side

409
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:32,330
so spoiler alert but just in the same

410
00:18:32,330 --> 00:18:34,850
way that browsers sometimes have trouble

411
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:37,850
rendering CSS they can also sometimes

412
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:39,410
have a little bit trouble understanding

413
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:43,130
your Aria labels this is not a huge

414
00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:46,610
problem just there reminder to always be

415
00:18:46,610 --> 00:18:49,310
testing thoroughly across cross platform

416
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:51,410
and cross browser as I'm sure that you

417
00:18:51,410 --> 00:18:57,080
all already do okay so it's like we've

418
00:18:57,080 --> 00:19:00,200
now learned to build an aria pattern

419
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:02,450
with each techSpec we write so that

420
00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:04,850
before we start coding anything we

421
00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:07,040
should know that the component should be

422
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:11,240
accessible from the start however as I

423
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,500
mentioned we're building component

424
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:14,330
libraries and since they have to support

425
00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:16,840
a multitude of different use cases

426
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:19,010
sometimes doesn't look as simple and

427
00:19:19,010 --> 00:19:20,540
inside it looks a little bit more like

428
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:24,140
this just make sure that you workshop

429
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:25,550
these things with your peers and that

430
00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:29,000
you're covering all of your bases once

431
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,860
you get to the code level things start

432
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:32,060
looking a little bit more like this

433
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:34,160
where you may have a feature spread out

434
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,710
across a few separate components and

435
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:38,360
then you can use things like JavaScript

436
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:41,510
utilities to build and connect the IDs

437
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:45,380
that are informing your Aria attributes

438
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:48,049
okay once you have everything built out

439
00:19:48,049 --> 00:19:50,090
properly here's what a combo box should

440
00:19:50,090 --> 00:19:52,669
sound like when it's word filter fortune

441
00:19:52,669 --> 00:19:54,520
list combo box search message actions

442
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:56,990

slack app copy leg slack delete message

444
00:19:59,240 --> 00:19:59,690

448
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:12,590
so you all are on a roll thank you again

449
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:14,210
for sticking through it we got one more

450
00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:16,850
section to go okay

451
00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:19,130
the next section I know everybody here

452
00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:21,710
oh oh okay I know everybody here loves

453
00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:24,020
bugs but how do you prevent bugs from

454
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:26,330
happening in the first place I've gone a

455
00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:28,610
few going over a few tips but let's step

456
00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:30,049
back to what things look like it's like

457
00:20:30,049 --> 00:20:33,169
a year ago when I joined there were 75

458
00:20:33,169 --> 00:20:35,120
front-end engineers but there was only

459
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:38,720
one accessibility expert as I mentioned

460
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,850
I am NOT that expert we have the famed

461
00:20:40,850 --> 00:20:43,820
Todd Kurtz who is incredibly talented

462
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:44,990
and amazing to work with

463
00:20:44,990 --> 00:20:48,020
but even so one engineer is not enough

464
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:49,549
to support all the accessibility

465
00:20:49,549 --> 00:20:52,039
features we want to include so over the

466
00:20:52,039 --> 00:20:53,480
past year we've rolled out training

467
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:55,070
similar to this one to ensure all

468
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:57,950
front-end engineers at slack understand

469
00:20:57,950 --> 00:20:59,630
the accessibility criteria that we are

470
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:01,640
shooting for and how to build and test

471
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:04,520
for it more importantly that means that

472
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:06,620
since we all have this understanding

473
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:08,210
when we're reviewing each other's code

474
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:11,150
reviews and code and pull requests that

475
00:21:11,150 --> 00:21:13,190
we know how to test accessibility for

476
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:16,429
everybody else those features too we've

477
00:21:16,429 --> 00:21:18,830
taken it one step further and we also

478
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:20,840
ensure that our designers know what

479
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:23,390
accessibility is and isn't and they

480
00:21:23,390 --> 00:21:24,830
provide things like the keyboard

481
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:26,990
interaction model for us so we can then

482
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:32,000
build it out we haven't are using our

483
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,559
internal design system has helped

484
00:21:33,559 --> 00:21:36,020
formalize a lot of best practices so

485
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:37,580
over the last year we've also conducted

486
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:40,370
a color audit to simplify and ensure

487
00:21:40,370 --> 00:21:44,720
that our smaller new set of colors meets

488
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,700
all of our contrast standards we've also

489
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:48,620
set up things like linters to prevent

490
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:51,409
folks from adding one-off colors this is

491
00:21:51,409 --> 00:21:52,520
just one of the steps that we've taken

492
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:54,890
to help prepare for one of the most

493
00:21:54,890 --> 00:21:57,169
requested features of slack dark mode so

494
00:21:57,169 --> 00:21:59,150
that once it does roll out

495
00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:00,740
we can ensure that it'll still be fully

496
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:05,510
accessible so having front Enders use a

497
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:07,490
centralized component library that is

498
00:22:07,490 --> 00:22:11,150
accessible by default is awesome we

499
00:22:11,150 --> 00:22:12,740
currently use these components and

500
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:15,470
nearly 75% of applicable areas of our

501
00:22:15,470 --> 00:22:16,760
code base and we're trying to increase

502
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:19,970
that steadily but the single most useful

503
00:22:19,970 --> 00:22:21,890
thing I've learned is that you need to

504
00:22:21,890 --> 00:22:24,320
consider accessibility as early on in

505
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:27,260
the process as possible because it's

506
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:29,150
easier to add the blueberries in before

507
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:33,530
you bake muffin somebody once said we

508
00:22:33,530 --> 00:22:36,679
also have a dedicated QA team to run

509
00:22:36,679 --> 00:22:38,420
throw checks before we launch a feature

510
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:40,820
and also you to utilize a third-party

511
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:42,920
service called Ultra who conduct an

512
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:47,120
audit as well so even if you don't have

513
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,429
the benefit of a component library or

514
00:22:49,429 --> 00:22:52,550
design system or QA team and you're so

515
00:22:52,550 --> 00:22:54,050
loads of working by yourself

516
00:22:54,050 --> 00:22:56,870
hopefully this starter kit is enough to

517
00:22:56,870 --> 00:22:59,420
get you learning to become your own

518
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:03,620
resident expert awesome so nice job

519
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:06,170
everybody you've learned a ton and I

520
00:23:06,170 --> 00:23:07,700
know that you're gonna apply all these

521
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:09,230
best practices once you're back in the

522
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:12,440
real world but I want you all to stop

523
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:14,360
for a minute and think about how you got

524
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:16,190
to where you're sitting here today in a

525
00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:18,309
conference room in Hawaii

526
00:23:18,309 --> 00:23:20,420
maybe you first heard about this

527
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:22,580
conference on Twitter and you thought it

528
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:25,220
sounded cool so you navigated onto their

529
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:28,130
website you really liked the lineup and

530
00:23:28,130 --> 00:23:29,630
the idea of learning JavaScript on a

531
00:23:29,630 --> 00:23:33,100
beach so of course we bought a ticket

532
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:37,250
then you went on to buy a cheapest plane

533
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:40,929
ticket possible to get yourself here and

534
00:23:40,929 --> 00:23:43,550
of course you asked all your friends for

535
00:23:43,550 --> 00:23:45,530
the best food recommendations so you

536
00:23:45,530 --> 00:23:47,360
knew where to go for pookay and local

537
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:50,530
moco once you were on the island a

538
00:23:50,530 --> 00:23:54,170
recent study in the UK found that nearly

539
00:23:54,170 --> 00:23:56,090
70 percent of their web sites were

540
00:23:56,090 --> 00:23:58,760
inaccessible so I want you to think

541
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:00,140
about all these websites you've touched

542
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:02,510
along the way just in one day and

543
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:04,760
imagine that every time you want to fill

544
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:06,920
out a form or even just browse and read

545
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:09,080
content you were hit with a javascript

546
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:12,720
error I've always found it

547
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,460
interesting that other engineering

548
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:16,650
professions have a lot more strict

549
00:24:16,650 --> 00:24:18,539
certifications that they have to undergo

550
00:24:18,539 --> 00:24:20,940
so think about civil engineers need to

551
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:22,710
be tested before they can build bridges

552
00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:24,270
and buildings to make sure that they're

553
00:24:24,270 --> 00:24:26,640
safe for humans and while I do not want

554
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,440
this type of gatekeeping behavior in our

555
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:30,690
industry I do want us to hold ourselves

556
00:24:30,690 --> 00:24:34,380
and each other more accountable to make

557
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:35,940
sure that we are responsible with our

558
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:37,500
code and that we are building an

559
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:39,059
internet that is safe for other humans

560
00:24:39,059 --> 00:24:43,530
to use to I hope that this is something

561
00:24:43,530 --> 00:24:45,690
that you remember once you're all back

562
00:24:45,690 --> 00:24:47,429
and you have a p.m. breathing down your

563
00:24:47,429 --> 00:24:51,030
neck about an upcoming deadline your

564
00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:53,610
peers are trusting your expertise in all

565
00:24:53,610 --> 00:24:55,380
things front end and that includes

566
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:57,419
knowing that for to have a complete web

567
00:24:57,419 --> 00:25:00,330
project it has to be accessible even

568
00:25:00,330 --> 00:25:01,770
though it takes a little bit more time

569
00:25:01,770 --> 00:25:04,470
upfront it'll save you infinitely long

570
00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:08,159
in the long run it's become more and

571
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:09,390
more apparent that there are no average

572
00:25:09,390 --> 00:25:12,780
users this is a myth instead we should

573
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:14,610
be designing for the extremes of human

574
00:25:14,610 --> 00:25:17,070
ability much like everything else and

575
00:25:17,070 --> 00:25:18,980
especially with Emily's talk earlier

576
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:21,450
prioritizing inclusivity and designing

577
00:25:21,450 --> 00:25:23,490
for the most marginalized groups

578
00:25:23,490 --> 00:25:25,470
actually makes a better experience for

579
00:25:25,470 --> 00:25:26,010
everyone

580
00:25:26,010 --> 00:25:29,700
I there are countless examples of this

581
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:31,320
too I'm not sure the last time you

582
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:33,210
enjoyed a video that had closed

583
00:25:33,210 --> 00:25:35,490
captioning or if you enjoy text

584
00:25:35,490 --> 00:25:36,929
messaging or any voice-activated

585
00:25:36,929 --> 00:25:38,880
software all of these have their roots

586
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:42,870
in assistive technology so I hope you'll

587
00:25:42,870 --> 00:25:44,940
take this as a sign that you too can

588
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:46,679
build for accessibility even if you're

589
00:25:46,679 --> 00:25:50,250
not an expert and if you want to get

590
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:51,750
stuck along the way or if you just want

591
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:52,500
to tell me about your favorite

592
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:54,750
accessibility bug you can find me at

593
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:56,400
fish on the internet or come find me

594
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,140
after the talk or if you want to come

595
00:25:58,140 --> 00:25:59,820
work it slack and build component

596
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:02,309
library things more than happy to hear

597
00:26:02,309 --> 00:26:04,200
about it thank you all for having me

598
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,610
thank you for the organizers for

599
00:26:05,610 --> 00:26:10,240
bringing us all here to cool look

600
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:10,890
you
