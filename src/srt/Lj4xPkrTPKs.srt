00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:12,660

hi I'm Mario has introduced my twitter

2
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:15,690
handle is this and that's my icon if you

3
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:18,900
know me from Twitter I read a JavaScript

4
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:20,939
at a company called scripto and I do not

5
00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:23,939
do this as a job I'm a web application

6
00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:26,910
engineer company called scripto I also

7
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:29,160
co-organized a meet-up in Brooklyn New

8
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,019
York called Brooklyn Jas and it's

9
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:34,710
interesting it's just happening as a

10
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:37,260
Thursday night right now in Brooklyn

11
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:38,850
joke so like I've been like getting a

12
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:40,710
lot of tweets it's our two year

13
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:43,410
University so it's really honor to be

14
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:45,360
here speaking about this Saturday is

15
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,930
gone flowering I also make textile with

16
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:51,239
JavaScript and that's what I am talking

17
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:54,809
today what do you mean by making textile

18
00:00:54,809 --> 00:00:55,890
with JavaScript

19
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:58,859
well that means my weekend desk look

20
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:02,160
like this computer in the middle yarns

21
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,060
and my knitting machine so the title of

22
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:07,979
the talk is electro knit pixel to

23
00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:10,200
textile and I'm going to explain like

24
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:14,010
how a digital photo image gets into

25
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:15,860
textile pattern - yeah

26
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:20,040
so as I mentioned I design and I get in

27
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:22,439
JavaScript so I'm going to explain a

28
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:23,790
little bit about knitting with

29
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:27,900
JavaScript part part first so here's a

30
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:30,689
little video of me operating a knitting

31
00:01:30,689 --> 00:01:34,439
machine so I wrote a code know the base

32
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:37,470
code to talk to this machine from 80s

33
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:39,930
this machine was developed in 80s or

34
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:44,490
it's been made since way way before time

35
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:47,399
and in 80s they made this knitting

36
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:49,590
machine that is a electro net which is

37
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:52,619
computerized knitting machine and this

38
00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:55,920
year I took on the project to figure out

39
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,219
how to talk to this machine from my

40
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:01,920
computer because this was an 1880s way

41
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,049
before Apple computer so it's designed

42
00:02:04,049 --> 00:02:07,560
to talk to a special module that gets a

43
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:10,950
frumpy discuss of data and then store

44
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:12,300
that they are actually

45
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:15,150
he plugs into your your TV monitor and

46
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:17,160
then you have a controller joystick to

47
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,920
program the patterns into it so I wanted

48
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,380
to do that from my computer a lot of

49
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:24,020
people have hacked on this so I

50
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:27,210
researched a lot of code written by

51
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:29,070
other language and I thought why not

52
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:32,180
JavaScript so I started doing this and

53
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:35,820
so as I mentioned it has a computer and

54
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:39,450
I presented at a J's Kampf us in May and

55
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:42,960
it's very nice to get to talk what came

56
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:45,540
after that a disease comes Asia in

57
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:50,760
Singapore so this is run by computer but

58
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:54,000
a model will be full disk knitting

59
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,730
machine was operated by punch guard much

60
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:59,400
like how all the computers were operated

61
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,980
by punch guard so right after I figure

62
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:04,020
out how to operate this machine I got

63
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:05,370
really interested in punch card

64
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:07,980
mechanism and I kind of like prototype

65
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:10,800
my own punch coil computer and program

66
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,200
that with johnny-five which is a Java

67
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:17,640
JavaScript robotics framework so what it

68
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,800
does is it takes the punch card it's a

69
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,830
huge punch card I designed it takes it

70
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:25,440
if there's a hole it won't push the pin

71
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,570
if there isn't the hole then it push the

72
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:29,940
pin and that gets the input of it and

73
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:33,660
this is kind of a little mock-up of a

74
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:35,790
web application that is designing the

75
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:42,690
textile by punch card input so this

76
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:45,840
whole thing about doing JavaScript and

77
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,780
knitting came when I actually was

78
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:51,810
studying JavaScript and to be able to

79
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:55,500
code I was another way before I became

80
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,930
engineer and I noticed that when I was

81
00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:00,980
learning JavaScript I I noticed that the

82
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:04,050
JavaScript is really like knitting or

83
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:07,050
coding is like knitting knitting atomic

84
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:09,450
unique for knitting is two stitches much

85
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:11,790
like computer is ones and zeros it's

86
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:13,980
knit stitch and purl stitch

87
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:16,260
and it creates a very different face of

88
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:18,810
the fabric and the combination of those

89
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:21,570
creates a calf of your sweater or

90
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:24,090
neckline or like a lab rat pattern in

91
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:26,550
there the code

92
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:29,699
or pattern for knitting the instruction

93
00:04:29,699 --> 00:04:33,090
to knit certain sweaters or scarf comes

94
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:36,960
in the form of code so that means you

95
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:40,889
can knit in JavaScript so first line of

96
00:04:40,889 --> 00:04:44,069
this instruction it's Co 5 meaning cast

97
00:04:44,069 --> 00:04:48,960
on 5 start a width of 5 which it's like

98
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,220
creating a new array of length 5 and

99
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:56,430
next one K 5 meaning like put 5 knit

100
00:04:56,430 --> 00:05:00,840
stitches into that array M 1 is make 1

101
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:03,900
so now you're expanding the size of the

102
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:06,750
array which is like operating a scarf

103
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:09,990
dot price method and there's much more

104
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:13,379
clear loop indication in knitting code

105
00:05:13,379 --> 00:05:17,400
or pattern knit until 2 stitches

106
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,860
remaining meaning much like wild loop

107
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:23,580
until there is a count of 2 just append

108
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:30,240
knit stitches into the array so now if

109
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:35,520
you can switch to this machine basically

110
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:41,880
this machine knit way faster than your

111
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:44,039
hand can knit it's doing the same thing

112
00:05:44,039 --> 00:05:45,719
it's appending the knit stitches inside

113
00:05:45,719 --> 00:05:49,620
it but it is going to do it way faster

114
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:52,139
than you can do so in stuff feed switch

115
00:05:52,139 --> 00:05:58,590
to the camera yeah if not I can show the

116
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:02,250
video

117
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:06,220
can we focus the camera to the knitting

118
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:13,350
machine instead of the slides to video

119
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:16,660
maybe technical difficulties welcome

120
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:20,140
back to right Linda you're here all

121
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:20,560
right

122
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,920
so as you can see if you can focus on

123
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:28,600
this area this is a width of 60 array to

124
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:33,880
me and when you pull this handle it

125
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:38,740
knits a 100 fabric and to me this is

126
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:41,770
much like leading LA and not appending

127
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:45,400
into the matrix so you can see this is

128
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:49,900
creating one wall by wall needing a

129
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:52,420
little by little but if you have knit

130
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:54,700
this is way faster than you do at a

131
00:06:54,700 --> 00:07:05,290
heart so can you switch to the slide so

132
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:07,810
now I figure out how to talk to this

133
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:10,090
machine put the data in and then knit

134
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:12,070
and I started knitting and I thought

135
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:14,860
instead of just taking an image it'll be

136
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:18,100
cool if I can JavaScript to make actual

137
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:21,250
image too so I started doing this nerdy

138
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:24,990
knit project first I did a cleaning a d3

139
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:28,450
visualization and exporting it as a

140
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:31,510
image and put it into the machine so

141
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:34,720
that the pattern for this scarf is

142
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:38,950
actually made by JavaScript the other

143
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:41,560
project that I did was a creating a

144
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,840
domain specific language for knitting so

145
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:46,660
again this is written in JavaScript web

146
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:49,420
application the raw parser is learning

147
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:54,670
made by pictures I can type and change

148
00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:58,720
the pattern interactively and then you

149
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:03,370
download and then load it in the other

150
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:06,580
one I did was a one day somebody from

151
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:08,770
Travis CI tweeted that they had a API

152
00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:11,380
outage and they had this beautiful

153
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:15,440
or maybe sad glass of their day

154
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:18,170
dropping down and somebody not knowing

155
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:19,550
anything about what I do

156
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:21,320
tweet it that it'll be great if I can

157
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:23,960
make a scarf out of it my friend if you

158
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:26,240
knew I do JavaScript knitting tweet it

159
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,800
at me saying like maybe you can make

160
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:31,040
this and I was like I totally can so I

161
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,960
made it and then send it to Germany

162
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:36,860
office of a travesty I so though this

163
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:39,020
thing kind of things JavaScript through

164
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:40,909
and through cleaning the image put it

165
00:08:40,909 --> 00:08:44,570
into the machine is what I do a lot of I

166
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:46,550
started after I figured out how to use

167
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:48,590
this machine and how to hack on it I

168
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:50,330
started making a lot of knitwear and

169
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:52,190
then there was a lot of friction and

170
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:55,100
friction was using Photoshop just the

171
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:57,200
color image is not automatically

172
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,180
loadable to machine I have to do a lot

173
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:01,070
of image processing and I was using

174
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:03,920
Photoshop but I was like hey why not do

175
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,500
it in JavaScript right image processing

176
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:09,380
doing JavaScript if you think about

177
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:11,510
image processing you immediate to me I

178
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:13,340
immediately think oh maybe I should

179
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:15,230
learn a language see or using a

180
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:19,400
framework like open CV but I'm a kind of

181
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,530
developer who started making button

182
00:09:21,530 --> 00:09:24,040
smooth by JavaScript I didn't go to a

183
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:27,650
computer science College I just started

184
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:29,810
making websites and then learn to code

185
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:33,710
so javascript is pretty much my choice

186
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:36,650
of language in but what I do so let's do

187
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:39,320
this in JavaScript right so the process

188
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:42,380
of making a color image into this

189
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:44,990
machine is three steps first you need to

190
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:47,420
get a lasso graphics which I will

191
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,460
explain what it is in a minute and then

192
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:51,380
do image processing whether you want to

193
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:54,170
change the color or invert the color do

194
00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:56,780
whatever you want and then that step is

195
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:58,850
making it to one bit bitmap image which

196
00:09:58,850 --> 00:10:02,150
I will explain but what it means is that

197
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:05,839
just compressing the data so that it is

198
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:08,600
representable by just two colors or even

199
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:11,330
one color color or no color because my

200
00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:13,610
machine only takes two color of yarn

201
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:16,550
it is not a web-safe color variety of

202
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:20,780
you know yarns right so let's start the

203
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:23,600
last three graphics what does that mean

204
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,720
NIDA Laster graphic well the last thing

205
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,370
I think is best explained by a

206
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:32,089
collection of pixels so this is my movie

207
00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:34,490
that I took from using a color picker

208
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:36,860
you can see the magnified version of the

209
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:41,089
texture each pixel has a color data so

210
00:10:41,089 --> 00:10:45,139
you can think that the name is levy like

211
00:10:45,139 --> 00:10:48,920
a pixel art the stitch cannot be bent

212
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:52,190
from point A to B by making straight

213
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:54,589
line I have to draw a line saying like

214
00:10:54,589 --> 00:10:59,300
the left left up left left up so you can

215
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:00,920
think of the last two image as like a

216
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:03,800
collection of pixels information the one

217
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:06,079
that's the opposite of blaster is a

218
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:08,959
vector like what I explained you it's

219
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:11,569
like a SVG you define I want line from

220
00:11:11,569 --> 00:11:14,720
point A to point B but that's not how

221
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:18,050
knitting works so you need a Laster so I

222
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:19,759
need to get a last two image right

223
00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:21,889
collection of image but like what do you

224
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:23,990
mean by like getting a data out of image

225
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:25,970
like I only know like using image tag

226
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:28,550
and I've never liked Leonard a picture

227
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:32,329
pixel by pixel how do I do that well

228
00:11:32,329 --> 00:11:34,519
actually you can do it as a JavaScript

229
00:11:34,519 --> 00:11:38,000
engineer using canvas of html5 you

230
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,949
create a compass and assume that you

231
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:42,199
loaded some kind of image into this

232
00:11:42,199 --> 00:11:46,009
canvas and you use a get image data

233
00:11:46,009 --> 00:11:50,240
method to get a array of numbers and

234
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,329
this is a flat LA of numbers which start

235
00:11:53,329 --> 00:11:58,209
from the top pixel corner of 1 1 X 1 Y

236
00:11:58,209 --> 00:12:01,430
RGB red green and blue value and then

237
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:04,639
the alpha opacity so if you do the CSS

238
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:07,970
color in LGB a you or much familiar with

239
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:10,939
this format it's basically a flat array

240
00:12:10,939 --> 00:12:14,089
of all the pixel information of that

241
00:12:14,089 --> 00:12:19,130
image so now I have a data that means I

242
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:22,220
can emulate in canvas how computer

243
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:26,420
displays an image and i padded the LA so

244
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:28,160
that it's a little a lot easier to read

245
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,069
so you let's clear our output canvas

246
00:12:31,069 --> 00:12:33,889
objects another one to have fun with it

247
00:12:33,889 --> 00:12:36,410
and clear a function of draw draw

248
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:37,250
function gets

249
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:39,500
like holiness of the pixel and then

250
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:42,020
three colors to represent that pixel and

251
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:44,240
every time this function is called you

252
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:47,350
append a colored rectangle into the

253
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:51,290
canvas object so first one is blue which

254
00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:54,340
is red is zero

255
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:59,170
gleen is 43 blue is 125 and opacity of

256
00:12:59,170 --> 00:13:02,420
no paucity lady and then you get lighter

257
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:05,120
blue lighter blue the next one is yellow

258
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:08,090
and yellow so this is how computer

259
00:13:08,090 --> 00:13:10,760
lenders image based on the pixel data

260
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:14,540
that you can get from the canvas so that

261
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:16,340
means you can manipulate or life

262
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:18,170
intercept this draw function and then

263
00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:19,010
have fun with it

264
00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:21,320
so let's invert the color inverting the

265
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:24,230
color is flipping the the value so

266
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:28,070
basically you get a red green and blue

267
00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:31,520
value subtract it from 255 and then use

268
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:34,130
that number instead so you do that and

269
00:13:34,130 --> 00:13:37,940
then get the inverted image Joe maybe

270
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:40,910
you can just increase the value of just

271
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:44,060
a blue color in that case you add in

272
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:46,850
this demo I edit the 60 and then glue

273
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:49,990
gets blue R and yellow gets less yellow

274
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:53,870
you can also grayscale an image and I

275
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:56,720
use very simple algorithm to do by

276
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,670
scaling gray scaling there's a many way

277
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:01,010
to do it though the way I'm doing it is

278
00:14:01,010 --> 00:14:03,260
not the most accurate to the human eye

279
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:06,680
but my clay scale image what eventually

280
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:09,500
goes into this two color and fabric so I

281
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:12,950
don't need II need sophisticated I'll

282
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:15,620
going to do it so the way to do it or

283
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:18,800
the way how you do it is you get a color

284
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:22,839
RGB value you find the largest value in

285
00:14:22,839 --> 00:14:26,300
those LGB repeat that four three times

286
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:29,720
and then you get grayscale the color so

287
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:32,630
now you manipulated the color let's do

288
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:34,460
something more fun like let's blur a

289
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:37,280
photo or sharpen the photo or let's find

290
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,839
the edge because sometimes I take a

291
00:14:38,839 --> 00:14:41,089
photo of something and I only want to

292
00:14:41,089 --> 00:14:43,730
represent the outline of the thing and I

293
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:46,820
load it into Photoshop and draw the line

294
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:49,580
from that object to get the thing but if

295
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:50,209
I can

296
00:14:50,209 --> 00:14:52,449
do it and automatically that'll be cool

297
00:14:52,449 --> 00:14:55,490
in order to do that all three of them

298
00:14:55,490 --> 00:14:57,470
use the same method called kernel

299
00:14:57,470 --> 00:14:59,689
convolution but I like to call it as a

300
00:14:59,689 --> 00:15:02,209
pixel social water and it really is a

301
00:15:02,209 --> 00:15:06,860
friendship between pixels so you get an

302
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:09,199
image again I'm using a gray scale

303
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:11,959
because grayscale image again only has a

304
00:15:11,959 --> 00:15:14,089
one value per pax also it's easier for

305
00:15:14,089 --> 00:15:16,759
demo if you want to do it in color you

306
00:15:16,759 --> 00:15:18,589
just repeat it three times across

307
00:15:18,589 --> 00:15:23,089
LGV again each pixel has one color on

308
00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:26,319
one number you introduce this idea of

309
00:15:26,319 --> 00:15:28,819
convolution and kernel but I'd like to

310
00:15:28,819 --> 00:15:32,029
think it as a pixel social graph so this

311
00:15:32,029 --> 00:15:36,529
the center is you you are the kernel you

312
00:15:36,529 --> 00:15:38,749
give number to yourself how valuable you

313
00:15:38,749 --> 00:15:41,089
are the surrounding pixels are your

314
00:15:41,089 --> 00:15:43,100
friends and you also give a number to

315
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:45,709
France how valuable they are so you get

316
00:15:45,709 --> 00:15:48,050
to choose like I like this like a

317
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:51,439
left-hand guy too and then later on size

318
00:15:51,439 --> 00:15:53,929
three you can choose your friendship

319
00:15:53,929 --> 00:15:57,259
right it's basically how much of your

320
00:15:57,259 --> 00:15:59,149
friend or which corner of your friend

321
00:15:59,149 --> 00:16:03,049
you let affects you more you over way

322
00:16:03,049 --> 00:16:05,660
that invisible window there so let's

323
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:08,720
look at this kernel 134 and we're going

324
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:12,920
to figure out what to change right start

325
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:13,759
from the corner

326
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:16,579
you take actual value of the pixel and

327
00:16:16,579 --> 00:16:20,929
then multiply by the the friendships

328
00:16:20,929 --> 00:16:23,329
level that you define so in this case 1

329
00:16:23,329 --> 00:16:26,569
so it stays as 159 next one is 2 so

330
00:16:26,569 --> 00:16:30,949
doubled into 72 next one status 63 and

331
00:16:30,949 --> 00:16:33,499
then you do that for Hall 9 pixels and

332
00:16:33,499 --> 00:16:36,579
then get the total of 2061

333
00:16:36,579 --> 00:16:40,249
you divide it by the total amount in

334
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:44,449
this convolution or your social graph

335
00:16:44,449 --> 00:16:47,600
divide it by that and then you get 28 so

336
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,420
next time you lender draw image you use

337
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:54,589
28 at 128 instead of 134 you do that for

338
00:16:54,589 --> 00:16:59,029
every single pixel this 190 gets 80 42

339
00:16:59,029 --> 00:17:02,269
gets 54 you do that every single one and

340
00:17:02,269 --> 00:17:03,460
then you can

341
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:06,760
get a image processed data so let's look

342
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:10,209
at some of the effects so the social

343
00:17:10,209 --> 00:17:12,610
graph that we used in the example

344
00:17:12,610 --> 00:17:15,730
creates a blur maybe it's a little

345
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:18,670
harder to see but you can see that the

346
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:21,790
photo is blurring blur function is not

347
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:24,280
only to make image fuzzy it's a way to

348
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:27,069
get a little noise so if you have a

349
00:17:27,069 --> 00:17:29,350
noisy photo you can blur it and then

350
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:31,690
sharpen it again and to get the make us

351
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:35,950
goose photo next one you decide your

352
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:37,840
friends are a little more negative than

353
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:41,679
you are right your top down there five

354
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:44,650
friends or minus 1 and then the diagonal

355
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:47,860
corner so 0 that gets you a sharp edge

356
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:52,830
so you can see that before head after

357
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:56,170
the next one is edge detection so this

358
00:17:56,170 --> 00:17:58,210
time you are really valuable but your

359
00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:01,030
friends are not right and instead of

360
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:03,160
dividing by total sum of the number this

361
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:06,520
time you divide it by number of pixel or

362
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08,380
the size of the matrix so this time 9

363
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:12,760
divided by 9 you get a line from the

364
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,890
picture may be a little hard to see it

365
00:18:14,890 --> 00:18:18,850
but you can see it so doing this was

366
00:18:18,850 --> 00:18:21,370
leaving slow because remember just

367
00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:23,380
joining the picture is number of pixels

368
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:26,740
but then you added the computation 9

369
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:30,309
more time to calculate what this value

370
00:18:30,309 --> 00:18:33,429
would be so I was like can I make this

371
00:18:33,429 --> 00:18:38,320
like pattern yes you can with web

372
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:38,770
workers

373
00:18:38,770 --> 00:18:40,600
what do you mean parallel with the

374
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,730
workers way JavaScript this thing was

375
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:43,120
ready

376
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:46,030
what web worker is magic thing and that

377
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:47,860
lives in browser that I did not know

378
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:51,429
until now it's a piece of JavaScript

379
00:18:51,429 --> 00:18:54,400
that lands on the background separate it

380
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:57,280
from your browser's J's thread so you

381
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,800
can hands on the data into Volker Jas

382
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,990
and while Walker Jas is doing heavy

383
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:04,900
computation it will not block your UI

384
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:06,780
being animated

385
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:10,090
so worker from now on the few slides are

386
00:19:10,090 --> 00:19:12,250
about web worker so if you know you can

387
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:14,320
just you know skip it

388
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:17,770
so you start you you make a new worker

389
00:19:17,770 --> 00:19:20,470
by new worker and then get a pass to the

390
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:26,350
worker ejs the hosts JavaScript and the

391
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:30,160
Walker JavaScript talks in the method

392
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:33,160
called post message and each of them has

393
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:36,040
event code a on message and listening to

394
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:42,309
the post message fired post message have

395
00:19:42,309 --> 00:19:44,860
one argument so if you want to pass many

396
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:47,049
many data like in this case I am passing

397
00:19:47,049 --> 00:19:50,200
ID and data you needed to put it into

398
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:52,240
the JavaScript just so that the argument

399
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:56,799
is one worker je s can be multiplied so

400
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:59,350
that you are parallel processing in that

401
00:19:59,350 --> 00:20:00,429
case hostia

402
00:20:00,429 --> 00:20:03,190
starts as one but then you fire up many

403
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:06,790
work as many workers you want so in my

404
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:09,429
case i divided up my image into multiple

405
00:20:09,429 --> 00:20:13,030
workers get just this area for worker

406
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:16,450
one of the data and passing it into a

407
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:20,140
workers and doing it it made it faster

408
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:22,780
however this is not a magic function for

409
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:27,010
everything the trick is you are passing

410
00:20:27,010 --> 00:20:29,290
and copying a data every time you fire

411
00:20:29,290 --> 00:20:32,770
up the worker so this data part data

412
00:20:32,770 --> 00:20:35,770
part you're passing copying the data so

413
00:20:35,770 --> 00:20:37,240
if you're doing a simple thing and

414
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:39,429
copying the data takes more than your

415
00:20:39,429 --> 00:20:41,350
computation of simple simple computation

416
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:44,530
it gets actually slower than just doing

417
00:20:44,530 --> 00:20:47,200
it in the single process so this is kind

418
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:47,950
of give-and-take

419
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:49,270
but if you have leaving heavy

420
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:51,460
computation work web workers makes it

421
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:55,240
faster so we covered what the last

422
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:57,490
graphic is and then how to do the image

423
00:20:57,490 --> 00:20:59,380
processing on the data from last er

424
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:01,780
graphic let's talk about how to make it

425
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:03,910
into two colors so that I can represent

426
00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:08,260
it into yarn you can start from color

427
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:10,150
image but in that case you needed to

428
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:12,940
make it to grayscale first the grayscale

429
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:14,890
image you may think it is black and

430
00:21:14,890 --> 00:21:16,870
white photography so it's already late

431
00:21:16,870 --> 00:21:17,919
already

432
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:20,350
liddie for two colors but in fact

433
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:24,130
grayscale image is a white pixel black

434
00:21:24,130 --> 00:21:26,260
pistol and many shades of grey in

435
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:29,350
between so I absolutely need two colors

436
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:32,110
like this one way to do it it's

437
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:34,450
breathing in half or put the threshold

438
00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:37,870
somewhere and anything over then that

439
00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:39,880
number gets white when seeing less than

440
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:43,030
that number gets black and you get image

441
00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:45,669
like this this works very well if you're

442
00:21:45,669 --> 00:21:47,650
dealing with logo data or graphics data

443
00:21:47,650 --> 00:21:49,179
not a photography

444
00:21:49,179 --> 00:21:52,390
sadly you can see the definition of the

445
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:55,380
lion male on gets you know washed away

446
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:58,690
in order to preserve that like what

447
00:21:58,690 --> 00:22:00,880
newspaper does you need to do things

448
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:05,260
called dithering this ring start again

449
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:08,080
with image data that you get from

450
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:11,230
greyscale image well each pixel gets one

451
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:15,280
number you apply a noise matrix or

452
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:18,549
detering matrix and over where you

453
00:22:18,549 --> 00:22:20,770
compare the under pixel and then the

454
00:22:20,770 --> 00:22:24,820
overlaid pixel value if it's lower the

455
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:27,460
the image input is lower than the desert

456
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:30,159
matrix it gets white if it's over then

457
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:32,320
it gets black and you can we present

458
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:36,790
that in 1 and 0 1 bit image so the

459
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:39,309
output of that would look like this so

460
00:22:39,309 --> 00:22:41,350
you may think this is grey from fallback

461
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:43,900
but this is actually represented in just

462
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:47,770
white and black pixels and that way I

463
00:22:47,770 --> 00:22:50,020
can use two yarns to the present this

464
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:54,460
image so once I figure that out I was

465
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:57,120
like okay I can make I can automate my

466
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,559
process to create an image for this

467
00:22:59,559 --> 00:23:04,090
knitting machine I can save that data in

468
00:23:04,090 --> 00:23:06,130
some kind of JSON or something because

469
00:23:06,130 --> 00:23:08,290
up until now it is just an array of

470
00:23:08,290 --> 00:23:10,360
information right I'm just using that a

471
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:12,070
layer of information to lender on my

472
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:14,620
screen not as an image can i download

473
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:16,690
that as an image file because it's a lot

474
00:23:16,690 --> 00:23:19,659
easier and portable to keep track of it

475
00:23:19,659 --> 00:23:21,250
should be able to do that right because

476
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:23,230
we download image from web all the time

477
00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:28,450
so my thinking was that okay I know the

478
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:32,770
the type of well the the what do you

479
00:23:32,770 --> 00:23:33,790
call it

480
00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:38,440
the type of the the la that the canvas

481
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:40,750
object takes so let's create that I have

482
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:42,670
one zero one zero but then converted

483
00:23:42,670 --> 00:23:47,380
into 255 255 255 Pasadena 255 pixel and

484
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:50,800
then 0 0 0 255 pixel create a new canvas

485
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:53,860
object put that data into canvas and

486
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:57,280
then once it's in canvas you can use to

487
00:23:57,280 --> 00:24:01,540
data URL to get a base64 representation

488
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:03,670
of that image and then you can just put

489
00:24:03,670 --> 00:24:05,140
it into your L and then download the

490
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:09,030
image however this did not work

491
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:11,860
specifically dispar did not work and

492
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:16,690
this part what's the problem it was not

493
00:24:16,690 --> 00:24:19,750
just updating the data and I was looking

494
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:22,240
at this inspector and why is it not

495
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:24,820
doing this because it's la because I

496
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:26,590
assumed that it's la because it came

497
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:30,160
back in you know square bracket looking

498
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:33,880
closely into it this was something code

499
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:37,060
you need a clumped array and I was like

500
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:41,290
what is that what is that I mean I have

501
00:24:41,290 --> 00:24:44,680
never seen this thing in my inspector

502
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:46,450
before I mean granted I was in the game

503
00:24:46,450 --> 00:24:48,340
developer I wasn't dealing there's a lot

504
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:52,120
of compass at all but like what this

505
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:54,610
thing is called typed array and first of

506
00:24:54,610 --> 00:24:57,850
all typed it's JavaScript it's not typed

507
00:24:57,850 --> 00:25:01,240
what do you mean type well let's talk

508
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:02,020
about JavaScript

509
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:03,660
all right first so they can overlay

510
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:06,640
there's a magical saying that takes any

511
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:09,280
type of information put it into one

512
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:12,520
collection right so you can clear la you

513
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:15,490
put you specify index and put the one or

514
00:25:15,490 --> 00:25:19,720
push two or you can push the object or

515
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:22,360
string and then the output of it looks

516
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:26,650
like this the JavaScript la to me is

517
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:29,020
like a baking tray that you put in and

518
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:31,030
then it takes like anything any shape

519
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:33,400
any size if you want to bake a chicken

520
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,890
right next to a snow summer law you can

521
00:25:35,890 --> 00:25:38,410
also do that too so it's like very very

522
00:25:38,410 --> 00:25:41,260
useful thing but it needs to expect a

523
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:43,180
lot of possibility when it's doing the

524
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:45,940
computation the time delay to me is a

525
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:46,970
muffin tin

526
00:25:46,970 --> 00:25:49,640
it is very specifically designed and

527
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:53,539
very specific size to hold specific

528
00:25:53,539 --> 00:25:56,150
thing weight it can be muffin tin it can

529
00:25:56,150 --> 00:25:59,270
be donut mold it can be I don't know but

530
00:25:59,270 --> 00:26:01,370
you know the the factory makes it

531
00:26:01,370 --> 00:26:03,710
specific product or specific shape in

532
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:08,000
size so that's type terrain so type

533
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,120
array the size and shape is defined in

534
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:14,960
this part so you need a meaning a bit of

535
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:21,340
unsigned integer so that means you put

536
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:24,559
anything you put has to be a bit

537
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:27,799
unsigned integer if you put more than 8

538
00:26:27,799 --> 00:26:31,340
bit so a bit is 0 to 255 if you put more

539
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:35,450
than 255 then it will just hold over fro

540
00:26:35,450 --> 00:26:38,720
from that if you put anything that is

541
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:41,299
not integer like string it will just not

542
00:26:41,299 --> 00:26:43,970
put it in there for you it just stays as

543
00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:47,120
0 and if you put a number that's within

544
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:50,419
then it will just keep that number so

545
00:26:50,419 --> 00:26:53,539
here is a list of typed array and what I

546
00:26:53,539 --> 00:26:55,880
specifically need it was you need a

547
00:26:55,880 --> 00:27:01,030
clumped array 8-bit unsigned integer

548
00:27:01,030 --> 00:27:05,450
parenthesis crumped no explanation what

549
00:27:05,450 --> 00:27:09,380
does that mean so I did a little bit of

550
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:13,970
search and clumped means is that any all

551
00:27:13,970 --> 00:27:15,559
the rights from the machine just cut it

552
00:27:15,559 --> 00:27:19,010
off it has to be exactly the same size

553
00:27:19,010 --> 00:27:21,710
within this defined range so you need

554
00:27:21,710 --> 00:27:24,890
eight again so 0 to 255 anything more

555
00:27:24,890 --> 00:27:25,520
than that

556
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:28,250
it's get 255 anything less than that

557
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:30,860
gets 0 so if you assign 280

558
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:34,640
then naked 255 and if you assign minus

559
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:35,120
30

560
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:40,120
it gets zero this does good thing when

561
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:44,179
computer is only expecting one thing and

562
00:27:44,179 --> 00:27:45,620
doesn't have to think about many other

563
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:48,049
possibility the computation gets faster

564
00:27:48,049 --> 00:27:50,320
and that's part of the web browser that

565
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:53,000
enabling a lot of games and things that

566
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:58,039
we feel like it's native so I modify my

567
00:27:58,039 --> 00:28:00,570
code one thing is that the type

568
00:28:00,570 --> 00:28:03,389
doesn't have same method as the legal

569
00:28:03,389 --> 00:28:06,120
array so you can't do the push so i

570
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:09,690
specifically define the index and then

571
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:11,850
assign the value from my base array and

572
00:28:11,850 --> 00:28:14,159
I was able to download it so at the end

573
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:17,279
of this exercise or journey that I was

574
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:19,320
doing I was like surprisingly I just

575
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:21,059
wanted to knit but then I learned a lot

576
00:28:21,059 --> 00:28:24,360
about web by just knitting and I really

577
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:27,559
recommend doing that all the things I

578
00:28:27,559 --> 00:28:29,850
was a web developer I was in the

579
00:28:29,850 --> 00:28:33,000
hardware hacker I just wanted to do fun

580
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,639
project with JavaScript and I learn how

581
00:28:35,639 --> 00:28:37,620
to talk to machines I learned how to

582
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:40,529
what the clumped array is around what

583
00:28:40,529 --> 00:28:42,389
live poker is and like from now on

584
00:28:42,389 --> 00:28:46,500
whenever I see opportunity in my web

585
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:49,320
application coding I totally gonna use

586
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:52,769
the web worker and clump dice right so

587
00:28:52,769 --> 00:28:55,409
my like my suggestion is that like if

588
00:28:55,409 --> 00:28:57,360
you think and you think that you like

589
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:00,750
and possibly compute it by computer you

590
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:03,690
should try it and I promise you that you

591
00:29:03,690 --> 00:29:05,700
will learn something new that you can

592
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:08,940
use in daily life so here's a few

593
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:13,230
resources of my project so right now the

594
00:29:13,230 --> 00:29:14,909
loading the data into machine and

595
00:29:14,909 --> 00:29:17,460
creating images to separate project but

596
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:19,559
I'm creating a one application so that

597
00:29:19,559 --> 00:29:22,049
on the UI just you click on it and then

598
00:29:22,049 --> 00:29:24,870
load it into machine so that code will

599
00:29:24,870 --> 00:29:28,320
be up on the repo I specifically like to

600
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,659
think it's like Lieberman and go for

601
00:29:30,659 --> 00:29:32,429
poetic computation if you let me sit in

602
00:29:32,429 --> 00:29:34,679
there pixel class um that's where I

603
00:29:34,679 --> 00:29:38,070
learned a lot of image processing so

604
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:40,289
thank you that's my twitter handle if

605
00:29:40,289 --> 00:29:41,909
you have any question please tweet at me

606
00:29:41,909 --> 00:29:46,019
or DM me and I have a feedback form on

607
00:29:46,019 --> 00:29:49,919
where bitly slash chicks alternate if

608
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:51,690
you like the talk or didn't like the

609
00:29:51,690 --> 00:29:54,330
talk I would love your feedback thank

610
00:29:54,330 --> 00:29:55,649
you so much thank you
