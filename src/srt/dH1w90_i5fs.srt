00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:13,120

[Music]

2
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:15,960
everyone how are you doing hopefully not

3
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:20,490
too hungover cool so my name is Alyssa

4
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:24,420
and I'm here today to according to J's

5
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:27,869
comp aja spilled some tasty beans on

6
00:00:27,869 --> 00:00:30,539
vote voting I still don't know it's

7
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:32,430
filling some tasty beans actually means

8
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:39,059
but you'll see okay so who am i yeah

9
00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:42,840
okay that's my intro done okay I make

10
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:43,920
sure we from the commercial software

11
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,559
engineering team in Microsoft so what we

12
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:48,840
do is we work with enterprise and

13
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,300
startup developers just like you guys to

14
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:54,570
build epic stuff so this is my twitter

15
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:56,730
handle if you want to like shown any

16
00:00:56,730 --> 00:00:59,969
questions during my talk alright so on

17
00:00:59,969 --> 00:01:02,550
the menu today I'm just gonna more

18
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:04,860
specifically cover these different

19
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:07,799
things so let's start with a simple

20
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:10,470
gentle introduction into what sports and

21
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:14,430
an LP okay so whose try to bought or try

22
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:18,570
to build on before okay

23
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:21,990
maybe fifty percent of you so in the

24
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:26,220
middle of 2016 around that time I think

25
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:28,200
Facebook released their messenger API

26
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,780
platform and a lot of companies started

27
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:33,180
getting real for more about you know

28
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:35,820
having chat interfaces or an engine to

29
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:38,130
build chat interfaces so it suddenly

30
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:40,439
became like really cool so have a small

31
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:43,880
little app that lives in your messenger

32
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:48,210
so yeah a tripod is a service that you

33
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:50,299
interact with by a chat interface and

34
00:01:50,299 --> 00:01:54,119
this is common misconception that your

35
00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:56,280
bot can only be smart oh it's a good boy

36
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,689
only if you use natural language

37
00:01:57,689 --> 00:02:01,250
processing which is NLP but to be honest

38
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:04,380
that's a myth if your bot is badly

39
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:06,630
designed NOP is not going to save it you

40
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:08,580
can put makeup on a potato but it's no

41
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:15,690
potato okay so what about NLP natural

42
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:18,150
language processing it's a form of

43
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:20,150
machine learning text classification

44
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:23,010
specifically and it it involves you

45
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:25,349
trying to understand what your user is

46
00:02:25,349 --> 00:02:28,560
trying to do so I think universally

47
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,900
there's these two main concepts that

48
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,400
have been adopted across all the

49
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,379
different chat engine platforms and

50
00:02:34,379 --> 00:02:37,940
that's intent and entities okay so

51
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:40,379
intent is what a user is trying to do

52
00:02:40,379 --> 00:02:42,840
and then entity is the important data

53
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,580
within what your user says that's

54
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:47,190
important so for example I want a chili

55
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:48,930
crab which is great in Singapore by the

56
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:51,180
way and sell it those are your two food

57
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:56,250
entities all right okay so how do you go

58
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:58,290
about making one I'm not gonna tell you

59
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:00,150
that do it the Microsoft way or the

60
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:00,530
highway

61
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:03,540
that's a ton of different ways you can

62
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:06,450
make a bot so dialogue flow is from

63
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:10,140
Google they acquired a Pio a I if you

64
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:11,580
guys didn't know that which from

65
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:13,440
Facebook that's IBM Watson and even

66
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:17,430
bought kit from howdy but today my demos

67
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:20,069
are gonna be using the Microsoft bought

68
00:03:20,069 --> 00:03:21,659
frameworks nodejs

69
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:26,730
SDK seeing as this is a J's conf so I'm

70
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:29,069
hoping that a lot of the concepts that I

71
00:03:29,069 --> 00:03:32,760
talk about today can be sort of used in

72
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:35,750
your boss no matter what framework use

73
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:41,010
okay can someone tell me what is well

74
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:43,409
what I'm sorry well that's a bot and

75
00:03:43,409 --> 00:03:47,780
then have in common like a mobile web it

76
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:50,040
no takers okay

77
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:52,709
building one is easy building a good one

78
00:03:52,709 --> 00:03:54,720
isn't okay

79
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,239
so rule number one when you start

80
00:03:57,239 --> 00:03:59,340
thinking about designing your bot it's

81
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:03,060
really important to remember that bots

82
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:05,099
aren't mobile web apps okay and you're

83
00:04:05,099 --> 00:04:06,959
probably thinking like I woke up on a

84
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:08,909
Saturday morning just to hear on someone

85
00:04:08,909 --> 00:04:11,970
tell me this okay but what I really mean

86
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:14,189
is that there are a whole different

87
00:04:14,189 --> 00:04:16,979
interface okay your users are gonna

88
00:04:16,979 --> 00:04:18,750
perceive things and they're gonna behave

89
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:22,439
super differently

90
00:04:22,449 --> 00:04:25,220
so I wonder illustrate in the straight

91
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:26,900
this with a project that I did recently

92
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:29,930
with a startup company out there based

93
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:33,259
in Singapore they are over a year old

94
00:04:33,259 --> 00:04:36,259
and they have 24,000 users using the app

95
00:04:36,259 --> 00:04:41,660
and what that app does is it helps you

96
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:43,400
solve math questions okay I wish this

97
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:43,820
one

98
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:45,530
I wish I had this when I wasn't doing so

99
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:48,169
well in math in high school but never

100
00:04:48,169 --> 00:04:51,020
mind so what you do is you snap a photo

101
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:54,620
of your question and then what it does

102
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:58,130
is use machine learning to understand

103
00:04:58,130 --> 00:05:00,199
what's in the question to give you

104
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:02,990
similar questions as well as any

105
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:05,750
suggested readings on concepts that are

106
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:08,180
inside the question and because their

107
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:11,539
user base is primarily secondary school

108
00:05:11,539 --> 00:05:15,010
students which is between maybe 13 to 16

109
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:17,539
what they wanted to do is create this

110
00:05:17,539 --> 00:05:21,560
tutor that's you know like a personal

111
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:24,490
tutor to engage their target audience so

112
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:27,110
what they wanted to do was to convert

113
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:30,740
their app into a bot and the problem

114
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:32,770
with thinking about it this way is that

115
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:36,220
you start to get and experienced it

116
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:42,860
isn't you know it isn't that good okay

117
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:44,930
so this is kind of like the app you send

118
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:48,740
in a photo and then it actually asks you

119
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:50,900
do you wanna see similar questions or

120
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:52,490
relevant topics which is similar to what

121
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:56,870
you see in the app as well okay so what

122
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:58,760
we did is we spend a week sitting down

123
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:01,940
with them and sort of revamping the UI

124
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:05,229
so before I go into the design

125
00:06:05,229 --> 00:06:08,240
considerations that we put into this let

126
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:12,390
me just show you the v2 that they have

127
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,020
so there's actually sort of a proper

128
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:19,010
menu telling users what they can do and

129
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:20,780
this is using the cards which are

130
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:22,310
facebook Messenger actually provides you

131
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:26,960
with and users actually know how you

132
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,909
know what kind of images they can they

133
00:06:28,909 --> 00:06:31,639
can upload to the bottom so I'm doing

134
00:06:31,639 --> 00:06:32,400
this

135
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,580
and as you can see it will just

136
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:38,940
immediately display similar questions

137
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:41,160
I like the ball it's really quirky and

138
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:45,300
it has a lot of fun stuff inside and

139
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:47,040
then you can view irrelevant topics

140
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:50,660
about the questions as well cool

141
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:54,300
so okay we will use this as an example

142
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:56,660
to talk about the design considerations

143
00:06:56,660 --> 00:07:00,389
there's two main sort of categories that

144
00:07:00,389 --> 00:07:02,850
I will put this in one is managing your

145
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:05,190
users actions and the second one is

146
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:07,740
managing the way your board displays

147
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:10,320
things to the user so managing user

148
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,990
actions when you start the conversation

149
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:15,330
just immediately tell the user what you

150
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:17,010
can do for them okay and the user should

151
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:19,470
be able to just you know go in and just

152
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:20,330
do it

153
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:24,030
secondly at every step the user has to

154
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:27,690
know what they can do next so for

155
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:30,870
example after you show the answer you

156
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:32,789
can show like some suggested actions

157
00:07:32,789 --> 00:07:35,250
like this for example at the end of

158
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:37,229
every conversation you should show them

159
00:07:37,229 --> 00:07:38,700
like a bunch of stuff telling the user

160
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:42,120
what they can do next you should be able

161
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,710
to handle popular trigger words and

162
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:47,039
phrases so for example help me I'm lost

163
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:50,930
and stuck order I do exist quill and

164
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:53,220
lastly you have to be able to handle

165
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:55,770
their BS because for some reason users

166
00:07:55,770 --> 00:07:57,870
love talking a lot of crap to your BOTS

167
00:07:57,870 --> 00:08:00,389
so you should be able to handle some of

168
00:08:00,389 --> 00:08:03,210
these for a good experience okay so I'm

169
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:05,789
just gonna quickly demo how to do some

170
00:08:05,789 --> 00:08:13,110
of this in about framework okay so this

171
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:15,900
is just using a local emulator as you

172
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:18,030
can see I have some cards so you can use

173
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:20,669
this for your menu and how you

174
00:08:20,669 --> 00:08:23,599
instantiate this just like really simply

175
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:26,910
you can create a message and then just

176
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:29,039
create two hero cards it's pretty

177
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:31,530
self-explanatory if you want to do this

178
00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:34,169
without the about framework I think the

179
00:08:34,169 --> 00:08:36,630
facebook messenger API has some like you

180
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:38,400
have to see what they accept in the

181
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,620
request to send a card to your user and

182
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:42,719
then if I

183
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:47,459
say Lissa okay so these little things in

184
00:08:47,459 --> 00:08:49,079
the bot framework are called um some

185
00:08:49,079 --> 00:08:52,800
suggested actions so you can just push

186
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,899
in a couple of actions so main menu

187
00:08:54,899 --> 00:08:57,180
similar questions so equation and then

188
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:59,009
you send all of these as one message to

189
00:08:59,009 --> 00:09:02,939
your user again messenger API has like

190
00:09:02,939 --> 00:09:05,639
protocols with this so you can just send

191
00:09:05,639 --> 00:09:09,000
the proper request and then if you're on

192
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,120
a handle like special keywords you just

193
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,189
you know user rejects you can just do a

194
00:09:14,189 --> 00:09:16,800
dot trigger action and it will execute

195
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:22,050
the dialog okay so the last one is the

196
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:24,120
small talk and I want to spend a little

197
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:27,509
bit of time talking about this so I

198
00:09:27,509 --> 00:09:29,730
wrote something called the small talk

199
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:32,220
module this one is a little bit harder

200
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:33,750
to do because there's just so many

201
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:37,740
things your user could say okay so API

202
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:40,110
delay is less dialogue flow actually has

203
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:42,930
a small talk module okay and it has like

204
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:46,410
1,400 of our menses so what I did is I

205
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:49,730
basically took out all those and

206
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:54,509
exported it to ATSB thanks google but

207
00:09:54,509 --> 00:09:56,250
yeah I thought this was pretty good so

208
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:58,319
what you can do is go to this bar for

209
00:09:58,319 --> 00:10:00,930
small talk repository and then you can

210
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:03,449
actually train whatever model whatever a

211
00:10:03,449 --> 00:10:04,829
machine learning model you wanna use

212
00:10:04,829 --> 00:10:07,769
with this and then the responses are

213
00:10:07,769 --> 00:10:15,509
actually in a separate okay okay this

214
00:10:15,509 --> 00:10:17,759
one so the responses are all in here I

215
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:20,399
just decoupled them so that you can it's

216
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:24,629
easier to edit this so yeah what I used

217
00:10:24,629 --> 00:10:27,689
to create the Smalltalk module was the

218
00:10:27,689 --> 00:10:30,300
Microsoft Q&A maker but like I say you

219
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:32,189
can use whatever NOP engine you're on

220
00:10:32,189 --> 00:10:34,800
the trainer with and then I just

221
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,589
integrate it inside here because it's

222
00:10:37,589 --> 00:10:42,480
exposed as an API so if I say I just

223
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,970
trigger this say whatever you want um

224
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:48,910
how are you

225
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:54,589
oh you're bad so yeah now we can sort of

226
00:10:54,589 --> 00:10:57,079
answer these little things that they use

227
00:10:57,079 --> 00:11:00,759
up doors I did you say thank you goodbye

228
00:11:00,759 --> 00:11:03,290
super common things and you don't have

229
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:05,089
to use like specific key words you can

230
00:11:05,089 --> 00:11:09,350
just use you know in general words to

231
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:16,519
express yourself cool okay so the next

232
00:11:16,519 --> 00:11:18,589
category is how to manage your boss

233
00:11:18,589 --> 00:11:21,799
display so the first one is you know

234
00:11:21,799 --> 00:11:25,129
just cut to it your user wants the least

235
00:11:25,129 --> 00:11:28,129
number of steps to do something so yeah

236
00:11:28,129 --> 00:11:30,350
make it happen that way and also you

237
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:32,389
have a really limited space to show your

238
00:11:32,389 --> 00:11:34,939
information okay if you think about it

239
00:11:34,939 --> 00:11:37,119
your screen your mobile screen size

240
00:11:37,119 --> 00:11:40,639
assuming your users on mobile it's only

241
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:43,279
this big if you want to show a wall of

242
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:47,419
text or tons of images your users not

243
00:11:47,419 --> 00:11:49,959
going to bother like scrolling up and

244
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:51,559
looking at what you've done

245
00:11:51,559 --> 00:11:54,559
sorry what you have displayed to them so

246
00:11:54,559 --> 00:11:56,419
one good way to overcome this is

247
00:11:56,419 --> 00:12:02,839
actually to you can see on this people

248
00:12:02,839 --> 00:12:05,779
don't read they hate reading sorry I

249
00:12:05,779 --> 00:12:08,439
mean let me show you that again okay

250
00:12:08,439 --> 00:12:11,449
okay let's say your phone screen is only

251
00:12:11,449 --> 00:12:16,160
this big okay so what you want to do is

252
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,199
you actually want to use typing

253
00:12:18,199 --> 00:12:20,860
indicators which are quite a common

254
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:23,269
thing that you can use across different

255
00:12:23,269 --> 00:12:25,699
platforms I think telegram probably has

256
00:12:25,699 --> 00:12:26,389
one as well

257
00:12:26,389 --> 00:12:29,869
and you want to give your users time to

258
00:12:29,869 --> 00:12:32,059
read the chunks of text

259
00:12:32,059 --> 00:12:35,600
bit by bit and like typing indicators

260
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,329
are a really good a really good thing to

261
00:12:38,329 --> 00:12:47,140
use in this scenario okay

262
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:49,580
okay so now I'm going to go through some

263
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:52,470
popular scenarios and when I mean by

264
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:55,260
popular scenarios is a lot of developers

265
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:57,150
always like how do you actually

266
00:12:57,150 --> 00:12:59,940
implement this inside the board okay the

267
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:02,280
first one being authentication it's

268
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:05,040
really natural for someone to want to

269
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,530
authenticate your user through the bot

270
00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:08,700
because you know it's meant to be

271
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:10,230
personalized you want to know who's

272
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:13,670
actually using it so rule number one

273
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:16,860
whatever you do don't handle login

274
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:19,410
through the chat interface itself don't

275
00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:23,760
do it what you want to do is like you

276
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,670
know normal or if you authenticate

277
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:28,620
through Facebook you open a webview and

278
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:32,040
then you just call back to the bot the

279
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,990
bot is basically a web service so you

280
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:36,410
know this is something that's you can do

281
00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:39,930
let me just show you okay I think I need

282
00:13:39,930 --> 00:13:49,590
to stop this first

283
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:56,000
okay

284
00:13:56,010 --> 00:13:59,490
now let's run this saying let's restart

285
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:04,860
the conversation login oh wait what my

286
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:11,250
thing isn't showing that's weird

287
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:18,120
oh okay yes we don't know why it

288
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:22,290
suddenly changed or extent okay so I

289
00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:24,750
basically said login and it's asking me

290
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:27,030
to assign them to my account so just

291
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:30,090
click on that sign in and then I just

292
00:14:30,090 --> 00:14:31,860
make this dummy page just for demo

293
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:33,990
purposes don't do this at home please

294
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:38,660
use HTTP I'm just doing this for demo

295
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:43,050
okay so this is for so that someone else

296
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:48,330
can spoof if they get in your URL okay

297
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:50,400
and then now you're logged in so there's

298
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,050
this whole sort of seamless experience

299
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:54,240
that happens and you can actually just

300
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:58,500
use I've used passport here for those of

301
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,110
you guys who don't know what passport is

302
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:03,930
it's like this super good note package

303
00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:06,660
for handling authentication and I've

304
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:08,490
just defined like a pretty easy local

305
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:11,820
strategy so you can use like whatever

306
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:13,640
strategy you want Facebook Dropbox

307
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:17,790
Microsoft's get hung go goals and then

308
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:21,720
what happens is your bot will receive

309
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,550
that message and then do the validation

310
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:30,000
over here yeah okay so yeah it's quite

311
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,170
flexible and please have no

312
00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:34,050
identification this way all right the

313
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:37,250
next one is custom controls let's say

314
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:40,440
Facebook provides you with like cards or

315
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:43,110
quick replies but they don't provide you

316
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:45,750
with checkboxes for example and you want

317
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:47,370
the user to be able to select multiple

318
00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:51,840
things before sort of going back to your

319
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:54,930
body okay so what you can do is make use

320
00:15:54,930 --> 00:15:57,420
of the web view the web view is your

321
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:59,730
friend it's not this annoying thing that

322
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:02,130
something yeah I don't know people think

323
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:04,260
is annoying sometimes but in facebook

324
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:06,690
it's pretty non intrusive it just opens

325
00:16:06,690 --> 00:16:09,000
up like this so just quickly show you

326
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:09,750
how

327
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:15,870
you can do something like this okay was

328
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:20,880
it I didn't what - sorry so if I say

329
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:26,040
something like quiz okay so let's say

330
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:28,230
you want your user to open this quiz and

331
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:30,900
complete it in in another window you

332
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:34,530
just open it and then you can say okay

333
00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:38,880
why don't you say you know okay and then

334
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,680
when you submit that you can just go

335
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:44,670
back to the bot and yeah the book sort

336
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:48,870
of seamlessly receives the response so

337
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:51,470
yeah you're not just limited to the UI

338
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:55,380
UI templates that are provided to you in

339
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:58,410
the messenger protocol or in any other

340
00:16:58,410 --> 00:17:02,100
chat protocol that you use if you use

341
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:04,110
channels that don't have embedded web

342
00:17:04,110 --> 00:17:06,060
views I would suggest you use this

343
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:07,650
sparingly because it's kind of annoying

344
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:09,900
having to swap through like your Safari

345
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:11,670
browser and then stop back to the bottom

346
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:14,810
so yeah use it unless you really need to

347
00:17:14,810 --> 00:17:19,860
okay so turn on being forms this one

348
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:23,819
seems really simple on face value but

349
00:17:23,819 --> 00:17:26,010
I'm gonna show you why it's not okay and

350
00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:28,680
I want to illustrate this through a

351
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,660
recent thing that we did with a company

352
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:33,330
called we go I don't know if you guys

353
00:17:33,330 --> 00:17:35,940
have heard of heard of them before they

354
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:38,040
have an awesome dev team their company

355
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:40,830
basically is a flight search engine so

356
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:42,930
they have 700 over flight and hotel

357
00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:46,140
partners that they scan through whenever

358
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:48,780
you make a search and we spent two weeks

359
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:52,320
with their dev team building building

360
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:55,230
out a bot that can take user like the

361
00:17:55,230 --> 00:17:57,330
users search history and then provide

362
00:17:57,330 --> 00:18:01,620
recommendations based on that and they

363
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:03,570
also wanted to integrate the flight

364
00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:05,310
search capability inside the bot

365
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:08,250
so the v1 was something like this and

366
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:12,150
then we realized that this is what we

367
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:14,610
want the user to do okay realistically

368
00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:17,460
your user isn't going to be as simple as

369
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:19,230
this because they love being difficult

370
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:22,440
sometimes they're gonna do

371
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,450
like this they're gonna do stuff like

372
00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:29,309
this or this and it's I oh my god why

373
00:18:29,309 --> 00:18:33,179
can you not yeah

374
00:18:33,179 --> 00:18:34,470
so there's actually five different

375
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:36,240
scenarios there's a lot of edge cases

376
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,159
that you have to handle because there's

377
00:18:38,159 --> 00:18:40,019
a ton of different things that they can

378
00:18:40,019 --> 00:18:45,570
change and actually I'm gonna share a

379
00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:49,200
story I try building a v1 of handling

380
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,600
all these different edge cases and let's

381
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,639
say it wasn't the most efficient way you

382
00:18:53,639 --> 00:18:55,769
can do things okay and this was a

383
00:18:55,769 --> 00:18:57,570
conversation between me and their

384
00:18:57,570 --> 00:19:01,289
developer so it's like give me a while

385
00:19:01,289 --> 00:19:03,090
to understand your code first okay

386
00:19:03,090 --> 00:19:05,159
and when I saw this I was like oh my god

387
00:19:05,159 --> 00:19:09,220
what have I done

388
00:19:09,230 --> 00:19:11,789
okay so we went back to the drawing

389
00:19:11,789 --> 00:19:15,769
board and sort of redesigned everything

390
00:19:15,769 --> 00:19:18,720
and it looks something like this

391
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:22,230
this is the more readable version I'm

392
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:23,759
just really bad at drawing errors it's

393
00:19:23,759 --> 00:19:26,460
actually simpler than it looks

394
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:29,009
so before I dig into this I'm just gonna

395
00:19:29,009 --> 00:19:30,299
show you guys what the end result looks

396
00:19:30,299 --> 00:19:44,560
like okay

397
00:19:44,570 --> 00:19:59,570
[Music]

398
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:02,310
okay so because I wanted to build a

399
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:05,200
recommender but you the user had to log

400
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,670
in so that you can retrieve the history

401
00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:09,850
but for today we won't do that say I

402
00:20:09,850 --> 00:20:14,200
want to go to Singapore tomorrow sorry

403
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,520
I'm ready in Singapore and I'll go to

404
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:20,560
Bangkok tomorrow okay

405
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:22,960
so identifies that that's what departure

406
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,030
day and that's your destination

407
00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:27,460
destination okay let's say yeah I'm like

408
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:29,800
the worst user ever and I just say I

409
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:37,000
want to go to Bali instead okay

410
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,390
leave tomorrow and come back and I'm

411
00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:41,740
just totally not answering what the boss

412
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:42,370
saying okay

413
00:20:42,370 --> 00:20:49,390
and come back next Friday okay so you

414
00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:50,770
can see that it's able to handle a lot

415
00:20:50,770 --> 00:20:53,280
of different stuff if I say change my

416
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:57,610
destination they can ask me which city

417
00:20:57,610 --> 00:21:01,660
it will be going to go from Singapore to

418
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:06,940
Singapore okay because I used to live

419
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:09,580
there for a while so it's awesome okay

420
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:10,960
so you can see that this actually

421
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,670
handles like you can throw whatever you

422
00:21:12,670 --> 00:21:16,180
want at it and it can really handle a

423
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:22,570
lot of different scenarios oh it has the

424
00:21:22,570 --> 00:21:24,040
mouse there that's annoying

425
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:25,570
okay so let's break this down a little

426
00:21:25,570 --> 00:21:28,870
bit so the first thing that you start

427
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:30,730
with is you initialize the stack and

428
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:34,360
prompts this is using the above

429
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:36,220
framework but I mean you can you know

430
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:38,380
take the principle behind it so if the

431
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:39,460
user says I'm going to go to Bali

432
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:41,170
tomorrow you initialize the stack and

433
00:21:41,170 --> 00:21:43,180
your prompts that you need from the user

434
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:47,590
and then if if this is the first one

435
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:49,390
so if they've provided some parameters

436
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:51,580
to begin with then you can just go into

437
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:54,940
this loop and validate their parameters

438
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:57,610
sorry if statement otherwise you get the

439
00:21:57,610 --> 00:22:00,130
current context and then you ask the

440
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:02,200
user what you need from them based on

441
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:05,470
the current context and then extracting

442
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:08,500
the intention entities this part for me

443
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:11,030
required natural language processing

444
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:13,790
so either the user can search their

445
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:16,910
flights or they can change whatever

446
00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:18,590
parameter they want and then the

447
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:20,540
entities are basically the parameters

448
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:22,910
that you need from them you might not

449
00:22:22,910 --> 00:22:25,790
need an LP in your situation but I'm

450
00:22:25,790 --> 00:22:27,860
just showing you you know how do i

451
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:30,470
execute if you do need an LP so you can

452
00:22:30,470 --> 00:22:33,020
just extract an intent like this and you

453
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:37,580
can extract that into entities from your

454
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:39,380
users or trends and then you check

455
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:40,880
whether there's an intention for them to

456
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:43,850
change so you check that intent this is

457
00:22:43,850 --> 00:22:45,320
pretty self-explanatory it's just a if

458
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:47,240
statement otherwise you move to validate

459
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:50,540
parameters okay so going on to a

460
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:53,390
validating parameters what you want to

461
00:22:53,390 --> 00:22:56,480
do is get the current context and then

462
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:59,570
you handle the users date and put based

463
00:22:59,570 --> 00:23:01,670
on the current context for example the

464
00:23:01,670 --> 00:23:04,040
user gives you a single day like 30 of

465
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:06,170
January then you have to match it to

466
00:23:06,170 --> 00:23:08,900
your current context to actually find

467
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:11,960
out what they're talking about if

468
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:14,120
there's no valid date input then you

469
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:17,830
just you know save that into the state

470
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:20,510
and then this is how you validate the

471
00:23:20,510 --> 00:23:25,010
location in my case oops if there's no

472
00:23:25,010 --> 00:23:27,770
location just say you know location

473
00:23:27,770 --> 00:23:30,170
insert is false otherwise you just

474
00:23:30,170 --> 00:23:32,600
validate that so you can use whatever

475
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:35,780
validation lodging you want we go has a

476
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:38,780
place API that lets you put in a city

477
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:41,030
code and get a location so that's what

478
00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:44,600
we used to validate and then you pop it

479
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:47,000
off the stack because it's been you know

480
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,770
the location has been identified and

481
00:23:48,770 --> 00:23:51,890
then you move on to the next step which

482
00:23:51,890 --> 00:23:54,440
is checking whether all your parameters

483
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:56,270
have been filled and checking for

484
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:59,330
invalid input so no data entered no

485
00:23:59,330 --> 00:24:02,990
location entered then you go and tell

486
00:24:02,990 --> 00:24:04,640
the user to input a value value

487
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,980
otherwise if there's still things in

488
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:09,770
your stack you have to loop the dialog

489
00:24:09,770 --> 00:24:13,490
again if your stack is empty it means

490
00:24:13,490 --> 00:24:15,350
you have all your parameters and you can

491
00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:18,470
get ready to search yeah so it just

492
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:22,190
loops back here after a while okay so I

493
00:24:22,190 --> 00:24:23,510
want to wrap up with

494
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:26,360
I'm talking about the status quo more

495
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:29,330
specifically these few points so let's

496
00:24:29,330 --> 00:24:33,230
start with the NLP conundrum okay so

497
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:37,520
what I mean by FAQ scenario is those FAQ

498
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:40,070
bots the ones that handle all your

499
00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:42,290
customer service questions or plug into

500
00:24:42,290 --> 00:24:44,510
a knowledgebase to handle many many

501
00:24:44,510 --> 00:24:46,430
different kinds of questions okay

502
00:24:46,430 --> 00:24:49,190
for example maybe the Singapore Airlines

503
00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:52,040
chat bot can answer how a week and a bit

504
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:54,050
baby be when you put it in the best best

505
00:24:54,050 --> 00:24:56,420
net when sure you check in there's like

506
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:57,710
a ton of different questions that you

507
00:24:57,710 --> 00:25:00,860
can ask it now I've really had customers

508
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:03,070
settling just a third party in lp2 and

509
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:07,220
for a couple of reasons this is problem

510
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:09,440
called the code start problem it's

511
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:13,580
basically where you need a lot of

512
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:15,560
training data to reach the accuracy that

513
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:20,090
you need when when you make a NOP model

514
00:25:20,090 --> 00:25:22,370
with too many intents it starts to get

515
00:25:22,370 --> 00:25:24,860
really confused if you don't put enough

516
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:28,760
training data in it initially and yeah

517
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:30,050
this leads to something called intent

518
00:25:30,050 --> 00:25:31,760
illusion this is just something that

519
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:35,570
I've experienced with FAQ scenarios a

520
00:25:35,570 --> 00:25:38,150
lot of engines have intent limitations

521
00:25:38,150 --> 00:25:40,460
and entity limitation in terms of the

522
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:42,230
number of intense and entities that you

523
00:25:42,230 --> 00:25:45,140
can have and also not all languages are

524
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:46,820
supported if you want your bot to go

525
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:50,330
internationally so some possible

526
00:25:50,330 --> 00:25:52,100
solutions you could do to get around

527
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:55,280
this is to use an obvious your first

528
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:57,650
layer but don't forget to about

529
00:25:57,650 --> 00:26:00,950
traditional search this means as your

530
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:03,920
search elastic search sometimes just

531
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:06,740
doing like indexing your knowledge base

532
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:09,140
and answering answering questions

533
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:11,810
through you know like elastic search can

534
00:26:11,810 --> 00:26:15,230
be super effective and secondly when

535
00:26:15,230 --> 00:26:17,690
Emma NLP fails just make sure your UI

536
00:26:17,690 --> 00:26:19,940
your user can actually navigate some

537
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:22,850
buttons to maybe get to get to the

538
00:26:22,850 --> 00:26:24,290
answer that they want okay

539
00:26:24,290 --> 00:26:28,180
so UI is another fallback and sorry if

540
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:32,510
everything else fails go to your fall by

541
00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:34,190
message be like okay I'm still done I

542
00:26:34,190 --> 00:26:36,380
can't handle this and then offer like an

543
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:36,870
email

544
00:26:36,870 --> 00:26:39,090
hand over your honor you know Senate

545
00:26:39,090 --> 00:26:41,640
email to someone or a live chat head

546
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:45,720
over if you have fun okay so number two

547
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:47,940
should you build about should you build

548
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:50,820
a bot this is my rule of thumb if you

549
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:52,430
can google it don't go do it

550
00:26:52,430 --> 00:26:54,570
sorry if you can't bring it don't move

551
00:26:54,570 --> 00:26:59,730
it okay this is like really homemade I

552
00:26:59,730 --> 00:27:03,180
just use the Pens or join in okay so the

553
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:05,280
great debate bots versus search engines

554
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:07,050
versus apps I mean this is on everyone's

555
00:27:07,050 --> 00:27:08,880
mind right

556
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,410
when building a boat you ask yourself

557
00:27:10,410 --> 00:27:12,660
three things number one does your bot

558
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:15,330
have a unique value proposition that you

559
00:27:15,330 --> 00:27:17,929
can't do by a search engine or your app

560
00:27:17,929 --> 00:27:21,000
number two can it do it much faster than

561
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,090
using a search engine or an app and

562
00:27:23,090 --> 00:27:26,070
number three doesn't actually fulfill

563
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:28,800
some sort of purpose or do you just like

564
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,750
the idea of having a bot because you

565
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:32,610
know it's like a password it's like dock

566
00:27:32,610 --> 00:27:36,290
chain for AI about shame for everything

567
00:27:36,290 --> 00:27:41,940
okay and lastly why why build a boat you

568
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:43,260
know

569
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:46,350
so for these couple of reasons they open

570
00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:47,820
up a new channel especially to

571
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:49,620
Millennials so a lot of Millennials

572
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:51,660
actually love using boats you might not

573
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:54,890
use it but they definitely are using it

574
00:27:54,890 --> 00:27:57,270
and yeah it just opens a new engagement

575
00:27:57,270 --> 00:28:01,020
channel for customer service it helps

576
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:02,220
you alleviate a lot of the dumb

577
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:05,910
questions that your users might have so

578
00:28:05,910 --> 00:28:07,800
yeah it will help you alleviate customer

579
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:10,710
service you can engage users in your way

580
00:28:10,710 --> 00:28:14,730
and lastly it's personalized so I worked

581
00:28:14,730 --> 00:28:18,570
I was talking to the CTO of we go and I

582
00:28:18,570 --> 00:28:20,250
was asking him you know why do you wanna

583
00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:22,110
build a bot because you already have an

584
00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:24,510
ad sorry yeah you already have an empire

585
00:28:24,510 --> 00:28:28,890
no website and he said you know I think

586
00:28:28,890 --> 00:28:32,179
chat and voice interfaces are the future

587
00:28:32,179 --> 00:28:36,570
one day I want to have a bot that's that

588
00:28:36,570 --> 00:28:39,090
really knows my preferences so for

589
00:28:39,090 --> 00:28:40,950
example if I want to go to fly on a

590
00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:43,740
business trip to Manila it knows that I

591
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:45,900
want to fly first-class I can't afford

592
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:48,380
it yet but I want to fight first past

593
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:49,910
and I want to fly Philippines Airlines

594
00:28:49,910 --> 00:28:53,840
and you can skip a lot of the you know

595
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:56,150
men or searching so that's the future

596
00:28:56,150 --> 00:28:58,940
that here mission with it and yeah I

597
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:00,500
really think that that's a super

598
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:02,000
exciting future and I don't think it's

599
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,030
too far away from now come on

600
00:29:05,030 --> 00:29:06,620
