00:00:09,269 --> 00:00:11,129

along my hole my name is Taylor

2
00:00:11,129 --> 00:00:12,150
hole

3
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:14,519
designer I have

4
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:16,260
speaking with you all today a little bit

5
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:17,880
about myself but more importantly

6
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:20,070
something I'm very passionate about my

7
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:21,779
Hawaiian culture and how it's paved the

8
00:00:21,779 --> 00:00:23,610
way for Buddhist for me to be successful

9
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:25,480
in fact

10
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:28,539
so today I'm a senior senior UI UX

11
00:00:28,539 --> 00:00:30,189
designer at twitch other headquarters

12
00:00:30,189 --> 00:00:33,100
over at San Francisco in my past I

13
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:34,390
worked at companies like Unity

14
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:36,489
Technologies have actually started my

15
00:00:36,489 --> 00:00:38,949
career not too far from here now in Ala

16
00:00:38,949 --> 00:00:41,290
Moana Boulevard in downtown Honolulu at

17
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:45,610
wall-to-wall studio

18
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:47,539
show of hands who here considers

19
00:00:47,539 --> 00:00:51,220
themselves

20
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:54,440
alright ok ok so now for the rest of you

21
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:56,210
that didn't raise your hands what about

22
00:00:56,210 --> 00:01:00,650
your work is what you do create alright

23
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:02,810
lots of nodding heads ok cool

24
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:05,810
I'm in the right room that's majority of

25
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:08,960
us here so because of that I'm really

26
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,760
excited to spend these next few days

27
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:12,520
with everybody here at JS comp

28
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:15,200
harnessing creativity I guess has been

29
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,720
this ongoing adventure of mine from

30
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:20,260
printing my earliest sticker slaps to

31
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:22,760
producing on the street interview shows

32
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:25,520
to working on short films and making

33
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,500
surfboards and making t-shirts and

34
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:31,820
producing graphics now amongst amongst

35
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:34,400
the many there's one craft that has

36
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:40,190
always had my heart web design a web web

37
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:42,080
design I mean if you could call this

38
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:44,570
that so like many of you I started

39
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:46,790
building websites at a very early age I

40
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:49,009
was 14 at the time when I published this

41
00:01:49,009 --> 00:01:50,380
work of art to the World Wide Web

42
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:53,119
it was a mix of boilerplate PHP

43
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:55,910
templates FTP applications that I just

44
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:57,740
kind of learned as I went and Photoshop

45
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:01,190
tutorials on pirated software it was

46
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:02,600
kind of like all just duct-taped

47
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:06,320
together barely holding on

48
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:08,670
now fast-forward 15 years I work on

49
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:10,350
designing products that touch millions

50
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:13,260
today twitch is a popular live streaming

51
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:15,150
platform most well-known for gaming and

52
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:16,800
eSports but it also has growing

53
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,830
communities within our IRL or in

54
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:22,440
real-life categories like travel art and

55
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:26,010
exercise it's the kind of place to work

56
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:29,040
where culture fit means identifying

57
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,550
memes it's amazing so now I decided now

58
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:33,930
I design products what does that

59
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:36,960
actually mean so you think this design

60
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,520
software like Big Ma I come up with

61
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:41,250
interfaces and user flows for the things

62
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:43,680
that we ship to our users a couple

63
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,320
examples include on the left the email

64
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,730
verification step during new user

65
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:50,360
onboarding and dead-center is our new

66
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:53,310
channel profile page this is kind of

67
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:55,800
like cutting-edge stuff I think we ran

68
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,510
it to an experiment group so far so it's

69
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:01,130
technically public

70
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:02,700
also dip into my roots as a developer

71
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:04,980
using internal built systems like our in

72
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:07,590
a house divided prototype tool I built

73
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:09,900
in browser prototypes using knowing

74
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:11,940
react and typescript has allowed me to

75
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:14,340
be just dangerous enough the biggest

76
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:16,260
benefit is deeply understanding how our

77
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:18,930
primitives work together in a kind of a

78
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:21,600
production like environment these

79
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,640
prototypes are used as proof of concepts

80
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:27,120
as well as tools for user testing but

81
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,680
I'll okay just like flexing on my

82
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:33,180
engineers every now and then

83
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:35,680
uh I'm also the designer responsible for

84
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,240
the great round if occasion of user

85
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:39,460
avatars but something we did some eight

86
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:42,190
months ago you'd expect this that I've

87
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:43,480
been a fairly straightforward process

88
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,550
just update the default border-radius

89
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:48,370
unum that's on our avatar component but

90
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:50,170
half of design is building support for

91
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:54,040
your ideas so and and that's which don't

92
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,750
expect don't expect things to be that

93
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:58,850
easy

94
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:01,470
now I've often wondered what has helped

95
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:04,020
inspire my creativity in these last 15

96
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:06,090
years a lot of life and a lot of

97
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:08,100
learnings have happened how did I end up

98
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:09,360
working in such a rapidly growing

99
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,270
industry now I think it has a lot to do

100
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:14,790
with very fortunate timing I grew up in

101
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:16,260
the Internet age I had a computer at

102
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:18,329
home but above all there was one thing

103
00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:20,100
that has continued to inspire me

104
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:23,830
creatively

105
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,970
do believe being born and raised with

106
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:27,590
the values and hard knocks of a Hawaiian

107
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:29,930
culture that any impact I've been able

108
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:32,630
to achieve has been rooted in my

109
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:36,850
upbringing

110
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:38,720
I'd like to share with you all today is

111
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:43,000
Cola here repeat after me :

112
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,170
so you could define Cola Hijaz

113
00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:47,990
mischievious rascal rogue or to be a

114
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:50,050
prankster

115
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:53,080
one thing I know for sure Hawaiians are

116
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:57,970
hollow here ah the invent of the flip

117
00:04:57,970 --> 00:04:59,860
camera phone

118
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:02,599
amazing

119
00:05:02,599 --> 00:05:05,849
it's so cool oh hey it's in the Kona our

120
00:05:05,849 --> 00:05:07,710
metaphor in our music it's in the

121
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:10,830
stories retold in our history it's in

122
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:13,050
our nature a lot of growing up was about

123
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:14,869
having fun and going against the grain

124
00:05:14,869 --> 00:05:17,189
we'd always follow up talking story

125
00:05:17,189 --> 00:05:19,139
about our miss house either at each

126
00:05:19,139 --> 00:05:21,499
other's houses or at the lunch table

127
00:05:21,499 --> 00:05:24,119
we'd always have a laugh at whose antics

128
00:05:24,119 --> 00:05:27,810
stop the rest

129
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:30,550
this one is allegedly me I say allegedly

130
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:33,580
because you know statutes of limitations

131
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:36,550
and stuff I apologize if some time back

132
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:39,070
in 2009 you were randomly missing a

133
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:44,560
rubbish can cover

134
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:46,700
now in hindsight maybe it was an

135
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:48,350
interest in taking risks it was all

136
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:50,840
about what stories would stick we're all

137
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,500
excited about pushing the boundaries and

138
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:57,900
seeing what we could get away with

139
00:05:57,910 --> 00:05:59,770
growing up Kahlua has taught me about

140
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:02,290
being calculated when taking risks what

141
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:03,700
better way to grow comfortable with

142
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:05,950
risks then throwing rationale at it

143
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:09,010
right nowadays the consequences can take

144
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:10,690
the business down so for that reason

145
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:13,270
I've come up with the framework on how

146
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:16,250
to approach this

147
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:18,090
so first set out what you're going to do

148
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:20,850
this is the fun part decide what you're

149
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:23,490
going to try at work this is driven by

150
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:25,380
team goals and things that impact their

151
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:27,960
users in my former life this was

152
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,910
probably driven by peer pressure and a

153
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:34,020
lack of self-awareness

154
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:36,730
next step is the careful balance of risk

155
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:39,760
and reward this is the exact part that

156
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:42,910
we skipped when we were younger so you

157
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:45,430
know apply to tech with a B with an a/b

158
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:47,110
testing framework set up you can

159
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:48,760
actually mitigate risk by sending a

160
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:51,040
limited set of users to a specific

161
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:54,970
variant

162
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:56,810
now given you've thought about it adjust

163
00:06:56,810 --> 00:07:01,360
your approach or just go for it

164
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:04,070
now assuming you did it learn adjust and

165
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:06,380
depending on the type of project try

166
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:09,190
again

167
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,270
one of my first projects at twitch was

168
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:13,310
supporting the marathon team the

169
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:14,660
engineering team would take hard drives

170
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:16,280
of episodes and stream them back-to-back

171
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:19,720
for days on end using tools like ffmpeg

172
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,830
we would also build out unique

173
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:27,290
experience for these channel pages

174
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:30,060
marathon hit home for a lot of us the

175
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:31,650
marathon was unique because it added a

176
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:33,539
fundraising component for local PBS

177
00:07:33,539 --> 00:07:36,840
stations the marathon happened to add a

178
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:41,069
very critical time in 2017 of public

179
00:07:41,069 --> 00:07:42,900
broadcasting funding was under threat by

180
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:45,300
the new acting president I won't mention

181
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:49,889
names we wanted to see if we could for

182
00:07:49,889 --> 00:07:52,229
lack of better word manufacture delight

183
00:07:52,229 --> 00:07:54,030
for our users he had an ongoing

184
00:07:54,030 --> 00:07:56,669
hypothesis that getting users to meme in

185
00:07:56,669 --> 00:08:00,479
Chad would lead them to coming back who

186
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:03,810
wants to miss the next inside joke we

187
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:05,490
did this by applying a black and white

188
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:07,349
CSS filter to the entire interface

189
00:08:07,349 --> 00:08:09,000
during the black-and-white episodes that

190
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
aired during the 1960s needless to say

191
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,409
we learned a ton from this experiment

192
00:08:15,409 --> 00:08:17,779
we indeed did get a negative feedback

193
00:08:17,779 --> 00:08:21,159
for one chat complain from telling

194
00:08:21,159 --> 00:08:23,389
others you know they did some like

195
00:08:23,389 --> 00:08:25,369
rationale calculation for how many eight

196
00:08:25,369 --> 00:08:28,129
seasons were left how long they had to

197
00:08:28,129 --> 00:08:29,419
wait until the black and white would go

198
00:08:29,419 --> 00:08:31,489
away or they just like stayed up

199
00:08:31,489 --> 00:08:33,879
complain because that's what chat does

200
00:08:33,879 --> 00:08:36,099
then we started seeing interestingly

201
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:39,110
YouTube tutorials start popping up for

202
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:40,699
how to actually open inspector and

203
00:08:40,699 --> 00:08:42,940
disable our CSS

204
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:44,990
you

205
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:46,940
I had to hear I had to clear out

206
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:49,010
co-workers that weren't so amused by our

207
00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:52,019
active Jess

208
00:08:52,019 --> 00:08:54,610
but then again we also got positive

209
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:57,790
feedback that did what that does and it

210
00:08:57,790 --> 00:09:00,100
means in all of its glory there were

211
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:02,009
jokes about black and white TV and

212
00:09:02,009 --> 00:09:05,259
invention of color not only that but our

213
00:09:05,259 --> 00:09:07,899
fundraiser was largely successful we

214
00:09:07,899 --> 00:09:11,790
raised over 42,000 dollars for local PBS

215
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:14,199
on top of that we got really good

216
00:09:14,199 --> 00:09:17,170
feedback internally I had a director

217
00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:18,759
reach out excited about our team being

218
00:09:18,759 --> 00:09:25,810
bold in finding ways that the later used

219
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:28,100
making an impact on the world is just

220
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:30,940
going to take a little below

221
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:33,760
that's my boy

222
00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:36,290
okay so the next concept that I'd like

223
00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:38,930
to share with you all is rooted in Aloha

224
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:43,260
repeat after me Aloha mine

225
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:46,120
in our Aloha

226
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:48,820
very good so you could define Aloha as

227
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:50,680
hello or goodbye I'm sure when you

228
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:52,060
walked in the airport you heard all

229
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:54,280
kinds shock about is like oh no Hahn's

230
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:57,370
oh but it also means love affection

231
00:09:57,370 --> 00:10:00,700
compassion mercy sympathy kindness

232
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:03,580
sentiment in Greece

233
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:05,320
here's a quote from probably the most

234
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:07,570
renown ambassador of Aloha Duke

235
00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:10,240
Kahanamoku here he talks about his

236
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,590
perception of Aloha

237
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:15,480
but distill it down Aloha is about love

238
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,950
understanding making friends and taking

239
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:18,850
care of one another

240
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:20,920
he leaves us with the call to action to

241
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,840
meet and leave people with Aloha

242
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:27,200
everywhere you go

243
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:31,050
is a directional marker from my vocab

244
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:33,930
things out there so Aloha and off go

245
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:36,150
together means putting good vibes out

246
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:38,370
into the world be generous with your

247
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:40,560
time when people reach out for he'll be

248
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,320
happy to me a part of a part of it is

249
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,670
remembering where you were a year ago

250
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:47,490
say five years ago think back to when

251
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:50,280
you just got started and be friendly

252
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:52,710
smile make eye contacts day what's up to

253
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:54,210
the guy that you see in the hallway all

254
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:56,670
the time

255
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:59,380
contrast the suffix my me reverses the

256
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:01,930
direction if done right opportunities

257
00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:04,149
will start to conquer where he opens to

258
00:11:04,149 --> 00:11:05,800
them that's the people you meet by

259
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,870
default then calibrate by learning to

260
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:10,779
tell the bad from the good have an error

261
00:11:10,779 --> 00:11:11,680
of receptiveness

262
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,470
in to be an antenna for good things and

263
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:19,110
good things will come

264
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,420
so for all my visual thinkers first you

265
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:24,670
must carry Aloha with you everywhere you

266
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:29,860
go this is the exact concept of Aloha oh

267
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:31,990
I don't like putting it out into the

268
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:34,910
world

269
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:37,440
surely people will reciprocate its kind

270
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,600
of the idea of Aloha money you'll end up

271
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,770
receiving it

272
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:44,610
and you'll find that aloha propagates

273
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:47,010
aloha impact what's around you and

274
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:49,980
what's around you will impact you that's

275
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:53,650
just how it works

276
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:55,460
in San Francisco its this hustle and

277
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:57,140
bustle being surrounded by hundreds of

278
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:59,030
thousands of people kind of all packed

279
00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:01,760
in this 40-something square miles it's

280
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,290
easy to forget the importance of being

281
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:06,560
kind generous and thoughtful but by

282
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,380
carrying aloha you stand out and it has

283
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:15,620
even more of an impact on people

284
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:18,000
how you would order one of these and

285
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,410
help by email

286
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:22,850
what would you call it

287
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:25,579
Oh bra plate lunch that's my dog with

288
00:12:25,579 --> 00:12:28,100
someone dog plate lunch mixed plate is

289
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:31,879
another word too so here is one of the

290
00:12:31,879 --> 00:12:33,499
more famous examples of a mixed plate

291
00:12:33,499 --> 00:12:35,600
over at rainbows drive-in it's about ten

292
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,889
minutes from here right off Kalakaua

293
00:12:36,889 --> 00:12:39,439
Avenue we can go check them out later

294
00:12:39,439 --> 00:12:41,239
tap me on the shoulder we go I get my

295
00:12:41,239 --> 00:12:44,359
4runner considered the variation of food

296
00:12:44,359 --> 00:12:47,959
here from mahi-mahi - chicken - Terry

297
00:12:47,959 --> 00:12:50,499
beef potato salad all over a bed of rice

298
00:12:50,499 --> 00:12:52,519
continue it on your plans that afternoon

299
00:12:52,519 --> 00:12:57,709
gravy all over all together this mix is

300
00:12:57,709 --> 00:13:00,190
heavenly

301
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:03,710
a plate lunch is a artist sorry a mixed

302
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:05,120
plate is a plate lunch with several

303
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,640
types of main or entree servings put on

304
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:09,350
the same plate it's also how you

305
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:11,570
describe someone with multiple ethnic

306
00:13:11,570 --> 00:13:13,769
backgrounds

307
00:13:13,769 --> 00:13:17,309
California so a lot of us here have rich

308
00:13:17,309 --> 00:13:20,790
mixed Heritage's a quarter of us here

309
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:22,230
are mixed essentially in one way or

310
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:23,069
another

311
00:13:23,069 --> 00:13:24,809
researchers at Pew Research Center

312
00:13:24,809 --> 00:13:27,179
actually found that Hawaii has the most

313
00:13:27,179 --> 00:13:32,380
mixed people in the United States

314
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:37,949
one em a mixed plate

315
00:13:37,959 --> 00:13:40,130
Native Hawaiian Chinese Japanese

316
00:13:40,130 --> 00:13:42,140
Portuguese Jeremy and all those squashes

317
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:44,450
what we call it that's kind of like all

318
00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:50,710
of the best foods all in one that's me

319
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,970
so I tend to also follow this path in my

320
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:55,550
professional life UX designer UI

321
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:57,800
developer motion graphics graphic design

322
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:02,329
data visit visualization it it tends to

323
00:14:02,329 --> 00:14:08,389
lead to a lot of inner turmoil but I

324
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:12,480
digress

325
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:14,980
so this diversity range is a strength

326
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:17,380
it's kind of like having more tools in

327
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:19,690
the tool belt so to say and a recent

328
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:21,120
piece published in The New York Times

329
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:24,250
the title says it all want to be less

330
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:27,340
racist move to Hawaii the articles point

331
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:30,650
expands beyond race

332
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:32,819
it talks about how navigating multiple

333
00:14:32,819 --> 00:14:38,540
worlds enhances mental flexibility

334
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:40,830
of mental flexibility is what we call a

335
00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:42,839
cognitive bias it's known as functional

336
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:46,200
fixedness it's the inability to think

337
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,810
outside of the box it's essentially the

338
00:14:48,810 --> 00:14:50,820
expectation that people have when they

339
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:54,110
approach new problems with old solutions

340
00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:56,029
expecting different results

341
00:14:56,029 --> 00:14:59,250
even those arguing about texts have the

342
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:02,100
Paramount success as they say what got

343
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:06,830
you here won't get you there

344
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:09,030
Timur leading one remember the things

345
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:12,090
that make you you it takes every one of

346
00:15:12,090 --> 00:15:15,330
us all aspects of us to create to

347
00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:21,170
produce creative solutions

348
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:24,240
at a mackerel or team level it's all

349
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,650
about finding you're surrounding

350
00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:26,880
yourself with people who think

351
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,310
differently than yourself during Hawaii

352
00:15:29,310 --> 00:15:31,140
we're constantly faced by different

353
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:33,900
thinking people from your friends to

354
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:36,110
your neighbors to your classmates their

355
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:38,520
distant family members whatever and my

356
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,290
cousins auntie's brothers husband's

357
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:41,430
husband's boyfriend

358
00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:44,640
oh we're constantly face to face with a

359
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:47,160
diverse population context switching

360
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:50,230
becomes natural

361
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,750
not about hiring diversity to meet quota

362
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:55,310
hiring goes with novel problem-solving

363
00:15:55,310 --> 00:15:57,440
will improve your ability to innovate

364
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,690
and because we don't have the ability

365
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:01,490
because we don't have the brilliant

366
00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:03,160
minds of marginalized people

367
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:05,690
contributing we need to start welcoming

368
00:16:05,690 --> 00:16:09,820
the man-boy

369
00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:11,780
concept I'd like to share is more

370
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:18,020
clucking repeat after me both bye

371
00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:23,120
lokahi as unity agreement or harmony

372
00:16:23,130 --> 00:16:26,510
Mulcahy in the canoe

373
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:27,860
in canoes in my early teens to my

374
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:30,530
twenties we were super competitive

375
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:34,880
we were absolutely obsessed

376
00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:37,110
in the troop in the canoe everyone

377
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:39,360
serves a role there's no dead weight in

378
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,030
the boat once it's the pace and other

379
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:43,980
watches closely to keep the canoe in

380
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:44,460
sync

381
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:47,430
a couple stay true and just blast the

382
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:50,310
next works as utility man and the last

383
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:52,400
controls the direction of the boat just

384
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:57,650
like in

385
00:16:57,660 --> 00:17:00,450
when applying lokahi at work consider

386
00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:06,550
the Triforce

387
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:07,809
I'm

388
00:17:07,809 --> 00:17:11,829
really good Olivia it's a mix of experts

389
00:17:11,829 --> 00:17:14,620
in multiple disciplines at work it's the

390
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:18,500
mix of product engineering and design

391
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,360
just like in the canoe we all rely on

392
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:22,339
 on each other for what we bring to

393
00:17:22,339 --> 00:17:24,560
on each other for what we bring to
the team for example design brings

394
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,420
visual thinking and a passion for the

395
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:28,670
user experience engineering brings

396
00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:30,530
systems thinking and a deep

397
00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:32,060
understanding of the feasibility of

398
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:34,160
building a thing and product brings

399
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,680
coordination and an understanding of

400
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:41,210
product liability

401
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:43,140
to dependent dynamics between each of us

402
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:45,120
it's critical that we trust each other

403
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,120
and gift me back when it's needed the

404
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,650
improvement of one of us strengthens the

405
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:54,200
whole system

406
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:56,759
in the end when we work together magic

407
00:17:56,759 --> 00:17:59,279
is the result at work it's building

408
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:01,440
things were proud of in the canoe it was

409
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,499
state championships humble brag we won

410
00:18:04,499 --> 00:18:08,640
three

411
00:18:08,650 --> 00:18:12,190
so now it takes more than just the three

412
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:14,920
of us at work like a child a good

413
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:17,770
product takes a village consider how any

414
00:18:17,770 --> 00:18:19,420
of these affirm engines dynamics can be

415
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:21,250
applied to the multitude of supporting

416
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:29,880
functions that exist on our team

417
00:18:29,890 --> 00:18:32,740
you know you're my arnica wanna and that

418
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:35,830
means and so the story is told but what

419
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:37,630
I'll leave you with is now that I've

420

face that you don't see too many of in

425
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:50,140

429
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:00,130
JavaScript but let your personal

430
00:19:00,130 --> 00:19:03,230
background shine

431
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:05,550
a position to hire look out for these

432
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:07,800
people remember that these unique

433
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:12,090
thinkers will be the key to your success

434
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:18,320
