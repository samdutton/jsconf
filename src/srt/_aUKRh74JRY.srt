1
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:21,520

you

2
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:24,540


3
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:27,689
alright for those who have seen hackers

4
00:00:27,689 --> 00:00:32,610
uh see if this goes it's not gonna go oh

5
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:35,110
now use your best buyers is to buy us

6
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:36,430
some time we have to get into plagues

7
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:40,540
file and copy the worm all right there's

8
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:41,890
a little tension breaker they had to be

9
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:44,350
done all right okay so tension breaker

10
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:47,890
right I think only a few you got that so

11
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:50,500
before we go any further I want to give

12
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:56,409
a very thank you to the organizers of

13
00:00:56,409 --> 00:01:01,510
jas comfy you who believed that security

14
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:04,780
had a place at a developer event there

15
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:07,690
is there was three talks about security

16
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:09,360
at a developer event and that is

17
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:13,360
absolutely unheard of and I am very very

18
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,429
grateful for this opportunity please

19
00:01:15,429 --> 00:01:19,479
everyone give a giant thank you too jaan

20
00:01:19,479 --> 00:01:24,990
Holger Tiffany and ma thay yes thank you

21
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:28,300
so hey everyone I'm Adam as was said I

22
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:30,700
am NOT a Baldwin brother you can find me

23
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:32,770
on Twitter at Adam underscore Baldwin

24
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:35,110
and a whole bunch of other places I'm

25
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:37,869
evil packet on github and I'm the chief

26
00:01:37,869 --> 00:01:39,789
security officer at and yet we're a lot

27
00:01:39,789 --> 00:01:41,890
of these things that I'm going to talk

28
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:45,130
about have transpired I get to work on

29
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:48,859
some really cool things like an bang

30
00:01:48,869 --> 00:01:52,720
talkie I oh and I'm also the team lead

31
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:56,080
at lift security where I get to

32
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:58,090
basically help developers secure

33
00:01:58,090 --> 00:02:00,940
software and build security into the

34
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:04,450
culture of their dev teams and also the

35
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:06,429
founder and organizer of the note

36
00:02:06,429 --> 00:02:10,000
security project a rather and exciting

37
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,670
and insane experiment to audit all of

38
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:14,800
the things on NPM which there's like

39
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,080
40,000 modules now and bridge the

40
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:22,239
security and devel try to make them play

41
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:23,830
nicely together and we'll talk about

42
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:28,989
that more later so as it turns out when

43
00:02:28,989 --> 00:02:33,349
it comes to security we're

44
00:02:33,349 --> 00:02:39,690
right that's basically it nothing is a

45
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:42,569
hundred percent secure this is this is a

46
00:02:42,569 --> 00:02:45,209
realization that we have to come to in

47
00:02:45,209 --> 00:02:47,459
building software there's going to be

48
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:49,739
bugs we're going to inject security

49
00:02:49,739 --> 00:02:53,040
flaws we are going to be eventually at

50
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:58,849
some point so let's talk about risk

51
00:02:58,849 --> 00:03:00,959
risks a board game about world

52
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:05,640
domination you spread out armies around

53
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,560
the board in pursuit of conquering the

54
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,750
entire Earth it's a it's very slow to

55
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:12,420
move around armies so typical strategy

56
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:15,090
is to focus on deploying new armies at

57
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:17,370
entry point or entry points for defense

58
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:19,860
and building up armies when you're going

59
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:23,519
to attack right in a risk battle you

60
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:25,079
match dice one-to-one highest to lowest

61
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:27,660
and the attacker gets three dice the

62
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:29,400
defender gets two dice right there you

63
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,690
notice that the attacker has the

64
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:32,940
advantage but the defender can only roll

65
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:35,579
with as many dices they have armies so

66
00:03:35,579 --> 00:03:37,590
when you only have one died left you're

67
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:40,230
rolling one against three so the

68
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:41,519
attacker has broken through the outer

69
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:43,109
boundary and it's pretty easy to sweep

70
00:03:43,109 --> 00:03:47,280
through and if Iceland attacks Greenland

71
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,500
in this scenario which is totally prone

72
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:52,680
to happen Greenland is going to get a

73
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,959
roll with two dice and it's going to be

74
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:57,030
a pretty big battle but if green land

75
00:03:57,030 --> 00:04:00,120
only has is the only need offends with

76
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:03,120
one army in this scenario let's be

77
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,130
honest Iceland's going to pone all of

78
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:07,680
North America yes including Alberta

79
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,290
sorry Alberta and attackers have the

80
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:12,359
advantage attackers basically have the

81
00:04:12,359 --> 00:04:14,549
advantage and that's it's it it's akin

82
00:04:14,549 --> 00:04:16,109
to the way it works in software two

83
00:04:16,109 --> 00:04:18,810
attackers have to find one flaw to get

84
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:21,810
it gain a foothold and as defenders as

85
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:23,729
developers we have to find and address

86
00:04:23,729 --> 00:04:26,310
them all it's a rather daunting an

87
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:30,630
impossible task software is hard I don't

88
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:31,740
think that anybody's going to disagree

89
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:33,750
with me that billing software is hard

90
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:34,770
enough without adding additional

91
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:37,590
complexities software is also full of

92
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:40,349
opinions we've got things like mobile

93
00:04:40,349 --> 00:04:42,960
first right lots of first content first

94
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,400
off line first

95
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:49,690
whoo but a lot of what you build doesn't

96
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:51,759
mean crap if it's not built on a

97
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:54,850
foundation of security and privacy which

98
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:57,310
can take all of the fun out of what

99
00:04:57,310 --> 00:05:00,580
you're building in software is full of

100
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:02,919
constraints right we've we've we've got

101
00:05:02,919 --> 00:05:06,340
constraints like time and money a boss

102
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:08,020
you know pointing her boss that's

103
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:09,160
breathing down our neck to get a

104
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:12,160
features ground out right I but security

105
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,580
is one of those constraints that that

106
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:17,350
has to be filtered into that sort of

107
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:21,130
equation so who is responsible for

108
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:26,169
security anyone want to take a guess you

109
00:05:26,169 --> 00:05:33,760
are sorry but you need to be up to the

110
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,860
challenge right like it it whether you

111
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:37,690
like it or not you're the first line of

112
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:39,610
defense in addressing and fixing

113
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:42,130
security flaws in the software you build

114
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:44,410
your the ones building it it's time to

115
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:48,820
take some responsibility for this I was

116
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:50,650
talking to the martine before the talk

117
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:52,870
and as a developer if you if you don't

118
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:55,000
care about security but others care

119
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,440
about security in your organization or

120
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,169
that deal with that software your

121
00:05:58,169 --> 00:06:02,710
negating their effort a bit security is

122
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:04,449
not something that you can just it's not

123
00:06:04,449 --> 00:06:06,639
a department that that or a third party

124
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:10,360
that takes care of it for you and if

125
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,440
it's that if that's the way you're doing

126
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,419
it you're doing it wrong it's just not

127
00:06:13,419 --> 00:06:16,680
bolt on so why is your responsibility

128
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:19,389
well people like my wonderful family

129
00:06:19,389 --> 00:06:23,050
there use your software they use it for

130
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:24,940
banking transactions and social networks

131
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:27,400
and you know all those private messages

132
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:30,880
that we you know send back and forth you

133
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,669
have a responsibility to handle people's

134
00:06:33,669 --> 00:06:38,680
data with respect and help me as the

135
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,780
consumer of your library or your final

136
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:45,580
product that it's being done on how that

137
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:47,650
security how you're treating that data

138
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:51,250
with respect many people that user

139
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:53,770
software would would likely be outraged

140
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:56,380
by how Cavalier we handle some of some

141
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:58,660
of their data we owe them the respect

142
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:03,340
to handle that appropriately last year

143
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:06,310
excuse me 2013 I think that's right at

144
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:08,050
the NSA spent 25 million dollars on

145
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:11,800
software vulnerabilities they purchased

146
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:14,890
Oh days and vulnerabilities to you know

147
00:07:14,890 --> 00:07:18,220
do their bidding we have a

148
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:20,860
responsibility as developers to stay off

149
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:28,630
of that menu right we we should just not

150
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:33,960
be part of that procurement process also

151
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:38,620
litigation is coming we have the FTC

152
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:39,940
which is forcing a company called

153
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:42,130
trendnet who had a vulnerability in some

154
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:46,000
camera software to suffer 20 years of

155
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,020
auditing we would love if somebody from

156
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:52,540
the government forced us to have to

157
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:54,220
audit our software right as developers

158
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:55,540
you would love that right that'd be

159
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:59,410
that'd be great so if we don't police

160
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:04,270
and handle our in our own community in

161
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:06,550
our own software that external force is

162
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:07,720
going to come it's going to come

163
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,100
eventually it's happened in other

164
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:11,350
industries so it's just something to

165
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:14,169
remember okay so enough doom and gloom

166
00:08:14,169 --> 00:08:18,460
already should we give up hell no we

167
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:21,430
fight back we don't make this easy we

168
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:23,140
don't give in not every geek with a

169
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:26,350
Commodore 64 can hack into NASA so

170
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:29,680
something has to change right we have to

171
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,690
build a security first culture we have

172
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:35,800
to we just have to we just have to do

173
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:38,260
better and the thing is is that that

174
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:39,849
sorry I mentioned earlier we're

175
00:08:39,849 --> 00:08:42,039
right well it's just it's a constantly

176
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:44,890
evolving process we just need to take

177
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:50,890
one step do better iterate so I'm going

178
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:52,330
to tell you about the story of and yet

179
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:56,860
and how I came to be at and yet and how

180
00:08:56,860 --> 00:09:01,810
we handle security at and yet basically

181
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:04,390
how I was a seed crystal in and yet and

182
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:06,010
most people know that a seed crystal

183
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:09,160
will produce beautiful results given the

184
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:12,780
right environment and the right

185
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:15,220
sort of the right right growing

186
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:16,450
environment but it can't do its job

187
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:19,450
without that right environment given you

188
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:25,360
know even best efforts so I met Adam

189
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,340
brault at and yet about five years ago

190
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:29,290
and I was running a consultancy called

191
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:31,690
ingenuity and basically a single person

192
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:33,910
consultancy to two of us and he was

193
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:35,500
running a web development shop and we

194
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,960
realized very early on that it was a

195
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:41,170
very symbiotic relationship I could help

196
00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:44,410
him grow and build his business and it

197
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:46,770
meant a business from for me as well

198
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:49,990
it's old contracts for him to have a

199
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:53,050
partnership with with security showing

200
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:55,120
that the level of care that they took in

201
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,280
security for their software was the

202
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:59,470
difference between many other very

203
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:05,380
larger and named vendors and so it

204
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:07,690
started there and so I would tell him

205
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:09,430
about you know hey you wrote this and

206
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:11,200
you did this you did this wrong right

207
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,540
all intensive purposes and so I taught

208
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:15,460
him so early on when I was him but as we

209
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:17,770
started to add people I was still this

210
00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:20,590
external entity right and so as he added

211
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:22,270
people they write code and I'd review it

212
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:26,440
and as we moved along their people

213
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:30,130
eventually started learning hey we don't

214
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:31,260
have cross-site scripting

215
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:34,690
vulnerabilities as much as we review

216
00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:37,120
code we've those have just sort of gone

217
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,010
away because we've we've learned about

218
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:45,790
that and and as he grew from you know

219
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:48,930
one to two to ten to now say 23 people

220
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:52,300
at some point I sold ingenuity and

221
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:54,250
actually went to work for and yet we

222
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:57,490
actually emerged the security practice

223
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:59,740
in right into the company and that's

224
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:02,520
where I had a really interesting

225
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:05,020
revelation I i I'm part of the company

226
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:08,250
now I can do more impact because I'm

227
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:11,680
internal right so secure all the things

228
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:15,280
I thought and yeah it doesn't work like

229
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,690
that you can't just come in and say

230
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:17,830
we're going to do this this this this

231
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:22,180
this this it just doesn't it doesn't

232
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:24,370
work like that I really learned that

233
00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:27,910
you have to take steps one at a time and

234
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:30,790
just iterate and do better and increment

235
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:34,029
or for a short period of time you're

236
00:11:34,029 --> 00:11:35,020
going to see it you're going to see an

237
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:36,190
improvement but then it's going to it's

238
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:38,380
going to die your people are going to go

239
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:40,570
back to their old habits and there's

240
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:42,490
huge push back to all the things that I

241
00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:44,740
wanted to do and we're still a couple

242
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:46,960
years later starting two imps continuing

243
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,790
to implement on that initial vision

244
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:50,500
we've had and so it's been it's been a

245
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:53,290
slow iterating process so the one

246
00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:56,500
interesting about education which I'm

247
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:59,520
going to go to this a little bit later

248
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:05,130
so why do we avoid during during dirt

249
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:08,410
avoid security why do we avoid doing it

250
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:11,440
one why was I getting a you know push

251
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,820
back on securing all the things and

252
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:14,920
things like that one of the big things

253
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:17,100
is ignorance we don't know we don't know

254
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:20,380
we also don't like to have things

255
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:23,350
pointed out when we do them wrong it's

256
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:25,420
it's it's the sonic it's not a good

257
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:28,330
feeling in any way we also procrastinate

258
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:31,330
it's it's way easier to procrastinate

259
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:33,910
and put off this adding those features

260
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:35,620
because it's really cool building the

261
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:38,020
new hotness right rather than figuring

262
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:39,640
out how to actually secure the new

263
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:42,640
hotness it's not you know it's not

264
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:44,650
particularly exciting work and it's not

265
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:47,200
rewarded it's sort of the inverse we get

266
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,350
we get shamed when something goes bad

267
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:54,240
but if it's working right and fine

268
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,890
things just move along it's not a

269
00:12:56,890 --> 00:12:57,970
problem until it's a problem it's

270
00:12:57,970 --> 00:12:59,529
there's a there's a good analogy Adam

271
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:02,560
was telling me about you know the people

272
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,940
who produced the sound for events like

273
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:08,350
this if my audio was just to cut out and

274
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:11,350
not work right or feedback or whatever

275
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:14,709
there's quick blame to go to the sound

276
00:13:14,709 --> 00:13:18,700
to the sound person but if it works

277
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:22,240
flawlessly it just works no one's going

278
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,040
to go give that guy a high-five that it

279
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:27,130
worked great it doesn't so when it when

280
00:13:27,130 --> 00:13:32,170
it goes wrong it just it goes wrong it's

281
00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:34,650
just not glamorous so one way to combat

282
00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:37,190
ignorance is through education

283
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:39,260
right we need you know which need to

284
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:41,780
sort of understand vulnerabilities and

285
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:44,480
this is where I welcome you to the

286
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:51,030
security community please wipe your feet

287
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:55,040
so as we learn about the things that we

288
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:58,280
learn we pass them on and just like that

289
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:02,560
seed crystal our community grows and

290
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:05,630
when I talk to developers I often get

291
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:08,330
asked about you know what is the new

292
00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:10,580
scary what's what's what does the

293
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:12,800
security community know that that I

294
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,660
don't know and that I should fix in my

295
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:20,330
app and and I'm going to tell you the

296
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:24,050
simple stuff still works it still works

297
00:14:24,050 --> 00:14:25,970
from years and years and years and years

298
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:27,860
ago when we found these vulnerabilities

299
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:30,670
and the information has been out there

300
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:34,100
we continue to go along this mobius

301
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:37,100
strip of development moving ahead and we

302
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:40,570
were not learning from our past mistakes

303
00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:44,000
we're just not doing it there's some

304
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:49,250
other things there too while I have you

305
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:51,230
captive we're going to sort of talk

306
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:52,760
about a few things that devs fine fine

307
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:54,410
scary well let's talk about a few sort

308
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:57,470
of tangible things i pulled my twitter

309
00:14:57,470 --> 00:15:00,680
feed and asked developers what they

310
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,180
cared about security wise and what they

311
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:05,950
found scary and difficult to implement

312
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:08,060
things that they thought that they were

313
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:11,690
going to screw up implementing and those

314
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:13,610
two things fell on the top validation

315
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:16,610
sanitization and crypto right my quest

316
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:17,660
already talked to you about content

317
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:19,310
injections so I'm not going to do that

318
00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:22,190
and you know about the ways to validate

319
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:24,350
and sanitize your data you know properly

320
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:26,210
in content security policy in those

321
00:15:26,210 --> 00:15:29,600
things and Martine talked about crypto a

322
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,630
bit if you want to learn more I think

323
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:34,820
you mentioned this the motto sano has a

324
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:36,589
crypto challenge where you can learn

325
00:15:36,589 --> 00:15:37,880
about building crypto systems and

326
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:40,010
breaking them I really recommend going

327
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:42,500
through those as a developer will level

328
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,600
up your game quite a bit when it comes

329
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:47,810
to crypto martine also suggested before

330
00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:50,329
the talk that i mentioned the core

331
00:15:50,329 --> 00:15:58,189
is on by Dan Bona Bona Bona on Krypto

332
00:15:58,189 --> 00:16:00,139
there's a there's a crypt of course it

333
00:16:00,139 --> 00:16:03,499
will blow your mind but it's a short

334
00:16:03,499 --> 00:16:06,170
course and it's worth it so I'm not

335
00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:07,730
going to talk about those things I'm

336
00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:09,709
going to talk about something that I'm a

337
00:16:09,709 --> 00:16:11,110
bit more familiar with it that is

338
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:14,540
JavaScript related it is not note conf I

339
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:17,149
realized but it is jas related all the

340
00:16:17,149 --> 00:16:21,529
same and it is npm we're using NPM to

341
00:16:21,529 --> 00:16:24,819
install a lot of things client-side code

342
00:16:24,819 --> 00:16:28,100
server-side code all the modules right

343
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:29,720
there's 40,000 plus modules out there

344
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,549
and the node security project is working

345
00:16:31,549 --> 00:16:34,429
on auditing those things and that came

346
00:16:34,429 --> 00:16:35,959
we started the project because we're

347
00:16:35,959 --> 00:16:39,170
trying to secure a product our product

348
00:16:39,170 --> 00:16:42,139
and bang it's built on node and we were

349
00:16:42,139 --> 00:16:45,019
finding ways to compromise the product

350
00:16:45,019 --> 00:16:46,730
we felt we had the car codebase really

351
00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:48,889
solid but we had one interesting thing

352
00:16:48,889 --> 00:16:53,269
we had we had code injection a bunch of

353
00:16:53,269 --> 00:16:55,220
people in this room were writing code

354
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:58,339
for our product right and they were

355
00:16:58,339 --> 00:17:00,559
injecting it into our app and I was you

356
00:17:00,559 --> 00:17:03,649
know basically trusting that that code

357
00:17:03,649 --> 00:17:05,539
was was good so it's looking for ways on

358
00:17:05,539 --> 00:17:07,039
how I could inject code into other

359
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:10,459
developers projects right how what what

360
00:17:10,459 --> 00:17:12,799
exists for vulnerabilities are so come

361
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:15,889
along NPM install CoffeeScript is this

362
00:17:15,889 --> 00:17:19,730
right no this is not right it's NPM

363
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:23,269
install coffee dash script and there's a

364
00:17:23,269 --> 00:17:24,679
number of developers out there that hate

365
00:17:24,679 --> 00:17:28,789
me for publishing the module so I

366
00:17:28,789 --> 00:17:30,590
actually took it down please don't put

367
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:33,649
it up please do not put it back up I

368
00:17:33,649 --> 00:17:36,529
mentioning this here and now because

369
00:17:36,529 --> 00:17:39,289
this is a problem we are a smart

370
00:17:39,289 --> 00:17:42,980
community everyone here is much smarter

371
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:44,389
than I am in terms of solving some of

372
00:17:44,389 --> 00:17:47,899
these problems we need to address this

373
00:17:47,899 --> 00:17:50,899
so what I did was I took the top 100

374
00:17:50,899 --> 00:17:53,899
modules and I did a typo analysis of

375
00:17:53,899 --> 00:17:56,240
those and then I did a passive analysis

376
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,220
on all the NPM blogs which the project

377
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:00,529
was gracious enough to give me so I

378
00:18:00,529 --> 00:18:01,639
didn't have to publish all of these

379
00:18:01,639 --> 00:18:02,830
modules and see what happened

380
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:06,220
and a lot of things bubble to the

381
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:12,580
surface package names with punctuation

382
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:15,039
dashes periods things like that get

383
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:16,570
misspelled way more often than other

384
00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:19,510
things but it's an interest it's a

385
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:20,860
really interesting attack surface is a

386
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:24,070
really big problem so when I publish

387
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:27,970
CoffeeScript it got 200 installs roughly

388
00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:30,460
in about a week and it took that long to

389
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:32,710
be discovered it did nothing it was

390
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:35,409
blank it had to read me if I hadn't

391
00:18:35,409 --> 00:18:36,700
mimic the behavior of coffeescript

392
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:38,500
chances are it would have taken a lot

393
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:41,919
longer to to be identified so there

394
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:45,789
there's my random scary for the for

395
00:18:45,789 --> 00:18:53,679
the talk so what else process right so

396
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:57,549
we go back to the the hey we can't make

397
00:18:57,549 --> 00:19:00,100
one hundred percent secure software it's

398
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:01,210
going to be processed it's going to

399
00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:03,120
exist and we're going to do it forever

400
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,710
what you can't do though is you can't

401
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:07,899
just shove process down in the face of

402
00:19:07,899 --> 00:19:09,940
developers and expect them to abide by

403
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:12,490
your your law of security in your

404
00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:14,919
organization it doesn't work I tried to

405
00:19:14,919 --> 00:19:17,340
do that and yet and they basically said

406
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:21,909
right we don't we don't love strict

407
00:19:21,909 --> 00:19:24,070
processes we work in in much different

408
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:27,370
ways and I'm sort of being vague 'insahn

409
00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:29,049
this because you need to find out what

410
00:19:29,049 --> 00:19:31,059
your processes for your team it's going

411
00:19:31,059 --> 00:19:37,929
to differ a lot for each team so let's

412
00:19:37,929 --> 00:19:41,980
see one other thing is that we can take

413
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:44,080
it we can taken a lesson from attackers

414
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:46,659
here and that we have a really

415
00:19:46,659 --> 00:19:47,679
interesting position inside of our

416
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:48,970
organization inside of our communities

417
00:19:48,970 --> 00:19:51,130
and that's that's a position that

418
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:53,080
attackers would love to be in insider

419
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:54,639
threat we can sort of turn that on its

420
00:19:54,639 --> 00:19:56,980
head right we're in a position where we

421
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:59,320
can effect change we can actually

422
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:02,950
influence and we can just change the

423
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:05,110
process it's it's not immutable it's

424
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:07,210
like code your habits your education

425
00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:10,299
there they're not mutable we can change

426
00:20:10,299 --> 00:20:13,250
them so

427
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:18,800
we need to wean do that we need to take

428
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,450
and change what your which how you're

429
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:23,480
approaching things and integrate

430
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:24,680
security and every basically every

431
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:26,390
aspect of the organization and do so

432
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:28,760
from you know if management doesn't care

433
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:32,330
well there's there's ways to help

434
00:20:32,330 --> 00:20:35,840
influence that just doing it and and

435
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:42,560
just sort of take over community bridge

436
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:46,130
all the world's so I want you to read a

437
00:20:46,130 --> 00:20:49,190
blog post by Adam brawl has published a

438
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:52,510
few days ago from some discussions in

439
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:56,570
topics at that happen at node conf and

440
00:20:56,570 --> 00:20:58,070
it talks about how to be a good

441
00:20:58,070 --> 00:21:01,160
community member in terms of other

442
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,570
development communities pointing and

443
00:21:02,570 --> 00:21:06,320
laughing and shaming we're we're really

444
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,690
good at that in the security community

445
00:21:08,690 --> 00:21:10,190
we're really good at pointing and

446
00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:12,920
laughing at all the code you write the

447
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:16,880
things that you do and we you know we

448
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:17,990
don't pull any punches right we

449
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:20,060
basically that that's what we're good at

450
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:22,550
and I used to think of myself not as a

451
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:25,280
not as a dev and earlier this year so I

452
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,320
used to think of myself just as a

453
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:29,930
security person trying to help

454
00:21:29,930 --> 00:21:32,330
developers and I dropped out on the

455
00:21:32,330 --> 00:21:33,620
floor earlier I dropped that trope

456
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:36,380
earlier and said ok I'm going to accept

457
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:38,480
that I'm a developer and I'm that I

458
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,130
belong in both communities I dropped

459
00:21:40,130 --> 00:21:42,680
that rope and now I'm just a bad dev I'm

460
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:45,260
just not like the code I right of

461
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:47,690
but I'm embracing that role which as

462
00:21:47,690 --> 00:21:51,380
soon as I embrace that role I can get

463
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:53,210
better I realize that this is my

464
00:21:53,210 --> 00:21:55,340
responsibility to learn how to do these

465
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:57,560
things better and I'm wondering if it's

466
00:21:57,560 --> 00:22:00,290
not time for developers to drop the

467
00:22:00,290 --> 00:22:02,150
trope that they aren't a little bit of

468
00:22:02,150 --> 00:22:04,400
security people or any other fringe

469
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,080
community that might be related to

470
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,150
development that maybe you should be

471
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:10,850
involved a little bit more in that and

472
00:22:10,850 --> 00:22:13,610
say well well i'm a bad security person

473
00:22:13,610 --> 00:22:18,350
i can get better one thin I realized why

474
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:19,670
devs don't join the security community

475
00:22:19,670 --> 00:22:21,920
is because we can be very abrasive in

476
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:23,990
crass and it's an unappealing place

477
00:22:23,990 --> 00:22:24,790
right we're not

478
00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:27,760
necessary that kind but we can combat

479
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:31,810
that come in numbers you know it'll be

480
00:22:31,810 --> 00:22:35,170
good the last thing that I want to plug

481
00:22:35,170 --> 00:22:38,490
sort of out of the blue something random

482
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:40,780
and what I think that we all should do

483
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:43,840
is we should put security down md files

484
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:48,820
in our projects it helps explain how you

485
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:50,380
want vulnerabilities disclosed in your

486
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:53,800
projects it helps communicate the

487
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,510
security constraints around your

488
00:22:55,510 --> 00:22:58,270
projects it tells how the constraints on

489
00:22:58,270 --> 00:22:59,290
which your project was designed

490
00:22:59,290 --> 00:23:01,300
communicate the things about security in

491
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:04,150
this file maybe it's just an email

492
00:23:04,150 --> 00:23:05,830
address i want vulnerabilities disclosed

493
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:08,170
here i want you to tell me here and give

494
00:23:08,170 --> 00:23:10,330
people a process if you want a good

495
00:23:10,330 --> 00:23:13,960
example JSE's they've got a fantastic

496
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:16,390
disclosure process it is a model for how

497
00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:18,210
we think how we should be doing things

498
00:23:18,210 --> 00:23:21,280
with with other JavaScript related

499
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:26,830
projects so I've got homework if you've

500
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:31,120
got nothing I want out of this at all do

501
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:35,340
this go to 0 asp look at the top 10

502
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:39,150
learn about one type of vulnerability I

503
00:23:39,150 --> 00:23:42,280
don't care what it is hopefully it's

504
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:43,810
something related to something that

505
00:23:43,810 --> 00:23:45,970
you're working on audit some of your

506
00:23:45,970 --> 00:23:49,570
code dig in if you don't understand it

507
00:23:49,570 --> 00:23:52,360
jump into some security communities IRC

508
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:55,450
channels try to interact and learn about

509
00:23:55,450 --> 00:23:58,450
that figure out how you can fix that

510
00:23:58,450 --> 00:24:00,460
vulnerability and then teach somebody on

511
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:02,440
your team about what you did just show

512
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:05,610
them over lunch that's going to take

513
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:07,720
you're going to be that seed crystal

514
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:09,970
that's going to start forming and start

515
00:24:09,970 --> 00:24:14,140
changing this community and I've got

516
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:15,370
some homework for you now so I'm going

517
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:16,870
to finish up about five minutes early

518
00:24:16,870 --> 00:24:19,660
you've got some comfort to do I want you

519
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:22,540
to take lunch as an opportunity to talk

520
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:25,150
to each other about what you do in terms

521
00:24:25,150 --> 00:24:27,430
of security some good questions are how

522
00:24:27,430 --> 00:24:28,990
do you handle security on your projects

523
00:24:28,990 --> 00:24:33,130
and if the answer is I don't come talk

524
00:24:33,130 --> 00:24:34,270
to me or find somebody else bring

525
00:24:34,270 --> 00:24:35,500
somebody else in and talk about it

526
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:37,540
what's a vulnerability that you've had

527
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:37,900
in your

528
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:39,610
what's a bug that's affected security

529
00:24:39,610 --> 00:24:41,440
and how have you addressed it tell those

530
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:45,880
stories talk to each other and that will

531
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:49,390
have an immediate and it will have a

532
00:24:49,390 --> 00:24:52,900
lasting impact on our community thank

533
00:24:52,900 --> 00:25:07,480
you
