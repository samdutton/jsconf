[Music]

2
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:24,050
hi everyone so I'm calm I'm from Vietnam

3
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:27,480
little bit about me I am full time react

4
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,849
native software engineer for a company

5
00:00:29,849 --> 00:00:33,780
named employment hero which is HR

6
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:36,719
platform from Australia before that I

7
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:40,370
make iOS app and build a server by

8
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:41,570
nodejs

9
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:44,760
so I'm here today to share with you guys

10
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:47,910
about tools that I'm curry working on to

11
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:51,239
serve my daily problem when I do the

12
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:54,570
coding please notice that I mentioned I

13
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:56,879
will mention a lot about react react

14
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:01,020
native Redux but if you from different

15
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:05,280
backgrounds like angular ember or view

16
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,409
you see tech benefit form the top so

17
00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:13,560
gallant they get stuff from my tools

18
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:17,900
that I used in my current workflow so

19
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:22,640
this is tools that I use daily because I

20
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,350
react native developer so I new chrome

21
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:29,579
dev tools to debug a new live load as

22
00:01:29,579 --> 00:01:33,000
well as react they're tuned and we redux

23
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,390
they're tuned to time travel and the

24
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:40,860
react hot daughter you know that tool

25
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:44,340
doesn't exist in vacuum they exist you

26
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:45,509
solve the problem

27
00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:49,170
and when I say tools I mean the tools

28
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:51,720
that help us to improve our productivity

29
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:56,790
and keep our sanity thing like when we

30
00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:00,860
change UI the page will immediately

31
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:05,070
update to reflect the changes or we can

32
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:08,970
easily spin point on the bug stuff like

33
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:13,390
that there's more tools like run and

34
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:17,409
webpack crucify grown-up chairs

35
00:02:17,409 --> 00:02:20,560
s-sarah but is that there are tasks

36
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,349
runner and a bill tooled and they are

37
00:02:23,349 --> 00:02:27,849
not the topic so i get started

38
00:02:27,849 --> 00:02:31,959
michael of time when I work on my first

39
00:02:31,959 --> 00:02:35,379
website it was a single page application

40
00:02:35,379 --> 00:02:39,849
that we completely on jQuery and the

41
00:02:39,849 --> 00:02:42,810
whole page with a check at the point

42
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:46,569
2010 people thought that I crazy because

43
00:02:46,569 --> 00:02:50,709
no one did that except for some big guy

44
00:02:50,709 --> 00:02:54,519
like Facebook Google but I did it anyway

45
00:02:54,519 --> 00:02:59,079
and my first experience when I try to

46
00:02:59,079 --> 00:03:02,260
debug is something like this

47
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:06,299
I knew this alert a lot when I try to

48
00:03:06,299 --> 00:03:11,650
debugging like to understand what is a

49
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:16,569
synchronous thing come back and if I

50
00:03:16,569 --> 00:03:20,829
look but you know it's work right we

51
00:03:20,829 --> 00:03:24,400
tried to I try to to file the bug and

52
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,810
it's work but it's not good it's not

53
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:31,180
good and then I knew about chrome dev

54
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:34,810
tools and it really makes my life easier

55
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:39,129
so this is the chrome dev tools you can

56
00:03:39,129 --> 00:03:41,799
do a lot of do a lot of stuff on this

57
00:03:41,799 --> 00:03:45,939
you can set the prac ponds check the

58
00:03:45,939 --> 00:03:48,220
corn-stack debug with a meaningful

59
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:50,909
meaning my code by using the source map

60
00:03:50,909 --> 00:03:54,099
beside that is has many feature like

61
00:03:54,099 --> 00:03:57,370
network performance timeline and let you

62
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:59,879
know about the information of your page

63
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:03,609
how I get render JavaScript and see

64
00:04:03,609 --> 00:04:06,030
there's performance and of course is

65
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:10,180
expecting Dom and star tinker matter

66
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:13,680
over time but this was a problem that

67
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,079
whenever I change the code and it

68
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:20,440
suppressed fi to reverse the page which

69
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:24,760
for me is very tedious thing and then I

70
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,820
find out the

71
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:31,360
the app named live reload it's claimed

72
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:35,800
to be a supreme developer to wonderland

73
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:38,050
a happy land where the browser don't

74
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:41,350
need a refresh button so whenever you

75
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:46,180
change your file is we also refers your

76
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:49,270
web page and if you church change the

77
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:51,940
image URL or just a test

78
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:54,669
it just update immediately without fully

79
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:59,800
refreshed your whole page and for your

80
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:03,370
information react native have the world

81
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:06,699
look live reload as a viewing feature

82
00:05:06,699 --> 00:05:11,139
and I'd use it every day so next let's

83
00:05:11,139 --> 00:05:14,620
talk about we are kept tuned so this is

84
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:18,220
real depth in chrome attention you can

85
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:21,340
see that you can do a lot of stuff with

86
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:24,220
it you can see the hierarchy of your

87
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:28,150
react app you can treat it props just

88
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:31,419
stayed as well as the infer and listener

89
00:05:31,419 --> 00:05:36,160
of your component and if you if you

90
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,970
redux you may not need but you know if

91
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:43,630
you if you use it there's a tool cone

92
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:46,990
without step tool which allow you do a

93
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:50,949
lot of thing list it can lock your

94
00:05:50,949 --> 00:05:54,610
action in many form and you can see what

95
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:57,010
action you just be patch with what

96
00:05:57,010 --> 00:06:00,099
payload and which part of your reduc

97
00:06:00,099 --> 00:06:03,820
star change by on that action there's a

98
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:05,169
feature called

99
00:06:05,169 --> 00:06:08,050
time travel which is a very cool one

100
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:12,340
that allow you to go backward something

101
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:15,090
like undo

102
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:18,460
like for example you have a login form

103
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:22,120
and you work and when you click the

104
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:24,490
login button the response from the

105
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:26,620
server it turns so fast then you cannot

106
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:29,919
see the loading indicator and what if

107
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:32,800
you just want to do a UI changes for

108
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:37,870
that loading indicator so just you time

109
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:40,230
travel then you can go back

110
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:42,630
like what so any point of time from the

111
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:47,010
past I will I will show you later if I

112
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:52,169
have enough of time and then we have a

113
00:06:52,169 --> 00:06:56,760
library cone react hot reload

114
00:06:56,760 --> 00:07:00,720
you can see on the screen is how can how

115
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:05,460
I can enable it on react native so what

116
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:08,760
it does is that is leverage the web pack

117
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,949
called Mattoon do loads to allow you to

118
00:07:10,949 --> 00:07:13,740
treat your components without losing the

119
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:16,530
state of your apps for example if you

120
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:18,210
are walking on the pavement screen and

121
00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:21,690
when you change is code I mean the

122
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:23,100
payment screen code

123
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:26,310
the app will update immediately and you

124
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:30,090
you still at the same screen but with

125
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:33,539
the newest code and you don't lose any

126
00:07:33,539 --> 00:07:35,729
stay of your app and anything that you

127
00:07:35,729 --> 00:07:41,760
input in the form still be there and for

128
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:45,090
me it's a big win because I don't need

129
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:49,500
to do a whole process like login pick up

130
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,780
the products and then go to the cart and

131
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:53,880
then checkout fielding the building

132
00:07:53,880 --> 00:08:00,110
information to get on the payment screen

133
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:04,229
but they're more so let's say you are

134
00:08:04,229 --> 00:08:08,130
feel developer or angular or amber there

135
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:11,070
are tools that help you to make your

136
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:15,440
life easier like future a step tool and

137
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:21,030
inspector angular every circle chair

138
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:24,720
step tool and a lot more each platform

139
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,120
and framework this has their own dev

140
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,490
tools which have developer is lease to

141
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:31,710
figure out what is the problem and and

142
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:35,339
how to fix it so the next question is

143
00:08:35,339 --> 00:08:40,770
are we there yet so I mean when I say

144
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:43,620
that I mean are we happy with our our

145
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:46,800
our current workflow is there anything

146
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:51,390
that we can improve on it so the thing

147
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:53,510
about my workflow again

148
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:56,380
so I start with the mock-up like

149
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:59,029
designer give you a screen and then

150
00:08:59,029 --> 00:09:02,300
based on that screen I can make react

151
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:04,610
component react native components based

152
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:06,500
on that mock-up and then I will

153
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:09,260
implement some business logic and then I

154
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:12,649
turn on my hot reload so that whenever I

155
00:09:12,649 --> 00:09:15,800
change the UI called or the business

156
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:18,100
logic the app will change accordingly

157
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:24,560
without using state yeah and then when

158
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:27,709
the bug comes with just you chrome dev

159
00:09:27,709 --> 00:09:30,260
tools to to figure out how you can fix

160
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:35,199
it and it's been pretty neat right but

161
00:09:35,199 --> 00:09:40,970
it's not this is one thing that we can

162
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:44,209
control is data from external services

163
00:09:44,209 --> 00:09:49,339
for example response of an API call like

164
00:09:49,339 --> 00:09:52,279
when we when you do a to do a pray you

165
00:09:52,279 --> 00:09:55,160
want to send a request to the server and

166
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:58,519
then get a respond back and then render

167
00:09:58,519 --> 00:10:01,639
whatever the server sent back to you but

168
00:10:01,639 --> 00:10:05,690
you do not have the power to to decide

169
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:07,459
what is a response that you want to

170
00:10:07,459 --> 00:10:14,690
forget and yeah there's a there's a walk

171
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:18,410
around solution such a we can have coat

172
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:22,519
the the data or we just use the mock

173
00:10:22,519 --> 00:10:27,050
server but those require code changes

174
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:30,620
and when you find yourself and ups with

175
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:34,250
you sitting back and forth between the

176
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:42,019
mouse server and the real API but how

177
00:10:42,019 --> 00:10:42,829
can we

178
00:10:42,829 --> 00:10:46,790
so how can we simulate the very 8 cases

179
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:50,420
like when the user login 5 time we want

180
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:52,250
to show our error message from the

181
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:55,970
server but do we want to just login 5

182
00:10:55,970 --> 00:10:59,750
time to just see the error message no I

183
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:06,630
don't so I create a tools

184
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:08,280
actually it's a chrome attention and

185
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:12,780
named it reason here's what it looked

186
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:16,950
like is there the gift I will play it

187
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:19,280
right now but what you are seeing is uh

188
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:22,410
you can see that is the chrome dev tool

189
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:26,700
and the reason up here is a panel beside

190
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:29,760
of the source map and the control and on

191
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,340
the left hand side very dummy

192
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:35,610
Lucky's login page which allow you to

193
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:39,360
enter your name and is it is this in the

194
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,420
database is will redirect you to the

195
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:44,790
dashboard if not and just display the

196
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:48,090
arrow the first time I will try with the

197
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:50,400
real API so it returned you and

198
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:54,680
authorized and then I turn on the mock

199
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:57,780
and then when I click login there's a

200
00:11:57,780 --> 00:12:00,750
button the green one I can click on that

201
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:03,870
and change the response to whatever I

202
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:08,680
want

203
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:13,350
so why reason why I make this chrome

204
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:19,470
attention so with reason you don't need

205
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:24,780
to have code anything and you can easily

206
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:29,750
to simulate the complex cases like

207
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:33,180
imagine that you need you have the form

208
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:36,270
and the first time the users submit that

209
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:39,870
form the server will return you repair

210
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:42,450
time our error message at the five

211
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:45,360
second but the second time it will

212
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:49,530
succeed how can you simulate that with

213
00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:52,050
your current workflow I think there's no

214
00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:56,700
way except you like change your code I

215
00:12:56,700 --> 00:13:01,890
have caught it but with the reason you

216
00:13:01,890 --> 00:13:07,590
can just type out whatever you want so

217
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:10,320
it will help you to simulate the

218
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,230
responses the only limitation is your

219
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:18,570
immunity date imagination I think in the

220
00:13:18,570 --> 00:13:20,460
future we

221
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:24,870
and have the feature like those cases we

222
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:29,310
can name it is scenario and when we find

223
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:31,710
out there's a scenario that we haven't

224
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:35,130
handled yet we can just export it I

225
00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:37,350
spawned a scenario from the reason and

226
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:39,450
then send it back to the other developer

227
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:42,630
in your team or your p.m. and say hey I

228
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:44,610
think there's a case that we didn't

229
00:13:44,610 --> 00:13:49,080
handle it properly and vision will

230
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:51,570
cross-platform even with the react

231
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:59,480
native okay so he's time for life demo

232
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:09,880
okay okay here we are

233
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:14,490
okay can you see it right so this is the

234
00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:18,480
example that I get from the Redux

235
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:21,750
response story so it's a very simple one

236
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:27,420
just just pull the latest news with the

237
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:29,040
keyword right here

238
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:34,830
forum graded so I will try to present

239
00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:42,570
again okay very fast okay I just proved

240
00:14:42,570 --> 00:14:45,300
with you that is actually fetch form

241
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:49,800
ready server and now what I gonna do is

242
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:54,600
that I will try to modify the response

243
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:57,930
from the server okay how I can do that

244
00:14:57,930 --> 00:15:07,530
I will turn it on and then I will click

245
00:15:07,530 --> 00:15:10,950
the refresh okay so now you see that the

246
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:14,450
whole page is in the loading state and

247
00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:19,050
there's a green button that his name is

248
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:21,120
released the request with the ID of the

249
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,230
request and then you just keep whatever

250
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:31,220
respond that you want

251
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:40,109
okay here I copy sorry I will pass the

252
00:15:40,109 --> 00:15:46,169
contents after respond sorry it's uh

253
00:15:46,169 --> 00:15:48,339
there's something wrong with the

254
00:15:48,339 --> 00:15:53,169
response so it doesn't highlight and all

255
00:15:53,169 --> 00:15:58,600
the time okay that's right I think it

256
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:08,210
doesn't work because I miss something

257
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:16,879
no please

258
00:16:16,889 --> 00:16:26,540
okay so this one should be like this

259
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:32,220
No yes Wow okay this one on so sorry

260
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:32,970
about this

261
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:39,750
I just happened because I just copy and

262
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:44,430
paste it but basically what it does is

263
00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:46,800
that when whenever I click return the

264
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:50,610
mock object is will respond the data

265
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:53,250
that I just enter instead of going to

266
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:56,510
the greatest server and and fetch that

267
00:16:56,510 --> 00:16:58,770
how can we fix it

268
00:16:58,770 --> 00:17:02,340
can you have one minute that I could lie

269
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:04,770
to fix it it's very cool and I really

270
00:17:04,770 --> 00:17:15,350
want to share with you

271
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:19,199
I are gonna do is I just checked the sin

272
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:23,370
tag because it's a JSON so if it's not

273
00:17:23,370 --> 00:17:26,309
in the correct format as we crash the

274
00:17:26,309 --> 00:17:34,860
app okay a lot of okay so it's there's a

275
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:37,970
lot of you know it should be like

276
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:40,830
instead of being like this is to be like

277
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:43,620
double collect this and because of the

278
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:47,280
editor so we cannot change

279
00:17:47,280 --> 00:18:01,850
Oh actually we can yeah that feature

280
00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:05,820
okay so I will save this one for if you

281
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:08,940
have if you want to see it just comes to

282
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:12,540
me after this talk and we will I will

283
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:15,510
show you this demo because a pretty sure

284
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:17,700
that when I click return is not gonna

285
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:20,669
work so you have to option whether you

286
00:18:20,669 --> 00:18:22,260
want to return the mock object or you

287
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:24,780
can forward it forwards mean that it

288
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:28,559
will fetch the real API instead of

289
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:33,059
return your mouth later you have time

290
00:18:33,059 --> 00:18:39,570
for for me to fix it yeah I think a

291
00:18:39,570 --> 00:18:41,910
minute we have I kind of computers now

292
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:47,100
about the result okay I will try to do a

293
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:51,110
fast way I can I just want to bring out

294
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:57,510
hello jazz conference give me one minute

295
00:18:57,510 --> 00:19:07,370
if it's not that I just give up

296
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:11,890
okay so I will go to just one double

297
00:19:11,890 --> 00:19:16,200
click on that okay

298
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:23,140
copy this vodka we crazy okay yeah we

299
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:26,310
trying to modify this a little bit

300
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:34,260
just hold on okay here okay

301
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:48,280
hi

302
00:19:48,290 --> 00:19:51,420
praise to the timeouts 10 second I

303
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:55,530
almost there okay got it

304
00:19:55,530 --> 00:20:04,560
so then we turn on the mark again and we

305
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:08,190
do the refresh and there's a button here
