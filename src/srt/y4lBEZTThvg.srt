1
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:18,480

so yeah I wanted to give a talk about

2
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,600
something that isn't cool like html5 or

3
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,820
JavaScript I also realize talking about

4
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:25,590
an HTML element at javascript conference

5
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:28,259
is risky I didn't actually expect them

6
00:00:28,259 --> 00:00:29,910
to where it might talk to even get

7
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:32,520
accepted so then I had to write

8
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:35,790
something about iframes but kind of in a

9
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:38,550
way I frames is all about JavaScript

10
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:40,829
like we hack the out of it and it

11
00:00:40,829 --> 00:00:46,020
does magical things but Amon of fun comp

12
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:48,559
did actually call me out on this and I

13
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:50,760
realized that now I've got my hipster

14
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:56,719
badge properly achieved now so that's me

15
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:02,339
right okay so um oh I did that about 4am

16
00:01:02,339 --> 00:01:04,710
last night right so the reason I'm

17
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:08,030
talking I frame is because I I built a

18
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:11,070
talk with Jay has been actually to like

19
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:13,860
help my colleagues instead of describing

20
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:15,570
in English what the problem was with

21
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:17,010
their bugs actually give me some code so

22
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:19,680
i could edit and so on so this is Jeff's

23
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,899
been in 2008 and this is jess been in

24
00:01:21,899 --> 00:01:25,619
2010 and this is jay has been in 2012 so

25
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:27,780
now there is a lot of iframe action

26
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:29,610
going on inside a spin and I kind of

27
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:32,820
learned a lot not learned a lot like

28
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:35,070
I've been with my frames since

29
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:38,579
2000 something so i wanted to share some

30
00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:42,719
of the things that I've done I wanted to

31
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:44,189
share some of the stories that people

32
00:01:44,189 --> 00:01:47,670
have shared with me and it's just a kind

33
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:50,909
of share the nasty iframe hacks talk

34
00:01:50,909 --> 00:01:53,310
that's that's what this talk is I'm not

35
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:54,329
only talking about any of the cool stuff

36
00:01:54,329 --> 00:01:57,240
that's coming in browsers there is

37
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,109
actually a really good slide deck

38
00:01:58,109 --> 00:01:59,549
they'll point to at the end of this this

39
00:01:59,549 --> 00:02:01,079
is all about the old with busted ship

40
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:05,039
that we do so this is the the history of

41
00:02:05,039 --> 00:02:07,619
the web all these beautiful lines and

42
00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:12,410
here you can see in one 1996 framesets

43
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:17,820
and as uncool as framesets are the

44
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:18,900
reason why they're interested in

45
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:22,290
netscape to and and the reason they were

46
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:24,930
there is as far as i understand is that

47
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:26,610
the internet connections were pretty

48
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:28,800
crappy and they didn't want to reload

49
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,470
entire pages every time so they create

50
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:32,610
the frame set so that you can have a

51
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:34,410
static block across the top and a static

52
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:37,350
sidebar static footer a curve reload

53
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:39,510
like just the center block content lead

54
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:41,250
that the content part which sounds

55
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:42,810
awfully familiar right that sounds like

56
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:46,620
Ajax that we have you know today the

57
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:48,570
downside is how we you know screwed up

58
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:50,610
Ajax it's it doesn't link very well and

59
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:52,680
people were you know losing astral

60
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:56,280
navigation and so on so it's all being

61
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,110
deprecated and shouldn't really work but

62
00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:00,810
it does work on an iphone for which I

63
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:04,200
was amazed it's completely I mean it's

64
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,030
not we haven't got position fixed

65
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:08,100
through hacking I for a frame sets but

66
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:09,840
it does actually work in brand new

67
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,150
browsers so old crappy busted technology

68
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:16,800
works in in ii browsers anyway so I

69
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,450
frames we got iframes in 1997 fire my

70
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:24,270
III I believe Scott Isaac I think a

71
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:26,190
Wikipedia page suggests that the eye is

72
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:30,570
from Isaac's and but I spoke to chris

73
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:32,040
wilson at microsoft and he said no

74
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:36,239
otherwise CSS would be CS s wilson

75
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:38,640
something they don't name that their

76
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,980
products after their themselves so it's

77
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:45,959
just I frames and the iframe was

78
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:48,480
deprecated in XHTML 1.1 so we're going

79
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,780
to lose iframes in you know HTML as we

80
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:54,590
know and love but IE being the amazing

81
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:58,050
amazing browser that it is didn't really

82
00:03:58,050 --> 00:03:59,880
support the alternative so the object

83
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:00,870
element was supposed to be the

84
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:04,350
alternative to iframes and because I e7

85
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:07,590
 it up a little bit it had the rest

86
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:08,820
it up a little bit it had the rest
of the browser support with iframes and

87
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:10,950
we continue to have iframes today for

88
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:13,440
some of the crazy stuff that we're doing

89
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:17,970
with iframes so if anyone's written any

90
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:20,310
bookmarklets this is the kind of thing I

91
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:23,220
was writing so to inject my bookmarklet

92
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:25,620
into the page I was writing document dot

93
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:27,570
get element by tag name head and then

94
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:30,240
append child for some reason I by

95
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,780
thought I'd read like back in early 2000

96
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:35,940
this is because of them of framesets

97
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:37,200
because there's no body element here

98
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:40,620
right so if you try and inject into the

99
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:42,110
body it's not there and you're

100
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:44,870
you're bookmarklet would fail something

101
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:47,150
i came across just recently is that if

102
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:49,010
you do want to use frame set still and

103
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:51,470
as an iframe talk but if you want to use

104
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:53,690
like framesets document body which is in

105
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:56,750
IE 5 and above but document.body points

106
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:58,880
to the the frameset even though it's not

107
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,010
the body of them and so if you want to

108
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:02,780
write bookmarks or document up body you

109
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:07,190
can do that all right but ok this is

110
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:11,900
what really showed us that I frames are

111
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:13,760
really quite powerful if you if you

112
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,230
force them to do things they're not

113
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:19,130
supposed to do so comet exists or we

114
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:22,370
could we could make use of comet using

115
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:24,830
iframes and this is a early snippet well

116
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:26,210
it's a abstraction of a snippet

117
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:28,250
basically create the iframe point it to

118
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:30,200
a streaming server because of

119
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,880
progressive rendering and the browser

120
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,560
you could give it a script tag with an

121
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,840
executor scripts and you pass that data

122
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,300
about so you know prices for instance

123
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:42,380
live prices and now on the server of

124
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:43,730
course we can use node and we can create

125
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:46,730
these these active sessions and just

126
00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:48,670
kind of push up data through the browser

127
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:51,620
alex russell coined the term comment in

128
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:54,500
2006 but the more you search on the web

129
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:57,470
you see examples of comet iframe hacks

130
00:05:57,470 --> 00:06:00,140
going way back to 2000 which is it's

131
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:03,470
pretty impressive i think and probably

132
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:06,560
one of the best hacks inside of gmail at

133
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:11,060
the time in 2006 is there i don't know

134
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:12,800
if this is true but apparently google

135
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,350
brought up the last few i ii engine is

136
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:17,240
to solve this kind of you know the

137
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:19,040
clicking problem that you hear in IE

138
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,570
when you hit refresh it kind of gives a

139
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:22,400
click noise and because they were using

140
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,640
iframes that hidden away on the page to

141
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,710
basically keep the connection open get

142
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:29,930
the new email you'd have to reload the

143
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:31,130
iframe every now and then otherwise

144
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:33,410
memory would go like ape and you

145
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:34,970
had to kind of close a connection so

146
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:36,080
you'd hear this little like click click

147
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,650
click click and what the what the gmail

148
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:42,680
code had inside of it was an iframe gets

149
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:46,490
created then inside of that they put an

150
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:49,930
activex object the html5 the HTML file

151
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:53,360
acts of x object which is opened and

152
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,610
then an iframe is put inside of that the

153
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:59,509
went to the live stream of data and when

154
00:06:59,509 --> 00:07:03,259
that reloads the that the ActiveX HTML

155
00:07:03,259 --> 00:07:05,180
file thing doesn't it suppresses the

156
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:07,129
noise so they solve this with like

157
00:07:07,129 --> 00:07:10,039
iframe activex by frame probably an

158
00:07:10,039 --> 00:07:11,479
iframe somewhere else as well just to

159
00:07:11,479 --> 00:07:14,080
you know keep the iframe stack going

160
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,879
that was pretty cool and bit barmy and

161
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:21,560
like who would know that so this is

162
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,509
these are my experiments with iframes

163
00:07:23,509 --> 00:07:28,310
the public and 2007 I i needed to i was

164
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:29,389
working with a lot of other developers

165
00:07:29,389 --> 00:07:33,860
and like polluting global scope is a bad

166
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:37,729
thing sort of anyway i need to work out

167
00:07:37,729 --> 00:07:39,319
where the global where the variables are

168
00:07:39,319 --> 00:07:41,289
being introduced and i came out of

169
00:07:41,289 --> 00:07:44,060
basically using an iframe to detect

170
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:46,069
where the global variable to being

171
00:07:46,069 --> 00:07:48,979
issues by comparing them against the

172
00:07:48,979 --> 00:07:53,620
current global scope and KAG kagak

173
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:56,000
pronounced that perfection kills calm he

174
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,039
then took that a few years later and

175
00:07:58,039 --> 00:07:59,539
kind of cleaned it up and fixed it and

176
00:07:59,539 --> 00:08:05,900
made it better so the sum of the things

177
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:07,099
I'm going to talk about this this part

178
00:08:07,099 --> 00:08:09,979
are partly iframe hacks that I've come

179
00:08:09,979 --> 00:08:13,370
across and also kind of my experience of

180
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:16,339
J's bin and how i'm using iframes to

181
00:08:16,339 --> 00:08:18,409
share with you guys and girls and so on

182
00:08:18,409 --> 00:08:21,409
so probably I mean you may have heard of

183
00:08:21,409 --> 00:08:23,599
this one already the this is not

184
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:25,759
obviously Jay has been the samsung s3

185
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:29,509
remote wipe you send someone an HTML

186
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:31,250
page with that but has that phone it

187
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:33,079
will just wipe their phone back to

188
00:08:33,079 --> 00:08:36,110
factory settings and the clap is for the

189
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:40,130
engineers that let that one through this

190
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:42,050
isn't an HTML deck by the way it's a

191
00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:45,290
screencast a gif and make a video and

192
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:48,980
put that in keynote so but there are a

193
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:50,390
few things like this where you can kind

194
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:52,310
of point them to appoint an iframe to

195
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:53,810
something and it will kind of somehow

196
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:57,470
work and there was a time in iOS the if

197
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:59,420
you wanted to play background music on

198
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:01,579
your web page which I know there's a lot

199
00:09:01,579 --> 00:09:03,890
of you want to do that you could um it

200
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:06,470
could point the iframe to an mp3 or WAV

201
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:08,149
file and it would just play in the

202
00:09:08,149 --> 00:09:09,500
background of the the iphone

203
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:13,280
pretty awesome they they did either fix

204
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:15,530
it or break it depending on that like

205
00:09:15,530 --> 00:09:16,880
how much music you like in your web

206
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,220
pages but it doesn't work anymore

207
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:24,140
unfortunately so the iframes that I work

208
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:26,270
with are often like dynamic generator

209
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:27,710
you create an iframe you drop it into

210
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:31,250
the DOM and you start writing like HTML

211
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:33,350
into it or whatever you want to do but

212
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:35,660
though the way that you you right

213
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:36,830
through it is you need to get the window

214
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:40,130
object for that iframe but you can only

215
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:43,070
get it once it's inside the Dom so if

216
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:44,780
you don't put the iframe enter the Dom

217
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:46,880
the window for that iframe does not

218
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:50,750
exist so it's how you get it out this

219
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:52,610
will be some code where I'm injecting

220
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:54,860
some HTML basically this this awesome

221
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:58,330
HTML is my awesome HTML and this is

222
00:09:58,330 --> 00:10:00,320
fundamentally what Jay has been does as

223
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,880
you type it just makes an iframe and

224
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,710
keeps kind of injecting your code as you

225
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:09,320
go along it's a kind of a not a quark

226
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,640
this is obvious when you think about it

227
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:13,190
but the load event doesn't fire on the

228
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:15,830
iframe until you close like do document

229
00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:17,480
or close once you finish right to it and

230
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:20,030
the reason that's obvious is that when

231
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:21,410
you have a web page and it's taking a

232
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:23,780
long time to load like if it's if it

233
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:25,940
keeps the connection open the load event

234
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:27,680
doesn't doesn't fire because it's still

235
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,120
loading right so we've got the same

236
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,620
problem until we hit the clothes until

237
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:33,640
we call close the load event won't fire

238
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:37,340
so something to if you're listening for

239
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:40,540
when it's loaded to pull stuff out again

240
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:42,770
so you don't have the window object

241
00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:44,330
until you put it into the Dom but

242
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:46,100
equally if you take the iframe out of

243
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:47,930
the Dom the the whole thing gets

244
00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:49,940
destroyed and it again it kind of makes

245
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:51,380
sense like hitting clothes on the tab

246
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:53,960
you basically close that window entirely

247
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:56,000
but any javascript that was running has

248
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,450
been killed and when you put it back in

249
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:01,250
the Dom it'll just rerun everything as

250
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:03,460
if you judge just hit refresh basically

251
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:06,860
I include the slide I found this weird

252
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:09,170
bug which really doesn't apply to anyone

253
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:12,320
except for me but if you if you would

254
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,230
like some webkit browser and opera they

255
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:19,510
ignore the mime type on CSS basically

256
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:22,580
the point of this is that if you have an

257
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:23,420
iframe and

258
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:24,890
rendering if you do in kind of live

259
00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:27,500
previews or rendering HTML into an

260
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:30,950
iframe it's not the exact same thing as

261
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:32,960
the full kind of web page and I frame is

262
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:35,330
very slightly different to the regular

263
00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:37,910
kind of web view in a way like mobile

264
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:39,350
safari is different to web view for

265
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:41,900
instance so I want to talk about some of

266
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:43,580
the preview stuff I do enjoy a spin so

267
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:46,970
it Jasmine if you type it renders live

268
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:49,310
preview as you're coding so you changed

269
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:51,470
some CSS it will actually you know make

270
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:53,420
the change immediately which is we're in

271
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:55,250
this kind of like impatient era where

272
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:56,840
everything needs to be lives and real

273
00:11:56,840 --> 00:12:00,650
time so achieving that takes a few kind

274
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:05,980
of little hacks and the first one was

275
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:09,590
iframes don't know half the browser's

276
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:12,170
the iframe doesn't know how wide it is

277
00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:13,430
so if you have something like a canvas

278
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:16,370
that you want to do a full width so you

279
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:18,740
know the code run do you do canvas top

280
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:21,800
width equals window dot inner HTML in in

281
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:27,110
it with WebKit browsers and opera one of

282
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:28,490
the other browsers they don't know about

283
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:31,190
the width is zero until the next tick so

284
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:33,440
you know like process next a core set

285
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,930
timeout so on so I wrote this pretty

286
00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:39,280
clever code that makes another iframe

287
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:44,450
set a call back and on the globe on my

288
00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:46,520
window object and when the iframe runs

289
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:48,340
it calls that callback with the width of

290
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:52,040
the iframe and if it's zero it says

291
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:54,410
don't run the code so i have this bit

292
00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:57,640
that says if there's an active delay

293
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:00,890
then do a set timeout 0 otherwise we're

294
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:04,130
on the code immediately and I say clever

295
00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:05,240
code because actually it's complete

296
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,860
waste of time all I should have done is

297
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:11,270
set timeout run so that was the basic

298
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:12,380
meet but just trying to be too clever

299
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:13,970
for my own good and only realize that

300
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:17,180
whilst writing this this deck but if

301
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:18,080
you're doing anything where you actually

302
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,430
need to know the width you need to wait

303
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:25,010
until the next like render yeah so what

304
00:13:25,010 --> 00:13:26,660
I do enjoy a spin to make sure that you

305
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:29,330
don't block so when you're typing if you

306
00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:31,730
had an alert box as you type your code

307
00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:33,410
it could just like bring up an alert box

308
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:35,750
an entirely block the UI you wouldn't be

309
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:37,190
able to continue typing with their pain

310
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:39,650
us so I actually put in the scripts just

311
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:41,510
at the top of everything just the top

312
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:44,630
before your code that just sets alert

313
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:47,570
confirm and prompt and maybe the print

314
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:49,730
box as well to like an empty function

315
00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:51,860
basically like a no-op function and then

316
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:53,060
at the end of the the code actually

317
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:56,000
remove it so an alert box can run but it

318
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,530
won't run whilst you're typing so you

319
00:13:57,530 --> 00:13:59,500
don't have this kind of interruption

320
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:03,770
oddly opera completely suppresses alerts

321
00:14:03,770 --> 00:14:06,920
or any blocking like dialogue inside of

322
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:09,410
an iframe which also suggests that the

323
00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:11,240
iframe is slightly different again to

324
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:15,740
the main window so I haven't really

325
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:17,930
bothered checking how how far different

326
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:22,490
is but it it's a different environment

327
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:26,210
basically i remove also focus when i'm

328
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:27,560
dropping into the iframe so I'm looking

329
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:29,390
at your HTML and I'm removing the

330
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:30,770
autofocus again because if you want if

331
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:32,510
you're typing away on one side you don't

332
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:34,580
want the cursor to suddenly jump to an

333
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:39,020
input element right and i spoke to

334
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:42,380
richard worth at the last year's conf in

335
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:45,440
the u.s. who was working on jquery UI

336
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:49,010
and as he was coding he would be using

337
00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:54,320
like the the the jquery dialogue plugin

338
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,850
which would then grab focused so

339
00:14:55,850 --> 00:14:57,890
anything that grabs focus anyone live

340
00:14:57,890 --> 00:14:59,060
render is going to take you away from

341
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:01,930
your like your coding basically so i

342
00:15:01,930 --> 00:15:05,240
cancel any focus events on the window

343
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:07,970
object inside of the iframe and you just

344
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:10,160
do that by doing window dot add event

345
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:13,130
listener or just on focus and then

346
00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:15,590
cancel the event it means it'll focus

347
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:17,060
all the way through the iphone the

348
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:20,180
iframe but it won't force focus on the

349
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:22,700
kind of the the outer window da that the

350
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:25,700
window will work again basically I do

351
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:27,860
things like restoring scroll positions

352
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:29,839
because if you again you got like a long

353
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:31,790
page and your coding your re-rendering

354
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:33,440
iframes you want to get it at the same

355
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:38,300
point and so that that's kind of live

356
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:39,650
rendering these are these are other

357
00:15:39,650 --> 00:15:43,310
tricks that we can use iframes and like

358
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:45,800
I said Kang Kang acts upgraded the

359
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,300
scripts you basically create an iframe

360
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:49,100
to detect Global's all it does is

361
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:50,870
compare all

362
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:53,210
global variables on the window element

363
00:15:53,210 --> 00:15:54,800
compared to the iframe and the

364
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,900
difference is any newly introduced

365
00:15:56,900 --> 00:16:02,839
global variable phonegap uses uses

366
00:16:02,839 --> 00:16:05,120
iframes were called over users iframes

367
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:08,000
in iOS but the interesting but I was

368
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,330
talking to Brian last night if there's a

369
00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:15,680
network request made whilst you have

370
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,420
input focus so you have the keyboard up

371
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:19,300
if there's a network request that's made

372
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:22,370
the keyboard will drop away but this

373
00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:24,890
only happens in the webview not in

374
00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:27,470
Safari like that the main browser which

375
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:29,960
may not be a problem except Chrome for

376
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,970
Android or Chrome for iOS is a webview

377
00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:36,320
so this actually is happening to JSP lat

378
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,520
moment because as you type it's saving

379
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:40,250
and it's doing an xhr safe so you have

380
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:42,020
focus your typing some code and then the

381
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:44,240
keyboard just vanishes and then you tap

382
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,920
and it brings back and you type and it

383
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,020
vanishes because it's doing an xhr

384
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:49,370
request is doing a network request and

385
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:51,980
the way the phonegap the phonegap guys

386
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:54,470
solved this problem is you just wrap it

387
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:56,779
in an iframe of course right that will

388
00:16:56,779 --> 00:16:58,850
solve every problem eventually you put

389
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:01,480
the network request inside of the iframe

390
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:09,890
keyboards laser random um I wanted in

391
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:13,850
J's bin to be able to point by in the

392
00:17:13,850 --> 00:17:16,220
URL just do J's bin gist and the idea of

393
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:18,530
a gist and I wanted to suck the gist

394
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:22,360
into jo spin now either because i'm lazy

395
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:24,620
or because it didn't exist and it's

396
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:27,500
probably the former i couldn't i didn't

397
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,630
bother looking at the the proper api

398
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:31,940
that github provide and it's possible

399
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:33,890
that it wasn't there in the first place

400
00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:36,050
but they do have a script in bed so you

401
00:17:36,050 --> 00:17:37,730
can embed just onto your website and

402
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:39,980
equally like lanyard you can you can

403
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:44,000
embed like like this conference is doing

404
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,440
embedding the actual upcoming talks if

405
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:51,830
you put that in an iframe because

406
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:55,130
everything belongs in iframe you can

407
00:17:55,130 --> 00:17:57,260
wait until it's loaded and then drop

408
00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:58,700
into the iframe because it's all hidden

409
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:00,980
away and pull all of that content out

410
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:03,860
again but as an object or as an API so

411
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:04,740
you can create an eight

412
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:07,800
I if if a website provides a script

413
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:08,940
include that we're just kind of like

414
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:11,309
drop in a bunch of HTML if you put that

415
00:18:11,309 --> 00:18:13,710
into an iframe wait for the iframe to

416
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:15,390
load you can traverse the Dom nodes that

417
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:18,000
are in there and pull them out as just

418
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,250
you know values as an object that

419
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:22,230
represents like the the upcoming talks

420
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:25,160
and you can present it in your own way

421
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:27,870
so basically creating third party a

422
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:30,150
crust mapi is out the potty script

423
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:32,370
embeds the only thing I have been told

424
00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:34,110
to say is there's usually T's and C's

425
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:38,760
that require you kind of credit lanyard

426
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:40,770
for instance so just read those and

427
00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:44,690
don't blame me if you get into trouble

428
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:47,429
cross-domain communication is kind of

429
00:18:47,429 --> 00:18:51,150
the big bit that I frames good for I've

430
00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:53,880
used this with the JS consoles like it's

431
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,710
just a full-screen console i could write

432
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:58,320
some JavaScript and I gain out of

433
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:01,110
laziness I was asked to debug an Android

434
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:03,240
app and I couldn't be bothered to read

435
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:05,700
the documentation for the SDK to work

436
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:08,240
out how console.log works so I changed

437
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,650
j/s console to have this remote feature

438
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:12,720
which just drop in a script tag into

439
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,540
your page and the console is able to

440
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:17,610
control the mobile phone and consulate

441
00:19:17,610 --> 00:19:19,290
logs come out into the desktop but I did

442
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:23,190
that with a bunch of iframes and i think

443
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:26,610
is and maybe socket i/o use iframes as

444
00:19:26,610 --> 00:19:28,559
like the last resort to assault on these

445
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:32,100
problems you have to bear with my

446
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:34,530
diagram here right so there's a video of

447
00:19:34,530 --> 00:19:38,820
the remote working and but you have you

448
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:41,610
include this script that points to JS

449
00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:45,390
consort calm and that creates a console

450
00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:46,980
object and cover overrides the actual

451
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:49,640
one inside of your page but it create it

452
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,720
creates an iframe that points back to

453
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:54,480
jas console calm and then uses post

454
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,700
message and I'll message communicate in

455
00:19:56,700 --> 00:20:00,330
and out of that that I frame and then

456
00:20:00,330 --> 00:20:03,510
the iframe can then point back to Jess

457
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:05,910
console calm and communicate using Ajax

458
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:09,600
posts an event source the reason i jump

459
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:10,920
through all these hoops to do this is

460
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,450
because i wanted to be at a test us on

461
00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:15,179
phones like Windows Phone or old Android

462
00:20:15,179 --> 00:20:18,330
phones that don't have I think

463
00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:20,279
don't have flash so I couldn't polyfill

464
00:20:20,279 --> 00:20:22,799
web sockets for instance so I'm using a

465
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:26,519
combination of like I photo frames post

466
00:20:26,519 --> 00:20:29,220
message and on message event source and

467
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:33,179
Ajax to get a message like basically web

468
00:20:33,179 --> 00:20:40,620
sockets yeah one of the so with Jeff

469
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:43,049
spin again I wanted to be able to

470
00:20:43,049 --> 00:20:48,240
support pointing a phone at the like the

471
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,470
URL that you're working on at the time

472
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:51,419
so you're writing some code I want to be

473
00:20:51,419 --> 00:20:53,100
able to point that phone at that that

474
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:56,070
code and have it kind of live render and

475
00:20:56,070 --> 00:20:57,630
it does that now but the way I first

476
00:20:57,630 --> 00:21:00,299
looked at it is by wrapping in an iframe

477
00:21:00,299 --> 00:21:02,669
and having the iframe keep an active

478
00:21:02,669 --> 00:21:05,340
connection to the server and just sorry

479
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:06,840
the like the top-level window we then

480
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:08,490
just reload the iframe the whole time

481
00:21:08,490 --> 00:21:10,889
and the first problem i encountered was

482
00:21:10,889 --> 00:21:14,460
the viewport is ignored when our window

483
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:19,649
is in an iframe on phone so the text is

484
00:21:19,649 --> 00:21:21,179
very small obviously didn't work as a

485
00:21:21,179 --> 00:21:23,899
solution so I threw that way as a bug

486
00:21:23,899 --> 00:21:27,000
but actually someone sent me a tweet

487
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,460
saying they use iframes around windows

488
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:31,019
on phones to be able to see the full

489
00:21:31,019 --> 00:21:34,380
like view of a page so it's kind of a

490
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:35,519
bug or a feature depending on how you

491
00:21:35,519 --> 00:21:36,690
look at it if you actually want to see

492
00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:39,120
the full width of a page because you

493
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,549
don't want to have like a mobile version

494
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:47,549
stick it in my frame so the document dr.

495
00:21:47,549 --> 00:21:50,100
main thing this is them this is what

496
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:52,500
allows like twitter com to talk to an

497
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,870
iframe the points to api doc twitter.com

498
00:21:54,870 --> 00:21:57,389
for instance what they do is both on

499
00:21:57,389 --> 00:21:58,799
just on both windows they just say

500
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:01,289
document on a domain equals twist calm

501
00:22:01,289 --> 00:22:03,960
and at that point they have the same

502
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:06,149
origin rules allows them to dip inside

503
00:22:06,149 --> 00:22:09,139
of each other call methods and so on so

504
00:22:09,139 --> 00:22:12,740
that's kind of the the opener to cross

505
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:15,809
across two main not quite cross domain

506
00:22:15,809 --> 00:22:17,789
but like between see nose basically to

507
00:22:17,789 --> 00:22:20,600
be able to communicate between iframes

508
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:24,330
comets obviously the the for me at least

509
00:22:24,330 --> 00:22:25,769
the most impressive thing has come out

510
00:22:25,769 --> 00:22:28,889
why frames and I stole this from Alex

511
00:22:28,889 --> 00:22:30,250
sextons talk we

512
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:31,810
Shh i have a link in the notes but

513
00:22:31,810 --> 00:22:34,660
that's no good to you basically boils

514
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:37,330
down to this is kind of how calm it

515
00:22:37,330 --> 00:22:39,880
would work if a dot-com is your website

516
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,350
and beer calm is your life server that

517
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:44,950
can stream data up you can then put an

518
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:49,000
iframe inside of be calm and send it

519
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,370
data and a calm at the bottom can talk

520
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:55,600
to a calm at the top basically if it's

521
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,100
on the same origin it can penetrate all

522
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:58,270
the way down and all the way back up

523
00:22:58,270 --> 00:23:00,490
again which is kind of weird you can

524
00:23:00,490 --> 00:23:02,110
have like Paul was talking about having

525
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:05,770
lots of nested I frames and but a calm

526
00:23:05,770 --> 00:23:07,540
can point back to a dot-com at the top

527
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:10,210
level by just doing top dot course on

528
00:23:10,210 --> 00:23:13,270
function give us some data that you need

529
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:14,980
to know your way through all of those

530
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:17,070
iframes you need together I actually

531
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:19,660
talked to them by name and to get

532
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:21,280
through I have some examples that i

533
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:24,700
might post out later to prove this and

534
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:28,750
this is a if you want to there's a weird

535
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:30,940
hack I don't understand why this works

536
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:32,680
but if you want to communicate with an

537
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:35,110
iframe and give it some data regardless

538
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:37,270
of whether it's on the same origin or

539
00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:39,910
not if you do window dot name and give

540
00:23:39,910 --> 00:23:43,000
it some data it'll the the iframe will

541
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,360
have accessed that so this works across

542
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:47,680
domain which I don't understand why I

543
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:49,180
think it might just be broken in every

544
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:51,190
browser see you you have an iframe

545
00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:53,520
pointing to twitter com and if you

546
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:56,890
immediately do i frame go point to the

547
00:23:56,890 --> 00:23:59,890
dom node and do dot name equals some

548
00:23:59,890 --> 00:24:02,710
data like JSON string twitter com will

549
00:24:02,710 --> 00:24:04,270
be at a read window lock name and it

550
00:24:04,270 --> 00:24:08,650
will contain that data and also it's a

551
00:24:08,650 --> 00:24:10,900
way of passing data to an iframe before

552
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:13,150
the actual load event fires so if it's

553
00:24:13,150 --> 00:24:17,410
like a long lasting iframe you can you

554
00:24:17,410 --> 00:24:18,790
can pass them date of the wind up name

555
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:20,530
it will have it up front basically we

556
00:24:20,530 --> 00:24:22,390
have it before the Dom has loaded or

557
00:24:22,390 --> 00:24:25,590
anything like that yeah weird

558
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:27,520
clickjacking obviously one of the

559
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:28,720
coolest things we got out of iframes

560
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:29,890
stick an iframe on top of a button

561
00:24:29,890 --> 00:24:31,660
you've tweeted for me you poopin to

562
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:36,040
yourself but that's preventable in ie9

563
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:38,620
above and by above i mean everyone else

564
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:41,230
of course by just sending a header that

565
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:43,890
says you can

566
00:24:43,890 --> 00:24:45,810
this unless you're on the same origin so

567
00:24:45,810 --> 00:24:47,760
google com twitter com they all send

568
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,560
this header which means that if i put an

569
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:51,930
i frame around it it's not going to load

570
00:24:51,930 --> 00:24:53,310
it just fails to load it throws an

571
00:24:53,310 --> 00:24:57,960
exception and nothing happens at all so

572
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:00,050
this is probably one of the newer

573
00:25:00,050 --> 00:25:03,110
interesting hacks that that I've seen

574
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:09,020
iframes being used for you can use it

575
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:11,220
this is a little tricky but you can use

576
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:16,080
it to have URLs that have unknown

577
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:20,070
unknown paths like Jo spin has like 80 /

578
00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:24,680
ABC / 1 or 2 and so on you can have it

579
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:29,280
load your manifest using an iframe all

580
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:32,700
right so basically you have you have

581
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:34,800
your regular application okay this comes

582
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,690
from lanyard and Jake Archibald kind of

583
00:25:36,690 --> 00:25:39,500
he mentions it in his douchebag talk I

584
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:41,460
talked to him a bit more detail and this

585
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:43,350
is this how it work so you have your

586
00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:46,020
application chrome so Jo spin the the

587
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:49,080
user content is just a adjacent include

588
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:51,450
so the whole application is the the

589
00:25:51,450 --> 00:25:53,940
chrome so if that could work offline all

590
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:56,430
I need is the URLs to work and the user

591
00:25:56,430 --> 00:26:01,970
content to work so the root path is my

592
00:26:01,970 --> 00:26:06,000
application chrome on any URL that isn't

593
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,330
on the root path so / ABC / 1 you

594
00:26:09,330 --> 00:26:11,880
include an iframe the points to a very

595
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,680
light page maybe not actually the the

596
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:15,330
app but this very like page it has a

597
00:26:15,330 --> 00:26:16,980
manifest inside of it and the manifest

598
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:20,550
points to your your your application

599
00:26:20,550 --> 00:26:22,710
chrome so the assets the JavaScript and

600
00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:26,280
the the HTML actually drives that chrome

601
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:30,810
that app and a manifest says fallback

602
00:26:30,810 --> 00:26:33,750
anything on the the root path to the

603
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:38,160
root URL so this bit here says if i go

604
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:42,450
to Jasmine calm / ABC / 10 and I'm

605
00:26:42,450 --> 00:26:47,100
offline it will serve up the web page

606
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:50,970
it's on this URL so any URL now works

607
00:26:50,970 --> 00:26:54,990
and my content is coming back

608
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,910
and it means that I can I can basically

609
00:26:57,910 --> 00:27:01,510
have support unknown URLs inside of J's

610
00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:03,040
bin or this is what they're doing for

611
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:07,450
land use so if there's a an event that

612
00:27:07,450 --> 00:27:09,760
isn't already in your in your cash and

613
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,140
you haven't got internet connection they

614
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:11,980
can still serve up the application

615
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:16,270
chrome basically it kind of works as

616
00:27:16,270 --> 00:27:19,960
well I it would help season code and but

617
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:21,570
i'm not going to show you any code and

618
00:27:21,570 --> 00:27:25,120
but in theory you should be ever using

619
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,860
like that same iframe technique to

620
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:30,790
basically keep a hot cache of like a

621
00:27:30,790 --> 00:27:33,190
very large javascript library you can

622
00:27:33,190 --> 00:27:35,680
have in a hidden iframe always available

623
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:37,390
and always being delivered to your main

624
00:27:37,390 --> 00:27:39,670
application this is just the theory I do

625
00:27:39,670 --> 00:27:41,230
one have a play but this is kind of the

626
00:27:41,230 --> 00:27:43,720
the newest thing I've seen iframes being

627
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:47,140
used so the good parts just going to

628
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:48,370
mention them there's a really really

629
00:27:48,370 --> 00:27:50,320
good slide deck that you can get quite a

630
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,850
bit information out just like looking at

631
00:27:51,850 --> 00:27:55,060
the slides they talk about how they

632
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:59,500
implement iframes with discuss but

633
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:01,120
there's a postmessage anon message which

634
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:03,960
is it has some decent support ish

635
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:05,980
there's a seamless property which

636
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:08,710
basically gets rid of the border as far

637
00:28:08,710 --> 00:28:09,760
as i can tell i think you're supposed to

638
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:11,380
be either use CSS to start all the way

639
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:14,350
into the the iframe saw stock means that

640
00:28:14,350 --> 00:28:17,230
you can put HTML on an attribute of an

641
00:28:17,230 --> 00:28:21,040
HTML tag which looks ugly as and

642
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:22,750
then we've got these sandbox properties

643
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:25,870
which stop jobs from running if we don't

644
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:31,090
want it if we untrusted domain so that's

645
00:28:31,090 --> 00:28:34,600
my my kind of like brain fart on iframe

646
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,520
hacks the one big one I didn't include

647
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:40,450
actually is sandboxing so basically

648
00:28:40,450 --> 00:28:42,910
creating a sandbox to create a like a

649
00:28:42,910 --> 00:28:45,580
fresh perfectly clean version of an

650
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:47,680
array object d Neville's did a lot of

651
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:50,740
work on this while back but I wanted to

652
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:52,030
talk about some kind of the weird a bit

653
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:54,280
so that's me done I can't see a

654
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:56,499
thing
