00:00:13,059 --> 00:00:14,440
>> Hiya.

2
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:18,099
What's happening!

3
00:00:18,099 --> 00:00:22,710
I'm really happy to be here, and to talk to
you about a topic that is very close to my

4
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:23,710
heart.

5
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:28,730
Today, I want to talk with you about comics,
and more specifically, I want to show you

6
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:32,910
some of the great things that I found on the
internet, and how to create comics on the

7
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:40,579
web and the learning I had when I tried to
create my very own web comic and how to make

8
00:00:40,579 --> 00:00:46,730
this comic actually accessible, not only for
a few or some but, actually, for literally

9
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:47,909
everyone.

10
00:00:47,909 --> 00:00:55,210
This topic is so close to my heart because
as many of you here in the audience, I'm a

11
00:00:55,210 --> 00:00:58,430
great fan of comics myself.

12
00:00:58,430 --> 00:01:03,050
I can remember when I was young, I would go
to the comic book store, or maybe to the corner

13
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:10,049
shop and grab a magazine, sometimes like even
hard-cover comic books, and try to learn more

14
00:01:10,049 --> 00:01:15,030
about the stories and the adventures of my
favourite protagonists and heroes.

15
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:18,100
I think most of you can actually relate to
this.

16
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:22,460
Probably everyone can relate to this, don't
you think?

17
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:27,020
I was thinking back then, when I was so enthusiastic
about comics, it would be so cool to make

18
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:29,869
comic art myself.

19
00:01:29,869 --> 00:01:35,700
Things turned out differently - I'm working
as a software engineer, build web applications

20
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:39,210
and other things, but I like to draw in my
free time.

21
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:46,509
I thought maybe I could make it a hobby or
activity that I just pursue in my after-hours

22
00:01:46,509 --> 00:01:49,439
after work, and I actually maybe create something?

23
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:51,900
So I had a look at what my options were.

24
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:56,920
I remember from back in the time that print
comics like the traditional medium of comics

25
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:04,689
as we already know it for centuries, in fact,
is something that might be worth pursuing.

26
00:02:04,689 --> 00:02:08,209
And I looked at what the challenges were that
I had to overcome to do this.

27
00:02:08,209 --> 00:02:14,680
I realised that there were a couple of them
that came into my realm as a comic artist.

28
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:18,560
First of all, I would have to find a way to
publish myself, or maybe find a publisher.

29
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:24,140
I couldn't get ... to get my work out, which
seemed like a laborious process.

30
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:29,590
Then I also realised that, when I actually
wanted to make people aware of where my comic

31
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:35,170
is and what it does, I had to focus on print-based
marketing.

32
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:43,110
Maybe I go to a fair, or tell me in person
what this comic is about.

33
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:49,540
Last but not least, also I would have to go
to this month or a year-long thing where I

34
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:54,290
actually draw everything, hand it into my
publisher, and they edit, and they correct

35
00:02:54,290 --> 00:03:00,810
it, and send it back, I have to reedit it,
until I actually publish my first comic.

36
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:05,189
And this already seems like a bitch, but then
I looked on the other side, how does it look

37
00:03:05,189 --> 00:03:08,910
for challenge-wise for people who want to
read my comic later on?

38
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:14,989
How do readers of my comic interact with this
and what do they have to overcome?

39
00:03:14,989 --> 00:03:18,870
I realised that first of all they have to
have physical access to the medium, so they

40
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:23,189
have to go down to the book store, or at least
they have to go to the door when the mail

41
00:03:23,189 --> 00:03:27,659
order arrives, or pick up the package at the
Post Office.

42
00:03:27,659 --> 00:03:30,690
They also have to carry around the book and
actually bring it with them.

43
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:34,099
They can't even go out with a whole library
of comics.

44
00:03:34,099 --> 00:03:40,290
They maybe take a book or two, and this is
about it because of portability concerns.

45
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:44,489
But something that really struck me when I
thought about it a little bit longer was something

46
00:03:44,489 --> 00:03:49,400
much more significant, and, in fact, I kind
of like didn't really consider that there

47
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:55,890
is this very kind of essential prerequisite
that I have to fulfil when I actually read

48
00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:57,530
a printed comic.

49
00:03:57,530 --> 00:04:04,810
That is it actually requires me to have almost
perfect vision.

50
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:13,109
I actually am required to be a sighted person
to read a comic book from, I don't know, everything

51
00:04:13,109 --> 00:04:18,220
funny - or my Mickey Mouse magazine.

52
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:20,810
This is something I found really odd to think
about.

53
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:23,310
I was, "I didn't even consider this."

54
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:26,640
Because I looked like a sighted person all
my life.

55
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:29,610
I never even bothered to think about it.

56
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:34,740
Then, after this, I was okay, but, actually,
are there options?

57
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:36,669
Like how do you actually read comics when
you're blind?

58
00:04:36,669 --> 00:04:39,680
Or a visually impaired person?

59
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:44,610
I looked on the internet and I found a lot
of interesting ideas of people who are already

60
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:49,100
putting into practice what I couldn't imagine
even until this point.

61
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:54,410
People who actually tried to expand out of
the visual realm of comics to other fields

62
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:55,490
of senses.

63
00:04:55,490 --> 00:05:03,120
One project, for example, I found interesting
was some that tried to explore haptic senses

64
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:09,682
and audio senses, so people who might have
never had the ability to actually read comics

65
00:05:09,682 --> 00:05:15,130
but also those who might have lost their vision
during their life could go back and read their

66
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:18,240
favourite stories again as they used to.

67
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:25,069
One of these projects, for example, is called
Live, by Philip Meyer, and he creates a Braille-like

68
00:05:25,069 --> 00:05:34,710
comic book which shows the stories in a haptic
manner.

69
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:43,610
You can touch the material in front of you
to understand what is going on, and to understand

70
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:46,410
where locally and spatially protagonists are
currently in.

71
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:54,860
This is an interesting web comic written by
Christopher Wright who makes an intentional

72
00:05:54,860 --> 00:06:00,849
effort not only to upload every single image
of his strips on to his personal website,

73
00:06:00,849 --> 00:06:07,250
but also includes right next to it a comic
transcript that can be read by screenreader

74
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:10,349
users once they browse the website.

75
00:06:10,349 --> 00:06:17,370
I think the most inspiring project in my opinion
has been Comics and Power which is a comic

76
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:25,699
book store created for the blind which features
several very popular comic books very well

77
00:06:25,699 --> 00:06:30,759
that are narrated by a - generated by a single
person in a fashion that creates this illusion

78
00:06:30,759 --> 00:06:36,539
that you actually reading the comic, you're
putting up the comic book reading from panel

79
00:06:36,539 --> 00:06:45,250
to panel the text, but also the sound-like
descriptions of any kind of noises.

80
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:46,889
And I found this really cool.

81
00:06:46,889 --> 00:06:51,400
Looking at this, and actually trying to find
out more about the guy who actually did this

82
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:58,479
to create this very immersive experience using
audio-generated comics, I wanted to try something

83
00:06:58,479 --> 00:06:59,639
similar myself.

84
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:03,930
I wanted to dive deeper into what can you
do with audio?

85
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:11,340
How can you tap the potential of audio-narrated
stories and how can you make use of this quite

86
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:12,650
easily on the web?

87
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:19,009
I knew that screenreaders were a quite straightforward
approach because I knew so many web pages

88
00:07:19,009 --> 00:07:23,889
could be read by screenreaders if it was done
right.

89
00:07:23,889 --> 00:07:26,009
So I started out.

90
00:07:26,009 --> 00:07:31,490
In my day-to-day work, I actually work at
a consulting firm that also specialises in

91
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:38,690
helping clients with Ruby and Amber, and this
would be familiar for me, I was thinking it

92
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:43,120
would be cool if it was like a JavaScript
application with the Amber text stack because

93
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,030
this is familiar.

94
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:50,901
Also, it actually helps me later on because
it's already a fully fledged single-page application

95
00:07:50,901 --> 00:07:57,409
framework to scale my application easily with
co-released and co-maintained dependencies,

96
00:07:57,409 --> 00:08:03,591
like data library, a testing solution, or
also routed solution out of the box to make

97
00:08:03,591 --> 00:08:07,699
it easier for me.

98
00:08:07,699 --> 00:08:13,080
I would know that two years and three years
from now, this app exists, and it should also

99
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,620
work and be maintainable.

100
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:20,930
Last but not least, I also thought it would
be so cool if it was like a proper JavaScript

101
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:26,650
application because then I can actually with
all of this interactivity, interesting animations

102
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:33,169
for a sighted user experience that might also
be very immersive and interesting to explore.

103
00:08:33,169 --> 00:08:41,080
So, looking at the approach that comics Comics
of Power provided, I wanted to have a similar

104
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:47,140
user story for screenreader users for those
who use assistive technologies to browse the

105
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:48,180
web comic.

106
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:51,240
I wanted to write an embedded transcript.

107
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:55,430
I couldn't think about having the transcript
right next to the page.

108
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:59,850
I actually wanted to have the experience that
would be similar to someone coming to the

109
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:02,440
website and reading panel for panel.

110
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:09,140
I also wanted to include annotation for imagery,
not only to translate text, so people actually

111
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:14,940
can get, like, image of the scene, and last
but not least, yes, I actually wanted to create

112
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:20,010
this illusion that there is this inner voice
that you have when you have read something,

113
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:23,040
and that is what it actually reading to you.

114
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:27,960
I think it would be really cool to have it
all generated to have proper voice acting,

115
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:33,740
but for this first version of this application,
I really wanted just to have an approach to

116
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:38,600
make it as easily and accessible as possible,
and a screenreader approach seemed perfect

117
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:41,510
for me.

118
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:48,990
This storytelling that a is screenreader-driven
I realised was straightforward to implement

119
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:55,339
once I took advantage of HTML and the powers
of area.

120
00:09:55,339 --> 00:09:59,240
In my application, for example, I have these
single frames that you can see here on the

121
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,260
left side.

122
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:03,720
Here, for example, be you can see like a person
on a boat.

123
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:08,079
They're, like, on the sea, and you can also
see is a speech bubble saying "no" and just

124
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:11,970
like a sound word saying "splash".

125
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:19,570
Each of these images can be contained in several
layers of images, so I can have an a background

126
00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:25,350
image, a foreground image, and all kinds of
other text bubbles as well that I embedded

127
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:32,900
in the single frame, and I knew that to actually
make the whole scene be narrated as I would

128
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:38,339
see it as the reader, I wanted to have one
single description of it.

129
00:10:38,339 --> 00:10:44,770
I wanted to have one single tag, or one single
labour for the screenreader to actually read.

130
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:52,519
I decided to make use of art attributes, or
area labels, and this case, and, more specifically

131
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:58,150
in this case, with the area label, and the
image roll, in my application to actually

132
00:10:58,150 --> 00:11:04,190
make sure that everything that is told in
this image, it's also available for the screenreader

133
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:05,190
users.

134
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:11,160
There is also a word of caution, though: you
can use area labels when you want, if it is

135
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:18,029
necessary, if you realise that it really eases
your development effort, but using area all

136
00:11:18,029 --> 00:11:24,940
over your place in your application, over
the use of using semantic HTML can also be

137
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:33,209
hard for screenreaders to actually read, and
therefore they should only be used sparingly.

138
00:11:33,209 --> 00:11:38,709
What you can also do if you know you have
one single image, just use the alt attribute

139
00:11:38,709 --> 00:11:43,600
of the image tag, and then you actually are
on the best way to actually implement this,

140
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:48,170
because browsers are actually built in a way
to support this straightforwardly with very

141
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:50,810
good support.

142
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:56,850
And 1&1 interesting thing I found with building
this web comic is realising how powerful it

143
00:11:56,850 --> 00:12:04,600
is to embed not only an image but HTML, but
once I do so, it becomes the screenreaders,

144
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:07,740
and it's available just by default.

145
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:18,529
Don't have to do anything but it's already
there in my narrative.

146
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:25,360
I will show you how I like to test this later
on in my application to see what is actually

147
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,360
happening.

148
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:29,070
I like to use this specific screenreader called
Chrome Box.

149
00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:36,920
It's like a free screenreader plugin you can
plug in Chrome, and in Mac Voiceover, and

150
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:45,329
Windows user - it's a popular screenreader
in the blind community.

151
00:12:45,329 --> 00:12:51,120
I think any screenreader you get started with
is great for accessibility testing.

152
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,490
Let's see how it goes.

153
00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:57,269
So, this is still a little bit quiet, I think.

154
00:12:57,269 --> 00:13:00,800
Maybe let's try just how it goes.

155
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,560
Can you already hear something?

156
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:05,019
Here on the stage, it's a bit hard to tell.

157
00:13:05,019 --> 00:13:07,709
Now we're we're on the website.

158
00:13:07,709 --> 00:13:10,459
I have this frame embedded.

159
00:13:10,459 --> 00:13:20,540
"Click here to maintain ...". With the screenreader,
it can navigate the page and skip from each

160
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:28,540
interactive element to the next interactive
element on the page.

161
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:32,500
Also, yes, described by the screenreader,
and, most importantly, each single frame can

162
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:36,090
actually be interacted with as well, and it
can actually be read.

163
00:13:36,090 --> 00:13:40,269
"There is a person in a thick jacket sitting
on the boat in a dark and stormy sea."

164
00:13:40,269 --> 00:13:41,269
Image.

165
00:13:41,269 --> 00:13:48,079
I'm not a recognised book author yet, but
I'm getting there.

166
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:52,269
"The boat is rocking apply while the waves
splash against it.

167
00:13:52,269 --> 00:13:55,320
Image "Swoosh.

168
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:58,370
Splash."

169
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:01,420
[Applause].

170
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:04,290
The person in the boat is sitting on it motionless.

171
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:05,290
Image.."

172
00:14:05,290 --> 00:14:10,460
every element can be read to you by the screenreader.

173
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:14,430
Also, the text bubbles that might accrue.

174
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:19,519
"Their face still unrecognisable in the darkened
half hood of the cover of their jacket.

175
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:20,519
Which way?"

176
00:14:20,519 --> 00:14:22,360
I found this impressive.

177
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:24,880
This comes out of the box.

178
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,889
Yes, I don't have to do too much effort.

179
00:14:27,889 --> 00:14:31,930
HTML is already on my side.

180
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:37,180
This is is really great.

181
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:44,660
Let's just like it in.

182
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:46,480
[Applause].

183
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:50,120
Thank you.

184
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:54,880
Something I find super striking every time
I go on to Reddit or see demonstrations of

185
00:14:54,880 --> 00:15:03,240
blind users showing how they interact with
the web is that the zoom feature is so - yes,

186
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:07,830
so obligatory for an experience on the web
for them.

187
00:15:07,830 --> 00:15:12,339
Being able to not only on your desktop but
also on your hand held device, to go in and

188
00:15:12,339 --> 00:15:15,950
tap in and zoom in with your two fingers is
essential.

189
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:22,699
What you might have seen in some of the applications
that you've wrote, yes, I'm guilty of this

190
00:15:22,699 --> 00:15:25,200
myself, is something like that.

191
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:29,649
So this actually sets the maximum scale of
the whole screen to one, meaning you cannot

192
00:15:29,649 --> 00:15:35,300
zoom any more, and this is something I sometimes
implement because there a user request that

193
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:39,360
every time I tap into an input field, suddenly,
the whole page zooms and I can't do anything

194
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,360
any more.

195
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:42,810
You add this, and the issue is fixed.

196
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:48,870
It also introduces a major bug for anyone
who has a visual impairment and can barely

197
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:54,709
see what is on the screen, so things are too
small, or the images are a little bit too

198
00:15:54,709 --> 00:15:56,300
blurry, had too low contrast.

199
00:15:56,300 --> 00:16:01,810
What is so essential for preserving this capability
is being able to zoom and not provide the

200
00:16:01,810 --> 00:16:02,899
maximum scale.

201
00:16:02,899 --> 00:16:09,269
I find it important to note out to actually
pay attention to making this possible.

202
00:16:09,269 --> 00:16:11,769
Font sizes should be legible.

203
00:16:11,769 --> 00:16:16,420
Use 60 pixel or larger and you're good to
go.

204
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:24,040
Having a rich contrast, having like favourably
dark colour on a light background is also

205
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:31,100
preliminary for a great user experience for
anyone who is visually impaired.

206
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:35,630
In my comic book, I was thinking it would
be cool to have fancy animations.

207
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:43,380
I wanted nice eye candy for anyone who is
sighted and wanted to enjoy the experience.

208
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:48,839
So, I was thinking, okay, like anything I
have to take care of.

209
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:55,700
And in this instance, I actually remembered
one very specific incident called the Pokémon

210
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:58,019
shock incident.

211
00:16:58,019 --> 00:17:04,500
This actually occurred, maybe some of you
too young to still know this, but it's happened

212
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:11,740
around, like, 20 years ago in 1997 in December
in Japan, where suddenly, at like a certain

213
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:19,581
time of December 17th, almost 700 children
were admitted to the local hospitals, and

214
00:17:19,581 --> 00:17:20,581
everyone was surprised.

215
00:17:20,581 --> 00:17:21,820
It is, "What was going on?"

216
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:24,510
It was happening all over the country.

217
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:34,030
The kids had symptoms like nausea, dizziness,
some even had seizures.

218
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:40,190
Later on, it actually occurred to everyone
that just recently, a new episode of Pokémon

219
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:41,210
has been aired on TV.

220
00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:43,780
It seemed there was a correlation.

221
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:45,970
The episode got taken down.

222
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:50,970
The agency broadcasting the episode went on
an investigation to find out what is going

223
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:51,970
on.

224
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:57,330
They actually came to the view that this one
specific scene might have been the cause of

225
00:17:57,330 --> 00:18:02,810
this very adverse effects in so many children
all over the country who watched the episode.

226
00:18:02,810 --> 00:18:08,540
So, in the episode, I won't show the scene,
obviously, because it's not safe, but in the

227
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:14,440
episode, there's one particular scene where
you can see two different specific frames.

228
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:17,680
I'm showing the frames, which is totally fine.

229
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:24,290
First of all, the creators of the episode
showed a very bright red frame right next

230
00:18:24,290 --> 00:18:30,730
to a very bright blue frame in high frequency
interchangeably for around six seconds.

231
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:38,010
So, this created a very strobe-like effect,
and in people who have photo sensitive epilepsy

232
00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:44,850
or those who are prone to seizures caused
by strobe-like effects, this can have adverse

233
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:51,710
health effects, and this is something that
really taught me that it's so important to

234
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:57,790
also watch out for this, and, in regards to
strobe effects, I also realised that so many

235
00:18:57,790 --> 00:19:03,390
people are actually out there who don't even
know they have the condition because they're

236
00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:06,360
ever exposed to any kind of lighting like
that.

237
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:10,810
The only safe measure that you can take for
making sure that no-one gets harmed is not

238
00:19:10,810 --> 00:19:16,190
to use any of these kinds of strobe-light
effects at all.

239
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:19,820
This is when I realised that this is what
I wanted to take care of, and, last but not

240
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:26,660
least, make sure that animations are not autoplay
by default but can also be set this way.

241
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:35,330
There are many other things that I as a developer
can actually reassess before I can say, this

242
00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:37,500
web application is really now accessible.

243
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:42,440
It's key part of accessibility to actually
make place for screenreaders or users who

244
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:47,710
own interact with the keyboard to go through
the application, but colour contrast, semantic

245
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:56,401
HTML, are so critical - correct heading RHD
to allow people who are not sighted to navigate

246
00:19:56,401 --> 00:20:02,670
the page and actually explore it in a very
natural way, and also landmarks are one of

247
00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:05,560
these things.

248
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:10,300
One other aspect I want to go into to is page
navigation route changes.

249
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:14,500
Many of us are building these single-page
applications or JavaScript applications that

250
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:20,630
have their very custom routing solution where
a lot of things we don't get out of the box

251
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:26,030
that we might have had with a server-rendered
app, and, in my application, this was also

252
00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:27,030
the case.

253
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:32,420
If, like a user, for example, just navigated
to another page, for example, to a new chapter,

254
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:35,220
they wouldn't get any feedback on the screenreader.

255
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:40,030
Instead, they might further explore with a
screenreader what is going on in the page

256
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:46,750
but go like, "I think I changed the page,"
but not really sure what actually happened.

257
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:52,900
I actually found that, in the ecosystem that
I work in, there is an add-on, like a plugin

258
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:59,300
that I can snore in my application called
document title that helps me update the document

259
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:02,830
title of an application every time the route
changes.

260
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:08,530
This is a pre-requirement for the other solution
I wanted to also have in my application which

261
00:21:08,530 --> 00:21:13,770
is called "accessibility announcer" which
is a simple component I can drop into my route

262
00:21:13,770 --> 00:21:19,830
application template, and this will then keep
track of changes of the document title, will

263
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:25,330
observe this, and every time it does change,
it will make sure that screenreaders pick

264
00:21:25,330 --> 00:21:30,400
up on the change, and can actually feed that
back to the user.

265
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:37,760
This is now Amber-specific, but I'm very confident
that, in whatever ecosystem you are building

266
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:41,540
an application - or be it like a vanilla JavaScript
application, there's already a straightforward

267
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:47,230
community solution for you there that you
can also as easily install, and if there is

268
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:53,350
not, I can also highly encourage you to start
building one and maybe ask the comment that

269
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:56,440
you're building in it for help.

270
00:21:56,440 --> 00:22:02,750
Interestingly, just like getting into the
details of how to make that app accessible,

271
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:09,040
I also want to learn more about how in general
we actually make apps accessible.

272
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:14,000
In her very informative talk called Don't
Break the Web Melanie Sumner goes into detail

273
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:23,220
how the app is not accessible to some audiences
and what we can do to make it better.

274
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:28,510
I think the most striking number, or the most
striking summary I took away from the talk

275
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:30,880
are the following numbers.

276
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:37,810
There's been this kind of survey like this
investigation of the web AEM who actually

277
00:22:37,810 --> 00:22:43,120
explored the accessibility of one million
home pages, and, more specifically, of the

278
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:48,480
one million most popular websites and their
home pages, thinking that it is the very first

279
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,480
page anyone sees.

280
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:53,420
It's probably the page where you put most
effort into that everyone can actually exit

281
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:58,970
from and further navigate from it, and looking
at the popular ones to have an estimate of,

282
00:22:58,970 --> 00:23:04,390
okay, this is like how people usually experience
the web, because these are the most popular

283
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:06,520
websites everyone visits.

284
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:10,870
If you now look at this pie chart, you can
see there is this one number, which is a large

285
00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:16,160
97.89 per cent and the other one is around
two per cent.

286
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:20,110
And looking at accessibility, the one to I
understood - they want to find out, like,

287
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:23,410
how many of these web pages are actually functional?

288
00:23:23,410 --> 00:23:27,230
Don't have any accessibility errors?

289
00:23:27,230 --> 00:23:30,750
It would be so great if you could say, most
of them actually are accessible.

290
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:35,540
Most are functional, like the most popular
websites, probably put so much effort into

291
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:40,300
making it functionable for screenreaders and
other kinds of assistive technology, but the

292
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:46,840
truth today still is that these two 2.2 per
cent that we saw on the chart are the ones

293
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:53,870
that actually work according to the accessibility
guidelines, and the other striking amount

294
00:23:53,870 --> 00:23:57,600
of 98 per cent of sites accessibility-wise
are broken.

295
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:00,010
What does it mean broken?

296
00:24:00,010 --> 00:24:06,360
Mostly, a colour-contrast issue, so someone
who is visually impaired can't read the text

297
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:10,620
properly or explore the elements on the first
page of the website.

298
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:15,270
It has a lot to do with images that actually
are informative but don't have an alt attribute

299
00:24:15,270 --> 00:24:21,890
next to it, and also broken links, or empty
link tags that, for example, have opened up

300
00:24:21,890 --> 00:24:24,850
a model but actually don't lead Anne anywhere.

301
00:24:24,850 --> 00:24:29,330
As a screenreader user, you might want to
navigate to a link like that but once you

302
00:24:29,330 --> 00:24:33,410
hit it, you realise I'm not sure, not getting
back from the screenreader.

303
00:24:33,410 --> 00:24:38,430
So what is going on?

304
00:24:38,430 --> 00:24:45,750
And honestly, it's some kind of work, and
we have to do something to actually improve

305
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:47,150
the situation.

306
00:24:47,150 --> 00:24:55,280
There are things like we can install in our
test suite to make it possible to actually

307
00:24:55,280 --> 00:25:02,180
automate the process of testing our applications
for accessibility, but also other tools can

308
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:06,810
help us to get a better feeling for it.

309
00:25:06,810 --> 00:25:11,730
But most importantly, I think, we actually
have to practise empathy and get a better

310
00:25:11,730 --> 00:25:17,380
understanding about what the experience for
other people who are not as sighted as us,

311
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:22,270
or not as, like, motor-skilled as us, actually
experience the web.

312
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:26,420
Therefore, I would like to encourage you to
actually get a screenreader running, and actually

313
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:30,240
do a real manual accessibility testing, because
this is how I see it.

314
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:36,210
Like, if you had had like a CSS-style bark
on your website, saying this is happening

315
00:25:36,210 --> 00:25:38,390
in Firefox, you would say, wow.

316
00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:41,200
I'm going to reproduce it this Firefox.

317
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:47,210
I'm going to check manually in Firefox as
well if it actually works to make sure that

318
00:25:47,210 --> 00:25:49,700
it is functional again.

319
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:53,420
I think a similar thing might apply to accessibility
testing.

320
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:58,680
Getting a screenreader, reproducing what the
page actually does, and then, most importantly,

321
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:03,150
if you're a sighted programmer, unplug your
screen.

322
00:26:03,150 --> 00:26:10,180
See what is happening, how you can actually
experience websites, see if elements are missing

323
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:12,380
or gone or you can't find them any more.

324
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:19,750
See if you're confused about the content they
want to explore is, and then figure out what

325
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:23,160
can it actually do to improve the situation?

326
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:30,410
In the end, I believe it's really about trying
to create great things on the web, and this

327
00:26:30,410 --> 00:26:36,030
doesn't only include comics, this doesn't
only include art, this includes so many other

328
00:26:36,030 --> 00:26:40,220
great things that you already build on the
web, and I believe it would be such a great

329
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:44,520
promise in the future if you can make it accessible
to literally everyone.

330
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:46,770
With that said, thank you so much.

331
00:26:46,770 --> 00:26:53,670
I would also give a special thank you to Guy
from Comics of Power who helped me with reviewing

332
00:26:53,670 --> 00:26:59,020
my web application just for free, which is
great, and all these great other inspiring

333
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:03,190
people who speak on accessibility.

334
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:05,990
If you're interested in the topic, follow
any of them.

335
00:27:05,990 --> 00:27:08,460
I can assure you, you will learn so much.

336
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:09,870
With that again, thank you so much.
