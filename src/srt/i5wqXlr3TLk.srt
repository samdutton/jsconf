hi okay this is working great welcome to

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,030
my presentation about accessible

3
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:11,880
customizable select my name is Martin

4
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:13,440
your cha or you can call me macho

5
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:16,500
whichever you like and I work as a

6
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:19,199
front-end developer for the system that

7
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:22,800
sees at a Czech company now let me

8
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,160
address the elephant in the room why

9
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,830
another JavaScript select after all

10
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:31,040
isn't it the first rule of Eric's

11
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:33,120
accessibility that we should always use

12
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,719
the native select whenever possible true

13
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:39,329
however the native thought is very hard

14
00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:42,390
to style using CSS this forces us to

15
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:44,340
create our own custom implementations

16
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:46,829
and we need to re-implement the

17
00:00:46,829 --> 00:00:50,070
accessibility into it as well and I'm

18
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:51,870
not talking just about high enough

19
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:54,600
contrast and large enough funds what I

20
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,960
mean is supporting properly assistive

21
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:00,059
technologies such as the screen readers

22
00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:04,199
used by visually impaired and since this

23
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:06,450
is obviously a hard problem there must

24
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:08,729
be plenty of existing solutions that are

25
00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:13,130
out there well I have looked into them I

26
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:16,320
have reviewed and tested various

27
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:19,110
existing solutions provided by various

28
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:21,869
companies also various techniques that

29
00:01:21,869 --> 00:01:23,280
are recommended to anyone needs to

30
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,159
implement their own select element

31
00:01:25,159 --> 00:01:28,710
unfortunately there were some issues for

32
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:31,020
example the implementation provided by

33
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:33,420
Google as part of the polymer project is

34
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:36,960
not compatible with jaws and this quirky

35
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,150
when used with voice-over screen readers

36
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:42,200
so how can we use such a solution

37
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:45,930
we cannot on the other hand there's

38
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:48,990
implementation by jQuery UI which is

39
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:52,680
buggy with plenty of screen readers and

40
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:55,590
remains completely silent when used with

41
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:57,659
voiceover so how can we use such a

42
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:02,399
solution we cannot to make things worse

43
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:04,530
we were actually looking for a solution

44
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:06,270
that could be integrated into any

45
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:08,489
project regardless of its front-end

46
00:02:08,489 --> 00:02:12,180
technology but of course accessibility

47
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:13,310
was the top

48
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:17,000
one priority and what do I mean we were

49
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,319
looking for a solution that works

50
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:20,450
regardless of the operating system the

51
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:23,989
user may be using with slide reservation

52
00:02:23,989 --> 00:02:26,930
so when it comes to Linux since it's a

53
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:29,000
port for assistive technologies it's not

54
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,390
as great as it could be next we of

55
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:34,400
course must support all the common

56
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,130
commonly used browsers including

57
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:40,400
Internet Explorer 11 though it is

58
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,230
favorable if the technologies used by

59
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:44,540
the solution would be poly fillable for

60
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:49,040
up to i8 as hinted before support for

61
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,650
all major screen readers are used around

62
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:54,769
the world is a must and of course we

63
00:02:54,769 --> 00:02:56,959
cannot you cannot forget about the

64
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:59,510
myriad of keyboard shortcuts that are

65
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:02,500
supported by the native select element

66
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:05,630
don't worry we don't have to consider

67
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:07,849
all of these combinations of all these

68
00:03:07,849 --> 00:03:10,099
technologies equally since there are

69
00:03:10,099 --> 00:03:12,380
some combinations that are recommended

70
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:14,870
by the providers and vendors of these

71
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:17,540
assistive technologies it doesn't mean

72
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:20,390
we can ignore the rest we just need to

73
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:23,930
make sure that these work really well on

74
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:25,280
the other hand there are some

75
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,200
combinations that are just not

76
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,900
compatible at all for example the jaws

77
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:33,350
screen reader is incompatible with the

78
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:35,690
edge browser I'm told this is being

79
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:39,890
fixed anyway all of this has took us on

80
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:43,250
a several months of a journey in which

81
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:46,010
we were testing and prototyping and we

82
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:48,170
made quite a couple of findings for

83
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:50,660
example the accessibility support in

84
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:53,079
browsers could still be improved and

85
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:55,880
support for Aria which is used to make

86
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:59,090
our websites more accessible and is

87
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:00,560
implemented by the assistive

88
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,500
technologies not the browser's is

89
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,859
implemented inconsistently

90
00:04:05,859 --> 00:04:08,720
this leads to situations where you are

91
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,600
prototyping and testing a solution it

92
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:14,450
seems to work fine in one which one

93
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:16,100
assistive technology then you start

94
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:18,079
testing it with another and things

95
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:20,600
completely break apart after a moment

96
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,580
you'll begin to feel like Alice in the

97
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:25,570
Wonderland things just don't make

98
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:33,790
since this is me right here anyway there

99
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:36,370
are some positive sites about this for

100
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:38,620
example once you put accessibility into

101
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:41,860
the mix the Android and iOS platform are

102
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:44,080
pretty much the same this simplifies

103
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:47,140
things throughout all of this I've been

104
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:50,440
reminded of a quote by Steve Jobs yes

105
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:53,440
he's had more handsome than me great

106
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,470
things are never done by one person in

107
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:58,360
business they are done by a team of

108
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:01,540
people similarly to achieve great

109
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:04,150
accessibility we cannot rely on just a

110
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:06,190
single technique we will need to find a

111
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:07,900
combination of techniques that will work

112
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:11,620
well together well have we find found

113
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:17,500
such a solution I'm happy to tell you

114
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:20,500
that indeed we have a we were able to

115
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:23,260
design a solution that adapts and works

116
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:26,320
very well with all the compatible

117
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,360
combinations of these major technologies

118
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:31,890
the project itself is MIT licensed

119
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:35,140
open-source available at github where

120
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:37,030
you will find a more detailed project

121
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:40,000
information a current documentation and

122
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,550
how you may integrate this into any of

123
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:44,530
your projects regardless of the

124
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:46,960
technology you may be using thank you

125
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,640
and I wish you and I stay here in

126
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:52,870
