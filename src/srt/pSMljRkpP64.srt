1
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:11,870

yeah hello everybody didn't expect that

2
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:13,790
many people to my first days unconscious

3
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:15,679
talk

4
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:20,060
over here yeah hacking games and why

5
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:21,759
should you do it

6
00:00:21,759 --> 00:00:24,560
most of us started learning programming

7
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:28,039
by ourselves at home reading books or

8
00:00:28,039 --> 00:00:29,960
magazines and then the internet came and

9
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:32,660
we learned everything there and but I

10
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:34,400
think we can agree on that we actually

11
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:36,080
learn the most while we are debugging

12
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:38,480
and searching from box and browsing the

13
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,339
code and really try to understand what

14
00:00:40,339 --> 00:00:42,470
we actually did there because while

15
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:44,030
we're coding we kind of know what we're

16
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:45,620
doing and we just type it down in the

17
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:47,089
end everything works we're happy and

18
00:00:47,089 --> 00:00:51,470
never see the file again and yeah and I

19
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:54,320
also really like games and what I do in

20
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,780
my free time is except fun apart from

21
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:59,600
programming games I check out games

22
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,330
online and try to see their code and how

23
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:04,220
they solve the problems they had and how

24
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:07,030
I can manipulate that to my advantage so

25
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:10,640
what do you see here this is a game I

26
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,350
actually made myself kind of a

27
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:15,560
proof-of-concept thing I made this back

28
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:19,280
when this candy box thing went why were

29
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,470
probably you know that game where you

30
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:23,180
get candy and you can eat all the candy

31
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:24,320
and then you get a sword and you get

32
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,270
quests and the Frog comes and you can

33
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:28,970
answer all the questions and so what do

34
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:30,320
you have to do here it's a very simple

35
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,510
game the goal is to become a millionaire

36
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:34,700
and you have 20 gold and you can mine

37
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:37,940
gold so it's a classic clicker game and

38
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:39,380
it's also an idol game because you can

39
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:42,560
use your goal gold to buy a miner

40
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,540
so here's Pete he's just working in the

41
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:47,960
mind and every 5 gold or so he puts his

42
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:50,900
gold into my pocket and he's working and

43
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:52,729
he has an efficiency and I can use my

44
00:01:52,729 --> 00:01:54,710
goal to upgrade Pete or I can use my

45
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:55,070
gold

46
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:57,590
- hi another miner so if I don't want to

47
00:01:57,590 --> 00:02:00,020
wait and so Peter is has mined all the

48
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:02,720
gold I just click here very rapidly and

49
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:05,570
now I buy a second miner and click again

50
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:07,460
again ok that's a hundred that takes too

51
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:09,530
much time now I'm already bored and I

52
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:12,140
want the game to progress faster so what

53
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:12,530
do I do

54
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:16,010
first thing is I check the sources so

55
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:18,290
there's a JavaScript folder and there's

56
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:21,260
an index.html that's the easiest way to

57
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:24,079
start just go there and check for any

58
00:02:24,079 --> 00:02:26,569
scripts so there's one script check

59
00:02:26,569 --> 00:02:28,540
loading required yes

60
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:30,939
and data - loading the edges so I might

61
00:02:30,939 --> 00:02:40,120
want to check out the fjs not to game.js

62
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:46,030
where's the FJ jeaious asd there's no HS

63
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:49,150
so maybe it's the game J's maybe I don't

64
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:51,549
know my code as well so I checked the

65
00:02:51,549 --> 00:02:53,709
code in a browser code and I can set

66
00:02:53,709 --> 00:02:55,629
some breakpoints of course that would be

67
00:02:55,629 --> 00:02:59,650
the easiest approach or I can check if

68
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:01,900
there's something like access to the

69
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:03,400
window object when a game object to

70
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:06,450
store this is obviously on purpose yeah

71
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:08,799
but the much more easier approaches I

72
00:03:08,799 --> 00:03:10,239
know I can click this button to get some

73
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:13,209
gold so why don't I just inspect it and

74
00:03:13,209 --> 00:03:15,190
see if it has an ID or it has an ID and

75
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:18,879
just take that and hopefully jQuery is

76
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:22,720
installed and looks like it is I have to

77
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,819
code with one hand now that's a little

78
00:03:24,819 --> 00:03:28,599
bit difficult like that okay I get it

79
00:03:28,599 --> 00:03:33,430
and I can run the click function did it

80
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:33,970
work

81
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:36,480
and it looks like it works okay now the

82
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:41,889
tricky stuff set interval and then I

83
00:03:41,889 --> 00:03:45,780
pass in a function and then I take the

84
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:50,410
button like that and and I do click and

85
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:52,480
because I don't want to wait that long

86
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:59,440
ah there's the syntax error I just don't

87
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,389
pass any value into the set interval

88
00:04:01,389 --> 00:04:03,220
function with Mason on really fast and

89
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:04,959
now I get all the goals I want and I can

90
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:08,799
buy all the - I need and now I just have

91
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:13,180
to wait okay I actually came depending

92
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:14,889
on my memory on my local machine I can

93
00:04:14,889 --> 00:04:18,600
run this couple times more

94
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,940
and those increases Madchester and now

95
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:22,980
apparently I got all the minor so now I

96
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:24,660
can work on the efficiency so they are

97
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:27,600
better at mining but still now we would

98
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,850
wait like ten minutes to get all them 1

99
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:31,890
million and actually tested it when you

100
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:33,660
only have the - and you don't cheat and

101
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:35,370
you have all the - and no efficiency

102
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:38,310
upgrade it takes like 24 hours for them

103
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:40,050
to mine all the 1 million but that's

104
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:43,800
obviously too much time so what can we

105
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,290
do we know we have to become a

106
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:46,740
millionaire

107
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:49,560
and we already check the source and so

108
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,330
that oh there's the PETA object in the

109
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:53,990
window so you might want to inspect that

110
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:56,910
Pete so it looks like a backbone view

111
00:04:56,910 --> 00:04:59,970
because it obviously is and what do I

112
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:01,620
have you have an event lock I don't care

113
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:03,300
for that I have improvements or whatever

114
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:04,890
I never saw that actually that's a

115
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:06,870
feature I put in and then put it out

116
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:09,840
again so we don't care for that I have

117
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,240
miners which is an area where all my -

118
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,620
restored but I don't care for them

119
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:15,720
because they're too slow and their stats

120
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:18,810
Oh instead looks very nice so I have a

121
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:20,910
back size probably the size of the

122
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:22,830
miners and when they put their gold into

123
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:25,200
my storage don't care much for that and

124
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,870
I have the state of my current gold this

125
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:30,810
is very nice so let me quickly reload

126
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:33,600
that to make it more obvious what

127
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,390
happens now I can use Pete and then

128
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:39,540
stats this is the third subject I could

129
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:41,070
easily try to say oh there's a one

130
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:44,700
property I put it to true and what

131
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:45,390
happens next

132
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:47,460
hmm seems like nothing happened except

133
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:49,890
that I can't really do anything

134
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:52,320
so probably the games check that I win

135
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:55,320
that didn't make a proper response what

136
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,900
else can I do

137
00:05:56,900 --> 00:06:01,520
there's gold ah that sounds nice so Pete

138
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:05,580
dot stats dot gold equals nine nine nine

139
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:09,450
nine nine zero okay that worked

140
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:12,480
obviously and now I try to click it for

141
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,310
ten times I have the patience for that

142
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:17,940
actually nice I won the game very good I

143
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:19,200
don't have to play it anymore I know all

144
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,000
the features but that's something I

145
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,410
programmed myself that was pretty easy

146
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:26,700
to hack now try a real example I already

147
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:30,690
talked about candy box there's when you

148
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:32,490
first load the page you only see

149
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:34,590
and is increasing over time and suddenly

150
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:35,849
there appears a baton where I can eat

151
00:06:35,849 --> 00:06:38,009
all the candy and nothing happened

152
00:06:38,009 --> 00:06:40,139
except for a text that I ate nine

153
00:06:40,139 --> 00:06:43,470
candies and on my first try of this game

154
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:45,330
I just clicked it over and over again in

155
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:46,770
the hope that something would change but

156
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:48,990
actually nothing changed you have to

157
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:50,039
wait until they're like a hundred

158
00:06:50,039 --> 00:06:52,789
candies and the next button appears and

159
00:06:52,789 --> 00:06:55,259
the game kinda explode from there you

160
00:06:55,259 --> 00:06:56,970
get more and more features or I can

161
00:06:56,970 --> 00:06:59,910
throw pennies on the ground I can do

162
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:01,919
that much more often and sometimes there

163
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:04,650
will be a unhappy smiley face there and

164
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:07,020
it changes depending on how many candy

165
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:08,340
you can throw on the ground you throw on

166
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:10,919
the ground so but I don't want to wait

167
00:07:10,919 --> 00:07:13,050
here and I want to improve that as well

168
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:15,449
so I check the sources again and see

169
00:07:15,449 --> 00:07:18,240
there's a scripts folder and there's

170
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:22,440
lots of streets so many scripts so when

171
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,449
I come to a situation where I have that

172
00:07:24,449 --> 00:07:27,720
many scripts I try something else first

173
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:30,750
because most game developers to be able

174
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,909
to debug their game while it's running

175
00:07:32,909 --> 00:07:34,349
and to manipulator to test if

176
00:07:34,349 --> 00:07:36,030
everything's working they expose the

177
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:38,520
game object like I did with Pete so I

178
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,919
check for game what's the first thing I

179
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:41,270
do

180
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:43,949
there's no game unfortunately maybe

181
00:07:43,949 --> 00:07:45,750
they've got clever and had the capital G

182
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:50,460
but that nah doesn't seem to work as

183
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:52,830
well so I'm screwed and I have to check

184
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:58,500
the source again and check for something

185
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,690
candies candy sounds very good because I

186
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:02,280
get candies and I would assume that

187
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:04,650
something happening where the candies is

188
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:08,039
in the candies J s and here in the

189
00:08:08,039 --> 00:08:09,780
script I see that the bar statement for

190
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:12,030
the candies object is directly in the

191
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:13,860
file so I know it's on the global scope

192
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:17,580
and I try that out and let's see if

193
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,469
there's actually a candy and there is a

194
00:08:19,469 --> 00:08:22,650
candies object so what do I got here and

195
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:26,039
that console suck I got candies per

196
00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:27,810
second oh that sounds very interesting

197
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:29,310
let's try that

198
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:35,219
candies dot candies per second equals 2

199
00:08:35,219 --> 00:08:40,740
1 3 3 7 marvelous so I don't want to

200
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:43,409
wait that long so try to explore that a

201
00:08:43,409 --> 00:08:46,350
little bit and make the game progress

202
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:47,910
first there's the merchants you have to

203
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:49,650
wait until you got Hoonah candies so in

204
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:52,050
that 100 I can buy the wooden sword now

205
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:53,520
and the couple sword and the iron sword

206
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,840
and the service hole in the diamond

207
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:57,510
sword I can use 101 candies to encrust

208
00:08:57,510 --> 00:09:00,840
it and now in my inventory I have the

209
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:03,390
candy diamond sword usually for the

210
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:05,340
first quest peaceful forest I only have

211
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:08,850
to kill trees the wooden sword would be

212
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:11,250
enough but it is much more faster with

213
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:12,930
them and so because they immediately die

214
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:15,060
and I can progress through the quests

215
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:18,210
the extra goal is to beat all the quests

216
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:20,790
there's like 14 quest I think and

217
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:22,230
there's even one quest where the end

218
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:25,620
pose is the developer I only beat that

219
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:28,620
level by putting a breakpoint into the

220
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:30,810
game and setting the HP of the developer

221
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:38,340
to zero but it worked and since the coat

222
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:41,100
is so nice and clean and not mini fight

223
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:43,440
and it obfuscated it's very easy to to

224
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,980
heck obviously the developer of that

225
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:48,540
game realized that and made some

226
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:50,910
improvements and candy box too so this

227
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:53,940
is the sequel to candy box and it's

228
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:57,180
basically the same game there's lots of

229
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:58,860
more features and some changes in the

230
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:03,380
game and if we check these sources again

231
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:09,090
we find the candy box to J's so oh

232
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:12,300
that will take more time to heck

233
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:15,810
actually but on chrome there's this nice

234
00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:18,270
button in the left here called pretty

235
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:22,280
print and pretty print pretty prints

236
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:24,570
obfuscated code so it's better readable

237
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:26,330
it doesn't change the variable names

238
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:28,910
unless you get access to the net file

239
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:30,930
unfortunately I don't have access to the

240
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:33,870
nab file because the deployed version of

241
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:35,430
the JavaScript doesn't include the death

242
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:37,500
map tech which is very good for him

243
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,780
obviously he realized that something or

244
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:43,370
she that players hacked the game and

245
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:45,570
yeah and now I can start putting

246
00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:47,070
breakpoints on here and beat the game as

247
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:49,110
well but I don't want to export the

248
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:51,300
second candy box I just want to actually

249
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:54,960
want to show you another game cookie

250
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:57,390
clicker probably many of you know the

251
00:10:57,390 --> 00:11:02,150
game cookie clicker

252
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:07,260
come on obviously this is some safe game

253
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:10,810
no I don't want to can i reset the game

254
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:20,130
somewhere settings options options wipe

255
00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:24,640
very good do it okay cuca click has a

256
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,370
very nice game

257
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:28,779
there's the cookie you click it you get

258
00:11:28,779 --> 00:11:29,230
the cookie

259
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:32,500
and when you have 15 cookies to get a

260
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,900
cursor which means now I get zero point

261
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:37,270
one cookie per second and I can click

262
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:39,279
over and open open open oval again and I

263
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:41,980
can buy a second cursor when I have 100

264
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:45,010
cookies I get the grandma and then I get

265
00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:48,450
the factory and the cookie farm and some

266
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:51,250
quantum physics operating machine who

267
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:52,720
does like a trillion cookies a second

268
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:55,420
but you know me I'm not very patient

269
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:57,100
when it comes to games I want to see

270
00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:00,700
everything right away and I tried the

271
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:02,710
first thing again which I did with the

272
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:05,050
Pete game yeah I check out the button

273
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:07,780
and then for fortunately this is a just

274
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:10,839
plain hot email HTML and JavaScript

275
00:12:10,839 --> 00:12:13,450
flash games are not that easy to hack

276
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:15,970
you would need to like use some kind of

277
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:18,010
tool for that but I don't like that

278
00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:21,220
and yeah this is a button again with the

279
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:25,420
IDE and I think we can try out if I am

280
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:29,080
able to do the same trick I did with

281
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:35,430
Pete so I have the jQuery here right yes

282
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:44,130
and then now we get the big cookie and

283
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:47,730
that works as well and I can click it I

284
00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:52,030
can click it so the rest is easy set

285
00:12:52,030 --> 00:13:05,040
interval German keyboards

286
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:10,820
boom nice so that is very good but yeah

287
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:12,080
the achievements are popping all over

288
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:14,540
this place I'm so good I get all the

289
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:16,430
achievements and now I can buy a time

290
00:13:16,430 --> 00:13:18,620
directly without having to have a

291
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:23,360
grandma but you can imagine there's

292
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:26,029
quite some objects here and the list

293
00:13:26,029 --> 00:13:27,500
grows and grows it only shows you the

294
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:33,020
next two so I'm patient as I am let's

295
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:37,339
check the source code if we can speed

296
00:13:37,339 --> 00:13:40,660
this process up there's some main.js and

297
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:45,320
the main J s is quite some fire lots of

298
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:48,970
lines were your markup game code

299
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:50,930
interesting game girls and they all

300
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:54,550
explain very nice thank you very much

301
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:57,770
cookies earn cookies cookies PS is

302
00:13:57,770 --> 00:14:00,339
probably cookies per second cookie

303
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:03,490
frenzy frenzy max power clique frenzy

304
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:06,230
golden cliques sometimes there appears

305
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:08,240
like a golden thingy here and I can

306
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,680
click it and I get some extra cookies

307
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,230
but what I'm actually interested in is

308
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:15,170
if there's the possibility to manipulate

309
00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:17,029
the buildings directly instead of you

310
00:14:17,029 --> 00:14:19,150
know clicking the button automatically

311
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:21,890
so let's check out the console if we

312
00:14:21,890 --> 00:14:26,480
have some kind of game object again okay

313
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,250
that's a diff container don't care for

314
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:30,680
that oh and there is a game object is it

315
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:33,529
the right one let's see oh that looks

316
00:14:33,529 --> 00:14:38,360
very nice so what do we got here we got

317
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:40,959
big cookie sighs we got can click

318
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:43,190
interesting so there's obviously some

319
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:45,650
kind of cheat prevention maybe this gets

320
00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:47,990
set to zero when you click so that it's

321
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:50,450
preventing you from clicking thousands

322
00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:52,700
of times per second but obviously it

323
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:54,730
doesn't do the job very good

324
00:14:54,730 --> 00:15:05,640
and let's see objects by ID what's that

325
00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:08,570
how to clicks once every 10 seconds

326
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:10,760
cursor so that's obviously the buildings

327
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:14,990
and there's 14 of them so the best

328
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:17,210
podium probably is the last one

329
00:15:17,210 --> 00:15:21,170
and the array and the numbers look quite

330
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:25,040
nice they're in very many zeroes the

331
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,830
prism converts light itself into cookies

332
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:31,130
yeah that's what I'm going for but to

333
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:33,500
make sure what are the values I can set

334
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:36,050
so there is an amount and there is

335
00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:39,830
bought and attract us once if you only

336
00:15:39,830 --> 00:15:42,380
update one of those values it does

337
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:44,900
nothing because the game internally

338
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:48,710
checks and match see if those numbers

339
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:51,950
match to see if the user cheated so what

340
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:53,990
we have to do is we have to increase

341
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:57,950
both of them okay let's try that so it

342
00:15:57,950 --> 00:16:03,410
was game object by ID then we got 14 so

343
00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:08,390
I need 13 and then amount equals some

344
00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:14,120
crazy biggest number and then the same

345
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:28,370
number for game object 13.4 and I think

346
00:16:28,370 --> 00:16:29,920
I broke it

347
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:35,170
yeah happens from time to time oh snap

348
00:16:35,170 --> 00:16:38,980
if you get too crazy with the numbers

349
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:43,070
the game's kind of crash so maybe we try

350
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:48,770
a thousand that works much better and

351
00:16:48,770 --> 00:16:52,310
the achievements are rolling in again so

352
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:54,890
let's quickly just close it see if

353
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:56,000
everything's correct

354
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,900
I get the prism a thousand times great

355
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:01,610
and I get two point nine trillion

356
00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:04,500
cookies per second

357
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:07,990
that's something I can work with for my

358
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:11,110
next game anyone here working at game

359
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:17,049
porch no great anyone working at big

360
00:17:17,049 --> 00:17:21,100
point you would like that no okay I used

361
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:25,829
to work at both the next game is Oh game

362
00:17:25,829 --> 00:17:28,860
this is a very classic browser game

363
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:32,770
which actually works with PHP which

364
00:17:32,770 --> 00:17:34,600
means most of the clicks you do trigger

365
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,970
a refresh of the page which is very

366
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:38,650
unfortunate because I cannot run myself

367
00:17:38,650 --> 00:17:40,330
interval stuff or anything like that

368
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:42,100
because if I actually do an interaction

369
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:43,960
with the game the page gets reloaded my

370
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:49,720
script is gone and to of course when the

371
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,250
page is reloaded this request to the

372
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:53,020
server they validate stuff you do so

373
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:57,250
there's not much to actually sheet to

374
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:59,950
progress in the game and that's good

375
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:01,419
because that's a multiplayer game and

376
00:18:01,419 --> 00:18:02,919
singer player games developers users

377
00:18:02,919 --> 00:18:04,659
don't care about preventing players to

378
00:18:04,659 --> 00:18:06,940
cheat because why should they there is

379
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:08,890
no competition with other players and

380
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:11,530
you don't necessarily need to prevent

381
00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:13,210
the cheating thing unless you have

382
00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:15,669
something like a competition which is

383
00:18:15,669 --> 00:18:17,919
where you collect the stats and you see

384
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:19,960
okay the best player of my game actually

385
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,850
wins something then you want to prevent

386
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:23,860
cheating but unless you don't have that

387
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:26,169
don't care about it people will do it

388
00:18:26,169 --> 00:18:26,590
anyway

389
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:28,390
there's the cheat engine where you can

390
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:30,940
read the memory stats and it's a waste

391
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:32,500
of time if you just do a single player

392
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:36,130
game and for this game I had to actually

393
00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:37,840
play it a little bit I played the back

394
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:40,679
in 2000 I don't know 4 or something

395
00:18:40,679 --> 00:18:43,150
because there's one thing in the game

396
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:44,650
which gets really annoying this is a

397
00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:46,220
game and the

398
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:47,990
in a universe where you have planets and

399
00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:50,330
you can build on the planets and minds

400
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:52,310
and chips and then you can take your

401
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:54,170
fleet and attack other players and

402
00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:57,230
there's one thing you do very often you

403
00:18:57,230 --> 00:18:59,750
get those planets here and they also

404
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:02,120
produce resources but usually you build

405
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:04,670
your fleet on your main planet so what

406
00:19:04,670 --> 00:19:07,100
you do is you click on the planet page

407
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:09,260
goods reloaded you click on the fleet

408
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:11,780
button page gets reloaded you select the

409
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:13,460
ships you want to send and click on next

410
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:17,030
page gets reloaded you check a short

411
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:19,730
link for the planet and back in the days

412
00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:22,160
those didn't exist it you have to type

413
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,590
the coordinates manually pain in the ass

414
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:30,890
and then you click again Paige gets

415
00:19:30,890 --> 00:19:33,380
reloaded and you are no right I have to

416
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:36,230
choose the nation so transport select

417
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:37,850
all the resources and then I can click

418
00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:40,160
flutter to then sending my fleet to the

419
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:43,220
extra planet so what about what I did

420
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:48,110
here I know that I cannot use the other

421
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:50,360
script and just paste it in and it will

422
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:51,980
do the magic because there the page

423
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:54,110
reloads but I know that I can manipulate

424
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:59,450
bookmarks if you have a bookmark and you

425
00:19:59,450 --> 00:20:02,720
just type JavaScript and then you can

426
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:05,360
add JavaScript code there I use this

427
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,910
very often to prevent Google from when

428
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:09,470
you search on Google sometimes they

429
00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:11,450
notice you that they have new TOS or

430
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:13,340
something with the overlay and you have

431
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:16,250
to agree to them unless you don't want

432
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:18,920
to use Google anymore and I have the

433
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,960
bookmark which actually removes the

434
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,730
entire div and I can just continue

435
00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:24,980
search without ever agreeing so the new

436
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:27,410
terms of service which is very nice I

437
00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:29,960
think I'm on the TOS from melon or four

438
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:33,170
years ago and I did the same here so I

439
00:20:33,170 --> 00:20:34,910
have three bookmarks the first is fleet

440
00:20:34,910 --> 00:20:37,340
one fleet one just selects all my

441
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:40,310
transport ships and clicks Next and it

442
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:42,590
doesn't actually just click Next there

443
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:44,780
is a function they expose the globe

444
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:47,060
scope because the game is mostly written

445
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:49,190
in PHP but they have some JavaScript

446
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:50,990
functions there to help them make it a

447
00:20:50,990 --> 00:20:52,280
little bit more dynamic like to the

448
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:54,080
accounts and stuff and they also have to

449
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,610
try submit function the global scope

450
00:20:55,610 --> 00:20:58,160
which is used on the fleets screen to

451
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,320
actually

452
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:03,370
try to submit their javascript form and

453
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:05,740
you can use that so I just click send

454
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:08,230
all and then call the function try

455
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:10,180
separate and that work I'm on the next

456
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:12,700
screen next step is the fleet to

457
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:14,950
bookmark and can you read through that

458
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:16,060
Yeah right

459
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:19,050
so I select the span from the planets

460
00:21:19,050 --> 00:21:24,040
with the anchor and then click it which

461
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:25,870
actually does this little short thing

462
00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:31,900
here then the selection pops out and I

463
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:35,800
select after that the ul initialized L

464
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,630
II which is the first element of the

465
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:39,850
list you have to do the inspecting for

466
00:21:39,850 --> 00:21:43,870
that and then again try the try sublet

467
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:46,510
button and it works and then for the

468
00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:50,140
last screen I do the set selected

469
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:52,360
function this is another public function

470
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:55,780
for the mission select then the next

471
00:21:55,780 --> 00:22:00,430
thing is the update mission one thing

472
00:22:00,430 --> 00:22:05,500
the first first part in here the set

473
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:08,770
selected just renders around an orange

474
00:22:08,770 --> 00:22:11,350
box around the transport and the next

475
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:14,200
one actually clicks it and then usually

476
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,910
when you click it this opens and you can

477
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:17,080
fill the bellies and there's buttons

478
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:19,570
here for automatically setting all the

479
00:22:19,570 --> 00:22:21,910
resources and if you're very good at

480
00:22:21,910 --> 00:22:25,240
looking you can see the change oh and if

481
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:26,560
I'm good at clicking you can actually

482
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:29,440
see the change you see the numbers get

483
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,880
filled in and my fleet is underway

484
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,890
usually if you do all this process by

485
00:22:32,890 --> 00:22:35,290
hand it takes up to five minutes sending

486
00:22:35,290 --> 00:22:37,690
all your ships from all your sub planets

487
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:39,010
to your main planet and you can have up

488
00:22:39,010 --> 00:22:41,500
to twelve planets so it will take up a

489
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:42,940
significant amount of time while you

490
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:44,380
play and I don't want to wait especially

491
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:46,990
if I get attacked to get attacked I want

492
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:48,880
to save all my fleets immediately and

493
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:51,400
what I just do is I select the planet

494
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:53,980
and then I just click fleet one fleet

495
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:57,730
two three three and select plate three

496
00:22:57,730 --> 00:23:01,600
and select the next planet and why

497
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,100
should you do that why should you heck

498
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:05,500
the games because you learn a lot on how

499
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:10,150
other other game developers or

500
00:23:10,150 --> 00:23:12,220
developers in general solve their

501
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:12,999
problems how

502
00:23:12,999 --> 00:23:15,069
try to prevent cheating and there's a

503
00:23:15,069 --> 00:23:17,139
nice example in drips that that's

504
00:23:17,139 --> 00:23:18,879
another Idol game the last one I show

505
00:23:18,879 --> 00:23:23,589
you today any one of you writes Java you

506
00:23:23,589 --> 00:23:26,349
will like that maybe a lot so this is a

507
00:23:26,349 --> 00:23:28,869
memory leak Idol game now you create new

508
00:23:28,869 --> 00:23:31,839
objects to leak memory and once you have

509
00:23:31,839 --> 00:23:33,189
leaked enough you can drop the memory

510
00:23:33,189 --> 00:23:35,649
and there's actually multiplayer

511
00:23:35,649 --> 00:23:39,219
involved where people are compared to

512
00:23:39,219 --> 00:23:41,109
each other depending on how much memory

513
00:23:41,109 --> 00:23:43,959
they have leaked and what the game

514
00:23:43,959 --> 00:23:45,399
actually supports I don't know if we

515
00:23:45,399 --> 00:23:48,549
will be able to see this is that you can

516
00:23:48,549 --> 00:23:51,129
connect a virtual machine to that game

517
00:23:51,129 --> 00:23:53,139
which does all the heavy lifting for you

518
00:23:53,139 --> 00:23:57,159
like clicking and stuff so quickly try

519
00:23:57,159 --> 00:24:01,089
to do the little heck with a click event

520
00:24:01,089 --> 00:24:08,259
button at memory console and again what

521
00:24:08,259 --> 00:24:10,149
was it

522
00:24:10,149 --> 00:24:17,949
bitten at something BTN - admin button -

523
00:24:17,949 --> 00:24:26,499
add you here yes can I click you as a

524
00:24:26,499 --> 00:24:29,709
perk is there another thing in there

525
00:24:29,709 --> 00:24:34,599
No Oh doesn't work anymore I used to

526
00:24:34,599 --> 00:24:39,249
work that's it okay you could now

527
00:24:39,249 --> 00:24:41,199
technically inspector JavaScript and

528
00:24:41,199 --> 00:24:42,759
find the button there's also a Chrome

529
00:24:42,759 --> 00:24:46,449
extension which cheats for you it

530
00:24:46,449 --> 00:24:49,359
because you can also buy the upgrades

531
00:24:49,359 --> 00:24:52,329
here for the cursors and everything

532
00:24:52,329 --> 00:24:54,099
which clicks automatically and there's

533
00:24:54,099 --> 00:24:55,959
like the perfect path you can go

534
00:24:55,959 --> 00:24:57,909
depending on when do you spend your

535
00:24:57,909 --> 00:24:59,799
memory on upgrades and when you just

536
00:24:59,799 --> 00:25:02,469
drip it and everything and this thing

537
00:25:02,469 --> 00:25:04,389
does everything for you and if you are

538
00:25:04,389 --> 00:25:06,249
too crazy about the sheeting and I think

539
00:25:06,249 --> 00:25:09,369
I had like 25 set intervals running on

540
00:25:09,369 --> 00:25:11,229
the click button sometime and then

541
00:25:11,229 --> 00:25:13,929
suddenly the page showed me hey it looks

542
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:15,639
like you're cheating please reload the

543
00:25:15,639 --> 00:25:18,219
page once you reload the page you're

544
00:25:18,219 --> 00:25:20,799
back to the beginning and have to click

545
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:24,669
again yeah so I think this was

546
00:25:24,669 --> 00:25:26,440
everything I wanted to show you

547
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:28,179
and I want to encourage you to hack the

548
00:25:28,179 --> 00:25:30,159
games police is not here yet that's very

549
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:34,539
good so we have time for questions thank

550
00:25:34,539 --> 00:26:35,390
you

551
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:38,440
this ability to set the coordinates

552
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:45,940
where you have to click or different

553
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:47,880
technically you could read the

554
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:50,740
coordinates from the page and then just

555
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:52,900
menu it trigger a click event there

556
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:55,720
which is not that easy because to

557
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:58,630
actually trigger manually manual click

558
00:26:58,630 --> 00:27:02,080
events you have to dispatch them to a

559
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:05,350
element and then the element itself is

560
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:07,510
clicked not just a spot in the element

561
00:27:07,510 --> 00:27:10,870
so it is quite tricky without extensions

562
00:27:10,870 --> 00:27:14,140
to click in flash games but there is a

563
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:15,700
thing called the cheat engine you have

564
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:17,650
to deactivate your antivirus software

565
00:27:17,650 --> 00:27:19,690
for that because of kind of acts like a

566
00:27:19,690 --> 00:27:20,500
Trojan horse

567
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:24,270
and this lets you reach memory from

568
00:27:24,270 --> 00:27:26,890
tasks used from processes you select and

569
00:27:26,890 --> 00:27:29,050
what you do is you go on the game you

570
00:27:29,050 --> 00:27:31,170
take a number for example your gold and

571
00:27:31,170 --> 00:27:33,850
you put that number like you have 500

572
00:27:33,850 --> 00:27:35,230
gold you put that into the cheat engine

573
00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:37,240
and then it lists you all the

574
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:39,250
information cut where the number 500 us

575
00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:40,810
and you go back in the game again and

576
00:27:40,810 --> 00:27:43,840
spend some of your gold and then you put

577
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:46,450
that number you have left like 250 back

578
00:27:46,450 --> 00:27:48,220
in the memory and then you get a

579
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:51,160
filtered list from your previous memory

580
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:53,290
addresses and the next memory addresses

581
00:27:53,290 --> 00:27:55,150
and then you compare those and then you

582
00:27:55,150 --> 00:27:57,220
find a memory entry where the gold is

583
00:27:57,220 --> 00:27:58,510
actually stored and then you can

584
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:00,730
manipulate it and go back in the game

585
00:28:00,730 --> 00:28:03,940
and well last see that there's the

586
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:07,990
different amount but in flash games like

587
00:28:07,990 --> 00:28:09,880
I said it's much mahalo and usually they

588
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:13,990
have something like cached game stats

589
00:28:13,990 --> 00:28:16,480
which they compare on each tick to see

590
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,880
if the user is cheating because you can

591
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:22,210
easily calculate how many gold you can

592
00:28:22,210 --> 00:28:24,460
get per tick or something like that and

593
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:26,800
but it works for most of the games on

594
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:29,230
Kongregate and armor games and stuff

595
00:28:29,230 --> 00:28:45,810
like that

596
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:50,570
I was thinking about how to find the

597
00:28:50,570 --> 00:29:09,170
velvet ice and constantly yeah it

598
00:29:09,170 --> 00:29:11,210
depends again if it is single-player

599
00:29:11,210 --> 00:29:13,220
multiplayer if it does multiplayer you

600
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:15,590
have to do some serious stuff to prevent

601
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:17,060
this and there is back-end checks of

602
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:19,940
course to do that you can also do like

603
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:22,070
hashes of your game stats which you

604
00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:23,900
store somewhere deep in your game and

605
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:26,240
then compare those for single-player

606
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,880
games I wouldn't really care if you

607
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,410
really want to care there's multiple

608
00:29:30,410 --> 00:29:32,660
ways you can use the local storage you

609
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:34,670
can if you run on the in Chrome they

610
00:29:34,670 --> 00:29:37,250
have an open database where you can have

611
00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:40,100
a little SQL database but the problem

612
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:42,560
the browser is that the user always has

613
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:44,480
access to everything you cannot hide

614
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,730
something from the user only in the

615
00:29:46,730 --> 00:29:58,210
browser

616
00:29:58,220 --> 00:30:00,299
right and that's something you don't

617
00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:02,400
want to you don't want to use us to have

618
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,230
kind of experience reloading the page

619
00:30:04,230 --> 00:30:06,000
every time you click like in the old

620
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,710
game yeah but still they take time and

621
00:30:10,710 --> 00:30:18,700
in those idle games usually very fast

622
00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:20,010
yeah

623
00:30:20,010 --> 00:30:22,500
and then you risk getting a decent and

624
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:24,690
you have two states one of the front end

625
00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:26,130
a different from the back end and that

626
00:30:26,130 --> 00:30:27,780
kind of feels like cheating to the back

627
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:30,330
end because the user was too fast and

628
00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:32,940
have to be very careful with that to not

629
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:35,160
ruin the user experience because and

630
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:37,230
when when your website breaks people

631
00:30:37,230 --> 00:30:39,419
usually reload the page if you game

632
00:30:39,419 --> 00:30:41,490
breaks people usually throw it away and

633
00:30:41,490 --> 00:30:54,929
take the next game yeah sure feel free

634
00:30:54,929 --> 00:30:57,419
to talk to me and add me on Twitter if

635
00:30:57,419 --> 00:30:59,790
you want to know more about that stuff

636
00:30:59,790 --> 00:31:02,640
Luka JEP oh maybe I can quickly open it

637
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,640
and you can see the name

638
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:10,530
hopefully other it's very small there

639
00:31:10,530 --> 00:31:14,850
Luke like Skywalker and TEP like TEP

640
00:31:14,850 --> 00:31:27,919
like TCP yeah thank you
