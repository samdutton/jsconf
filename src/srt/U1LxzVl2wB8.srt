1
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:14,040

so I'm Randy um I maintain a QR code

2
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:17,670
package for men p.m. so it's kind of

3
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:19,500
neat you can npm install QR code and

4
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:23,740
generate QR codes for your applications

5
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:26,939
stuff maybe how to make a QR code with

6
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:30,240
node what kind of error correction do

7
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:34,170
they have inside of them how to take it

8
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:36,149
way out of spec and put your own crap in

9
00:00:36,149 --> 00:00:40,200
it because they're not very good looking

10
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,700
unless you have it night next to the

11
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:46,050
cool like jsk confe 8-bit font and then

12
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:48,200
Adam maybe sticks and bacon behind one

13
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:51,149
and then it's JavaScript so you can do

14
00:00:51,149 --> 00:00:59,960
in the client side too like every day

15
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:02,809
when I'm playing out these QR codes I

16
00:01:02,809 --> 00:01:06,540
get a disappointed right I bring it up

17
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:08,130
on my phone share with like barcode

18
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:10,740
scanner on Android and doesn't scan like

19
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:12,659
an iPhone user couldn't scan it right

20
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:14,400
and we're like inches apart at night mr.

21
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,960
greens backlit but in other situations

22
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:20,520
they work great you know other times I'm

23
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:21,960
not disappointed you know you see them

24
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,159
on the sides of buildings you see them

25
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:26,070
all over the place you know so you know

26
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:28,979
people seem to put them on stuff and I

27
00:01:28,979 --> 00:01:30,840
think it's more of the mystery like what

28
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:35,400
is inside of that QR code you know I

29
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,530
mean sometimes you just want to know all

30
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:39,150
right sometimes you're like that could

31
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:44,729
be you know in fact it is a clue give

32
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:48,299
you all sorts of funny things and they

33
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:51,990
can hold about 1.2 k so you can stick I

34
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:56,909
mean they get pretty big and with the

35
00:01:56,909 --> 00:02:01,260
highest level of error correction

36
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:04,729
so uh it's like I said before it looked

37
00:02:04,729 --> 00:02:07,670
kind of neat if there next to this like

38
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:12,980
real blocky text but uh when you put

39
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:16,700
this on your website or you you know

40
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:18,709
print it on your advertisement you

41
00:02:18,709 --> 00:02:20,930
really are sacrificing a big portion of

42
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:22,760
your real estate right there's no brand

43
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:25,370
identity there's it's just not very fun

44
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:27,980
and there's nothing to do with bacon at

45
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:38,410
all um c making a QR code with note just

46
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:42,709
npm install QR code you can have some

47
00:02:42,709 --> 00:02:44,870
problems just because of dependencies on

48
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:47,000
kiro I don't know if everybody has an

49
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,400
up-to-date version of Cairo but if you

50
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:52,220
happen to get one in the middle node

51
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:53,959
canvas will install and seem to work

52
00:02:53,959 --> 00:02:56,680
perfectly but I will be unable to

53
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:59,030
extract data from images it'll be unable

54
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:01,340
to write images to the canvas so that's

55
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:02,810
a big breaker if you're going to try and

56
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:05,600
try and put weird things on a underneath

57
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:16,670
your QR codes stuff the API pretty

58
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:19,100
simple I'm basically exporting the

59
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:21,049
functions that the canvas itself

60
00:03:21,049 --> 00:03:25,130
provides ability to send a you know

61
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:29,570
today to URL save it to a file simply

62
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:37,010
draw it and return a canvas object so I

63
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:38,060
mean that's how to do it it's not that

64
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:39,530
complicated i tried to propose a

65
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:41,180
minimalistic api there's a lot more

66
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:43,340
options for configurability in a version

67
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:46,760
i'm going to push tonight maybe that'll

68
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,140
allow you to configure like the module

69
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:49,430
size and stuff like that provide

70
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:54,030
additional options see

71
00:03:54,030 --> 00:04:00,450
um let's see so that's not really a last

72
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:09,060
slide so uh whoa um I recently

73
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:13,110
refactored this code because I was

74
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:14,790
putting the global space on the client

75
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:16,530
side with a bunch of variables because I

76
00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:18,120
was kind of hacking around the fact that

77
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,630
I have synchronous model loading or

78
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:23,040
module loading in a node but a

79
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,630
synchronous module loading on the client

80
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:27,090
side on this library is fully come you

81
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:28,530
know its candidate uses the canvas it

82
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:30,630
works totally on the client side you can

83
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:33,780
just you know pipe stuff the QR code

84
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:38,250
gets more data and you know and they're

85
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:39,630
just works you can scan it you so you

86
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:43,380
can choose to render your QR codes

87
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:45,240
dynamically on the client with whatever

88
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,740
information they want post them back to

89
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:48,510
the server or you can generate them on

90
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:54,810
the server yourself but uh getting

91
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:58,590
creative with QR codes I mean that when

92
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:00,300
the scanner actually reads a QR code

93
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:03,690
it's a it's taking just the gray scale

94
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:06,270
of the image so like the background

95
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:08,100
could be bright yellow and it would work

96
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:10,380
just fine right it could be a very

97
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:11,970
bright color it could be like a bright

98
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:13,860
green which has the most the most

99
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:17,370
influence on our eyes and it wouldn't

100
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:19,620
influence that it wouldn't harm the data

101
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:21,840
at all in any way people could read it

102
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,360
from very far away it'd be very obvious

103
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:33,990
right that it was yours so see um with

104
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:36,630
canvas you can do things like you know

105
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:39,750
round edges this is terrible sorry gotta

106
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:44,520
zoom in or something um anyway okay so

107
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:50,540
uh Livy show you some cut

108
00:05:50,550 --> 00:06:00,900
or not

109
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:11,810
so wow that's terrible I'm sorry White

110
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:23,540
will give you 10 C so I said like we can

111
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:26,660
mess with it in funny ways I can I made

112
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:28,070
a little web api can pass the net effect

113
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:31,190
right rounded and I can draw it and get

114
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:33,620
a canvas back I can do a bunch of

115
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:35,270
inefficient things with the canvas and

116
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:39,410
lots of weird ways and then I changed

117
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:42,200
the result right it's now like a canvas

118
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,390
with slightly rounded checkmarks that's

119
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:51,890
kind of neat I I wanted to make sure

120
00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:56,210
that I could Brandi QR code and with

121
00:06:56,210 --> 00:06:58,670
like a logo or something and have it

122
00:06:58,670 --> 00:07:00,860
retain its data not compromise the

123
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:05,470
clients ability to understand it and and

124
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:07,430
bacon is a pretty good choice actually

125
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:09,710
because Browns are very dark it's

126
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:10,880
actually very difficult to desaturate

127
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:14,060
Browns I made some functions that

128
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:17,090
convert rgb2 y UV and reduce the

129
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:18,860
luminosity of the colors which is the

130
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:23,870
algorithm that's used in grayscale so to

131
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:28,310
make bacon theme QR codes I this will

132
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:30,370
scan just fine it's got a bacon heart

133
00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:33,140
because i'm actually really sick of

134
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:37,010
bacon because njs comp to free jas comp

135
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:38,600
i was really excited about bacon now I'm

136
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:42,470
kind of done but it's still I still love

137
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:44,930
bacon I mean you can really just put

138
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:47,120
anything back there right as long as you

139
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,970
can ensure that the colors are light

140
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:52,850
enough and I provided a function with

141
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:56,840
the canvas utility that will ensure that

142
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:59,090
all pixels can be pushed below that

143
00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:02,330
threshold and I made a little API and

144
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:04,670
the tests to be able to like show how to

145
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:09,280
do that

146
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:12,660
yeah yeah thank you please ask more

147
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:15,120
questions because I'm nervous and never

148
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:27,940
talk with thank you let's see um bacon

149
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:33,419
see so simply I just have this is just

150
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:35,160
my test file it's not designed to be an

151
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:37,380
API yet I mean I could expose these kind

152
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:40,560
of bacon effects as a as an API and who

153
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:43,830
knows everybody likes bacon and there's

154
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:45,450
a bacon bikini effect but i don't know

155
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:49,450
if i should show the resulting QR code

156
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:53,340
should anybody later cuz bacon bikinis

157
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:56,340
are like a actually very top so very

158
00:08:56,340 --> 00:09:01,140
high google image result for bacon let's

159
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:07,590
see um so how to process the image now I

160
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:09,600
I wrote this code last night so it's not

161
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,980
like the best and I'm sure there's gonna

162
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:17,120
be some free variables but it works I i

163
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:22,470
set a dark and a light threshold then i

164
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:26,100
make sure that the image will fit as

165
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:28,350
best as possible you know I'll crop it

166
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:31,680
off on the longest side and so you know

167
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,300
an image that's a that's a wide

168
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:35,610
rectangle will get the end cut off cut

169
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:41,240
off I have a just a pixel helper I'm

170
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:45,630
provided by a canvas util library I put

171
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:48,390
on NPM just iterates over pixels you

172
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:50,670
pass it to canvas as like a generic call

173
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:52,860
back this is the raw function for

174
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:56,730
calculating luminosity which is which

175
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:59,880
after I wrote that I also pass to I've

176
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:04,140
added it to a library it's the

177
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:05,850
calculation of luminosity is based on

178
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:09,180
the seven or nine coefficients those are

179
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:11,760
used in HDTV I'm rather than the 60

180
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,920
whatever something are there but they're

181
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,720
just magic numbers that make them the

182
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:19,320
these specific magic numbers that a

183
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:31,410
a weighted average to your pixels these

184
00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:35,340
are things that you can use to if you

185
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:38,940
wanted to to customize a QR code right

186
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:42,330
you can my library at its core just

187
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:45,090
provides a QR code it's it's just it's

188
00:10:45,090 --> 00:10:48,360
to spec right this is how you can make

189
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:51,600
it out of spec but still readable really

190
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,680
a lot of this stuff i would like to

191
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,720
expose like just export a few kind of

192
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,040
trick functions that would allow you to

193
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:02,310
underlay any background I just like I've

194
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:04,650
made a bug and I couldn't I had to roll

195
00:11:04,650 --> 00:11:12,690
back anyway this is my oh my development

196
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:15,530
branch of note QR code it's on github

197
00:11:15,530 --> 00:11:18,930
and I will finish the tests today and

198
00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:22,440
get it up so you'll be able to basically

199
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,990
provide any image as a background and

200
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:28,560
the code will decent will will either

201
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,030
darken or lighten the pixels

202
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:32,790
appropriately and then your code will

203
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:35,580
just work right so you know you have

204
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:37,830
like a node.js logo and PM logo you can

205
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:39,720
put anything right in the middle and you

206
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,130
know that the library is going to take

207
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:44,070
care of ensuring that I mean it's just a

208
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:46,950
simple number 1 through 100 and about 50

209
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:49,860
is the distance you need if you see like

210
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:57,510
you know 2575 anyway um and then if the

211
00:11:57,510 --> 00:11:59,040
color is too light i just iterate the

212
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:02,340
pixels and then call back with the bacon

213
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:10,530
canvas so I don't know it works I guess

214
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:15,410
uh any questions

215
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:35,100
ah yes let me uh it is on my github it's

216
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:41,640
the repository node canvas util and I

217
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:45,930
should have pushed that up conversion

218
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:50,300
lip inside of conversion lip I've added

219
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:54,900
I grabbed some functions for from MJ

220
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:57,240
Jackson I don't know I don't have this

221
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:00,660
full name here I just included his is a

222
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:06,150
copyright rgb2 hsl hsl RGB RGB to HSV I

223
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:07,800
experimented with a lot of different

224
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:10,290
kinds of transforms I have one that

225
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:13,800
increases the brightness of of bright

226
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:16,230
colors which has an interesting behavior

227
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:18,720
when you're looking at like sunflowers

228
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,060
or something right you can have a super

229
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:23,010
like bright color and really subdued

230
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:25,380
colors underneath your QR code or I mean

231
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:29,370
under whatever right I did a lot of the

232
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:37,860
tests for that yeah it's just JavaScript

233
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:43,280
and it's just a canvas API when I see I

234
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:53,140
start that server

235
00:13:53,150 --> 00:14:15,030
see so this is an actual tests for for

236
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:18,540
the different algorithms for determining

237
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:22,010
gray scale and and different

238
00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:25,350
implementations anyway this column is

239
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:27,480
client-side this column is server side

240
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:32,100
and the same for the boat this is a kind

241
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:33,900
of derived from there's a fellow who

242
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:35,910
made some document documented some of

243
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:37,770
these gray scale functions but it turns

244
00:14:37,770 --> 00:14:40,080
out that this is like the correct one

245
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,700
that's the ones the phones use to

246
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:42,930
determine grayscale that's the most

247
00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:45,110
popular it's based on that HD standard

248
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:49,830
and let's see I actually implement those

249
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:52,830
transforms kind of with a plug-in

250
00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:59,320
architecture for canvas util let me just

251
00:14:59,330 --> 00:15:03,660
write here actually so it's let me

252
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:10,560
increase the size of that

253
00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:15,800
so I mean the average is average

254
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:18,890
luminosity all grayscale limo I Lamar

255
00:15:18,890 --> 00:15:24,290
and why a Brighton threshold basically

256
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:25,880
these are all filters to apply over any

257
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:27,710
canvas you can write anything to it

258
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:30,320
it'll just apply the filter blindly and

259
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,510
any plugin that goes into canvas you

260
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:34,670
till I mean can take advantage or extend

261
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:37,850
that pixel iterators behavior to apply

262
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:39,590
just kind of random crazy effects if

263
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:40,970
they want and it'll work on the client

264
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:45,020
side as well right in threshold

265
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:47,630
saturation threshold you know either put

266
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:49,310
you can choose instead of pushing colors

267
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:52,100
darker inside of their own range but to

268
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:53,600
actually push them towards white using

269
00:15:53,600 --> 00:16:03,440
HSV or hsl and yeah um note y UV is

270
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,770
actually a lossy as it's a Selassie

271
00:16:06,770 --> 00:16:09,560
algorithm so if you take rgb2 y UV and

272
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:11,570
back again you're going to end up with

273
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:13,370
slightly different colors it's the

274
00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:16,040
reason jpg is lossy and ends used an

275
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:20,840
MPEG compression as well so so those are

276
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:25,660
why those real haci algorithms but yeah

277
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:34,479
anything else

278
00:16:34,489 --> 00:16:41,339
huh Kate chilly I'm running this is my

279
00:16:41,339 --> 00:16:45,420
older opensuse box i'm using Katie it's

280
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:47,429
kinda I mean it's just all the all the

281
00:16:47,429 --> 00:16:50,429
que tu plugins the the Qt plugins like

282
00:16:50,429 --> 00:16:52,920
spider component the files file browser

283
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,329
component it's all just like a plug-in

284
00:16:54,329 --> 00:17:05,279
architecture all right yeah well thank
