1
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:21,500

you

2
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:25,240


3
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:28,490
so I started off

4
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:31,850
I talk vjj us but it's kind of migrated

5
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:35,300
more towards the subtitle now design

6
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:38,650
frack ability is what my master's thesis

7
00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:42,080
Media Lab Helsinki was about and I was

8
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:45,410
thinking of ways that to make coding

9
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:49,070
more accessible and and the way that I

10
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:50,750
have been exploring is dataflow

11
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:54,410
programming in the web browser so it's

12
00:00:54,410 --> 00:00:56,870
making coding more accessible for non

13
00:00:56,870 --> 00:01:01,129
coders but it also there's value for

14
00:01:01,129 --> 00:01:04,010
coders as well for encapsulating

15
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:06,950
functionality and making things reusable

16
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:09,440
and easy to take apart and change how

17
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:17,390
they work so Marc Andreessen said a

18
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:19,100
couple years ago the software is eating

19
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:22,640
the world and I kind of see that it

20
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,640
hasn't taken over things like building a

21
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:28,939
cabin like you still need a large stump

22
00:01:28,939 --> 00:01:33,350
to bash the pieces together but there

23
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:35,840
probably are software elements that went

24
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:40,159
into the design of those pieces so so my

25
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:43,850
thesis is that if software is eating the

26
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:46,159
world that more people should be writing

27
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:48,380
software and to be more accessible for

28
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:55,499
people to to try and to play with and

29
00:01:55,509 --> 00:02:01,520
yes so the concept of meta media is the

30
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:05,929
computer is basically all past media can

31
00:02:05,929 --> 00:02:10,610
be represented in a computer text images

32
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:15,560
video all of these things can can be

33
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:18,470
represented here and delivered here but

34
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:22,100
it also it also can be all future media

35
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:25,190
all always that we combine those old

36
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:27,680
types of media and to making new kinds

37
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,100
new things new tools and new ways of

38
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:34,370
communication in the same way that the

39
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:38,000
Internet is the the meta network it's

40
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,530
it's the network of all the other

41
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:40,290
networks

42
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:42,870
combined together I think that these two

43
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:45,569
concepts are a big reason of why I'm

44
00:02:45,569 --> 00:02:48,060
into programming and I'm into web

45
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:50,790
programming and probably a lot of you

46
00:02:50,790 --> 00:03:01,650
are as well so so one software is tools

47
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:04,680
for getting things done and this is a

48
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,900
picture of my grandpa and grandma in

49
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:12,720
1945 and she has been doing oil painting

50
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,760
and it was his job to make the frames

51
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:17,359
he's a carpenter he was making frames

52
00:03:17,359 --> 00:03:23,970
but he also got into computer and his

53
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:27,419
job there was to arrange the photos of

54
00:03:27,419 --> 00:03:29,730
the paintings on the page so that they

55
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:32,280
could be folded and made into a greeting

56
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:37,349
card and he showed me his workflow for

57
00:03:37,349 --> 00:03:40,049
for doing that and it was incredible he

58
00:03:40,049 --> 00:03:42,090
doesn't have photoshop or anything like

59
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:45,269
that like he used ms paint and something

60
00:03:45,269 --> 00:03:47,909
crazy that came with the printer he was

61
00:03:47,909 --> 00:03:50,519
totally bending these tools to do what

62
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:52,229
he wanted them to do even though they're

63
00:03:52,229 --> 00:03:54,510
completely not designed for that so I

64
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:56,099
think that's a it's a good example of

65
00:03:56,099 --> 00:03:58,290
somebody who came to computing very late

66
00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:00,810
late in life but figured it out and

67
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:02,519
figured out the tools that he had and

68
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:05,489
getting them to do what he wanted them

69
00:04:05,489 --> 00:04:09,000
to do and I think that this is a big

70
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,979
part of how he learned to use the

71
00:04:10,979 --> 00:04:12,150
computer how you learned to interface

72
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:14,280
with it I don't know if this was

73
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:17,039
intentional for Microsoft to include

74
00:04:17,039 --> 00:04:19,820
solitaire as practice for mouth

75
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:22,860
manipulation so you have clicking you

76
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:25,680
have drag and drop and and basically

77
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,130
like that that gives you the basics of

78
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:30,330
how to use the mouse how to interact

79
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:33,210
with a computer for somebody that that

80
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:35,610
didn't use a computer for 75 years and

81
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:39,210
then coming to it that late he used he

82
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:40,590
is this to learn how to interact with a

83
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:43,150
computer

84
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:48,200
and but now we have touchscreens and you

85
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,930
can interact with with media just by by

86
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:53,900
swiping like this so one year olds can

87
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:56,390
can look through photos on ipad or

88
00:04:56,390 --> 00:05:00,080
iphone and they do all the time and it's

89
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,780
completely natural to them so this UX

90
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:04,970
design is kind of bringing bringing

91
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:10,430
people closer to the media and and also

92
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:14,060
making it easier and more accessible so

93
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:16,460
if with touchscreens it's it's closer

94
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:18,350
than with the mouse it's closer than

95
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:21,260
with the command line interface like

96
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:25,520
when I started on computers I had to

97
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,700
learn how to use das in order to call up

98
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:33,260
commander keen into Newcomb and play the

99
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:36,980
game said I wanted to play but encode

100
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:39,290
we're still very much in this this text

101
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:41,540
based world and so I'm thinking of ways

102
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:45,410
that that we can apply this UX design of

103
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:48,910
more direct manipulation of logical

104
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:55,460
ideas so this is designed not for hack

105
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:59,930
ability the the icons iOS icons now

106
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:01,520
they're flat but they were these kind of

107
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:05,030
gemstone things that they can't they

108
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:06,530
don't really invite you to take them

109
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:09,590
apart and it's the same as the smart

110
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:11,870
phones they're like if you take them

111
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:13,970
apart then you can see the components

112
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:15,410
maybe know what they do but you're not

113
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:17,590
going to be able to do much with them

114
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:22,490
after that so so I wanted to make a

115
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:24,230
different metaphor for a software when

116
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:25,790
you take it apart you can see the pieces

117
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:29,480
and how they're communicating and then

118
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:36,110
actually do something with it so so this

119
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:40,160
is the Libra website and we have a

120
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,230
gallery of apps that you can start with

121
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:45,650
but how many people have done dataflow

122
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:49,310
programming and in some context like can

123
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:52,030
I see like vvvv

124
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:58,560
anybody quartz composer pure data max

125
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:06,010
LabVIEW anybody okay then nice so the

126
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:09,760
basic concept is you have at least here

127
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:12,040
you have this library of components and

128
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:14,230
you drag them out here and then to

129
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:16,510
connect them you you pull a wire from

130
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:20,530
here so go from the output to the input

131
00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:23,230
and then you said when you send signals

132
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:26,620
they they travel along these wires and

133
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:29,470
basically under under the hood all of

134
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:33,670
these all of these modules are our

135
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:36,330
classes and all the wires represents

136
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:39,670
event listeners so the outputs like

137
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:42,640
events and the event listeners send that

138
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:49,880
data to the inputs of the other modules

139
00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:53,350
so that's kind of the this is the

140
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:55,570
representation of what I what I want to

141
00:07:55,570 --> 00:07:58,120
wear I want to take apps like I want to

142
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:00,460
have this this interface that when you

143
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:02,470
open it up you can see the the boxes

144
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:05,590
inside and how they how they're

145
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:10,840
connected how they're communicating so

146
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:14,530
this was a animation that I made with my

147
00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:17,080
baby when she was a couple months old

148
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:19,510
and I noticed that when i left the room

149
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:21,430
she would be in a different position

150
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:23,200
when i came back and she moved really

151
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:27,750
slowly but so i made a stop motion

152
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:30,840
application are a time-lapse application

153
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:35,920
here so i can show how how easy that

154
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:39,210
would be so i have a camera module and

155
00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:46,360
an animation module and i'll use a

156
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,280
countdown and and there are different

157
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:55,300
ways of doing this allow camera so this

158
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:59,000
is the get user media camera

159
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,230
I'll just leave the duration at three

160
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:07,529
seconds and so every 33 seconds then at

161
00:09:07,529 --> 00:09:10,769
the countdown will tell the camera to

162
00:09:10,769 --> 00:09:14,070
send send an image and then I'll touch

163
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:16,620
that to the animation which is just a

164
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:20,579
collection of those images and once i

165
00:09:20,579 --> 00:09:22,980
have a few that it'll start to make an

166
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:26,610
animation so i explained with stop

167
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:29,820
motion first but then when I had that

168
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:31,529
question like what is she doing when I'm

169
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:33,990
out of the room I was able to just add

170
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:37,019
this another module and and then like

171
00:09:37,019 --> 00:09:48,269
see this time-lapse view of her this was

172
00:09:48,269 --> 00:09:50,370
my introduction to media creation

173
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:54,510
digital media creation and if anybody

174
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:57,360
recognizes that the kinetics quick can

175
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:01,250
it plugged into the printer port and

176
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:04,020
whatever that is for for power from the

177
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:08,670
keyboard and it was really it was really

178
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:10,110
kind of clergy to put all these pieces

179
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:11,940
together like I wanted to make

180
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:15,779
animations of Legos and Plato and I

181
00:10:15,779 --> 00:10:18,060
figured it out but I had to use a lot of

182
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:20,970
different tools in the same way that my

183
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:22,410
grandpa did like tools that weren't

184
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:24,540
designed for stop-motion but putting

185
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:27,180
them together and figuring them out so

186
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:32,490
they could be that so my hope is that if

187
00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:35,420
somebody's looking for stop motion or

188
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:40,050
four for whatever whatever problem

189
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:41,850
they're trying to solve if I can find

190
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:46,020
this kind of system and see an app that

191
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,579
somebody's already made to solve the

192
00:10:47,579 --> 00:10:49,770
problem if it doesn't quite solve it and

193
00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:51,180
they can open it up and change how it

194
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:55,649
works so I I want to design to give

195
00:10:55,649 --> 00:11:00,979
everybody that

196
00:11:00,989 --> 00:11:04,720
demos I started talk from a designer

197
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,749
that does really cool generative stuff

198
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:10,540
using processing making us svgs but he

199
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:13,269
showed his process for extracting a

200
00:11:13,269 --> 00:11:16,720
color palette from an image which is

201
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,879
nice you can use that to make generative

202
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:20,350
stuff so the image in the background

203
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:24,399
here was was generated from the colors

204
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:28,509
in this image and his process involved

205
00:11:28,509 --> 00:11:32,579
going into Photoshop and exporting to

206
00:11:32,579 --> 00:11:36,399
jiff and reducing the colors and then

207
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:39,509
somehow getting that colors out of there

208
00:11:39,509 --> 00:11:42,309
so as he was explaining this process I

209
00:11:42,309 --> 00:11:43,989
was thinking I could just put this into

210
00:11:43,989 --> 00:11:45,910
one module and then any time that I

211
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:48,850
wanted to do that I could I could do

212
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:50,860
that in the same the same kind of flow

213
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:53,499
and get however many colors I want from

214
00:11:53,499 --> 00:11:58,959
the image i made this eyeball at our

215
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:05,259
hack day in Stockholm and it took more

216
00:12:05,259 --> 00:12:07,660
time to blow up the balloon then to make

217
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:10,720
the visualization to wire together the

218
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,809
visualization that's not actually true

219
00:12:13,809 --> 00:12:17,709
but I was I started artak day if you've

220
00:12:17,709 --> 00:12:19,029
never done that I highly recommend it

221
00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:22,059
it's a great way to to work on something

222
00:12:22,059 --> 00:12:24,100
intensely for three days and then show

223
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:26,410
it in a gallery with a bunch of other

224
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:31,119
crazy stuff but the first couple days I

225
00:12:31,119 --> 00:12:34,809
was working on some eye tracking glasses

226
00:12:34,809 --> 00:12:37,899
and I did my first 3d printing and put

227
00:12:37,899 --> 00:12:40,929
together electronics and I was trying to

228
00:12:40,929 --> 00:12:42,759
get it to work and then just realized

229
00:12:42,759 --> 00:12:45,220
that it wasn't going to work so I had

230
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:47,919
one day to put this together and I found

231
00:12:47,919 --> 00:12:49,240
the balloon and wired together the

232
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:53,259
animation and I don't think like

233
00:12:53,259 --> 00:12:54,610
obviously there's a lot of work that

234
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:56,589
that I went into making all those

235
00:12:56,589 --> 00:12:58,329
components but then actually putting

236
00:12:58,329 --> 00:13:00,360
them together took very little time

237
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,529
compared to what it would take if I was

238
00:13:02,529 --> 00:13:06,050
starting with text an empty text editor

239
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:10,830
and I want to start to wrap wrap up with

240
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:14,970
this quote from Howard Rheingold it's

241
00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:16,230
important that we realized today that

242
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:17,820
those skills of tomorrow will have

243
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:19,770
little to do with how we operate

244
00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:21,840
computers and a great deal to do with

245
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:24,810
how to use augmented intellects enhance

246
00:13:24,810 --> 00:13:26,940
communications and amplified

247
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:29,850
imaginations and I would add just not

248
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:32,280
just operate computers but also program

249
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:34,440
computers like it doesn't matter so much

250
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,270
how we how we r programming these things

251
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:39,600
but if we can make it easier and to take

252
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,000
things apart see how they work and put

253
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
them back together I think that that

254
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,550
will help with the amplified

255
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:51,660
imaginations part of this I think I

256
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:55,140
think we're that quote is from 94 and I

257
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:57,840
think that we're far enough into the age

258
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:00,510
of Google and Facebook to have some idea

259
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:05,280
of of augmented intellects and it has

260
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:07,620
communications like what what there's

261
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:15,800
actually being in progress and yeah so I

262
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:18,180
want to see how how that's going to work

263
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:21,870
for amplified imaginations as well and

264
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:27,600
seeing more people programming so where

265
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,100
to go from here I have a lot of ideas

266
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:34,020
from from working with visual

267
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:36,360
programming for a while I've been

268
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:39,180
imagining what it could be if if we

269
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:41,610
could actually arrange these modules in

270
00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:43,620
space and do kind of some kind of

271
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:46,880
spatial programming so I think like

272
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:50,160
creating design mockups and I'm playing

273
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,680
with with those possibilities or is

274
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:55,950
going to be a lot of fun but but

275
00:14:55,950 --> 00:14:58,800
obviously for now I hope that more

276
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,640
people start using this and start making

277
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:04,410
reusable components I think custom

278
00:15:04,410 --> 00:15:07,040
elements is a great way to do this and

279
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,750
and I want to build that into this

280
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:12,240
system where any custom component you

281
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,670
can put it in it'll automatically you

282
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:16,310
can wire stuff up to us

283
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:24,470
to its event tooth messages and and I've

284
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:27,440
joined up with a team to make this into

285
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:31,010
a into a company we have a Kickstarter

286
00:15:31,010 --> 00:15:33,860
it's actually closing in about 10 hours

287
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:38,779
now and so we've passed our goal which

288
00:15:38,779 --> 00:15:40,670
is great so I'm not hitting you up for

289
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:43,070
money but I'm hitting you up for four

290
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:45,830
brains and I'm really interested to to

291
00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:47,930
work with the JavaScript community and

292
00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:52,120
and see where we can take this idea and

293
00:15:52,120 --> 00:16:05,740
that's that's about it

294
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:08,010
alright well we'll do questions since

295
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:13,200
it's the last social so that was really

296
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:16,020
neat um I didn't know that that was like

297
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:17,610
dataflow programming was what you called

298
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:21,780
that um so isn't is Alice at dataflow

299
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:24,780
programming thing like the Alice ID I

300
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:26,880
haven't used them okay it's like a thing

301
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,260
that they use to teach kids programming

302
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:29,940
it's pretty cool like also like the lego

303
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:31,940
robots like the kind of stuff yeah um

304
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:35,460
I've used scratch and scratch it is a

305
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:36,600
different kind of visual programming

306
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:40,800
yeah you snap together bits and scratch

307
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,440
is actually closer to the code then then

308
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:46,530
this kind of stuff because each little

309
00:16:46,530 --> 00:16:48,540
block is is like a line of code

310
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:51,180
basically and it's just an easier way to

311
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:53,910
connect are you don't have to worry

312
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:55,170
about syntax you don't have to worry

313
00:16:55,170 --> 00:16:56,850
about the semicolon when you snap all

314
00:16:56,850 --> 00:17:00,060
those things together but this this kind

315
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:02,790
is different so you could have you could

316
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:03,950
have that kind of visual programming

317
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:06,240
inside one of the components or

318
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,190
something like that or the other way

319
00:17:08,190 --> 00:17:13,980
around but so when you say like creating

320
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:16,320
components like so those ones that you

321
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:18,210
show do those already exist in like the

322
00:17:18,210 --> 00:17:20,010
I like checked out the no flow

323
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:22,200
javascript thing like when you say

324
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,030
people should create more like that

325
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:24,990
would be cool people to create more

326
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:26,580
components like what do you mean by that

327
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:29,850
and like do you think like see more like

328
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:31,140
artists using this kind of like how

329
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:34,320
people use openframeworks or like like

330
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:38,130
like who do you want to reach um that's

331
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:40,830
that's where I came out it from my

332
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:44,760
thesis side that my thesis is at me Bo

333
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:47,490
RG so there you can see all the

334
00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:51,510
components that I have for me boo and no

335
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:54,990
flow is actually it's kind of a fork i

336
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:59,840
have i have another version but no fluke

337
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:03,810
no sorry no flow started with nodejs and

338
00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:06,960
that's why it's called no foe and it's

339
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:10,200
it's lower level programming so I kind

340
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,970
of came at it from the

341
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:14,590
user interface of putting these things

342
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:17,110
together and also like the things that I

343
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:19,000
wanted to play with with images and

344
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,520
stuff and no flow has come from lower

345
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:24,340
level closer to Java JavaScript and more

346
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:30,490
nodejs kind of things so Henry who

347
00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:32,950
started the no flow project rewrote

348
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:35,730
Jekyll and no flow so you can use that

349
00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:41,020
you can use Jekyll and you're no DJ s

350
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:45,040
apps without without using Ruby which

351
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:47,470
which is pretty great and and the graph

352
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:50,080
for Jekyll is a lot easier to understand

353
00:18:50,080 --> 00:19:00,080
than sixteen thousand lines of Ruby code

354
00:19:00,090 --> 00:19:02,909
you

355
00:19:02,919 --> 00:19:04,929
can you can you show an implementation

356
00:19:04,929 --> 00:19:13,929
of a component yes so so all of them and

357
00:19:13,929 --> 00:19:18,700
the interface have this cog icon that

358
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:25,109
should link directly to the source so

359
00:19:25,109 --> 00:19:29,019
the API I came up with is relatively

360
00:19:29,019 --> 00:19:32,830
simple so all these input matte input

361
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:36,519
fill these are things that happen when

362
00:19:36,519 --> 00:19:42,070
you get data from somewhere else so for

363
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:45,609
example when you input the fill on the

364
00:19:45,609 --> 00:19:49,359
on the circle then you get a color and

365
00:19:49,359 --> 00:19:53,470
then you set the this context fill style

366
00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:56,679
to that color so that's the that's the

367
00:19:56,679 --> 00:19:59,769
basic interface of what you do when you

368
00:19:59,769 --> 00:20:02,080
get data to define the inputs and

369
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:07,749
outputs I have this this kind of thing

370
00:20:07,749 --> 00:20:09,369
so this one has a bunch of inputs but

371
00:20:09,369 --> 00:20:13,139
but basically the inputs can have a type

372
00:20:13,139 --> 00:20:18,159
and yeah the outputs as well and that

373
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:21,899
helps in the interface when you start to

374
00:20:21,899 --> 00:20:28,040
drag let's see where can I get a color

375
00:20:28,050 --> 00:20:31,740
so here you have a hsla color generation

376
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:34,290
we start to drag from there you see up

377
00:20:34,290 --> 00:20:36,240
here it'll highlight the ones that make

378
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,070
sense to connect to so that's all that

379
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:41,580
types do in mimo is kind of give you

380
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:44,760
some indication in the UI where where

381
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:47,850
that data is going to make sense so when

382
00:20:47,850 --> 00:20:50,570
you connect that then you get the color

383
00:20:50,570 --> 00:20:54,960
then there there are some UI elements

384
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:58,770
like sliders and most of the UI stuff is

385
00:20:58,770 --> 00:21:01,380
normalized from 120 or I tried to do

386
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:03,780
that as much as possible so that that

387
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:07,310
when you move those sliders than you

388
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:10,560
yeah that it the data flows through and

389
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:13,710
you get to get your color and I'm going

390
00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:15,660
to be doing some djing tonight that

391
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:18,960
that's the VJ part is going to be an 830

392
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:23,250
in the party here so a 30 to 10 maybe so

393
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:24,960
feel free to come up and talk with me I

394
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,450
might be up here but you can come up and

395
00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:32,410
I can show you what's going on and yeah

396
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:36,870
um over here yeah yeah so this looks

397
00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:40,200
really cool so one thing I always think

398
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,940
was stuff like this is one of the

399
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:44,580
problems with these kind of components

400
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:46,770
is that was software we're always using

401
00:21:46,770 --> 00:21:49,140
api's which are actually very brittle

402
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:51,600
right and so components you can only use

403
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:52,800
components that were explicitly

404
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:55,830
explicitly written for this system and

405
00:21:55,830 --> 00:21:58,020
you know everyone has their own system

406
00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:00,900
and a different way of having modules so

407
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:02,460
I'm wondering have you have you at all

408
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:04,370
looked into ways that we can actually

409
00:22:04,370 --> 00:22:08,100
kind of make loser couple two interfaces

410
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:10,770
between software components and possibly

411
00:22:10,770 --> 00:22:13,800
make it easier to to incorporate

412
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:14,670
components that weren't actually

413
00:22:14,670 --> 00:22:16,980
designed for a particular system if you

414
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:20,070
know what I mean yeah you know like with

415
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:22,080
components is like you know if you don't

416
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,520
know the right name the right function

417
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,750
to call or whatever you're you're

418
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:27,730
you can't actually connect two things

419
00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:30,190
together right and I wonder if we get

420
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:32,380
make things more like the physical world

421
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:35,830
in some way in that two things don't

422
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:37,630
have to be designed together to be able

423
00:22:37,630 --> 00:22:40,450
to work together yeah I think I think

424
00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:44,320
Mozilla polymer project and Mozilla sex

425
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:48,930
tags and Google's polymer project are

426
00:22:48,930 --> 00:22:53,020
they're both exploring these HTML custom

427
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:56,020
elements I think that that's that's

428
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:59,620
going to be a really good thing for this

429
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:01,990
like all of these all these could be

430
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:04,210
custom elements and then if you didn't

431
00:23:04,210 --> 00:23:05,650
want to use this interface you could

432
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:09,670
just make a V slider tag circle tag and

433
00:23:09,670 --> 00:23:12,460
then you get the canvas out of that or

434
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:16,000
whatever so I hope that that's going to

435
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:21,820
help with that problem but yeah and

436
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:23,470
making making these components I've used

437
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:25,270
a lot of different libraries and kind of

438
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:29,890
wrapped them in in my own thing that is

439
00:23:29,890 --> 00:23:31,420
normalizes the inputs and the outputs

440
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:35,440
and if there's some kind of standard for

441
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:38,700
that like that custom elements could

442
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:42,850
could could tell you or tell the page

443
00:23:42,850 --> 00:23:45,310
like what are the inputs and what are

444
00:23:45,310 --> 00:23:48,400
the outputs I think I think that that

445
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,740
would be cool

446
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:57,830
hello hi hi so I once upon a time worked

447
00:23:57,830 --> 00:24:00,770
on a really large LabVIEW project which

448
00:24:00,770 --> 00:24:03,230
is pretty similar to this although I

449
00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:05,570
didn't know that it had a name in a

450
00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:08,090
problem that I ran into was it was very

451
00:24:08,090 --> 00:24:10,640
difficult for me to like rock what

452
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:13,040
anything was doing at any time sometimes

453
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,360
there would be like cool animations that

454
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:16,160
would show me timers going off and that

455
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:20,660
sort of thing but to to understand like

456
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:21,800
if there was a bug or anything like that

457
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,780
I would have to click on a component and

458
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:25,910
then like click for five minutes like

459
00:24:25,910 --> 00:24:27,710
drilling down into components to figure

460
00:24:27,710 --> 00:24:29,900
out what was happening and i found that

461
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:31,460
was an instance where the visual

462
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:34,160
metaphor impeded my progress as opposed

463
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,510
to a text version where i could have

464
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:38,090
just like grep for a thing do you know

465
00:24:38,090 --> 00:24:40,010
what I mean is there an equivalent to

466
00:24:40,010 --> 00:24:44,390
like prepping for a thing in in this or

467
00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:45,590
like is there an equivalent of like a

468
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:47,870
stack trace that I could look at so i

469
00:24:47,870 --> 00:24:53,390
can debug faster um well so this this is

470
00:24:53,390 --> 00:24:57,020
more of the toy implementation and then

471
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:59,270
with with no flow where we're hoping to

472
00:24:59,270 --> 00:25:01,810
expand it to more serious programming

473
00:25:01,810 --> 00:25:05,390
and we're thinking of a lot of ways to

474
00:25:05,390 --> 00:25:10,580
to to make it work like that or but I

475
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:11,840
don't know exactly how it's going to end

476
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:13,430
up but it's going to be a process of us

477
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:15,710
I was making it and using it and

478
00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:18,980
figuring things out like one thing that

479
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:21,260
I thought would be nice in a running

480
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:24,020
graph is like to click on any wire and

481
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:25,730
then see the data going through that

482
00:25:25,730 --> 00:25:28,100
wire kind of instead of going back to

483
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:30,950
the code and making a debugger call or

484
00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:32,840
like or putting in a breakpoint or

485
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:36,110
something just just clicking on a wire

486
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:38,930
and seeing what's going to there but

487
00:25:38,930 --> 00:25:40,730
yeah obviously when you start to get

488
00:25:40,730 --> 00:25:43,130
components inside of components then

489
00:25:43,130 --> 00:25:44,690
like digging through those and figure

490
00:25:44,690 --> 00:25:49,280
out where things are changing like it's

491
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:51,080
going to require it's going to be some

492
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:51,890
kind of

493
00:25:51,890 --> 00:25:54,080
design that's going to have to we're

494
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:57,100
going to have to figure it out as we go

495
00:25:57,100 --> 00:26:03,050
are we done well no we're not we do have

496
00:26:03,050 --> 00:26:09,920
time for one more I wanted to say thank

497
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,720
you because I work with kids and I teach

498
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:13,040
them how to code and I'm definitely

499
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:15,890
going to use this it's awesome and I

500
00:26:15,890 --> 00:26:19,070
wanted to ask you how do you embed we

501
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:22,460
mixing into the design of your tool like

502
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:24,980
can people for color people projects or

503
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:27,380
do you have a library or a package where

504
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:30,020
you can get certain collections of

505
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:32,630
combinations and if you thought about

506
00:26:32,630 --> 00:26:36,590
somehow integrating markdown as well and

507
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:43,400
yeah thanks um so will you if you have a

508
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:45,200
graph that you like and you want to save

509
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,960
it you can save you can save it to just

510
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:51,410
with with that button then you get a

511
00:26:51,410 --> 00:26:54,740
link to it immediately so I don't have I

512
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:57,080
don't have anything thats collecting all

513
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:59,810
these but but I'm kind of watching

514
00:26:59,810 --> 00:27:02,090
online to see if to see what people are

515
00:27:02,090 --> 00:27:05,000
making and some interesting things are

516
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,720
happening in tumblr now with it so so

517
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,910
that's one thing like sharing sharing

518
00:27:10,910 --> 00:27:14,900
yourself is really easy and if you make

519
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:16,910
if you make a graph that you like and

520
00:27:16,910 --> 00:27:18,410
you share it and then somebody else

521
00:27:18,410 --> 00:27:22,670
opens it and saves it you can you can

522
00:27:22,670 --> 00:27:26,690
load them as a sub graph so this was a

523
00:27:26,690 --> 00:27:29,170
graph that I made earlier and I just

524
00:27:29,170 --> 00:27:32,030
loaded it as a sub graph I don't have

525
00:27:32,030 --> 00:27:34,460
any inputs and outputs defined in this

526
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:37,700
one but but yeah that's the idea that

527
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:40,190
you can take somebody else's graph and

528
00:27:40,190 --> 00:27:43,730
put it into yours and define some some

529
00:27:43,730 --> 00:27:48,430
outputs there

530
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:52,860
yeah and so I I have some resources on

531
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:57,360
the website and hopefully we'll continue

532
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,760
to add them but but this is the main

533
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:03,600
page where for ideas I have this this

534
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:08,160
activity for for making us physical kind

535
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:13,700
of 3d animation thing so you have the

536
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:16,430
like the basic instructions are here and

537
00:28:16,430 --> 00:28:19,820
added some illustrations and then I

538
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:22,320
embedded the app itself here so you

539
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,180
could you could read this and then like

540
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:27,120
use the app on the same page there so

541
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:30,480
this is just an iframe but but I think

542
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,820
that there will be where I'm hoping to

543
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:35,370
make more like better ways of of kind of

544
00:28:35,370 --> 00:28:39,820
packaging these things and sharing them

545
00:28:39,830 --> 00:28:53,330
cool thank you very much those amazing
