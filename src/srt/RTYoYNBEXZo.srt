00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:22,990

my name is Jennifer dewalt I am

2
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:25,510
from San Francisco and I taught myself

3
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:27,939
to code by making 180 websites at 180

4
00:00:27,939 --> 00:00:34,310
days

5
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,680
hi my name is jay sean moments i'm from

6
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,950
brazil my talk with about year six you

7
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:43,559
can now have separated modules in

8
00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:46,559
javascript and have arrow functions that

9
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:48,870
similar to lambda in another language

10
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:51,780
and fix a lot of issues that we already

11
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:59,060
have it bugs me

12
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:03,090
my name is special mark page I live in

13
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:06,390
San Francisco working for facebook so my

14
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:09,810
talk was about how we a job Polly fills

15
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:12,290
as a way to job in the language pictures

16
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:16,110
but for these standards even finalized

17
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:18,750
before it's implemented in browsers so

18
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:22,860
that we as a community can unify on a

19
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:25,590
single set of tools instead of diverging

20
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:28,560
libraries my talk was about parallax and

21
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,369
you strain in one design that means that

22
00:01:32,369 --> 00:01:35,729
after user Scrolls we move as far up and

23
00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:38,009
down the website and it gives the

24
00:01:38,009 --> 00:01:40,229
sensation of perspective to the user

25
00:01:40,229 --> 00:01:42,869
we're seeing that transcript is kind of

26
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:46,020
permeating everywhere from hardware to

27
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:51,509
robots to filter reality so I think the

28
00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:54,660
web will keep being this thing that

29
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:57,179
connects us all and the core of it will

30
00:01:57,179 --> 00:01:59,250
be the web platform things are we

31
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:10,440
working on today

32
00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:13,330
you

33
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:14,660
for the last few months have been

34
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:18,019
working on virtual reality like Google

35
00:02:18,019 --> 00:02:20,360
cardboard headsets and also like up

36
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,340
loose absolutely ethics I think I'm

37
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:24,530
making like trying to make like easy

38
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:26,480
interface for people to work on it and

39
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,730
also like a 3d audio like interfacing

40
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:32,000
with a Web Audio API and I had to make

41
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,319
it easier for people to like create all

42
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:34,549
those pretty walls and like to

43
00:02:34,549 --> 00:02:35,780
experiment with it if you look at the

44
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:38,420
history of JavaScript over the last many

45
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:40,700
years it's still the case that

46
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:43,220
essentially with every year the new

47
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:45,410
tools and the new technology is

48
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:47,030
available in JavaScript and through

49
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:49,940
JavaScript are accelerating there's more

50
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:51,500
more things we can do with JavaScript

51
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,239
and we are also seeing a very healthy

52
00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:54,860
addition of new language features

53
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:56,630
through sanitization and we are very

54
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:59,379
excited about that I talked here about

55
00:02:59,379 --> 00:03:02,750
j2me jas which is a Java Virtual Machine

56
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:05,599
written in JavaScript we're using this

57
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:07,549
Java VM to run feature phone

58
00:03:07,549 --> 00:03:10,940
applications on Firefox OS think there

59
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:12,140
are a few interesting trends in

60
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:13,940
technology over the past couple of years

61
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:15,560
and you're only going to see more of it

62
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:19,250
one is the entire software little Bluff

63
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:21,739
landscape getting more polyglot because

64
00:03:21,739 --> 00:03:22,910
using more languages and more

65
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:25,340
technologies over time one interesting

66
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:27,260
thing I noticed in of 0 is how many

67
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:28,880
external systems you are using to

68
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:31,329
deliver our service it's about 50

69
00:03:31,329 --> 00:03:32,990
external component

70
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:35,000
so software development going forward I

71
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,620
think will be mostly about putting

72
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:38,720
together existing building blocks and

73
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,330
gluing them together rather than huge

74
00:03:41,330 --> 00:04:02,240
infrastructure investments

75
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:06,400
the future of javascript is it's still

76
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,470
being used more and more it's being

77
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:10,840
adopted by more programmers being used

78
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:13,300
in more programming domains it was

79
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:15,010
always in the browser because it got out

80
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:17,110
first when i was at Netscape before

81
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:19,480
Microsoft could make vbscript be the

82
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:22,540
single one and then it got into the

83
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:24,850
server side several times but the one

84
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:26,800
that really succeeded was node J s

85
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,090
nodejs is used all over now and

86
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:31,990
javascripts also been used in the

87
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:34,120
internet of things as well like the

88
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:37,390
tehsil system-on-a-chip engine of things
