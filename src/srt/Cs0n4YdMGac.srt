my name is Alex Sexton i just presented

2
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:17,400
on building your own component library

3
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:20,610
I'm from Austin Texas and I am an

4
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:23,210
engineered stripe that payments company

5
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:26,540
a lot of my job focuses around

6
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:28,680
JavaScript development and front-end

7
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:31,410
development but I'm also very active in

8
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:33,750
the open source community which is where

9
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:35,730
I really got into JavaScript I helped

10
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:37,590
with the jQuery foundation and the dojo

11
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:40,440
foundation and I really enjoy open

12
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,480
source in general I'm really excited

13
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,789
about where the web is going and where

14
00:00:44,789 --> 00:00:46,949
javascript is going definitely a

15
00:00:46,949 --> 00:00:50,190
ubiquitous language that that people are

16
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:53,879
still coming around to but is is really

17
00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:55,649
I mean they don't really have a choice

18
00:00:55,649 --> 00:00:58,800
either way because of its ubiquity but I

19
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,780
think it will really stand up to the

20
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:02,850
test of time with things like azum and

21
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:05,880
things that will really help push the

22
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:11,380
JavaScript performance view into

23
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:13,760
competition with things like native

24
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:17,030
which I think it already can do but in

25
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:20,180
the future should be the web winning

26
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:23,810
again case I've really enjoyed Buenos

27
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:29,180
Aires so far I've had from Texas and so

28
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:33,229
the meat situation is correct here and

29
00:01:33,229 --> 00:01:35,479
I've enjoyed all the food very much so

30
00:01:35,479 --> 00:01:37,160
far but also feels like a very friendly

31
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:41,300
city I visit cities often I feel like an

32
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:43,460
outsider and I definitely feel welcome

33
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:46,790
and comfortable walking through the

34
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:48,890
streets here and that's something that

35
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:52,250
that not every city can say she has comp

36
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:55,660
Argentina is definitely one of the best

37
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:58,280
JavaScript conferences but I think I've

38
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:01,220
been to quite a few j/s comps in

39
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:03,229
particular and this is definitely up

40
00:02:03,229 --> 00:02:05,180
there with the best of them the food and

41
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:09,110
the projectors are crazy Guillermo is

42
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:11,840
crazy I really really have been having a
