1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:31,169
Everybody should have their owm theme music.

2
00:00:31,169 --> 00:00:34,860
Hello everyone!

3
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:36,110


4
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:37,110
Alright!

5
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:44,020
If you don't follow me on Twitter you should
know it is not going to be a quite room.

6
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:46,190
Welcome to unintended consequences.

7
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:51,710
How ro reduce exclusionary practices in our
organizations and communities.

8
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:55,170
I am Kim Crayton.

9
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:57,600
You can use the hashtag #causeascene.

10
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,600
You can find me @KimCrayton1.

11
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:05,390
I have a website hashtagcauseascene.com as
well as kimcrayton.com.

12
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:11,560
After this I usually would put my credentials
in there, but you know what, I'm causing such

13
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:14,970
a scene, I don't care if you don't trust what
I have to say.

14
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:16,659
I know what I'm talking about.

15
00:01:16,659 --> 00:01:18,490
So, there it is.

16
00:01:18,490 --> 00:01:22,299
First, and also, there it is.

17
00:01:22,299 --> 00:01:26,039
So, let's define some terms.

18
00:01:26,039 --> 00:01:29,200
I am an educator by trade.

19
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,590
I entered tech four years ago.

20
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:36,409
I like to start everybody on the same page.

21
00:01:36,409 --> 00:01:42,030
So that, when I get into my talk, people are
saying, yeah, I don't know what that means,

22
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:46,209
so we just start off everybody in the same
place.

23
00:01:46,209 --> 00:01:49,140
Privilege is about access.

24
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:52,359
When I talk about privilege, I don't just
talk about race, and gender and all these

25
00:01:52,359 --> 00:01:57,869
things, I talk about access, that means there
is a group of people who have more access

26
00:01:57,869 --> 00:02:03,710
to resource s, connections, than other groups.

27
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:05,560
That's what privilege is.

28
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,560
It's that simple.

29
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,560
It's about access.

30
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:12,080
So I use this picture, because everybody,
people have seen these monkeys in Japan thinking

31
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,269
that's so cute.

32
00:02:13,269 --> 00:02:19,459
What is there is an example of access, because
there's a family of female family group that

33
00:02:19,459 --> 00:02:23,970
is only — they are the only ones who get
in the water.

34
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:26,849
The other monkeys on the outside, they've
got to fend for themselves.

35
00:02:26,849 --> 00:02:29,189
If they freeze to death, they only freeze
to death.

36
00:02:29,189 --> 00:02:31,370
It's only a family of monkeys that can get
in.

37
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:38,200
So this family has access to this pool of
hot water where others don't.

38
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,549
Under-represented is about numbers.

39
00:02:40,549 --> 00:02:41,650
That's all it's.

40
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:48,390
In tech, white women are under represented.

41
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:50,040
Marginalised is about treatment.

42
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:57,000
In tech, many white women are not marginalised,
so I like to make that distinction because,

43
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:03,409
when people say they want diversity, adding
a white woman to your team, or to your panel,

44
00:03:03,409 --> 00:03:09,189
is not diversity.

45
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:10,819
Diversity is about variety.

46
00:03:10,819 --> 00:03:14,269
I know I'm from the States, and we have Crayola
crayons.

47
00:03:14,269 --> 00:03:15,650
When you get that big box.

48
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:20,799
When I was a child, I got 64 crayons as an
own child.

49
00:03:20,799 --> 00:03:24,420
That's what variety and diversity about.

50
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:27,370
Inclusion is the Holy Grail.

51
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:29,519
It is about experience.

52
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:34,950
It is about everyone having the experience
they expect when they come in contact with

53
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:40,650
your business, your community, or your event.

54
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:46,569
Inclusion is not about equity, because if
you white man and I, black woman from the

55
00:03:46,569 --> 00:03:51,989
south of the United States, start the race
at the same time, you're still going to be

56
00:03:51,989 --> 00:03:52,989
ahead of me.

57
00:03:52,989 --> 00:04:00,120
I need you to stop, sit down for a second,
and let me catch up, and pass you!

58
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:04,519
Inclusion is not about quotas.

59
00:04:04,519 --> 00:04:07,280
That's under representation.

60
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:12,609
Inclusion is about people's experiences with
your companies, your communities, and your

61
00:04:12,609 --> 00:04:16,079
events.

62
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:19,590
So we're going to talk about some businesses
here, and these are some of the things that

63
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:25,990
get — that I find that get individuals in
trouble or get them in places you don't want

64
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:31,010
to be with these unintended consequences because
many people think they have a business when,

65
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:33,690
in fact, they have a product or a service.

66
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:36,440
A product or a service is not a business.

67
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:42,720
A business requires processes, policies, and
procedures that allow you to grow, scale,

68
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:47,680
recover, but for the fact that you have created
a product or service, you do not necessarily

69
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,680
have a business.

70
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:52,370
That's why BC can come in and take your company
because they bring in those scales that help

71
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:56,030
you grow and everything else.

72
00:04:56,030 --> 00:05:00,420
And I blame the lean canvas model for this
because that is about iterating a product

73
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:03,690
or a service and not about a business.

74
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:07,990
Also, you cannot manage what you do not measure.

75
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:09,220
You can't.

76
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:11,110
You can get.

77
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:15,650
But you will never know where you are exactly
if you can manage it — you cannot manage

78
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:17,780
it if you cannot measure.

79
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:18,780
It.

80
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:22,000
I'm not a person who reads up these things.

81
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,900
These things appeared, because I don't remember
why, I ad lib a lot.

82
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:31,539
All too often, organisations fail, and, when
I say organisations, I mean businesses and

83
00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:32,539
communities.

84
00:05:32,539 --> 00:05:33,539
I'm going to make that one thing.

85
00:05:33,539 --> 00:05:38,069
When I'm talking about organisations, that's
what I'm talking about, because, or become

86
00:05:38,069 --> 00:05:43,819
toxic, because the leaders don't understand
that growth requires processes that enable

87
00:05:43,819 --> 00:05:47,900
connectedness, innovation, and competitive
advantage.

88
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:51,870
What happens is you have a group of — we're
going to talk about white man because that's

89
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:53,169
what we are full of.

90
00:05:53,169 --> 00:05:58,410
You have a group of white men who go to university,
who come up with this project, and this is

91
00:05:58,410 --> 00:05:59,410
great.

92
00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:01,970
Let's do this to make money.

93
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:06,949
They step over here with the same intelligent
hat when they're in their frat.

94
00:06:06,949 --> 00:06:10,419
They have not thought about business being
different.

95
00:06:10,419 --> 00:06:13,360
So they behave the same way.

96
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:17,770
They stay up the same amount of hours they
used to — that's why you have these Ping-Pong

97
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:21,922
tables — they have women and marginalised
groups, we couldn't care less about all that

98
00:06:21,922 --> 00:06:26,860
— I'm going home — I don't even know how
to play Ping-Pong, I can't even keep it on

99
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:29,379
the table!

100
00:06:29,379 --> 00:06:33,160
We don't — I'm not interested in drinking
beer with you on the job.

101
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:38,110
I want to do my job, and I want to go home.

102
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:43,849
Successful organisations are built on foundations
that enable their leaders to turn information

103
00:06:43,849 --> 00:06:47,780
into knowledge in order to scale, evolve,
and recover.

104
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:48,990
That's what a business is.

105
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:55,819
If you can't scale it, if you can't recover,
or if you can't evolve, what you created for

106
00:06:55,819 --> 00:06:58,040
yourself is a job.

107
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:01,920
It's not a business.

108
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:05,479
So you see people who work at restaurants,
and they can't ever leave.

109
00:07:05,479 --> 00:07:06,479
They have to be there all day.

110
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:07,800
That's a job.

111
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,710
They created a job for themselves.

112
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:14,110
You want to be able to to work on your business
and not work in your business.

113
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:22,229
And so, is it we all know, being technologists,
Google has everything.

114
00:07:22,229 --> 00:07:26,590
But just because you could find information
on Google does not mean it's knowledge for

115
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:27,590
you.

116
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:31,440
You have to do something to internalise that
information before it becomes knowledge, so

117
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:35,009
it's a lived experience.

118
00:07:35,009 --> 00:07:37,470
That's one point they're missing.

119
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:43,630
The ability for organisation leads to successfully
create and manage operations relies heavily

120
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:48,039
on how well they are there are available and
necessary processes.

121
00:07:48,039 --> 00:07:52,439
Here, we talked about that you have to have
the information that turns in the knowledge

122
00:07:52,439 --> 00:08:01,139
that will allow you to scale, evolve, and
to recover, then you need to have the acumen,

123
00:08:01,139 --> 00:08:06,520
the ability, to put those processes in place
to allow you to evolve, scale, recover.

124
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:13,069
I'm going to be honest with you: many of you
don't have these.

125
00:08:13,069 --> 00:08:14,949
Many of you are developers.

126
00:08:14,949 --> 00:08:18,720
Many of you don't care to learn anything else.

127
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:23,990
Like I say at many of my talks, if you don't
have these human-centric skills, you will

128
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:27,200
be out of a job soon, and you will be one
or the other.

129
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:34,219
I, on the other hand, who has a different
set of technical skills, you have technology

130
00:08:34,219 --> 00:08:39,180
skills, I have a different set of skills,
I hate when they call my skills soft because

131
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:45,490
many don't have them, I am a person who can
deal with human beings, I will always have

132
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:47,740
a job.

133
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:51,240
You need to start thinking about that.

134
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:56,880
When leaders take the time to understand and
operationalise — this is a key word — operationalise

135
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:02,320
their organisation's functions, they avoid
common barriers to success while being able

136
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:06,370
to recover more quickly from unexpected events.

137
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:07,639
Unexpected events are going to happen.

138
00:09:07,639 --> 00:09:13,490
As the first speaker talked about airs, we
know that's not in our code.

139
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:14,560
When you're building a business.

140
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:17,300
You're testing stuff out.

141
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:24,090
You think you have it, and there is your site's
down, or your accountant ran off with your

142
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:25,610
money — whatever it is.

143
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:28,930
There will be unexpected events.

144
00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:33,450
Having these things in place allows you to
prepare at least for some of that.

145
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:36,150
Many businesses have no plans in place.

146
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:40,780
They're just going on, and whatever happens,
happens, and then they're just like, "I don't

147
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:41,780
know."

148
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:45,670
"I don't know why Cambridge Analytica has
our data.

149
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:50,370
I don't know why we didn't go back after four
years and did somebody check and see if they

150
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:51,700
destroyed that?"

151
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:59,120
I don't know all these things, because there
are processes in place.

152
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:04,160
Building a successful organisation with fewer
unintended consequences requires more than

153
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:10,610
a great product to serve — again, a product
— it requires leaders being able to give

154
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:15,940
all stakeholders — all stakeholders — the
experiences they want and the ability is to

155
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:17,230
manage a process.

156
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:18,470
This is where inclusion comes.

157
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:21,990
It's about experiences, and I'm going to tell
you what stakeholders I'm talking about in

158
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:25,120
just a moment.

159
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:31,610
I would like to talk to leaders because I
have nothing against people who are not in

160
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:37,510
leadership, but you have absolutely no power,
no agency, no resources, and you cannot move

161
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:42,160
these things forward, and what you do is you
become burnt out.

162
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:46,000
You become frustrated, because they are telling
you at the top that these things are important

163
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,630
to you but they're not giving you any resources
or backing so that you can do anything with

164
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:53,910
it, so you're banging your head against the
ceiling, and they're telling you are doing

165
00:10:53,910 --> 00:11:01,889
such a great job but you feel guilty, I'm
tired, I want to be more inclusive — this

166
00:11:01,889 --> 00:11:06,610
has to come from leadership.

167
00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:12,340
When I talk about all stakeholders, I believe
building businesses for social change.

168
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:16,780
We are in a time where everybody has access
to information.

169
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:21,779
We are at a time where pretty — a lot of
people are very polarised.

170
00:11:21,779 --> 00:11:24,820
And I can speak from the United States.

171
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:29,550
I don't want to make any assumptions about
Germany, but I know our government is not

172
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:33,110
run by politicians, it's run by business owners.

173
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:41,010
It is run by very wealthy business owners
who can pay lobbyists to give money to politicians,

174
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:45,660
and politicians in turn maybe decisions based
on the money they received.

175
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:50,769
So, when we talk about — when I say all
stakeholders, in a traditional business, it

176
00:11:50,769 --> 00:11:52,990
is just about as shareholder.

177
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:57,550
This is what gets me, because people get upset
about jobs leaving.

178
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:02,740
I'm going to give you some business education
if you don't know this.

179
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:09,170
In the United States — again, don't know
about Germany — it is illegal for a board

180
00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:16,420
of directors, or a CEO, their first priority
has to be shareholder value.

181
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:22,680
So, if they do something or make a decision
that would not bring the shareholders as much

182
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:27,279
money as possible, they can be sued by said
shareholders.

183
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:33,690
So, I found ed it — I found it quite interesting
that, during the previous election, all these

184
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:42,800
people — coal jobs are gone, they ain't
bringing them back.

185
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:46,560
The carrier, they thought they were going
— those jobs weren't going to go to Mexico.

186
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:52,500
I don't care who trump is, or who everybody
else is, the shareholders of that company

187
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:59,649
own that company, and the CEO and the board
of directors have to do whatever they can

188
00:12:59,649 --> 00:13:04,720
to make sure that shareholders are not only
not losing money but are increasing their

189
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:05,720
profits.

190
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:08,720
That's what shareholders are about.

191
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:13,070
Stakeholders are looking at other people in
the company, and this is where you get the

192
00:13:13,070 --> 00:13:14,070
inclusiveness.

193
00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:18,440
If you're only thinking about shareholder
value, how inclusive can you actually be?

194
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:24,180
That's why there's no money in it because
you can't justify — there is data about

195
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:29,519
ROI return on investment when you have a very
inclusive teams, and I'm sure if you work

196
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:35,131
on inclusive teams, you know that you have
better ideas, you can create better, you can

197
00:13:35,131 --> 00:13:38,940
create something together that you couldn't
create by yourself, but if your main thing

198
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:45,890
is about shareholder value, if giving something
to inclusion and diversity and those shareholders

199
00:13:45,890 --> 00:13:50,980
don't see an immediate return on their value,
you're not going to get that money.

200
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:53,509
So we're talking about stakeholder values.

201
00:13:53,509 --> 00:13:58,350
This is what the business model I believe
in, and it's talking about considering those

202
00:13:58,350 --> 00:14:05,350
who work for you, those who partner with you,
those who buy from you, and those who invest

203
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:06,350
in you.

204
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:09,100
I have them in that order for a reason.

205
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:14,570
Your employees, the people who work for you
are your most important asset.

206
00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:15,920
Period.

207
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:21,820
They determine how any customer experience
is going to be.

208
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:28,480
So you need to make sure that you have thought
about how to improve the experiences of those

209
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,920
internal stakeholders.

210
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:35,910
And then you're going to go outside a bubble,
and those are your partners, maybe your supply

211
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:41,980
chain, if you're making T-shirts, the company
you choose to make your T-shirts, these are

212
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:47,910
the things that you need to think about because
you might pick a company that has policies

213
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:49,290
that you don't believe in.

214
00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:52,910
But you partner with them because you haven't
thought about these things.

215
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:56,160
Also, who buys from you?

216
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,040
Everybody's not going to buy from you.

217
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:03,140
There are some clients you will not want,
but you can't know that or be able to articulate

218
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:10,560
that well if you have not made these determinations,
or if you haven't thought about these things.

219
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:14,130
Everybody is running out here for this VC
money.

220
00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:23,240
Mail chimp was named — number-one company
for 2017, and they've not taken a bit of venture

221
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:30,091
capital money before before when we talk about
investing, we need to think, when we are talking

222
00:15:30,091 --> 00:15:35,990
about communities, your local JavaScript,
who is investing their time in you?

223
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:37,850
Who is sponsoring you?

224
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:42,140
Those are the four stakeholders you need to
think about.

225
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:48,600
Going from a product to service focus to business-model
focus takes time.

226
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:54,519
You've got to stop expect ing simple solutions
to complex problems.

227
00:15:54,519 --> 00:15:56,430
This is what gets us in trouble.

228
00:15:56,430 --> 00:16:02,560
It takes intention which means I want to do
something, but wanting to do it is not enough.

229
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:06,519
You have to have a strategy in place to make
it happen.

230
00:16:06,519 --> 00:16:12,110
All are necessary in order to innovate, differentiate,
and compete in the information age.

231
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:16,300
You do not have a business if you cannot,
not in the information aiming, if you cannot

232
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:18,280
innovate and differentiate yourselves.

233
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:24,170
There are two ways you can get competitive
advantage through differentiation, and price.

234
00:16:24,170 --> 00:16:30,240
I don't think anybody really wants to battle
anybody on price.

235
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:38,649
When you differentiate your services and products,
you can, this is really something, look at

236
00:16:38,649 --> 00:16:44,460
Louis Vuitton, nobody needs one of those bags
but I see tons of them.

237
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:52,380
All you need is a sack from the grocery store,
but people have different ideas of what they

238
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:54,190
value.

239
00:16:54,190 --> 00:17:06,210
Building stakeholder focus is a proactive
approach to addressing inclusion to diversity.

240
00:17:06,210 --> 00:17:09,310
Woof to have a plan.

241
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:13,640
It has to be strategic because, when we don't
do that, underrepresented and marginalised

242
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:16,610
individuals are harmed by our actions.

243
00:17:16,610 --> 00:17:26,180
This is the reason I have a problem with stack
overflow today.

244
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:31,050
I have a serious problem that, for the last
three years, their survey indicates that 92

245
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:37,110
per cent of their survey participants were
white males between the ages of 18 to 34.

246
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:41,930
White males between the ages of 18 to 24,
you're my target audience because you're the

247
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:42,930
bottleneck.

248
00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:43,950
You're in the way.

249
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:49,290
There is nothing wrong with you, I have nothing
against you.

250
00:17:49,290 --> 00:17:51,560
But you are in the way.

251
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:55,940
What I don't like about the stack overflow
issue is the fact that businesses are looking

252
00:17:55,940 --> 00:18:00,170
at that as if that is a representation of
the global community.

253
00:18:00,170 --> 00:18:01,180
It is not.

254
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:05,570
It's a representation of those individuals
who feel safe enough to engage and gamify

255
00:18:05,570 --> 00:18:07,940
stack overflow.

256
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:13,720
[Cheering and Applause].

257
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:19,810
I'm currently hearing that people are going
on interviews and asking, "I need to see your

258
00:18:19,810 --> 00:18:21,810
GitHub and stack overflow score."

259
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:22,810
What?

260
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:29,660
What does that have about me doing my day
to day job.

261
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:35,380
Because women, people of colour, people with
disabilities, are not actively engaging on

262
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:38,100
stack overflow, they don't have scores.

263
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:43,380
It means these decisions by business leaders
are impacting us financially.

264
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:47,830
And you really don't have a right to mess
up my money.

265
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:54,630
Is so stop making these stupid decisions.

266
00:18:54,630 --> 00:19:00,880
So I'm going to take you from a process shifting
from a product or service focus to a business-model

267
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:01,880
focus.

268
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,680
Step one.

269
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:10,070
I have now know clients imagine — imagine
what the ideal stakeholder experience would

270
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:11,080
look like.

271
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:17,350
I don't have my clients talk about their product
or service until several sessions later, because

272
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:18,350
that doesn't matter.

273
00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:22,150
If you do this part right, you can pivot,
change, do everything.

274
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:25,130
You should not be married to a product or
service.

275
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:29,910
That's also what gets us in trouble, because
we can't change it, and even though our customers,

276
00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:35,891
all of our stakeholders are not saying this
is working for me, stack overflow, you're

277
00:19:35,891 --> 00:19:41,380
holding on to this, and those who follow me
know that I'm into stack overflow right now,

278
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:50,020
so I have a problem because they — is the
hub in the wheel?

279
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:55,800
The hub of every developer community in the
world.

280
00:19:55,800 --> 00:20:02,870
You cannot tell me, especially when we're
talking about AI machine-learning and deep-learning,

281
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:06,940
that that code on that website is not biased.

282
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:14,930
So, you have people who don't feel safe enough
to engage on that site, so they copy and paste

283
00:20:14,930 --> 00:20:15,930
the code.

284
00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:21,150
At some point, there's going to be a tipping
point where we have a problem.

285
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:29,761
So this process is not outlining, not outlining,
so you're not saying step one, step two, you

286
00:20:29,761 --> 00:20:34,810
really want to get into the feel how you want
your customers to feel when they come in contact

287
00:20:34,810 --> 00:20:35,810
with your organisation.

288
00:20:35,810 --> 00:20:37,360
It's not about product or services at this
point.

289
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:40,790
What do you want them to feel when they come
in contact with you?

290
00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:47,790
When they reach out to you and say, "I need
help, because," how do you want them to feel

291
00:20:47,790 --> 00:20:49,980
through the whole process?

292
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:51,290
And this takes time.

293
00:20:51,290 --> 00:20:54,840
Some clients I have recently thought it was
going to be because they're in El Salvador

294
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:56,660
thought it would take them a few hours.

295
00:20:56,660 --> 00:21:00,211
It took them a week to get their assignment
back to me, because you really have to think

296
00:21:00,211 --> 00:21:01,740
deeply about this.

297
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:06,210
It's time for you to tap into the emotions.

298
00:21:06,210 --> 00:21:07,840
We go back to Louis Vuitton.

299
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:11,590
The only reason why people buy it is because
there's an emotional attachment to that — that's

300
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:19,500
what high-priced goods are, they elicit an
emotion in us.

301
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:25,350
You want to use adjectives, descriptive words.

302
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:27,690
This is ago an example I'm going to give you.

303
00:21:27,690 --> 00:21:31,330
You have to create indicators.

304
00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:32,800
So this is me.

305
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,800
Oops.

306
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:34,800
Yes.

307
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,000
So, define.

308
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:41,790
So my company, you want to put a company name,
it has a commitment to.

309
00:21:41,790 --> 00:21:50,260
Kim Crayton has a commitment to positive change
in the technology sector.

310
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:56,590
Anybody who follows me knows that is what
I do.

311
00:21:56,590 --> 00:21:59,410
So now you want to define your core values.

312
00:21:59,410 --> 00:22:06,370
My company is to promote positive organisational
and community change in fun and engaging ways.

313
00:22:06,370 --> 00:22:10,000
That's why I have the music, conferences and
shirts.

314
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,020
This stuff is hard enough.

315
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:18,240
I need people to feel safe and comfortable,
and welcome to have these challenging, complex

316
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:23,880
conversations.

317
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:26,840
So you want to know what that looks like,
what that experience looks like.

318
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:28,770
Then you want to define your indicators.

319
00:22:28,770 --> 00:22:34,550
For me, it is to get more clients, so that
means to me, I will know that I have more

320
00:22:34,550 --> 00:22:39,210
clients because I'm meeting or exceeding my
monthly financial goals.

321
00:22:39,210 --> 00:22:44,790
I'm getting attention because I have a significant
growth in brand awareness.

322
00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:51,530
I'm getting more Twitter followers, for Instagram
followers, getting people say do you want

323
00:22:51,530 --> 00:22:53,750
to be on my podcast?

324
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:54,770
And then I want data.

325
00:22:54,770 --> 00:23:00,770
I want to track client outcomes, so when I'm
working with my personal clients, I want to

326
00:23:00,770 --> 00:23:07,081
make sure I provide them with a simple thing
— a testimonial.

327
00:23:07,081 --> 00:23:12,420
All they have to do is fill in the blanks,
at my conferences, a survey or something.

328
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:15,100
I want to get that data.

329
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:16,410
Then you want to apply it.

330
00:23:16,410 --> 00:23:17,910
You want to apply measurements.

331
00:23:17,910 --> 00:23:25,090
You cannot manage what you can not measure
this X number of dollars per months by December

332
00:23:25,090 --> 00:23:26,250
31st.

333
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:28,580
Get attention.

334
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:36,140
Be a guest on X number of podcasts, or write
in X number of publications by this time,

335
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:38,740
and I will identify that.

336
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:40,000
And give data.

337
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,620
X number of testimonials, referrals, sponsorships.

338
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:48,580
These are things that I have identified so
that I can measure myself against it.

339
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:55,100
So then I ask myself: what must we must we
have reach this benchmark to know that we

340
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:56,210
claim success.

341
00:23:56,210 --> 00:24:00,300
We can't say I got halfway there because you're
not measuring.

342
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:05,250
I say got halfway there but these are the
reasons I only got halfway there, so this

343
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:06,500
may be a success.

344
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:11,480
You maybe only got halfway there because you
had to pivot ahead and be a more successful

345
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:16,380
opportunity but you will not know that if
you haven't sat down and written these things

346
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:17,380
out.

347
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:22,420
This step is where a deep — where you develop
effective metrics for measuring your core

348
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:23,510
values.

349
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:30,520
So, my core values again are to promote positive
organisational community change in fun and

350
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:32,640
engaging ways.

351
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:36,510
This is how you turn — because people like
how do you get these adjectives.

352
00:24:36,510 --> 00:24:40,480
This is why code of conducts don't work all
the time, because "be nice" — what does

353
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,580
that mean?

354
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:44,760
Everyone has a different idea of what be nice
is.

355
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:47,330
You need to figure out words that are measurable.

356
00:24:47,330 --> 00:24:53,000
I also don't like "harassment", because if
you've not defined it in the beginning, some

357
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,400
people have a different idea of what harassment
is.

358
00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:00,020
That would lead to the MeToo movement.

359
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:05,370
Then you want to test the indicators with
your stakeholders, and you want to collect

360
00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:09,350
data interest them data are the facts, but
again, that's not enough.

361
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:13,300
You want their feedback, their feelings, and
their reactions, so it is two ways of collecting

362
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:14,300
data.

363
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:19,650
You want to collect information, so you want
to get that hard data, that quantitative data,

364
00:25:19,650 --> 00:25:23,960
but you also want to get that qualitative
data, because, without both, you do not have

365
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:27,870
a complete picture.

366
00:25:27,870 --> 00:25:33,130
And then you want to evaluate your measurements
to determine if your benchmarks are not met.

367
00:25:33,130 --> 00:25:34,660
This is where people mess up.

368
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:38,910
You want to know why, if you did meet — what
did you do?

369
00:25:38,910 --> 00:25:41,920
Write that stuff down.

370
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:47,600
If you did not talk about it and write that
stuff down.

371
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:52,510
Use knowledge from evaluation and testing
to refine the process, and you're going to

372
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:55,920
iterate, and tell people as you iterate your
product or service, you need to be iterating

373
00:25:55,920 --> 00:26:03,300
your culture and values, need to be testing,
figuring out is this working for you do we

374
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:04,450
need to change that?

375
00:26:04,450 --> 00:26:10,010
You need to be doing it just like a sprint.

376
00:26:10,010 --> 00:26:11,570
And then you need to standardise it.

377
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:16,851
Once you have something that's concrete, a
little, I mean, more concrete, because it's

378
00:26:16,851 --> 00:26:21,660
never going to be concrete, you need to create
former processes on the knowledge from the

379
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:28,970
evaluations, you need to adopt explicit language
and explicit things you can write documentation.

380
00:26:28,970 --> 00:26:33,740
Documentation is the best ways, one of the
first ways that you can be more inclusive

381
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:34,840
in your communities.

382
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:40,400
You need to be writing documentation, in particular
if you have customers that use that to create,

383
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:45,890
or use that to answer questions, your documentation
is not a one-stop thing, it is a continuous

384
00:26:45,890 --> 00:26:46,910
cycle.

385
00:26:46,910 --> 00:26:48,630
You need to share tacit knowledge.

386
00:26:48,630 --> 00:26:55,230
Tacit knowledge is what you turn information
into personal knowledge, and so, if I'm doing

387
00:26:55,230 --> 00:27:00,280
something, and I have a task, and I've done
it a few times, now I have my own way of doing

388
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:01,280
that.

389
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:04,750
You need to not only capture that but that
needs to be shared throughout the organisation,

390
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:12,210
because in an information economy, it is that
tacit knowledge that will allow you to differentiate

391
00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:15,800
and be competitive if the . Not this book
knowledge or these binders.

392
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:20,880
That's not the information you need that's
going to make you competitive.

393
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:26,000
Core values should be inform all organisational
decisions, and we're going to show you what

394
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,800
I mean in a minute.

395
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:30,390
Remember that this is an ongoing process.

396
00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:35,470
The decisions that are the result of this
process should be seen, not seen as immutable

397
00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:37,600
or rigid.

398
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:42,480
Organisation of leaders should plan to re
view whether stakeholders factors have changed,

399
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:49,270
at least, at a minimum, two times a year,
because you need to be shifting.

400
00:27:49,270 --> 00:27:56,400
When leaders create organisations around well-defined
and tested core values that consider the needs

401
00:27:56,400 --> 00:28:02,470
of all stakeholders, and have processes in
place to monitor progress, again, it is all

402
00:28:02,470 --> 00:28:07,520
stakeholders' measurements, they are less
likely to discover at some point in the future

403
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:12,040
that they've been nurturing a toxic environment.

404
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:13,400
This is my first example.

405
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:18,050
What I talk about my core values, what are
the changes of this community in a positive

406
00:28:18,050 --> 00:28:19,910
way, and a fun way, right?

407
00:28:19,910 --> 00:28:22,510
The first example, this fits into my core
values.

408
00:28:22,510 --> 00:28:26,080
I have Cause a Scene merchandise.

409
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:35,320
It's — I'm going to be honest with you,
I don't ever remember what I said in my talks.

410
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:39,050
So people come back and say, "You sound like
that's good, I'm going to write that down."

411
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:44,890
So I have several items on this website, because,
again, I have a problem with people not wanting

412
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:46,230
to pay for this.

413
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:50,700
I just like you go to work every day, you
expect a cheque, the things I do, I expect

414
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:52,230
to get paid for.

415
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:55,130
The second example — yes, wooh!

416
00:28:55,130 --> 00:28:56,130
Exactly.

417
00:28:56,130 --> 00:28:58,600
The second example is the conference.

418
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:05,430
So the conference is all about — again,
I'm an educator, and a special needs certified,

419
00:29:05,430 --> 00:29:10,200
so I'm used to working with students to demonstrate
how to do something.

420
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:14,240
So I'm really sick and tired of people talking
about, "We can't find underrepresented and

421
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:17,360
marginalised people to speak at our conferences."

422
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:20,730
You don't have an excuse any more because
I'm showing you how to do it.

423
00:29:20,730 --> 00:29:27,240
Again, my conference is Monday night, I'm
sorry, I use the English thing, because I

424
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:32,090
informed you think I'm talking 7.30 in the
morning.

425
00:29:32,090 --> 00:29:33,160
Heck, no.

426
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:35,210
It's 7.30 pm until 11 pm.

427
00:29:35,210 --> 00:29:40,370
It's not in the morning.

428
00:29:40,370 --> 00:29:46,500
The next example of me using my core values
to make decisions is my podcast.

429
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:50,030
Just launched on Wednesday, this past Wednesday.

430
00:29:50,030 --> 00:29:51,910
It is the raw deal Holyfield.

431
00:29:51,910 --> 00:29:56,220
We're talking about everything, because we
need to have these conversations so we can

432
00:29:56,220 --> 00:30:01,210
move through them been it's not until we have
the challenging conversations, and white men,

433
00:30:01,210 --> 00:30:06,150
I'm going to tell you: if you're feeling uncomfortable,
you're only feeling this much discomfort.

434
00:30:06,150 --> 00:30:08,400
I walk around in this every single day.

435
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:10,540
If I can deal, you can.

436
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:15,530
[Cheering and Applause].

437
00:30:15,530 --> 00:30:19,850
And the fourth example is the leadership training,
the coaching that I'm doing, I'm doing some

438
00:30:19,850 --> 00:30:22,380
consulting while I'm here.

439
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:27,140
And this is — I'm doing — so this is also
showing you and giving you a demonstration

440
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:34,680
of how I've used my core values to dictate
how I get so my stakeholders and my customers.

441
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:35,680
So, thank you.
