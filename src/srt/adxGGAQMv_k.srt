00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:23,740

hi guys and

2
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:25,880
I

3
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:29,980
nice to be here myself and my colleagues

4
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:31,660
has been coming for the past three years

5
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:41,110
so it's nice to be back so let's see all

6
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:48,269
right so this again hello CSS huh and

7
00:00:48,269 --> 00:00:53,739
everything is done in CSS 3d well a bit

8
00:00:53,739 --> 00:00:56,260
of like a floating debris is if I don't

9
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:58,980
know if you like gravity or best era

10
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:04,239
alright alright so my top today the up

11
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:09,840
line will be talking about Tubba pjs why

12
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:15,100
this talk is about CSS 3d renderer and a

13
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:18,190
bit of history like you know what we're

14
00:01:18,190 --> 00:01:22,000
behind the scenes as a developer and you

15
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,979
know a bit of what goes under the hood

16
00:01:23,979 --> 00:01:27,429
in this renderer no Bo you know what

17
00:01:27,429 --> 00:01:29,440
what's gonna happen next are we going to

18
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:35,259
use this stuff a day so three dot CSS 3

19
00:01:35,259 --> 00:01:37,780
dot CSS 3d render that's the convention

20
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:42,819
that we use for the 3gs library but

21
00:01:42,819 --> 00:01:45,429
first you will say what you know why are

22
00:01:45,429 --> 00:01:47,380
we talking about a GS like real Tecna

23
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:54,369
CSS conference and in fact it's probably

24
00:01:54,369 --> 00:01:56,440
not you know maybe talk about three

25
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:58,869
years many people you know this uh Bobby

26
00:01:58,869 --> 00:02:02,440
says that the JavaScript library for

27
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:05,080
back via I mean you could look at es

28
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:08,979
it's only a josh a backyard library or

29
00:02:08,979 --> 00:02:10,810
you could think that art is the best

30
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:13,590
javascript library for free jet you know

31
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:20,110
hopefully it later and and and so so one

32
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:23,590
thing for that is that great things

33
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:27,780
doesn't belong alone it's

34
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:30,360
cut juice which is the nickname my

35
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:34,709
colleagues give me and maybe we'll go

36
00:02:34,709 --> 00:02:38,190
mon Dieu why you know what good things

37
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:40,770
doesn't have to be you know what doesn't

38
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:44,030
have to be alone or why I things alone

39
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:51,140
so BR 3gs is a JavaScript library and

40
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:55,739
it's hosted on github what number of

41
00:02:55,739 --> 00:02:59,310
contributors and you can see quite a bit

42
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:04,230
of following and in a guy behind that

43
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:08,600
Ricardo otherwise known as mr. bill it's

44
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:13,050
started this project so a bit of 3gs

45
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:17,850
like it's a rendering engine and you use

46
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:20,250
that to render scene so there's only

47
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:21,959
four things that you need first it is a

48
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:25,519
sin second is objects objects can be

49
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:28,709
measures you know 3d models materials

50
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:34,200
light a grouping of 3d objects and Telus

51
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:37,049
camera where since this is a budget

52
00:03:37,049 --> 00:03:41,900
releasing you want to do have a camera

53
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:45,540
to capture like what the camera sees and

54
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:47,640
you have perspective and photographic

55
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,650
perspective is what is what your eye

56
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:54,510
sees like as things goes out how this

57
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:56,760
goes down the road you know the houses

58
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:59,880
appear smaller orthography is like when

59
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,890
you use it like for some autographic

60
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:04,620
drawings like the same objects of the

61
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:07,200
same size appear to be the same length

62
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,290
when it's maybe on paper or on your

63
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:15,150
screen and lastly spread the road and so

64
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:18,660
is sorry you can see that this really

65
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:21,930
you know not just better in the room yes

66
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:24,930
chemist renderer bacteria SVG software

67
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:27,630
renderer I will not go so much into it

68
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:31,040
but the idea is that 3gs is a web

69
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:35,750
you know JavaScript rendering engine

70
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:39,110
where you could basically say that you

71
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:41,560
know you have a senior objects you could

72
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:44,440
use a perspective camera camera

73
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:47,690
orthographic camera and likewise the

74
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:52,580
renderer kinda modular you know you

75
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:54,890
could play a chemist renderer for web we

76
00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:58,160
are in durham and how much renderer has

77
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,190
been more popular or the past years

78
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:03,050
because back we are is not be supported

79
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:08,740
like on many platforms but like with iOS

80
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:11,990
8 we have mobile devices running back

81
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:15,020
here so in a new releases of 3gs like

82
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:22,150
bacteria is the default 3gs renderer so

83
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:24,740
it's how you do it in code where you

84
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:28,040
have a scene you know you're right noon

85
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:32,060
same camera a new perspective camera and

86
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:35,830
render oh yeah new babe gia render and

87
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:38,990
you add objects fiber objects to the

88
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:42,260
scene and the car ended up render the

89
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:47,060
scene and camera passing so nice thing

90
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:50,990
about the CSS video and array is that it

91
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:55,790
works like almost aware you will see for

92
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:59,150
a WebGL see a second set of a new tree

93
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:02,230
German Darrell you would actually use

94
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:09,350
CSS 3d render and you do the same which

95
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:13,760
is you include a 3gs library you include

96
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:16,720
the CSS 3d render JavaScript farm

97
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,860
because it does not come with the

98
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:22,790
default view is this is in a sauce in

99
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:25,790
the github repository and you create Dom

100
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:29,660
elements a basic back then in 3d objects

101
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:30,090
and

102
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:33,510
3ds 3ds practice and then they see and

103
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:35,330
then you could have any made Emma

104
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:40,229
interactivity so as I mentioned if you

105
00:06:40,229 --> 00:06:43,139
wrap them in 3d objects are 3d sprites

106
00:06:43,139 --> 00:06:46,050
so basically you can just create a Dom

107
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:54,240
element and and basically the difference

108
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:58,380
is that a 3d object kind of has a

109
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:01,229
perspective like when you rotate it if

110
00:07:01,229 --> 00:07:05,130
you say it's like a paper being rotated

111
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:07,860
in 3d space while at release flag is

112
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:10,440
like a beer bar which faces you all the

113
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:17,870
time that is the one in the middle

114
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:21,870
alright so I mean why will you use a CSS

115
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:25,080
3d render night you know yeah WebGL is

116
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:29,510
gaining popularity you know it runs on

117
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:34,110
iOS and no longer problem IE 11 runs

118
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:39,350
bactria so why CSS 3d so what a benefit

119
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:42,660
which I wish I think it is really great

120
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:43,770
about this is that it's really

121
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:49,110
lightweight in fact if you if you take

122
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:53,340
all the things that just this to render

123
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:55,290
to leave your package the library for

124
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:59,160
with the CSS 3d render without bacteria

125
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:02,490
or canvas is probably before GZ is a

126
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:07,310
rocky Cavey so it's very small you know

127
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:12,930
not not a concern right the default I

128
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:17,010
think the back job you is about 200 200

129
00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:20,130
kb so matter benefits like if you are

130
00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:22,320
used if you are web developer and you

131
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:25,800
you are used to having Dom elements so

132
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,990
this is really great like instead of

133
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:31,440
missing a vector in a standard flow you

134
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,800
have to create a 3d models like some

135
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:37,830
form of a geometry and then you have to

136
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:42,570
create materials say a basic material

137
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:45,030
you know if a flat shading or you could

138
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:51,030
have a look lumber shading so so you

139
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:52,470
have to put lights in there and

140
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:55,800
calculate what how smooth shading or is

141
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:59,130
it flexion in that unit but policy for

142
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:02,040
CSS 3d render is this just an amazing

143
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:06,389
elements so no Shay does no material no

144
00:09:06,389 --> 00:09:10,500
measures which really simple and so that

145
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:13,740
the things they are animating is yes CSS

146
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:16,440
sub which is because the star in

147
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,180
whatever ways in life I'd like to put a

148
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:20,639
curve radius model to it you could do it

149
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:24,149
and when you have all these objects

150
00:09:24,149 --> 00:09:25,350
which are any way through you could

151
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:28,920
actually a Dom events Angela right we're

152
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:34,139
going to mouse over mouse click well in

153
00:09:34,139 --> 00:09:37,800
a typical web jockey mesh renderer the

154
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:40,380
browser vendors to a canvas which is

155
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:43,290
basically and what you get is you do a

156
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:46,259
mouse move you get have get academics

157
00:09:46,259 --> 00:09:50,190
and you have to do a kick to find back

158
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:52,649
what object you actually the cursor is

159
00:09:52,649 --> 00:09:59,339
on this mobile friendly it runs on quite

160
00:09:59,339 --> 00:10:04,589
many mobile devices and draw iOS and

161
00:10:04,589 --> 00:10:10,399
it's pretty performer so then this year

162
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:14,850
John Brown he actually gave a talk scss

163
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:17,959
comfy you on his experience working

164
00:10:17,959 --> 00:10:23,490
using the CSS 3d render with for

165
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:26,910
projects for google like for example the

166
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:30,300
showcase a website of google.com / our

167
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:36,060
own so it is a recommended top and if

168
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:37,740
you have done you know grammar check

169
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:45,000
data and slice of history probably too

170
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,970
small to read but there I'll just go

171
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:52,410
ahead does that explain so I mean if you

172
00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:56,610
watch iron man you will see that is

173
00:10:56,610 --> 00:10:58,450
navigating some

174
00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:17,040
using the faces

175
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:21,379
right and oops

176
00:11:21,379 --> 00:11:25,530
love it

177
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:29,380
and

178
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:36,770
and the story goes that famous actually

179
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:39,470
wrote the library to have to be able to

180
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:44,080
do like obvious render on your iPad and

181
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:48,440
so they so there is the famous library

182
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:52,790
for deck and Ricardo stud good kind of

183
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:56,180
black sea okay you know my snake is not

184
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:57,980
to say it's not back yeah it's not

185
00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:01,670
converse so what lies that he has to be

186
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:06,410
CSS 3d and and so mr. Duke did this

187
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:21,980
experiment himself there you have it

188
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:28,170
and rotate it

189
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:37,670
so I this is in CSS 3d

190
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:41,010
all right yeah i mean this this is a

191
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:43,950
screen shot of you know of this i'm

192
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:48,300
running an ipad suddenly say okay great

193
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:51,960
but how does it work and the thing

194
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:54,540
behind this is 3d transforms yes

195
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:57,899
actually transforms and let's let me

196
00:12:57,899 --> 00:13:00,839
just do a quick demo and so this another

197
00:13:00,839 --> 00:13:03,500
example which comes in a previous

198
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:09,779
examples in and you can see this is

199
00:13:09,779 --> 00:13:14,160
basically rendering a panoramic view in

200
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:20,370
a in a sky box and if we take if we

201
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:23,459
inspect the element you can see these

202
00:13:23,459 --> 00:13:25,260
are all bound elements it's basically

203
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:33,430
image and if you so less this

204
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,670
Cilic

205
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:38,600
and you can see that the matrices are

206
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:42,860
changing so this is how CSS 3d render it

207
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:49,460
works maybe a big too complex and and so

208
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:52,250
I will do try a bit of light coating so

209
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:56,270
this is basically that's a relief in a

210
00:13:56,270 --> 00:14:01,010
really simple HTML file let's just hit

211
00:14:01,010 --> 00:14:08,630
the body and the d200 fix str Crixus so

212
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:20,000
let's use them

213
00:14:20,010 --> 00:14:28,970
fun and let's try skill

214
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:31,329
x

215
00:14:31,329 --> 00:14:35,230
and see that it changes may be less the

216
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:39,939
area fine with the step transition yeah

217
00:14:39,939 --> 00:14:42,399
not recommended to use off a performer

218
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:44,860
results back you know for laziness I

219
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:50,199
will just do that is in and if I play

220
00:14:50,199 --> 00:14:54,600
around this number can see that it moves

221
00:14:54,600 --> 00:15:01,059
okay so now we let's try rotate and we

222
00:15:01,059 --> 00:15:08,709
try wrap it say z 5 degrees maybe a bit

223
00:15:08,709 --> 00:15:12,790
more for some defect and okay rotate Z

224
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:18,819
words and now let's try rotate y orata

225
00:15:18,819 --> 00:15:21,820
types

226
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:25,830
and it's kind of strange like nothing's

227
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:28,350
happening so so why why is this

228
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:30,570
happening so what you have to do is that

229
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:33,120
you have to go to parent element and add

230
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:38,520
a perspective number and there you have

231
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:47,010
it it gets

232
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:49,870
and you see that the mattresses that

233
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:53,140
you've seen before in in in the previous

234
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:56,050
example so you could you could do like

235
00:15:56,050 --> 00:16:03,000
metrics and then you four five six

236
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,760
arguments this is shocking for that more

237
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:26,700
arguments for metrics 3d

238
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:30,620
so this can control the skill and this

239
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:36,290
controls like the translation yeah

240
00:16:36,290 --> 00:16:39,800
matrix is kind of scary like you know I

241
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:43,220
I did not like of these mathematics and

242
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:45,830
do when I start playing this and it's

243
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:51,200
actually not too difficult yeah this is

244
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:54,200
the documentation mvn like matrix what

245
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:58,490
parameters to use and if you like to

246
00:16:58,490 --> 00:17:02,990
learn more about matrices Steven videos

247
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:06,020
as has a good time making back job dance

248
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:08,090
where you have like explains how

249
00:17:08,090 --> 00:17:10,430
mattresses work it's basically a matrix

250
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:13,940
content rotation skill and translation

251
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:17,930
in the concise way and this is what the

252
00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:20,270
CSS 3d render is doing it applies it to

253
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:23,990
the to the Dom element so that you don't

254
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:26,480
have to do likes qxu across the x and

255
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:32,120
that becomes really lengthy so what are

256
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:36,680
the limitations why you know in what

257
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,900
ways the CSS Philly when the right isn't

258
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:44,090
that good so first browser but this was

259
00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:47,840
this was brought up in John Brown's talk

260
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:51,800
to when I does not support physically so

261
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:54,590
physically this basically if you have a

262
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:57,260
3d object in a 2d object and you

263
00:17:57,260 --> 00:18:00,710
basically users have to it maintains

264
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:04,600
like a coordinates in a child object and

265
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:07,580
and without that you can just add

266
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:10,700
objects and objects and we retain the

267
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:14,180
perspective so there are solutions where

268
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:18,740
is 3d render I and an intersection

269
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:21,920
problems like chrome may not be able to

270
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:25,220
render it went to dislike intersect and

271
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:28,050
may not have shows the

272
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:33,030
the dead properly so next restoration so

273
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:34,790
what happens behind the scene is that

274
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:39,420
when you use this seed transforms is

275
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:44,460
dead it gets sense to the GPU so GPU is

276
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:46,560
to simply say that it's a piece of

277
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:48,510
hardware which does graphics and

278
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:51,750
actually does it it's much more

279
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:53,340
efficient to do it on the hardware and

280
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:57,870
do it in software and and so this is

281
00:18:57,870 --> 00:19:04,730
about I did have immediate metrics and

282
00:19:04,730 --> 00:19:09,450
oh and what I wonder demonstrate is that

283
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:15,700
if you zoom in

284
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:18,620
you can see that it is capitulated so

285
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:21,770
this is restoration like if you it's not

286
00:19:21,770 --> 00:19:26,570
like in in if you have a plane in

287
00:19:26,570 --> 00:19:28,970
bacteria and zoomy you can to see that

288
00:19:28,970 --> 00:19:31,010
that's a straight line but over here

289
00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:32,600
when you don't mean that you can see

290
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:35,659
that it gets accelerated it's not not

291
00:19:35,659 --> 00:19:39,440
really a big problem okay let's just lay

292
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:43,760
around this let's go on you can ask you

293
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:47,059
it so when you wrap text if you create a

294
00:19:47,059 --> 00:19:50,419
text element you could have sizing up to

295
00:19:50,419 --> 00:19:53,690
maybe hire fixes and then you get chris

296
00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:58,490
years and the next thing is lei Li me so

297
00:19:58,490 --> 00:20:07,309
I was basic X experimenting and and and

298
00:20:07,309 --> 00:20:11,090
and we had so mr. dilip at this

299
00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:15,470
experiment which wich years ago used to

300
00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:17,990
run performance and when I tried out

301
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:21,559
like that this is in 2012 and it was a

302
00:20:21,559 --> 00:20:24,500
trending one frame per second and so

303
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,809
what possibly change over the years is

304
00:20:26,809 --> 00:20:31,909
the way the browser renders the web page

305
00:20:31,909 --> 00:20:42,560
and

306
00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:45,840
so this was the experiment which I was

307
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,370
playing with which was kind of like

308
00:20:47,370 --> 00:20:54,120
clone of his experiment and enter the

309
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:56,250
dead of view is basically i'm applying a

310
00:20:56,250 --> 00:21:02,399
CSS blur filter three have limited that

311
00:21:02,399 --> 00:21:07,289
objects are leather lab lab okay in in

312
00:21:07,289 --> 00:21:14,190
photography so I thought this was is

313
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:17,909
origin expert experiment and and most

314
00:21:17,909 --> 00:21:21,659
interesting that this was done it's not

315
00:21:21,659 --> 00:21:24,179
with CSS render it was delivered on

316
00:21:24,179 --> 00:21:26,879
renderer so when I went ham Louis

317
00:21:26,879 --> 00:21:29,129
experimenting but we know wise this is

318
00:21:29,129 --> 00:21:31,409
no it's not serious it's not canvas is

319
00:21:31,409 --> 00:21:35,700
not baptized CSS 3d render so I was

320
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:37,409
starting to dig up the history of like

321
00:21:37,409 --> 00:21:40,139
how creatures evolved which was

322
00:21:40,139 --> 00:21:48,090
basically used to bring the Dom elements

323
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:53,380
and so some other tests I did which was

324
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:57,039
like and slowly a like kappa i read

325
00:21:57,039 --> 00:21:59,740
elements and when i hit a thousand we

326
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:01,630
see the frames per second should drop to

327
00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:06,610
about 10 frames a second so what happens

328
00:22:06,610 --> 00:22:09,220
is that there's a limit to how many

329
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:14,950
layers that you could that you could

330
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:18,280
actually enemy if the cssp director but

331
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:20,020
my place is there every time you use a

332
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:22,270
trance electronique you know the

333
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:24,880
translate the heck you are creating a

334
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:30,940
layer and that layer becomes is supposed

335
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:33,820
to be accelerator and and i say the

336
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:35,650
browser composite that we have to put

337
00:22:35,650 --> 00:22:41,640
them together so sao paulo is who is a

338
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:45,850
developer ok for huger has this article

339
00:22:45,850 --> 00:22:48,039
saying bye bye Lea hex like hell of your

340
00:22:48,039 --> 00:22:50,770
chains so I don't like you know we have

341
00:22:50,770 --> 00:22:53,679
found it translate Z is pretty good like

342
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:55,240
you know you mix things and it made much

343
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:58,150
faster if you abuse this feature you

344
00:22:58,150 --> 00:23:00,580
know and you hit like a thousand objects

345
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:02,679
of this your web page is going to slow

346
00:23:02,679 --> 00:23:06,610
down like really badly and he has a

347
00:23:06,610 --> 00:23:09,039
really that occur visa you're making

348
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:12,820
layers is considered dangerous so but as

349
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:15,130
long as you know like what Adam is our I

350
00:23:15,130 --> 00:23:18,159
think it's good to know like how the

351
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:20,650
browser is rendering and and so you

352
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:24,159
would not you know does not apply

353
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:26,830
translate Z on everything and now it

354
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:30,610
means this closet browser to hang so

355
00:23:30,610 --> 00:23:32,980
what question is can CSS 3d render on

356
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:37,659
regular matches like you know like with

357
00:23:37,659 --> 00:23:41,169
the other renderers triggers so this was

358
00:23:41,169 --> 00:23:43,179
an ax prime I wish I did basically

359
00:23:43,179 --> 00:23:47,110
turning a huger object your ambassador

360
00:23:47,110 --> 00:23:49,630
that the CSS 3d render doesn't use

361
00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:50,820
geometry

362
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:54,019
but if it take the user geometry items

363
00:23:54,019 --> 00:23:58,259
in this case is here I could have

364
00:23:58,259 --> 00:24:00,960
translated back into the be rendered

365
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,630
with CSS 3d so my place is the heavy

366
00:24:03,630 --> 00:24:09,269
line here is messages a dominant and now

367
00:24:09,269 --> 00:24:11,730
it is interesting article suspect as a

368
00:24:11,730 --> 00:24:16,200
stack overflow and some vast language is

369
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:22,460
one big contributors his reactive 3gs

370
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:26,450
community lab you know helping before

371
00:24:26,450 --> 00:24:30,419
and this capsule max bhangra you know

372
00:24:30,419 --> 00:24:32,580
but his it's pretty interesting like you

373
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:35,399
know how different people me without a

374
00:24:35,399 --> 00:24:37,889
graphics background we you know we come

375
00:24:37,889 --> 00:24:39,809
together and there's so many interesting

376
00:24:39,809 --> 00:24:43,169
things that come from this 3gs ecosystem

377
00:24:43,169 --> 00:24:49,019
so you got twitter app i think this was

378
00:24:49,019 --> 00:24:53,070
this year are pushing the limits so this

379
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:56,340
was its approach to render for branding

380
00:24:56,340 --> 00:25:05,890
measures

381
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:19,850
the vicious

382
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:21,750
30 New York you can always fight this

383
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:25,860
back with google yeah so this is the

384
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:29,400
classic flocking the butt system

385
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:38,840
in three years but so in CSS reading

386
00:25:38,850 --> 00:25:51,940
that leaves around a place

387
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:53,850
and

388
00:25:53,850 --> 00:25:58,080
performance so not only random Mexico

389
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:02,910
actually emulate the kind of lacking you

390
00:26:02,910 --> 00:26:09,200
have in WebGL

391
00:26:09,210 --> 00:26:11,420
and

392
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:13,490
and what what the more complex is on

393
00:26:13,490 --> 00:26:16,820
purse like giving your friend doing is

394
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:20,390
the support animation we see them that

395
00:26:20,390 --> 00:26:29,810
is how is this possible all right so so

396
00:26:29,810 --> 00:26:32,090
this is another example CSS 3d render me

397
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:47,919
use

398
00:26:47,929 --> 00:26:50,899
and so this link is locked we're

399
00:26:50,899 --> 00:26:57,559
actually find it you could you have a

400
00:26:57,559 --> 00:27:09,840
editor you can actually create stuff

401
00:27:09,850 --> 00:27:12,880
but apart from these like kind of random

402
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:16,630
measures we BBC text is hitting the

403
00:27:16,630 --> 00:27:19,390
limits like it runs like animate the

404
00:27:19,390 --> 00:27:21,130
house reference per second so the

405
00:27:21,130 --> 00:27:23,740
question is is this I know you know the

406
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:27,340
CSS 3d render so my partner is

407
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:29,940
impractical like you know it's used in

408
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:36,940
the google i/o showcase this other

409
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:39,309
experiments which like the following

410
00:27:39,309 --> 00:27:41,289
link shows how you could use WebGL

411
00:27:41,289 --> 00:27:43,600
together CSS 3d render because bacteria

412
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:46,330
as a support rendering text of the box

413
00:27:46,330 --> 00:27:48,490
so you put actually basically just use

414
00:27:48,490 --> 00:27:51,909
text in your Dom elements and and

415
00:27:51,909 --> 00:27:54,100
because it makes perfectly I come back

416
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:59,400
we are the CSS you can actually like

417
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:04,539
have a great neighbors with that more

418
00:28:04,539 --> 00:28:07,090
demos don't I think we might not have

419
00:28:07,090 --> 00:28:10,240
time for this let the experiment for

420
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:12,970
Christmas and I share add some by

421
00:28:12,970 --> 00:28:19,059
imaging so okay so I think I'll

422
00:28:19,059 --> 00:28:23,470
summer-like 3gs isn't just know it's

423
00:28:23,470 --> 00:28:25,990
really popular for back pure it isn't

424
00:28:25,990 --> 00:28:28,539
just like there and sometimes we don't

425
00:28:28,539 --> 00:28:30,340
have to think like no should we use this

426
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:33,280
or use that is it better sometimes it

427
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:35,230
could be compliments and ideas

428
00:28:35,230 --> 00:28:38,169
unrestricted platforms like ideas in a

429
00:28:38,169 --> 00:28:41,289
VFX industry you know is what I would

430
00:28:41,289 --> 00:28:43,630
like to see in Vietnam graphics on the

431
00:28:43,630 --> 00:28:48,039
browser's you know ideas which famous

432
00:28:48,039 --> 00:28:51,929
has could be used in three years and and

433
00:28:51,929 --> 00:28:55,780
the simplicity of this renderer he has a

434
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:57,700
special place in here though you know

435
00:28:57,700 --> 00:29:00,280
these days I and I see I love doing back

436
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:03,559
now and so I

437
00:29:03,559 --> 00:29:07,279
the animal top thank you that's my treat

438
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:11,330
ahead wow I always love the demos please

439
00:29:11,330 --> 00:29:21,259
huge applause for that could you please

440
00:29:21,259 --> 00:29:24,019
elaborate on how the shading of the

441
00:29:24,019 --> 00:29:25,759
polygons worth like for example the

442
00:29:25,759 --> 00:29:33,950
horse okay so for that it's that uses a

443
00:29:33,950 --> 00:29:37,070
slightly cheaper version of the CSS 3d

444
00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:41,570
render that kind of like it does needs

445
00:29:41,570 --> 00:29:44,330
to cut calculate like its shading so

446
00:29:44,330 --> 00:29:46,549
basically picked up the face normals and

447
00:29:46,549 --> 00:29:49,490
there is your classic computer graphics

448
00:29:49,490 --> 00:29:53,960
and of algorithms like you take the

449
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:56,659
normal and the direction of the light

450
00:29:56,659 --> 00:29:59,149
and you kind of let me do a dot vector I

451
00:29:59,149 --> 00:30:03,559
mean sorry a dot a dot product and you

452
00:30:03,559 --> 00:30:06,080
can find it you know how much like you

453
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:08,210
know how how bright you perceive get to

454
00:30:08,210 --> 00:30:11,169
be so that is done in JavaScript and

455
00:30:11,169 --> 00:30:14,480
then you have like this modify the color

456
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:18,499
of the domina moon if you actually ever

457
00:30:18,499 --> 00:30:22,159
used 3d CSS in a normal website to use

458
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:28,610
that that's open some way no yeah yeah i

459
00:30:28,610 --> 00:30:30,499
mean i have if you go to the j s comp

460
00:30:30,499 --> 00:30:34,090
website uses a lot of 3d translations I

461
00:30:34,090 --> 00:30:36,950
try to make use of it somehow I'm sure

462
00:30:36,950 --> 00:30:38,440
there will be more uses in the future

463
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:41,629
how to use 3d CSS to actually give more

464
00:30:41,629 --> 00:30:44,389
personality to websites in normal web

465
00:30:44,389 --> 00:30:46,190
sites like every day shopping website

466
00:30:46,190 --> 00:30:48,350
could use 3d CSS because all that stuff

467
00:30:48,350 --> 00:30:50,899
doesn't just works in your browser right

468
00:30:50,899 --> 00:30:54,259
so thanks again applause for joshua i

469
00:30:54,259 --> 00:30:54,790
think
