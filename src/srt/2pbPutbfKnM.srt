1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:11,299

ah

2
00:00:11,309 --> 00:00:14,110
who knows what the Raphael is raised you

3
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:19,119
can well it's actually pretty quickly

4
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:21,130
grew okay so you shouldn't talk at all i

5
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:24,070
think because i'm not going to say

6
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:27,519
anything you I suppose probably start

7
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:39,380
with demos right away

8
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:45,870
okay so the biggest problem of Raphael

9
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:48,930
is the fact that people usually have no

10
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:52,140
idea what to do is it before I say what

11
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:55,470
it is usually people's like oh it's a

12
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:58,260
nice toy it's nice it's cool good for

13
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:01,800
charts and then just think okay so what

14
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:04,530
could I do about just so I could show

15
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:08,729
you some examples i did recently so this

16
00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:12,509
is a sketch like application i did with

17
00:01:12,509 --> 00:01:16,020
Raphael I did as a side project at my

18
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:20,700
current job we have like a code review

19
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:21,960
tool and we would like to add something

20
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:24,390
like picture review so you could drop

21
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:25,649
some pictures and somebody could you

22
00:01:25,649 --> 00:01:27,899
know come here and say like hey look at

23
00:01:27,899 --> 00:01:32,610
this guy and then just oh like don't

24
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:37,679
look here and let's that's kind of nice

25
00:01:37,679 --> 00:01:42,750
head another guy sorry I'm just need to

26
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:46,140
it's like this yeah tell this very

27
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:50,280
editable only semi-transparent and and

28
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,380
so on and so forth this is like one of

29
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:55,320
use cases how you could use this vector

30
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:56,670
graphic stuff so right Bailey's

31
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:58,200
protector graphics i forgot to say that

32
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,850
if you haven't heard about driverless

33
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:03,240
vector graphics now the animation what's

34
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,799
the vector graphics or graphics library

35
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:07,110
without good animation this actual demo

36
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:09,090
from this side so not really new if

37
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:11,900
you've already been on the website so

38
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:14,670
the idea that as soon as you create any

39
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:17,310
object in Raphael bead circle rectangle

40
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:20,310
or custom shape you could then change

41
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:23,160
the attributes and change it feel

42
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,290
changed stroke change it something else

43
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:26,730
there are lots of attributes i'll talk

44
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:29,310
about it later a bit and of course you

45
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:31,290
could change it instantly or you could

46
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:34,200
change it all the time so for example

47
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,120
you could change the coordinates of the

48
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:38,810
circle and feel all the time like this

49
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:44,310
it's pretty kind of cool thing and you

50
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:46,320
could change the rotation of the airlift

51
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,670
you could change rotation of the

52
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:51,870
rectangle you could change paths into

53
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:53,100
another path

54
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:55,680
so you could grab one part and animated

55
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,800
to another path along the time did I say

56
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,440
it works in a six it works in Isaac's

57
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:06,560
and n is seven here and I ate in 99 in

58
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:13,020
Safari Firefox Opera Chrome ok it's both

59
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:16,650
chrome anyway and well it's not real

60
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:19,740
morphing if you think that it's real

61
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:21,000
morphing instant real morphing it

62
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,490
depends where the coordinates studies it

63
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:25,020
just basically turns from one path into

64
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:27,600
another so for example in this rectangle

65
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:30,590
transforming to triangle centrally

66
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:33,210
nice-looking morphing animation this

67
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:35,820
looks much better here and the only

68
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:38,070
difference in bed with joseph triangle

69
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:39,690
drawn from the left top corner and the

70
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:42,060
bottom rectangle is drawn from the right

71
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:43,950
top corner to make things a bit more

72
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:46,680
smoother but if you put the points in

73
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:49,530
correct way on the path then animation

74
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:52,590
is really smooth like to this circle or

75
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:55,320
for this circle basically the first

76
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:58,020
circle has three points and the first

77
00:03:58,020 --> 00:03:59,550
circle has four point that's why

78
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:00,930
animation so smooth if you have

79
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:03,000
different points it's not really a

80
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,070
smooth so it's great stupid animation

81
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:09,360
the way it could be used could be used

82
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:13,440
for example for the sort of charts and

83
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:17,940
to do the animation on the fly as soon

84
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:19,320
as you create a new object you'd control

85
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,810
any of these parameters and for example

86
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:23,280
you could when you create the curve you

87
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,020
could basically control the curve and

88
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:29,700
change it the way you wish and it's very

89
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:34,200
very dynamic and stuff now the other way

90
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,000
to use like this is something i saw on

91
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,560
best in project and see how that's a

92
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:40,650
cool idea should probably try to create

93
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:44,010
a demo which looks alike and i kinda

94
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:47,090
show this demo now homepage so when you

95
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:49,590
when you edit the page you could say

96
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:51,120
okay now I want to add the comment to

97
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,070
the page so you just click anywhere and

98
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:55,620
you have a menu pops up and you could

99
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:57,500
choose ok when I add comment and

100
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:00,360
something will happen or you say ok when

101
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,800
a favorite this page and pretty

102
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,400
page so again the difference between

103
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:09,430
based on canvas that this actually also

104
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:13,360
works in IE the same way you could use

105
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,870
the gradients in Rafael as well as

106
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:18,729
anything else there are some limitations

107
00:05:18,729 --> 00:05:23,490
that we'll talk about it later okay

108
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:27,729
let's back to our presentation now when

109
00:05:27,729 --> 00:05:35,010
I show it

110
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:38,410
right so this is raphael this is a

111
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:41,690
graphic library written in JavaScript

112
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:44,180
and you could use JavaScript to create

113
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:46,760
graphical stuff and Raphael provides you

114
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:50,150
the adapter to make it work across all

115
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:54,800
the browsers I'm aware off so how is it

116
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:59,060
done well first of all how it was

117
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:02,030
created a bit of history so it was

118
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:06,620
created because I'm stupid I was working

119
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:09,050
on the project for we have like a hag

120
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:12,020
day in atlassian the company i'm working

121
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:15,260
for and i need to create something to

122
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:18,920
impress java developers in the company

123
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,960
and because they're java developers they

124
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,520
have no idea about JavaScript so you

125
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,690
can't impress it with some just

126
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:25,730
something it should create something

127
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:27,920
visual you know so they could ask how

128
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:31,190
the did it so I think oh yeah who

129
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:33,650
create some chatting so I pick out the

130
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:36,500
dojo GFX and start kicking on dodgy GFX

131
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:39,050
trying to draw some stuff i spent one

132
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:42,020
hour and didn't succeed even to draw a

133
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:44,630
circle and i just had ok i'm just idiot

134
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:46,850
i can't find this call this API works i

135
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:50,120
just wrote myself whatever and i start

136
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:55,760
taking on with SVG and vml so basically

137
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:58,970
it's SVG i choose the SVG because I

138
00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:02,240
first of all I was using SVG back in two

139
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:06,810
thousand one and I kind of like it and

140
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:09,920
su G school and SVG support is kind of

141
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:13,490
getting there the only one problem with

142
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:20,090
SVG of course and you know I wouldn't

143
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:21,830
say how much I hate Explorer because

144
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:24,590
it's kind of understandable but believe

145
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:27,790
me guys I hate it a bit more than you

146
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:30,620
because you probably most of you

147
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:32,180
probably never actually work with this

148
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:37,870
monster the BML is a grandfather SVG was

149
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:43,100
created by Microsoft's and visio guys to

150
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:46,520
probably as I assume so when you save to

151
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:48,409
web from Microsoft world or you

152
00:07:48,409 --> 00:07:51,469
odds are you you know lines and curves

153
00:07:51,469 --> 00:07:53,479
and shapes will also be saved and you

154
00:07:53,479 --> 00:07:57,860
could view them in explorer so they come

155
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:59,269
with a standard for vector graphics

156
00:07:59,269 --> 00:08:01,189
which is pretty good in the Indian idea

157
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:05,029
let submitted to w3c w3c rejected it but

158
00:08:05,029 --> 00:08:07,399
they liked the idea so they create SVG

159
00:08:07,399 --> 00:08:09,830
based on vml a Microsoft X will take

160
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:11,449
apart in the creating of SVG but for

161
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:12,830
some reason they decide not to put it

162
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:14,719
into their browser and come with their

163
00:08:14,719 --> 00:08:16,939
proprietary standard which obviously

164
00:08:16,939 --> 00:08:24,259
cooler here it's like G Remo we ml and

165
00:08:24,259 --> 00:08:27,679
SVG share the same idea you could create

166
00:08:27,679 --> 00:08:29,929
objects in the page just like you create

167
00:08:29,929 --> 00:08:31,429
thieves you create circles rectangles

168
00:08:31,429 --> 00:08:36,829
curves whatever and that's it that's as

169
00:08:36,829 --> 00:08:41,329
simple as it is now we ml SVG just two

170
00:08:41,329 --> 00:08:45,019
different api's to kinda the same sort

171
00:08:45,019 --> 00:08:50,800
of engine vml api is a piece of

172
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:58,920
right it's smoking stinky piece of

173
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:03,009
but as soon as i use SVG in vml together

174
00:09:03,009 --> 00:09:05,829
you could make all these guys happy and

175
00:09:05,829 --> 00:09:08,829
they could all show you the same circle

176
00:09:08,829 --> 00:09:12,500
kind of the same way not guaranteed

177
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:15,920
pixel perfect but depends how you wrote

178
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:23,110
it and please not mobile safari here so

179
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:30,290
SVG supported in touch whatever ipod

180
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:34,970
ipod ipad iphone since 2.2 software

181
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:38,569
update so basically everywhere now to

182
00:09:38,569 --> 00:09:41,300
make this tooth these are things are way

183
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:45,310
different like really different

184
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:48,400
like totally different the API is so

185
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:52,330
different SVG in BML and the only way I

186
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:54,279
found to make them all together it's

187
00:09:54,279 --> 00:09:58,600
JavaScript so I create a JavaScript

188
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:01,210
layer which detect the feature do you

189
00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:03,850
support SVG the browser or support vml

190
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:06,610
and use the different methods to

191
00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:11,350
creating the stuff now this is how it

192
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:12,760
looks like in the coverage of the

193
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,800
features the SVG is a bit bigger than

194
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:20,640
vml vml is a bit smaller now the Raphael

195
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:24,310
trying to cover something it could cover

196
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:26,890
everywhere so it doesn't cover all the

197
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:30,430
SVG and doesn't have all the vml but it

198
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:33,880
cover big enough chunk of functionality

199
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:38,020
to create something useful when people

200
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:41,200
complaining about hey guess what you had

201
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,070
this awesome feature like clipping path

202
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:48,580
could you put it in Raphael you could

203
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:50,020
put it in our fail it's open source

204
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:51,580
project as soon as you make it working

205
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:55,990
in explorer I'll be happy absolutely I

206
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:57,520
have no idea how the collision repair

207
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:59,800
how to make it working vml I mean if you

208
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:03,210
can awesome submit the page I will apply

209
00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:10,500
G now Raphael is 20 kilobytes zipped

210
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:16,420
minified it's kind of small now as I say

211
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:18,820
can you do the charge is usual thing is

212
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:20,560
like people like oh yeah awesome i could

213
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:23,170
use it for charts yeah you can use it

214
00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:26,920
for charge it's not only for charts you

215
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:29,560
just saw this protocol presentation like

216
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:33,180
another forty percent of a UI interface

217
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:36,760
elements could be done with Raphael like

218
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:39,040
all these attach it to the anchor so you

219
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,839
could do it with images but with images

220
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:42,550
it will be like okay you have like five

221
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:44,920
images five GTP request all these are

222
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:48,670
steep steep here k SVG it will be much

223
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:51,640
faster one javascript file right which

224
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:53,470
contains all the stuff and most of the

225
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:56,290
time actually the su g is smaller than

226
00:11:56,290 --> 00:11:58,360
the image unless it's you know

227
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,430
photo of your wife or something like

228
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:03,880
that so wait where where it could be

229
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:06,430
used the first and obvious example is

230
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:12,850
Raphael Diaz home side I did the

231
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:14,769
redesign recently and I create all these

232
00:12:14,769 --> 00:12:17,410
images for the icons I droid myself so I

233
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:21,459
don't need to pay anybody so I'm sorry

234
00:12:21,459 --> 00:12:24,959
if it's ugly I draw these icons and I

235
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:30,940
make an amazing laga by SME cube but I

236
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:33,880
found that I have too much HTTP requests

237
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:37,420
and my flgs has about 2,000 hits per day

238
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:40,570
she's not big for some corporate website

239
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:42,339
but pretty big source library

240
00:12:42,339 --> 00:12:46,060
which is special target so it has like

241
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:47,800
lots of hits so I decide okay I could

242
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,990
use surprise i'm smart i read the books

243
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:54,100
so i was i was using sprites and still

244
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:57,160
was like not good enough so i think oh

245
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:59,890
well it's this icons are pretty simple i

246
00:12:59,890 --> 00:13:01,360
could draw them in Raphael I draw them

247
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,310
in vector in the beginning so I draw the

248
00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:08,649
one in Raphael so now I cut another HTTP

249
00:13:08,649 --> 00:13:09,850
request because it's just in my

250
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:12,610
JavaScript and it's actually smaller

251
00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:17,610
than the images and for all this stuff

252
00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:22,269
all this stuff out images this

253
00:13:22,269 --> 00:13:24,600
screenshot contains no images at all

254
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:31,209
right so they are like three files HTML

255
00:13:31,209 --> 00:13:36,640
CSS and JavaScript that's all well the

256
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:39,329
page down there has one image more but

257
00:13:39,329 --> 00:13:43,269
this part doesn't have any how cool

258
00:13:43,269 --> 00:13:47,589
ivette now I I'll quickly show you why

259
00:13:47,589 --> 00:13:52,320
this matter actually this matter because

260
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,209
this is the page right this how it looks

261
00:13:55,209 --> 00:14:02,560
now let's zoom it right because it's not

262
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:07,260
an image it do mean really nice and

263
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:10,000
you'll be surprised but it's printing

264
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:15,100
also very nice when you print it the

265
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:17,140
logo and the icons looks like it's not

266
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:19,180
from the page like it's come from PDF or

267
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:21,550
something if you bring it up by hand you

268
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:23,110
the print out you will never believe

269
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:28,600
it's printed from the web page because

270
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,430
it's vector in explore it work the same

271
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:37,140
way it's not just so size does matter

272
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:40,149
your icons or your logo like if you have

273
00:14:40,149 --> 00:14:42,250
a log office of your company on the page

274
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:44,079
creating recreating the Lord of is

275
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:46,990
Raphael doesn't only make it smaller it

276
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:49,260
also makes it bring nicely and

277
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:51,550
particularly know about the guys who was

278
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:53,110
using Raphael for the application

279
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:54,550
because they have to print it and they

280
00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:57,850
had to have a pie chart and because you

281
00:14:57,850 --> 00:14:59,649
know he woke with a client and client

282
00:14:59,649 --> 00:15:02,589
usually is not technical person which we

283
00:15:02,589 --> 00:15:05,890
call just dumb right so he tastes like

284
00:15:05,890 --> 00:15:10,829
our I pray it up it looks pixelated WTF

285
00:15:10,829 --> 00:15:13,899
but because its image you know the DPI

286
00:15:13,899 --> 00:15:16,209
of the screen is not actually as good as

287
00:15:16,209 --> 00:15:18,250
DPI of the printer like what we can do

288
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:20,649
like I don't know it's pixelated make it

289
00:15:20,649 --> 00:15:23,529
look nice so they pick up the Raphael

290
00:15:23,529 --> 00:15:25,180
and draw the same pie chart with Raphael

291
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:27,730
bring it up everybody's happy looks

292
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:32,350
awesome in print so if you have any

293
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:34,600
icons new page look like icons on the

294
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,910
left is Raphael icons I can on the right

295
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:40,600
I images when you zoom them up the

296
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:46,260
difference is stunning and printing

297
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:49,899
could be very important could be really

298
00:15:49,899 --> 00:15:51,760
a killer I remember when I was

299
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:54,370
developing their application and it

300
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:55,959
could be printed so I have to include

301
00:15:55,959 --> 00:16:00,100
another huge chip file with the logger

302
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:03,040
and resided to make it small and hide it

303
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,440
with CSS and open with the print so it

304
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:08,620
who printed biggest image resume it out

305
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:10,959
so it will be nice on the print and I

306
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:12,760
always feel guilty because I put the

307
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:15,160
extra you know image

308
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:17,440
for the user to download just in case he

309
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:20,139
will print now you don't need to worry

310
00:16:20,139 --> 00:16:21,910
about it just make it a bit Raphael it

311
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:25,959
works and it prints nicely the other

312
00:16:25,959 --> 00:16:29,319
user like UI interface things you could

313
00:16:29,319 --> 00:16:31,000
use ruffle for like for example for

314
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,300
something like base there is actually

315
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:36,939
life example from one of my current

316
00:16:36,939 --> 00:16:40,750
project we have this pop-up appears on

317
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:44,290
the page and you know like in any middle

318
00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:46,810
too big company we have a developer we

319
00:16:46,810 --> 00:16:49,959
have a designer and we have a manager

320
00:16:49,959 --> 00:16:54,120
and the manager says hey we need pop up

321
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:58,720
then I said awesome rounded corners so I

322
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,819
come to design say hey okay rounded

323
00:17:00,819 --> 00:17:03,610
corners let's talk and do you really

324
00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:05,829
need drownded corners like around the

325
00:17:05,829 --> 00:17:07,870
corner sauce that you really really need

326
00:17:07,870 --> 00:17:10,539
rounded first well okay I II could be

327
00:17:10,539 --> 00:17:13,839
without on okay fine I make it with CSS

328
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:16,959
awesome now okay and now this little

329
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:19,480
pixie on the top will be also it's a fix

330
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:22,089
it to show where you okay Trixie okay

331
00:17:22,089 --> 00:17:24,669
draw the image in Photoshop put it in

332
00:17:24,669 --> 00:17:28,539
make it look like this awesome then it

333
00:17:28,539 --> 00:17:31,240
was day of review so me manage and

334
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,590
design is it together and I show them

335
00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:34,840
okay that's how it looks like like how

336
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:37,720
it looks pretty nice is it even the

337
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:41,280
frame too dark making make it lighter

338
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,900
okay yes give me like I don't know ten

339
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:45,789
minutes I have to redraw it and you know

340
00:17:45,789 --> 00:17:47,770
photoshop the image you have to upload

341
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:50,289
it I have to build the package around

342
00:17:50,289 --> 00:17:51,669
the application and doesn't come back

343
00:17:51,669 --> 00:17:53,409
together and I will see could you just

344
00:17:53,409 --> 00:17:54,970
play with fire but now I can't play with

345
00:17:54,970 --> 00:17:56,799
Firebug sorry I could you change the

346
00:17:56,799 --> 00:17:57,909
background I can change the background

347
00:17:57,909 --> 00:18:04,299
like again doesn't come on so every time

348
00:18:04,299 --> 00:18:08,740
I delete all this code and replace this

349
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:11,590
thing with Rafael the next review was so

350
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:14,380
much smoother when I change at ya wanna

351
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:16,120
can we make it a rounded corners a bit

352
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,890
bigger yea big smaller yeah that's it

353
00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:19,330
work at explorer like this yeah it works

354
00:18:19,330 --> 00:18:20,620
explore as it rounded corners in

355
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:21,789
exploring yeah it's rounded corners in

356
00:18:21,789 --> 00:18:24,909
explorer the most complicated past part

357
00:18:24,909 --> 00:18:27,760
was to draw shape like this

358
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:28,600
I should say it's not the most

359
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:31,920
complicated transcribe ahead so I

360
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:37,540
successfully achieve it so Raphael in a

361
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:40,300
UI for UI elements could make your UI

362
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:43,630
more flexible could make you God smaller

363
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:46,150
because if you have similar you are

364
00:18:46,150 --> 00:18:47,860
elements with different color for

365
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:49,980
example you could easily achieve it

366
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:53,230
seeming the UI easily achievable you

367
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:55,570
don't need to create five different

368
00:18:55,570 --> 00:18:58,000
images for gradient background for five

369
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,250
different themes what else you could do

370
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:07,810
let's risk game I started to develop but

371
00:19:07,810 --> 00:19:12,550
i was too lazy to finish and make it

372
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:15,190
works will click on the on the country

373
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:17,170
it's crazy arrows where you want to talk

374
00:19:17,170 --> 00:19:19,330
you click country when I talk they bump

375
00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:22,600
to each other and but then you always

376
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:25,120
bore it and I just the rules are too

377
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:28,590
complicated the javascript is easy so

378
00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:31,060
but you can't do stuff like that you can

379
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:32,770
do it with this this is very small and

380
00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:34,510
if you look at the footprint of this

381
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:40,210
page it's tiny it's tiny because it has

382
00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:43,960
no images again in just one javascript

383
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:48,600
file they another another another

384
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:51,640
unexpected usage for the Raphael we

385
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:55,120
found in our applications this page also

386
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:58,230
contain no images as it all right so

387
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:00,340
this shadow is real shadow

388
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:02,650
semi-transparent so it it's on grey

389
00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:04,030
background you can't really appreciate

390
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:06,010
it but if you have text on the

391
00:20:06,010 --> 00:20:06,970
background or anything it's

392
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:09,010
semi-transparent shadow the shadow done

393
00:20:09,010 --> 00:20:11,730
with Raphael and shadow down with

394
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:15,210
gradients from black to transparent and

395
00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:17,650
we were using the shadow now in our

396
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:21,790
products why because the size of images

397
00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:24,130
to create the shadow is about 100

398
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:27,940
kilobyte the size of profile library 20

399
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:30,160
kilobyte which means even even if you

400
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:32,410
use Raphael just for the shadow nothing

401
00:20:32,410 --> 00:20:34,210
else for the project it's already

402
00:20:34,210 --> 00:20:36,490
worthwhile not mention the draw file is

403
00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:38,680
again just one HTTP request and for

404
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:41,049
images you have like 18 HTTP requests

405
00:20:41,049 --> 00:20:45,429
you can't really surprised them so let's

406
00:20:45,429 --> 00:20:48,519
be win-win and yeah it works in explora

407
00:20:48,519 --> 00:20:52,450
without you know dancing and shaking 96

408
00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:56,499
I mean semi-transparent shadow another

409
00:20:56,499 --> 00:21:04,090
small example it's the table which

410
00:21:04,090 --> 00:21:06,519
exists in the results of some web

411
00:21:06,519 --> 00:21:09,759
development sorry and the JavaScript

412
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:12,100
enhance the table by adding the charting

413
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:15,730
to it this HTML table and underneath of

414
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:17,369
HTML table with javascript is on

415
00:21:17,369 --> 00:21:21,759
creating the chart using Raphael to make

416
00:21:21,759 --> 00:21:24,220
it you know much bit easier readable

417
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:27,730
thing just an enhancement to existing

418
00:21:27,730 --> 00:21:30,309
again it's very nicely when when people

419
00:21:30,309 --> 00:21:33,309
need to print it it brings very nice you

420
00:21:33,309 --> 00:21:41,350
have very nice printing output now as

421
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:45,999
soon as we are at geeky conference I can

422
00:21:45,999 --> 00:21:51,270
talk about geeky stuff

423
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:56,820
ok

424
00:21:56,830 --> 00:21:59,830
I was struggling his animation and then

425
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:01,360
I did animation first time I have the

426
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:05,679
problem after a while as noticed that if

427
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:09,399
you have like this this is in this test

428
00:22:09,399 --> 00:22:11,789
they create like I don't know about 200

429
00:22:11,789 --> 00:22:15,190
circles draw them in the in the line

430
00:22:15,190 --> 00:22:17,080
with the cycle and then I decide okay

431
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:19,019
now all these circles anime to

432
00:22:19,019 --> 00:22:22,659
particular X so they should all you know

433
00:22:22,659 --> 00:22:25,539
come to the one line and then notice

434
00:22:25,539 --> 00:22:28,570
that a because the it takes a while to

435
00:22:28,570 --> 00:22:31,659
animate each circle then when you come

436
00:22:31,659 --> 00:22:33,669
to the last circle the time is different

437
00:22:33,669 --> 00:22:35,409
and the position is different so they're

438
00:22:35,409 --> 00:22:37,510
not moving as a whole line but instead

439
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:41,649
they moving like Yogi and the worst is

440
00:22:41,649 --> 00:22:43,659
browser the jaw gave it an explorer

441
00:22:43,659 --> 00:22:45,429
they're just going like this and then

442
00:22:45,429 --> 00:22:47,559
coming to the line at the end because

443
00:22:47,559 --> 00:22:49,750
they just so they don't have the same

444
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:51,700
time each of them has a separate timer

445
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:56,440
and second because I say animated mist

446
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:57,789
which means I go through all of them and

447
00:22:57,789 --> 00:23:00,039
say animate animated animated animate so

448
00:23:00,039 --> 00:23:01,570
when I come to this guy in the middle I

449
00:23:01,570 --> 00:23:05,340
say animate the start of animation is

450
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:07,360
different from the guy in the beginning

451
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:10,240
because some time has passed but I'd

452
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,669
country so you add another method

453
00:23:12,669 --> 00:23:15,159
animate with and if you have objects in

454
00:23:15,159 --> 00:23:17,500
the group and say animate they all anime

455
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:19,510
twist and never happens like you have a

456
00:23:19,510 --> 00:23:21,580
frame you have a text you animate and

457
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:24,690
text goals you know following the frame

458
00:23:24,690 --> 00:23:30,220
so this is a original video how it was

459
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:35,679
you can see how jog it is and then after

460
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:38,490
update its run very smooth it's very

461
00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:43,680
rock solid line

462
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:51,639
a little bit proud of this ok I know I

463
00:23:51,639 --> 00:23:53,399
know somebody will appreciate it one day

464
00:23:53,399 --> 00:23:59,379
ok in any recent release people start

465
00:23:59,379 --> 00:24:03,070
complaining that in explorer the quality

466
00:24:03,070 --> 00:24:05,230
of the graphics of the shapes to beat

467
00:24:05,230 --> 00:24:08,429
doji you can see the shapes on the left

468
00:24:08,429 --> 00:24:10,929
well you can see they're not as good a

469
00:24:10,929 --> 00:24:14,580
shape on right there are some problems

470
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:17,649
like here they're like some problem with

471
00:24:17,649 --> 00:24:19,720
a dot with the question mark it's not

472
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:21,129
really there they're like one pixel

473
00:24:21,129 --> 00:24:23,830
differences here and there it could be

474
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:26,740
very annoying why it happens because vml

475
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:31,269
is awesome API right in vml when you

476
00:24:31,269 --> 00:24:33,970
specify the path you can specify you

477
00:24:33,970 --> 00:24:35,830
could only specify integer values for

478
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:41,139
pixels in SVG you could specify you know

479
00:24:41,139 --> 00:24:45,700
pixels for floating point numbers so for

480
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:49,210
vml they had to round them the problem

481
00:24:49,210 --> 00:24:50,889
is rounding is of course sometimes one

482
00:24:50,889 --> 00:24:53,710
pixel is not much but sometimes half

483
00:24:53,710 --> 00:24:56,980
pixel is a lot this exact examples of

484
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:59,350
that if you have small shapes like this

485
00:24:59,350 --> 00:25:03,129
32 by 32 icons you could see they are

486
00:25:03,129 --> 00:25:07,350
dodgy on the left then really as smooth

487
00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:12,850
so what I did at the end because vml can

488
00:25:12,850 --> 00:25:15,419
draw with half pixels it's back sorry

489
00:25:15,419 --> 00:25:21,030
engine just API is totally

490
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:25,480
so I draw the image when you create a

491
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:27,520
path i draw image like 10 times bigger

492
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:30,640
and then zoom it in with vml internal

493
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:33,580
features to zoom it down 10 times and

494
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:37,030
then I have precision not one pixel but

495
00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:39,190
one tenth of pixel which is kinda enough

496
00:25:39,190 --> 00:25:41,740
for everybody for so far if it will be

497
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:44,260
enough i will make it 100 times big and

498
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:46,390
and zoom 100 time but 10 times is good

499
00:25:46,390 --> 00:25:48,640
enough and then on the right you could

500
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:51,700
see their icons i compare it with a like

501
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:54,070
firefox rendering in pretty much the

502
00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:57,850
same so I'm pretty happy with that so

503
00:25:57,850 --> 00:25:59,620
this is like in the latest arrival one

504
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:01,450
point three point two in Rafael one

505
00:26:01,450 --> 00:26:03,250
point three point three is on my laptop

506
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:08,710
waiting for be released by the way the

507
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:11,520
whole Raphael was written on the train I

508
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:14,950
have very long connection from work from

509
00:26:14,950 --> 00:26:17,710
home to work with one hour so it's like

510
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:20,440
wasting 12 hours today so i bought the

511
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:23,830
laptop and the whole Raphael Richie my

512
00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:25,600
hundred percent was written on the train

513
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:32,950
on this particular device so and as I

514
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:39,170
said it works in iphone oh sorry on ipad

515
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:44,560
right it doesn't work on Android because

516
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:47,590
android guys doesn't include SVG support

517
00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:53,680
in their web kid I would I wouldn't I

518
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:56,560
wouldn't comment on this just I don't

519
00:26:56,560 --> 00:27:01,510
know I haven't write a line of code to

520
00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:06,400
make Raphael box an iphone as soon as as

521
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,550
soon as OS 2.2 was released for iphone

522
00:27:08,550 --> 00:27:11,080
r-fl just magically started working

523
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:14,860
there let's power web standards because

524
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:17,380
when it's about SVG Rafael relies on web

525
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:21,340
standards that's it when it's about vml

526
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:24,310
it relies on Microsoft implementation of

527
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:28,360
BML because don't be mistaken the vml

528
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:31,180
specification despite written totally

529
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:33,730
buy microsoft and vm i'll implementation

530
00:27:33,730 --> 00:27:34,200
in turn

531
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:38,070
Laura are two different things like if

532
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:39,510
you read MSD and I think that's how

533
00:27:39,510 --> 00:27:41,040
things are that's not housing though

534
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:46,290
right the lots of bugs in like Microsoft

535
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:48,120
lockbox I think they just love insects

536
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:53,070
in general it's likely they create the

537
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:54,810
API they don't command it and they're

538
00:27:54,810 --> 00:27:56,850
like ah c'mon guys boring let's add some

539
00:27:56,850 --> 00:28:01,350
bugs Nate somebody nobody starting from

540
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:03,000
implementing them totally because it's

541
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,850
like yeah I wrote it I implemented like

542
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:10,340
why should make box anyway anyway anyway

543
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:14,880
API I think API is most important part

544
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:18,240
of annual JavaScript library it's

545
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:21,510
probably why jquery so popular I don't

546
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:23,400
want to offend your career but I don't

547
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,690
think it's like the greatest library

548
00:28:24,690 --> 00:28:27,690
ever but I think that API is very

549
00:28:27,690 --> 00:28:30,690
 sweet and that's why it's so

550
00:28:30,690 --> 00:28:33,660
sweet and that's why it's so
great not because it's great library I

551
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:36,210
mean it's good library but because API

552
00:28:36,210 --> 00:28:37,650
is so good that's why it's so popular

553
00:28:37,650 --> 00:28:40,260
that's why you know you can't compete

554
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:42,870
with chick very much so I spend a lot of

555
00:28:42,870 --> 00:28:45,510
time of thinking about API and as soon

556
00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:48,450
as I talk about jQuery I just you know

557
00:28:48,450 --> 00:28:52,410
just steal it from jQuery I Chad this

558
00:28:52,410 --> 00:28:59,460
John he's okay so how to create stuff in

559
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:01,860
Raphael so first of all when you want to

560
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:04,490
draw something you have to create canvas

561
00:29:04,490 --> 00:29:08,640
not bathe canvas okay not html5 can I

562
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,950
like this right look we are smart people

563
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:13,020
okay why are we giving dump names to the

564
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:16,110
product the prototype JavaScript library

565
00:29:16,110 --> 00:29:19,380
the closure JavaScript library the

566
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:23,340
canvas Jamie now I can talk about

567
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:25,650
cameras without confusing people it's

568
00:29:25,650 --> 00:29:27,780
not canvas it's not html5 canvas it's

569
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:29,610
canvas canvas no cameras people drawing

570
00:29:29,610 --> 00:29:36,200
on you know canvas I call it paper okay

571
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:38,580
so you need to create a paper to draw on

572
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:40,650
very simple there's three ways to create

573
00:29:40,650 --> 00:29:46,350
the paper paper Jesus first where you

574
00:29:46,350 --> 00:29:49,470
ride Raphael and put the pre parameters

575
00:29:49,470 --> 00:29:53,010
the ID of placeholder some deep for

576
00:29:53,010 --> 00:29:56,990
example and dimensions within height

577
00:29:56,990 --> 00:30:00,540
second variant you put the actual Dom

578
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:03,570
element placeholder and within high and

579
00:30:03,570 --> 00:30:05,520
the third very end you put top left

580
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,530
within hide depends what is more

581
00:30:07,530 --> 00:30:11,400
suitable for you then as soon as you

582
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:15,080
create a paper you can draw on the paper

583
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:16,980
what you can draw you can draw

584
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:21,270
primitives of course you could draw a

585
00:30:21,270 --> 00:30:24,270
circle you could draw rectangle and you

586
00:30:24,270 --> 00:30:27,570
could roll ellipse this is primitive and

587
00:30:27,570 --> 00:30:29,549
if your indifference to que no es api

588
00:30:29,549 --> 00:30:32,760
actually include soccer function so be

589
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:36,530
thankful for the circle you specify

590
00:30:36,530 --> 00:30:38,460
contents of the center and the radius

591
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:41,850
for the rectangle specify X&Y width and

592
00:30:41,850 --> 00:30:43,530
height and optional radius of the

593
00:30:43,530 --> 00:30:47,280
corners by the way in BML when you

594
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:49,590
specify the radius of the corner you

595
00:30:49,590 --> 00:30:53,340
specified the value of radius is the

596
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:56,309
percentage from the shortest side of the

597
00:30:56,309 --> 00:31:00,650
rectangle it's very convenient indeed

598
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:02,570
so it's not a big sale like if you

599
00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:05,540
specify racine pixels and in SVG

600
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:07,070
specifying pixel and in raphael

601
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:08,930
specifying pixel in VN well it's

602
00:31:08,930 --> 00:31:10,520
percentage of the shortest side of the

603
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:15,380
rectangle for whom ever it could be

604
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:19,430
convenient I have no idea so rough I'll

605
00:31:19,430 --> 00:31:22,010
take care of this and fortunately not

606
00:31:22,010 --> 00:31:25,610
only base and as soon as you create a

607
00:31:25,610 --> 00:31:29,480
element and primitive in this case as

608
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:32,300
you see you I assign it to the to the

609
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:35,390
object to the variable then this object

610
00:31:35,390 --> 00:31:39,500
the primitive is a roper object around

611
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:42,140
the actual representation as with govt

612
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:44,630
ml in the browser and you could access

613
00:31:44,630 --> 00:31:47,930
the actual Dom element by saying so

614
00:31:47,930 --> 00:31:52,730
cannot correct not i would recommend you

615
00:31:52,730 --> 00:31:54,350
to do this only if you really know what

616
00:31:54,350 --> 00:31:57,590
you're doing because SVG in vml are so

617
00:31:57,590 --> 00:31:59,600
way different so if you decide to write

618
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,790
your poem cross-browser think twice

619
00:32:01,790 --> 00:32:04,460
before accessing dot node but I give you

620
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:08,480
this option whatever each year each

621
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:14,270
element has a set of methods the thing

622
00:32:14,270 --> 00:32:16,430
you can do with it so you could animate

623
00:32:16,430 --> 00:32:18,500
you could animate along some path you

624
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:19,910
could animate on some path different

625
00:32:19,910 --> 00:32:21,680
direction you could animate with another

626
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:23,990
element you could set attributes and the

627
00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:26,020
attribute is probably the most useful

628
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:28,010
method so you could set and get

629
00:32:28,010 --> 00:32:30,110
attributes from the element you can

630
00:32:30,110 --> 00:32:33,140
attach event handlers like click on

631
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:35,750
mouse mouse down mouse move mouse out

632
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:40,820
and so far and so forth so and so go so

633
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:44,540
example we create a circle then it's a

634
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:46,700
circle dot attr and you specify the

635
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:49,460
object which have attributes for the

636
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:51,860
circle the attributes that just take

637
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:55,490
from su G specification so if you know

638
00:32:55,490 --> 00:32:57,680
SVG it should be very clean for you what

639
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:58,850
to do if you don't know if you g you

640
00:32:58,850 --> 00:33:02,530
could always read the SVG spec I mean

641
00:33:02,530 --> 00:33:06,140
it's kind of self-explanatory the field

642
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:09,380
is fill and the stroke is stroke color

643
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:12,640
so as Raphael supports not only hex code

644
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,289
hexadecimal

645
00:33:14,289 --> 00:33:16,609
representation of the color but also RGB

646
00:33:16,609 --> 00:33:19,669
and I also include HSB now hue

647
00:33:19,669 --> 00:33:21,109
saturation brightness because it's kind

648
00:33:21,109 --> 00:33:25,969
of awesome to have and stroke width

649
00:33:25,969 --> 00:33:28,669
could be Mariah it's also only pixels

650
00:33:28,669 --> 00:33:31,219
and opacity is from 0 to 1 you also

651
00:33:31,219 --> 00:33:34,429
could specify all the parameters like CX

652
00:33:34,429 --> 00:33:36,409
CY and radios in fact you could create

653
00:33:36,409 --> 00:33:37,969
circle without parameters at all you

654
00:33:37,969 --> 00:33:40,039
could just say create circle with

655
00:33:40,039 --> 00:33:42,499
bracket bracket and let's say I TTR and

656
00:33:42,499 --> 00:33:45,319
put all the attribute there you could

657
00:33:45,319 --> 00:33:47,809
grab attributes by specifying the string

658
00:33:47,809 --> 00:33:51,019
and obviously you could animate when you

659
00:33:51,019 --> 00:33:53,599
animate the first parameter is also the

660
00:33:53,599 --> 00:33:55,459
same attribute object so this is

661
00:33:55,459 --> 00:33:58,399
attributes where you wanna object half

662
00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:00,739
after the animation not all attributes

663
00:34:00,739 --> 00:34:05,599
are animatable it's kind of obvious and

664
00:34:05,599 --> 00:34:07,759
you could have a millisecond you have

665
00:34:07,759 --> 00:34:10,819
obviously called back and you could have

666
00:34:10,819 --> 00:34:13,190
easy and you can create your own heating

667
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:16,190
if you don't like the existing easel so

668
00:34:16,190 --> 00:34:18,259
the attributes exist on the all the

669
00:34:18,259 --> 00:34:21,019
objects all the elements are base of

670
00:34:21,019 --> 00:34:23,119
course some of them are only makes sense

671
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:26,480
for some elements like GRC have only

672
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:30,829
sense for images font only have sense

673
00:34:30,829 --> 00:34:36,319
for text target the target make sense

674
00:34:36,319 --> 00:34:39,559
for everything so you could add a href

675
00:34:39,559 --> 00:34:42,859
for any element make it a hyperlink you

676
00:34:42,859 --> 00:34:44,869
could add rotation the path only makes

677
00:34:44,869 --> 00:34:48,559
sense for path so perfect hey this world

678
00:34:48,559 --> 00:34:50,029
perfect how you English speaker

679
00:34:50,029 --> 00:34:54,529
pronounces but it's it's when you you

680
00:34:54,529 --> 00:34:56,480
could create different custom puffs and

681
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:58,609
that's the most powerful thing about

682
00:34:58,609 --> 00:35:01,190
Rafael so the path in text is very

683
00:35:01,190 --> 00:35:05,869
simple you say paper the path and put

684
00:35:05,869 --> 00:35:11,119
the past ring easy there example of

685
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:13,820
pastoring

686
00:35:13,830 --> 00:35:18,330
it's very simple I'm sorry it's right

687
00:35:18,330 --> 00:35:26,160
for I try to mess with G so I like it's

688
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:29,550
like not rocket science really I said

689
00:35:29,550 --> 00:35:32,430
I'll explain it to it it's actually much

690
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:35,640
simpler than it looks so it's all in SVG

691
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:37,200
spec and you could read it if you want

692
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:42,030
to write it by hand but basically their

693
00:35:42,030 --> 00:35:43,770
whole string contains of Commons and

694
00:35:43,770 --> 00:35:46,080
parameters for the columns so each

695
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:48,570
letter is a comment all the numbers

696
00:35:48,570 --> 00:35:50,850
comma separated or space separated after

697
00:35:50,850 --> 00:35:53,450
the letter our parameters of the common

698
00:35:53,450 --> 00:35:58,800
as easy so this is a comment in this

699
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:02,400
case it's move so we move our hand to

700
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:07,080
the particular particular x and y this

701
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:13,860
is X this is and this is why so capital

702
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:16,890
letters means it's absolutely moving

703
00:36:16,890 --> 00:36:19,670
lower case letters musn't relatively muy

704
00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:23,010
so you have here you have moved to X Y

705
00:36:23,010 --> 00:36:25,650
then draw a relative line to XY draw

706
00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:27,600
another relative line to X Y and so on

707
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:32,040
so far nobody asked you to read them so

708
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:34,440
let let me show you some demo of

709
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:40,690
actually usage of pathways

710
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:46,480
I have this PDF file on the screen

711
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:50,020
because a very recognizable icon right

712
00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:56,420
so let's open it with my favorite vector

713
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:58,339
driving problem this is vector icon for

714
00:36:58,339 --> 00:37:02,390
of Firefox longer simplified just for

715
00:37:02,390 --> 00:37:07,430
sake of this demo now let's save it as

716
00:37:07,430 --> 00:37:14,570
SVG right

717
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:17,440
ok

718
00:37:17,450 --> 00:37:21,180
now

719
00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:25,300
this is a test HTML this is a small HTML

720
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:30,010
I wrote just for this demo so it's

721
00:37:30,010 --> 00:37:32,260
basically just HTML which contains a

722
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:35,619
Raphael GS include and then some

723
00:37:35,619 --> 00:37:37,690
javascript which and Lord draw Raphael

724
00:37:37,690 --> 00:37:41,109
paper and then I will draw some pockets

725
00:37:41,109 --> 00:37:48,099
here let's find this file this is 54

726
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:55,119
stupid right so you can see here this is

727
00:37:55,119 --> 00:38:01,150
Frankie pocket already encoded here so

728
00:38:01,150 --> 00:38:02,970
you don't need to write it by hands

729
00:38:02,970 --> 00:38:07,119
unless you crazy I'll just like pain I

730
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:10,240
don't know but you could just grab it

731
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:12,430
from illustrator or inkscape or any

732
00:38:12,430 --> 00:38:20,050
vector any vector tool it supports let's

733
00:38:20,050 --> 00:38:23,980
support of SVG which is pretty much

734
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:26,950
everything so that I could add all the

735
00:38:26,950 --> 00:38:28,599
information here so give me the field

736
00:38:28,599 --> 00:38:30,940
color it could easily from this field

737
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:44,640
color here now I say this

738
00:38:44,650 --> 00:38:49,900
that's what I got right how easy with

739
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:54,160
that so have this path right here it's

740
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:57,609
vector zooming you want to do something

741
00:38:57,609 --> 00:38:59,170
cool about it okay let's do something

742
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:00,910
cool about it i don't know let's let's

743
00:39:00,910 --> 00:39:18,450
animate it I don't know

744
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:20,380
something like this something you

745
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:22,859
probably can't do with the images right

746
00:39:22,859 --> 00:39:26,560
so it's just a shot down over there so

747
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:29,859
like don't be scared by this path syntax

748
00:39:29,859 --> 00:39:31,599
because most of the time you don't

749
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:35,410
really need to use them but sometimes

750
00:39:35,410 --> 00:39:37,660
like when I draw the when even just need

751
00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:39,940
to draw the little twig see not the

752
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:42,640
whole thing then drawing Trixie I could

753
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:45,040
draw it of course with the string

754
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:46,510
methods instead of creating in

755
00:39:46,510 --> 00:39:55,180
Illustrator or something now obviously

756
00:39:55,180 --> 00:40:01,330
it's good library need plugins and you

757
00:40:01,330 --> 00:40:04,710
can create plugins for FL as well so

758
00:40:04,710 --> 00:40:08,770
again I still the syntax from jQuery so

759
00:40:08,770 --> 00:40:10,599
you can write ref held or the fan arrow

760
00:40:10,599 --> 00:40:12,760
and that's mean that paper object will

761
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:15,280
have the arrow method now and inside the

762
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:17,820
arrow method this is actually paper

763
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:19,869
titled around in context of the paper

764
00:40:19,869 --> 00:40:22,869
and you could draw some custom you know

765
00:40:22,869 --> 00:40:25,210
custom shape here for example if you

766
00:40:25,210 --> 00:40:27,700
need to use this arrow all the time you

767
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:29,230
just create a method and then just use

768
00:40:29,230 --> 00:40:33,040
paper to arrow boom boom boom you could

769
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:35,410
also add customer methods to the

770
00:40:35,410 --> 00:40:37,420
elements then you write our failed at l

771
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:39,700
and i create for example short card for

772
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:41,859
fuel and stroke instead of using ATT are

773
00:40:41,859 --> 00:40:44,349
all the time that makes just your

774
00:40:44,349 --> 00:40:45,730
development bit easier or you could

775
00:40:45,730 --> 00:40:47,349
create some rappelling pub then off

776
00:40:47,349 --> 00:40:49,030
he'll plugin in publish it there are

777
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:51,099
some plugins i really really want to

778
00:40:51,099 --> 00:40:53,430
create a plugin page in refugees com I

779
00:40:53,430 --> 00:40:57,040
just don't have a bloody time but i will

780
00:40:57,040 --> 00:41:00,790
good talking about plugins the one of

781
00:41:00,790 --> 00:41:04,270
the biggest plugins i wrote is the graph

782
00:41:04,270 --> 00:41:07,450
i owe to graph is the charting plugin

783
00:41:07,450 --> 00:41:10,180
for Rafael because everybody wants to

784
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:12,400
have charts from Raphael most of it

785
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:14,980
anything else so gravely charging

786
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:19,079
blogging let's take a peek

787
00:41:19,079 --> 00:41:26,730
Oh

788
00:41:26,740 --> 00:41:33,820
so this is the pie chart drawn by

789
00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:37,740
Raphael nothing really exciting let's

790
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:40,420
make really appreciate it but you have

791
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:47,940
to look at the source code for this ok

792
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:51,370
right shot

793
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:58,710
so

794
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:01,660
so here it comes so basically they align

795
00:42:01,660 --> 00:42:06,099
to create the pie chart of this you

796
00:42:06,099 --> 00:42:09,430
create you specify the coordinate width

797
00:42:09,430 --> 00:42:13,869
and height and radius well I mean x and

798
00:42:13,869 --> 00:42:15,970
y and radius and then you put an array

799
00:42:15,970 --> 00:42:19,300
of the values and it's great the pie

800
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:24,520
chart for you boring okay it's yeah it's

801
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:26,349
nice like it's nice to have a pie shop

802
00:42:26,349 --> 00:42:30,280
but what you really want to do is to add

803
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:35,380
some you know events to the pie chart so

804
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:39,700
let's add event for the hawa so when I

805
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:44,380
hover the sector this function will fire

806
00:42:44,380 --> 00:42:47,440
and this function will run in the

807
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:50,109
context of the object you have access to

808
00:42:50,109 --> 00:42:52,300
the sector so I could say this dot

809
00:42:52,300 --> 00:43:06,860
sector a GTR I know stroke black

810
00:43:06,870 --> 00:43:08,940
one climate

811
00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:14,010
let's do something useful okay what I

812
00:43:14,010 --> 00:43:17,839
want I want to create a drop here so

813
00:43:17,839 --> 00:43:20,609
graph a loss account not with just a

814
00:43:20,609 --> 00:43:23,339
charging stuff with some helpful methods

815
00:43:23,339 --> 00:43:26,819
like drop for example and when I say

816
00:43:26,819 --> 00:43:30,210
drop I want to show like a small pop-up

817
00:43:30,210 --> 00:43:32,250
with the value of this particular

818
00:43:32,250 --> 00:43:34,920
segment so let's say okay I know the

819
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:36,720
coordinates of the center of this

820
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:39,420
segment in the context object with the

821
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:44,869
max and this store why and please dot

822
00:43:44,869 --> 00:43:51,720
value it's really a bit more useful

823
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:58,140
right but not really totally correct so

824
00:43:58,140 --> 00:44:02,880
let's hide it so almost out I want

825
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:10,140
actually to

826
00:44:10,150 --> 00:44:15,369
remove it if it exists that's a bit bit

827
00:44:15,369 --> 00:44:17,109
better right you could see what the

828
00:44:17,109 --> 00:44:20,440
actual values for particular cases it's

829
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:23,740
a bit a bit not nice looking I mean it's

830
00:44:23,740 --> 00:44:27,329
a bit boring looking things so let's I

831
00:44:27,329 --> 00:44:34,390
actually know the angle I'm angle knows

832
00:44:34,390 --> 00:44:40,319
the angle of the of the second segment

833
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:44,260
yeah that's better right make it a bit

834
00:44:44,260 --> 00:44:46,480
more funky so you could make it as good

835
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:48,309
like there are lots of parameters there

836
00:44:48,309 --> 00:44:49,930
are lots of different things you could

837
00:44:49,930 --> 00:44:54,010
make it bigger if you wish to make it

838
00:44:54,010 --> 00:44:57,910
more visible you could replace the drop

839
00:44:57,910 --> 00:45:02,200
with I don't know pop up your pop

840
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:04,150
doesn't have angles will just give you

841
00:45:04,150 --> 00:45:11,440
this something like this you can do more

842
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:13,480
because it's you control what's

843
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:16,450
happening in mouse or you could draw you

844
00:45:16,450 --> 00:45:17,859
could draw pop up or you could actually

845
00:45:17,859 --> 00:45:19,779
access the context of the page and draw

846
00:45:19,779 --> 00:45:21,970
something using Raphael you know

847
00:45:21,970 --> 00:45:23,740
highlight the whole Sigma and Rho our

848
00:45:23,740 --> 00:45:26,500
arrow here draw something aloud

849
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:28,119
something change there he didn't input

850
00:45:28,119 --> 00:45:29,500
field in the different corner of the

851
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:32,740
page you decide what to do you handle

852
00:45:32,740 --> 00:45:34,869
the events it's done for developers not

853
00:45:34,869 --> 00:45:40,990
for psyche users right

854
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:45,920
so this is graffeo all the things that

855
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:48,050
open source all the things are free I

856
00:45:48,050 --> 00:45:50,450
forgot to mention that but if you wish

857
00:45:50,450 --> 00:45:52,870
to give me money I always glad to heaven

858
00:45:52,870 --> 00:45:58,820
I did it for my free time and I like to

859
00:45:58,820 --> 00:46:04,010
do this more and everyone can draw with

860
00:46:04,010 --> 00:46:06,380
Raphael nowadays right in all browsers

861
00:46:06,380 --> 00:46:09,260
you don't need to use flash well you had

862
00:46:09,260 --> 00:46:11,060
this flash when people saying Raphael is

863
00:46:11,060 --> 00:46:13,580
a flash killer I really glad to hear

864
00:46:13,580 --> 00:46:18,140
that not it's flash is not

865
00:46:18,140 --> 00:46:21,050
about to be killed by Raphael or SVG or

866
00:46:21,050 --> 00:46:24,800
html5 life has lots of things to compete

867
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:29,660
with but if you in depth what like if

868
00:46:29,660 --> 00:46:31,700
you have small project if you have like

869
00:46:31,700 --> 00:46:34,220
again like the Sprott corey google or

870
00:46:34,220 --> 00:46:36,530
yahoo pipes have this you know Vybz

871
00:46:36,530 --> 00:46:38,180
connecting the elements you want drag

872
00:46:38,180 --> 00:46:40,010
and drop around yeah you can go with

873
00:46:40,010 --> 00:46:44,570
flash you can write your own engine in

874
00:46:44,570 --> 00:46:47,120
cannabis use X canvas which is totally

875
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:51,710
wrong approach well canvass are in BML

876
00:46:51,710 --> 00:46:56,000
are very different things right or you

877
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,420
could use paper I fail for that and

878
00:46:58,420 --> 00:47:00,710
don't invent the wheel but you could

879
00:47:00,710 --> 00:47:02,480
invent everything which I invented find

880
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:06,230
all the rakes in the grass I found good

881
00:47:06,230 --> 00:47:10,880
luck I mean yeah it's fun it's painful

882
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:13,280
but it's kind of fun or you could just

883
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:15,290
use whatever I wrote and it's open

884
00:47:15,290 --> 00:47:16,730
source so you could contribute you could

885
00:47:16,730 --> 00:47:18,260
make it better you could nobody

886
00:47:18,260 --> 00:47:21,230
contributed so far much they woke up

887
00:47:21,230 --> 00:47:23,240
alone leave a couple of patches but they

888
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:26,330
were pretty much small I'm working alone

889
00:47:26,330 --> 00:47:29,150
so the Raphael team is bridging small

890
00:47:29,150 --> 00:47:32,000
and tight but we working hard to deliver

891
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,930
the best results for you

892
00:47:34,930 --> 00:47:40,990
and yeah you can draw if you go in

893
00:47:40,990 --> 00:47:43,420
topped open your mind web is not

894
00:47:43,420 --> 00:47:47,530
rectangle anymore okay make shapes make

895
00:47:47,530 --> 00:48:01,590
it make it rocks thank you very much

896
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:06,620
any questions Jesus yeah is it possible

897
00:48:06,620 --> 00:48:08,360
to us which one's the effects are

898
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:11,090
setting up the pages two possible resize

899
00:48:11,090 --> 00:48:12,510
obtained from

900
00:48:12,510 --> 00:48:19,690
resize the paper yes ha yeah yeah yeah I

901
00:48:19,690 --> 00:48:21,550
just didn't go through all API because

902
00:48:21,550 --> 00:48:26,680
it's yep Lori's yeah so I noticed on

903
00:48:26,680 --> 00:48:29,320
some of the path you were giving a

904
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:31,510
floating point but a lot of significant

905
00:48:31,510 --> 00:48:33,550
digits have you found like what the

906
00:48:33,550 --> 00:48:35,200
trade-off it is where you can still have

907
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:37,810
an SVG image that scales pretty nicely

908
00:48:37,810 --> 00:48:40,359
with a path well try to reduce the size

909
00:48:40,359 --> 00:48:45,790
of it well what again your question so

910
00:48:45,790 --> 00:48:47,380
you had some things where you're like go

911
00:48:47,380 --> 00:48:49,960
to dis X and this wide and it was like

912
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:52,900
you know one point and then three digits

913
00:48:52,900 --> 00:48:54,940
and so you had lots of minifigures can

914
00:48:54,940 --> 00:48:56,400
you reduce that so your overall

915
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:58,810
pastoring would be smaller but you still

916
00:48:58,810 --> 00:49:01,540
have a high quality image it depends it

917
00:49:01,540 --> 00:49:03,760
depends how big is your path so if you

918
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:08,020
pass this 32 by 32 icon it could be

919
00:49:08,020 --> 00:49:09,250
significant you could round it to

920
00:49:09,250 --> 00:49:12,760
integers you could see problems if you

921
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:16,869
pass that big like 800 800 pixels you

922
00:49:16,869 --> 00:49:18,609
could run to integer nobody will notice

923
00:49:18,609 --> 00:49:21,730
a difference it depends on the path when

924
00:49:21,730 --> 00:49:25,510
i create the map of Australia for real

925
00:49:25,510 --> 00:49:27,520
estate agents you ask me and I have it

926
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:29,619
as a demo and that's very nice because

927
00:49:29,619 --> 00:49:31,480
you know you know like you're going to

928
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:33,070
real estate agency and you have like in

929
00:49:33,070 --> 00:49:35,800
your case probably US map and you say

930
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:38,020
like to state and covering and the

931
00:49:38,020 --> 00:49:40,390
either use flash or image map or just

932
00:49:40,390 --> 00:49:44,470
looks dumb right so with the Rafael you

933
00:49:44,470 --> 00:49:47,859
could avoid using flash and make it

934
00:49:47,859 --> 00:49:51,190
works on ipad or you could just make it

935
00:49:51,190 --> 00:49:53,859
easier to implement because to use place

936
00:49:53,859 --> 00:49:55,089
you have to have pledged developing

937
00:49:55,089 --> 00:49:57,880
house if you have well awesome why why

938
00:49:57,880 --> 00:49:59,440
bother with Rafael but if you have just

939
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:01,330
JavaScript developer in house and don't

940
00:50:01,330 --> 00:50:03,010
have flash developer and you need to

941
00:50:03,010 --> 00:50:06,430
create something vector e Raphael could

942
00:50:06,430 --> 00:50:08,710
be a choice so in perth australia around

943
00:50:08,710 --> 00:50:12,490
it to 11 number of the dr dot what's

944
00:50:12,490 --> 00:50:14,710
good just integers was a bit dodgy on

945
00:50:14,710 --> 00:50:24,770
the edges one number was a kid yes

946
00:50:24,780 --> 00:50:28,660
it's called monitor and it's called

947
00:50:28,660 --> 00:50:31,660
eurofurence it's two phones which comes

948
00:50:31,660 --> 00:50:45,880
together very nice

949
00:50:45,890 --> 00:50:49,510
yes

950
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:52,260
hey

951
00:50:52,260 --> 00:50:54,700
well Raphael is basically it's two

952
00:50:54,700 --> 00:50:58,900
scripts BML and SVG implementation they

953
00:50:58,900 --> 00:51:01,780
are absolutely totally different and

954
00:51:01,780 --> 00:51:06,280
don't share anything pretty much later

955
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:07,900
on generic functions like parts Cola

956
00:51:07,900 --> 00:51:11,710
parse path but in general they were way

957
00:51:11,710 --> 00:51:14,349
different a lot of things in SVG which I

958
00:51:14,349 --> 00:51:16,359
would like to implement bike on because

959
00:51:16,359 --> 00:51:18,670
BML has lots of limitations the

960
00:51:18,670 --> 00:51:21,849
gradients is the best example in vml you

961
00:51:21,849 --> 00:51:24,069
can't have radial gradient on anything

962
00:51:24,069 --> 00:51:28,990
but Alex it's very useful and you can't

963
00:51:28,990 --> 00:51:32,920
put it it's a bug when you add radial

964
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:34,630
gradients you have rectangular gradient

965
00:51:34,630 --> 00:51:36,880
if you understand what I mean it's not

966
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:39,460
actually radio and even on the custom

967
00:51:39,460 --> 00:51:42,369
path its rectangular I don't know work

968
00:51:42,369 --> 00:51:44,140
around as soon as I found they will put

969
00:51:44,140 --> 00:51:46,390
the page but so far I have no idea how

970
00:51:46,390 --> 00:51:47,829
to work around it so this is limitation

971
00:51:47,829 --> 00:51:50,470
of Raphael there are the limitation you

972
00:51:50,470 --> 00:51:52,480
can't specify you could specify as many

973
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:54,579
colors ingredient but you only could

974
00:51:54,579 --> 00:51:57,279
specify one ampacity at the end you can

975
00:51:57,279 --> 00:52:00,279
specify multiple opacities in SE g you

976
00:52:00,279 --> 00:52:04,599
can and in everywhere you can in vml you

977
00:52:04,599 --> 00:52:08,020
can't it's just there no even way it's

978
00:52:08,020 --> 00:52:10,119
not on the bug just API doesn't allow

979
00:52:10,119 --> 00:52:15,970
you there no way why

980
00:52:15,980 --> 00:52:18,200
I don't know maybe it's useful for some

981
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:20,030
you know Microsoft engineers maybe they

982
00:52:20,030 --> 00:52:21,410
found it all this will be useful for

983
00:52:21,410 --> 00:52:28,070
people so thank you very much for more
