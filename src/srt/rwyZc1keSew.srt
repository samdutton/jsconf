Ben Schwarz Real world connectivity - Beyond
the bubble

2
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:08,109
>> One did my favourite things about both
JSConf and CSSConf is this warm and fuzzy

3
00:00:08,109 --> 00:00:09,109
feeling you get when you come here, like a
family reunion without the bad parts!

4
00:00:09,109 --> 00:00:10,109
I love that.

5
00:00:10,109 --> 00:00:11,109
I've been coming for I think four years, and
every single time, it is even more amazing,

6
00:00:11,109 --> 00:00:12,109
and more people are getting into this nice
family of ours.

7
00:00:12,109 --> 00:00:13,109
Ben is a really good example of that.

8
00:00:13,109 --> 00:00:14,109
He not only runs JSConf back in Australia,
but he's been coming here for three or four

9
00:00:14,109 --> 00:00:15,109
years.

10
00:00:15,109 --> 00:00:16,109
He mc'ed two of them, and now he's speaking
so it comes around.

11
00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:17,109
You can end up attending and then speaking,
which is really great.

12
00:00:17,109 --> 00:00:18,109
You can be on the stage.

13
00:00:18,109 --> 00:00:19,109
Yes, Ben is from Melbourne in Australia which
is a great city.

14
00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:20,109
I lived there, too.

15
00:00:20,109 --> 00:00:21,109
He's a founder of Calibre which is a web-performance
monitoring tool and he will tell you about

16
00:00:21,109 --> 00:00:22,109
the state of connectivity, the state of the
internet and what we can do for people to

17
00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:23,109
make the internet and web faster for them.

18
00:00:23,109 --> 00:00:29,540
Please give a really washing welcome to Ben
Schwarz.

19
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:30,540
[Applause].

20
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:31,870
BEN: Hello!

21
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:33,309
How are we doing?

22
00:00:33,309 --> 00:00:35,530
Doing good?

23
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:40,289
My mother doesn't know what I do, so this
isn't going to help her, but if everyone can

24
00:00:40,289 --> 00:00:44,460
just yell "ya" as I come around, okay?

25
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:45,960
AUDIENCE: Ya.

26
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:50,039
BEN: Mum ... I don't know!

27
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:51,039
[Laughter].

28
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:53,809
That was fun.

29
00:00:53,809 --> 00:00:55,110
My name is Ben Schwarz.

30
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:58,309
I'm from Melbourne, Australia.

31
00:00:58,309 --> 00:01:03,269
I've been coming here for a few years and
it's my favourite conference anywhere in the

32
00:01:03,269 --> 00:01:05,080
world to come.

33
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:07,390
It is a huge privilege.

34
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:11,670
Thanks for everyone for making it great for
me to be here.

35
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:18,740
My talk today is called "Beyond the Bubble"
and I hope to achieve, to give you some context

36
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:28,320
that maybe you haven't maybe necessarily considered
as part of your day jobs.

37
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,280
When we usually talk about performance, we
talk about how quickly pages load, we talk

38
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:38,939
about how much money Amazon made when they
made something half a second faster, but often,

39
00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:44,509
that's kind of really as far as we go, I think
is really sad because performance is a pillar

40
00:01:44,509 --> 00:01:49,470
of user experience, and yet every aspect of
performance work we are doing right now seems

41
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:51,880
to be a bit of an afterthought.

42
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:57,270
Sites are often deployed to production, and
then we say all right, let's see how this

43
00:01:57,270 --> 00:01:58,369
performance.

44
00:01:58,369 --> 00:02:04,400
And if the result are disappointing, then
maybe do our best to see what we can do.

45
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:09,060
But often we have to just move on because
there isn't the time and budget, and nobody

46
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:13,970
is really committed to it by that point.

47
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:18,860
And we are still, when we're doing this, when
we're building the sites and apps and these

48
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:22,940
experiences, we are doing doing using a $3,000
dollar computer or a $1,000 phone and you're

49
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:24,470
doing it on localhost.

50
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:30,130
Of course it is going to be fast.

51
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:34,400
I think it is our -- doing it on localhost.

52
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:40,470
I am the founder of a company called Calibre,
a recently young company.

53
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:44,390
It is so young, in fact, that I'm the only
person in the company.

54
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:47,010
I do everything.

55
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:49,320
What that really means is I'm full-time now.

56
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:58,580
I became full-time in January, and ultimately,
that means that every day, I am helping to

57
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:05,150
build tools to make the web faster, or helping
to try to contribute to that, or I'm doing

58
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:07,940
audits for people, or I'm diving in stack
traces.

59
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:11,790
I'm kind of doing that performance work that
you would maybe do if you had the time, but

60
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:13,610
that's all I'm doing right now.

61
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:18,210
I hope through that you will maybe enjoy the
talk ahead.

62
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:26,340
So, I thought it would be really interesting
look at somewhere where time really equalled

63
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:34,590
money, and in the last 30 years, we've been
trying to reduce latency between locations,

64
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:43,950
but somewhere it was really hyperfocused was
in the stock changes between Chicago and New

65
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:45,990
York.

66
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:53,090
Every few milliseconds you save or make literally
billions of dollars.

67
00:03:53,090 --> 00:04:02,330
In the made 1980s, the round-trip latency
was 14 and a half milliseconds, cut by a millisecond

68
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:11,861
and a half in 2010 by shortening the physical
fibre route they took.

69
00:04:11,861 --> 00:04:22,060
They thought this is too slow and we will
do something else.

70
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:26,030
[Sound cut] you see that large tower there.

71
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:31,000
That's a microwave tower.

72
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,790
These towers - using these towers, they were
able to get that connection speed right down

73
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:44,510
to 4.2 milliseconds which is a huge improvements,
three times over where we started in the 1980s.

74
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:49,680
Interestingly enough, when these towers were
constructed, they were buying up little plots

75
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:55,580
of farmland and between, and I think some
of these towers they actually had to pay these

76
00:04:55,580 --> 00:05:02,230
farmers - in the regions of $500 million just
to put a tower there.

77
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:06,861
I think that's particularly interesting because
I think when we are building sites and apps

78
00:05:06,861 --> 00:05:12,740
and throwing them in a browser and we are
delivering this HTML, right, and, as you saw

79
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:18,280
in the previous talk, we are getting better
at detecting the resources on the page and

80
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:27,620
pre-getting them, but up to now, what we've
been doing is this: we're just throwing things

81
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:28,910
at the customer.

82
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:32,430
Saying take it all, I don't care about you.

83
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:38,380
Whether on a tiny phone with a slow CPU, or
maybe you've used all your data plan, like

84
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:43,389
I have in Berlin already in a week, we're
not doing enough here.

85
00:05:43,389 --> 00:05:53,350
I'm going to take you through some stats about
the state of global connectivity.

86
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:58,220
Right now, there are 7.4 billion people on
the planet.

87
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:02,550
46 per cent of them have access to the internet.

88
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:07,080
That means that we are actually at a point
where there are four billion people who don't

89
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:09,270
have any access to the internet at all.

90
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:10,790
We're only halfway there.

91
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:14,200
We're not even halfway there yet.

92
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:20,700
So why don't we have an a look at how quickly
the internet is growing, and if you were thinking

93
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:27,130
maybe Europe is getting better connectivity,
maybe it's US, 300 million people there, may

94
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:31,620
be it is in Australia where I'm from, and
really trying to build a faster internet,

95
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:41,360
but struggling, it isn't really sort of in
that bubble that we are in right now today.

96
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:48,060
If you look at India just last year, their
internet users grew by 108 million people,

97
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:55,400
which, in case you were wondering, that's
more than the population of Germany.

98
00:06:55,400 --> 00:07:02,150
This is 30 per cent year on year from the
year previously.

99
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:06,870
If those numbers are matched again this year,
that will be 140 million people.

100
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:14,720
Airtel, who are the largest carrier, have
255 million customers, people who just have

101
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:23,169
a phone plan, and this stat, the last time
I researched it, it's gone up by 5 million

102
00:07:23,169 --> 00:07:31,290
subscribers, and their share has fallen from
32 per cent of the marketplace.

103
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:35,640
Truly, truly incredible numbers.

104
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:47,150
In India only 635 per cent 1.2 billion don't
have access to the internet, so that means

105
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:52,040
that's 864 million people who are yet to get
the internet.

106
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,680
They're about to.

107
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:57,360
That's essential lit population of China again.

108
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:04,550
I took time to look at what data costs in
different locations.

109
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:10,780
The way that I came up with these numbers
here is I took a pre-paid plan, which is usually

110
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:18,200
cheaper than a post-paid plan, and I took
the minimum wage of these countries, and I

111
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:21,780
calculated how many hours would you have to
work just to get 500megs of data.

112
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:29,720
In India, it is it is 17 hours, but in Germany,
it is less than one hour.

113
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:36,349
Our, let's call it, data addiction isn't met
with the same enthusiasm in other places in

114
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:37,349
the world.

115
00:08:37,349 --> 00:08:40,579
Could I get some water?

116
00:08:40,579 --> 00:08:42,469
Thank you.

117
00:08:42,469 --> 00:08:48,790
That could be one hour for eight songs on
Spotify, six minutes of YouTube, and less

118
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:55,879
than an hour playing games.

119
00:08:55,879 --> 00:09:09,390
Or you can go to the Burj, empty your cache
and hit reload 28 times.

120
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:15,850
Even if you can afford the internet, you're
not necessarily going to get fast internet

121
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:17,540
all the time.

122
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:22,240
Back in Melbourne last year, I lived on the
wrong side of the street to get cable connection

123
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:26,850
so I ended up having DSL and it was a lot
slower than it should have been.

124
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:32,260
Even if you have LTE advertise the on your
phone, you may not get the same LTE speeds.

125
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:43,660
In Singapore, the average is capping out at
about 50 which is super great, but in India,

126
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:45,459
it is doing 6.39Mbit/s.

127
00:09:45,459 --> 00:09:50,319
It's no matter where you are in the world.

128
00:09:50,319 --> 00:09:56,309
I had a look at the German internet plans
because I'm Australian, and it's very different

129
00:09:56,309 --> 00:09:57,309
here.

130
00:09:57,309 --> 00:10:02,540
I Shaw that there are 400 Mbit connections.

131
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:09,660
Over the year if it worked out to EUR30 a
month.

132
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:18,389
Put that on a global scale, does anyone want
to guess where the global average for connection

133
00:10:18,389 --> 00:10:19,389
speed would be?

134
00:10:19,389 --> 00:10:21,029
Shout out numbers?

135
00:10:21,029 --> 00:10:22,529
Two?

136
00:10:22,529 --> 00:10:24,029
50?

137
00:10:24,029 --> 00:10:25,529
50.

138
00:10:25,529 --> 00:10:27,029
Okay.

139
00:10:27,029 --> 00:10:31,050
It is actually seven.

140
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:33,350
This is the global average.

141
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:38,660
So this is, it is pulled down by some places
and pulled up by others.

142
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:43,810
I thought maybe we could look at the mobile
speed.

143
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:51,269
In Canada, which is covering the Americas
region, the best average, or the highest average

144
00:10:51,269 --> 00:10:53,449
speed is 10.3.

145
00:10:53,449 --> 00:10:57,850
In Australia, for Asia-Pacific, 13.

146
00:10:57,850 --> 00:11:06,029
For the United Kingdom, Europe, it was 26.8
- [Laughter] - and the UAE for the Middle

147
00:11:06,029 --> 00:11:10,999
East and Africa region was 17.2.

148
00:11:10,999 --> 00:11:12,550
But it goes further than that.

149
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:20,180
60 per cent of all but global mobile connections
are actually 2G.

150
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:25,670
So we know that, even if you do have LTE,
you can't really assume it's going to be fast.

151
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:29,850
On average, we're only doing 7Mbit a second.

152
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:32,629
Let's look at devices.

153
00:11:32,629 --> 00:11:36,860
Most devices on the web are handsets.

154
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:39,369
This has been the case since 2014.

155
00:11:39,369 --> 00:11:41,689
I thought maybe I would have a look.

156
00:11:41,689 --> 00:11:45,481
I have an iPhone in my pocket, and I'm sure
a lot of you do too, and maybe use an android,

157
00:11:45,481 --> 00:11:47,250
and that is cool too.

158
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:51,170
Have you thought of devices that people use
in other locations?

159
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:57,509
Here are the top five devices for three regions.

160
00:11:57,509 --> 00:12:04,899
China had three phones I had never heard of,
and they were selling enough devices to cover

161
00:12:04,899 --> 00:12:10,860
the population of my country multiple times
over a year, so that's reasonably significant.

162
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:17,249
The I don't know hands in India is corresponding
to its very mixed market but it is a big collection

163
00:12:17,249 --> 00:12:18,249
of devices.

164
00:12:18,249 --> 00:12:29,699
So, I got to wondering, is there a single
device that best represents average?

165
00:12:29,699 --> 00:12:33,550
If we need to - we know that these devices
are super, super different.

166
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:39,209
How do we test this and understand what to
do next?

167
00:12:39,209 --> 00:12:42,579
Thanks to our friends at Google, there's been
some research done into this.

168
00:12:42,579 --> 00:12:49,259
At the moment today, if you were to take a
fairly average phone, it is not super expensive,

169
00:12:49,259 --> 00:12:54,829
I think in Germany, it is EUR180 if you were
to go and buy one won you would end up with

170
00:12:54,829 --> 00:12:59,910
a quad core CPU, decent amount of storage.

171
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:06,739
This isn't the slow phone that people will
tell you in talks you have to think about

172
00:13:06,739 --> 00:13:09,559
these other people, this is a pretty middle-of-the-road
phobe.

173
00:13:09,559 --> 00:13:13,060
It is not the fastest and it is not the slowest.

174
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:17,269
If you average out global devices, this is
where you will end up.

175
00:13:17,269 --> 00:13:18,749
Has really great.

176
00:13:18,749 --> 00:13:24,910
You can test them on web page tests, and they
have these devices in data centres around

177
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:27,830
the world.

178
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:30,899
Let's say you didn't have access to a device.

179
00:13:30,899 --> 00:13:32,990
Here's what you can do.

180
00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:41,199
Go into your current dev tools.

181
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:42,439
Click on the timeline.

182
00:13:42,439 --> 00:13:46,279
Click on "capture settings" CPU, drag it down
to 5.

183
00:13:46,279 --> 00:13:51,529
I know 5 is seemingly an abstract number,
but if you're on a recent Macbook Pro, you

184
00:13:51,529 --> 00:13:55,079
will end up with the speed of about a MotoG4.

185
00:13:55,079 --> 00:14:01,069
There's been research done into this, and
you can calibrate your device, but if you're

186
00:14:01,069 --> 00:14:05,950
looking for a close enough experience, that's
where you should end up.

187
00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:08,509
5x slowdown.

188
00:14:08,509 --> 00:14:14,269
What is clear after we've looked at connectivity
and devises is there aren't any context.

189
00:14:14,269 --> 00:14:19,220
If you go for a proper average, it changes
daily.

190
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:25,279
I like to think that there are two versions
of the internet.

191
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:29,629
There's the one that we use - us - and then
there's one that we usually don't.

192
00:14:29,629 --> 00:14:34,679
I've been experiencing a little bit of the
column B in the last couple of weeks here

193
00:14:34,679 --> 00:14:41,410
in Germany, and the aeroplane Wi-Fi I think
at times was better than the Airbnb I have

194
00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:43,199
at the moment.

195
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:50,350
The conference Wi-Fi hasn't been too bad - thanks
for doing OK on that, JSConf - and Lie-fi

196
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:57,779
when it says you're on Wi-Fi and nothing happens.

197
00:14:57,779 --> 00:15:00,981
We know that the connections vary and it might
be that because you're at the wrong end of

198
00:15:00,981 --> 00:15:06,860
the building, and too many brick walls, or
for whatever fucking reason, your modem needs

199
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:08,119
restarting again.

200
00:15:08,119 --> 00:15:10,499
It happens, I understand.

201
00:15:10,499 --> 00:15:21,829
One thing is clear, we need to stop optimising
for $3,000 computer with fast connections.

202
00:15:21,829 --> 00:15:26,189
Inconsistency is a major property of the web
in general, but now that we are understanding

203
00:15:26,189 --> 00:15:33,480
that we are in a global landscape, it is time
that we started by about what we are delivering

204
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:40,089
to people so we should gather knowledge and
build with more understanding and empty.

205
00:15:40,089 --> 00:15:46,360
Looking beyond the delivery of an asset or
looking how an asset is put down on to a device,

206
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:52,070
we are generally looking at three things:
delivery, so this is the time where we are

207
00:15:52,070 --> 00:15:53,839
saying how many scripts are there on this
page?

208
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:54,839
How big are they?

209
00:15:54,839 --> 00:15:55,930
What do they look like?

210
00:15:55,930 --> 00:16:00,259
There is the pass cycle.

211
00:16:00,259 --> 00:16:04,950
This is when the browser gets those assets,
and it has to figure out something.

212
00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:11,249
Maybe it has to decompress the G zip on a
resource, maybe it has to parse and compile

213
00:16:11,249 --> 00:16:16,949
the JavaScript, maybe it has to get an image
and then composite it before it actually paints

214
00:16:16,949 --> 00:16:20,089
it.

215
00:16:20,089 --> 00:16:22,350
The last part of that is run time.

216
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:25,910
These three phases of performance that we
should worry about.

217
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:32,639
Runtime is actually the actual run time that
we are giving smooth, fluid animations and

218
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:36,100
making it responsive to a user input.

219
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:39,259
But unfortunately at the moment, the one rear
really forgetting this is parse time.

220
00:16:39,259 --> 00:16:44,859
We're throwing down scripts at the browser
and we're just hoping for the best.

221
00:16:44,859 --> 00:16:52,350
This wonderful graphic is taken from a brilliant
blog post called JavaScript start-up time

222
00:16:52,350 --> 00:17:00,730
and a rough how V8 works or more like, the
V8 people tell me, how it will work really

223
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:02,209
soon.

224
00:17:02,209 --> 00:17:10,069
This varies from engine to engine, but they
take your JS, they generate byte code, do

225
00:17:10,069 --> 00:17:16,380
optimisation stuff, and then they build it
for your architecture.

226
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:22,289
When you're taking the 410 average script
size, this is the average across the web,

227
00:17:22,289 --> 00:17:23,289
right?

228
00:17:23,289 --> 00:17:24,899
This is what we are on average setting.

229
00:17:24,899 --> 00:17:33,710
There's been the argument that maybe we can
reduce that size, just remove a jpeg - I won't

230
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:38,720
name names - but this became a bit of a popular
thing to say a couple of years ago, but I

231
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:43,899
tell you why it's wrong.

232
00:17:43,899 --> 00:17:44,919
Forget 410kb.

233
00:17:44,919 --> 00:17:47,840
When you decompress, it could be three to
four megabytes.

234
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:55,409
It is the three to four megabytes that your
phone has to understand, compile.

235
00:17:55,409 --> 00:18:01,450
I took the JSConf site which is really light,
whoever worked on it didn't have to do much

236
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:10,059
stuff to make a pretty website to tell you
about the conference - it only had 57KB-of-scripts,

237
00:18:10,059 --> 00:18:22,980
jQuery, some web stats and a tiny 1kb.

238
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:30,360
When I bench marked it on desktop, this one,
and a MotoG4, I found that the script time,

239
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:35,360
all I'm dealing is loading the page, and we
are spending three times the amount of time

240
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:39,299
just in scripting.

241
00:18:39,299 --> 00:18:40,580
Why is that important?

242
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:45,539
It is important because this is happening
in the JavaScript main thread.

243
00:18:45,539 --> 00:18:49,919
This is also blogging Paint, and in these
are all the little things that make your website

244
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:56,320
feel when you're also contending with web
fonts loading, and disappearing, and a different

245
00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:01,380
one appears, and a user is controlling, and
then an image loads and then that pops back

246
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:03,870
up - you've all even is, right?

247
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:05,250
We are suspect to it.

248
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:12,160
I look the Lufthansa site this this is the
mobile site.

249
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:16,690
This is probably reasonably optimised.

250
00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:21,090
On average, a little bit bigger than other
stuff.

251
00:19:21,090 --> 00:19:26,600
And it actually compressed really, really
well, and, again, well, it was double.

252
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,570
It doesn't mean that these numbers are completely
linear.

253
00:19:28,570 --> 00:19:32,220
You can't say that it's going to be 600kB.

254
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:34,169
You do need to test that stuff.

255
00:19:34,169 --> 00:19:36,389
I did start testing.

256
00:19:36,389 --> 00:19:41,620
Let's do an experiment here.

257
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:45,429
Maybe I can just say, "Delete all of your
JavaScript".

258
00:19:45,429 --> 00:19:49,480
You might not like that be.

259
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:51,040
So I took the Guardian's website.

260
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:52,799
They've done some fantastic work.

261
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:59,820
Patrick Hammond who is here spoke two years
ago at CSSConf, and he showed all the really

262
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:02,639
great work he's done at the Guardian.

263
00:20:02,639 --> 00:20:07,590
I don't want to bash it up too much, but I'm
going to show you something.

264
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:10,039
This is the Guardian loading side by side.

265
00:20:10,039 --> 00:20:18,289
On the left, we have it without JavaScript
and on the right, we have it with.

266
00:20:18,289 --> 00:20:25,430
The version on the left was completely visible
in under 5 seconds on a 3G connection - bang,

267
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:27,360
done.

268
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:31,740
The other side: well, there is the fonts,
switching, loading.

269
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:35,880
The weather appeared and then a related article
appeared at the bottom of the screen and it

270
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:40,180
stopped rendering somewhere around the 22-second
mark.

271
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:44,370
Unfortunately, the 22-second mark is about
the average.

272
00:20:44,370 --> 00:20:47,070
The average for this is about 17 seconds.

273
00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:48,519
This is not a bad website.

274
00:20:48,519 --> 00:20:51,610
This is very, very normal.

275
00:20:51,610 --> 00:20:56,630
It goes further too.

276
00:20:56,630 --> 00:21:01,990
Of the difference between the requests, and
it wasn't all JavaScript, it was images and

277
00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:09,159
assets and other stuff, we, with JavaScript,
it was 3.4 megabytes, 115 requests, otherwise

278
00:21:09,159 --> 00:21:14,580
1.59 and 61 requests.

279
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:18,820
I think that's a lot just to show people a
related article and whether and different

280
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:23,980
[sound cut] but we didn't really improve it.

281
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:40,679
We talk about progressive enhancement [sound
cut] one thing that I've really noticed this

282
00:21:40,679 --> 00:21:51,860
that the metrics we're currently - I think
they are the important part.

283
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:58,160
Metrics like unload, on DOM-content loaded
which is everything ready, DOM ready, and

284
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:09,360
speed index which is my particular favourite
to have a little go at.

285
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:21,820
I know people who put "MS" after it so that
is looks ... good metrics try to aim something.

286
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:25,279
Here are some examples of good metrics.

287
00:22:25,279 --> 00:22:28,940
Has 19 heard of them?

288
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:30,330
Any of them, all of them?

289
00:22:30,330 --> 00:22:35,409
I'm going to explain a little bit about what
they are.

290
00:22:35,409 --> 00:22:41,470
The user navigates.

291
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:42,470
We have a first paint.

292
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:46,309
The first paint is when we see anything a
wide screen.

293
00:22:46,309 --> 00:22:51,409
We go on, render a little bit more.

294
00:22:51,409 --> 00:22:56,180
Then we have some more graphic starting to
appear, the font hasn't uploaded yet, and

295
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:58,690
then we get to a point where we get the meaningful
paint.

296
00:22:58,690 --> 00:23:05,550
That means that the text is visible, somebody
did see something readable approximately visually

297
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:14,320
complete means when the area in the view port
is fully resolved, let's call it.

298
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:19,450
That's great.

299
00:23:19,450 --> 00:23:21,200
Visually complete is a difficult one.

300
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:27,529
It is not something that you do get out of
dev tools, so how can we produce these metrics

301
00:23:27,529 --> 00:23:30,320
and actually get something out of it.

302
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:36,169
Thankfully, there's a tool called Lighthouse
built by the Google Chrome team which comes

303
00:23:36,169 --> 00:23:39,340
as a browser extension.

304
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:43,250
And you can just go to a website, click on
it, generate a report.

305
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:52,130
It loads the site by default in nexus 5x,
I think, and it slows the CPU down, it checks

306
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:58,590
it in an offline mode, it will give you some
stats with how it's performing as a progressive

307
00:23:58,590 --> 00:24:08,740
web app, accessibility stuff request and best
practices.

308
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:09,740
That's really great.

309
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:17,370
I have a little secret though: can we keep
this between us?

310
00:24:17,370 --> 00:24:18,779
Yes.

311
00:24:18,779 --> 00:24:23,470
As of Thursday, Lighthouse dropped into Google
Chrome can nary.

312
00:24:23,470 --> 00:24:26,929
I will show you how to get this now.

313
00:24:26,929 --> 00:24:35,590
You need the latest Chrome Canary and animate,
I imagine.

314
00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:41,370
You need to go to the chrome Flags page, search
for dev tools experiments and turn that on.

315
00:24:41,370 --> 00:24:43,820
Then relaunch your browser - this is quite
a step.

316
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:49,800
Go to the thing that you want, and pop up
your dev tools, go to the settings down here,

317
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:53,580
over to the experiments, you don't see it,
right?

318
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:54,580
See how it appeared.

319
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:56,539
You have to hit shift.

320
00:24:56,539 --> 00:24:58,809
It's a little secret.

321
00:24:58,809 --> 00:25:01,740
Then they appear, all those things that you
didn't know were there.

322
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:03,490
Then you have to turn it on.

323
00:25:03,490 --> 00:25:04,490
Close it.

324
00:25:04,490 --> 00:25:07,029
Open it again, and audits two will appear.

325
00:25:07,029 --> 00:25:14,950
Then you get a lighthouse button and you can
choose the audits that you want to do and

326
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:17,970
you will get some idea of the performance
of your browser.

327
00:25:17,970 --> 00:25:23,600
I'm not sure when this is going to reach stable
but they're working hard on it Google IOs

328
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:29,740
in a week and a half and the guys have been
worked really, really half.

329
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:32,500
First meaningful paint, visually complete.

330
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:37,770
I'm going to talk to you about a what this
other metric we've heard a little bit about

331
00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:38,770
is.

332
00:25:38,770 --> 00:25:41,389
It is time to visually complete.

333
00:25:41,389 --> 00:25:43,770
This is how they're calculating it now in
lighthouse.

334
00:25:43,770 --> 00:25:47,480
I think it is really, really cool.

335
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:53,331
We watch the timeline and we figure out when
the browser is visually complete, and then

336
00:25:53,331 --> 00:25:58,990
we are watching the JavaScript main thread,and
we're watching the sub tasks that are happening,

337
00:25:58,990 --> 00:26:01,570
looking for them that are shorter than 50
milliseconds.

338
00:26:01,570 --> 00:26:11,720
We figure out when there is a five-second
window without a long Taft, task.

339
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:19,490
The reason we do that because time to interactive
is a really good way of getting that empathy

340
00:26:19,490 --> 00:26:23,919
for a user that it's not popping around the
web fonts nor and it's not jumping up and

341
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:27,570
down and going all over the place.

342
00:26:27,570 --> 00:26:33,451
Your target for every device, and I'm talking
about the phones in your pockets is to get

343
00:26:33,451 --> 00:26:38,519
it in under five seconds.

344
00:26:38,519 --> 00:26:44,909
Even better come up with the Twitter team
do having a metric of time to first Tweet.

345
00:26:44,909 --> 00:26:47,789
They've been doing it for years.

346
00:26:47,789 --> 00:26:53,529
Trying to find ways of understanding how your
users are using your apps and sites and get

347
00:26:53,529 --> 00:26:54,750
a metric and track it.

348
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:57,690
Because it doesn't matter when unload happens.

349
00:26:57,690 --> 00:27:00,700
It is totally irrelevant.

350
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:03,070
Don't try and keep people on your side for
as long as possible.

351
00:27:03,070 --> 00:27:08,740
Help them get to their goals and do it quickly
so they can do something else which is far

352
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:09,740
better.

353
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:14,629
I know that the performance landscape is realising
fast and so many bits and pieces to worry

354
00:27:14,629 --> 00:27:16,009
about.

355
00:27:16,009 --> 00:27:19,640
My advice is to pick one or two and give them
a shot.

356
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:25,240
All of these things that are on the screen
here, using a CDN, like weapon P, the purple

357
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:31,120
pattern, all of these will improve website
performance, give one of them a go, test it,

358
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,529
measure it and improve.

359
00:27:32,529 --> 00:27:38,279
If you're wondering where I got the stats
from, they are from the State of the Internet

360
00:27:38,279 --> 00:27:39,279
report?

361
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:41,440
Has anyone seen this before?

362
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,379
Like ten people, I think.

363
00:27:43,379 --> 00:27:52,790
It is a quarterly report put out, so, all
my data is from Q42016, and it is just a pdf

364
00:27:52,790 --> 00:27:53,790
report.

365
00:27:53,790 --> 00:27:56,879
You can see what the global averages are.

366
00:27:56,879 --> 00:28:04,679
The global average for connection speed went
from 62M/bit per second to the 7.

367
00:28:04,679 --> 00:28:08,340
We are improving but it is very slow.

368
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:14,509
We've been focused on the wealthy Western
web for so long, we're building for the machines

369
00:28:14,509 --> 00:28:17,780
we're using, but that's bullshit.

370
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:18,780
We didn't sign up for that.

371
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:20,799
We signed up for the World Wide Web.

372
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:26,429
I want to encourage you to make the web faster,
everyone.

373
00:28:26,429 --> 00:28:30,210
That's what I'm trying to do at Calibre, and
that's what I'm dedicating all my work to

374
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:32,399
at the moment.

375
00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:34,350
Hopefully, you can get Calibre, give it a
shot.

376
00:28:34,350 --> 00:28:35,919
If you don't, try Lighthouse, that's great.

377
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:38,190
Otherwise, if you want stickers, come and
see me or something.

378
00:28:38,190 --> 00:28:39,190
It will be cool.

379
00:28:39,190 --> 00:28:40,190
Thanks a lot.

380
00:28:40,190 --> 00:28:41,190
[Applause].

381
00:28:41,190 --> 00:28:43,129
>> You have literally 60 seconds to get coffee
or snacks.

382
00:28:43,129 --> 00:28:44,129
Run!

383
00:28:44,129 --> 00:28:45,129
Are we ready?
