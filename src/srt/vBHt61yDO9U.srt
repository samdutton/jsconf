1
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:12,630

yeah pretty good

2
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:16,500
everybody had good lunch alright so as

3
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,300
Jen mentioned my name is Angelina

4
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:21,180
Favreau I hail from Vancouver Canada as

5
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:22,560
opposed to Vancouver Washington which

6
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,600
I'm sure many of you are from I'm

7
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,070
Angelina Magnum on Twitter feel free to

8
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:27,780
say hi for example if there's something

9
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:29,100
that I covered in the talk that you have

10
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:30,870
a question about or if you happen to

11
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:33,000
have some mobile inch cases that you

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,410
think I might find interesting

13
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:36,270
I'm more than happy to talk to you about

14
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:42,480
those things so Mobile's a thing it's

15
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,430
pretty important thing it just kind of

16
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:46,079
like throw some media queries into a

17
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:47,850
page and then you're basically done

18
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:50,790
right basically need to focus on maybe

19
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:54,000
one browser two browsers that's it okay

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,550
so there is a big problem I think with

21
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:57,750
mobile development and that's that

22
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:00,360
actually there are a lot of really good

23
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:02,610
tools but later in the talk you'll

24
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:05,100
actually see why this is a problem and

25
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:07,620
my personal problem is that no one tool

26
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:09,900
actually solves all of my problems for

27
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:11,820
me when I'm doing mobile application

28
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:13,200
development or mobile website

29
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,850
development depending on how you decide

30
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:17,420
to frame your paradigm of development so

31
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:20,310
in my mind whenever I'm dealing with CSS

32
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:21,960
there are two types of debugging that

33
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:24,540
I'm dealing with layout debugging or I'm

34
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:26,070
dealing with performance debugging those

35
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:27,720
are the things I care about Louis and

36
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,159
when I'm thinking about debugging tasks

37
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:30,900
i compartmentalize them into one of

38
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:32,190
those two things it's not always black

39
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:33,049
and white

40
00:01:33,049 --> 00:01:37,530
but for now let's pretend it is so today

41
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:38,880
I'm going to talk to you about a little

42
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,299
bit to do what I do for my workflow when

43
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:44,640
I'm developing a mobile responsive

44
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,729
website in the past I worked at a spoke

45
00:01:47,729 --> 00:01:49,500
shop in Vancouver where I did mobile

46
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,090
applications for the web and also for

47
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:52,770
native and then when I originally joined

48
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:54,960
Mozilla I was working on Firefox OS and

49
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,490
so I actually helped developers one on

50
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:59,280
one take their their applications which

51
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,509
were a largely responsive web

52
00:02:00,509 --> 00:02:02,549
applications and then make them work on

53
00:02:02,549 --> 00:02:04,619
these really low powered low memory

54
00:02:04,619 --> 00:02:06,600
devices which are being shipped across

55
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,200
the world

56
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,019
to other nations to ideally give people

57
00:02:10,019 --> 00:02:12,150
a smartphone experience you know where

58
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:13,349
they would have otherwise purchased a

59
00:02:13,349 --> 00:02:14,190
feature phone for

60
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:15,690
kind of about the same price point and

61
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:17,730
so this talk is sort of a collection of

62
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:20,400
my tips and tools that along the way I

63
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,080
learn from other people and other

64
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,550
companies that do a lot of mobile

65
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:25,320
application development things that I've

66
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,880
had to like bash my head against the

67
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,410
wall at 2:00 in the morning trying to

68
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:29,580
figure out because I really wanted to

69
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:31,410
help someone or ship my own thing and

70
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:33,930
I'm hoping that this talk gives people

71
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:36,540
who are less familiar with mobile

72
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:38,580
websites you know kind of a quick place

73
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:40,350
to go for some easy tips and for those

74
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:41,130
of you who are a little bit more

75
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:42,540
seasoned with mobile development I hope

76
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:44,340
you learn about some cool tools as well

77
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:47,130
so for a manageable workflow I think the

78
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:48,930
really key thing is to get your layout

79
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:52,200
right early and in order to do that you

80
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,400
need to first think about who your

81
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,320
target demographic is now of course

82
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:57,210
we're at this lovely place called

83
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:58,530
Florida which is the United States of

84
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:00,390
America and I'm from Vancouver Canada

85
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:02,670
and so a lot of us here are probably

86
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:04,410
from North America and so we probably

87
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:06,420
have a very North American North

88
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:08,130
American centric view of things

89
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:09,840
of course North America is not the

90
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,820
entire world if you're in South Africa

91
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:13,440
it's likely that you could be using a

92
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,110
blackberry Symbian or a Nokia device or

93
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:18,900
and probably under it as well and you're

94
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:20,580
actually most likely to be using Opera

95
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:23,459
Mini as a browser or maybe Mobile Safari

96
00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:25,140
if you're here in North America you're

97
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:28,260
probably most likely to be using you

98
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:31,170
know mobile safari stock Android 2.3

99
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:31,709
Browser

100
00:03:31,709 --> 00:03:33,870
yes 2.3 we'll get to that in a moment um

101
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:36,630
and of course Chrome for Android Firefox

102
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:38,820
for Android if you're in China you might

103
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:41,160
be using blackberry Symbian Android

104
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:43,739
Nokia series 40 or you might be using

105
00:03:43,739 --> 00:03:46,170
the official Chinese government

106
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:48,390
operating system yes that's right they

107
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:49,680
designed their own operating system

108
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,930
spork Mandarin have not previewed it

109
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:54,450
myself this was this was news to me if

110
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:55,590
you're in Venezuela you're probably

111
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:57,930
running Android or Firefox OS and it's

112
00:03:57,930 --> 00:03:59,820
likely that you could be using the stock

113
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:04,410
Android 2.3 browser as well and so this

114
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:06,600
really just goes to show that you're

115
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:10,170
probably you know how to put it you

116
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:12,900
can't always predict who your market is

117
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,670
going to be it's really nice to think

118
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:16,410
that I am making a page for people that

119
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:18,419
are like me in North America and that's

120
00:04:18,419 --> 00:04:19,769
probably true and maybe that's where you

121
00:04:19,769 --> 00:04:21,930
get most of your traffic but why would

122
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:24,419
you necessarily exclude customers from

123
00:04:24,419 --> 00:04:27,780
other regions by just not catering to

124
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:29,520
the devices that they use or the

125
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,380
browsers that they use for example I

126
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:33,390
mean as far as products go the social

127
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:36,390
network Orkut was a bomb in North

128
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:39,360
America Brazil totally loved it

129
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,970
my friend Jenn Fong did a website called

130
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:43,530
neat spaces where it takes like a little

131
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:45,270
clip of you as an animated gif and like

132
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:47,940
puts it it's like IRC meets snapchat

133
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:50,730
basically and one day suddenly a whole

134
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:52,890
bunch of press French 20-somethings

135
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:54,930
loved it and the thing is like people

136
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:56,250
didn't necessarily think that that was

137
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:57,600
going to be their target market but if

138
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,830
you're especially if you're selling

139
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:00,930
something why would you turn down any

140
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:03,600
market whatsoever so I encourage you

141
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,040
that when you're considering your target

142
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,600
demographic to not totally be North

143
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,670
American centric that being said I know

144
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:10,830
the people there will probably care the

145
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:13,380
most about iOS and Android and so those

146
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:14,580
are largely what we're going to talk

147
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:17,010
about today but please consider going to

148
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:20,430
other markets and other browsers so the

149
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:21,990
first thing of course was you know try

150
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:22,890
to figure out your target demographic

151
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:24,900
because that will help you decide what

152
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,640
your target devices and browsers are

153
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:28,950
maybe you know you're targeting iOS 6 up

154
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:31,650
and particular subset of iOS devices

155
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:33,090
maybe you're targeting a particular

156
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:35,100
subset of Android devices maybe you have

157
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:36,600
a lot of enterprise clients that happen

158
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,040
to be using blackberry and you need to

159
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:41,130
use blackberry hopefully not using web

160
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:43,729
fonts which we learned in the last talk

161
00:05:43,729 --> 00:05:45,810
so that's a very important consideration

162
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:48,120
and deciding the target devices and

163
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,830
browsers are really important because

164
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:52,020
they will frame how your website is

165
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:53,550
created based on the constraints that

166
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:55,770
they have so the next thing and people

167
00:05:55,770 --> 00:05:57,870
are usually into like their intuition is

168
00:05:57,870 --> 00:05:59,370
that I want to start designing stuff

169
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:01,169
right okay so I know who I'm designing

170
00:06:01,169 --> 00:06:03,720
for I know what viewports I'm designing

171
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:06,000
for I'm gonna hop right into Photoshop

172
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,070
perhaps and I'm gonna make some assets

173
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:11,010
no bad don't do it I really recommend

174
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:13,200
prototyping in your browser use a little

175
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,940
bit of structural HTML and some minimal

176
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:17,490
CSS to kind of get the layout right and

177
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:20,910
actually don't open Photoshop yet try

178
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:22,620
and avoid using Photoshop until you

179
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:24,660
really are at the last stages of needing

180
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:26,820
that visual look and feel you can put in

181
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:28,710
place holder content using a lorem ipsum

182
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:30,570
generator and of course using some dummy

183
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:32,640
cat images which I insist are the best

184
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,890
content placeholders for images but

185
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:36,539
don't worry about all the visual look

186
00:06:36,539 --> 00:06:38,160
and feel because what I've noticed that

187
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,889
vellum developers will do when they're

188
00:06:39,889 --> 00:06:41,180
finding stuff is they'll get really hung

189
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:42,830
up on making like the rounded edges and

190
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:44,449
drop shadows look really good but

191
00:06:44,449 --> 00:06:46,099
they'll ignore till the last possible

192
00:06:46,099 --> 00:06:47,810
minute layout issues which would have

193
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:49,370
been a lot easier to debug if they had a

194
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:51,529
lot less CSS to deal with so actually I

195
00:06:51,529 --> 00:06:53,870
recommend prototyping in your browser

196
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:55,639
don't open Photoshop yet back in come

197
00:06:55,639 --> 00:06:57,710
later and you want to be designing

198
00:06:57,710 --> 00:07:00,800
inside the browser with these contextual

199
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,509
constraints of the devices and the

200
00:07:02,509 --> 00:07:04,819
viewports that you're interested in kind

201
00:07:04,819 --> 00:07:06,830
of like when an artist picks a canvas

202
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:08,419
right and artist picks a canvas and

203
00:07:08,419 --> 00:07:09,979
everything they put on the composition

204
00:07:09,979 --> 00:07:11,870
of that canvas that format is

205
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:14,330
constrained by the canvas and the same

206
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:16,969
is true for any kind of development or

207
00:07:16,969 --> 00:07:18,349
composition that we're creating on the

208
00:07:18,349 --> 00:07:20,779
web for people to look at similarly when

209
00:07:20,779 --> 00:07:23,360
you're selecting things to use as

210
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,520
placeholder content make sure that they

211
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,990
are proportional to what you would

212
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:29,900
expect in the final product what I mean

213
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:31,699
by this is if you're doing something

214
00:07:31,699 --> 00:07:33,770
that's a blog and you expect the content

215
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:35,750
to vary a lot make sure that your

216
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:37,279
placeholder content as you develop your

217
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:39,650
layout varies a lot if you're doing a

218
00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:42,349
really targeted product placement on a

219
00:07:42,349 --> 00:07:44,150
landing page and the measurement seemed

220
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:45,800
to be just right to get like you know

221
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,419
it's like a spotlight coming in on your

222
00:07:47,419 --> 00:07:48,979
fancy product and there's like a drop

223
00:07:48,979 --> 00:07:50,569
shadow behind it pick something that

224
00:07:50,569 --> 00:07:52,400
roughly reflects that as well now this

225
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,599
may seem really odd aren't really

226
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:54,919
obvious to some people in the audience

227
00:07:54,919 --> 00:07:56,750
but I can't tell you the number of

228
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:58,520
people who have come to me trying to

229
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,770
debug a layout issue only to drastically

230
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:02,539
change the layout before production and

231
00:08:02,539 --> 00:08:07,129
reintroduce new layout issues so content

232
00:08:07,129 --> 00:08:10,520
shapes design so the thing that I like

233
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:13,399
to use when I'm working on stuff first

234
00:08:13,399 --> 00:08:15,439
actually is the responsive design view

235
00:08:15,439 --> 00:08:18,500
in Firefox and that's actually not just

236
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:21,500
because almost like here it's actually

237
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,060
not just because I work for Mozilla I'll

238
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:24,770
explain why in a sec because in chrome

239
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:27,740
there's actually a device emulator as

240
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:29,509
well I think for the early stages of

241
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:31,370
design that the Firefox responsive

242
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:33,289
design view is an excellent tool and

243
00:08:33,289 --> 00:08:34,849
what you should be using when you start

244
00:08:34,849 --> 00:08:36,169
getting closer to device to device

245
00:08:36,169 --> 00:08:38,089
testing I think that Chrome's device

246
00:08:38,089 --> 00:08:39,829
emulator is what you should be using and

247
00:08:39,829 --> 00:08:41,479
I'll explain that when we get to get a

248
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:43,880
little bit further so if we pop over to

249
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,649
oh gosh this is so tiny on my screen

250
00:08:45,649 --> 00:08:49,100
hold on here oh god no it's good it's

251
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:51,940
beer come back

252
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:56,910
okay hold on a sec here oh no no okay

253
00:08:56,910 --> 00:08:59,080
this is the least fun part of the talk

254
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:02,770
okay let's just come out of full screen

255
00:09:02,770 --> 00:09:08,260
mode for a second here you can laugh

256
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:10,330
it's totally okay all right so we're

257
00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:12,370
looking at the J s comp website I was

258
00:09:12,370 --> 00:09:13,960
originally named as a CSS comp one but

259
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,790
it's a single page and it's actually

260
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:17,950
beautiful and I really couldn't it pick

261
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:19,690
on it but there are some things we can

262
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:22,150
poke around with in the J's comp website

263
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:23,770
which we'll do in a moment here

264
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:25,390
so if you're unfamiliar with responsive

265
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:27,040
design view and the Firefox dev tools in

266
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,600
the lower right corner there's this

267
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,430
little box and it looks kind of like a

268
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:32,260
rectangle in a rectangle that apparently

269
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:34,450
means responsive design view and what

270
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:35,800
happens when you click it is it brings

271
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,510
up a number of buttons and it will

272
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:40,180
resize your viewport to be to represent

273
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:42,160
the kind of device that you're looking

274
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,570
for and from the drop-down here we have

275
00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:45,550
a number of different sizes but what I

276
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:48,190
like about this when comparing it to say

277
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:50,380
the Chrome emulator is I actually like

278
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:52,810
that there's these little sliders on the

279
00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:55,470
size because when you're designing for

280
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:59,440
mobile viewports you kind of don't want

281
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,510
to design with absolute dimensions in

282
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:03,640
mind there's a lot of variation in how

283
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:06,600
different devices and browsers actually

284
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:09,040
you know deal with viewport dimensions

285
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,410
and it can be a really big headache so

286
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:13,750
you might have some variation between

287
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:16,660
all these devices and I sort of look at

288
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:17,830
it as like you want it you know I want

289
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:21,130
to target 320 by 480 ish and for those

290
00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:22,900
of you who are you know not native

291
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:24,750
English speakers the suffix ish

292
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:27,490
expresses a degree of insert of a degree

293
00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:30,010
of uncertainty so when I say I want to

294
00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:33,190
be 3 you know 3 3:20 ish I wanted to be

295
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:34,660
about that wide but what I like to do

296
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:35,980
when I'm designing is actually just kind

297
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:37,840
of fiddle around with this side bar and

298
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:41,080
just see how my text reflows so I can

299
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,370
figure out really sensible font

300
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:45,190
breakpoints for my media queries so

301
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:47,890
that's pretty awesome and then this

302
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:49,510
actually just came to me last week

303
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:51,640
because we got this eyedropper tool

304
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:55,480
right who hears use colorzilla yeah and

305
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,800
then there's equivalent plug-ins for

306
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,840
Chrome it's like that so we got this

307
00:10:58,840 --> 00:10:59,290
awesome

308
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:02,200
color picker tool in Firefox which on

309
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,760
its own is really not that interesting

310
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,380
the thing that I found myself using it

311
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:05,680
for

312
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:09,160
more than an actual color picker was

313
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:11,319
using it to inspect layout issues and

314
00:11:11,319 --> 00:11:14,139
being able to inspect JPEG artifacts and

315
00:11:14,139 --> 00:11:15,939
stuff like that so actually this thing

316
00:11:15,939 --> 00:11:17,350
ends up being really really helpful for

317
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:18,670
someone like me who has a terrible

318
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:20,290
terrible eyesight and like we won't see

319
00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:21,550
that stuff and someone else looks that

320
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:22,899
they're like what's wrong with you and

321
00:11:22,899 --> 00:11:24,670
I'm like I'm blind

322
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:27,730
not even a joke and so I actually find

323
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:28,990
that that's actually pretty helpful too

324
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:32,499
now if we pop over into Chrome I've got

325
00:11:32,499 --> 00:11:33,730
this little panel that when you enter

326
00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:35,949
the dev tools and press escape are right

327
00:11:35,949 --> 00:11:37,119
down here on the left you'll see there's

328
00:11:37,119 --> 00:11:39,879
some tabs for emulation and also for

329
00:11:39,879 --> 00:11:41,110
rendering which we'll talk about in a

330
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:43,329
bit so if I click emulate with this drop

331
00:11:43,329 --> 00:11:45,610
down selected here for Apple iPhone 5 I

332
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:49,360
press that button it resizes the should

333
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,920
resize the viewport let me try

334
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:54,399
refreshing it it's a little bit buggy so

335
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:56,529
I think this is a really awesome tool

336
00:11:56,529 --> 00:11:58,420
and it shows a lot of potential one of

337
00:11:58,420 --> 00:11:59,920
the reasons why I'm using the responsive

338
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,470
design view is because I don't have to

339
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:04,720
refresh the page every time I change the

340
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,399
dimensions whereas I find with this tool

341
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:08,170
I have to although that couldn't go away

342
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:09,490
because I think there's there's you know

343
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:13,749
work that's gonna happen on it and so I

344
00:12:13,749 --> 00:12:14,860
don't yeah I don't like having to do

345
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:16,179
that nobody likes spamming refresh

346
00:12:16,179 --> 00:12:17,589
that's why we have like auto reload for

347
00:12:17,589 --> 00:12:20,290
a region and stuff like that so so this

348
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:21,459
is actually pretty good tool like if you

349
00:12:21,459 --> 00:12:22,990
prefer being in Chrome I think this is

350
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:24,879
also excellent and they give you a lot

351
00:12:24,879 --> 00:12:26,679
of great customization option options so

352
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:28,689
you can select from the the drop-down

353
00:12:28,689 --> 00:12:30,279
one of these presets or you can go into

354
00:12:30,279 --> 00:12:32,949
the screen user agent and all that and

355
00:12:32,949 --> 00:12:34,749
select something that's specific one of

356
00:12:34,749 --> 00:12:35,769
the other things I really like is that

357
00:12:35,769 --> 00:12:38,019
they do like they do let um you late the

358
00:12:38,019 --> 00:12:40,269
device pixel ratio so if you're serving

359
00:12:40,269 --> 00:12:41,499
up a version of your site that has

360
00:12:41,499 --> 00:12:44,379
higher resolution assets for high pixel

361
00:12:44,379 --> 00:12:45,999
ratio and devices like the iPhone 5 and

362
00:12:45,999 --> 00:12:48,009
such you can actually spoof that here

363
00:12:48,009 --> 00:12:55,009
which i think is pretty great alright so

364
00:12:55,019 --> 00:12:58,059
so right after you start to bugging your

365
00:12:58,059 --> 00:12:59,410
layout stuff whether it's with the

366
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:01,809
responsive design view or using Chrome's

367
00:13:01,809 --> 00:13:04,449
device emulator I actually encourage you

368
00:13:04,449 --> 00:13:06,730
at that point still before you get any

369
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:09,610
of your assets into your document to

370
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:11,769
start testing on devices debug that

371
00:13:11,769 --> 00:13:14,769
layout stuff early really really trust

372
00:13:14,769 --> 00:13:16,389
me on this because later on once you've

373
00:13:16,389 --> 00:13:17,829
added all your assets and you're trying

374
00:13:17,829 --> 00:13:18,590
to figure out

375
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:19,850
something doesn't look right you're

376
00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:21,170
gonna have to go through all that CSS

377
00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:23,540
that you've written since this point

378
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:25,340
which I'm warning you about and and deal

379
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:26,990
with that and we're going to talk about

380
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:29,000
remote debugging and on devices a little

381
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,620
bit towards the end in the meantime

382
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:33,380
we're actually going to talk about we're

383
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:35,060
going to talk about some cross browser

384
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:36,680
issues and the major ones that I've run

385
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:38,390
into so again start testing on devices

386
00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:40,460
you know do not pass go do not collect

387
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:42,980
$200 do not do do not do anything else

388
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:44,750
don't be tempted and lured in by the

389
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:46,610
seductiveness of working in Photoshop so

390
00:13:46,610 --> 00:13:48,310
it's really really fun I like it too

391
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:50,480
because it will get frustrating from

392
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,690
here there will be lots of surprises and

393
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:54,500
usually they have to do with

394
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,870
cross-browser and cross-device issues it

395
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:57,980
was really funny when I was making this

396
00:13:57,980 --> 00:13:59,150
talk I wasn't sure how much time I

397
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:01,250
wanted to spend on this until I found

398
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:02,660
myself spending a lot of time on this

399
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:04,339
which i think is really how you describe

400
00:14:04,339 --> 00:14:06,440
any sort of cross browser cross device

401
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:08,510
issues this is the least fun part of

402
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:10,310
making stuff on the web although for a

403
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:12,230
few people out there who I don't know I

404
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:14,540
consider the masochist they seem to get

405
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:17,260
a great deal of pleasure out of it so

406
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:19,790
you know a long time ago actually not

407
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:21,920
long ago enough we had this browser that

408
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,630
everybody disliked called Internet

409
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:25,940
Explorer 6 now to Internet Explorer is

410
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:27,710
credit newer versions of Internet

411
00:14:27,710 --> 00:14:29,690
Explorer actually really awesome the

412
00:14:29,690 --> 00:14:31,450
latest versions have some really awesome

413
00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:34,900
performance profiling tools in them and

414
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:37,100
I'm not going to be the first or last

415
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:39,500
person to say this but Android 2.3 is

416
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:42,170
the new ie6 and I've got to check the

417
00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:43,640
sphere of some common pitfalls because I

418
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:45,230
found that when people were coming to me

419
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:48,020
with applications and web pages that I

420
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:49,910
actually didn't have a lot of problems

421
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:51,530
with most other browsers it's just that

422
00:14:51,530 --> 00:14:53,420
this one I had a huge headache with and

423
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:56,390
it's a pain in the butt it's a bug for a

424
00:14:56,390 --> 00:14:59,660
lot of different reasons the thing is I

425
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:01,970
mean we're Android 4.1 now at four point

426
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:05,570
four four point and audience

427
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:08,330
so Android four points on thing and we

428
00:15:08,330 --> 00:15:09,709
still need to support two point three

429
00:15:09,709 --> 00:15:11,900
from browsing around the web and doing

430
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:13,280
their research on this talk and also

431
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:15,470
speaking to some mobile application

432
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:17,720
companies in Vancouver who have much

433
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:19,790
more experience than I do on this it's

434
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:21,350
really unclear to me at how many people

435
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:23,180
are actually still using Android 2.3

436
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:26,300
some numbers put it at 25% some numbers

437
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,400
put it at 15% it's still a significant

438
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,480
portion of the market that you might

439
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:30,740
care about and so you should probably

440
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:31,810
support Android too

441
00:15:31,810 --> 00:15:35,050
three however it is definitely a pain so

442
00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:36,070
for example the first one is that

443
00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:37,990
position fix basically just doesn't work

444
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:41,710
well at all on Android 2.3 and actually

445
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:43,210
it turns out that position fixed it

446
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:45,220
doesn't really work that great on iOS in

447
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:47,560
general too so stay away from a fixed

448
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:49,270
position if you can in your layout and

449
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:51,010
you will save yourself a whole lot of

450
00:15:51,010 --> 00:15:52,600
headaches now the interesting thing

451
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:53,980
about position fixed is that people

452
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:55,770
figured out this little interesting hack

453
00:15:55,770 --> 00:15:59,370
called back face visibility:hidden and

454
00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:01,450
there are different variations of it

455
00:16:01,450 --> 00:16:03,550
people will apply this to various divs

456
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:05,650
and elements that they want fix

457
00:16:05,650 --> 00:16:07,450
positioning on they'll apply it to

458
00:16:07,450 --> 00:16:09,130
elements that apparently they want

459
00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:10,750
better scroll performance on and I know

460
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:12,220
that Paul Irish is here he'll be talking

461
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:13,510
more about scroll performance later

462
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:14,589
today so I don't want to talk about that

463
00:16:14,589 --> 00:16:14,920
too much

464
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:17,320
and you'll also see that sometimes the

465
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:19,240
add perspective and sometimes they add

466
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:21,730
like transforms to it and the premise

467
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:24,339
behind this is that for these screens

468
00:16:24,339 --> 00:16:26,380
like WebKit and blink and particularly

469
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:27,790
can promote elements that have these

470
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:31,210
qualifying properties to their own layer

471
00:16:31,210 --> 00:16:33,310
so you can get improved performance of

472
00:16:33,310 --> 00:16:34,930
these elements on older Android devices

473
00:16:34,930 --> 00:16:36,370
now it can end up being a problem though

474
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:38,620
sometime if you overuse this and it's

475
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:40,030
not a blanket solution if you don't have

476
00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:42,010
enough virtual RAM you can end up with

477
00:16:42,010 --> 00:16:43,570
worse performance and the transfer of

478
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:45,430
the work from the CPU to GPU can

479
00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:47,200
actually take a performance hit as well

480
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,960
and so actually the jury is out on this

481
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,700
one for me I would love to actually talk

482
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:53,770
to more people because I've done that

483
00:16:53,770 --> 00:16:55,570
and we still kind of didn't agree like

484
00:16:55,570 --> 00:16:58,150
for example I went and talked to a bunch

485
00:16:58,150 --> 00:17:00,670
of people at MOBA Phi lo-fi as a company

486
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:02,500
in Vancouver I pop in there now and then

487
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:03,820
and talk to them about mobile stuff

488
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:04,870
because that's what they do all day

489
00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:06,850
every day and they were like Angelina

490
00:17:06,850 --> 00:17:09,579
back face visibility no huge performance

491
00:17:09,579 --> 00:17:12,069
problems it's not worth it we would deal

492
00:17:12,069 --> 00:17:13,300
with websites where people use it all

493
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:14,860
over the place and apparently using it

494
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:16,030
multiple times can cause huge

495
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:17,949
performance problems but if you search

496
00:17:17,949 --> 00:17:19,420
for problem or even if you search for

497
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:21,790
solutions to the problems of position

498
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:23,829
fixed on Android and respectively iOS

499
00:17:23,829 --> 00:17:26,740
you will find this as the recommended

500
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:28,630
solution in different variations of this

501
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:30,370
sort and also sometimes in relation to

502
00:17:30,370 --> 00:17:32,410
scrolling performance because you know

503
00:17:32,410 --> 00:17:34,170
pushing on to the GPU can theoretically

504
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:37,450
make it more responsive so your mileage

505
00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:39,190
may vary on this one I don't want to

506
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:41,050
like hands-down recommend this I want

507
00:17:41,050 --> 00:17:42,790
you to use this judiciously and make up

508
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:45,120
your own mind

509
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,640
so yes it can cause more performance

510
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:50,250
issues and then it solves so if you're

511
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:52,230
an Android 2.3 using min height max

512
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:54,539
height min with max width they behave

513
00:17:54,539 --> 00:17:56,820
inconsistently I've noticed that min

514
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:59,010
width and Max width will behave pretty

515
00:17:59,010 --> 00:18:00,900
good but min high to max I like don't

516
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:01,320
even bother

517
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:02,610
they just won't stretch the way that you

518
00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:03,960
think they will and it's really annoying

519
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:06,440
so just avoid those if possible

520
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:09,419
overflow:auto nope just don't use it

521
00:18:09,419 --> 00:18:11,730
sometimes it kind of works and then you

522
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:13,320
actually the time is that it kind of

523
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:14,610
works you'll have a container and the

524
00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:16,919
text will overflow but then kind of be

525
00:18:16,919 --> 00:18:18,539
cut off in a weird way and then nobody

526
00:18:18,539 --> 00:18:19,950
can read it so just just don't just stay

527
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:23,309
with overflow:auto so yeah just don't

528
00:18:23,309 --> 00:18:26,130
use it and the z-index now z-index is

529
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:28,049
another one that comes up a lot it has a

530
00:18:28,049 --> 00:18:29,460
lack of respect for absolutely

531
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:30,870
positioned elements which is really

532
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:32,220
annoying because often with mobile

533
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:34,049
designs you want to have a sticky header

534
00:18:34,049 --> 00:18:35,070
at the top that you'll absolutely

535
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:36,840
position sometimes and I don't really

536
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,010
like this one websites will have little

537
00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:39,390
tabs on the side that you can click on

538
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:41,520
that are social or contact things and so

539
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,529
I think the absolute positioning is

540
00:18:43,529 --> 00:18:45,210
actually a pretty important thing for

541
00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:46,529
mobile in this respect considering how

542
00:18:46,529 --> 00:18:49,110
people use it however it turns out this

543
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:50,970
is actually very easy to easy to set

544
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:53,490
just make sure that you add a z-index on

545
00:18:53,490 --> 00:18:55,110
the body tag and make sure that that is

546
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:57,059
set well to zero and then all the other

547
00:18:57,059 --> 00:18:59,909
index elements will stack on top of it a

548
00:18:59,909 --> 00:19:01,559
lot of the time people will just give

549
00:19:01,559 --> 00:19:03,390
something as the index but not you know

550
00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:05,190
think that they want to have a z-index

551
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:07,590
beneath that element it's something that

552
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:08,940
just kind of works out of the box and

553
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:10,440
other browsers but here this is the easy

554
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,630
fix for it so if your rosy index

555
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:15,270
problems I'm solutioning this isn't the

556
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:20,789
trick for you this one weird trick so

557
00:19:20,789 --> 00:19:23,399
the other caveat is ms are poorly

558
00:19:23,399 --> 00:19:24,720
supported and M's are kind of the

559
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,279
cornerstone they will think they're like

560
00:19:26,279 --> 00:19:28,860
the gold standard unit that people use

561
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:30,179
for a responsive design I guess

562
00:19:30,179 --> 00:19:31,950
percentages and M's that I probably see

563
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:34,320
the most and they're kind of janky you

564
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,580
can still use them but it'll be

565
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:37,980
frustrating for you Remz don't even

566
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:39,659
think about it now interesting thing

567
00:19:39,659 --> 00:19:41,850
though I found out that the X unit is

568
00:19:41,850 --> 00:19:43,590
supported so if you want to start

569
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:45,510
designing in X units then hey your

570
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:47,250
problems are solved so I don't know if

571
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:48,659
that's really gonna you know not really

572
00:19:48,659 --> 00:19:50,070
know this information is gonna spur an

573
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:52,679
entire design paradigm shift but if you

574
00:19:52,679 --> 00:19:54,419
are targeting Android 2.3 maybe you

575
00:19:54,419 --> 00:19:56,399
consider using a slightly different unit

576
00:19:56,399 --> 00:19:58,950
of measurement

577
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,960
gradience nope nope not on Android 2.3

578
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,100
don't even try it

579
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:05,350
they're not there which is you know

580
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:06,750
there's not really the best-performing

581
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:08,740
property anyway which we'll get to in a

582
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:14,160
little bit so when we go to iOS however

583
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:16,300
the interesting thing about the iOS

584
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:17,980
market share for browsers is that about

585
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:21,370
right now but 80 to 90 percent of people

586
00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:23,800
are on iOS 7 and it wasn't released that

587
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:26,140
long ago I mean Apple they pester people

588
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:27,430
like I just plugged it I've got an

589
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:30,120
iPhone amongst other devices and I

590
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:32,920
plugged that thing in and every time I

591
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,360
swear like every couple days that wants

592
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:36,820
me to upgrade to a new version and so I

593
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:38,350
do because I don't wanna be pestered

594
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:40,120
anymore and this actually really works

595
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:41,650
because there's only about ten or ten

596
00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:43,450
maybe fifteen twenty percent if we fudge

597
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:47,050
those numbers left of s6 users which is

598
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:48,370
really great because it means that we've

599
00:20:48,370 --> 00:20:50,920
got this this really forward-thinking

600
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,630
set of people that are using newer

601
00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:55,300
features that we want to sign with note

602
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:57,490
that at media queries and give portrait

603
00:20:57,490 --> 00:20:59,020
dimensions even after rotating to

604
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:00,460
landscape which is a complete pain in

605
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:03,850
the butt position fixed also buggy even

606
00:21:03,850 --> 00:21:05,890
on iOS 7 also very annoying

607
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:08,410
now flexbox is something that too I

608
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:10,240
think most developers is kind of a bit

609
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,890
of a godsend right I mean like it just

610
00:21:11,890 --> 00:21:12,850
seemed really great to be able to

611
00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:14,590
express things and proportions and have

612
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:17,020
the browser figure out the rest however

613
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:19,980
it's been through several iterations of

614
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:23,650
declaration I suppose and several

615
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:26,200
several iterations and the spec and so

616
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,190
there are a number of different

617
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:30,370
declarations Chris coil of CSS tricks

618
00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:33,610
recommends that you use this declaration

619
00:21:33,610 --> 00:21:35,620
and the order matters because the

620
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:38,440
display property is not prefixed here so

621
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:40,720
if you're ever using flexbox this is the

622
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,340
magic incantation that should work on

623
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:45,940
any CRO any firefox opera 12 plus I

624
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:50,380
think ie 10 plus C ie just does not have

625
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:51,850
really great flex box support but we're

626
00:21:51,850 --> 00:21:53,890
talking about mobile so who cares and

627
00:21:53,890 --> 00:21:55,630
Android should work on should work on

628
00:21:55,630 --> 00:21:58,000
those two i'm firefox and chrome on

629
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,650
Android which are browsers that are not

630
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:02,800
as popular as mobile safari and 2.3 and

631
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,570
actually 2.3 and then chrome on Android

632
00:22:04,570 --> 00:22:07,300
since you know Google introduced that is

633
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:09,430
in kind of gaining and two point three

634
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:11,320
is slowly waning both Firefox and Chrome

635
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:11,860
own and err

636
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:14,380
are pretty close to their counterparts

637
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:16,240
or identical to their counterparts on

638
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,010
desktop when it comes to the rendering

639
00:22:18,010 --> 00:22:19,510
engines inside so you shouldn't have a

640
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:20,830
whole lot of problems with those I

641
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:22,720
certainly don't which is great because

642
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,580
by that point I'm really really tired

643
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:27,070
and I just kind of want to move on so

644
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:29,020
everyone else has educators to like if

645
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:30,670
you do have to ship on blackberry if you

646
00:22:30,670 --> 00:22:32,340
do have to ship on opera Opera Mini

647
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:35,049
there are lots of those these two your

648
00:22:35,049 --> 00:22:37,030
resources corks mode or which has been

649
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:38,740
around for a long time and I'm sure many

650
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:40,240
of you're familiar with is great but

651
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:43,169
this particular github repo from scott

652
00:22:43,169 --> 00:22:47,200
jill has a tracker of basically people

653
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,390
filing device specific issues and

654
00:22:49,390 --> 00:22:51,250
inconsistencies and that is also a

655
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:53,950
really excellent resource so if your

656
00:22:53,950 --> 00:22:55,690
layout is decent by this point then I

657
00:22:55,690 --> 00:22:56,830
think that it's time to consider

658
00:22:56,830 --> 00:22:58,540
performance and you want to use this

659
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:00,250
point when your layout is mostly decent

660
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:01,330
between browsers and sort of your

661
00:23:01,330 --> 00:23:02,919
baseline because as soon as you start

662
00:23:02,919 --> 00:23:04,390
adding really really nice stuff like

663
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:06,490
graphics and web fonts you're adding

664
00:23:06,490 --> 00:23:08,770
HTTP requests overhead and such so I

665
00:23:08,770 --> 00:23:10,419
would use this as your baseline for

666
00:23:10,419 --> 00:23:12,340
performance and as you add various

667
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:14,110
things to your page to enhance your

668
00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:16,360
content you want to be comparing

669
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:17,860
constantly to make sure that you're not

670
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:19,870
doing something that gives you like a 15

671
00:23:19,870 --> 00:23:20,890
Meg

672
00:23:20,890 --> 00:23:22,720
I'm super into Sailor Moon by the way

673
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:25,179
like you really need to know that and if

674
00:23:25,179 --> 00:23:26,380
you go to the Sailor Moon official

675
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:27,640
website because they're releasing a new

676
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:30,700
a new series soon I was like wanting to

677
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:31,780
inspect it because I felt like some

678
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:34,030
stars and full mystical and stuff I was

679
00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:36,400
like oh this is really really cool but

680
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,020
it was the only page I've ever been to

681
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:40,120
in years where every page had a loading

682
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,380
spinner and the page weight was

683
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:43,299
something like 15 Meg's and even on

684
00:23:43,299 --> 00:23:44,799
mobile it was like it was really heavy

685
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:46,750
so I was like man I love Sailor Moon but

686
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:49,510
not that much so a crash verse and a few

687
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:53,070
performance problems for for mobile

688
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:55,690
selector and property performance now

689
00:23:55,690 --> 00:23:57,220
browsers are fast so I don't want you to

690
00:23:57,220 --> 00:23:59,260
like labor over your selectors and your

691
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:01,030
properties like tryin to hyper optimize

692
00:24:01,030 --> 00:24:02,530
them the browser will say take care of

693
00:24:02,530 --> 00:24:04,650
stuff for you so browsers are fast

694
00:24:04,650 --> 00:24:06,580
except for when they're not and

695
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:09,250
generally the rules of thumb that I've

696
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:11,080
found are stay away from the star

697
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:13,840
selector just avoid it if you can stay

698
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:15,370
away from really really long class names

699
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:16,660
because you're gonna have to let go

700
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:17,919
through lots of trees to find what

701
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:19,059
you're looking for

702
00:24:19,059 --> 00:24:21,660
border-radius big performance culprit

703
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:22,780
box-shadow

704
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:24,550
also a performance culprit although

705
00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:25,539
border-radius seems

706
00:24:25,539 --> 00:24:28,059
to actually do worse transform

707
00:24:28,059 --> 00:24:30,309
specifically rotations will kind of give

708
00:24:30,309 --> 00:24:32,200
you some genki genki performance as well

709
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:34,690
and also check your preprocessor output

710
00:24:34,690 --> 00:24:36,399
if you take a look at this top example

711
00:24:36,399 --> 00:24:37,809
and you take a look at the bottom

712
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:39,279
example can anybody in the audience tell

713
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:40,869
me what the problem is with what's

714
00:24:40,869 --> 00:24:47,139
generated in the bottom example what's

715
00:24:47,139 --> 00:24:52,179
that someone said something about i7 ok

716
00:24:52,179 --> 00:24:54,220
so yeah so the issue with what's

717
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:56,470
generated on the bottom is that it's

718
00:24:56,470 --> 00:24:57,759
created this class where it's actually

719
00:24:57,759 --> 00:24:59,679
going to go through all of the all of

720
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:01,960
the tree 4 steps in order to find out if

721
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,789
anything applies to or is going to apply

722
00:25:03,789 --> 00:25:05,229
to it is 7 so we'll go through all of

723
00:25:05,229 --> 00:25:07,809
this tree and the thing is the ia7 rule

724
00:25:07,809 --> 00:25:09,249
might not apply to any of those things

725
00:25:09,249 --> 00:25:10,869
in the page so we don't actually need

726
00:25:10,869 --> 00:25:14,080
that now CSS coverage analysis is pretty

727
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,639
important because the fastest rule is

728
00:25:15,639 --> 00:25:21,159
one that doesn't exist so if you go into

729
00:25:21,159 --> 00:25:24,519
chrome and we're looking at the and

730
00:25:24,519 --> 00:25:27,970
we're looking at the word we hear audits

731
00:25:27,970 --> 00:25:30,129
page and we run this happy little tool

732
00:25:30,129 --> 00:25:31,899
that's scared of that and we look at

733
00:25:31,899 --> 00:25:33,340
webpage performance it will actually

734
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:36,340
tell us hey remove these unused CSS

735
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:38,080
selectors and that's really helpful but

736
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,269
this has only run on one page so if we

737
00:25:40,269 --> 00:25:43,960
pop over to Firefox and hop into here we

738
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:46,690
actually have this new tool that just

739
00:25:46,690 --> 00:25:49,599
landed in nightly and if I go to see

740
00:25:49,599 --> 00:25:51,340
here let's turn off the responsive

741
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:53,739
design view there's actually a developer

742
00:25:53,739 --> 00:25:55,029
toolbar at the bottom where there should

743
00:25:55,029 --> 00:26:02,049
be where are you oh no it's down there I

744
00:26:02,049 --> 00:26:09,729
just can't see it all right okay oh and

745
00:26:09,729 --> 00:26:10,749
it's super tiny for me

746
00:26:10,749 --> 00:26:13,479
CSS coverage starts so we start the CSS

747
00:26:13,479 --> 00:26:14,979
coverage tool little bar tells us that

748
00:26:14,979 --> 00:26:16,359
it's running and we navigate to

749
00:26:16,359 --> 00:26:17,979
different pages and what the CSS

750
00:26:17,979 --> 00:26:19,479
coverage tool does is it aggregates all

751
00:26:19,479 --> 00:26:22,179
of those pages and then when we hit the

752
00:26:22,179 --> 00:26:24,729
X here it will actually go and we go

753
00:26:24,729 --> 00:26:27,519
into gasps coughs CSS you'll actually

754
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:29,259
see some rules it's very hard to see but

755
00:26:29,259 --> 00:26:31,269
they have a strike through them and this

756
00:26:31,269 --> 00:26:32,379
is a little bit different to what you

757
00:26:32,379 --> 00:26:33,879
would normally see the inspector and

758
00:26:33,879 --> 00:26:36,070
then it's actually showing us rules that

759
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:38,200
tool has a reason to believe are not

760
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:41,110
used at all and could be removed safely

761
00:26:41,110 --> 00:26:42,520
on the pages that we've just browse

762
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:44,020
however that may not be true because

763
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:45,430
some of these Styles might be applied

764
00:26:45,430 --> 00:26:47,200
with JavaScript at some later point and

765
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,210
so we didn't go through every page so

766
00:26:49,210 --> 00:26:50,920
for example the one that says curator I

767
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:52,630
know for a fact that one exists on the

768
00:26:52,630 --> 00:26:54,460
about page so that's applied there and

769
00:26:54,460 --> 00:27:00,730
then if we type a CSS coverage this nice

770
00:27:00,730 --> 00:27:02,350
little pie chart which will tell you

771
00:27:02,350 --> 00:27:04,300
these styles that are relevant before

772
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:05,920
the load event is fired and which aren't

773
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,750
and this means you can actually optimize

774
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:09,550
your pages a little bit about what I'm

775
00:27:09,550 --> 00:27:10,840
going about to tell you is a little bit

776
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:12,850
counterintuitive if there are styles

777
00:27:12,850 --> 00:27:15,340
that you absolutely need put them in a

778
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:17,320
style tag in your head and if their

779
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:20,080
styles that you don't need and their

780
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,550
Styles that you don't need take the link

781
00:27:21,550 --> 00:27:22,840
tag and actually put it with your

782
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:24,580
JavaScript that you defer as well at the

783
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:26,350
bottom of your page now I know you want

784
00:27:26,350 --> 00:27:28,150
to separate your structural stuff from

785
00:27:28,150 --> 00:27:30,190
your presentation and so at some point

786
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:31,780
that sort of does break down but if you

787
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:33,040
can get away with it do it and do it

788
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:33,970
because you can actually get some

789
00:27:33,970 --> 00:27:36,760
performance gains that way okay I'm

790
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:38,260
Brassica Lee running out of time so

791
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:41,320
let's blow through this right so the

792
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:43,030
fastest rules one that isn't there when

793
00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:44,530
you get to the very last stages of

794
00:27:44,530 --> 00:27:46,060
production go through and try and remove

795
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:48,250
the stuff that is cruft from maybe your

796
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:49,840
CSS framework like styles that are

797
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:52,120
unused and just do a general clean that

798
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:53,470
way one of the things that I like to do

799
00:27:53,470 --> 00:27:55,120
is take all the styles that I apply with

800
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:57,400
JavaScript and put them in a CSS file

801
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:59,140
and then run a grunt task that like goes

802
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:00,430
through all the stuff except for that

803
00:28:00,430 --> 00:28:02,770
CSS file and basically it takes out all

804
00:28:02,770 --> 00:28:05,710
of the cruft for me that is a 1:1 method

805
00:28:05,710 --> 00:28:09,070
that I recommend so we just did that one

806
00:28:09,070 --> 00:28:11,500
awesome Network conditions you are only

807
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:12,970
as good as your worst case and not

808
00:28:12,970 --> 00:28:14,670
everybody has really really fantastic

809
00:28:14,670 --> 00:28:16,720
Network conditions and also if you

810
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:17,500
happen to be driving through the

811
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:19,540
countryside of Montana well hey maybe

812
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:20,770
your coverage isn't that great actually

813
00:28:20,770 --> 00:28:25,300
it's pretty good now but on oh s X using

814
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:26,560
Charles or the network link conditioner

815
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:28,210
will allow you to spoof different

816
00:28:28,210 --> 00:28:29,440
differing network connections

817
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:31,180
this is really great to see exactly how

818
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:33,490
progressively your page loads really

819
00:28:33,490 --> 00:28:36,490
explicitly windows Charles and dummynet

820
00:28:36,490 --> 00:28:38,710
and net limiter and Linux Charles so

821
00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:40,510
basically use Charles it's great it's

822
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:42,070
like it's a couple bucks and I think

823
00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:44,830
it's a really really great tool you can

824
00:28:44,830 --> 00:28:46,930
also measure FPS which is a great way to

825
00:28:46,930 --> 00:28:48,610
look at your performance for different

826
00:28:48,610 --> 00:28:49,700
interaction animations

827
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:51,980
and scrolling chrome if you go back into

828
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:55,610
the tiny menu we were in has where we go

829
00:28:55,610 --> 00:29:00,260
here there we go okay so we actually

830
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:05,539
have rendering we have an FPS meters so

831
00:29:05,539 --> 00:29:07,639
as oh this is the thing so the one

832
00:29:07,639 --> 00:29:09,169
caveat in that I don't like about this

833
00:29:09,169 --> 00:29:11,149
right now is if I get out of Device

834
00:29:11,149 --> 00:29:15,139
emulation I will have the FPS reader or

835
00:29:15,139 --> 00:29:18,679
of FPS widget but if I'm in and the

836
00:29:18,679 --> 00:29:20,240
emulation would I don't have the FPS

837
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,470
widget and I would really really want

838
00:29:21,470 --> 00:29:23,240
that for mobile but there's a really

839
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:25,130
great FPS widget in chrome which is

840
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:27,080
really great for for testing at your

841
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:30,919
performance and in Firefox we have a

842
00:29:30,919 --> 00:29:32,510
little tool that's going to be in the

843
00:29:32,510 --> 00:29:34,549
profiler that will give you your lowest

844
00:29:34,549 --> 00:29:37,070
FPS your highest fps and the average and

845
00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:40,370
actually it's pretty important that your

846
00:29:40,370 --> 00:29:43,970
FPS is stable and above about 30 FPS at

847
00:29:43,970 --> 00:29:46,070
minimum rather than having to jump all

848
00:29:46,070 --> 00:29:47,299
over the place like maybe sometimes at

849
00:29:47,299 --> 00:29:49,190
60 and sometimes it's 20 if you can't

850
00:29:49,190 --> 00:29:50,809
get it to stick at something consistent

851
00:29:50,809 --> 00:29:52,250
it's it's not going to be great for your

852
00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:55,010
end users so testing on devices so we

853
00:29:55,010 --> 00:29:56,600
can wrap this all up right we want to

854
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:58,159
remote debug like pros because when we

855
00:29:58,159 --> 00:29:59,330
get to this point after we've gone

856
00:29:59,330 --> 00:30:01,039
through designing this thing and testing

857
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:03,409
it in the you know maybe in Chrome's

858
00:30:03,409 --> 00:30:06,139
device emulation panel you want to

859
00:30:06,139 --> 00:30:07,669
actually test on devices because that's

860
00:30:07,669 --> 00:30:08,929
what matters one of the things I like to

861
00:30:08,929 --> 00:30:10,970
do is set up a little local server and

862
00:30:10,970 --> 00:30:12,710
then like navigate my device to it but I

863
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:14,389
don't get developer tools with that and

864
00:30:14,389 --> 00:30:16,130
if something goes wrong it's not very

865
00:30:16,130 --> 00:30:17,750
easy I mean if you've got a good eye you

866
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:19,250
can spot some layout bugs and that's

867
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:21,679
pretty fantastic so solution is just to

868
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:24,320
buy all the phones right yeah one

869
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:25,429
argument that I've been giving the

870
00:30:25,429 --> 00:30:27,440
people though is actually to get your

871
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:28,880
hands on a Firefox OS device because

872
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,169
they're cheap and lots of device labs

873
00:30:30,169 --> 00:30:32,510
have have them just because if anything

874
00:30:32,510 --> 00:30:34,669
can run on there it will run everywhere

875
00:30:34,669 --> 00:30:36,679
else they're not high powered devices so

876
00:30:36,679 --> 00:30:38,330
if it runs there it will run everywhere

877
00:30:38,330 --> 00:30:41,269
they're very cheap to buy Android 2.3

878
00:30:41,269 --> 00:30:42,950
browser you're going to be using Winery

879
00:30:42,950 --> 00:30:44,600
which is a script remote debugging tool

880
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:46,549
that injects you know inject some script

881
00:30:46,549 --> 00:30:47,870
into your page and you get kind of like

882
00:30:47,870 --> 00:30:50,330
a janky version of the Safari WebKit

883
00:30:50,330 --> 00:30:52,760
tools but it's not fully functional it's

884
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:54,110
very frustrating so if you're still

885
00:30:54,110 --> 00:30:58,059
trying to remote to bug on 2.3 godspeed

886
00:30:58,059 --> 00:31:00,409
so if you're debugging Firefox or

887
00:31:00,409 --> 00:31:03,590
Firefox for Android use Firefox bugging

888
00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:05,629
Chrome for Android is Chrome yeah I see

889
00:31:05,629 --> 00:31:07,399
a problem here the bugging mobile safari

890
00:31:07,399 --> 00:31:10,159
okay finally as IO 6 we can do that with

891
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:11,749
safaris dev tools and I did learn that

892
00:31:11,749 --> 00:31:12,919
there was actually a chrome bridge

893
00:31:12,919 --> 00:31:15,200
although it was unclear to me exactly

894
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,669
how to do that and it didn't quite work

895
00:31:16,669 --> 00:31:18,590
out of the box that I expected but it's

896
00:31:18,590 --> 00:31:19,669
there so the problem here is that

897
00:31:19,669 --> 00:31:23,149
everybody is in silos personally I think

898
00:31:23,149 --> 00:31:25,220
that our tools should go where the web

899
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:27,860
is and that is everywhere and I don't

900
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:29,419
like the idea that I have to work in

901
00:31:29,419 --> 00:31:31,399
silos to do all of my remote debugging

902
00:31:31,399 --> 00:31:33,769
so I wanted to give you before I go a

903
00:31:33,769 --> 00:31:35,450
little sneak peek into something that's

904
00:31:35,450 --> 00:31:37,519
coming with the Firefox dev tools that I

905
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:39,230
think really will help solve some of

906
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:40,759
this problem for people and it is called

907
00:31:40,759 --> 00:31:42,799
Project fever dream we like to name

908
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:43,879
things a little bit ridiculously

909
00:31:43,879 --> 00:31:45,440
internally so it reminds us to change

910
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:52,669
the name so pop over here so what I'm

911
00:31:52,669 --> 00:31:54,919
going to show you is our dev tools

912
00:31:54,919 --> 00:31:57,200
connecting to Firefox we're just going

913
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,369
to change some text it says shared

914
00:31:58,369 --> 00:32:01,580
knowledge that will change to to move

915
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:03,049
everywhere and then we'll change the

916
00:32:03,049 --> 00:32:04,730
background to a color pink that we call

917
00:32:04,730 --> 00:32:06,350
Paul Rose a pink Paul is a member of the

918
00:32:06,350 --> 00:32:08,240
dev tools and he's well known for making

919
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,889
things stand out with this pink and then

920
00:32:09,889 --> 00:32:11,809
we'll just go through and do a console

921
00:32:11,809 --> 00:32:15,499
console alert so that we can see that

922
00:32:15,499 --> 00:32:16,879
yes we are connected and it will say

923
00:32:16,879 --> 00:32:18,830
hello from Firefox okay well that's

924
00:32:18,830 --> 00:32:20,119
great we knew that Firefox would connect

925
00:32:20,119 --> 00:32:21,710
to the Firefox dev tools and I apologize

926
00:32:21,710 --> 00:32:22,789
for the quality here we just whipped

927
00:32:22,789 --> 00:32:25,340
this up at the last minute we're doing

928
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:26,539
the same thing we're going to change the

929
00:32:26,539 --> 00:32:28,009
text on there we're connected to Chrome

930
00:32:28,009 --> 00:32:29,960
on Android with the Firefox dev tools

931
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:32,240
and we're also going to change the power

932
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:34,759
shape pink and do an alert but of course

933
00:32:34,759 --> 00:32:36,200
what most people care about is the most

934
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:38,350
used market share and they care about

935
00:32:38,350 --> 00:32:41,990
iOS and so right now we've worked hard

936
00:32:41,990 --> 00:32:43,369
on that and made it so that you can

937
00:32:43,369 --> 00:32:44,960
actually connect using the Firefox dev

938
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,399
tools that's hard to see it's an iPad

939
00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:48,259
they're running Safari you can connect

940
00:32:48,259 --> 00:32:50,240
and debug Safari which with much better

941
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:53,179
dev tools now than the Safari ones which

942
00:32:53,179 --> 00:32:54,860
sorry Safari they just really really

943
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:55,279
stink

944
00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:56,269
so we're gonna change the background a

945
00:32:56,269 --> 00:32:58,850
polish a pink and everything works it

946
00:32:58,850 --> 00:33:04,070
should say hello from Safari so this

947
00:33:04,070 --> 00:33:05,330
feature unlike the ones that I showed

948
00:33:05,330 --> 00:33:08,509
you today hasn't totally landed yet so

949
00:33:08,509 --> 00:33:10,009

00:33:10,009 --> 00:33:12,769

00:33:16,510 --> 00:33:19,480
tools on Twitter so that's it

954
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:21,190
Oh oh my god I totally forgot one really

955
00:33:21,190 --> 00:33:22,419
important thing and it's totally amazing

956
00:33:22,419 --> 00:33:23,980
okay so just like this one thing the guy

957
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:24,790
in the front row is giving me the

958
00:33:24,790 --> 00:33:26,260
stink-eye so I know I'm supposed to be

959
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:28,120
done but I promise you that this is

960
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:31,330
helpful one thing that just landed

961
00:33:31,330 --> 00:33:32,950
thanks to Heather Arthur who's here is

962
00:33:32,950 --> 00:33:35,799
if you go into the style editor style

963
00:33:35,799 --> 00:33:36,910
she is unhappy because it couldn't be

964
00:33:36,910 --> 00:33:41,720
loaded that's cool go to a style editor

965
00:33:41,730 --> 00:33:46,419
and we right-click on one of these style

966
00:33:46,419 --> 00:33:48,490
sheets and we actually take a look over

967
00:33:48,490 --> 00:33:50,020
on the right here you'll see that there

968
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:51,429
are actually media queries that are

969
00:33:51,429 --> 00:33:52,360
highlighted if you're using the

970
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:54,250
responsive design view and resizing it

971
00:33:54,250 --> 00:33:56,020
it will actually highlight which media

972
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:57,580
queries apply to your page and if you

973
00:33:57,580 --> 00:33:59,410
click on them it will take you to those

974
00:33:59,410 --> 00:34:01,570
media queries in your code and that is

975
00:34:01,570 --> 00:34:03,540
the last thing I have for you today
