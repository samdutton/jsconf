1
00:00:16,299 --> 00:00:20,570

you

2
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:23,029
hi everyone I'm gonna be talking about

3
00:00:23,029 --> 00:00:25,590
these new library I've been working on

4
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:27,300
these leaves new library framework Oh

5
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:31,800
fringes fringes I still don't know very

6
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,410
well how to define it but uh I'll try by

7
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:35,399
now saying that it's a real-time

8
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:38,250
animations editor for the web and

9
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:40,530
hopefully at some point it's also gonna

10
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:41,970
be by the web like people is gonna be

11
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:43,940
contributing some effects and some

12
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:47,970
filters and stuff like that I always

13
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:49,890
talk about demoscene but I need to talk

14
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:53,100
about it a bit as a background so back

15
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:55,410
in the end I used to be a little bit

16
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:56,760
active in the demoscene like ten years

17
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:58,949
ago or something like that back in the

18
00:00:58,949 --> 00:01:01,350
days the demoscene they would do what

19
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:03,629
they do is bunch of people that they try

20
00:01:03,629 --> 00:01:05,670
to do some real-time animations that

21
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:08,670
they showcase what the computer on the

22
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:10,440
platform can do like in the same way

23
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:12,570
that nowadays we're doing WebGL they

24
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:13,979
must ensuring what what y'all can do

25
00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:15,570
back then they will show you what like a

26
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:17,759
4x6 will do or like I wanna make a condo

27
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:22,580
so this is how I know we can see well

28
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:26,220
this is how a code is should look like

29
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:28,830
on the first ones like as simple as it

30
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:29,130
gets

31
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:31,590
you'll have like a loop that he will be

32
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:33,509
running every frame and they were

33
00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:36,690
checking if the time was less than five

34
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:39,000
seconds and it will you will put all

35
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,640
this chunk of code of what it will take

36
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,890
to render like a title of the demo for

37
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:46,470
instance and then if the time was less

38
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:48,090
than ten like if it was bigger than five

39
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:50,160
unless and ten and you have all this

40
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,690
code for like running like running in

41
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:53,729
this cube and then same thing for the

42
00:01:53,729 --> 00:01:56,610
plasma cube or I said the plasma of

43
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:57,690
course you always have to get like that

44
00:01:57,690 --> 00:01:59,789
girl in which at some point that will go

45
00:01:59,789 --> 00:02:03,270
after this time was twenty seconds

46
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:05,899
this doesn't really sound like a very

47
00:02:05,899 --> 00:02:08,759
scalable setup like if you had to work

48
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:09,989
with other people you have to work with

49
00:02:09,989 --> 00:02:13,050
a like a designer coefficient or

50
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:15,840
something like that like a musician like

51
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,940
for editing it will take like way too

52
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:19,590
much time like a big I will say like

53
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:20,940
what about making these like five

54
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:23,040
seconds short or stuff like that so they

55
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,599
will have to modify the whole code and

56
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:26,410
then compile again

57
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:29,590
I just wouldn't scale out very well so

58
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:32,200
at one point people started to build

59
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:37,150
their own editing tools so this is one

60
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:40,810
that in our team we built well I didn't

61
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:42,700
really do much like I wasn't a developer

62
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:45,250
back then I was using graphics so the

63
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:49,570
guy on my team built this one and it was

64
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:51,280
pretty basic like as you can see you

65
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,550
have like some layers at the bottom and

66
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:56,170
it was this was pretty much determine

67
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:57,910
and every point was kind of to set up

68
00:02:57,910 --> 00:02:59,430
some effects some thoughts into that

69
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:04,930
effect and then we had this was another

70
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:08,400
example of a timeline oh my god narrator

71
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,900
this one has a little bit it was a

72
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:14,770
little bit more advanced like it had is

73
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:19,720
a curve to you so it had the same I also

74
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,130
had like a timeline bill that you had

75
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:22,630
all the blocks like it and usually like

76
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:25,150
in Premiere like after effect you will

77
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:28,780
have this bill but also has this curve

78
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:31,360
panel that you will be able to do some

79
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,340
curves that it will like you have like a

80
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:35,260
fade effect that you have like a like a

81
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:36,550
camera that goes when teased you will be

82
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:38,110
able to modify that apply that curve to

83
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:42,490
any value from that 3d scene and this

84
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:45,940
one was the last one that we used it was

85
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:47,500
everything everyone each one was done

86
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:48,910
with a different guy and somehow I was

87
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:51,640
working with those guys and I - we used

88
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:54,130
those tools the good thing or these this

89
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:55,360
one was also very similar to the

90
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,650
previous one like he also had a team

91
00:03:56,650 --> 00:03:58,510
like timeline I also had all this like

92
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:03,160
this was like the curve Bo Adam what he

93
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,750
was amazing all these is that all those

94
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:06,850
parameters that you will change you will

95
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:09,520
you will see exactly in real time

96
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,470
immediately what it will affect like how

97
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:13,840
we look like suddenly I cannot share the

98
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,030
tools because they were for Windows and

99
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:18,000
an item because that was always anymore

100
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,070
but all these we can see there was a

101
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:22,660
screenshot so it will be nice to be able

102
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:24,520
to do a better than more them but I

103
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:25,720
think you can get a little bit of an

104
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:30,030
idea of it so the output of the

105
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:33,580
animations that we did a demo so the

106
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:36,250
problem the output wasn't really amazing

107
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:39,840
because all these was like Howie

108
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,030
work like no one was paying for this we

109
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:44,510
will compete with each other and

110
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:49,260
basically we we will work in a new

111
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:51,120
animation or any of them or like a two

112
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,460
weeks before the competition so you only

113
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:55,080
had time like like two weeks to build

114
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,870
something the developer do so will like

115
00:04:57,870 --> 00:04:59,310
over the year will be like working on

116
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:00,860
his free time like building these tools

117
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:03,450
but the output it was always you always

118
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:05,730
had to say like but it was done in two

119
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:07,500
weeks you know don't judge it that way

120
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:08,970
like it's not like after effects

121
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:12,660
animation which that's kind of the

122
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:15,240
reasoning of all this stuff like I saw

123
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,310
that it was a lot of potential on this

124
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:19,500
like it was the whole real-time and

125
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:23,520
everything was amazing and I always so I

126
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:26,220
always was very impressed with it means

127
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:27,510
that After Effects didn't have like

128
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:29,510
things like that or like any other like

129
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:32,130
famous editing tool like it was in real

130
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:35,130
time so it's an example show like this

131
00:05:35,130 --> 00:08:43,540
one that we're seeing here I again like

132
00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:45,450
Thanks

133
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:50,910
so so these these demo for this one I

134
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:52,560
was doing all the modeling on 3d studio

135
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:56,790
max we had some exporters also we will

136
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:59,220
build our own exporters so we will

137
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:01,230
export from there to our own format and

138
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:02,610
then it will load in this in this tool

139
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:05,390
and then do all the editing and all the

140
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:07,320
movements I don't know maybe the camera

141
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,090
movements I think the camera also were

142
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:11,400
done in 3d see the marks but we'll use

143
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,830
modify a little bit like how everything

144
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:15,780
is growing and all the processing and

145
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:17,490
things like this so the thing is like

146
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:19,920
all these that which is like the demo

147
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:23,220
tape which is so it can easily be done

148
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:24,840
like with WebGL it's the same thing like

149
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:27,390
we just happen to be using like DirectX

150
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:30,600
back then but that could be like easily

151
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:34,560
done in WebGL and I'm I wish like the

152
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,150
web's were a little bit more like like

153
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:39,510
this these kind of graphics and the

154
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:41,670
pollen was the Ptolemies that we still

155
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:43,500
needs better tools to build this kind of

156
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,560
thing right now is everything is for

157
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,880
developers so far like we need more like

158
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,200
to be able to remove from each of the

159
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,440
people doing graphics and 3d stuff so

160
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,000
exactly one year ago comes eventually

161
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,890
one year ago I was invited to touch yes

162
00:09:57,890 --> 00:10:01,650
and I used that as an excuse to start

163
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:03,510
building like a library like it's a

164
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:05,310
building this tool like I wanted to

165
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:06,990
recreate a tool that I just show like

166
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:08,760
this is this previous one I wanted to

167
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:11,370
recreate this one I wanted to have it

168
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:14,430
again back but so I thought like what

169
00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:15,690
about trying to build is like in

170
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:18,060
JavaScript and make it open and making

171
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:19,410
like a Bella before everyone and see

172
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:22,050
what happens when a tool like this is

173
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:23,730
available for like people and people can

174
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:25,170
build like their own models for their

175
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:26,649
like effects

176
00:10:26,649 --> 00:10:28,569
anyone can play with it a little bit

177
00:10:28,569 --> 00:10:30,160
like flash was like an open-source flash

178
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:34,660
in a way so I built like a very like I

179
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:35,619
quickly built like I think it was

180
00:10:35,619 --> 00:10:37,660
probably like two weeks or something

181
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:40,240
also which is how to build like a

182
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,769
prototype of like a first version of it

183
00:10:43,769 --> 00:10:46,029
this is not a seven how it look like a

184
00:10:46,029 --> 00:10:47,470
looked at how many wars on this but I

185
00:10:47,470 --> 00:11:53,759
think it idea

186
00:11:53,769 --> 00:11:56,990
so this is this is using this was done

187
00:11:56,990 --> 00:11:58,879
thank you

188
00:11:58,879 --> 00:12:02,329
this was done using this shader effect

189
00:12:02,329 --> 00:12:03,740
like fragment shaders that you can find

190
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:05,870
on like a shot it's like shade the

191
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:09,199
toys a comma like GLSL sandbox so I

192
00:12:09,199 --> 00:12:12,199
think well I I give some credit here for

193
00:12:12,199 --> 00:12:14,180
the reasons that I took but I had to

194
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:17,180
build something very quickly so in this

195
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:19,339
case and I just built like some basic

196
00:12:19,339 --> 00:12:21,290
modules or you will pass any fragment

197
00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:23,240
shader and then a time or like some

198
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:25,819
properties to it and then do like a play

199
00:12:25,819 --> 00:12:30,079
them just in the right time so this at

200
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:31,399
this form that this soul was not very

201
00:12:31,399 --> 00:12:34,129
useful like it can only you know show

202
00:12:34,129 --> 00:12:36,319
the blocks and you can kind of jump to

203
00:12:36,319 --> 00:12:39,259
any point but for instance Mikey can

204
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:43,670
that's the way he only things they can

205
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:46,879
use like move the flash maybe this was

206
00:12:46,879 --> 00:12:48,290
just a simple module that it will just

207
00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:50,269
like to draw a quad on top of it with

208
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:52,880
some opacity and at the beginning will

209
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,470
be one and the ending will be zero so

210
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:56,300
just when you move if you are kind of

211
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:58,790
flashing the screen and the same thing

212
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:01,040
right here you can move like one that

213
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:04,189
effect explaining and but like that's

214
00:13:04,189 --> 00:13:06,050
that's pretty much what I have like a I

215
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:08,089
was saying that I will be nice if you

216
00:13:08,089 --> 00:13:08,990
click here and then you had some

217
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:11,060
properties there and that's about it but

218
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:12,889
like even besides the things like that

219
00:13:12,889 --> 00:13:18,439
but I that's pretty much all I had so so

220
00:13:18,439 --> 00:13:20,810
then it's ed much later there was this

221
00:13:20,810 --> 00:13:23,509
event in Spain like ESCO ESCO party

222
00:13:23,509 --> 00:13:25,490
which is is the random party that I used

223
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:30,410
to go like when I was 10 years ago and I

224
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:31,970
had I haven't done like for like maybe

225
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:35,360
four years or five years so this year

226
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,220
were like are maybe I can go like a LAN

227
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:40,009
party looks like this if anyone is not

228
00:13:40,009 --> 00:13:41,829
aware of this like it's a ton of people

229
00:13:41,829 --> 00:13:45,129
katana computers and in this one they do

230
00:13:45,129 --> 00:13:50,660
some demo swing competitions so I wanted

231
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:53,660
I thought going back to this one and see

232
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:57,250
if I correlate something

233
00:13:57,260 --> 00:14:00,170
and I send myself the challenge of like

234
00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:02,270
he is going with the Chromebook like

235
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:06,710
these $3 crumbled and see was I what I

236
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:08,960
could do with it like I kind of found it

237
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:11,120
interesting that this device this

238
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,370
machine had the same power that they the

239
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:14,990
computer that I was powering ten years

240
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:17,140
ago with the screen on there on the

241
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:19,580
compute on the big tower on the back and

242
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:21,290
now I could just carry over this is

243
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:22,760
super super to device and see what I can

244
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,440
do with this with this thing so I lock

245
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,960
myself in the room for like two days

246
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:30,110
before they contain competition and to

247
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:31,220
see what I called Oh like I only had one

248
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:33,770
song and then I had to build out of it

249
00:14:33,770 --> 00:14:35,210
something with it it was a bit

250
00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:37,610
challenging because this is running

251
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:39,830
Chrome OS and and whenever you're doing

252
00:14:39,830 --> 00:14:42,140
something with crumble any browser you

253
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:44,990
have some security limitations

254
00:14:44,990 --> 00:14:46,550
you cannot load textures so you can

255
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:50,540
unload some like even JSON files so I

256
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:53,930
had to basically have to use like lower

257
00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:55,340
like three tiers and use all the

258
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:56,900
primitives that they had available and

259
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:59,480
build something out of it so this is

260
00:14:59,480 --> 00:19:11,570
what I built

261
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:15,850
Thanks so was it oh wow

262
00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:17,890
it goes back well as an experiment on

263
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:20,290
this one I try adding like as if it was

264
00:19:20,290 --> 00:19:23,340
a video so you can forward to any point

265
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:27,850
in time if it allows me yeah like if it

266
00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:29,470
was any kind of idiot but the good thing

267
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:32,020
then the nice thing of this is that even

268
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:33,910
in these it happens that this resolution

269
00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:35,410
right now is pretty I don't I don't

270
00:19:35,410 --> 00:19:37,060
think I have done anything at such a

271
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:38,770
high resolution so in this case the good

272
00:19:38,770 --> 00:19:40,900
benefit is that if you had a video it

273
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:42,220
will look a little bit blurry but this

274
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:44,260
is still as crisp as the projector can

275
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:57,280
be so for this I just the same I just

276
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,980
the same version of the tool or the

277
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:01,690
editor that they have from the J's

278
00:20:01,690 --> 00:20:04,300
basically I just added a few things like

279
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:07,300
now I call like zoom in the timeline to

280
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:09,070
kind of navigate a little bit quicker

281
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:13,810
and maybe a co like resize the effects

282
00:20:13,810 --> 00:20:16,380
and mobile it a bit but uh but that's

283
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:19,540
actually I was also like we able to like

284
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:22,410
clone an effect so like if I had this

285
00:20:22,410 --> 00:20:25,000
like a I could have another flash there

286
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,220
if I wanted to make his move it out

287
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:32,590
towards when he goes away like whatever

288
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:37,330
and here you can also remove some and in

289
00:20:37,330 --> 00:20:38,830
this case it was actually useful because

290
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:40,930
whatever I was doing here and then I

291
00:20:40,930 --> 00:20:43,660
call like a sports so this which is

292
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:47,950
basically like a kind of format like I

293
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:51,280
still try to move define this is a JSON

294
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:55,150
format that then I run time whenever you

295
00:20:55,150 --> 00:20:56,890
using the editor button you can use a

296
00:20:56,890 --> 00:20:58,600
player and that's this is what the

297
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,580
player basically needs and also you also

298
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:02,610
need like the modules and is like this

299
00:21:02,610 --> 00:21:05,200
so from here I call like edit the whole

300
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,790
thing like duplicate things and explore

301
00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:07,610
it and

302
00:21:07,610 --> 00:21:10,160
it started to be able to be useful but

303
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:12,020
for instance if I wanted more if I

304
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:14,780
wanted to modify like any anything in it

305
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:18,710
like I still couldn't like change any

306
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:21,830
parameters from here so if I one here

307
00:21:21,830 --> 00:21:25,610
for instance if I wanted this in scene

308
00:21:25,610 --> 00:21:29,030
from module I had to go back to the code

309
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:35,330
which this is how it used to look here

310
00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:37,100
for instance you want to change instead

311
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:39,890
of being the Lighting's of the thing

312
00:21:39,890 --> 00:21:47,510
with I know what can I change yeah so

313
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:49,880
the having this red color like we can

314
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:54,230
just change it how to below then kind of

315
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:56,510
go back to the same place but now you

316
00:21:56,510 --> 00:21:58,900
can see that the lights around it is

317
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:02,060
yellow and I guess it will be binary

318
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:12,620
change also the sphere like this one

319
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:14,720
so now I said that having this rather

320
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,920
sing in the middle like we have it in in

321
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:19,590
jello and everything just looks like as

322
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:21,870
it used to be but you know and still

323
00:22:21,870 --> 00:22:24,060
like this is not a very nice process

324
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:25,590
like you still need to go back to the

325
00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:28,350
sublime modify the the effect and

326
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:30,150
everything and this is enough this is

327
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:31,290
not like it's something that you want to

328
00:22:31,290 --> 00:22:33,360
have like a graphic like a designer's

329
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:39,180
deserve so actually there was something

330
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:42,050
interesting for them

331
00:22:42,050 --> 00:22:44,160
another feature that I had to add for

332
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:46,470
this or that they managed were the

333
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:49,320
example like for this demo was so we're

334
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:53,250
swimming into the timeline we make for

335
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:55,770
instance for this part let's put the

336
00:22:55,770 --> 00:23:14,550
music very well think thinking that can

337
00:23:14,550 --> 00:23:16,140
be like kind of a pain I having some or

338
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:18,720
all those things but you can with the

339
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,520
audio Pia you can reduce the playback

340
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:33,930
rate this is basically how you think you

341
00:23:33,930 --> 00:23:35,190
keep listening to the whole thing it's a

342
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:38,220
very slow favorite rate and in your

343
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:40,020
listens it's kind of if the music wasn't

344
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:43,710
darker now it is cinema dark today I

345
00:23:43,710 --> 00:23:46,800
managed to get this thing and it's kind

346
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:57,390
of the basic of what I usually need

347
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:01,840
so four months later since then I was

348
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,970
invited here and then I used this as an

349
00:24:03,970 --> 00:24:05,650
excuse to add like more improvements to

350
00:24:05,650 --> 00:24:08,770
this so one of the things I like the

351
00:24:08,770 --> 00:24:10,300
first thing I want to do was like

352
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:13,300
friends in this case like now when I do

353
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:15,010
a click here now you can finally like

354
00:24:15,010 --> 00:24:19,960
modify you can modify the text in it

355
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,550
like you have some parameters of this

356
00:24:21,550 --> 00:24:23,740
thing so in this case we can just change

357
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:36,370
and for like no you're going to change

358
00:24:36,370 --> 00:24:38,380
it even one whenever it's playing if

359
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:40,270
that's something you want to do for some

360
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:45,040
reason

361
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:46,880
and to do a little bit more like

362
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,230
something interesting we can also move

363
00:24:48,230 --> 00:25:11,739
the camera to say something cheesy

364
00:25:11,749 --> 00:25:14,489
only have too many other promises this

365
00:25:14,489 --> 00:25:17,190
one like here we can change instead of

366
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:19,730
being the flashy and this kind of blue

367
00:25:19,730 --> 00:25:22,409
why we can change it to be like what

368
00:25:22,409 --> 00:25:24,539
about the color and we already see how

369
00:25:24,539 --> 00:25:40,049
it's that's what that was kind of the

370
00:25:40,049 --> 00:25:43,049
first thing then I all these that wasn't

371
00:25:43,049 --> 00:25:45,119
it's not like very nice like for

372
00:25:45,119 --> 00:25:47,639
instance in this scene we set up Anna

373
00:25:47,639 --> 00:25:50,190
you can say it like we set up the XY set

374
00:25:50,190 --> 00:25:52,799
the position where the camera starts and

375
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:54,600
the actual set of a position where the

376
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:57,389
camera ends and this is not like a very

377
00:25:57,389 --> 00:25:59,789
nice way of like animating things so so

378
00:25:59,789 --> 00:26:01,379
the next thing was implementing some

379
00:26:01,379 --> 00:26:03,869
sort of curves into it so you have like

380
00:26:03,869 --> 00:26:05,940
a camera position and then like on the

381
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:07,679
previous tools that we saw like you'll

382
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:09,179
have like an editor for the curves

383
00:26:09,179 --> 00:26:11,100
sadly the editor for the cases is I

384
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:12,059
still don't have it but the curves

385
00:26:12,059 --> 00:26:15,379
internally it's working and I have it

386
00:26:15,379 --> 00:26:18,239
actually I think was in this non the

387
00:26:18,239 --> 00:26:24,110
next one

388
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:27,070
yeah like in this one this color module

389
00:26:27,070 --> 00:26:31,600
has a dissipating but this color module

390
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:37,140
has a curve applied to it internally

391
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:45,280
let's see if I can get this work so

392
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:47,920
you'll see that the value it's

393
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:50,020
decreasing or like it's increased

394
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:51,370
decreased in actually because it just

395
00:26:51,370 --> 00:26:53,500
goes from like opaque full of fake black

396
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:56,680
to the trans friends so you can apply

397
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:58,720
any kind of curves internal like linear

398
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,340
curve the spine curves or any kind of

399
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:02,650
even my sinus weight to any kind of

400
00:27:02,650 --> 00:27:04,240
frequency to any value that you have on

401
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:09,190
the on the engine or the top and here

402
00:27:09,190 --> 00:27:11,890
now for instance in this effect not that

403
00:27:11,890 --> 00:27:13,300
yeah we have some parameters we can also

404
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:19,040
move we can move the timer for instance

405
00:27:19,050 --> 00:27:22,180
like if for whatever reason we we wanted

406
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:23,980
to try it we wanted to see how it looks

407
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:26,070
from here Mike

408
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:30,010
that's probably too close

409
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:35,660
I don't think from this one you want to

410
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:58,919
try something else

411
00:27:58,929 --> 00:28:01,910
so yeah like this first thing is still

412
00:28:01,910 --> 00:28:03,559
working progress I need to like another

413
00:28:03,559 --> 00:28:05,929
panel on like where the ten money's to

414
00:28:05,929 --> 00:28:08,720
be able to certainly try to do need to

415
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:11,270
decide how the format is and how it

416
00:28:11,270 --> 00:28:13,130
whether they're in sync with the block

417
00:28:13,130 --> 00:28:14,720
or whether they are like using their own

418
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:17,390
time or whatever but this is kind of

419
00:28:17,390 --> 00:28:18,500
something like this is kind of the

420
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:20,330
latest version and this is how it

421
00:28:20,330 --> 00:28:23,059
starting to work for the module like

422
00:28:23,059 --> 00:28:26,480
this week for the module system this

423
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:28,610
week I started to like I had something

424
00:28:28,610 --> 00:28:30,440
like really ugly before implemented it

425
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:32,120
was everything was like in in global

426
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:35,030
scope like you will define like like

427
00:28:35,030 --> 00:28:37,970
like image module equals function and

428
00:28:37,970 --> 00:28:39,980
then everything every other module knows

429
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:42,020
the name of the other modules so that

430
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:45,440
was obviously ugly and I'm this week I

431
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,900
started doing a new try to define a new

432
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:50,960
module code for it a module part of me

433
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:53,120
this is what I have so far but I had to

434
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,260
fill it that this is not the best thing

435
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:56,000
like probably something like requires

436
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,370
yes or like AMD or something that I had

437
00:28:58,370 --> 00:29:00,890
to look how is the best way to intern

438
00:29:00,890 --> 00:29:02,929
and all this stuff but this will be like

439
00:29:02,929 --> 00:29:04,669
a module like this code is like what

440
00:29:04,669 --> 00:29:07,400
what you will what you then like you

441
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:09,290
just a J's father you can drag into the

442
00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:11,510
tool and use that as a resource for

443
00:29:11,510 --> 00:29:13,160
anything like it can be like a flash it

444
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,570
can be like a 3tc and it has some

445
00:29:14,570 --> 00:29:16,850
parameters or whatever so this is kind

446
00:29:16,850 --> 00:29:18,770
of the basic of it like like a module

447
00:29:18,770 --> 00:29:21,770
has like parameters and any function

448
00:29:21,770 --> 00:29:23,840
that it is whatever you need to create

449
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:26,059
something or whatever it's like you need

450
00:29:26,059 --> 00:29:28,309
to initialize any kind of geometry so

451
00:29:28,309 --> 00:29:31,070
things like this the loads still not is

452
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:35,700
not implemented yet

453
00:29:35,710 --> 00:29:40,370
the start is whenever the effect that

454
00:29:40,370 --> 00:29:41,990
whenever the module is gonna be rendered

455
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:43,490
for the first time this is being called

456
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:46,130
so so you can setup your effect and then

457
00:29:46,130 --> 00:29:47,720
the update is just a method that is

458
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:50,090
called like every frame that the module

459
00:29:50,090 --> 00:29:52,400
is rendering and it's sending the

460
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,890
parameters it's like say the animation

461
00:29:54,890 --> 00:29:56,570
is moving or like there is some sort of

462
00:29:56,570 --> 00:29:58,580
movie for like core animation or

463
00:29:58,580 --> 00:30:00,110
anything like this but you get it from

464
00:30:00,110 --> 00:30:01,780
the parameters

465
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:06,220
so for instance this is how module looks

466
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:11,559
for just a single flats color like in

467
00:30:11,559 --> 00:30:13,570
this case I'm using three but this you

468
00:30:13,570 --> 00:30:15,160
can use whatever you want like it can be

469
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:17,110
done like for any other like any other

470
00:30:17,110 --> 00:30:18,850
library it like this is agnostic it

471
00:30:18,850 --> 00:30:20,380
doesn't it doesn't know what three J's

472
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:23,770
is so in this case for instance we're

473
00:30:23,770 --> 00:30:26,590
withdrawing this flat color and so so in

474
00:30:26,590 --> 00:30:28,809
3d one year what you want to do for like

475
00:30:28,809 --> 00:30:30,790
one during college is the plane is

476
00:30:30,790 --> 00:30:32,980
creating a orthographic camera which is

477
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:35,200
always going to be like this it has no

478
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,179
perspective and then you create a plane

479
00:30:37,179 --> 00:30:39,940
and then that plane has a color so in

480
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:42,070
this case we're creating a autographic

481
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:44,590
camera and then a scene then a material

482
00:30:44,590 --> 00:30:48,610
isn't select a material which is the one

483
00:30:48,610 --> 00:30:49,980
that we're going to change the color on

484
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:53,830
then create a plane geometry which is

485
00:30:53,830 --> 00:30:56,370
just a quad that we need to draw with

486
00:30:56,370 --> 00:30:58,720
like a mesh with the geometry in this

487
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:01,690
material so this in this is kind of ugly

488
00:31:01,690 --> 00:31:04,570
like and right now the this effect needs

489
00:31:04,570 --> 00:31:06,130
to know about the render where it is but

490
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:08,500
the runner is another module so this is

491
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:10,570
the dependency issue that I still need

492
00:31:10,570 --> 00:31:15,010
to work on and then all with all this

493
00:31:15,010 --> 00:31:17,919
set up and you have defined a module and

494
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:19,390
then you have the parameters that is

495
00:31:19,390 --> 00:31:22,360
like color put aside color and then like

496
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:23,530
this is the default value and you can

497
00:31:23,530 --> 00:31:25,750
specify some ranges especially for Matic

498
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:28,690
floats which is like a normal number of

499
00:31:28,690 --> 00:31:31,419
decimals so for flow will be like for

500
00:31:31,419 --> 00:31:35,679
like opacity and then in this case we

501
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:37,030
don't have a window needed start so we

502
00:31:37,030 --> 00:31:38,679
don't need in it or anything because

503
00:31:38,679 --> 00:31:40,960
it's always going to be there so this

504
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:44,770
this one has a update method that in

505
00:31:44,770 --> 00:31:46,690
every every time that is being called

506
00:31:46,690 --> 00:31:49,179
every render time is going to set the

507
00:31:49,179 --> 00:31:51,429
the color the material to whatever the

508
00:31:51,429 --> 00:31:53,559
parameter color is and that primary

509
00:31:53,559 --> 00:31:55,150
color don't change because we're kind of

510
00:31:55,150 --> 00:31:56,620
we have I mean we can have any curve

511
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:59,049
applied to it same thing with the passes

512
00:31:59,049 --> 00:32:00,490
it just has the opacity and then it

513
00:32:00,490 --> 00:32:01,059
renders

514
00:32:01,059 --> 00:32:03,760
so in this case we have like we have

515
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,200
like the weather what you'll run there

516
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,720
like kind of an on top of it which only

517
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:09,429
does initialization it doesn't really do

518
00:32:09,429 --> 00:32:11,230
anything an update and then it has this

519
00:32:11,230 --> 00:32:13,310
scene that it renders that scene and

520
00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:15,260
in this case you need to flush something

521
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:17,630
unitive like any flat color that it is

522
00:32:17,630 --> 00:32:18,890
another renderer

523
00:32:18,890 --> 00:32:21,890
with this sin and this is more less how

524
00:32:21,890 --> 00:32:25,190
it's looking so far so the next thing

525
00:32:25,190 --> 00:32:28,390
when I work which is kind of the obvious

526
00:32:28,390 --> 00:32:31,910
sorry it's kind of the obvious thing

527
00:32:31,910 --> 00:32:34,150
like yeah this is free interesting and

528
00:32:34,150 --> 00:32:36,410
really useful especially for me because

529
00:32:36,410 --> 00:32:38,390
I know how to build this thing on how to

530
00:32:38,390 --> 00:32:40,820
where all the parts are but it will be

531
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:43,580
nice if it was like something on the

532
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:45,860
edges for that you go here and then you

533
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:48,530
can use publish so publish is basically

534
00:32:48,530 --> 00:32:50,840
means exporting or creating a sip file

535
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:53,360
with the HTML file and everything that

536
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:54,770
you need so you can upload it to your

537
00:32:54,770 --> 00:32:56,960
website and then publish it on your

538
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:01,760
website and this is one it's not as easy

539
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:05,420
as it sounds like I'll try to work on it

540
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:07,790
for the like as the next thing also for

541
00:33:07,790 --> 00:33:09,350
like also the features editor need

542
00:33:09,350 --> 00:33:12,290
something like this yeah this is pretty

543
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:13,190
much what I have so far

544
00:33:13,190 --> 00:33:16,400
and that's it it's certain sources and

545
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:18,050
