[Music]

2
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:12,150
hey everyone so my name is Claudia I'm a

3
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:14,429
Mexican software engineer currently

4
00:00:14,429 --> 00:00:17,039
working for NPM so um a little bit of

5
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:19,590
context I'm actually from this city kaul

6
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:22,199
Monterrey Mexico and in case you don't

7
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:24,029
know where that is that's actually just

8
00:00:24,029 --> 00:00:26,310
in the north of Mexico very near the

9
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:28,949
States so what was happening in my life

10
00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:33,480
in 2014 so in 2014 I was getting my

11
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:36,270
degree in computer science and being out

12
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:39,270
of school I asked myself how can I

13
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:42,210
continue learning so that's when I

14
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:44,430
actually came across conference talks

15
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:47,550
online so this really sparked my

16
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:49,500
interest in tech meetups in my local

17
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,629
area the thing is that I realized they

18
00:00:51,629 --> 00:00:54,090
were not local meetups happening at all

19
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:58,379
actually there was only one so in 2015 I

20
00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:01,079
gave my first talk ever in this very

21
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:03,120
very small meetup in Monterrey called

22
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,189
JavaScript Monterrey and as you might

23
00:01:05,189 --> 00:01:07,409
notice it was a small it was normally 10

24
00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:10,740
to 15 people um this made me realize

25
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:13,290
something very important I was missing

26
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:18,689
out a lot of things but why and I really

27
00:01:18,689 --> 00:01:21,560
really want to highlight three reasons

28
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:25,439
why I believe he was very inconvenient

29
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:27,299
for me to stay in this city in Monterrey

30
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:30,689
so the first reason is this one Loeb

31
00:01:30,689 --> 00:01:34,259
community involvement so this is a graph

32
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:36,060
of all the conference's that are more or

33
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:39,390
less happening in 2018 and 2020 in the

34
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:40,890
graph speaks by itself

35
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:42,840
there are way more conferences happen in

36
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:45,180
Europe and in the u.s. than the rest of

37
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:45,890
the world

38
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:49,229
this is JS JS JavaScript conference is

39
00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:53,369
happening so the second reason is non

40
00:01:53,369 --> 00:01:56,969
competitive salaries in Latin America so

41
00:01:56,969 --> 00:02:01,219
the average monthly salary in Mexico is

42
00:02:01,219 --> 00:02:03,780
$745 this is what I what I was actually

43
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:07,170
making in my first job and these are

44
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:09,539
very I open or tweet by Juan Pablo

45
00:02:09,539 --> 00:02:11,550
Radhika he's one of the leaders of the

46
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:13,590
Colombian community and his

47
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:17,010
a hundred ticket $100 ticket is a 10% of

48
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:18,900
a Colombian developers monthly income

49
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:21,450
sometimes even more sponsors really help

50
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:24,780
in developing nations events so in that

51
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:28,439
fashion $100 ticket is 13% of Mexican

52
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:30,629
developers monthly income so I already

53
00:02:30,629 --> 00:02:31,920
mentioned that there are not a lot of

54
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,409
things happening in Latin America so on

55
00:02:34,409 --> 00:02:36,000
top of that if you won't actually go to

56
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,049
a conference you have to pay

57
00:02:37,049 --> 00:02:38,790
accomodation you have to pay the ticket

58
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:40,560
and you have to pay the flights so you

59
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,109
know we don't have a lot of options and

60
00:02:43,109 --> 00:02:45,569
the third one it's expensive

61
00:02:45,569 --> 00:02:48,180
infrastructure in Latin America so long

62
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:50,459
story short this means is that we're

63
00:02:50,459 --> 00:02:53,819
paying more for slower services so now

64
00:02:53,819 --> 00:02:56,370
that we have this three reasons in 2015

65
00:02:56,370 --> 00:02:59,579
I decided to move from Mexico and in

66
00:02:59,579 --> 00:03:02,909
2015 I moved to Paris an incredible

67
00:03:02,909 --> 00:03:04,169
thing that happened once I moved to

68
00:03:04,169 --> 00:03:07,469
Europe is diversity scholarships so in

69
00:03:07,469 --> 00:03:09,719
2015 I got a scholarship for J's

70
00:03:09,719 --> 00:03:12,419
computer and this is a quote that I

71
00:03:12,419 --> 00:03:14,489
really really love from Yoona that says

72
00:03:14,489 --> 00:03:16,139
scholarships aren't just about

73
00:03:16,139 --> 00:03:17,729
increasing diversity numbers or

74
00:03:17,729 --> 00:03:19,739
financial assistance they can change and

75
00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:22,709
attend in life they do they change mine

76
00:03:22,709 --> 00:03:25,560
so in this computer up 2015 I met an

77
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,840
amazing human being that really inspired

78
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,849
me and really motivated me to pursue my

79
00:03:29,849 --> 00:03:34,259
public speaking dreams so this led to

80
00:03:34,259 --> 00:03:37,439
this in 2016 16 I gave my first

81
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:39,659
international talk at Jes come Budapest

82
00:03:39,659 --> 00:03:41,970
and shout out to the descon organizers

83
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:44,009
because they believed in me I love them

84
00:03:44,009 --> 00:03:48,569
so funny stories well the edition after

85
00:03:48,569 --> 00:03:51,060
the one in which I was in first with a

86
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:53,250
scholarship I came back as a speaker

87
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:56,939
this time so it was a mind-blowing

88
00:03:56,939 --> 00:03:59,250
experience to be sharing the same stage

89
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:00,900
with the same person that the previous

90
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:02,609
year actually inspired me to be in the

91
00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:04,650
stage in the first place amazing

92
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:08,219
experience in the rest the rest is

93
00:04:08,219 --> 00:04:08,879
history

94
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:10,889
after this opportunity that I got which

95
00:04:10,889 --> 00:04:13,229
is calm Yura I attended more meet ups

96
00:04:13,229 --> 00:04:15,719
and stuff but all of these wouldn't have

97
00:04:15,719 --> 00:04:17,609
been possible without the help of that

98
00:04:17,609 --> 00:04:19,560
community without the meetups that I

99
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,030
attended and the conference's that I've

100
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:22,040
been to

101
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:24,020
what I really really just want to ask to

102
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:26,450
you is to help create these communities

103
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:28,850
for people that aren't as lucky as I was

104
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:31,280
to literally switch countries to sort of

105
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,860
search for these opportunities so what

106
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:36,410
can we actually do we cannot change in

107
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:38,300
tahrir bills we cannot change salaries

108
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:40,520
but we can help organizing and funding

109
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,310
meetups and conferences around the world

110
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:45,890
so please get involved attend your local

111
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:49,280
meetups help the organizers give back to

112
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,020
the community and this is just one of

113
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:53,240
the examples this is limit is you can

114
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,700
actually sponsor the Meetup Lima is in

115
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:56,150
Peru

116
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:59,380
one of the South American meetups and

117
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:02,380
spread the word help other communities

118
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:07,460
be built and with that being said I want

119
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:10,640
