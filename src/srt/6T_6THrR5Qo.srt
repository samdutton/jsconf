00:00:16,619 --> 00:00:20,490
that happens to me very often and I just

5
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:21,840
want to first a quick show of hands

6
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,180

7
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:28,560

8
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:34,230
their hands so I'm just gonna tell you I

9
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:37,710
get stuck this is me trying to install a

10
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:39,600
ruby gem on my computer and I have no

11
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,540
idea why it's not installing I guess

12
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:44,640
suck a lot this is me trying to build a

13
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,350
Mac OS app this is how I originally

14
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:48,660
started my career and it's not just

15
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:51,620
encoding I also get stuck while blogging

16
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:54,660
I you know sometimes it just takes a

17
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:57,600
while for inspiration to strike so I'm

18
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,370
just gonna tell you a short story about

19
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:01,199
getting stuck and how we can all relate

20
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:03,680
with that and do better for ourselves

21
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,580
it's the stories

22
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:07,500
sorry it's a drawing a hand-drawn story

23
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:10,710
but please note my drawing skills stop

24
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:12,990
developing by the time I hit seven so

25
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:15,960
please bear with me so these are our two

26
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:20,369
main characters let's call them Joanne -

27
00:01:20,369 --> 00:01:24,119
and it is a lovely day the Sun is out

28
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:26,700
the birds those are birds the birds are

29
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:30,030
singing and Joe's inside they're working

30
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:31,799
on their computer and they're kind of

31
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:33,600
annoyed because they encountered a bug

32
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,329
and they're just like I'm like I'm least

33
00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:38,610
close to fixing it and Joanne - comes in

34
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:40,829
and said hey here's an idea let's go on

35
00:01:40,829 --> 00:01:41,130
a walk

36
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:44,450
those are footsteps yeah

37
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:46,650
let's go on a walk I'm sure you can

38
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:48,630
clear head or whatever and she was like

39
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:51,150
hold on hold on I'm this close to fixing

40
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:54,300
it now what happened is that many many

41
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:57,600
hours later one thing I forgot to

42
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,140
mention ash wanted to take Joe on a walk

43
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:03,360
with their two lovely dogs right and

44
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,460
what happened is that many hours later

45
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:08,820
Joe was still at the computer ash was

46
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:10,830
not feeling that wild about it and came

47
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:13,170
over and said Joe I'm very very sad I

48
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:14,870
wish we'd gone on that walk and

49
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:17,310
unfortunately the poor dogs did not get

50
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:21,600
walked so I'm gonna tell you right off

51
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:25,470
the bat small spoiler that was me and

52
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:28,920
this happens to me all the time and it's

53
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,930
it's terrible because you know I get

54
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:33,720
stressed I get annoyed and the dogs

55
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,550
they're so sweet peace of my parents two

56
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:38,970
dogs they didn't get walked and but what

57
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:41,100
happens is one search wise I'll just be

58
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:43,440
like you know what I'll do it let's

59
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,140
let's go on that walk and being a person

60
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:47,790
who has a hard time getting bugs out of

61
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:49,470
their head I'm just like thinking of a

62
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:51,870
million ways you know I with Mac OS Ives

63
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:53,940
there's lots of memory leaks going on

64
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:56,010
and you know I struggle with it and then

65
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:57,750
all of a sudden the bang that's a

66
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:00,090
lightbulb but bang it gets the idea

67
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:02,730
comes into my head I hurry home and I

68
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:06,450
try and what do you know I fixed it now

69
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:12,900
I really short hair so now that for me

70
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:15,510
was a walk and of course to everybody it

71
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:17,790
doesn't have to be a walk it can be you

72
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:19,709
know going for a cup of coffee lately

73
00:03:19,709 --> 00:03:22,110
I've been calling the public pool close

74
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:24,780
to my house my best debugging tool

75
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:27,150
because it you know you just go there

76
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:28,650
for half an hour and then you just

77
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:30,600
figure stuff out it doesn't have to be

78
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,430
pool it can be a cup of tea it can be

79
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:34,769
chatting to a friend it can be going for

80
00:03:34,769 --> 00:03:37,440
a run maybe painting a picture playing

81
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,450
some video games taking a nap playing

82
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:43,709
with puppies or traveling what is

83
00:03:43,709 --> 00:03:45,750
important is I find that you step away

84
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:47,130
from your environment for a little bit

85
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:49,260
and just let let the background in your

86
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:52,650
mind just just mull things over so what

87
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:54,180
I've learned over the years is that you

88
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:56,400
know it does happen you are going to get

89
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,360
stuck

90
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,210
and I have to remember I eventually will

91
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:01,980
fix the problem and if I don't fix the

92
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:03,630
problems I will get the help I need to

93
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:07,050
fix the problem and you know my most

94
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:08,520
important point is one below if I'm

95
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,380
gonna be stuck and unproductive I might

96
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:13,440
as well enjoy that time so that's it
