1
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:21,970

I said this is a Raspberry Pi it's a $25

2
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:25,150
computer and I'm gonna plug it into this

3
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:28,150
5 volts USB cable that I had spare from

4
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:32,949
my on a broken phone and also to the

5
00:00:32,949 --> 00:00:39,180
screen here and it's it's booting into a

6
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:43,440
Debian Linux system hopefully at least

7
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:48,970
and basically it's reading the system

8
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:52,059
from an SD card can we get the video or

9
00:00:52,059 --> 00:01:00,280
oh we don't get the video so let's

10
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:05,320
believing that has video what's working

11
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:08,470
fine this is like the pattern of tech

12
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:09,700
stuff not working

13
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:18,789
it seems let's try again this cable

14
00:01:18,789 --> 00:01:31,450
looks good ah perfect

15
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:34,740
so it's booting this Debian Linux

16
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:40,149
reading it from an SD card my name is

17
00:01:40,149 --> 00:01:41,259
Thomas Cooper he mentioned that already

18
00:01:41,259 --> 00:01:46,330
um I'm working at Nokia and actually on

19
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:48,789
automotive it's pretty unrelated but

20
00:01:48,789 --> 00:01:49,810
it's and better technology as well as

21
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:52,119
well I'm trying to put JavaScript into

22
00:01:52,119 --> 00:01:56,830
cars but that's the first step

23
00:01:56,830 --> 00:02:03,489
so the the Raspberry Pi well let's start

24
00:02:03,489 --> 00:02:06,780
this way so when I when I am grew up I

25
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:08,619
learning to program was actually

26
00:02:08,619 --> 00:02:10,899
connected to wanting to play computer

27
00:02:10,899 --> 00:02:11,580
games

28
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:18,819
let me quickly so so I had a zx81

29
00:02:18,819 --> 00:02:20,920
computer and there wasn't like you

30
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,660
couldn't really go and biased games for

31
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:25,420
it so I had to do is get these magazines

32
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:27,760
copy the code of the games and then

33
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,230
compile them and run them on

34
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:32,319
on the small computer and and I learned

35
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,870
programming because I wanted to play

36
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:42,580
games and that that pattern that worked

37
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:44,110
for me I mean when I went to university

38
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:45,730
I was actually I had mastered three

39
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:47,290
programming languages there wasn't much

40
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:48,910
programming that I could be told at

41
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:50,890
least in the early semesters because and

42
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:52,480
that was there was a pattern at least in

43
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,890
my generation of a lot of people that

44
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:56,319
were came to went to university to study

45
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:57,700
computer science but they could already

46
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:00,959
write code now if you look at kids today

47
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:04,840
the gaming has moved to to these gaming

48
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:07,269
consoles and these these gaming systems

49
00:03:07,269 --> 00:03:09,670
by design are designed as as closed

50
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:13,120
systems you can't really easily write

51
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,750
your own code for them you can't really

52
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:17,950
fiddle with the electronics in them and

53
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:21,790
so forth so that opportunity for me to

54
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:24,190
kind of learn to write code because I

55
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:25,959
wanted to play games it's not there for

56
00:03:25,959 --> 00:03:29,500
kids of our age and according to this

57
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,720
gentleman even Upton who's the

58
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:34,660
co-creator of the Raspberry Pi and also

59
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:36,070
works at Cambridge University you can

60
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:38,410
see that in the applicants at university

61
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:39,970
for computer science so there the

62
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:41,920
numbers have gone down for him and I

63
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,660
don't know if that's a global pattern or

64
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:46,480
just Cambridge and also there the

65
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,220
knowledge that that students have at

66
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:50,140
university or the pre pre knowledge that

67
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:51,549
students have at university has went

68
00:03:51,549 --> 00:03:53,590
down and what he started to do is think

69
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:55,989
about okay how can I create a computer

70
00:03:55,989 --> 00:03:58,989
that is cheap and easy to use for

71
00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:00,430
children that they can use to fill

72
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:03,880
around so something like the child's

73
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:06,670
bicycle compared to the to the family

74
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:09,400
car so you can't recount all can't

75
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,650
believe like well you don't really want

76
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:14,799
to break the family PC to to the kid

77
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:16,989
like to learn programming or anything or

78
00:04:16,989 --> 00:04:18,850
learn how to install windows and so

79
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:22,740
forth and then that is kind of the idea

80
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:26,169
it's it's in the PI is in pretty early

81
00:04:26,169 --> 00:04:30,070
stage so I'm not sure if it is yet that

82
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:31,360
thing for children to do but it is you

83
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,970
can see things like this so this is like

84
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:36,390
the child building a case for the PI

85
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:40,659
actually I don't have one so that's kind

86
00:04:40,659 --> 00:04:41,890
of the kind of feeling they're looking

87
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:42,750
for

88
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,960
you look at the pie that's the board

89
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:48,150
it's it has pretty much everything you

90
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:50,940
need to connect it to a TV so it has

91
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:53,520
this HDMI plug down there it has an

92
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,070
s-video if you have an old-school TV it

93
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:58,320
doesn't have VGA which was like some

94
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,910
trouble to connect it here but it worked

95
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:02,280
finally it has audio it has at least

96
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:05,220
this one which is actually $35 has a

97
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:07,470
network adapter as well the the cheaper

98
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:12,810
one doesn't have it that has USB the the

99
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:14,670
CPU of this is for twenty-five dollars

100
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:16,110
you can't really expect much but this

101
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:21,570
it's this thing it's an arm 11 and it's

102
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:23,640
it's like clocked at I think 700

103
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:26,250
megahertz or something like that which

104
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:28,200
is like arm 11 I don't know how how much

105
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,460
you know embedded about a minute but

106
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:31,850
it's relatively Slocombe

107
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:35,880
CPU is like at the range of like free

108
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:40,260
iphone one free iphone one but the CPU

109
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:44,610
actually if the of that like well it's

110
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:47,730
like I think I'm 12 by 12 millimeter

111
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:51,300
size on there of that 12 by 12

112
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:54,000
millimeter size to square millimeters

113
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,680
only are the CPU and the rest of that

114
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,050
thing is actually GPU which is pretty

115
00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:02,940
powerful so it can do full HD in 60fps

116
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:05,220
pretty much on that on that small thing

117
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:06,570
and actually the presentation that

118
00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:08,700
you're seeing is running on that thing

119
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:10,590
and it is actually I'm rendering it in

120
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:12,750
Full HD it's just scaled down because

121
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:17,250
that system can't do full HD so it's

122
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:20,190
like it's it's it's pretty performant

123
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:22,620
GPU but then if you put do a lot of

124
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:26,030
things on the CPU it's it's not as great

125
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:28,650
and but you can't run X Windows on this

126
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:30,840
you can run most alone it's just not as

127
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:34,500
great as this stuff so what I'm using to

128
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,420
get JavaScript on this is cute which is

129
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:39,720
actually a C++ framework it's it's

130
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:42,840
pretty old like 20 years but it's like

131
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,330
it's been evolving over these 20 years

132
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:48,990
it's open source and it has like its for

133
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:51,210
instance the WebKit like Apple took at

134
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:53,790
some point took WebKit out of the cute

135
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:55,560
framework like I don't know 10 years ago

136
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,490
or whatever

137
00:06:56,490 --> 00:06:58,470
so it like it's it's the route to many

138
00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:01,170
systems but it's been evolving and the

139
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:02,520
latest version that I'm using is cute

140
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:05,310
five and that has undergone like a

141
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:07,800
complete rewrite of the of the graphics

142
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:11,670
pipeline so everything is put onto the

143
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:12,090
GPU

144
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:14,870
Lalli all the objects are basically and

145
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:19,380
textures and the day they actually went

146
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:22,410
away from using C++ to define the UI and

147
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:25,650
into something called cute quick which

148
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:28,740
is actually a UI markup language that is

149
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:32,550
built like looks a little bit like SCSS

150
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:35,640
so it's not it's not the XML based but

151
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:38,310
it's essentially still a tree it uses

152
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:41,640
JavaScript for scripting and it does

153
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:43,950
that different than what HTML does so

154
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:46,590
really the all the nodes in there are

155
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:48,830
basically you can put JavaScript code

156
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:51,600
actually they are JavaScript the at

157
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,710
least every all the values are

158
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:56,280
essentially JavaScript and it is - that

159
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:59,070
also different to a browser the the

160
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:01,740
elements that there's no no sandboxing

161
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:05,580
between the markup

162
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:09,150
scripting world and c++ so you can very

163
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:11,700
easily build something and C++ and I

164
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:14,220
expose it into key ml which is three ml

165
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:16,170
by the way steam markup language of cute

166
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:20,250
quick and there's other nice things like

167
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:22,800
shaders and like html5 canvas and

168
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,670
particles and stuff like that so that's

169
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:28,250
a very simple

170
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:32,640
qml program what it does is create a

171
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:37,350
rectangle with a pink color at a width

172
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:40,350
and hate and you can you can set like

173
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:41,880
all the things to the right of the

174
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,590
Cullens are actually javascript so i can

175
00:08:43,590 --> 00:09:04,040
do with x 2 here or pi x

176
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:17,759
so I just squared you can to define the

177
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:19,829
markup you can then like add notes to as

178
00:09:19,829 --> 00:09:21,629
children's over let's put a text note

179
00:09:21,629 --> 00:09:54,239
there some text white then we can anchor

180
00:09:54,239 --> 00:09:57,239
it to I get it so basically I use

181
00:09:57,239 --> 00:09:59,759
anchors to position things so I incur

182
00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:04,860
this to the parent right and it should

183
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:42,720
anchor the right of it don't need that

184
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:49,619
anyway so okay so there's other

185
00:10:49,619 --> 00:10:52,589
properties where we can put the radius

186
00:10:52,589 --> 00:11:00,179
there let me give it round or corners or

187
00:11:00,179 --> 00:11:11,869
we can rotate it 30 degrees you can also

188
00:11:11,869 --> 00:11:15,360
instead of just putting numbers there so

189
00:11:15,360 --> 00:12:21,749
we can do something like so for instance

190
00:12:21,749 --> 00:12:23,669
I could again like this all these

191
00:12:23,669 --> 00:12:30,569
properties are bound on so let's give if

192
00:12:30,569 --> 00:12:33,809
you give an ID to to an element here it

193
00:12:33,809 --> 00:12:36,029
actually becomes an object in JavaScript

194
00:12:36,029 --> 00:12:41,459
so this is all right text and then I can

195
00:12:41,459 --> 00:12:53,639
say here I don't need so you can even if

196
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:56,039
he if things are animated the property

197
00:12:56,039 --> 00:12:58,529
bindings will apply to those and you can

198
00:12:58,529 --> 00:13:02,369
even put a function here so you can just

199
00:13:02,369 --> 00:13:03,929
leave away the function keyword because

200
00:13:03,929 --> 00:13:06,839
they don't get parameters because they

201
00:13:06,839 --> 00:13:09,119
basically just supposed to return value

202
00:13:09,119 --> 00:13:11,480
so you can also put kind of value here

203
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:15,270
or do things like like

204
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:20,920
ten times the rotation and again like in

205
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:23,580
in cute quick

206
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:26,350
it's like observing all the all the

207
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:28,060
properties that are changing and then

208
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:30,130
whenever something changes the

209
00:13:30,130 --> 00:13:33,340
javascript is reevaluated and the engine

210
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:41,590
inside there is v8 cause okay so that's

211
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:43,690
that's like at least a simple quick

212
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:49,390
program you can also put shaders there

213
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:51,490
so this is a shader that actually has

214
00:13:51,490 --> 00:14:03,570
commented most of the code out so I

215
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:06,070
think most of you heard about shaders

216
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:07,870
but basically it's like it's similar to

217
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:09,790
the stuff you get in WebGL so it's GLSL

218
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:12,070
that is built-in and you can just for a

219
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:13,690
note again like the straight a' effect

220
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:17,650
is a note a special note that allows to

221
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:20,830
have a shader there's like the property

222
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:22,360
that i'm defining here which like again

223
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,800
you could find properties that have

224
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:26,260
types which are becoming available in

225
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:27,760
javascript but also into in the shader

226
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:30,430
so this property is a real value of time

227
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:34,180
and that i'm using here in the shader

228
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:39,510
and then there's like this cute specific

229
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:43,030
text cord property which is exposed into

230
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:49,000
the shader which gives the pixel of that

231
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,230
should be rendered it is for the

232
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:51,520
fragment shader the fragment shader is

233
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:54,220
essentially a small program that is run

234
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:56,590
for every pixel in this green sorry for

235
00:14:56,590 --> 00:15:01,450
a full HD it's like 1920 by 1080 by 60

236
00:15:01,450 --> 00:15:04,300
years it's running at 60 frames per

237
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:07,420
second times per second so it's like 120

238
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:08,620
million times or something like that

239
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:13,480
that this is run and at the moment it's

240
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:17,620
just like using the X&Y position to for

241
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:19,660
to create a color like the for the red

242
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:21,730
channel and the green channel of the

243
00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:24,820
color and then blue is there black and

244
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:27,970
then there's 50% opacity on it so

245
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:28,780
instead of that

246
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:30,610
let's just enable this code because I

247
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:33,490
didn't want to write it myself so let's

248
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:42,100
put this out just to show what you can

249
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:43,780
do with like shaders so this this is

250
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:48,170
essentially just a couple of sine curves

251
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:51,790
like put and put on on the on the screen

252
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:54,100
with I'm gradients so you can look like

253
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:55,960
this there's a sign here that uses the

254
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:58,240
time again which is a number animation

255
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:01,210
up here so if you if we decrease the

256
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:05,460
duration it should run a lot faster and

257
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:10,120
then there's a there's a value computed

258
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:12,730
out of the two positions which is

259
00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:14,680
becoming the color once we apply a

260
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:18,940
square root on it slightly modified

261
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:23,350
example I found on some WebGL page okay

262
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:26,050
so let's get to do more interesting

263
00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:29,530
stuff so in addition to this GPU and and

264
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:31,660
the capability run like Linux on it and

265
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:34,540
programs for Linux on it this thing is

266
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:36,430
also GPIO pins and you just heard about

267
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:39,940
them in the talk before lunch or is that

268
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:41,710
most of you have so it's essentially

269
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:44,410
these are programmable pins that you can

270
00:16:44,410 --> 00:16:48,700
like set ask make like three volts

271
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:51,940
voltage on or no no voltage and you can

272
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:54,940
just put stuff on them so he can have

273
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:57,130
LEDs blinking and we can have serial

274
00:16:57,130 --> 00:16:58,900
communication there's like I squared C

275
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:01,600
which is another like communication

276
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,480
protocol for like these embedded devices

277
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:07,930
or microcontrollers and you can also

278
00:17:07,930 --> 00:17:11,620
read data and you can generate analog

279
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:14,230
curves for data to like create audio or

280
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:17,740
things like that so like these these

281
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:20,740
things are pretty much just exposed on

282
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:22,500
the board if there isn't there's much

283
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,880
usage on them yet but at least people

284
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,230
have been started building around things

285
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:31,810
around them and at the moment it's it's

286
00:17:31,810 --> 00:17:34,960
really easy to to toast the board with

287
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,210
them if you if you just get them like

288
00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:38,950
short circuits something or give them

289
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:41,200
too much voltage you'll you'll fry the

290
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,700
pie there's like the

291
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:46,030
like another open-source project to to

292
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:47,710
build a device that you can plug on that

293
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:52,120
like makes this more more secure and I

294
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:54,060
haven't gotten that yet so I actually

295
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:57,660
Friday was my Friday I am fried to pies

296
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:00,250
and then went a little bit panicked

297
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:03,520
because those were my only two and I had

298
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:07,990
this presentation coming so and I said

299
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:11,710
oh no I have to go here so this thing

300
00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:15,850
here is like a nice sandwich that I

301
00:18:15,850 --> 00:18:20,380
built to protect the pins and it's too

302
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:22,000
ugly to actually explain what it's doing

303
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,180
but basically it's it's like reducing

304
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:27,010
the voltage and I'm just going to put

305
00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:34,300
this on here little quick and then first

306
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:37,090
thing I want to show is just like how to

307
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:41,730
control a simple LED with the pins so

308
00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:46,420
it's just this is an LED and I want to

309
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:53,740
give it power yeah this is this is

310
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:56,430
actually supposedly a very bright LED so

311
00:18:56,430 --> 00:18:59,520
if you look into the light you will die

312
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:02,650
but maybe it's bright enough here and

313
00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:06,780
then we can try this is actually not yet

314
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:10,660
thing I want to show so it's just

315
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:12,550
quickly get a shell here so this again

316
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:17,470
like is like a pretty much shell written

317
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:21,250
in qml and JavaScript and some C++ you

318
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:24,330
can also see the can you see there's the

319
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:26,650
particle effect there another qml

320
00:19:26,650 --> 00:19:28,690
feature you can add they're a little bit

321
00:19:28,690 --> 00:19:32,520
crazy but anyway so what I would hope

322
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:39,820
happens now if I do detect yeah so it

323
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:45,910
found my LED so it's this initialize

324
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:50,490
this my quick

325
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:53,890
okay so it's black so now we can start

326
00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:57,440
so what I can do with this LEDs is like

327
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,450
just send RGB values to it and it's a

328
00:19:59,450 --> 00:20:02,750
little bit fragile so I'm not gonna but

329
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:05,510
easy you can I wrote this small script

330
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:08,500
which again is using shell like there's

331
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,700
commands that come with Linux to just

332
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:12,170
communicate with it so let's look at

333
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:26,480
this it's this simple shells which is

334
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:29,090
just this I to see said come on is

335
00:20:29,090 --> 00:20:31,100
really crazy but busy it's just taking

336
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:32,840
an RGB value and then puts it on the

337
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:36,740
right formats it's right to the i2c set

338
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:47,780
up there can be called so value so let's

339
00:20:47,780 --> 00:21:00,860
say we want to have red as you can see

340
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:06,140
there the red is blowing other things

341
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:12,230
like let's say white why it is actually

342
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:14,570
like it's three LEDs I don't know well

343
00:21:14,570 --> 00:21:17,380
this can be seen but it's basically

344
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:20,180
adding these up so this is this is nice

345
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:23,030
but then we don't really it's it's like

346
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:24,140
I'm using the shell I'm not using

347
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:26,120
javascript so it's a little bit boring

348
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:30,410
so let's try to get Electra exposed this

349
00:21:30,410 --> 00:21:34,580
this stuff into JavaScript so this is or

350
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:36,770
to qml actually i should say this is

351
00:21:36,770 --> 00:21:39,610
what you have to do basically there's

352
00:21:39,610 --> 00:21:41,960
one class that you have to write which

353
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:46,460
is creating an item in the in the acute

354
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:48,260
quick world which is this calling it

355
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:52,580
GPIO so it's extending a cute quick item

356
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:54,650
it's like there's some boilerplate you

357
00:21:54,650 --> 00:21:55,940
object stuff that you have to add which

358
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:59,390
is just giving this like introspection K

359
00:21:59,390 --> 00:22:01,570
this class C++ class introspection

360
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:03,830
capabilities

361
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:07,390
and then there's a constructor and this

362
00:22:07,390 --> 00:22:10,100
digitalwrite function up there is

363
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:12,080
actually the the function that calls

364
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,870
that does the system cause to to write

365
00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:20,540
something to the GPIO which is like I

366
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:22,190
found that in the documentation for this

367
00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:24,410
chipset and then another class you have

368
00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:27,470
to write which is just this plugin down

369
00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:29,750
there which creates a plug-in for qml

370
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:32,650
and registers the GPIO type down there

371
00:22:32,650 --> 00:22:37,430
under the name GPIO so the second thing

372
00:22:37,430 --> 00:22:39,830
you would only have to do once per thing

373
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:43,490
that you want to expose the others the

374
00:22:43,490 --> 00:22:44,810
classes you would hit right and then if

375
00:22:44,810 --> 00:22:47,060
you this Q and vocable actually tells us

376
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:48,560
that this function should be in vocable

377
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:52,640
from the cute quick JavaScript world you

378
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:55,070
canyou can also have give add properties

379
00:22:55,070 --> 00:22:57,050
to these items and do more things or

380
00:22:57,050 --> 00:23:01,760
like do the inverse direction but just

381
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,560
for this simple thing this should allow

382
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:06,770
us to to write stuff and now I'm not

383
00:23:06,770 --> 00:23:09,050
gonna compile this because it's it's

384
00:23:09,050 --> 00:23:10,610
gonna be too nasty but basically the

385
00:23:10,610 --> 00:23:14,660
idea is to use this for something more

386
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:17,480
and since this thing was made for kids I

387
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:19,520
thought I go into a toy store and bought

388
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:23,600
this small thing to play music and then

389
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:29,540
build this thing which is like a bunch

390
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:32,690
of like electromagnets with small

391
00:23:32,690 --> 00:23:35,230
hammers and they are called solenoids

392
00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:39,740
basically its coil that like draws

393
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:44,690
Cullen was current on a on a like this

394
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:46,400
this hammer and then pulls it down if

395
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,950
you if you apply power to it and if you

396
00:23:48,950 --> 00:23:51,230
don't apply power there's a small spring

397
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:56,000
that pulls it back up and this crazy lis

398
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,740
great Woodward actually fits perfectly

399
00:23:57,740 --> 00:24:04,990
on my instrument and then these wires

400
00:24:04,990 --> 00:24:08,480
actually go to this thing the thing with

401
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,950
these coils is that they actually draw a

402
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:12,380
lot of power so this this these run at

403
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:15,290
24 volts makes you should put it this

404
00:24:15,290 --> 00:24:16,850
way so you can see it better

405
00:24:16,850 --> 00:24:20,030
so no way to like powered of the three

406
00:24:20,030 --> 00:24:22,640
vaults that you get out of the out of

407
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:25,580
the Raspberry Pi and if you try or if

408
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:27,710
you make mistakes then you have a

409
00:24:27,710 --> 00:24:31,190
raspberry fry which I don't suggest to

410
00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:34,040
do one so instead of that I have this is

411
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,630
like old

412
00:24:35,630 --> 00:24:39,410
oops Oh notebook power Deborah here that

413
00:24:39,410 --> 00:24:41,420
should power them and then there's this

414
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:46,120
insulation circuit here that should like

415
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:50,930
maybe there's like a Darlington switch

416
00:24:50,930 --> 00:24:53,660
that like allows to power a lot of power

417
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:56,240
to go run through without harming the

418
00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:02,840
pins so this is all powered and we have

419
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:42,440
to wire this now let's think so if so I

420
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:48,320
have this this GPIO element and there's

421
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:51,290
there's a well we just had saw there's a

422
00:25:51,290 --> 00:25:53,420
digital write function that that allows

423
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:56,890
to to write like set a pin to higher low

424
00:25:56,890 --> 00:26:03,500
so this is this is just like my first

425
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:05,960
song so what I'd like to have is like

426
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:07,730
this this function I would want to call

427
00:26:07,730 --> 00:26:09,410
this function which or I want to

428
00:26:09,410 --> 00:26:11,480
something to call this function and then

429
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:14,300
run through this this song here which is

430
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:16,360
just a bunch of nodes and then the space

431
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:19,660
character should is this space thing so

432
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:22,130
and this space character should say like

433
00:26:22,130 --> 00:26:23,960
okay there's actually nothing to play so

434
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:26,390
the ideas have something that every

435
00:26:26,390 --> 00:26:29,180
whatever second iterates through the

436
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:30,500
string and then looks at what

437
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:32,360
what is the current note and then place

438
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:37,550
that now in EML is like it has

439
00:26:37,550 --> 00:26:39,710
JavaScript but it doesn't have all the

440
00:26:39,710 --> 00:26:42,620
things that the browser has so timers

441
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:44,120
are one of the things that are done

442
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:47,600
differently in cute quick the way they

443
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:50,780
are done is that you just add a timer

444
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:59,180
there that has an interval let's say we

445
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:01,310
want to play every 200 milliseconds

446
00:27:01,310 --> 00:27:07,080
I want to iterate over 200 milliseconds

447
00:27:07,090 --> 00:27:14,930
and should actually be repeating and

448
00:27:14,930 --> 00:27:21,410
then there's a function or signal that

449
00:27:21,410 --> 00:27:24,280
is called which is on trigger and that

450
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:27,320
actually does like trigger whenever

451
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:31,330
there the timer hits and this actually

452
00:27:31,330 --> 00:27:44,810
should just be our play next call okay

453
00:27:44,810 --> 00:27:46,490
so now we should have a timer that halts

454
00:27:46,490 --> 00:27:50,120
this function and then this function

455
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:54,260
should play a tone and now if I set this

456
00:27:54,260 --> 00:28:09,560
let's actually do this so that the this

457
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:14,810
pin map hash map that Harry there just

458
00:28:14,810 --> 00:28:18,890
Maps the maps to the notes to the pins

459
00:28:18,890 --> 00:28:31,940
on the PI so I want and then set at 1

460
00:28:31,950 --> 00:28:59,649
let's put this away for now what's that

461
00:28:59,649 --> 00:29:15,880
Oh Oh something's wrong it's like not

462
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:21,250
not a very decent way to enough debug

463
00:29:21,250 --> 00:29:28,929
but oh okay control see was not a good

464
00:29:28,929 --> 00:29:43,750
idea let's start from scratch how much

465
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:45,809
time do we have

466
00:29:45,809 --> 00:29:58,320
so again we need a timer on triggered

467
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:34,940
oddly next enter power 200 should repeat

468
00:30:34,950 --> 00:30:37,930
it should be running mm-hmm

469
00:30:37,930 --> 00:30:56,330
let's use this later and then since the

470
00:30:56,340 --> 00:31:01,480
let's take this out for now I just want

471
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:03,010
to get this thing hammering at least

472
00:31:03,010 --> 00:31:06,450
once so you see this and I'm kind of

473
00:31:06,450 --> 00:31:33,390
confident that it works so okay so

474
00:31:33,390 --> 00:31:35,560
impressive isn't it but that's basically

475
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:39,160
now I wrote one but that one remains set

476
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:42,040
and it's not going up again and that

477
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:45,460
there's no real tone so if I said send a

478
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:47,380
zero again it goes up again so what we

479
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:50,950
have to do is have something that

480
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:52,780
actually moves the hammer down really

481
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:55,000
quick and then moves it up right away so

482
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,030
that that one timer won't really kick it

483
00:31:58,030 --> 00:31:59,650
because we don't have well this is it's

484
00:31:59,650 --> 00:32:02,470
JavaScript so it's a vent driven so we

485
00:32:02,470 --> 00:32:04,230
don't have a delay function or anything

486
00:32:04,230 --> 00:32:11,710
so we need another timer and then that

487
00:32:11,710 --> 00:32:14,770
timer should just run really short so

488
00:32:14,770 --> 00:32:23,360
let's say one millisecond oh sorry

489
00:32:23,370 --> 00:32:27,460
I'll okay let me let's do this in two

490
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:32,800
minutes I'm gonna be quick I'm just cue

491
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,450
Mishnah wow this is this is gonna be

492
00:32:34,450 --> 00:32:39,880
better maybe not yeah um okay I'm gonna

493
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:44,200
run so we want this and then

494
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:56,700
on triggered we want to digital right Oh

495
00:32:56,700 --> 00:33:03,399
deep the note that I had and then then a

496
00:33:03,399 --> 00:33:08,529
zero and the note we don't we don't

497
00:33:08,529 --> 00:33:10,210
really well kind of we have to pass a

498
00:33:10,210 --> 00:33:12,850
parameter into this the best way to do

499
00:33:12,850 --> 00:33:14,049
this is probably just by adding a

500
00:33:14,049 --> 00:33:19,000
property here that is accessible and

501
00:33:19,000 --> 00:34:24,020
then give this a let's check okay

502
00:34:24,030 --> 00:34:39,590
I guess I won't get this working in time

503
00:34:39,590 --> 00:34:42,330
okay so that's just imagine that it

504
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:47,429
works it was working but I just don't

505
00:34:47,429 --> 00:34:49,409
get this and I don't have really have a

506
00:34:49,409 --> 00:34:52,530
backup that I could just put in and have

507
00:34:52,530 --> 00:34:56,490
playing I think or do I actually I do

508
00:34:56,490 --> 00:34:58,260
okay so if we have at least 10 more

509
00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:04,140
seconds that's quickly just to show that

510
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:37,660
this can work

511
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:42,840
okay maybe not I'm sorry but then if you

512
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:50,830
if you want to play music

513
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:54,210
check out Roth peopIe awesome I live

514
00:35:54,210 --> 00:35:55,560
coding which does not kill us only makes

515
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:56,250
us stronger

516
00:35:56,250 --> 00:35:58,320
yeah maybe you could is it possible you

517
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:59,700
could even take this entire set up

518
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:03,120
outside and and then yeah yeah we can't

519
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:05,070
get yeah yeah if we got a break coming

520
00:36:05,070 --> 00:36:07,500
up in two more presentations maybe yeah

521
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:10,800
alright so demo to be continued outside
