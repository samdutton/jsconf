00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:09,590

thank you I'm super excited to be here

2
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:12,599
today I want to start by telling you a

3
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:17,460
story in this story is Jake Jake's the

4
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:20,039
software engineer and he's currently

5
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:21,510
working on an ambitious new web

6
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:23,070
application and he and his team are

7
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:26,460
super excited about the project however

8
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:28,740
as often happens it's a few weeks behind

9
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:30,480
schedule and they just had to spend a

10
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,809
long week wrapping up the key feature

11
00:00:32,809 --> 00:00:36,899
now it's a Monday and Jake is feeling

12
00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:38,489
extra worn out because he had to deal

13
00:00:38,489 --> 00:00:39,600
with some family problems over the

14
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,090
weekend he would really like a day off

15
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:44,070
but he doesn't have any PTO when he

16
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:45,450
knows that the rest of his team is hard

17
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:47,579
at work so he decides to tough it out

18
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:50,550
and head into the office the first thing

19
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,020
he does when he gets there is check on

20
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:53,309
that poll work less you up and on Friday

21
00:00:53,309 --> 00:00:56,340
he sees he got a review and wants to

22
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:58,590
check the comments on it but it turns

23
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:00,000
out there was only one comment and it

24
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,320
was left by a senior engineer on his

25
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:04,769
team and it says this won't work that's

26
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:08,820
it nothing else so then since he started

27
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:09,990
out pretty tired Jake's already

28
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:11,460
beginning to feel some frustration he's

29
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:13,890
thinking to himself well why won't this

30
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:16,080
work it is what was asked in I worked

31
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:20,280
hard on it but he moves on he has a

32
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,110
meeting coming up it's his first meeting

33
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:23,400
of the day and it's a one-on-one with

34
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,830
his manager he gets to the meeting a bit

35
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:27,299
early hoping that he'd be able to have

36
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:29,310
some time to talk about his frustrations

37
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:30,570
and some problems going on with the

38
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:33,060
project but as soon as his manager gets

39
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:35,790
to the door he asks Sam have you

40
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:38,070
finished feature X this feature was

41
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:39,270
supposed to be delivered last week but

42
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:41,729
due to issues with other teams he was

43
00:01:41,729 --> 00:01:44,130
then able to finish it on time and so

44
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:45,270
they spend their whole time discussing

45
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:45,950
that

46
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:48,060
so when Jake leaves this meeting he's

47
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:50,430
thinking to himself no it's not finished

48
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:52,110
but that's not what I wanted to talk

49
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:55,979
about so it's about lunchtime now and he

50
00:01:55,979 --> 00:01:59,340
heads to lunch with his teammates since

51
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:00,630
his meeting ran a bit long though by the

52
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:02,520
time he gets to the lunch table they're

53
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,740
already in conversation Jake's hoping

54
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:05,790
that they could talk about something

55
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:07,439
other than tech for a little bit and

56
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:08,970
seeing as it is on Monday he's hoping

57
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:10,080
that maybe they have some weekend

58
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,400
stories that they could share

59
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,420
however they're already in conversation

60
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:15,620
and they're talking about the latest

61
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:17,510
JavaScript framework did you hear about

62
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:20,810
new thing Jas Jade hasn't heard of this

63
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:21,860
because he was dealing with family

64
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:22,970
issues over the weekend and so he's

65
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:24,920
thinking to himself great yet another

66
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:27,800
thing that I need to go learn this feeds

67
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:28,970
into is already negative emotions about

68
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:30,410
the day there's so much going on for him

69
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:34,550
there's too much going on so it's after

70
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:36,680
lunch now and Jake really just wants to

71
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,540
go home so he soaks back to his death

72
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:40,730
desking kind of just fires up his text

73
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:43,370
editor he can't quite get into flow with

74
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:45,590
his work and so he checks his emails and

75
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:48,650
checks Twitter a bunch and kind of just

76
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:50,420
sits there quietly until the clock

77
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:53,300
finally hits 5:00 and he feels okay I've

78
00:02:53,300 --> 00:03:00,020
put in a full day I can go home so how

79
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:01,520
many of you have ever had a day of like

80
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,800
Jake chips did a day where you feel

81
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:06,500
tired and worn out and like no one's

82
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,030
really supporting you and the

83
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:10,670
frustrations are having that work I know

84
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:14,570
I have Jake's story here is similar to

85
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:16,490
parts of my own story and I imagine

86
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:17,900
they're similar to many stories that

87
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:21,380
could be shared in this audience my name

88
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:23,030
is Trent Willis and I'm a senior UI

89
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:25,370
engineer at Netflix apparently and today

90
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:28,130
I want to talk about a skill that I

91
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:29,660
believe is really really important for

92
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:32,510
our industry but often crew crucially

93
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:35,990
undervalued that is the ability to care

94
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:38,450
for your fellow developers you see the

95
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:40,640
tragic thing about the story with Jake

96
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,530
is that this one disappointing and

97
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:43,880
discouraging day can easily turn into

98
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:46,850
weeks or months of feeling worn out at

99
00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:50,090
work this means lost productivity lower

100
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:52,160
team morale and potentially if things

101
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,780
are bad enough the loss of a talented

102
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:56,959
employee so how can things have gone

103
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:58,820
differently how could the interactions

104
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:00,200
that have occurred between Jake and his

105
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,150
co-workers have been made better without

106
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:03,410
them knowing what was going through

107
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:05,060
Jake's mine aren't necessarily going on

108
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:07,760
in Jake's personal life that's what

109
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,170
we're gonna explore for the remainder of

110
00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:13,040
this talk so to start I want us to focus

111
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:16,100
on this first word caring in context

112
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:18,350
it's an action it's not a state of being

113
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:20,560
but something which you perform

114
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,960
in speaking with other developers and

115
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,970
managers I've often found that we talk

116
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:27,280
about caring or empathy and high-level

117
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:30,730
or abstract terms we don't really speak

118
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:32,290
frequently about the actions which we

119
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:34,720
think represent someone caring and even

120
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,100
less do we talk about how there's

121
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:37,360
applied to people that aren't in

122
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,660
leadership positions the good news here

123
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:42,550
though is that since caring is an action

124
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:43,720
it means that there are some specific

125
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,970
acts and thought processes we can employ

126
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:49,060
to be more caring and since there are

127
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:50,500
actions that means we can practice them

128
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,180
and if we can practice them that means

129
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:54,100
we can get better at them and it also

130
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:55,930
means that we can work at them together

131
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:59,800
and work with each other to improve so

132
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,880
now's a good time for me to mention that

133
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,910
I'm not a caring person by nature I am

134
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:06,160
an introvert in that I get drained from

135
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,110
interacting with other people so being

136
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:09,490
supportive especially in emotionally

137
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:11,490
hard times is really difficult

138
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:13,150
additionally I can have a hard time

139
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:15,820
relating to others at points and often

140
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:18,310
like to keep to myself I'm sure at least

141
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:20,490
some of you know what this is like

142
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:23,350
however I've been tremendously lucky to

143
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:25,270
have wonderful people in my life

144
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:27,250
especially in the workplace that have

145
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:28,600
called me out on how I interact with

146
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:31,450
co-workers and encourage me to be better

147
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:34,180
at it to strive to be better so now I

148
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:35,169
look at it this way

149
00:05:35,169 --> 00:05:43,330
I respect my limitations but I don't use

150
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:45,700
them as an excuse and what I mean by

151
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:47,530
this is I know that I'm gonna have to

152
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:49,450
put in a little extra bit of effort in

153
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:51,250
order to be more caring and supportive

154
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:52,660
of my teammates but that's no reason for

155
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:55,419
me not to do it we're all humans first

156
00:05:55,419 --> 00:05:57,640
in developers second and I definitely

157
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,770
put in lots of effort and energy towards

158
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:01,900
being a better developer so it's only

159
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:03,039
reasonable that I can put in at least

160
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:04,210
some effort towards being a better

161
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:07,840
person and a more caring teammate so

162
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,460
with that in mind let's look at some

163
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:11,620
practical ways that we can get better at

164
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:13,500
caring together

165
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:18,240
so first up code reviews whether it's

166
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,280
product reviews code reviews or design

167
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,729
reviews the process of soliciting

168
00:06:24,729 --> 00:06:26,710
feedback about decisions and then

169
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:27,820
incorporating that feedback is a

170
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:29,560
relatively regular part of most

171
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:33,159
developers work now there's a lot that

172
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:33,990
we can say

173
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:39,090
about how to make code reviews more more

174
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:40,830
caring how we can be more caring in

175
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:44,190
those actions invited he covered a lot

176
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:46,110
of that in our talk earlier but I really

177
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:48,360
just want to focus on one area that is

178
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:51,360
the emotional and interpersonal aspects

179
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,750
of these review processes in a written

180
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:56,430
version of her talk she groups these

181
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:58,830
under a header called the harder things

182
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:01,560
but the most important which leaves us

183
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,520
with the question why are these the

184
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:03,960
harder things and why are they the most

185
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:06,360
important things it's because they're

186
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,910
almost entirely of all about people or

187
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:10,200
more specifically they're about people

188
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:14,220
and communication and so whether it's

189
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:16,590
communication in the form of feedback or

190
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:18,720
critiques or even just a discussion

191
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,540
about the way something was done

192
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:22,710
communication between a reviewer and

193
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:24,150
overview II is really the Avenue by

194
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:26,030
which these reviews derive their value

195
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:29,100
if I leave a comment that's just LG TM

196
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:30,750
looks good to me that doesn't really

197
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,520
tell you a whole lot right like what's

198
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:34,200
good about it or did you even really

199
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,610
look at it like if you don't have

200
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:38,100
anything specific to say how do I know

201
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:43,250
that you actually looked at it and so

202
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:46,350
with this in mind how can we incorporate

203
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:49,610
more care into our communication process

204
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:51,630
well there's a lot of things we can do

205
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:53,220
and I don't plan to try to solve the

206
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:55,110
entire gamut of interpersonal

207
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:57,150
communication problems in a 20 minute

208
00:07:57,150 --> 00:08:00,360
talk but I want to focus on one specific

209
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:04,710
area and that is your tone so whether

210
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:06,720
it's a review or an email or any form of

211
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,280
written communication we really need to

212
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,370
make sure that we're not being tone deaf

213
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:12,750
what I mean by this is be cognizant of

214
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:14,520
the tone that you're using when you're

215
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:17,850
communicating we've all or most of us

216
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:18,990
have likely at one point or another

217
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:21,090
interacted with someone that is it a

218
00:08:21,090 --> 00:08:23,820
condescending detached or just negative

219
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:25,230
in the way that they communicate and

220
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:27,450
just as those tones can be really

221
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:30,960
draining and reviews in written

222
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,160
communication they're also draining a

223
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:35,280
normal conversation so we need to be

224
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,990
conscious that we're not letting the

225
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:37,980
fact that we're sitting behind a

226
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:40,440
computer translate into the way that

227
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,000
we're communicating to our co-workers

228
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,220
through that computer which can often

229
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:47,800
happen but to illustrate why I

230
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:50,380
tone is such an important part of our

231
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:53,860
jobs I want to share a brief story so a

232
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:55,600
little while ago I was working on a

233
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,339
project and it was supported by a really

234
00:08:57,339 --> 00:08:59,470
skilled infrastructure team the

235
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:01,120
developers on the main project would

236
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,860
defer to this infrastructure or support

237
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:04,839
team frequently because they had a lot

238
00:09:04,839 --> 00:09:08,800
of experience and expertise however some

239
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,570
members of this m4 team could come

240
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:12,130
across as a bit condescending or aloof

241
00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:14,399
especially when reviewing the code of

242
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:18,250
developers that Warnock's experienced so

243
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:20,019
what resulted is that the developers

244
00:09:20,019 --> 00:09:21,519
working on this project began to avoid

245
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,709
the zimpher team and this led to

246
00:09:23,709 --> 00:09:25,420
problems in the project problems that

247
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:27,220
probably could have been avoided had

248
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:29,170
they had the insight of these more

249
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:32,800
experienced developers and so the

250
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,350
outcome here was that the project was

251
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:37,420
negatively and directly impacted by the

252
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:39,970
communication style of just a couple

253
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:41,440
members of this team it wasn't even the

254
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,899
whole team just some of them and this

255
00:09:43,899 --> 00:09:45,579
impacted not only the project but also

256
00:09:45,579 --> 00:09:47,860
relationships and the team's morale in

257
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:50,980
the long run so what can you do to make

258
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:52,649
sure that things like this don't happen

259
00:09:52,649 --> 00:09:54,850
well to start if you've never really put

260
00:09:54,850 --> 00:09:56,920
thought into how you communicate in the

261
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,750
tone that you're conveying ask your

262
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:01,720
co-workers it can either be about review

263
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:04,149
specifically or more generally about how

264
00:10:04,149 --> 00:10:05,860
you communicate I can almost guarantee

265
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:07,600
you that they would have something to

266
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:12,730
say to you beyond that ask them what

267
00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:16,500
they think that you can do to improve in

268
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,700
doing this you're opening up a dialogue

269
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:21,579
for you guys to figure out how to work

270
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:24,670
better and more effectively together but

271
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:26,230
it's also important to realize that this

272
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:27,640
isn't going to be something that you do

273
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:30,880
once and you're done with it different

274
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,620
teams and different individuals within a

275
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:33,820
team are all going to have different

276
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:35,740
communication styles and you need to

277
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:37,720
work together to find ways to improve

278
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:40,390
that communication this will let you

279
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:42,520
collaborate more effectively grow closer

280
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:45,540
as a team and avoid frustration and

281
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:49,420
misunderstanding so beyond soliciting

282
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:50,709
this feedback though I also have a set

283
00:10:50,709 --> 00:10:52,540
of guidelines that I keep to help me

284
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:54,010
keep my tone in check while I'm

285
00:10:54,010 --> 00:10:57,490
communicating those are ask questions

286
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:00,399
often explain frequently and never

287
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:01,330
decree

288
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:03,640
so by asking questions we're

289
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:04,899
acknowledging the rationality and

290
00:11:04,899 --> 00:11:06,880
intelligence of the other person at the

291
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:10,720
end of the review by explaining we share

292
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,790
context and provide opportunities for

293
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:16,019
others joining the conversation to learn

294
00:11:16,019 --> 00:11:18,459
and then might not de cream we avoid

295
00:11:18,459 --> 00:11:20,110
coming across as condescending and out

296
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:21,670
of touch with the experiences of other

297
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:23,829
developers which is often what it feels

298
00:11:23,829 --> 00:11:27,010
like so if we apply these guidelines how

299
00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:29,050
might the review comment from the

300
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:32,320
beginning of Jake's day have looked well

301
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,240
instead of saying this won't work and

302
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,800
leaving it at that its coworker may have

303
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,660
instead chosen to say why did you

304
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:39,610
approach it this way I'm not sure this

305
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:41,620
will work because and then engine insert

306
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:44,440
is rationale so this approach to several

307
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:46,390
things first it acknowledges that Jake's

308
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:48,880
a rational and logical and intelligent

309
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,399
person he likely had reasons for why he

310
00:11:51,399 --> 00:11:52,779
chose to approach the problem the way

311
00:11:52,779 --> 00:11:56,170
that he did second it gives an

312
00:11:56,170 --> 00:11:57,820
opportunity for the reviewer to share

313
00:11:57,820 --> 00:11:59,920
context that Jake might be missing as to

314
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,740
why this won't work or on the other hand

315
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:04,690
it will allow Jake to see where the

316
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:06,339
reviewer is missing context that Jake

317
00:12:06,339 --> 00:12:10,270
had while implementing the future and

318
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:13,360
then finally it shows that there was

319
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,730
time and care put into reviewing Jake's

320
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:18,790
hard work and not just being a drive by

321
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:22,870
where he left a flippant comment and so

322
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:24,550
the only real drawback here is that I

323
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:25,660
will have taken the review or slightly

324
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:27,760
more time to construct his review

325
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,529
comment but really putting in that a

326
00:12:29,529 --> 00:12:31,959
little bit of time is the bare necessity

327
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:33,160
that we should be asking of someone

328
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:35,050
reviewing code that is going to be going

329
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:39,490
to production now there's a whole lot

330
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:41,550
more I could say about communication and

331
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:44,829
code reviews or reviews in general but

332
00:12:44,829 --> 00:12:47,170
I'll end this section with one more tip

333
00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:50,410
about improving their tone and that is

334
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:53,020
make opportunities for praise what I

335
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:55,540
mean by this is there are chances for

336
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:57,790
you to encourage and support and be

337
00:12:57,790 --> 00:12:59,350
positive even when you have to provide

338
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:01,029
fatigues or potentially disagree with

339
00:13:01,029 --> 00:13:04,240
someone if nothing else simply drop in a

340
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,399
comment like great job or thanks for all

341
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:08,529
the hard work on this just do that from

342
00:13:08,529 --> 00:13:11,440
time to time a little bit of positivity

343
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,209
can go a long way

344
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:14,370
constant barrage

345
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:16,950
of technical comments in critiques and

346
00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:18,870
feedback can be really draining to

347
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:21,000
everyone involved but sending some

348
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,430
positivity can really help restore that

349
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:24,990
energy for someone that's having to be

350
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:27,930
reviewed this goes doubly so if you're a

351
00:13:27,930 --> 00:13:30,029
senior or a lead engineer because that

352
00:13:30,029 --> 00:13:31,470
means there is probably someone looking

353
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:34,320
up to you and as such you should be

354
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,089
setting an example for how to be

355
00:13:36,089 --> 00:13:38,270
supportive of your teammates

356
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:41,640
so moving on Jake had a slightly less

357
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:43,560
than stellar encounter in a one-on-one

358
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:45,960
meeting with his manager now this

359
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,400
meeting didn't necessarily need to be

360
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,200
with his manager could have been with a

361
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:52,620
co-worker up here a mentor or anyone

362
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:54,150
really but the fact that it was his

363
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:55,740
manager carried extra weight for Jake

364
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:59,130
but we also have to remember that Jake's

365
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:00,810
manager probably wasn't trying to be

366
00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:01,620
malicious here

367
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:04,290
he just wanted a status update and given

368
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:05,670
the circumstances he was likely under a

369
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:08,820
lot of pressure to deliver as well so if

370
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:10,860
we step into the shoes of Jake's manager

371
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:13,200
here how can we make sure that we're

372
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,120
being supportive while meeting with

373
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:19,589
someone else well the first thing that

374
00:14:19,589 --> 00:14:22,170
we should do is try to be flexible with

375
00:14:22,170 --> 00:14:24,720
our time in one-on-one meetings that

376
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,760
means that this is someone that you meet

377
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,380
with relatively regularly or are going

378
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:31,080
to be meeting regularly it's important

379
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,070
to acknowledge that you're meeting with

380
00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:33,839
someone else and so while you may be

381
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:36,140
coming to this meeting with a bunch of

382
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:38,490
objectives and ideas about what you want

383
00:14:38,490 --> 00:14:40,440
to get out of it the person you're

384
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,550
meeting with is also coming with

385
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:43,110
expectations about what they want to get

386
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:49,230
out of it and so as a leader or as

387
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:51,270
someone that's leading a one-on-one then

388
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:52,560
you should practice being flexible with

389
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,600
your time if they have something

390
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,490
important that they want to discuss make

391
00:14:56,490 --> 00:15:00,150
sure that you make some room for it if

392
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:01,500
you have something absolutely critical

393
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:02,910
that needs to be discussed with them

394
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:04,440
though perhaps that should be another

395
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,120
meeting a different meeting from your

396
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:10,290
one-on-one this idea of being flexible

397
00:15:10,290 --> 00:15:12,240
with your time ties into a concept of

398
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:15,810
psychological safety so back in 2012

399
00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:18,630
Google did a study called Project

400
00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:20,910
Aristotle that was aimed at discovering

401
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:22,170
what made certain teams more effective

402
00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:24,750
than others they researched over a

403
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:27,329
hundred teams in over several years and

404
00:15:27,329 --> 00:15:29,489
that psychological safety was a key

405
00:15:29,489 --> 00:15:33,660
indicator of effective teams but what

406
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:34,379
does that mean

407
00:15:34,379 --> 00:15:37,499
what is psychological safety well in the

408
00:15:37,499 --> 00:15:40,230
field of psychology it's a group trait

409
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:42,119
that's marked by behaviors such as

410
00:15:42,119 --> 00:15:43,679
conversational turn-taking

411
00:15:43,679 --> 00:15:47,429
and high average social sensitivity now

412
00:15:47,429 --> 00:15:48,929
if you're like me and not a psychologist

413
00:15:48,929 --> 00:15:50,670
you might be thinking okay that doesn't

414
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:53,339
make anything any more clear so put more

415
00:15:53,339 --> 00:15:56,249
plainly it's a sense that your group or

416
00:15:56,249 --> 00:15:59,220
your team will not embarrass reject or

417
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:02,970
punish you for speaking up so how does

418
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:08,699
this tie into one-on-ones well as a as

419
00:16:08,699 --> 00:16:10,049
someone that's hosting on one-on-one it

420
00:16:10,049 --> 00:16:11,069
means that you have some level of

421
00:16:11,069 --> 00:16:13,470
influence and as someone with influence

422
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:15,749
it's your responsibility to help create

423
00:16:15,749 --> 00:16:18,269
a psychologically safe workplace for

424
00:16:18,269 --> 00:16:21,420
your co-workers and so if you are

425
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:23,910
allowing them to be able to come to you

426
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:25,470
and feel confident that you will listen

427
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:28,259
in your one-on-one meetings by being

428
00:16:28,259 --> 00:16:30,720
flexible with your time then it will go

429
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,459
a long way toward setting an example for

430
00:16:32,459 --> 00:16:33,959
them to feel comfortable speaking up in

431
00:16:33,959 --> 00:16:36,299
all circumstances because they know that

432
00:16:36,299 --> 00:16:38,879
they value your voice and that they

433
00:16:38,879 --> 00:16:42,899
value your ability to have opinions and

434
00:16:42,899 --> 00:16:46,709
thoughts so beyond ensuring that your

435
00:16:46,709 --> 00:16:47,939
team feels comfortable speaking up

436
00:16:47,939 --> 00:16:50,489
though you also need to make sure that

437
00:16:50,489 --> 00:16:51,509
you're hearing what they aren't

438
00:16:51,509 --> 00:16:54,449
explicitly telling you so there's a

439
00:16:54,449 --> 00:16:55,939
quote by management guru Peter F Drucker

440
00:16:55,939 --> 00:16:57,989
that says the most important thing in

441
00:16:57,989 --> 00:17:00,110
communication is hearing what isn't said

442
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:02,610
now this quote is often used to talk

443
00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:04,679
about nonverbal communication but I

444
00:17:04,679 --> 00:17:06,149
believe that it's also applicable to

445
00:17:06,149 --> 00:17:09,839
verbal communication you see if

446
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:11,220
someone's if you hear a bunch of

447
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:12,240
developers complaining about a problem

448
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,339
but they're not explicitly asking for it

449
00:17:14,339 --> 00:17:16,260
to be resolved you can still guess that

450
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:17,189
there's something that needs to be done

451
00:17:17,189 --> 00:17:19,199
there or maybe it's not that obvious

452
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:21,179
maybe you see a co-worker who's every

453
00:17:21,179 --> 00:17:23,039
time you talk to him is sounds really

454
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:25,079
frustrated but you don't know why but

455
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:26,220
you do know that he's been staying late

456
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:30,090
at work a lot recently in both of these

457
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:33,149
cases you can identify ways to help or

458
00:17:33,149 --> 00:17:35,940
to care for your teammates and the first

459
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:37,590
scenario where you're hearing developers

460
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:40,960
complain escalate the problem

461
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,970
someone that can go fix it for them or

462
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:44,169
if you're not sure how big of an issue

463
00:17:44,169 --> 00:17:46,179
it is go talk to the developers and be

464
00:17:46,179 --> 00:17:47,950
pointed about figuring out if this is a

465
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:51,279
true problem for them and the latter

466
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:53,200
scenario where your co-workers being

467
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:56,860
frustrated go talk to him see if you can

468
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:58,929
take on some of the work or if you don't

469
00:17:58,929 --> 00:18:00,370
have the bandwidth to do that go find

470
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:02,289
his manager and ask him hey can we get

471
00:18:02,289 --> 00:18:03,789
more developers to help this guy out so

472
00:18:03,789 --> 00:18:06,279
he doesn't have to stay late or hey can

473
00:18:06,279 --> 00:18:08,830
we get more or we can we change the

474
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:10,299
expectations on when these things need

475
00:18:10,299 --> 00:18:11,679
to be delivered so that way he doesn't

476
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:14,529
feel all this pressure the point is is

477
00:18:14,529 --> 00:18:17,380
that if you stop and look there are

478
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:19,179
likely things going on in your team that

479
00:18:19,179 --> 00:18:21,700
could be made better if someone took the

480
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:27,370
time to notice them so let's consider

481
00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:30,100
Jake's earlier meeting instead of asking

482
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:32,289
about feature acts right away what if

483
00:18:32,289 --> 00:18:33,700
his manager had started their meeting by

484
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:36,220
asking by saying I have something I'd

485
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:38,500
like to talk about but first is there

486
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:39,730
anything that you would like to talk

487
00:18:39,730 --> 00:18:43,330
about this way Jake knows that there's

488
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:44,919
an opportunity there for him to talk

489
00:18:44,919 --> 00:18:46,779
about his frustrations especially if

490
00:18:46,779 --> 00:18:47,770
there's something that's really weighing

491
00:18:47,770 --> 00:18:50,590
on him it's important that his manager

492
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:51,970
doesn't say something like I have

493
00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:53,500
something very important that I want to

494
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,299
talk about because if he does that then

495
00:18:55,299 --> 00:18:57,970
Jake may be like well am i my problems

496
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,620
really that important maybe they can

497
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:02,500
wait on the flip side of this coin

498
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:04,240
though Jake needs to recognize that

499
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,590
there is something his manager wants to

500
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:08,679
talk about and so if they use up all

501
00:19:08,679 --> 00:19:10,120
their time in the meeting talking about

502
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:11,770
Jake's frustrations then they should

503
00:19:11,770 --> 00:19:13,149
schedule another meeting

504
00:19:13,149 --> 00:19:15,850
Jake should offer this carrying goes

505
00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:17,799
both ways and it's up to both parties to

506
00:19:17,799 --> 00:19:21,789
recognize this now he might question at

507
00:19:21,789 --> 00:19:22,919
this point if this always makes sense

508
00:19:22,919 --> 00:19:25,720
right what if the manager has a really

509
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:27,429
critical business topic that's blocking

510
00:19:27,429 --> 00:19:30,010
another team or what if Jake's

511
00:19:30,010 --> 00:19:32,799
frustrations can't be resolved well

512
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:34,659
you'll need to use your best judgment I

513
00:19:34,659 --> 00:19:35,890
mean as with most things in software

514
00:19:35,890 --> 00:19:37,720
engineering there's no one solution to

515
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:41,590
everything but be careful because small

516
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:43,480
problems and small frustrations have a

517
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:45,100
habit of snowballing and turning into

518
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:50,049
much larger issues now there's plenty

519
00:19:50,049 --> 00:19:51,970
more that I could talk about in terms of

520
00:19:51,970 --> 00:19:53,139
meetings in building effective

521
00:19:53,139 --> 00:19:54,400
one-on-one meetings

522
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,960
but I want to end this section with one

523
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:59,410
more tip let us go for a walk if you've

524
00:19:59,410 --> 00:20:00,910
never done it before try taking a walk

525
00:20:00,910 --> 00:20:04,090
during our one-on-ones anecdotally

526
00:20:04,090 --> 00:20:05,170
speaking they can feel a lot more

527
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:07,360
relaxed and laid-back than sitting in a

528
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,180
cold conference room across from someone

529
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:11,020
and especially if you have something

530
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:12,820
difficult to discuss it can be a lot

531
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:14,380
easier to do that while you're looking

532
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:16,570
at your feet or looking at the beautiful

533
00:20:16,570 --> 00:20:19,330
scenery around you instead of sitting in

534
00:20:19,330 --> 00:20:20,590
a cold conference room staring into

535
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:25,930
someone's eyes that said make sure that

536
00:20:25,930 --> 00:20:27,040
you take into account the person you're

537
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,180
meeting with this won't work for

538
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:30,250
everyone and so you should communicate

539
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:31,930
with each other to find a structure that

540
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:36,450
is effective and useful for both of you

541
00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:38,940
so we've now talked about two specific

542
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:43,990
work-related tasks that come up but what

543
00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:45,460
about other day-to-day activities if

544
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:46,660
you're a developer chances are you don't

545
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:48,280
spend your whole day in meetings or

546
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:50,500
doing code reviews well at least I

547
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,810
should hope not so how do you care for

548
00:20:52,810 --> 00:20:54,220
your teammates if you're just getting

549
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:57,010
lunch or chatting about tech or simply

550
00:20:57,010 --> 00:20:59,610
doing a lull in the day at your desks

551
00:20:59,610 --> 00:21:02,080
well my first tip here is to close the

552
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:05,710
shop as high-performing and really

553
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:07,330
motivated individuals it can be really

554
00:21:07,330 --> 00:21:09,010
easy for us to want to talk about work

555
00:21:09,010 --> 00:21:13,030
or talk shop all the time and especially

556
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:14,590
in the tech industry I've met tons of

557
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:16,240
people especially at conferences like

558
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,130
this that love what they do and love

559
00:21:18,130 --> 00:21:20,230
their jobs and that is fantastic I'm

560
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:23,320
super happy about that but if that's all

561
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:25,960
that I ever know about people then I'm

562
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,610
missing out on critical opportunities to

563
00:21:27,610 --> 00:21:29,680
build memories and stronger bonds and

564
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:31,200
connections with my teammates

565
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,370
that means we're missing out on chances

566
00:21:33,370 --> 00:21:35,350
to build more collaborative teams that

567
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:37,060
can work more effectively together and

568
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:39,070
therefore deliver better products in the

569
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:42,040
end so we should inquire about family

570
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:44,470
and friends ask about their hobbies talk

571
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:45,970
about local events or maybe even ask

572
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:47,250
them about their favorite Netflix series

573
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:49,690
the possibilities really are almost

574
00:21:49,690 --> 00:21:55,300
endless so if we think about Jake's

575
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:58,240
earlier lunch conversation what if

576
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,710
instead of say talking about new thing

577
00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:01,750
JSL lunches co-workers opened up by

578
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:03,160
talking about know what everyone had

579
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:05,950
done over the weekend maybe jake would

580
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:07,300
have a chance to open up about how he's

581
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:08,380
feeling with the project

582
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:10,360
if his co-workers are feeling the same

583
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:13,450
way they can commiserate about it or if

584
00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:14,950
he feels that's too personal he can

585
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:16,660
always sit back and hear about what's

586
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:18,309
going on in the lives of his co-workers

587
00:22:18,309 --> 00:22:20,410
and find a way to connect with him that

588
00:22:20,410 --> 00:22:23,830
way now this isn't to say that you

589
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:26,320
should never talk about work especially

590
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:30,630
if you enjoy work outside of the office

591
00:22:30,630 --> 00:22:33,880
but it is to say that try to put naam

592
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:35,169
work things at the forefront every now

593
00:22:35,169 --> 00:22:37,870
and then so I guess more accurately

594
00:22:37,870 --> 00:22:39,280
instead of closing the shop close the

595
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,470
shop occasionally don't shut it down

596
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:44,500
permanently and I think you'll be

597
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,480
surprised by how easy it is to find

598
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:47,860
other things to talk about once you

599
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:49,059
begin to understand your co-workers

600
00:22:49,059 --> 00:22:52,240
apart from their role at the office and

601
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,190
those close this goes a long way towards

602
00:22:54,190 --> 00:22:55,900
helping build a psychologically safe

603
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:57,490
workplace because it's letting your

604
00:22:57,490 --> 00:22:59,679
co-workers know that hey you have value

605
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:01,150
to me outside of the function that

606
00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:02,559
you're fulfilling it while you're in the

607
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:08,140
office so at this point it could feel

608
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:10,059
like I'm prescribing a bunch of steps or

609
00:23:10,059 --> 00:23:11,890
a bunch of things that you have to do

610
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:13,750
checkboxes to check in order to build a

611
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:15,490
caring and effective team but that's not

612
00:23:15,490 --> 00:23:17,890
really the goal my goal in this talk is

613
00:23:17,890 --> 00:23:20,710
to provide examples examples of how we

614
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:23,049
translate this amorphous concept of

615
00:23:23,049 --> 00:23:26,049
caring or being empathetic and turn them

616
00:23:26,049 --> 00:23:27,490
into concrete actions that we can think

617
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:29,110
about in practice or start incorporating

618
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:33,669
into the work life so I think author Bob

619
00:23:33,669 --> 00:23:36,220
goft expressed the idea that for me lies

620
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:38,020
behind all of this really succinctly in

621
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:41,530
a book that he has called love does and

622
00:23:41,530 --> 00:23:43,600
he says you don't need a plan you just

623
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:46,780
need to be present what does it mean to

624
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:49,600
be present in this context though well

625
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,159
it's not really so much about a specific

626
00:23:51,159 --> 00:23:55,230
moment or a location in time it's about

627
00:23:55,230 --> 00:23:58,059
the environment in the workplace setting

628
00:23:58,059 --> 00:23:59,650
that you find yourself in your teammates

629
00:23:59,650 --> 00:24:03,070
in there's this intersection of yourself

630
00:24:03,070 --> 00:24:05,020
and the unique personalities of your

631
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:07,409
teammates and your work circumstances

632
00:24:07,409 --> 00:24:09,700
that is really the present moment for

633
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:12,429
you so being present allows you to see

634
00:24:12,429 --> 00:24:14,020
how the review comment you're about to

635
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:15,520
leave might be interpreted negatively by

636
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:19,360
your teammate or it will allow you to

637
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:20,500
see that the person you're meeting with

638
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:21,820
is looking worn out and

639
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:27,159
needs a break and it also lets you

640
00:24:27,159 --> 00:24:28,419
recognize when your team is ready to

641
00:24:28,419 --> 00:24:31,899
celebrate a victory and this that last

642
00:24:31,899 --> 00:24:33,429
item is really important because it

643
00:24:33,429 --> 00:24:34,600
would be really easy to get the idea

644
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,580
from this talk that caring only matters

645
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:38,710
when bad stuff is happening analysis but

646
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:42,279
that's not true accomplishments

647
00:24:42,279 --> 00:24:44,950
victories celebrations they all need to

648
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:47,590
be shared because otherwise if you're

649
00:24:47,590 --> 00:24:48,970
only around when bad stuff is happening

650
00:24:48,970 --> 00:24:50,350
to your coworkers are there looking

651
00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:51,759
stressed out and you're basically just a

652
00:24:51,759 --> 00:24:55,259
bad omen and that's not a good team pain

653
00:24:55,259 --> 00:24:57,489
so remember how Jake just kind of soaked

654
00:24:57,489 --> 00:25:01,210
back to his desk after lunch we've all

655
00:25:01,210 --> 00:25:02,769
likely seen co-workers in the similar

656
00:25:02,769 --> 00:25:05,679
situation whether it's increased sighing

657
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:07,779
or longer stares off into space or maybe

658
00:25:07,779 --> 00:25:10,809
more cursing or abnormal quietness

659
00:25:10,809 --> 00:25:12,669
they're usually signs when people are

660
00:25:12,669 --> 00:25:14,349
feeling off or feeling down about what's

661
00:25:14,349 --> 00:25:18,129
going on in their job being present and

662
00:25:18,129 --> 00:25:19,989
actively giving them some attention from

663
00:25:19,989 --> 00:25:21,729
time to time allows us to recognize when

664
00:25:21,729 --> 00:25:25,200
people look off that's really important

665
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,369
now when we recognize people look off

666
00:25:27,369 --> 00:25:28,899
though it's really easy for us to think

667
00:25:28,899 --> 00:25:31,090
oh I'm just gonna pretend that doesn't

668
00:25:31,090 --> 00:25:33,399
exist and ignore it because it's

669
00:25:33,399 --> 00:25:35,169
comfortable like we don't want to get

670
00:25:35,169 --> 00:25:38,289
involved in other people's mess however

671
00:25:38,289 --> 00:25:40,659
I would encourage you to take a deep

672
00:25:40,659 --> 00:25:43,509
breath and then lean in and simply ask

673
00:25:43,509 --> 00:25:46,029
him hey are you doing okay is there

674
00:25:46,029 --> 00:25:48,429
anything you want to talk about or maybe

675
00:25:48,429 --> 00:25:50,289
make it a bit more personal I don't know

676
00:25:50,289 --> 00:25:51,820
hey you've been a bit more quiet than

677
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:56,349
usual hey is everything okay sometimes

678
00:25:56,349 --> 00:25:57,489
that's all it takes to turn someone's

679
00:25:57,489 --> 00:26:00,429
day or entire we compound just knowing

680
00:26:00,429 --> 00:26:02,590
that someone wants to listen they may

681
00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:04,470
not necessarily open up so don't push it

682
00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:07,840
they don't have to tell you anything but

683
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:09,129
let them know that you're there and that

684
00:26:09,129 --> 00:26:12,789
you care and you're available so as a

685
00:26:12,789 --> 00:26:14,979
brief example of this one of the closest

686
00:26:14,979 --> 00:26:17,470
co-workers I ever had loved Martinelli's

687
00:26:17,470 --> 00:26:20,649
apple juice as do I but they didn't

688
00:26:20,649 --> 00:26:23,470
stock it in the building that we worked

689
00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:25,330
in I know this is a Silicon Valley

690
00:26:25,330 --> 00:26:28,359
problem but they stopped it in a

691
00:26:28,359 --> 00:26:31,029
building across our campus and so we

692
00:26:31,029 --> 00:26:32,529
would often go for some walks to get

693
00:26:32,529 --> 00:26:35,440
some apple juice on this walk which only

694
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,090
a couple of minutes was a chance for us

695
00:26:37,090 --> 00:26:38,980
to talk openly about whatever we wanted

696
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:40,299
without fear of other people being

697
00:26:40,299 --> 00:26:43,629
around we could vent if we were really

698
00:26:43,629 --> 00:26:46,059
frustrated about something or we could

699
00:26:46,059 --> 00:26:48,899
talk enthusiastically about something

700
00:26:48,899 --> 00:26:51,279
the point is that there was always an

701
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:55,899
open invitation there to talk but there

702
00:26:55,899 --> 00:26:57,759
was never an expectation and that

703
00:26:57,759 --> 00:26:59,769
difference between expectation and

704
00:26:59,769 --> 00:27:02,289
invitation is really important because

705
00:27:02,289 --> 00:27:03,940
there is a sense that hey I have someone

706
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:06,429
I can go to if I need but I can also

707
00:27:06,429 --> 00:27:08,740
keep to myself if I want it has an

708
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:09,730
introvert that's really important

709
00:27:09,730 --> 00:27:14,980
because I think my privacy so all of

710
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:16,710
this leads me to my final word of advice

711
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:20,049
that is be available and be open when I

712
00:27:20,049 --> 00:27:22,450
asked a group of managers and developers

713
00:27:22,450 --> 00:27:24,279
what they thought a developer should do

714
00:27:24,279 --> 00:27:25,629
to be a more caring and more empathetic

715
00:27:25,629 --> 00:27:27,639
teammate almost half of them said

716
00:27:27,639 --> 00:27:28,960
something along the lines of be

717
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,940
available for your teammates and be open

718
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:33,580
when you respond to them the reasoning

719
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:35,350
here is that being available makes you

720
00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:36,970
really approachable and can help you

721
00:27:36,970 --> 00:27:38,409
build relationships with your teammates

722
00:27:38,409 --> 00:27:41,169
if you're never around or never at your

723
00:27:41,169 --> 00:27:42,759
desk and people don't know how to get

724
00:27:42,759 --> 00:27:44,350
ahold of you then it may come across as

725
00:27:44,350 --> 00:27:46,539
if you're too busy you're too important

726
00:27:46,539 --> 00:27:48,519
for your teammates that you don't really

727
00:27:48,519 --> 00:27:49,899
care about them their needs aren't as

728
00:27:49,899 --> 00:27:54,220
important to you so make some time try

729
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:56,830
to be around and try to be available but

730
00:27:56,830 --> 00:27:58,629
if you have to be at a lot of meetings

731
00:27:58,629 --> 00:28:00,429
as I know some managers and lead EV do

732
00:28:00,429 --> 00:28:02,350
then just let them know that you would

733
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:03,759
prioritize requests from them to mean

734
00:28:03,759 --> 00:28:06,190
let them know that your priority even if

735
00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:08,019
you can't physically be near them

736
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:11,860
frequently and then when you do respond

737
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:13,240
in these circumstances it's really

738
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:14,590
important that you're open with the

739
00:28:14,590 --> 00:28:17,379
information you're giving most

740
00:28:17,379 --> 00:28:20,320
developers are astute people and they

741
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,149
can tell if someone is holding back

742
00:28:22,149 --> 00:28:24,789
information or just giving them just

743
00:28:24,789 --> 00:28:26,289
enough so that way you leave them alone

744
00:28:26,289 --> 00:28:29,159
and that breeds a lot of distrust right

745
00:28:29,159 --> 00:28:31,330
because it's telling them hey I don't

746
00:28:31,330 --> 00:28:32,799
have confidence in you to give you the

747
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:34,750
whole story or I don't have time to be

748
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:36,480
bothered giving you the whole story

749
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:39,610
so be open try to give until they seem

750
00:28:39,610 --> 00:28:41,679
satisfied with your response and not

751
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:43,419
necessarily when you think that they

752
00:28:43,419 --> 00:28:45,149
should be satisfied with your response I

753
00:28:45,149 --> 00:28:47,110
know for myself this can be really

754
00:28:47,110 --> 00:28:49,270
difficult if I have a big project

755
00:28:49,270 --> 00:28:50,800
I need to finish or have a lot of

756
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:52,240
meetings for whatever reason it could be

757
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,710
really easy for me to just want to brush

758
00:28:53,710 --> 00:28:56,830
people off but I found that taking a

759
00:28:56,830 --> 00:28:58,170
little bit of extra time to like

760
00:28:58,170 --> 00:29:00,280
actually communicate effectively with

761
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:02,050
them goes a long way towards building

762
00:29:02,050 --> 00:29:04,570
better relationships and building them

763
00:29:04,570 --> 00:29:06,760
into better developers because it

764
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:08,500
transfers knowledge to them and lets

765
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:10,060
them know that hey I have confidence in

766
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:14,680
you I trust you to do your job well to

767
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:16,120
this advice though of being available

768
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:17,170
and being open I would also not be

769
00:29:17,170 --> 00:29:20,350
encouraging as with praise in the review

770
00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:21,730
process a little bit of encouragement

771
00:29:21,730 --> 00:29:24,400
can go a long way if a junior dev is

772
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:26,050
coming to you asking questions about how

773
00:29:26,050 --> 00:29:26,890
to implement feature

774
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:28,630
inter conversation by letting them know

775
00:29:28,630 --> 00:29:30,040
that you're excited to see how it turns

776
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:32,350
out or if you have to work on a hard

777
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:34,870
problem with a peer let them know that

778
00:29:34,870 --> 00:29:36,370
you're thankful that they're working on

779
00:29:36,370 --> 00:29:39,250
it with you and investing the time or

780
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:40,510
maybe you find yourself asking a lot of

781
00:29:40,510 --> 00:29:41,890
questions from a lead developer or

782
00:29:41,890 --> 00:29:44,230
senior engineer and let them know hey

783
00:29:44,230 --> 00:29:45,880
thank you for taking the time to help me

784
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:49,240
and it's really benefiting me many of us

785
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:52,000
are expected to do good work and that's

786
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,160
why we have jobs but just because we're

787
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,450
expected to do it doesn't mean it

788
00:29:55,450 --> 00:29:56,860
shouldn't be recognized and encouraged

789
00:29:56,860 --> 00:30:00,040
whenever we see it it really takes a

790
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:01,990
very small amount of energy to say some

791
00:30:01,990 --> 00:30:03,580
positive words to someone but the amount

792
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:05,170
of energy that that imparts to the other

793
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:07,720
person can be really tremendous and

794
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:08,740
could help them be so much more

795
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:12,010
productive so to wrap up I want to

796
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:13,660
mention a quote by the paragon of

797
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:17,020
Silicon Valley Steve Jobs he says he

798
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:18,970
once said great things in business are

799
00:30:18,970 --> 00:30:20,680
never done by one person they're done by

800
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:23,140
a team of people and that last word to

801
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:25,330
me is super critical to the sentiment

802
00:30:25,330 --> 00:30:29,490
expressed here we're not UI engineers or

803
00:30:29,490 --> 00:30:33,940
senior developers or even employees but

804
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:36,040
we are human those titles might be part

805
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:37,300
of how we think about ourselves but

806
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:38,500
they're not really part of our being

807
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:41,490
it's just something that we happen to do

808
00:30:41,490 --> 00:30:43,990
so I urge you all to put forth a little

809
00:30:43,990 --> 00:30:45,490
bit of extra effort every day to care

810
00:30:45,490 --> 00:30:47,380
more for your fellow developers your

811
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:49,750
fellow people and I think you'll be

812
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:51,970
surprised by how much more effective

813
00:30:51,970 --> 00:30:53,800
your team will become and how much

814
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:59,230
better people will grow so maybe instead

815
00:30:59,230 --> 00:31:01,540
of focusing on getting done as we

816
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:02,400
are off to say and

817
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:06,210
industry we focus on growing people my

818
00:31:06,210 --> 00:31:08,490
hope is that this talk has shown that

819
00:31:08,490 --> 00:31:10,230
being more caring or more empathetic

820
00:31:10,230 --> 00:31:11,730
doesn't require you to completely change

821
00:31:11,730 --> 00:31:14,400
your personality also doesn't require a

822
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:17,250
lot of fancy process but it does require

823
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:19,440
you to put yourself in the shoes of your

824
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,450
co-workers and understand what makes

825
00:31:21,450 --> 00:31:23,890
them unique

826
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:26,190
my hope is that this little bit of extra

827
00:31:26,190 --> 00:31:28,050
effort that we put in will help you

828
00:31:28,050 --> 00:31:29,940
experience a team that grows so much

829
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:31,320
more than you ever have before

830
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:34,770
and from that labor from that growing of

831
00:31:34,770 --> 00:31:36,600
other people we can begin to go farther

832
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:39,210
than we ever have before in both in the

833
00:31:39,210 --> 00:31:42,030
workplace and beyond because there is

834
00:31:42,030 --> 00:31:43,380
really so much more to this life than

835
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:46,070
just work thank you
