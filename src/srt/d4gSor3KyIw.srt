[Applause]

2
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:06,240
thank you very much thank you for having

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,230
me here in this beautiful city my talk

4
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:13,049
is called take on me take on me is

5
00:00:13,049 --> 00:00:17,490
actually a 1980s song very catchy song

6
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:19,619
very catchy music with some amazing

7
00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:21,990
animations it's by a Norwegian man

8
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:24,090
called aha

9
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:26,369
the thing is I'm not really good at

10
00:00:26,369 --> 00:00:28,410
music I'm not going to talk about the

11
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:30,090
catchy music but I'm going to talk about

12
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:33,000
the war animations because that's like

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,700
my life go I really enjoy making this

14
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:37,800
kind of completely useless animations

15
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,870
it's like hey I could grab Harry Potter

16
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:42,629
and use CSS gradients and there's

17
00:00:42,629 --> 00:00:44,399
something like that because if he turned

18
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:48,180
white wouldn't you so high or oh yeah

19
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:50,840
I'm ever my friend on developer birthday

20
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:53,489
protector feels less creativity at night

21
00:00:53,489 --> 00:00:56,340
I'm also a Mozilla tech speaker and I

22
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:00,480
also organize CSS conversion Tina so by

23
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,340
the way my name is actually all that but

24
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:04,949
as long as you call me a by Eva or a

25
00:01:04,949 --> 00:01:09,780
face okay well what is this thing this

26
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:11,880
is something called rotoscopy it's an

27
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,650
animation technique that has more than a

28
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:16,770
hundred years old and this animation is

29
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:20,509
no release to make it takes so much time

30
00:01:20,509 --> 00:01:23,009
the thing is that it's really

31
00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:24,810
interesting and even though it has a

32
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:26,939
hundred years old and it began in the

33
00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:29,820
movies and cinema it has eventually

34
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:31,880
gotten into the music video industry

35
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:35,640
especially with this song in 1985 but

36
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:38,430
also in this another one by Green Day in

37
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:44,520
2009 Lily Allen 2015 I mean not Paramore

38
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:48,090
occasionally in two years ago and part

39
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:52,680
Murat all again in 2018 and why not

40
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,750
let's mention that and Justin Bieber

41
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:58,020
this year so how does it work well

42
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:00,390
rotoscoping consists on recording a

43
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:02,969
completely normal video and drawing on

44
00:02:02,969 --> 00:02:06,329
top of that so you have to tell from 15

45
00:02:06,329 --> 00:02:10,289
to 25 images per second that's a lot

46
00:02:10,289 --> 00:02:12,870
and you can be drawing like for five

47
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:15,359
hours when you actually play the video

48
00:02:15,359 --> 00:02:17,129
and you have like three seconds of

49
00:02:17,129 --> 00:02:19,980
animation it's not a much but it will be

50
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:23,790
the best three seconds of your life so

51
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:25,769
you can turn something like these which

52
00:02:25,769 --> 00:02:28,409
looks really what is going on and -

53
00:02:28,409 --> 00:02:29,909
something like this which it looks

54
00:02:29,909 --> 00:02:33,060
amazing so right now you can do

55
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:35,040
rotoscoping with other with photoshop

56
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,909
and welcome but we can actually do it in

57
00:02:38,909 --> 00:02:42,870
the browser so the thing is two years

58
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:44,970
ago this video came out is called hard

59
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:47,849
times by Paramore and when I took a look

60
00:02:47,849 --> 00:02:51,209
at this it was like this light bulb that

61
00:02:51,209 --> 00:02:53,549
turns on and it's like maybe we could

62
00:02:53,549 --> 00:02:55,919
like thing what we can do right now in

63
00:02:55,919 --> 00:02:58,109
web animations and imperator see what

64
00:02:58,109 --> 00:03:02,040
else we can do the thing is I kind of

65
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:04,379
took a look at what we have right now in

66
00:03:04,379 --> 00:03:07,980
the web of traditional animation because

67
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:10,439
once again we keep on bringing things

68
00:03:10,439 --> 00:03:12,810
from tradition and animation from movies

69
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:14,909
and from the cinema into the web and

70
00:03:14,909 --> 00:03:16,709
it's really interesting how far we have

71
00:03:16,709 --> 00:03:20,220
gotten for example we can do today

72
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:23,549
just emotions and motion graphics in the

73
00:03:23,549 --> 00:03:25,919
web if you are into learning a

74
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:28,319
stop-motion you should actually Google

75
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:30,810
Rachel my words because she's an amazing

76
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:32,879
teacher and she has so many videos

77
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,400
online and courses as well teaching how

78
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,530
to make a stop motion animation on the

79
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:40,560
web and when it comes to motion graphics

80
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,819
you can go Chris Connor who is a really

81
00:03:43,819 --> 00:03:47,340
nice person and he does this wonderful

82
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:49,979
useless animations as well like a pig's

83
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:51,840
eye spinner so when you're waiting for

84
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,970
the website too long but it looks like a

85
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:57,150
pizza is great and also I have to

86
00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:00,810
mention Julian must solve our problem

87
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:03,180
miss rennolds is her name and she

88
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:06,239
actually did this great thing which is

89
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:09,150
kind of an and motion graphic animation

90
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:12,840
but in pure CSS so take a look at her

91
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,440
code but if you can because it's amazing

92
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:18,450
so my question is can we go further can

93
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:21,029
we do something else besides this kind

94
00:04:21,029 --> 00:04:22,830
of too traditional image

95
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:25,620
can't be Mabel does skipping on the web

96
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:29,280
well the answer will surprise you know

97
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:34,970
we can and the reason why is because

98
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:37,050
rotoscoping it's something completely

99
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:40,259
handmade it has like the soul of the

100
00:04:40,259 --> 00:04:42,629
people who is drawing and I love my

101
00:04:42,629 --> 00:04:44,669
computer is called Minerva of course he

102
00:04:44,669 --> 00:04:47,729
has a name but it doesn't have a soul so

103
00:04:47,729 --> 00:04:49,729
it's not the same you cannot really

104
00:04:49,729 --> 00:04:52,949
pretend to do something that the human

105
00:04:52,949 --> 00:04:56,400
can can do but anyway we can also

106
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,580
interact with the computer and if we

107
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:01,440
take a look at music videos we cannot

108
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,629
interact with music videos it's like you

109
00:05:03,629 --> 00:05:06,000
watch it and that's it so there is a

110
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,099
place for improvement there is a place

111
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:10,440
to do something interesting in there we

112
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:12,990
can take the basic idea of rotoscoping

113
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:16,650
and take it into the browser so if we

114
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:18,300
take a look at these part of the video

115
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:21,060
of heartens by Paramore we can see that

116
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:23,069
there are free layers we see a

117
00:05:23,069 --> 00:05:25,500
background layer with kind of blue 1

118
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,900
yellow moving things then there is a

119
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:30,180
second layer in that second layer we'll

120
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:32,969
see these two people dancing and on top

121
00:05:32,969 --> 00:05:35,159
of them we got a rotoscoping we got

122
00:05:35,159 --> 00:05:37,409
these lines that are moving around and

123
00:05:37,409 --> 00:05:40,380
if you look at the back and like behind

124
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:42,960
the scenes we got this which is really

125
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,840
funny to watch what they did was

126
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,060
actually they recorded this video they

127
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:50,449
reverse it so it's actually reversed

128
00:05:50,449 --> 00:05:54,060
they remove that green background fill

129
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:56,430
it with this kind of yellow and blue

130
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:59,460
animations put themselves and on top of

131
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:02,580
that the other animations so we can do

132
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:04,500
something like this we can begin with

133
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:07,020
this we can remove the green background

134
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:09,539
and add something else there is

135
00:06:09,539 --> 00:06:11,219
something called chroma key and it's

136
00:06:11,219 --> 00:06:15,090
really common in movies like Avengers so

137
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:18,090
what they do is they record a movie with

138
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:20,639
a green or blue background white green

139
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:23,219
and blue or not because it's Percy B

140
00:06:23,219 --> 00:06:25,740
well we cannot really use well because

141
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:28,349
our faces have a tendency to be red so

142
00:06:28,349 --> 00:06:30,509
we have to choose either green or blue

143
00:06:30,509 --> 00:06:32,639
which has the two colors we don't

144
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:35,399
usually have on our skin and of course

145
00:06:35,399 --> 00:06:36,300
if we will use

146
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:37,650
the green background we don't wear a

147
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:40,680
green if we use blue we can wear please

148
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:43,169
and once you've got that once you got

149
00:06:43,169 --> 00:06:45,419
that blue or green background you need

150
00:06:45,419 --> 00:06:48,120
really good light and I mean really good

151
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:48,599
light

152
00:06:48,599 --> 00:06:52,039
and that means use not natural light

153
00:06:52,039 --> 00:06:54,840
natural light is like that level for

154
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:57,150
animations if you have ever work on in

155
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:59,879
stop-motion animation or even work on

156
00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:01,620
something like chroma key you will

157
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:03,270
understand that natural light is

158
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:06,810
horrible simply because these kind of

159
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:09,389
animations take so much time that maybe

160
00:07:09,389 --> 00:07:12,030
you expect any towers working on it and

161
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:14,699
in those eight hours the earth moves

162
00:07:14,699 --> 00:07:17,639
around the Sun so suddenly only shadows

163
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:20,069
move and that is a disaster so we don't

164
00:07:20,069 --> 00:07:22,560
want really this kind of natural light

165
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,539
we prefer these lights whenever we work

166
00:07:24,539 --> 00:07:27,120
with animations or in this case with

167
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,370
chroma key so let me see

168
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:31,259
chroma key now let's make chroma key

169
00:07:31,259 --> 00:07:33,509
with the users camera because again we

170
00:07:33,509 --> 00:07:34,949
are in the web we can actually enjoy

171
00:07:34,949 --> 00:07:38,580
this so to do this what we need to do is

172
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:41,279
to take the users input camera and take

173
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:43,199
that input and put it into a video tab

174
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:46,229
now we cannot edit a video tag so we

175
00:07:46,229 --> 00:07:48,900
need to copy that into a canvas and then

176
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:51,330
process that canvas and what we will do

177
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:54,090
is remove the green or the blue and

178
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:56,880
replace that with something else so

179
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:59,069
first step take the users camera input

180
00:07:59,069 --> 00:08:01,279
to do this we actually use getusermedia

181
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:04,289
which is really simple to use and it's

182
00:08:04,289 --> 00:08:06,629
available a loss in every browser this

183
00:08:06,629 --> 00:08:08,610
will return a promise and then we can

184
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:09,919
work on it

185
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:13,620
so we got our B data with an ID of video

186
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:16,440
and we copy all this streaming from the

187
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:19,169
camera into that video and if it doesn't

188
00:08:19,169 --> 00:08:21,990
work we just throw an error message and

189
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:29,639
we get something like this anywhere it's

190
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:32,310
kind of ok so you got your video tag you

191
00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:35,159
accept the job prompt assess would you

192
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:38,579
allow using your video and perfect so

193
00:08:38,579 --> 00:08:42,269
let's copy that into a canvas tag so we

194
00:08:42,269 --> 00:08:44,910
get to create our canvas with an ID of

195
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:48,530
canvas because I'm really creative and

196
00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:51,710
then we basically allow 2d context and

197
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:54,620
we create a function like this so what

198
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:56,600
this function will do is it will take

199
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:59,270
all the information from our video from

200
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:01,880
the top left corner on to the bottom

201
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:04,250
right corner and it will copy it into

202
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:08,090
our canvas now if you only use this code

203
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:10,760
we will have one issue that is that only

204
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:13,640
we will see the first frame of the video

205
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:16,160
copy into the canvas and then the video

206
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,290
will keep on a streaming but it canvas

207
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:20,480
one refresh so we need to refresh the

208
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,240
canvas all the time there are so many

209
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,310
great performance talk in this

210
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:27,200
conference that's why mine is not

211
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,600
performant we are going to do a set time

212
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:33,560
out of zero so we do it the time out the

213
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:36,200
zero we get something like this we get

214
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,060
the prompt will you share your camera

215
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:40,460
with this website years and then we get

216
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:42,320
the videos on the left the original

217
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,860
video and on the right the canvas and

218
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:51,080
something else we get my cut so it works

219
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:53,570
it works perfectly and it refreshes all

220
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:56,420
the time so next is to process the

221
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:58,190
cameras is to remove the green or the

222
00:09:58,190 --> 00:10:00,800
blue for that we need to do something

223
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,230
called pixel manipulation so we need to

224
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:05,270
actually kind of remember a little bit

225
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:07,730
about what is a pixel now I know this is

226
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:09,710
a front-end conference but let's take a

227
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:12,860
closer look anyway so a pixel is the

228
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:15,740
tiniest part of a video or an image like

229
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:19,250
this a pixel has information in this

230
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:22,100
case or shibi information so if we take

231
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:24,320
a look at this pink we are actually

232
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:28,160
taking a look at this red blast screen

233
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:32,930
plus this blue and all those free audio

234
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:34,550
returns this pink

235
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:39,560
an RGB goes from 0 to 255 0 being black

236
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:42,710
and 255 being the strongest rather

237
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:44,540
stronger screen and the strongest blue

238
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:47,030
so in this case we got a really strong

239
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:50,360
red a kind of dark green and a kind of

240
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:53,510
in the middle blue under so through the

241
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:55,460
alpha Channel and I know this sounds

242
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:57,500
weird because there is not such a thing

243
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:00,950
as transparency in videos but anyway

244
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:01,769
when we ask

245
00:11:01,769 --> 00:11:03,860
information in will return the alpha-2

246
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:07,800
so what we will do right now is we will

247
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,739
ask for every pixel information of every

248
00:11:10,739 --> 00:11:13,439
frame that our video is getting and we

249
00:11:13,439 --> 00:11:15,329
will ask for the red value of the green

250
00:11:15,329 --> 00:11:18,959
value w value and the Alpha value and

251
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:22,739
then we will turn that alpha value into

252
00:11:22,739 --> 00:11:26,519
zero so that will be the trick so we

253
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:28,170
find the green pixels and we'll read

254
00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:30,509
them with them to find the good pixels

255
00:11:30,509 --> 00:11:32,189
we need to take a look at the

256
00:11:32,189 --> 00:11:34,259
information of the video so to do that

257
00:11:34,259 --> 00:11:37,110
we use get image data get image data

258
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:38,910
will return all the information from

259
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:42,499
every part of the video in an RGB a way

260
00:11:42,499 --> 00:11:45,389
plus it will return the height and the

261
00:11:45,389 --> 00:11:48,569
width of the video so when I cancel not

262
00:11:48,569 --> 00:11:51,119
that I get this which is okay the width

263
00:11:51,119 --> 00:11:54,749
of the video is 480 the the height is

264
00:11:54,749 --> 00:11:59,100
480 the with a 640 and here it is the

265
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:02,699
1.2 million array because yeah why

266
00:12:02,699 --> 00:12:04,860
wouldn't you need the 1.2 million all

267
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:07,920
right when is this 1.2 million because

268
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,779
it seems like a random number it's

269
00:12:09,779 --> 00:12:12,089
actually the width of the video multiply

270
00:12:12,089 --> 00:12:13,980
the height of the video multiply 4

271
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:16,709
because 4 is the number of information

272
00:12:16,709 --> 00:12:19,139
that you get from each pixel the red the

273
00:12:19,139 --> 00:12:21,779
green the blue and the alpha so if you

274
00:12:21,779 --> 00:12:25,429
open that if it is so you open it again

275
00:12:25,429 --> 00:12:29,339
and again and again and suddenly you get

276
00:12:29,339 --> 00:12:32,249
to the important part so in this part it

277
00:12:32,249 --> 00:12:34,559
looks like random numbers again but we

278
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:38,399
can find a sequence the sequence is 255

279
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:40,589
so we know that video doesn't have

280
00:12:40,589 --> 00:12:43,079
transparency so that must be the Alpha

281
00:12:43,079 --> 00:12:45,509
and if that is the alpha that means of

282
00:12:45,509 --> 00:12:48,749
we can identify the others is rgbi your

283
00:12:48,749 --> 00:12:50,790
GPA you should be a of every pixel

284
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:53,759
beginning from the top left so if we

285
00:12:53,759 --> 00:12:56,279
take a look at the first pixel we get

286
00:12:56,279 --> 00:12:59,040
this value which is equal to this her

287
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:02,669
GPA so what get there is something like

288
00:13:02,669 --> 00:13:03,480
blueish

289
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:08,399
yeah because it's 55 red 74 of blue and

290
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:12,929
86 of green of sorry 74 of green and

291
00:13:12,929 --> 00:13:15,059
ethicists of blue 16 of lewisham is

292
00:13:15,059 --> 00:13:16,019
really dark

293
00:13:16,019 --> 00:13:18,899
those are really low values and the one

294
00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:23,189
of the alpha so let's go through all

295
00:13:23,189 --> 00:13:25,829
that data and let's find the green

296
00:13:25,829 --> 00:13:28,529
pixels and we need to identify them we

297
00:13:28,529 --> 00:13:30,899
identify the red values the green values

298
00:13:30,899 --> 00:13:33,480
and the blue values and then we ask if

299
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,730
the Green is greater than the blue and

300
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:37,980
it will Green is greater than the red if

301
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:39,869
that is the case I'm going to turn the

302
00:13:39,869 --> 00:13:43,139
opacity value to syrup and then I have

303
00:13:43,139 --> 00:13:45,480
to return this new information to our

304
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:49,980
cameras so this gets us something like

305
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:57,629
this which looks really bad I mean it

306
00:13:57,629 --> 00:14:00,119
works but we cannot really happy on

307
00:14:00,119 --> 00:14:02,220
celebrating because of that so we need

308
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:04,049
to improve it there are two things that

309
00:14:04,049 --> 00:14:05,850
are really wrong in there first one is a

310
00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:08,819
right that is natural light that's why I

311
00:14:08,819 --> 00:14:10,920
say natural light is not the devil you

312
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,929
don't do natural light you can see that

313
00:14:12,929 --> 00:14:15,269
it's like a lot of light coming from one

314
00:14:15,269 --> 00:14:18,299
side and nothing from the other and then

315
00:14:18,299 --> 00:14:21,089
we need to remove the colors only if the

316
00:14:21,089 --> 00:14:24,569
greens are bigger than 100 why because

317
00:14:24,569 --> 00:14:26,759
as you can see part of my hair has been

318
00:14:26,759 --> 00:14:29,369
taken away I mean hair is not green as

319
00:14:29,369 --> 00:14:32,509
far as I know but it's brown and

320
00:14:32,509 --> 00:14:36,420
basically browns and grays have a value

321
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:39,360
of red green and blue so even though if

322
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,699
those values are really low the computer

323
00:14:41,699 --> 00:14:43,559
will is still identified it's only has

324
00:14:43,559 --> 00:14:45,839
only one more pixel screen and it will

325
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:47,549
pick it a screen even though we listen

326
00:14:47,549 --> 00:14:50,009
so whenever it is too dark whenever the

327
00:14:50,009 --> 00:14:52,829
value is too close to zero we really

328
00:14:52,829 --> 00:14:55,110
cannot trust it so we won't remove

329
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:57,959
values that are lower than 100 because

330
00:14:57,959 --> 00:15:00,059
those are dark values and we are not

331
00:15:00,059 --> 00:15:02,490
sure if they are really green off or if

332
00:15:02,490 --> 00:15:06,629
they art may be grounds or grace so we

333
00:15:06,629 --> 00:15:12,029
get something like this in return so I

334
00:15:12,029 --> 00:15:14,249
kind of worked better we have now no

335
00:15:14,249 --> 00:15:18,209
natural light we have to remove only the

336
00:15:18,209 --> 00:15:20,999
greens if they are bigger than 100 so as

337
00:15:20,999 --> 00:15:23,489
you can see my hair is normal again but

338
00:15:23,489 --> 00:15:25,319
there is something wrong with my t-shirt

339
00:15:25,319 --> 00:15:27,990
I know what you're gonna say it's a

340
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:29,430
Harry Potter t-shirt it's magic

341
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:33,750
yes but also is white and white has a

342
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:36,089
tendency to take in a lot of the colors

343
00:15:36,089 --> 00:15:39,120
from the surroundings so I could either

344
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,310
modify my cold or change my t-shirt

345
00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:42,779
guess what

346
00:15:42,779 --> 00:15:45,720
and I changed my t-shirts that's why I'm

347
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:49,290
running back today this is what every

348
00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:52,380
developer week at home so let's try it

349
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:59,790
we'll die let's see so I got these will

350
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:01,020
you share your coming around

351
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:02,580
I got our goat cheek with two cameras I

352
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:04,020
got the camera from the computer and

353
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:05,940
they lend me this one so I'm going to

354
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:08,330
use this camera which is much better

355
00:16:08,330 --> 00:16:12,480
Here I am so this is the video on the

356
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,540
left from the canvas on the right and I

357
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:17,459
made this kind of drop-down where you

358
00:16:17,459 --> 00:16:19,050
can select if you want to filter green

359
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:22,080
or blue it's in green Rina so we got

360
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:22,589
this

361
00:16:22,589 --> 00:16:24,899
when we open weave and when you can

362
00:16:24,899 --> 00:16:27,870
please know how works because of the

363
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:36,390
background thank you and if you turn it

364
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:41,040
into blue you can see the same but in

365
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,959
all the filters blue are not no longer

366
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:45,779
green so that's pretty cool but let's

367
00:16:45,779 --> 00:16:47,610
make something even cooler which is

368
00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:50,910
basically invisibility cloak because if

369
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:53,130
you're like Harry Potter why wouldn't

370
00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:55,350
you make an invisibility cloak so how

371
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:58,170
does it work well you need to take a

372
00:16:58,170 --> 00:17:03,870
picture of your background without you

373
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:07,230
so I'm going to move over here let's

374
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:09,420
take this tell you that and I'm going to

375
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:12,990
take a picture of that and then I'm

376
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:14,730
going to use that as a background

377
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:18,449
instead of the hard words so let's take

378
00:17:18,449 --> 00:17:21,390
this picture the one I just took I'm

379
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:25,170
going to copy it into our images folder

380
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:27,209
right next to her words let's go up in a

381
00:17:27,209 --> 00:17:31,490
name and let's modify our beautiful CSS

382
00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:35,100
so one longer it will not no longer be

383
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:40,250
hard words will be windows some fan set

384
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:42,280
so we can refresh

385
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:44,770
and we get that that's lack of any mesh

386
00:17:44,770 --> 00:17:49,060
that's great we are going to allow the

387
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:52,240
camera see did I use the right camera

388
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:56,470
that's my question yes there's a right

389
00:17:56,470 --> 00:18:00,250
time around that's good well she's the

390
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:03,820
other camera over here alright and we

391
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:06,610
are filtering green so we're twin and

392
00:18:06,610 --> 00:18:08,830
the thing you need to do is like to

393
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:11,980
cover yourself and that's it it's pretty

394
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:17,410
simple it's like it's done and invisible

395
00:18:17,410 --> 00:18:24,840
[Applause]

396
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:26,350
thank you very much

397
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:29,950
it also works with blue because you

398
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:32,440
always anytime you get a chance to make

399
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:34,450
get silly of your selfies like please do

400
00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:39,460
so so it's the best dress you can get

401
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:41,200
for a conference when you are an

402
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:48,370
introvert so one final point over here

403
00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:50,620
which is what happens if I want to make

404
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:52,810
something else what happiness we we

405
00:18:52,810 --> 00:18:54,610
don't only not only want to modify the

406
00:18:54,610 --> 00:18:58,540
backgrounds that's my fault like so more

407
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:02,350
victim manipulation I can paramour video

408
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:05,860
in this part the tap if they had the

409
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:07,960
singer is dancing and at the same time

410
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,370
there are cheaper she would suffer

411
00:19:09,370 --> 00:19:12,250
dancing as well with the same moves so

412
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:13,990
there is rotoscoping somebody actually

413
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:16,680
draw that and copy it right next to her

414
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:20,230
so we can do something like that I'm not

415
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:21,580
going to dance that would be awkward

416
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:24,340
they know so if it dancing so we are

417
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:26,470
going to grab this gift of Taylor Swift

418
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:29,670
we are going to remove the background

419
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:32,260
and then we are going to copy Taylor

420
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:35,550
Swift so now we get free Taylor Swift I

421
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:39,310
I also kind of shrink that you all are

422
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:41,350
Taylor Swift so it gets a kind of nicer

423
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:43,540
effect but you don't really need to do

424
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:44,040
that

425
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:46,990
so to copy the Taylor Swift what you do

426
00:19:46,990 --> 00:19:49,000
is create another canvas and then you

427
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,580
position them with position relative and

428
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:56,920
absolute then after you copy them you

429
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:59,590
need to make them pink so what you need

430
00:19:59,590 --> 00:20:02,680
to make being is not the green area

431
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:04,360
because the green is gone you need to

432
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:07,660
make pink what is left of the green so

433
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:09,940
we used to have an ephah statement we

434
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:11,430
are going to use the else

435
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:17,170
so if what is left is not a green pixel

436
00:20:17,170 --> 00:20:18,940
what we are going to do is we are going

437
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:21,880
to grab the zero value on the number two

438
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:24,550
value and the zero value number two are

439
00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:26,320
the information from the green and the

440
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:29,080
blue so if you put a high value of green

441
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:32,110
of bread and a high value of blue what

442
00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:35,890
you get is kind of pink so high

443
00:20:35,890 --> 00:20:39,550
Plus hi blue give us pink in the second

444
00:20:39,550 --> 00:20:41,620
and said also found in the third Taylor

445
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:44,170
Swift so you get something like this

446
00:20:44,170 --> 00:20:47,020
which is Taylor Swift dancing and pink

447
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:50,350
leadership decides and if you want to

448
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:51,250
make it better

449
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,900
you cannot kittens because they always

450
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:56,110
make sense better and since we have any

451
00:20:56,110 --> 00:20:58,330
JavaScript conference it can only act

452
00:20:58,330 --> 00:21:05,860
logos because why wouldn't you so I know

453
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:07,690
it's not what the scope in because like

454
00:21:07,690 --> 00:21:09,310
yeah and it's a computer it's not a

455
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:11,530
human doing that but it's pretty cool

456
00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:13,510
and you can do a lot of stuff we can

457
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:16,090
really open your mind to whatever you

458
00:21:16,090 --> 00:21:18,370
want and he was in your browser I mean

459
00:21:18,370 --> 00:21:20,320
when I was a child and I used to like

460
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,810
this kind of green screen things I used

461
00:21:22,810 --> 00:21:25,720
to actually pirate Adobe Premiere and

462
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:27,520
Adobe After Effects because I couldn't

463
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,340
afford noise like 15 so I no longer

464
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:32,500
think that now I got my own software now

465
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,210
I got the browser and I can do that we

466
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:36,790
shall expect so thank you very much for

467
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:38,740
listening I will leave you with these

468
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:42,280
links if I were you I wouldn't open the

469
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:44,020
second one on my phone because he

470
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:46,150
crushed mine is actually the online

471
00:21:46,150 --> 00:21:48,280
version of that so I hope you enjoy

472
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:52,240
thank you very much
