00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:16,750

hi cool so my name is Brian Holt

2
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:18,610
currently working at Netflix and this is

3
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:20,110
the most ill-advised talk I've ever

4
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:22,960
given in the sense that there's so many

5
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,580
moving technology pieces that something

6
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:26,169
is Brown to bound to break and I'm

7
00:00:26,169 --> 00:00:28,290
excited to find out which one it is

8
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:31,360
so my first ill-advised piece is I'm

9
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:33,250
going to be giving a talk out of the

10
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:36,370
command line because that's a good idea

11
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:38,590
throughout this entire talk please feel

12
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:42,190
free to tweet at Jas Kampf is there's

13
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:43,570
going to be several poll questions and

14
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:45,640
you can answer them and they should

15
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:48,370
magically appear up here first one is

16
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:50,379
what's your favorite framework of choice

17
00:00:50,379 --> 00:00:52,210
and looks like people are already

18
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:55,420
tweeting react I think that's just

19
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:56,620
because that's the name of the talk so

20
00:00:56,620 --> 00:01:00,339
whatever deal with it cool so I'm going

21
00:01:00,339 --> 00:01:02,319
to talk about react and the idea of

22
00:01:02,319 --> 00:01:04,629
learn once right anywhere and this is

23
00:01:04,629 --> 00:01:06,850
kind of struck me while is reading their

24
00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:08,620
Docs one day that the idea of learned

25
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:10,870
once right anywhere most of us are

26
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:13,480
familiar with PhoneGap or cordova or

27
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:17,070
ionic or any one of these particular

28
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:21,100
frameworks that are trying to be write

29
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:23,200
once run anywhere and to me that's kind

30
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,810
of a pipe dream so that's why I kind of

31
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:27,760
latched on to react learn once write

32
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:30,640
anywhere so let's talk a little bit I'm

33
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,170
yeah I'm Brian Holt whatever no one

34
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:34,810
cares and I work at Netflix which is a

35
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:37,240
pretty great I like wasting all of your

36
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:40,210
time and by where I used to work before

37
00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:42,430
Netflix was reddit so I really like

38
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:44,710
wasting your time

39
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:47,329
cool so let's uh let's chitchat a sec

40
00:01:47,329 --> 00:01:49,189
about react first of all if you ever

41
00:01:49,189 --> 00:01:50,600
moment if you went to a Linds talk it

42
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:53,479
was fantastic about performance I gave

43
00:01:53,479 --> 00:01:54,560
you a little bit more high-level if

44
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,819
you're not intimately familiar with

45
00:01:55,819 --> 00:01:59,689
react so it's a library for creating

46
00:01:59,689 --> 00:02:02,090
views and that's kind of like just the

47
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:03,890
high level that's exactly what react is

48
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:07,549
for it was created for the Dom I'm not

49
00:02:07,549 --> 00:02:09,769
mistaken was created at Instagram and

50
00:02:09,769 --> 00:02:11,450
then just kind of slowly took over

51
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:13,420
everything in the entire world including

52
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:18,709
Netflix Facebook Firefox what else is

53
00:02:18,709 --> 00:02:20,120
out there lots of things are now being

54
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:24,200
written and react super super great

55
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,360
library it's a pattern for writing you

56
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:30,860
eyes and so we kind of got stuck with

57
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:33,610
MVC as front-end developers right like

58
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:36,560
MVC is super awesome for the backend if

59
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,390
you ever written Ruby on Rails Django

60
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:41,049
like that kind of abstraction of MVC

61
00:02:41,049 --> 00:02:43,489
Model View controller works really

62
00:02:43,489 --> 00:02:46,370
really well hey looks something like the

63
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:50,180
backbone go team so it works really

64
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:52,730
really well for the for the backend like

65
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:54,260
this this separation of concerns if you

66
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:55,790
have the models to talk to the database

67
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:57,139
you have the views that actually talk

68
00:02:57,139 --> 00:02:58,609
out to the clients and if the thin

69
00:02:58,609 --> 00:03:00,230
little controllers that kind of wire all

70
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:01,609
your data about this works super well

71
00:03:01,609 --> 00:03:03,829
for for back-end programming and then

72
00:03:03,829 --> 00:03:05,870
people that was like this is an awesome

73
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:09,049
idea I'm going to apply this to to the

74
00:03:09,049 --> 00:03:10,760
Dom and it turned out that it's actually

75
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,620
not such an awesome idea if anyone's I

76
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:15,319
maintained a huge backbone app before it

77
00:03:15,319 --> 00:03:17,510
can fall apart at the seams sometimes

78
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:19,730
there are great backbones out backbone

79
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:21,470
apps out there but you have to be very

80
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:25,549
disciplined to get them to work well so

81
00:03:25,549 --> 00:03:28,160
some daring individuals decided to look

82
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,299
at this and said there has to be a

83
00:03:29,299 --> 00:03:31,519
better way we should write a paradigm

84
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:34,010
that's specifically for writing UI

85
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:36,260
libraries and so they kind of came up

86
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:39,319
with this idea of request/response right

87
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:41,120
because that's kind of what the web has

88
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,940
been like for four years right like you

89
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:45,500
request a web page and you get back a

90
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:48,230
web page that's kind of the idea so they

91
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:50,060
have to say well we can kind of

92
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:52,880
generalize this abstraction and

93
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:55,880
apply it to more of a JavaScript

94
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,440
framework so they kind of came with this

95
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:00,140
idea of given a set of state so I'm

96
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:01,520
going to throw in state and I'm going to

97
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:06,170
get an output of abdomin ever my user

98
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:09,830
interface time I'm looking for this

99
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:11,600
ended up being really really great and

100
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,800
then they came up with a bunch of crazy

101
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,390
ideas of like how they can implement it

102
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:17,120
like the virtual DOM and crazy like

103
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,410
that but in the end of that you actually

104
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:19,640
don't have to care whenever you're

105
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,859
writing react for the most part you

106
00:04:21,859 --> 00:04:23,510
don't really have to care how it's doing

107
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:25,280
it you just have to write your cosign

108
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:28,040
given this set of state my output looks

109
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:32,000
like this while JavaScript and go team

110
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:38,060
okay so let's take a second to talk

111
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:40,250
about what exactly is going on with this

112
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:42,710
craziness up here this is written for a

113
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:45,080
library called blessed did anyone check

114
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:48,770
out ken wheelers web packed dashboard

115
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:51,200
anyone see that come up on Twitter yeah

116
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:54,560
super cool right same library I used it

117
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,690
first though so suck on a Ken

118
00:04:56,690 --> 00:05:00,650
I hope he's watching the live feed so

119
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:03,590
I'm gonna herd it curses right like this

120
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:04,669
is blessed

121
00:05:04,669 --> 00:05:06,229
right that's instead of being cursed as

122
00:05:06,229 --> 00:05:08,690
its blessed it's a it's a dumb joke but

123
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:10,970
that's what they went with so blessed is

124
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:14,120
a you can write user interfaces for the

125
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:17,870
command line using node right that's all

126
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:20,120
blessed is and then someone's thoughts

127
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,860
like well I mean we're writing user

128
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:24,320
interfaces why can't we point react at

129
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,729
that so that this actually is written in

130
00:05:25,729 --> 00:05:28,640
react blessed so I wrote a user

131
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,740
interface for the command line using

132
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:33,530
react which is pretty awesome so I was

133
00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:34,970
able to use all the same tools that I

134
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:38,479
used for the Dom use Babel whatever and

135
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:41,150
I was able to target the command line

136
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:42,890
using react which i think is pretty cool

137
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:45,229
so yeah let's go back to to talking

138
00:05:45,229 --> 00:05:51,900
about react for just just a moment here

139
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:54,590
actually JK lol we're gonna go back for

140
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:58,280
just a sec so most of us are have worked

141
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,540
with react before or these sort of

142
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:00,530
familiar with it and there's two

143
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:02,360
packages here there's react and there's

144
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:04,400
react Dom right and this is kind of

145
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,930
confusing for newcomers to the

146
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:07,520
to the react world because they're

147
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,680
thinking I don't understand why I need

148
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,509
both these packages i have i want to

149
00:06:11,509 --> 00:06:13,340
write react and I want it to render out

150
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:15,380
to the Dom that's kind of way it started

151
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:20,530
right up and through til react point

152
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:22,520
1314 something in that area

153
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,470
those were the same package you just

154
00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:26,150
downloaded one react and it just worked

155
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:29,360
and then these crazy people over

156
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,400
Facebook's like let's write react and

157
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:34,580
have it target iOS and Android and so

158
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:36,979
they started writing these react

159
00:06:36,979 --> 00:06:38,690
components that instead of targeting the

160
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:40,970
Dom they started targeting native

161
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:43,910
platforms and so they realized like

162
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:45,440
we're using the same paradigms using the

163
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,910
same lifecycle methods all these

164
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:48,590
different pieces that are built straight

165
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:50,720
into react they're regarding real react

166
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,449
components and just that last mile right

167
00:06:53,449 --> 00:06:55,430
the last mile of delivery was the only

168
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:56,599
part that difference so they decided

169
00:06:56,599 --> 00:06:57,860
like let's break out the part that

170
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:00,169
actually writes it out to the Dom call

171
00:07:00,169 --> 00:07:02,229
that react Dom and now we have this

172
00:07:02,229 --> 00:07:04,639
generalized react library that it

173
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:05,870
doesn't actually care what it's

174
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:07,699
targeting it just makes components right

175
00:07:07,699 --> 00:07:10,340
it's just a way of declaring the way

176
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:12,560
that your components should look and now

177
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,840
we can do things like react native and

178
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,639
react blessed and all these other crazy

179
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:18,139
things that people shouldn't do but are

180
00:07:18,139 --> 00:07:23,900
gonna do anyway like this talk so that's

181
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:25,340
what that's what react blessed is that's

182
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:27,409
what react Dom is is that's these last

183
00:07:27,409 --> 00:07:28,789
mile libraries and that's kind of what

184
00:07:28,789 --> 00:07:31,250
this talk is about is all the crazy

185
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:33,680
awesome stuff you can do with the react

186
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,570
library just by swapping out that last

187
00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:41,990
mile cool so yeah let's go back to

188
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:44,720
talking about why react is so cool and

189
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,220
why is kind of took off right like it's

190
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:48,530
the new shininess that everyone's

191
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:49,370
talking about

192
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:51,050
half these conference talks are about

193
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:52,970
them like if you write angular or

194
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:54,169
empress Peschel if you write ember

195
00:07:54,169 --> 00:07:55,550
you're probably sick about hearing about

196
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:57,349
react but let me tell you still why it's

197
00:07:57,349 --> 00:08:00,849
cool it's about creating components and

198
00:08:00,849 --> 00:08:03,440
that's for me that's kind of the bottom

199
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:06,020
line like you instead of having these in

200
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:08,360
in terms of UI development arbitrary

201
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:11,120
separation of concerns we decided to

202
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,039
take all the concerns for very small

203
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:14,360
pieces and then just mush them all

204
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,599
together in just this unholy matrimony

205
00:08:16,599 --> 00:08:18,840
which ends up being really

206
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:23,240
great I'm doing a great job selling it

207
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:25,949
so you take all these components and are

208
00:08:25,949 --> 00:08:27,479
these concerns and you mash them all

209
00:08:27,479 --> 00:08:30,720
together for these very small components

210
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,789
but what's really really awesome by

211
00:08:32,789 --> 00:08:35,669
smashing all these concerns together if

212
00:08:35,669 --> 00:08:37,890
you're looking at your you know webpage

213
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:39,839
and say like the the login buttons

214
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:41,279
broken like the text is wrong or

215
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:43,110
something like that let's pretend for a

216
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:44,700
second that this is angular and I pick

217
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:45,960
on angular just because it's the one I

218
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,910
know the best but lots of frameworks

219
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:49,020
have had this problem before it could be

220
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:50,640
a jQuery app it could be just a plain

221
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,130
vanilla GIS app you look at it you see

222
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:55,230
the button text is wrong and you think

223
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:58,520
okay I have a bug where is my bug I

224
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:01,080
don't know if it's angular it could be

225
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,910
the directive it could be the controller

226
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:05,370
it could be the template it could be the

227
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:07,410
template for the directive it could be

228
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:08,670
one of the many services that you

229
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:10,020
decided to inject it could be the

230
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:11,130
library that brought it in right like

231
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:13,470
there's just all in other words you have

232
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:16,529
no goddamn clue where it is right just

233
00:09:16,529 --> 00:09:17,730
by knowing that you have a bug you are

234
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:19,940
not really not much closer to finding it

235
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:22,560
now what's nice about react if you see

236
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,959
the component has a problem with it the

237
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:27,510
problem is in the component like it just

238
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:29,250
has to be there because all the concerns

239
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:33,330
lived there now I'm simplifying a tiny

240
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:34,770
bit right like I guess it could come

241
00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:37,589
from like a ie user interface library

242
00:09:37,589 --> 00:09:39,420
that that you are using in conjunction

243
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:41,100
or something something to that effect

244
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:44,730
but my point still stands that you have

245
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:46,830
a very very good intuition of where it

246
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:48,600
lives and you have at least the

247
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,370
beginning of the trail to go find what's

248
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:53,070
wrong with it and I think that's having

249
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:54,570
a beginning point when finding a bug is

250
00:09:54,570 --> 00:10:02,310
already a huge step up so yeah it's a

251
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:04,170
pattern for creating user interfaces

252
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:06,750
that's what react is is a pattern for

253
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:10,620
user interfaces and other communities

254
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:12,270
started eyeing this and say like this is

255
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:14,220
really great like I like this

256
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:15,900
declarative method of declaring my

257
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:18,390
components saying kind of this reactive

258
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:20,700
way of saying okay given the set state

259
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:22,260
and these props need to change will I

260
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:24,420
pass down to my children it just made

261
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:25,830
sense and not only does it make sense

262
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:27,450
for the Dom it makes sense for a lot of

263
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:30,540
user interfaces as you can see here this

264
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:31,980
was really easy to write this didn't

265
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:32,310
take me

266
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:33,779
very many lines of code that I wrote an

267
00:10:33,779 --> 00:10:38,160
entire presentation giving kind of piece

268
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,920
of let's be totally honest but I

269
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,480
wrote this with not too many lines of

270
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,910
code now if I asked you today to go out

271
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:47,550
and know today and write user interfaces

272
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:49,710
for the command line first of all you'd

273
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:52,350
be like why the secondly it'd be kind of

274
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:53,820
hard to get started with that but using

275
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,890
react this was actually really easy like

276
00:10:55,890 --> 00:10:57,570
I don't have to know anything about

277
00:10:57,570 --> 00:10:59,700
writing for the command line and to be

278
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:00,930
honest I really don't know that much

279
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:02,580
about it but I know a lot about writing

280
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:03,870
react because I've been doing it for a

281
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:05,100
long time and I was able to knock this

282
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:07,440
out super fast because I was able to

283
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,029
take that those same things I had

284
00:11:09,029 --> 00:11:10,350
learned for writing react to the Dom

285
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:14,160
read writing react for native and

286
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,110
actually even at Netflix were writing it

287
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:19,680
for on TVs ps4 is Xbox is that kind of

288
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:20,940
stuff I was able to take those same

289
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:22,500
learnings and apply here and I think

290
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,839
that's that's pretty powerful I was able

291
00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:27,510
to target a platform that I really don't

292
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:30,060
know too much about which is pretty

293
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:33,390
fantastic so again this is not the dream

294
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:38,160
of write once run anywhere right I can't

295
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,870
take this same code and try and run in

296
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:41,330
the browser I can't run it on a TV

297
00:11:41,330 --> 00:11:44,460
that's that's not a useful target at

298
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:46,320
least in terms of the technology in my

299
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,170
opinion available today to us however

300
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:51,000
the idea that I can learn this paradigm

301
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,460
once and then apply it in many places

302
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:55,620
very very fascinating to me and so far

303
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:58,140
has pretty well held out in fact react

304
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:00,750
in terms of its ecosystem today is very

305
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:02,910
much about in embracing the differences

306
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:04,800
in all the different platforms if you're

307
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,570
writing react native for Android you're

308
00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:08,850
encouraged to if you need to drop into

309
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:10,830
the Java layer in you know knock out a

310
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:12,600
couple pieces and then have that plug

311
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:15,000
back in to react native those are scape

312
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,890
hatches they're not only like available

313
00:12:16,890 --> 00:12:19,560
but they're encouraged and the same

314
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,030
thing with react Dom if you need to you

315
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:22,709
know in component in mount and reference

316
00:12:22,709 --> 00:12:25,920
the window bringing a jQuery plug-in for

317
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,350
who else who knows why I wouldn't

318
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:29,760
suggest it but if you need to do it you

319
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,170
can do it right and so it's about

320
00:12:31,170 --> 00:12:32,550
embracing the differences in the

321
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:36,420
platforms so let's let's just take a

322
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:39,089
little sidetrack to JSX

323
00:12:39,089 --> 00:12:41,220
let's be honest about people that wrote

324
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:43,110
react who do not write react at first

325
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:44,600
because I had JSX

326
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:47,720
this guy this guy right here I saw JSX

327
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:50,600
and I was like this is dumb like I just

328
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,610
got JavaScript out of my HTML I sure as

329
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:53,810
hell I'm not puttin HTML in my

330
00:12:53,810 --> 00:12:55,699
JavaScript like that was that was my

331
00:12:55,699 --> 00:12:57,350
reaction when I first saw that blog post

332
00:12:57,350 --> 00:12:58,970
come out from Facebook like you guys

333
00:12:58,970 --> 00:13:02,540
just go write your PHP your special PHP

334
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:05,990
and leave me alone and then I came back

335
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:07,910
like a year later as like I was

336
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:10,220
wrong this is actually really great so

337
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:11,720
let's talk about like what is jsx it

338
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,490
basically lets you write eight XML like

339
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:15,339
syntax aka

340
00:13:15,339 --> 00:13:19,759
HTML for the most part directly in your

341
00:13:19,759 --> 00:13:22,940
JavaScript and it's really just syntax

342
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:24,889
sugar for that just transpile x' two

343
00:13:24,889 --> 00:13:27,500
function calls that's 100% of what JSX

344
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:30,470
is but the reason why I like it is I'm

345
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:35,389
writing code to mimic markup right like

346
00:13:35,389 --> 00:13:36,500
ultimately that's what I want to do I

347
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:38,329
want to write code that ends up being

348
00:13:38,329 --> 00:13:40,880
markup so if I'm writing code that's

349
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,440
going to end up being markup wouldn't it

350
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:44,300
be great if I could just write the

351
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:45,709
markup right and just get that kind of

352
00:13:45,709 --> 00:13:49,759
middle step so that's what JSX aims to

353
00:13:49,759 --> 00:13:51,470
be is like you're trying to get HTML

354
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:53,420
ultimately output to the Dom so just

355
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:55,639
write the HTML and then they'll

356
00:13:55,639 --> 00:13:56,889
transpile it into something that

357
00:13:56,889 --> 00:13:59,959
actually really works in JavaScript and

358
00:13:59,959 --> 00:14:01,339
for the most part introducing a build

359
00:14:01,339 --> 00:14:02,300
stuff is not really a problem anymore

360
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:05,630
because most of us are using Babel right

361
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:08,420
most of us most of us want to be using

362
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:09,920
Babel if we're not already using Babel

363
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:12,170
so introducing another plugin that

364
00:14:12,170 --> 00:14:13,459
transforms your JSX

365
00:14:13,459 --> 00:14:19,310
typically not not a problem so if you

366
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:22,370
are holding out still because of JSX I

367
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:25,220
suggest one everyone that I know that

368
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:28,069
writes react eventually ends up on jsx

369
00:14:28,069 --> 00:14:29,779
with one exception but he's kind of

370
00:14:29,779 --> 00:14:34,250
weird so it's cool but just give it a

371
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:36,709
shot and if you really really don't like

372
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:38,470
it it's actually pretty easy to write

373
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:40,670
react without JSX

374
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:42,980
it kind of sucks because it's like not

375
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:44,899
many tutorials because again most people

376
00:14:44,899 --> 00:14:46,009
end up writing JSX

377
00:14:46,009 --> 00:14:49,130
but if you want to learn then come talk

378
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:50,149
to me we can definitely figure it out

379
00:14:50,149 --> 00:14:52,370
together and the other thing I like

380
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:54,350
about JSX is it's very declarative right

381
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:56,779
you're declaring I want my markup to

382
00:14:56,779 --> 00:14:57,840
look like this

383
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,790
and I that also very appealing to me

384
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:01,830
like I much as possible I think

385
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:03,810
declarative code is easier to read

386
00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:05,880
easier to reason about easier to

387
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:08,850
maintain all those things which in my

388
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:11,940
opinion make it empirically better that

389
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:16,620
doesn't really make sense anyway so last

390
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:19,070
thing has actually had written this I

391
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:21,330
but I didn't want to bring it to Iceland

392
00:15:21,330 --> 00:15:22,020
so I didn't

393
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:24,000
so there's another library called react

394
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,790
hardware that you can write react for

395
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:29,450
the Arduino which is like right like

396
00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:32,760
mind blown but you can actually like you

397
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,890
know turn on the breadboard and you know

398
00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:37,050
blink the lights all that using just

399
00:15:37,050 --> 00:15:39,540
react which is just fascinating to me

400
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:40,860
that someone took the time to do this

401
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:44,250
but it was super fun to write so all of

402
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:46,589
this to say is it's really really cool

403
00:15:46,589 --> 00:15:49,260
stuff going on with react and I invite

404
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:52,680
you to give it a shot so I'm going to

405
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:53,640
move to the second part of my

406
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:57,300
presentation and we're going to now go

407
00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:00,870
into the react Dom so where are you from

408
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:03,350
feel free to tweet that out

409
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:07,100
hopefully my server still running

410
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:09,450
so yeah react Dom is most prevalent

411
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:11,970
today that's kind of what react was

412
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:13,140
created for and everything else is kind

413
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:15,330
of trying to capture that magic that we

414
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:18,900
already have with react it's being used

415
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:21,690
at Netflix it's being used at reddit

416
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:25,440
Facebook Google Mozilla everyone is

417
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,940
using it to build interfaces and it's

418
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:29,250
pretty pretty sweet yeah I have here my

419
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:31,620
notes it's scales which i think is just

420
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:33,120
like the most thing to say I

421
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,800
don't even know what that means but it

422
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:40,050
scales what that might mean is that it's

423
00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:42,780
really easy to use in teens because you

424
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:44,339
can treat components like I write a

425
00:16:44,339 --> 00:16:46,170
component and you write a component and

426
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:48,030
they can kind of be black boxes to each

427
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:50,490
other with the way that react works they

428
00:16:50,490 --> 00:16:52,380
kind of expose this like API is like

429
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:54,120
okay I expect you to give me these

430
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,709
things and I'm going to do things with

431
00:16:55,709 --> 00:16:57,660
them right and there's secret things you

432
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:58,860
don't you don't get to know what it does

433
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:00,810
right which is can you I mean you can

434
00:17:00,810 --> 00:17:01,980
look at the code but you don't have to

435
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:04,709
know what it does and I think that's

436
00:17:04,709 --> 00:17:06,750
that's pretty awesome that you can treat

437
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:08,370
your

438
00:17:08,370 --> 00:17:12,100
colles coat is as a block box that can

439
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:13,539
be scary too if you don't trust your

440
00:17:13,539 --> 00:17:16,240
colleague but then you have other

441
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:20,140
problems I suppose so let's talk about

442
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:24,309
like what this might look like so this

443
00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:27,610
is kind of a typical react app that you

444
00:17:27,610 --> 00:17:30,190
might see right that you have these

445
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:32,380
interior like drop down components and

446
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:34,720
then you have like an author panel I

447
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:35,919
don't even know if this is supposed to

448
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:39,640
be a graduate of Google image search but

449
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:41,409
it's it's a component made up of other

450
00:17:41,409 --> 00:17:43,480
components that is then inside of

451
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:44,679
another component which is then inside

452
00:17:44,679 --> 00:17:45,850
another component right so it's just

453
00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:47,409
components inside of components inside

454
00:17:47,409 --> 00:17:49,659
of components but like something you

455
00:17:49,659 --> 00:17:52,210
might notice which is really cool I have

456
00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:53,409
a couple of dropdowns right here and

457
00:17:53,409 --> 00:17:54,940
then I also have a drop down over here

458
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:56,860
or I have like a date picker over here

459
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:58,510
like I write these little components and

460
00:17:58,510 --> 00:17:59,770
then I'm able to just use them across

461
00:17:59,770 --> 00:18:03,580
the site my favorite example of that is

462
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:05,620
I used to work at reddit and you can

463
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:08,080
think about a reddit post right and a

464
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,880
reddit post you can give gold you can

465
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,620
upvote you can down vote you can report

466
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:13,740
to the admins you can give a permalink

467
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:15,669
there's all these different behaviors

468
00:18:15,669 --> 00:18:17,350
that are commonly associated with posts

469
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:18,370
no matter where you put them right it

470
00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:19,929
could be embedded into another page it

471
00:18:19,929 --> 00:18:22,059
could be on the comet view it could be

472
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:24,280
on the home page it could be on a

473
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:26,200
subreddit view all these different pages

474
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:30,250
that display the same component well

475
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:31,929
it's kind of annoying to have to either

476
00:18:31,929 --> 00:18:34,929
copy and paste these you know the

477
00:18:34,929 --> 00:18:36,280
JavaScript associated with these all

478
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:37,659
these behaviors that also have to come

479
00:18:37,659 --> 00:18:39,220
with the markup and all the styling and

480
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:40,960
all that kind of things the nice thing

481
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:43,600
about react is I write this drop-down or

482
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,549
this reddit post and I'm able to embed

483
00:18:45,549 --> 00:18:46,929
it in all these different places and it

484
00:18:46,929 --> 00:18:48,669
brings with it all of its styling it

485
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:50,740
brings with it all of its behavior it's

486
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:53,080
very you know dry do not repeat yourself

487
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:56,700
kind of an idea and I think that's a

488
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:58,600
pretty awesome in fact what you're

489
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,510
seeing here is another presentation

490
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:02,890
crazy thing that I decided to write oh

491
00:19:02,890 --> 00:19:05,320
you can't see that what there I swear

492
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:11,480
there are

493
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:13,750
see there are things down here people

494
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:16,660
are tweeting we're just going to leave

495
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:20,860
it like this right this is readable no

496
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:22,960
okay well I promise there's a whole row

497
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,190
and they're very pretty and I can see

498
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:27,190
them it's mostly Iceland let's see it

499
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:30,970
was like seven Iceland tweets five us

500
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:36,970
ones three world ones and yeah that's it

501
00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:37,600
oh yeah

502
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,850
so tweet some more than you can say

503
00:19:39,850 --> 00:19:43,320
it'll make another row on top of it

504
00:19:43,330 --> 00:19:46,810
props down action up so this is really

505
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:49,420
what kept me in react the idea with

506
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:52,530
react is this idea of one-way data flow

507
00:19:52,530 --> 00:19:56,650
which is this amazing idea of parents

508
00:19:56,650 --> 00:19:59,320
passed down pieces of data and callbacks

509
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:01,000
to the children and the children can

510
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,500
read them and they can call the

511
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,990
functions but they can't actually modify

512
00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:06,610
them they're read-only they're mutable

513
00:20:06,610 --> 00:20:09,520
to the child which means that if there

514
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:12,100
is a problem with that state it means

515
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:13,480
the child didn't muck with it because a

516
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,760
child simply cannot muck with it and

517
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:18,460
that really reduces your surface area

518
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:21,340
for bugs and I hope you're kind of

519
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:23,350
getting a theme here that react is very

520
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:25,030
maintainable it's very easy to track

521
00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:27,010
down these bugs and I think it's a

522
00:20:27,010 --> 00:20:30,610
really compelling reason to use react so

523
00:20:30,610 --> 00:20:32,560
you pass down these props but when the

524
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:34,240
child has like some sort of event right

525
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,590
like if say it's that date picker that

526
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:36,850
we were just looking at it needs to

527
00:20:36,850 --> 00:20:39,070
inform the parent container that

528
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:39,970
something happened

529
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:41,710
well the parent just passes down an up

530
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:44,440
callback the child says hey something

531
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:46,780
happened here's the data I got you deal

532
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:48,790
with it right and then it passes that

533
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:51,580
data but back up to the to the parent

534
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:53,860
and the parent is able to modify its own

535
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:55,360
data so if there's any problem with that

536
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:58,060
modified data the parent did it right

537
00:20:58,060 --> 00:21:00,640
because only the parent can do it which

538
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:06,010
I also think is pretty compelling it's C

539
00:21:06,010 --> 00:21:08,230
I know what I can do I can just unmask

540
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:11,870
amaizing

541
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:16,330
there you go now you can see it another

542
00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:18,250
favorite part favorite part I have about

543
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:20,440
react is that the best practices for

544
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:23,020
react are usually just JavaScript best

545
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:25,450
practices and I think this is kind of a

546
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:26,799
bold assertion to make because I'm in

547
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:29,620
subtly implying kind of on purpose that

548
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:30,940
that's not necessarily true of other

549
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:34,990
frameworks but the nice thing about

550
00:21:34,990 --> 00:21:37,450
reactors it's knowable you can know

551
00:21:37,450 --> 00:21:39,760
everything about react there's just it's

552
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:42,400
not very big in terms of how many

553
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,010
methods there are I wish I probably

554
00:21:45,010 --> 00:21:46,299
should have gone and counted but they're

555
00:21:46,299 --> 00:21:47,679
not very many you can know the entire

556
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:49,990
API whereas is there anyone here

557
00:21:49,990 --> 00:21:51,790
comfortable in deserting they used the

558
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:57,220
entire jQuery API in an app no hands no

559
00:21:57,220 --> 00:22:00,309
hands okay no Liars in the room because

560
00:22:00,309 --> 00:22:03,010
it's impossible there's like 300 methods

561
00:22:03,010 --> 00:22:04,990
right and that do wildly different

562
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:07,660
things and so that's why I feel

563
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:09,400
comfortable and asserting that because

564
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,049
there's such a small API there's not a

565
00:22:11,049 --> 00:22:13,090
whole lot to react and so most of the

566
00:22:13,090 --> 00:22:14,020
stuff that you're doing on the

567
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:15,640
day-to-day is just writing raw

568
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,410
JavaScript which i think is also pretty

569
00:22:17,410 --> 00:22:21,070
pretty damn compelling I talked about

570
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:23,770
this already react is definitely more

571
00:22:23,770 --> 00:22:25,360
declarative you declare the way you want

572
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,760
your components to work we are kind of

573
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:30,419
posting those those blanks for you and

574
00:22:30,419 --> 00:22:33,750
reactors community whoo look at that

575
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:36,120
hold on we're going to take a picture

576
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:39,820
wait where is there it is that is

577
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:42,190
getting tweeted

578
00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:44,980
so I was trying to find like a picture

579
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:48,970
from your act calm save image as that's

580
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:51,000
embarrassing

581
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,250
okay so react his community

582
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:56,590
and I was trying to find a picture of

583
00:22:56,590 --> 00:22:59,620
react comp and I couldn't find it so I

584
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:02,710
decided to take one of you all react is

585
00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:04,330
a great community and the other thing

586
00:23:04,330 --> 00:23:05,860
that's reactors community is this is a

587
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:07,780
webcam component that I did not program

588
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:12,160
but stole from NPM thank you 8m p.m. and

589
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:14,140
it had everything built-in like it I

590
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:15,520
took that screenshot and have to do

591
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,690
anything that was already built in so

592
00:23:16,690 --> 00:23:19,660
there's also a community of people that

593
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:24,180
will help you out so yeah go team and

594
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:27,280
react as a fad absolutely like anyone

595
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,900
that's not telling you that is totally

596
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:32,740
deluding themselves like obviously its

597
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:34,660
new shiny right now we had new shiny

598
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:37,320
angular a couple years ago and we had

599
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:40,570
backbone knockout quit anyone still

600
00:23:40,570 --> 00:23:47,530
writing quit I'm sorry just but I think

601
00:23:47,530 --> 00:23:49,360
the lessons that we're taking here from

602
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,640
react are going to to live with us for a

603
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:55,420
long time this idea of one-way dataflow

604
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:58,050
is going to live with us for a long time

605
00:23:58,050 --> 00:23:59,860
we're going to take a lot of these

606
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:01,450
lessons and apply them to our future

607
00:24:01,450 --> 00:24:02,830
frameworks or to our future user

608
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:05,800
interfaces and so in that sense writing

609
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:07,480
react today I think is still a good

610
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:08,950
thing because you're learning good

611
00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:11,410
practices of how to write maintainable

612
00:24:11,410 --> 00:24:15,190
large apps in production all those sort

613
00:24:15,190 --> 00:24:22,170
of great things so I have my yet most

614
00:24:22,170 --> 00:24:24,250
probably terrible idea

615
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:26,230
for a demo but we're going to do right

616
00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:31,120
now all right so I got to open QuickTime

617
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:35,350
here

618
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:38,509
I had it open didn't I nope okay

619
00:24:38,509 --> 00:24:50,179
QuickTime and new movie recording yeah

620
00:24:50,179 --> 00:24:54,019
maybe cool alright so this is also

621
00:24:54,019 --> 00:24:58,489
written in react this is written by RS

622
00:24:58,489 --> 00:25:02,840
using a technology called that's not

623
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:07,669
what I wanted to do called a frame and

624
00:25:07,669 --> 00:25:10,840
look at that look at those pretty people

625
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:17,049
alright and then just put this into

626
00:25:17,049 --> 00:25:23,720
Google glass right here alright so if

627
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:25,249
you let's try refreshing this page

628
00:25:25,249 --> 00:25:29,519
actually

629
00:25:29,529 --> 00:25:33,700
so a frame is a really cool tech that I

630
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:36,350
believe live was her name was talking

631
00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:38,629
about this morning it's a technology

632
00:25:38,629 --> 00:25:40,909
from our good friends at Mozilla that

633
00:25:40,909 --> 00:25:41,929
they're going to save the world from

634
00:25:41,929 --> 00:25:45,889
everyone there we go so if you tweet

635
00:25:45,889 --> 00:25:49,239
that should come up there I think I

636
00:25:49,239 --> 00:25:54,430
would imagine that would be

637
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:56,580
yeah it looks like it's still working so

638
00:25:56,580 --> 00:26:00,540
I know absolutely nothing about 3d

639
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:03,600
programming like zero things but I was

640
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:04,920
able to write something in virtual

641
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:06,480
reality where it would take your picture

642
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:07,920
off of things you were tweeting and put

643
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:09,150
it in virtual reality like that is

644
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:12,540
stupid easy this is only like 100 lines

645
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:14,730
of code or something like that and I was

646
00:26:14,730 --> 00:26:17,540
able to do that just using technology

647
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:19,470
using the same things that I already

648
00:26:19,470 --> 00:26:22,230
knew about writing react for a sign-up

649
00:26:22,230 --> 00:26:23,940
process on Netflix I was able to apply

650
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:25,680
those same lessons and apply them into

651
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:28,880
3d so I think it's pretty cool and

652
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:31,440
pretty compelling I don't think this is

653
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,810
letting people tweet which is

654
00:26:33,810 --> 00:26:43,170
disappointing but nonetheless I promise

655
00:26:43,170 --> 00:26:47,550
you it does actually work let's see if I

656
00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:51,120
can actually just do it on here I'm

657
00:26:51,120 --> 00:27:00,840
almost out of time anyway so

658
00:27:00,850 --> 00:27:03,010
there we go Oh looks like someone is

659
00:27:03,010 --> 00:27:06,970
tweeting so yes we have to learn once

660
00:27:06,970 --> 00:27:09,400
right anywhere it is a real thing if you

661
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:12,670
take the time to learn react and I think

662
00:27:12,670 --> 00:27:14,260
these lessons that were you learning now

663
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:16,090
with react community are going to

664
00:27:16,090 --> 00:27:17,680
service into writing user interfaces for
