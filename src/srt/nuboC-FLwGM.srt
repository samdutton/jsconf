[Music]

2
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:13,320
hello hi thank you so much for that

3
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:17,010
amazing introduction so hey everyone my

4
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:19,199
name is Shirley and this is Letty and

5
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:21,510
we're to data visualization freelancers

6
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:25,230
from Amsterdam in San Francisco and for

7
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:27,210
the last 10 months we've been working on

8
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:29,400
a project called data sketches where we

9
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:32,099
take a topic each month and visualize it

10
00:00:32,099 --> 00:00:38,040
by around the end of the month so let's

11
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:41,010
start from the very beginning Nani and I

12
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:43,410
actually met online in a private data

13
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:46,680
visualization slag and the fall of 2015

14
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,719
and didn't actually meet each other in

15
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:52,230
person until open viscom in Boston last

16
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:55,260
year where we had the pleasure of giving

17
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:58,050
talks separately and hang out for three

18
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:00,270
whole days where we got along really

19
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:03,960
well so that when two months later Nadi

20
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:06,900
put up her as VG tutorials accompanying

21
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:10,500
her talks I give them into them with

22
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:14,400
vigor and as I started talking to Nadi

23
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,770
with questions about her tutorials

24
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:19,020
restarted somehow commiserating around

25
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:22,200
the fact that we really hadn't completed

26
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,689
as many data visualization side projects

27
00:01:24,689 --> 00:01:27,090
as we were hoping for in the past year

28
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:31,470
and that was when I had an idea and I

29
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:33,840
asked Nani fully expecting to be

30
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,540
rejected do you want to collaborate with

31
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:41,880
me and then she said yes and that's how

32
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:45,930
they discussed started so in the

33
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:48,000
following week we fear doubt that we

34
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,070
both like the idea where we would create

35
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:52,590
a visualization around a specific topic

36
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:55,500
each month and do that for a year to see

37
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,630
how two people would create two

38
00:01:57,630 --> 00:01:59,880
visualizations starting from the same

39
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:02,399
seed the topic and then diverging into

40
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:03,780
different paths based on our own

41
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:06,659
interest in history well besides sharing

42
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:08,520
the end result we also want to write

43
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,530
about the creation process

44
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:12,030
and we split this up into the three

45
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:14,280
pillars that we find most important data

46
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:17,790
sketches and coding and initially we

47
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:19,650
thought we could pull data sketches off

48
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:22,440
with about five to six hours a week but

49
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,510
yeah as usual real life doesn't really

50
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:26,910
care about your plans especially coding

51
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:30,270
plans so since starting in July 2016

52
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:32,940
we've clocked many many hours into

53
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:34,910
creating a visualization each month and

54
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:37,500
during this talk we'd like to take you

55
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:38,940
through some of the lessons that we

56
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:41,250
learned the challenges that we face now

57
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:43,230
we can tackle them and the insights that

58
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:46,800
we gathered along the way so let's start

59
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,680
with the data we often get asked this

60
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,290
question do you get your idea you get

61
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:54,120
your data first and then come up with

62
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,730
the idea or do you get your ideas first

63
00:02:56,730 --> 00:03:00,750
and for the two of us the answer is

64
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:05,310
always always idea first so for example

65
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:07,530
for our November data sketches I

66
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:10,500
visualized every single line in the

67
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:17,100
musical called Hamilton and built a tool

68
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:19,110
where I can filter by any set of

69
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:21,350
characters their conversations and

70
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:24,780
phrases and then be able to dig into all

71
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:26,790
of the lyrics that were left in the

72
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:30,720
remaining song and the question I

73
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,390
started with was this how do the

74
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:35,550
relationship change between the

75
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:38,900
characters as a musical progresses and

76
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:41,670
what are the recurring phrases and who

77
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:45,570
are they associated with now as you can

78
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:47,760
probably imagine this data was not

79
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:51,600
available online anywhere so I had to go

80
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:54,120
through each of those lyrics noting

81
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,519
every single time a phrase occurred

82
00:03:56,519 --> 00:04:00,989
across more than one song group those

83
00:04:00,989 --> 00:04:04,709
phrases into themes and then go through

84
00:04:04,709 --> 00:04:06,660
the lyrics again entering them into the

85
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:09,060
computer and associating them with the

86
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:11,850
right song and line number and gene

87
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:13,440
exact same thing for the characters and

88
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:16,260
conversations and then I wrote a script

89
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:18,450
to aggregate those characters in themes

90
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:20,520
by their song and line number to get my

91
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:22,030
final data set

92
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:27,550
in a more extreme example I asked

93
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:30,670
October decided that I wanted to put

94
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:35,200
emojis on mr. and mrs. Obama faces so I

95
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:40,990
have here every YouTube video um that

96
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:43,180
you can dig through of their late-night

97
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:46,300
talk show appearances and here you can

98
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:49,360
go home through each of the scenes click

99
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:54,100
on any of the frames and see their faces

100
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:58,660
on Oh the images are not loading but if

101
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:00,340
they load it then you can see the faces

102
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:04,960
um oh no oh there we go yeah so emojis

103
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,100
on their faces

104
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:09,060
[Music]

105
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:12,220
thank you this skill brings me joy I did

106
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:13,780
this for the election because it was

107
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:14,560
bumming me out

108
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:20,230
and then this still brings me joy um so

109
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:22,480
the idea really started with when I was

110
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,160
talking to one of our friends Eric and

111
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,970
he said wouldn't it be cool if you could

112
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:30,340
run facial detection on the videos and

113
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:32,950
correlate their emotions with what

114
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:35,350
they're saying and I was like hey Eric

115
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:38,320
you realize I only have one month to do

116
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,890
this and then I was like you know what

117
00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:42,690
Eric

118
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:47,350
challenge accepted so to do this I had

119
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:49,300
to manually first gather all of the late

120
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:52,260
night talk show appearances also by NVB

121
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:54,880
get their corresponding YouTube videos

122
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:59,190
also their hosts channels use a node

123
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:01,690
package to download all the videos and

124
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:03,850
their captions so that I can get the

125
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:06,130
timestamps from the closed captions to

126
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:09,010
take a screenshot every time somebody

127
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:11,740
talks and then upload them to the Google

128
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:15,010
vision API which is a really fun API

129
00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:17,380
that gives me like the bounds of their

130
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:19,960
faces as well as data about like whether

131
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:22,000
or not each of these people were like

132
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,210
happy or angry or sad or was wearing a

133
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:28,990
hat and and gave that data back to me in

134
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:30,789
a JSON format back then I cleared the

135
00:06:30,789 --> 00:06:32,349
write a script to aggragate with the

136
00:06:32,349 --> 00:06:38,490
caption data to get my final data set

137
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:41,450
[Laughter]

138
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:45,450
it would be too kind of extreme examples

139
00:06:45,450 --> 00:06:48,360
taught me was that if I have a curiosity

140
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:52,050
and curiosity that I can get the data is

141
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:53,970
out there somehow whether I have to go

142
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:56,550
manually gather them or write a bunch of

143
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:58,590
automated scripts which by the way I

144
00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:00,330
found that there is like a new library

145
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:03,060
for anything I can imagine Under the Sun

146
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:06,240
as long as I play responsibly and

147
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,930
legally so thankfully not every month

148
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:11,820
this is data intensive I surely just

149
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:13,740
showed us this are more normal months

150
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:15,690
and with places you can find data online

151
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:19,350
for example for August I decided to dive

152
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:20,880
into the Olympics well our theme with

153
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:21,930
the Olympics because it is rather

154
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:24,660
obvious and we are both expense and I

155
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:27,270
wanted to visualize all 5,000 gold medal

156
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:28,830
winners since the very first Olympic

157
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:31,710
Games in 1896 so each of these circles

158
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:33,870
is a group of similar sports like water

159
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:36,600
sports or ball sports and then each of

160
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:39,030
the slices or feathers within a circle

161
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:41,580
is one sport Langguth Olympics and then

162
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:43,290
we have the first version going out or

163
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:47,040
2016 the reddish background are female

164
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,900
events the blueish background are male

165
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:52,110
events and finally the color of each of

166
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:54,870
these medals is the confidence in which

167
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:56,910
the country lies that won the medal so

168
00:07:56,910 --> 00:07:59,880
for example Europe is blue and America's

169
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,100
is red and so on we can see that at the

170
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:04,050
very first editions there were no female

171
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:06,150
ethics events but we've been catching up

172
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:09,000
since then thankfully and I found the

173
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,430
data set for this piece from two

174
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:13,470
articles published by the Guardian for

175
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:15,620
the 2012 Games in London

176
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,880
however after getting a rough shape of

177
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,710
my visual on the screen I noticed some

178
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:21,360
very obvious medals from missing from

179
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,750
2012 like hockey so suddenly my

180
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:26,370
confidence in his dataset dropped

181
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:30,030
drastically and I had to get a sense of

182
00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:33,030
the actual accuracy of his dataset but I

183
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:34,740
didn't want to have to manually go

184
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:38,370
through all 5,000 medals myself manually

185
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:39,630
although I'm still wondering if surely

186
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:41,690
it would not have

187
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:44,720
so I found a proxy instead and on

188
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,759
Wikipedia I could find a number of

189
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:48,259
events that occurred for each of the

190
00:08:48,259 --> 00:08:50,389
editions and I could compare that to the

191
00:08:50,389 --> 00:08:52,009
number of gold medals I had in my data

192
00:08:52,009 --> 00:08:53,930
set and they proposed the discrepancy I

193
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:55,610
dug deeper to figure out where and why

194
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:58,069
and that's how I found out that for some

195
00:08:58,069 --> 00:09:00,769
of the years the horses were also in the

196
00:09:00,769 --> 00:09:02,779
dataset winning gold which makes for an

197
00:09:02,779 --> 00:09:04,850
interesting read assembly see princess

198
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:06,920
and sissy and lady Mirka as women

199
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:10,069
winning gold in the Olympics well

200
00:09:10,069 --> 00:09:12,259
finally I figured out each discrepancy

201
00:09:12,259 --> 00:09:14,600
and made adjustments to my data to get

202
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,189
it to the point where I trusted it again

203
00:09:16,189 --> 00:09:18,920
and my lesson here was that even coming

204
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,329
from such a respectable source as the

205
00:09:20,329 --> 00:09:22,430
Guardian I really need to get a sense of

206
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:24,199
accuracy and completeness of my data

207
00:09:24,199 --> 00:09:26,240
because missing data can be harder to

208
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,399
find them wrong data you don't always

209
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:30,470
have to check every value but think

210
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:32,300
about taking sums and counts and

211
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:34,490
averages and comparing these two plain

212
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:36,800
common sense or even better at different

213
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:41,360
data source so many people jump straight

214
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,610
from data as a final visual but take

215
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:45,680
some time and sit back and sketch out

216
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,410
your ideas instead we filled many pages

217
00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:50,089
of our notebooks in starting because

218
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:52,130
sketching helps us think and layout

219
00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:55,189
ideas beforehand and my sketches are

220
00:09:55,189 --> 00:09:57,829
often very simple and I really only

221
00:09:57,829 --> 00:09:59,930
focus on the main abstract shapes then I

222
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:02,300
want to fit my data into like colors and

223
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:05,029
layout and details these are things I

224
00:10:05,029 --> 00:10:07,100
only vaguely think about but don't act

225
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:09,470
on until I have the data on my screen

226
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:11,779
there's just no use to think about these

227
00:10:11,779 --> 00:10:13,610
things until I figured out that the data

228
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:15,199
works once I've morphed it into the

229
00:10:15,199 --> 00:10:17,509
final shape and for the Olympics for

230
00:10:17,509 --> 00:10:19,009
example I had this idea of feathers

231
00:10:19,009 --> 00:10:21,230
placing more emphasis on the recent

232
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:23,959
additions however I had no idea that

233
00:10:23,959 --> 00:10:25,730
would look a white when I finally placed

234
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:27,680
all 5,000 medals together

235
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,809
I have to see the general shape woodwork

236
00:10:29,809 --> 00:10:32,870
before moving on so I started laying out

237
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:35,029
the feathers and it took a few steps but

238
00:10:35,029 --> 00:10:37,009
if I eventually I came to the point

239
00:10:37,009 --> 00:10:39,139
where I saw that luckily it did show

240
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:41,839
potential with the actual data but

241
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:44,180
sometimes there is no use of start

242
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:45,680
sketching on paper although I will say

243
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:48,800
that forever but networks an exception

244
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,440
for me and for October my

245
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,990
thing to dive into was royalty versus

246
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:56,879
the Obamas and I've always been

247
00:10:56,879 --> 00:10:58,769
intrigued by how into marriage the

248
00:10:58,769 --> 00:11:00,389
Royals really are you know are they old

249
00:11:00,389 --> 00:11:03,240
cousins twice removed and luckily I

250
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:05,519
found a genealogy data set that

251
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:07,949
contained a gigantic family tree as a

252
00:11:07,949 --> 00:11:11,310
European royal houses it was from 1992

253
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:13,290
so I have to add one or two more

254
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:14,819
generations in the main line of

255
00:11:14,819 --> 00:11:16,649
succession which was a fun night on

256
00:11:16,649 --> 00:11:21,180
Wikipedia but so here we have the family

257
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:24,449
three or 3,000 people and the current

258
00:11:24,449 --> 00:11:26,250
royal leaders are the big circles and

259
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:28,439
everybody is connected to their parents

260
00:11:28,439 --> 00:11:30,629
their partner and their children and to

261
00:11:30,629 --> 00:11:32,009
highlight the interconnections you can

262
00:11:32,009 --> 00:11:34,560
actually hover over anybody and see how

263
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,060
far their six degrees of separation

264
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:39,209
would lead into the web and you can also

265
00:11:39,209 --> 00:11:42,300
click on anybody see if that works here

266
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:45,480
and anybody else to see the shortest

267
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,279
path between these two people because

268
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:51,120
the entire web is connected well but

269
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,649
when I started out with this data set I

270
00:11:52,649 --> 00:11:54,600
had no idea what it contained

271
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,670
so I just put everybody on the page

272
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:58,620
using the most basic network settings

273
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:01,980
and this happened an explosion of points

274
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:04,350
on lines going out of my screen well

275
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:07,199
let's reign in gravity bit then but that

276
00:12:07,199 --> 00:12:10,230
left me with a useless hairball well

277
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:12,380
maybe I could color them by year first

278
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:16,019
no not helping but luckily in decreased

279
00:12:16,019 --> 00:12:17,970
version while the newest version you can

280
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:20,610
have gravity depend on variables so I

281
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:22,920
pulled the web apart by year of birth as

282
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:25,649
well that was better but it was still a

283
00:12:25,649 --> 00:12:28,319
rather unentitled bundle and at this

284
00:12:28,319 --> 00:12:30,509
point I'd already invested several hours

285
00:12:30,509 --> 00:12:32,339
into playing with the network settings

286
00:12:32,339 --> 00:12:33,600
playing with the different kinds of

287
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,120
connection adjusting my data and I was

288
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,579
really ready to just give up but you

289
00:12:38,579 --> 00:12:40,709
know I gave it one last time and this

290
00:12:40,709 --> 00:12:42,870
time I decided to focus on the current

291
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:45,089
Royal leaders so I please these in a

292
00:12:45,089 --> 00:12:47,069
line and then I let the vertebral

293
00:12:47,069 --> 00:12:49,379
gravity depend on how you know which of

294
00:12:49,379 --> 00:12:51,029
these recurrent royal leaders you were

295
00:12:51,029 --> 00:12:53,579
most closely related to and that's when

296
00:12:53,579 --> 00:12:56,639
I finally saw it insight for example

297
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:58,170
that the Queen of Denmark over here is

298
00:12:58,170 --> 00:13:00,480
actually very central to the web whereas

299
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,069
the princes monocle line here is

300
00:13:02,069 --> 00:13:03,630
separated from the rest more than two

301
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:04,180
hundred year

302
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:07,120
ago and it was only around this time

303
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,770
that I finally started thinking about

304
00:13:08,770 --> 00:13:11,010
the more of the design aspects and

305
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:12,910
networks often reminds me of

306
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:14,980
constellations and with my astronomy

307
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:17,110
background I have a bias rolling space

308
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:20,640
so I turned it into a starry night and

309
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:23,140
the thing is I could have never designed

310
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:25,690
this visualization beforehand I had to

311
00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:28,180
go hand in hand the actual data and

312
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:30,520
apply my design choices to all of the

313
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:32,890
data simultaneously to see if the

314
00:13:32,890 --> 00:13:35,370
results are both engaging and insightful

315
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:37,810
so now you gave us a really great

316
00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:41,020
example of when we land on the right

317
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:43,089
visualization form early on in our

318
00:13:43,089 --> 00:13:46,240
process but that's not always the case

319
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,490
so for our March data schedules we had

320
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:50,290
the incredible opportunity to work with

321
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:51,850
the Google News lab and their search

322
00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:55,270
data dating back to 2004 and with access

323
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:57,730
to this incredible amount of data I

324
00:13:57,730 --> 00:13:59,649
wanted to take a look at what countries

325
00:13:59,649 --> 00:14:02,980
searched for around the world for travel

326
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:08,950
across each different seasons and for a

327
00:14:08,950 --> 00:14:12,010
particular country I wanted to be able

328
00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:14,709
to see for each of those topics what are

329
00:14:14,709 --> 00:14:16,420
the search interests across the years

330
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:20,110
and their seasonality patterns but to

331
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:23,350
get to this point I first asked what are

332
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:25,240
the top search countries and it turns

333
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,790
out it's Brazil and then I wondered

334
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:31,690
who's searching for Brazil what are the

335
00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:33,279
kind of topics are is being searched for

336
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:35,770
for Brazil and each of those countries

337
00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:38,980
and what are the distributions like

338
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:42,400
across each of the years and then I

339
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,620
wondered can I put search interests in

340
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:46,110
there somehow

341
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:48,520
which did not turn out so well I call

342
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:52,570
this my plunder theory so I took a step

343
00:14:52,570 --> 00:14:55,150
back and I say ok so maybe I can try out

344
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:57,720
circles as each of those topics and show

345
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:00,850
the search interest as a radius of each

346
00:15:00,850 --> 00:15:03,220
circle and for each country searching

347
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:04,060
for that topic

348
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:06,070
I'll have overlapping circles and this

349
00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:07,930
is what it looked like and I thought it

350
00:15:07,930 --> 00:15:09,040
looked pretty ok

351
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,860
it's kind of pretty so then I wondered

352
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:14,470
well I think I noticed that maybe

353
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:16,270
geography plays a part in who's

354
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:17,480
searching for a country

355
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:20,089
topics within the country so maybe I can

356
00:15:20,089 --> 00:15:22,790
try sorting those topics for particular

357
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:25,639
year by distance and that didn't look so

358
00:15:25,639 --> 00:15:27,980
great so then I was like maybe I can

359
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:30,109
just concentrate on one topic across the

360
00:15:30,109 --> 00:15:32,299
years and that looks like maybe it will

361
00:15:32,299 --> 00:15:36,769
lend nicely to a heat map like ha this

362
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:38,209
is not going anywhere

363
00:15:38,209 --> 00:15:41,209
and then but then I remembered that

364
00:15:41,209 --> 00:15:43,759
earlier on in my explorations I had

365
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:45,109
noticed that there's a lot of

366
00:15:45,109 --> 00:15:47,809
seasonality in a lot of the topics so

367
00:15:47,809 --> 00:15:50,329
then I wondered can i filter and group

368
00:15:50,329 --> 00:15:52,549
each of those topics by each of the

369
00:15:52,549 --> 00:15:55,009
seasons and maybe the sounded kind of

370
00:15:55,009 --> 00:15:56,749
promising like maybe I'll be able to get

371
00:15:56,749 --> 00:16:00,529
some insights out of this and nope it

372
00:16:00,529 --> 00:16:03,019
turns out that each of those topics are

373
00:16:03,019 --> 00:16:04,939
searched for across all of the seasons

374
00:16:04,939 --> 00:16:06,949
which meant that each of the graphs

375
00:16:06,949 --> 00:16:10,069
actually looked exactly the same I was

376
00:16:10,069 --> 00:16:12,559
really disappointed but then but then I

377
00:16:12,559 --> 00:16:15,169
remembered by hey the search interests

378
00:16:15,169 --> 00:16:16,819
are different across each of the seasons

379
00:16:16,819 --> 00:16:18,859
which means that if I decides the height

380
00:16:18,859 --> 00:16:20,989
of each of those blogs by the search

381
00:16:20,989 --> 00:16:22,759
interest then I can start getting

382
00:16:22,759 --> 00:16:24,889
insights like this one but the United

383
00:16:24,889 --> 00:16:27,230
States searches for travel more often in

384
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:31,489
the spring than in the fall so finally

385
00:16:31,489 --> 00:16:34,819
finally Tuggle the final visualization

386
00:16:34,819 --> 00:16:37,519
where each of the blog's that represent

387
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:40,609
a topic group by their country and I can

388
00:16:40,609 --> 00:16:42,529
toggle between the seasons and see

389
00:16:42,529 --> 00:16:45,679
insights like for example that Mexico

390
00:16:45,679 --> 00:16:48,079
search interests is low in the summer

391
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:50,239
but the Canada is high and the same is

392
00:16:50,239 --> 00:16:51,769
true for the hotter countries around the

393
00:16:51,769 --> 00:16:53,539
world like the Thailand and the

394
00:16:53,539 --> 00:16:56,989
Philippines but when I toggle to winter

395
00:16:56,989 --> 00:16:59,329
the opposite is true and I can see that

396
00:16:59,329 --> 00:17:01,879
Mexico Peaks where Canada drops and

397
00:17:01,879 --> 00:17:04,130
Thailand and the Philippines have peaked

398
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:11,959
also so the lesson I learned is that

399
00:17:11,959 --> 00:17:14,779
sometimes we don't get the right

400
00:17:14,779 --> 00:17:17,000
visualization for the data on our first

401
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,689
or a second or even third sketch so be

402
00:17:20,689 --> 00:17:23,029
patient and go back and forth with the

403
00:17:23,029 --> 00:17:25,819
sketching code to figure out what works

404
00:17:25,819 --> 00:17:28,010
and more importantly what doesn't work

405
00:17:28,010 --> 00:17:31,070
so we can figure out where to go next

406
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:34,380
so as expected most of our hours are

407
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:36,149
spent on actually getting the data on

408
00:17:36,149 --> 00:17:39,000
the screen and here are some of our may

409
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,149
be less obvious coding lessons for our

410
00:17:42,149 --> 00:17:43,830
very first month the topic was moving

411
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:45,990
and for me it was immediately clear I

412
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:47,370
wanted to do something with the Lord of

413
00:17:47,370 --> 00:17:49,980
the Rings and I found this amazing data

414
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:52,139
set that contained the number of words

415
00:17:52,139 --> 00:17:55,200
spoken by each character in each scene

416
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,630
of all three extended editions of the

417
00:17:57,630 --> 00:18:00,510
lore the Rings and how amazing is that I

418
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:02,880
knew I had to visualize that and I

419
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,340
decided to focus on the troubleshoot

420
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:07,139
member so how much have each member of

421
00:18:07,139 --> 00:18:08,639
the Fellowship spoken at the different

422
00:18:08,639 --> 00:18:11,970
locations that we have on site here well

423
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:14,070
no surprise maybe if Gandalf says the

424
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:16,789
most but my favorite insight was that

425
00:18:16,789 --> 00:18:19,950
Boromir who is really only alive during

426
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:22,019
one movie manages to speak more than

427
00:18:22,019 --> 00:18:25,909
Legolas does in three I didn't know that

428
00:18:25,909 --> 00:18:29,909
anyways here is a sketch of my project

429
00:18:29,909 --> 00:18:32,010
and when I saw it I found that it was

430
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:34,380
very similar looking to a chord diagram

431
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:36,570
so I decided to start from there and

432
00:18:36,570 --> 00:18:38,610
then slowly transform the chord diagram

433
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:41,429
into my sketch and here we have a

434
00:18:41,429 --> 00:18:44,220
typical chord diagram and the most

435
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:45,870
fundamental thing to me was is if I

436
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:47,370
could figure out how to get each inner

437
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:49,620
inner chords to flow towards the center

438
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:51,929
which actually took less time than

439
00:18:51,929 --> 00:18:54,179
anticipated which is very rare for me in

440
00:18:54,179 --> 00:18:57,120
coding but getting rid of the space and

441
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,950
now it was ready to handle the actual

442
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:01,110
Lord of the Rings data in some more

443
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:04,080
appropriate colors well we asked nine

444
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,580
members of the fellowship so I have to

445
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:07,320
make sure the center's end up at the

446
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:09,059
right vertical location but now is

447
00:19:09,059 --> 00:19:12,330
getting very squished so I just pulled

448
00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:15,480
the two halves apart but these chords

449
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:17,340
they are looking kind of unnatural right

450
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:19,710
now and that's when I decided to finally

451
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:22,289
dive into SVG paths and learn how to

452
00:19:22,289 --> 00:19:23,490
make them myself

453
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:27,269
it took a while but it was really an

454
00:19:27,269 --> 00:19:29,279
improvement on these chords how they

455
00:19:29,279 --> 00:19:31,889
looked finally and that's how I sort of

456
00:19:31,889 --> 00:19:33,690
ended up with this new kind of chart

457
00:19:33,690 --> 00:19:36,529
that mutated from the chord diagram and

458
00:19:36,529 --> 00:19:39,029
many people have done the wonderful work

459
00:19:39,029 --> 00:19:41,340
that you can use so even if you are

460
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:43,289
creating something new you don't always

461
00:19:43,289 --> 00:19:44,130
have to start

462
00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:46,470
scratch just pick the thing the life

463
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:48,750
most closely to your design or idea and

464
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:51,059
start adjusting that you know remix was

465
00:19:51,059 --> 00:19:53,429
out there already but sometimes

466
00:19:53,429 --> 00:19:55,950
sometimes we managed to dream up things

467
00:19:55,950 --> 00:19:58,080
are unique enough where there is no base

468
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,780
for us to remix office for that same

469
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:03,630
month of movies I wanted to look at the

470
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:06,360
top summer blockbusters of the past two

471
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:10,289
decades and reimagine them as flowers so

472
00:20:10,289 --> 00:20:12,030
each of the colors represent a different

473
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:14,039
genre and the number and the size and

474
00:20:14,039 --> 00:20:15,840
the number of petals of the flowers

475
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:19,080
correspond to the I am there at IMDb

476
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:22,049
rateing and so we have some really

477
00:20:22,049 --> 00:20:23,700
beautiful ones in here like The Dark

478
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:26,909
Knight Rises and inception and Slumdog

479
00:20:26,909 --> 00:20:29,909
Millionaire but my absolute absolute

480
00:20:29,909 --> 00:20:34,039
favorite is the 1997 Batman and Robin

481
00:20:34,039 --> 00:20:37,530
because it's so teeny-tiny so cute

482
00:20:37,530 --> 00:20:42,030
I think it's so cute and I gotten that

483
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:45,179
uh and we've gotten really great

484
00:20:45,179 --> 00:20:47,700
responses for this and people have asked

485
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:49,470
me how did you make this visualization

486
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:52,409
how long did it take you and the answer

487
00:20:52,409 --> 00:20:53,880
is actually that it's actually really

488
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,679
simple and straightforward and all it

489
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:58,020
takes is a good grasp of the SVG path

490
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:01,740
and in particular the cubic Bezier curve

491
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:06,150
command and so how that works is we

492
00:21:06,150 --> 00:21:08,580
start with a point in this case 0 0 and

493
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:10,440
the way that I like to think about it is

494
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:12,539
that we draw a line from that starting

495
00:21:12,539 --> 00:21:15,440
point to the ending purple point and

496
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:18,419
then we take the blue and green anchor

497
00:21:18,419 --> 00:21:20,760
points and nudge them out until we get

498
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:24,600
the curve that we want we draw a line to

499
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:27,870
line or I draw two lines and then make

500
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:30,950
the same a curve on the other side

501
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:35,250
rotate the petals out and then add in

502
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:42,900
the colors and those it and so really

503
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:44,820
understand the tools that you're using

504
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:47,520
because with that understanding we can

505
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:50,010
really go beyond the prescribed examples

506
00:21:50,010 --> 00:21:51,780
of pre-existing examples that are out

507
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:55,320
there ready and then the particular

508
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:57,870
of all of the tools that we use as a

509
00:21:57,870 --> 00:21:59,370
sheep as is probably our favorite

510
00:21:59,370 --> 00:22:02,910
because with a good grasp of SVG path we

511
00:22:02,910 --> 00:22:06,210
can make any shape that we dream up for

512
00:22:06,210 --> 00:22:08,450
truly truly unique results

513
00:22:08,450 --> 00:22:11,640
so besides SVG paths we've also had a

514
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,740
lot of fun playing with math in the past

515
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:16,410
few months and as my addition to the

516
00:22:16,410 --> 00:22:18,060
collaboration month with Google News lab

517
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:21,120
I decided to dive into translations so

518
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,400
what have other languages translated to

519
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:26,130
English we're going from the most

520
00:22:26,130 --> 00:22:28,950
translated words for 10 chosen languages

521
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:32,100
like German and Dutch and more to the

522
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:35,430
top 10 most translated words down to the

523
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:38,880
similarities between languages and here

524
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,130
each of the lines between two languages

525
00:22:41,130 --> 00:22:43,230
represents one word that these two

526
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:44,790
languages have in common between their

527
00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:48,300
top 10 at first I wanted to replace all

528
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:50,100
of these lines with the actual words

529
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:53,010
that they represent well yeah then I

530
00:22:53,010 --> 00:22:55,080
actually saw it and a complete mess it's

531
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:57,600
way too busy so it took a few iterations

532
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,120
to finally get to this more focused and

533
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:02,220
clear version but one of the most

534
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:04,230
important things here was that these

535
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:07,290
words over here we're all as upright as

536
00:23:07,290 --> 00:23:10,710
possible for readability but that turned

537
00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:13,080
into some convoluted calculations for

538
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:15,360
you to get these text paths which became

539
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,820
glaringly obvious once I click one of

540
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:19,260
these circles which moves it to the

541
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:22,260
center yeah that wasn't quite how you

542
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:25,830
might have expected it to go so I needed

543
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:28,590
to figure out how to fix that and that's

544
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:30,480
where math and rational problem solving

545
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,560
came to the rescue

546
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:33,720
yeah it took a few pages out of my

547
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:36,120
notebook but eventually I figured out

548
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:40,620
how to implement the solution so now if

549
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:42,690
I click any of these languages it is

550
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:45,020
more like somebody would expect it to go

551
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:47,550
but I what I've done is really more of a

552
00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:50,280
hack maybe because once you click one of

553
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:52,890
these circles the words they are faded

554
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:55,380
out and then I immediately replace all

555
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:56,940
of these lines with their final states

556
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:59,250
but I prefer engineered them to their

557
00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:00,870
previous state and then smoothly

558
00:24:00,870 --> 00:24:05,370
transition them to the final state so my

559
00:24:05,370 --> 00:24:07,320
lesson here was I guess I knew it

560
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,860
already but if you are

561
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:11,170
doing something new definitely expect

562
00:24:11,170 --> 00:24:12,640
that it will take time because you are

563
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:15,760
going to encounter struggles and if you

564
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,740
didn't already learn to love math

565
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:20,110
because it is usually your best friend

566
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:21,730
in solving these kinds of visual

567
00:24:21,730 --> 00:24:26,470
problems so thus far we've talked about

568
00:24:26,470 --> 00:24:28,720
the what I like to call the first 80%

569
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:31,120
the data preparation the ideation the

570
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,040
sketching and the visualization is self

571
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:35,830
but there's the rest of the 20% but

572
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:38,710
details that we find really important

573
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:41,950
also so when I started thinking about

574
00:24:41,950 --> 00:24:44,590
the story for Hamilton I knew that I

575
00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:46,630
wanted it to reach a wider audience than

576
00:24:46,630 --> 00:24:48,880
usual and I knew I wanted them to be

577
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,650
engaged enough to keep scrolling down

578
00:24:50,650 --> 00:24:52,990
the screen so the very first thing I did

579
00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:56,020
was on page load there is all of the

580
00:24:56,020 --> 00:24:58,330
dots fly into the center to create the

581
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:01,210
Hamilton logo and as the users start

582
00:25:01,210 --> 00:25:04,830
scrolling down the screen the dots

583
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:09,429
fly apart and then dance around until

584
00:25:09,429 --> 00:25:11,799
they get pulled back in together so that

585
00:25:11,799 --> 00:25:13,929
I can show the reader that he each of

586
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:17,830
these dots are actually Fowler and as

587
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:20,799
the reader Scrolls into the first

588
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:23,980
section of analysis each of these

589
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:26,500
sections are actually corresponding with

590
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:28,900
one of the songs so then I highlight the

591
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:32,380
write corresponding song for them the

592
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:34,690
other thing that I did is that if the

593
00:25:34,690 --> 00:25:37,240
user decides they want to click on one

594
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:43,870
of the songs oh there's no way reduce

595
00:25:43,870 --> 00:25:47,260
no audio okay well believe me when I say

596
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:48,669
that there's a song playing somewhere in

597
00:25:48,669 --> 00:25:51,850
there and so as you can see there's a

598
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:55,059
progress bar that I highlight I'm in the

599
00:25:55,059 --> 00:25:57,400
visualization in the right so that the

600
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:59,590
user can get a sense of where the song

601
00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:01,570
is that's playing that relative to the

602
00:26:01,570 --> 00:26:07,780
rest of the musical another example a

603
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:09,669
smaller example that I want to show you

604
00:26:09,669 --> 00:26:13,980
is that for that same month of travel I

605
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:17,080
have these sections where I animate how

606
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:18,700
to read different sections of the

607
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:20,860
visualizations

608
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:23,950
but I don't start the animations until

609
00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:26,140
the user Scrolls down into the correct

610
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:29,200
section so that no matter how quickly or

611
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,600
slowly they scroll they can always see

612
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,580
the animation from start to beginning

613
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:37,840
and it's really these small attention to

614
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,730
detail and the temps that delight that

615
00:26:39,730 --> 00:26:42,190
really make a piece for me because it

616
00:26:42,190 --> 00:26:44,440
tells the reader that we really care

617
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:47,740
about their experience and even more

618
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:49,179
examples of things you could do with the

619
00:26:49,179 --> 00:26:52,149
light well all slides back to answer

620
00:26:52,149 --> 00:26:55,260
them actually from CSS combs in

621
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:59,380
Melbourne I decided to make I hope if it

622
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:05,110
ever gets to the next page I have to

623
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:06,899
[Music]

624
00:27:06,899 --> 00:27:10,659
there we go yeah right so I didn't have

625
00:27:10,659 --> 00:27:12,279
any Wi-Fi and you know what ten thousand

626
00:27:12,279 --> 00:27:14,260
feet so I couldn't do anything essential

627
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:16,690
and I decided to just create an animated

628
00:27:16,690 --> 00:27:18,970
legend of my visualisation about fantasy

629
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:22,389
books you know for fun and or adding

630
00:27:22,389 --> 00:27:24,820
animated gifs of the most memorable and

631
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:28,210
fun moments in Dragonball Z or having a

632
00:27:28,210 --> 00:27:29,769
hopper with the most detailed

633
00:27:29,769 --> 00:27:31,779
information I had for music nerves in my

634
00:27:31,779 --> 00:27:34,330
December music visual or turning the top

635
00:27:34,330 --> 00:27:37,240
ten songs into tiny vinyls having

636
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:40,149
annotations about sphere appeared weird

637
00:27:40,149 --> 00:27:42,130
and silly events of the Olympic Games

638
00:27:42,130 --> 00:27:44,620
like Henry piers having to stop for

639
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:46,480
ducks in the rowing event but still

640
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:50,110
managing to win gold you know although

641
00:27:50,110 --> 00:27:51,940
getting your data on the screen in such

642
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:53,889
a manner as to make it insightful is key

643
00:27:53,889 --> 00:27:56,200
it's the extra things to add like

644
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:58,720
animations annotations we're at Legends

645
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,730
gifts and more that will make it unique

646
00:28:00,730 --> 00:28:03,130
and special and even more of a delight

647
00:28:03,130 --> 00:28:05,679
to investigate so take some time to

648
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:08,710
think about these aspects as well so

649
00:28:08,710 --> 00:28:11,409
finally finally we get to the salsa or

650
00:28:11,409 --> 00:28:13,929
what I like to call the best stuff so

651
00:28:13,929 --> 00:28:16,179
when Maddie and I started talking about

652
00:28:16,179 --> 00:28:18,460
this project but we really weren't

653
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:20,860
expecting the kind of response we got we

654
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:22,419
thought that if we could just have fun

655
00:28:22,419 --> 00:28:24,190
and maybe you learn some things and if

656
00:28:24,190 --> 00:28:26,230
our friends enjoyed it then that'd be

657
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:28,059
enough and that'd be really cool but

658
00:28:28,059 --> 00:28:29,620
instead we've gotten them the most

659
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:32,289
amazing feedback both about our

660
00:28:32,289 --> 00:28:33,770
visualizations and the

661
00:28:33,770 --> 00:28:36,110
value of our write-up and we've had the

662
00:28:36,110 --> 00:28:38,080
opportunity to meet some amazing

663
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:40,630
credible people and talk to them and

664
00:28:40,630 --> 00:28:43,730
even gain an unexpectedly great

665
00:28:43,730 --> 00:28:47,900
friendship out of all of this but when

666
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:49,610
we really sat back to think about the

667
00:28:49,610 --> 00:28:52,040
transferable lessons the most important

668
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:54,440
thing that we agreed on is that if

669
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:57,140
you're about to embark on an ambitious

670
00:28:57,140 --> 00:29:00,650
project grab someone to go along the

671
00:29:00,650 --> 00:29:03,530
ride with you because then you can

672
00:29:03,530 --> 00:29:05,510
motivate and support each other when

673
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:08,480
things get tough and make sure that that

674
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:11,180
someone you grab is if you're not so

675
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:12,950
responsible yourself but it's someone

676
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:15,320
very responsible so that you can keep

677
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:17,510
each other accountable and relatively on

678
00:29:17,510 --> 00:29:20,630
track and because you don't want to eat

679
00:29:20,630 --> 00:29:24,020
let each other down make sure that

680
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:26,600
someone you grab is someone you really

681
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:28,910
respect and hopefully the few who use

682
00:29:28,910 --> 00:29:32,000
mutual you respect each other and but

683
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,770
most importantly that someone is someone

684
00:29:33,770 --> 00:29:36,920
you trust or can grow to trust because

685
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:39,680
that's absolutely essential to giving

686
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:44,630
and receiving feedback and finally can

687
00:29:44,630 --> 00:29:46,700
we talk about to do something ambitious

688
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:49,160
like make a data visualization from

689
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:52,340
scratch every single month and know that

690
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:55,430
it's going to be hard and we've been

691
00:29:55,430 --> 00:29:57,290
creatively drained we see there was a

692
00:29:57,290 --> 00:29:58,700
month where we've been creatively

693
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:00,470
drained and we didn't know how to go on

694
00:30:00,470 --> 00:30:03,610
just remember you learn as you struggle

695
00:30:03,610 --> 00:30:06,110
and the amount that we've learned both

696
00:30:06,110 --> 00:30:07,790
personally and technically have been

697
00:30:07,790 --> 00:30:09,890
absolutely amazing and very much worth

698
00:30:09,890 --> 00:30:12,650
the time so over the last 10 months

699
00:30:12,650 --> 00:30:14,690
we've learned to find data and the

700
00:30:14,690 --> 00:30:17,300
weirdest of places that you can sketch

701
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:18,860
the weed out thinking errors but that

702
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:21,410
you can also sketch with code that SVG

703
00:30:21,410 --> 00:30:24,320
paths and math are amazing but we really

704
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:25,160
knew that of course

705
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:27,560
and that surprisingly small things can

706
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:29,420
Edinson to delight to your audience and

707
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:32,270
we did set out to learn or we can funded

708
00:30:32,270 --> 00:30:34,070
by all these things like Shirley said we

709
00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:35,870
set out to have fun and then that would

710
00:30:35,870 --> 00:30:38,300
definitely succeed it sure it's been

711
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:40,100
tough there were times when we were

712
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:41,570
coding into the night when we would have

713
00:30:41,570 --> 00:30:43,760
rather bench the TV show but it had

714
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,620
opened up new paths and opportunities

715
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:46,340
that we were

716
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:48,380
you're looking for so we hope that

717
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:50,750
you'll join us in our final two months

718
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:53,150
of data munging sketching and coding up

719
00:30:53,150 --> 00:30:55,850
our topics into fun weird and overtly

720
00:30:55,850 --> 00:30:58,250
elaborate visualizations thank you very

721
00:30:58,250 --> 00:31:06,110
much very magic oh how is that Donna

722
00:31:06,110 --> 00:31:07,610
sketched yes
