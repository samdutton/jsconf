1
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:21,630

you

2
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:28,280


3
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:31,150
so I'm from a little team called buddy

4
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:33,060
cloud where an open source project and

5
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:36,160
we have the the big big hairy audacious

6
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:39,090
goal to kind of reinvent messaging we

7
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:41,290
look at looked at the email and we've

8
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:43,600
said like you know this is this protocol

9
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,570
that's been around for the last 30 years

10
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:47,770
let's think about what do we do for the

11
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:52,360
next 30 years so we think that we can

12
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:54,940
really build something better right now

13
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:56,739
we're working with with governments with

14
00:00:56,739 --> 00:00:59,170
with small companies and lots of other

15
00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:01,630
small software teams to kind of change

16
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:03,820
messaging to to let you share files

17
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:06,130
better to shift messages around and this

18
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:08,259
shifting messages around is is really

19
00:01:08,259 --> 00:01:09,340
important if you think about the

20
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:10,990
internet it's it's totally built on

21
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:14,200
these little boxes of you know Facebook

22
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,210
feed or a Twitter feed or this crappy

23
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:18,490
forum software feed when you type stuff

24
00:01:18,490 --> 00:01:20,320
in and it gets pushed out to your

25
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,300
followers you get retweets back or you

26
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:24,070
get likes back or you get flame wars

27
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:26,640
back from the crappy forum software and

28
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,740
we think this can be can be done a lot

29
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:32,500
better but this there's still a lot of

30
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:35,110
incompatibility out there so I got a

31
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:37,150
call from from another South African

32
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:39,130
here and he was like a little bit

33
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:41,080
desperate he he'd arrived with his South

34
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:43,930
African plug saying like hey man do you

35
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:46,180
have a power adapter I have nothing I

36
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:47,920
can't find anybody in the hotel what do

37
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,170
we do and this really reminds me a lot

38
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:52,210
of like how we build our software right

39
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:56,350
now we build software much like a plug

40
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:57,909
you know it plugs in and it works

41
00:01:57,909 --> 00:02:02,979
perfectly with an API but as soon as

42
00:02:02,979 --> 00:02:04,540
there's some other system that comes

43
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:07,840
along we try to like Jimmy it with with

44
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,369
a power adapter you know those ones you

45
00:02:09,369 --> 00:02:10,600
stick in the wall you hope they don't

46
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:13,090
fall out and it sort of hopefully

47
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:14,560
converts to the right voltage and

48
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,269
whatnot and that's kind of the world

49
00:02:16,269 --> 00:02:17,500
we're living in right now it's kind of

50
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:21,430
sucky so we think we can do this a

51
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:22,630
little bit better and just so we're

52
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:24,670
clear about this when I'm talking about

53
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:26,350
api's I'm talking about like systems

54
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:27,489
that interconnect with other systems

55
00:02:27,489 --> 00:02:29,350
very simple when I'm talking about

56
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:30,820
protocols I'm really talking about like

57
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:33,989
a gentlemen's agreement like how does

58
00:02:33,989 --> 00:02:36,010
you know when we when we're driving down

59
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:38,080
the road I'm pretty

60
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,670
much on the right-hand side you passed

61
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:41,170
me on the left and that that kind of

62
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:43,170
works as long as we all follow the rules

63
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:47,200
but why does this matter like why should

64
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,480
we really kit really care about this

65
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,970
well back in the olden days once upon a

66
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:53,290
time we used to build these nice

67
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:54,760
distributed systems and if you scratch

68
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:56,320
underneath the surface of the internet

69
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,720
you still find a few of them around and

70
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,100
they've been around for a hell of a long

71
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:02,470
time for example DNS this is something

72
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:03,850
that was built in the 80s and yet it's

73
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:07,420
so critical to what we're doing and then

74
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:09,660
we've we've thrown a lot of that away

75
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:12,640
we're in the cyst this world where we're

76
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:16,510
being told like how we can and can't

77
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:20,440
build against other peoples api's and

78
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:24,190
what we can do and this this kind of

79
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:26,140
reminds me of the the old days where we

80
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:28,780
had we had the mainframe and you know

81
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:30,610
you had to connect in and both of us

82
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:32,590
remember like you have all your data on

83
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:35,140
a centralized system and you were

84
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:36,970
totally beholden to somebody else on how

85
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:39,250
you would interact with this stuff and

86
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:41,560
then along came the pc and suddenly

87
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,670
everybody could do everything and

88
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:44,080
there's this huge like wave of

89
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,850
innovation that happened in the bedroom

90
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:48,730
in the home in the office everywhere and

91
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:50,500
we've kind of lost that we've lost a lot

92
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,630
of that and what I want to talk to you

93
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:54,070
about today is how do we get some of

94
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:55,450
that back how do we go back to the

95
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:57,100
future and start building and designing

96
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:59,230
these these distributed systems and for

97
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:01,060
that we need protocols because protocols

98
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:03,610
let us agree on a sort of common way on

99
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:07,989
how we can interact and the other super

100
00:04:07,989 --> 00:04:09,730
cool thing about this is when we can

101
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:12,940
push the sort of innovation out so

102
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:15,130
instead of being on a centralized like

103
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:17,169
team in the middle controlling what we

104
00:04:17,169 --> 00:04:18,880
can can't do when we when we can all

105
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,519
work on the edge of the system then the

106
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:23,620
amount of innovation really explodes

107
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:28,390
like the pc exploded so Robert Scoble

108
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:32,320
has this interesting analogy it's called

109
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,150
the ice cream of the internet and we

110
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:38,080
have we have this like super cool step

111
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,720
like things happening right now we have

112
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,250
a phone in our pockets where we can like

113
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:43,810
pull it out and we've got the entire

114
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:45,700
world's information at our fingertips we

115
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:47,350
can take photos and they magically

116
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:48,910
appear on certain websites or you can

117
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:51,220
swipe up and Google now tells you where

118
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:51,849
to go

119
00:04:51,849 --> 00:04:54,129
and we're living in this like super

120
00:04:54,129 --> 00:04:56,709
super cool world of really cool stuff

121
00:04:56,709 --> 00:05:01,479
happening but we're not really asking

122
00:05:01,479 --> 00:05:04,779
ourselves like do we want to be sharing

123
00:05:04,779 --> 00:05:06,429
all of this public this information

124
00:05:06,429 --> 00:05:08,800
publicly now I don't want to stand up in

125
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,929
front of you and say look centralized is

126
00:05:10,929 --> 00:05:13,959
bad decentralized is good I think the

127
00:05:13,959 --> 00:05:15,969
the answer to that is is far more

128
00:05:15,969 --> 00:05:21,399
nuanced the yogi berra says you know

129
00:05:21,399 --> 00:05:22,629
when you come to the fork in the road

130
00:05:22,629 --> 00:05:25,539
you take it centralized definitely

131
00:05:25,539 --> 00:05:26,919
hazard advantages like if you think

132
00:05:26,919 --> 00:05:29,529
about Facebook they came along and say

133
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:31,589
it had to sit there and design a

134
00:05:31,589 --> 00:05:34,240
distributed system distributed is really

135
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,219
hard like when you don't control all the

136
00:05:36,219 --> 00:05:38,709
nodes on the network it's it's a tough

137
00:05:38,709 --> 00:05:40,779
problem to solve like nodes go down how

138
00:05:40,779 --> 00:05:42,279
do you resynchronize messages things

139
00:05:42,279 --> 00:05:46,629
like that so but but we also know that

140
00:05:46,629 --> 00:05:49,269
that decentralized kind of wins in the

141
00:05:49,269 --> 00:05:52,269
long term like the car decentralized

142
00:05:52,269 --> 00:05:54,490
model the GSM protocol it's

143
00:05:54,490 --> 00:06:00,129
decentralized pc again email so we did

144
00:06:00,129 --> 00:06:02,649
solve this with email email is is in

145
00:06:02,649 --> 00:06:04,779
many ways pretty fantastic protocols

146
00:06:04,779 --> 00:06:06,729
been around for 30 years like there's

147
00:06:06,729 --> 00:06:08,050
not many people who can write an app and

148
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:11,499
say yeah my apps okay maybe PHP but very

149
00:06:11,499 --> 00:06:13,449
few systems have been around for as long

150
00:06:13,449 --> 00:06:17,800
as something like email and it it works

151
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:20,259
well because people can innovate on

152
00:06:20,259 --> 00:06:21,639
different areas of the stack you can

153
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:22,929
innovate on the server you can innovate

154
00:06:22,929 --> 00:06:25,149
on the client there's a sub gentleman's

155
00:06:25,149 --> 00:06:27,129
agreement on how it should work this is

156
00:06:27,129 --> 00:06:31,360
codified up into protocols and rfcs but

157
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,539
there's also well we know it's it's

158
00:06:34,539 --> 00:06:36,459
insecure client to server is pretty

159
00:06:36,459 --> 00:06:38,379
secure but server to server as we're

160
00:06:38,379 --> 00:06:39,849
finding out from some of the Snowden

161
00:06:39,849 --> 00:06:41,979
stuff is is pretty damn insecure it's

162
00:06:41,979 --> 00:06:45,849
completely clear text the other thing if

163
00:06:45,849 --> 00:06:47,289
you think about email is like it could

164
00:06:47,289 --> 00:06:50,139
be so much better if you if you get an

165
00:06:50,139 --> 00:06:52,449
email message imagine you're getting an

166
00:06:52,449 --> 00:06:54,939
invoice if this invoice was tagged up

167
00:06:54,939 --> 00:06:57,309
and dealt was the right way it wouldn't

168
00:06:57,309 --> 00:06:58,719
land in your inbox you wouldn't have to

169
00:06:58,719 --> 00:07:00,339
process it would just magically go to

170
00:07:00,339 --> 00:07:01,959
your accounting software or to your

171
00:07:01,959 --> 00:07:04,930
accountant and seriously this is

172
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:08,470
is a bit broken and let me let me just

173
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:10,150
share one other piece of brokenness and

174
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:11,350
then we'll think about how do we fix

175
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:14,949
this so the other part is like we have

176
00:07:14,949 --> 00:07:16,509
all of these services these are great

177
00:07:16,509 --> 00:07:18,190
services so let us do super awesome

178
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:20,050
things but why do we have to have three

179
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:22,960
different accounts on these systems to

180
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,340
be able to post and go to these

181
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:26,050
different sites to post and we never

182
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:28,539
have these comments coming back we're

183
00:07:28,539 --> 00:07:29,979
pretty smart people I'm sure we all

184
00:07:29,979 --> 00:07:31,930
agree that the stuff could be a little

185
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:36,940
bit better so let's think about how do

186
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:38,560
we build this better and I'm going to

187
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,240
share with you some of the things that

188
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,210
that myself and my team have been

189
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:44,229
thinking about some of the problems we

190
00:07:44,229 --> 00:07:45,970
face and how we've we've come up with

191
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:50,410
them we know that the system has to have

192
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:53,229
structured messages you know if you're

193
00:07:53,229 --> 00:07:56,070
passing messages around between systems

194
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:59,259
you kind of wanted to be tagged up in

195
00:07:59,259 --> 00:08:01,750
the right way so this is like the

196
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:04,900
Activity Feed format that's some subject

197
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:08,020
object verb so so-and-so tag so-and-so

198
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:11,979
in southern size photo so that's a good

199
00:08:11,979 --> 00:08:13,690
starting point and that's sort of some

200
00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:14,830
of the stuff that we're starting to

201
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:17,740
think about we definitely want to

202
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:19,300
distribute it anybody should be able to

203
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:21,550
host it should be reliable and it should

204
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:25,659
be easy to implement so in terms of

205
00:08:25,659 --> 00:08:28,539
thinking like how do we use protocols to

206
00:08:28,539 --> 00:08:32,320
design a system where anybody can run it

207
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:35,440
and anybody can build apps on it and all

208
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,870
of these different apps and systems will

209
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:40,240
intercommunicate the first thing we need

210
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,370
to think about is how do we how do we

211
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:44,440
deal with addressing like you know

212
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,029
there's been some social networks that

213
00:08:46,029 --> 00:08:48,700
have said your identity on this on this

214
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:52,570
network is like a URL that sort of works

215
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:55,690
okay but people really sort of think

216
00:08:55,690 --> 00:08:59,770
about their email addresses as an

217
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:02,200
identity so we we took the assumption

218
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:05,170
that email is a good starting point for

219
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:07,060
this doesn't have to be email but the

220
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:09,010
format should be something somewhat like

221
00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:10,839
email and that works really well because

222
00:09:10,839 --> 00:09:13,900
you've kind of got a system example.com

223
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:16,660
knows how to connect to remote com

224
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:18,550
it knows that there's a user at these

225
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:22,300
different services and then all we have

226
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:23,949
to worry about is how do we build an API

227
00:09:23,949 --> 00:09:25,930
and how do we build this Federation

228
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:28,389
protocol between different domains so

229
00:09:28,389 --> 00:09:33,730
these messages can be passed and then if

230
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:36,370
we're if we're building this you know we

231
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:38,199
have to think about how do these servers

232
00:09:38,199 --> 00:09:42,180
find each other and interconnect so

233
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:44,740
again we're going back to our roots the

234
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:46,660
the 30 year old technology comes to the

235
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:49,269
rescue dns has this great record in it

236
00:09:49,269 --> 00:09:52,360
it's called the SRV record and what this

237
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,459
basically says is like when you want to

238
00:09:54,459 --> 00:09:56,920
do something on a remote domain you can

239
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:59,110
find out which server is responsible for

240
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:00,819
that it's not dissimilar to the MX

241
00:10:00,819 --> 00:10:03,430
record in an email which says sending

242
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:05,170
email connect to the server that's the

243
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:07,149
email server this is more generalized

244
00:10:07,149 --> 00:10:09,519
thing what this is saying is like when

245
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:13,300
you want to talk to your app running on

246
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:15,670
a remote site basically connect to port

247
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:19,209
443 and do stuff do stuff using the

248
00:10:19,209 --> 00:10:25,930
protocol but then like we we have

249
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:28,300
clients and going back to our email

250
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:31,060
analogy you currently if you have to set

251
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:32,889
up email on your phone you pull it out

252
00:10:32,889 --> 00:10:34,930
and you've got to find out what your

253
00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:37,269
your mail server is where to send email

254
00:10:37,269 --> 00:10:38,470
stuff like you're going to type that

255
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:40,750
alone we can do much better than that we

256
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:43,449
can actually have a protocol for

257
00:10:43,449 --> 00:10:46,180
discovering like where to connect and

258
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:49,420
this is important because imagine

259
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:51,310
imagine you build this super-awesome

260
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:53,699
next-generation communication protocol

261
00:10:53,699 --> 00:10:56,470
and it's an app and you can download it

262
00:10:56,470 --> 00:10:58,779
it's important because the user expects

263
00:10:58,779 --> 00:11:00,880
to just log in with their user app

264
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,309
domain com and you want to be able to

265
00:11:03,309 --> 00:11:06,430
find out domain com where do I have to

266
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:08,470
go for that like where is the API

267
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:12,850
endpoint for domain com and the guys

268
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:14,800
over at iono have solved this they've

269
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,779
said look there's this DNS record that

270
00:11:16,779 --> 00:11:19,180
you can use to look up stuff so users

271
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:21,040
don't have to put in anything more than

272
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,439
just the username and password and this

273
00:11:23,439 --> 00:11:25,899
basically is its tax record very easy to

274
00:11:25,899 --> 00:11:28,660
parse in any software and that would

275
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:30,200
basically result in

276
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,360
connecting to this server port 443 and

277
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:36,500
then your API would be prefixed with /ap

278
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:39,980
I there's three more problems we have to

279
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:41,870
solve before we can come up with our

280
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:43,310
super awesome next-generation

281
00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:48,710
communication protocol is servers not

282
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:51,290
always being online so how do we resync

283
00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:53,990
our servers this is this is not

284
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:57,170
something that's that there's a perfect

285
00:11:57,170 --> 00:11:59,540
answer to on the body cloud side of

286
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:01,400
things we say that look you know we

287
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,810
can't guarantee that all servers would

288
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:04,520
always be online but when they do come

289
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,860
online they can ping out to all of the

290
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:08,870
other servers with users that follow

291
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:12,730
their their channels or their data and

292
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:15,710
at the same time remote servers can

293
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:18,050
always like keep-keep polling like are

294
00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:20,420
you back online are you back online but

295
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:22,190
it's just something to be aware of

296
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:24,590
because if you assume all servers online

297
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:26,090
you're going to end up with a lot of

298
00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:30,410
problems and then the time to glass is

299
00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:32,450
really important we've worked kinda with

300
00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:35,090
the assumption that with you within one

301
00:12:35,090 --> 00:12:39,800
second you really want to have data

302
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:44,360
appearing on the mobile screen but again

303
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,800
in the distributive world you've got to

304
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:46,910
really rethink a lot of these

305
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:49,280
assumptions so imagine if i turn on my

306
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:51,710
phone and I'm following like 20 people

307
00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:54,680
on 15 different domains my phone now has

308
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:56,690
to go out and discover these do dns

309
00:12:56,690 --> 00:12:58,790
lookups set up TLS connections between

310
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:01,610
15 other different domains as just not

311
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:02,570
really going to be a very impressive

312
00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:05,840
time to glass so this is something that

313
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:08,240
we tried to solve invite card by

314
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,850
building this inbox server so what what

315
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:11,990
happens is when your client is not

316
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:14,420
online these remote servers are pushing

317
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:17,840
data in and pushing updates through into

318
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,880
your inbox it's basically a spool you

319
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:22,340
come back online and within one second

320
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:25,250
you've got data appearing on your screen

321
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:27,560
and I think this is an important sort of

322
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:31,370
architectural or architectural decision

323
00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:33,080
for any type of software to be to be

324
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:35,750
building these things so that you've got

325
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:39,530
a very very fast time to glass and then

326
00:13:39,530 --> 00:13:42,350
it's not just jealous lovers that are

327
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:43,670
trying to write read

328
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:47,000
email this is this is a really tricky

329
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,160
problem to solve like I don't claim that

330
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:54,020
we've we've solved it well yet when you

331
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:56,630
have you know of course email hasn't

332
00:13:56,630 --> 00:13:58,520
even solved the the bottom part of how

333
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,110
do we connect service to service this is

334
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:02,810
something that we've solved but we still

335
00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:04,820
have to work with the assumption that

336
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:06,920
you you trust your sis admin so when

337
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,420
you've got code running on a remote

338
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:10,580
server you have to kind of trust the

339
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:16,670
remotes to said min and well the real

340
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:18,700
solution to this is going to be to have

341
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:23,180
systems that do end-to-end cryptography

342
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:27,950
but you know my parents are not so good

343
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:29,450
and I'm not even so good at managing

344
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:32,090
like private keys on my end devices and

345
00:14:32,090 --> 00:14:33,260
distributing them to different end

346
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:36,370
devices so really tough problem to solve

347
00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:38,690
it is something that we've built the

348
00:14:38,690 --> 00:14:40,280
architecture for and we're trying to

349
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:41,990
think about how do we solve it but it's

350
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:46,700
a tough one so there's this couple of

351
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:48,140
other teams that are also working on

352
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:49,550
this type of stuff you've probably all

353
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:51,770
hold it heard of the Diaspora project

354
00:14:51,770 --> 00:14:55,400
there's the freedom box from the from

355
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:59,120
the Debian guys pump is a pretty cool

356
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:03,070
npm based system that evans working on

357
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:06,920
and you know there's other systems like

358
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:08,660
the and yet guys are doing some pretty

359
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:11,480
awesome stuff with building lots of

360
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:14,330
small systems that then interconnect so

361
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:15,920
there is stuff happening in the space

362
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:23,180
and my like whole to you is that we get

363
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:24,980
involved with standards committees like

364
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:26,270
when you're building your apps think

365
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:27,620
about it if this is something that can

366
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:31,910
be really like pushed to a broader

367
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:35,990
audience however there's a big warning

368
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:37,370
about standards committees there's two

369
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:38,930
types of people on standards committees

370
00:15:38,930 --> 00:15:41,240
the first one is is the type of person

371
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,680
who enjoys being on a standards

372
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:45,070
committee and enjoys writing specs and

373
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:47,300
these are people you really really want

374
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:49,310
to avoid do not go near them they're

375
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:53,810
toxic we try to take the other approach

376
00:15:53,810 --> 00:15:56,570
we try to like build software generalize

377
00:15:56,570 --> 00:15:57,350
it and

378
00:15:57,350 --> 00:15:58,880
then come back and this is so much more

379
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:01,790
powerful because the first group of

380
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:03,590
people really think about how the world

381
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:04,880
should be and I think it's so much

382
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,350
better to accept the world as it is and

383
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:08,420
then build stuff and we discovered that

384
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:10,940
this the hard way we we sort of designed

385
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:13,160
something we found them we had about a

386
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:14,510
million users using this chat

387
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:15,950
application that we built on nokia

388
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:17,960
phones and it turned out to be a

389
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,100
complete nightmare there were so many

390
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:20,990
bad actors so we had to actually go back

391
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:22,490
and change this back and change the

392
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:25,190
protocol to to put in some more sensible

393
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:27,230
assumptions about what people would the

394
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:32,000
initial state of the network so i can

395
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,790
also highly recommend working with the

396
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:36,740
guys at the XMPP standards foundation

397
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:38,210
this is like one of the most friendly

398
00:16:38,210 --> 00:16:39,920
standards committees if you ever need to

399
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,530
pass messages between systems these guys

400
00:16:42,530 --> 00:16:44,030
these guys would love to hear from you

401
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:45,770
it's very easy to write a spec they'll

402
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:48,770
accept it they'd probably give a little

403
00:16:48,770 --> 00:16:50,690
bit of pushback but it's a nice group

404
00:16:50,690 --> 00:16:52,460
and they organise awesome summits every

405
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:56,030
year so I spoken a little bit about

406
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:59,750
buddy cloud we've we've built most of

407
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:01,520
the system we think we've solved a lot

408
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,500
of these problems the code is of course

409
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,630
all open source will try to build

410
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:07,130
reference implementations wherever is

411
00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:10,910
possible what we want is that people

412
00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:16,580
start using using the code and building

413
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:18,950
in like generalized communication into

414
00:17:18,950 --> 00:17:20,870
their products like I think it's crazy

415
00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:22,820
that every single product we rebuild the

416
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:25,100
messaging stack every single time it's

417
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:26,900
like if we had them we wanted to include

418
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:29,270
maps on a web page we would we're not

419
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:31,190
going to build like map rent I'll

420
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:34,100
renderers we simply drop some coded but

421
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:36,860
I think that using AP is and protocols

422
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:39,320
we can actually build a slightly better

423
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:41,750
way of of this communication and this is

424
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:46,820
our roadmap we're almost ready to do an

425
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:49,460
initial release of course there's

426
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:51,440
there's stuff working on the web already

427
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:54,980
if you've got a buddy claro calm and my

428
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:59,630
my call out is like you know this if we

429
00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:01,130
are going to build the next 30 years of

430
00:18:01,130 --> 00:18:02,840
messaging this is the type of audience

431
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:05,270
like if we can't solve this here in this

432
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:07,010
room then we're stuck with email and

433
00:18:07,010 --> 00:18:09,500
Facebook feeds I think

434
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,780
sir it's time to change that so let's

435
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:13,490
let's innovate on the edge and make a

436
00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:29,400
difference thanks everyone
