1
00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:03,270

so this is actually my first time

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:05,520
speaking and a full conference lot

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:07,589
there's also a couple other first time

4
00:00:07,589 --> 00:00:10,170
speakers and we kind of band together to

5
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:12,090
make sure that we supported each other

6
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:14,910
and I think it's the perfect place to be

7
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:17,190
able to have my first big conference

8
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:19,320
experience this is my first time in

9
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:21,420
Iceland I've been blown away so far

10
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:24,660
everybody is so nice and it's so

11
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:25,920
relaxing here

12
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,439
the views are to die for one of the most

13
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:30,720
amazing things about Jess comp Iceland

14
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,399
is that you know accessibility inclusion

15
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:37,050
and diversity are first class citizens

16
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:39,270
and they're not something that they have

17
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:41,520
to try to do it just that's how it is

18
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,950
that's the culture of this conference

19
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:46,050
and even other J's conferences as well

20
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:48,210
but specifically the one in Iceland ajs

21
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:50,239
Club Iceland is just a really wonderful

22
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:52,500

23
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,750
