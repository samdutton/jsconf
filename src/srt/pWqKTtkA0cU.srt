alright this is easy because this is

4
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:16,619

00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:23,369
bailiff people oh I almost forgot the

7
00:00:23,369 --> 00:00:27,300

13
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:49,079
too and I really wanted to talk about

14
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:52,460
how there are really two communities die

15
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:56,250
that that I can Frank to be standing

16
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:58,649
here in the first place and one of those

17
00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:01,350
communities happens to be so I started

18
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:04,260
speaking four years ago this this

19
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:06,869
picture is like 2015

20
00:01:06,869 --> 00:01:09,330
I was doing my day job as a front-end

21
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:12,720
engineer and I discovered meetups I

22
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,790
started going to meetups I was like hey

23
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:17,850
what about what about speaking at one so

24
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:22,380
four years ago I did my first talk it

25
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:24,060
was probably the same length as this one

26
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:27,330
is going to be but there was really two

27
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:30,479
communities that that shaped my path

28
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:34,740
from there on later that year I went to

29
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:37,979
a event that's called Mozilla festival

30
00:01:37,979 --> 00:01:41,490
kind of Indy the Berlin version of the

31
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:44,189
same festival missile festival happens

32
00:01:44,189 --> 00:01:46,049
in London a lot of the Mozilla

33
00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:48,060
contributors here you see a picture of

34
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:51,600
Mozilla reps these are the worldwide

35
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,710
Mozilla contributors who are shaping and

36
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:58,290
volunteering to to talk about Mozilla

37
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:00,390
and I got accepted as part of that I

38
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:04,290
don't even ask me why and I made so many

39
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:06,630
friends as part of this group some of

40
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:09,060
these friends yeah I was just hanging

41
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:13,080
out this past few days hosting me in

42
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:13,830
their apartment

43
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:16,710
because why not crushing their couches

44
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:20,310
just these days so I got to experience

45
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:21,990
some of these are actually people are

46
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:25,980
actually here around us today so this

47
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:28,620
kind of made me I this is this picture

48
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:30,960
took and and Copenhagen

49
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:33,810
if you ever beat the castle at it's a

50
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:35,790
had friends who were photoshopping me

51
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:37,710
into this Cape of the web being the map

52
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:40,770
Savior I think this is this is probably

53
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:42,810
what what makes your heart go when yours

54
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:44,640
a mozillian but there is another

55
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,230
community not just the Missoula

56
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:47,910
community there are large community that

57
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:49,230
shaped my path but that was the

58
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:51,090
JavaScript community if you have been

59
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:52,709
here for say it's a scoff you know that

60
00:02:52,709 --> 00:02:55,250
guy

61
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:57,990
this was web rebels to this date one of

62
00:02:57,990 --> 00:03:00,480
my favorite conferences and to this date

63
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,820
the comp my favorite conferences are

64
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:05,010
never attended I was sitting at home

65
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:07,709
watching the livestream tweeting at

66
00:03:07,709 --> 00:03:09,990
people are having the most fun time of

67
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:10,770
my life

68
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:14,700
eventually this you like the JavaScript

69
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:17,220
community and muscle comedic converted

70
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:18,540
into something that's called missile

71
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:20,820
attack speakers the Mozilla Tech

72
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:23,489
speakers community is missile is

73
00:03:23,489 --> 00:03:26,700
supporting some of its developers so

74
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:28,980
much to deliver contributors and helping

75
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:31,050
them spread the good word and helping

76
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:34,709
them grow in speaking about technical

77
00:03:34,709 --> 00:03:37,920
topics teaching people and this is one

78
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,320
of the first picture with me and some of

79
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,420
our Mozilla contributors one from Poland

80
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:45,290
and one from Tunisia

81
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:49,280
at the very start of the program this

82
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,220
program actually got me to an obscure

83
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:54,140
little conference never happened more

84
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:58,520
than once in Dortmund this very

85
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:02,780
disparate country got invited after a

86
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:05,240
lot of troubles and a lot of like sweat

87
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:08,600
and that excitement and it met even to

88
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,740
this day when I think back to that

89
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:10,610
conference

90
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:13,760
it basically shaped the entirety of Who

91
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:18,859
I am today some of these people I can

92
00:04:18,859 --> 00:04:20,959
affect my my whole on stage presence

93
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:22,990
these people trusted me these people

94
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:25,490
trusted me to go onstage and demo

95
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:29,330
hardware that I barely knew about in the

96
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:30,950
back of this picture Dan Kelly I'm one

97
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:34,160
of the developer evangelists at Mozilla

98
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,290
I can call my colleague and friend now

99
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:41,000
and you know we hold a workshop and this

100
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,130
was the brink of Firefox service

101
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:46,160
becoming a thing and I was in the big

102
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:50,000
stage and from that on I cannot like a

103
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,860
five minute talk a 50 minute dot

104
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:54,620
wouldn't be enough to tell you all the

105
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:57,010
stories of meeting people in Oslo and

106
00:04:57,010 --> 00:04:59,600
visiting their conference in bonus iris

107
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,729
and making friends all around the world

108
00:05:01,729 --> 00:05:04,460
and making lifelong connections and

109
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:06,950
friendships along the way and eventually

110
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:09,350
I got you just confit you not not much

111
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:11,750
longer later I actually have the same

112
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:15,470
hoody with me today like the JavaScript

113
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:20,510
community made a comeback this is this

114
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:22,610
is from a conference they lost reject

115
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:24,710

116
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:27,200
reject Reyes a few days ago as part of

117
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,700

community and the JavaScript speaker

121
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:39,350
budding JavaScript speaker representing

122
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:41,870
the the JavaScript community so you

123
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:44,300
might ask yourself okay what is this

124
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:46,390
arrey have-your-cake- and-eat-it-too

125
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:50,240
thing and the thing actually goes back

126
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,720
to OTS cough this conference I actually

127
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:56,750
was visiting family in Cyprus and they

128
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:58,370
sent this mysterious picture to the

129
00:05:58,370 --> 00:05:58,999
organized

130
00:05:58,999 --> 00:06:02,239

135
00:06:12,829 --> 00:06:14,809
some of these people just to this date

136
00:06:14,809 --> 00:06:19,399
and this all goes back to a cake that I

137
00:06:19,399 --> 00:06:23,619
actually got in Cyprus I went to a cake

140
00:06:30,769 --> 00:06:33,229
dis conference to give a guess to the

141
00:06:33,229 --> 00:06:36,589
conference that trusted me with Widger

142
00:06:36,589 --> 00:06:39,889
the gave me their trust and that gave me

143
00:06:39,889 --> 00:06:42,860
a chance so I can stand today here so if

144
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:45,279
there is anything I could ask you is

145
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:47,599
give people a chance and lift other

146
00:06:47,599 --> 00:06:50,299
