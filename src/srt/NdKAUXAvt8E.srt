1
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:10,280

all right so welcome to the Teenage

2
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:11,410
Mutant Ninja Turtle

3
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:18,100
color theory by Louisa it's me hi I am

4
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:19,420
the director of the front-end

5
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:20,800
engineering program at the Turing school

6
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,590
of software and design we are a seven

7
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:25,540
month a seven month long developer

8
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:28,779
training program based out of Denver I'm

9
00:00:28,779 --> 00:00:31,570
we see be on Twitter and a little bit of

10
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:33,670
background about me I had a very nice

11
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:35,019
introduction but a little bit of

12
00:00:35,019 --> 00:00:36,250
background about me I've been a designer

13
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:38,170
for about 12 years and I switched over

14
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:40,920
to focusing on code about five years ago

15
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:43,780
and I love color theory like I think

16
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:45,040
it's just a really interesting

17
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:47,700
combination of like science and design

18
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:50,410
and aesthetics and just like human

19
00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:52,899
factors with it's a really fun topic to

20
00:00:52,899 --> 00:00:55,809
talk about and it's a really it's a

21
00:00:55,809 --> 00:00:57,879
really important it's an important topic

22
00:00:57,879 --> 00:00:59,289
because it can have a huge impact on

23
00:00:59,289 --> 00:01:03,670
your users I'm also mostly from the big

24
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:05,649
square States and so I'm not really like

25
00:01:05,649 --> 00:01:07,509
used to all the humidity so that kind of

26
00:01:07,509 --> 00:01:09,070
means that this is my current hair

27
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:09,820
situation

28
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:15,490
ah yeah so that's just a disclaimer that

29
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:18,729
that's pretty much where I'm at and I'm

30
00:01:18,729 --> 00:01:22,869
qualified to speak about color and the

31
00:01:22,869 --> 00:01:25,110
teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles because I

32
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:29,830
wanted to be one of them so you can

33
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:32,289
trust me I even though it's missing like

34
00:01:32,289 --> 00:01:34,300
the before primary qualifications to be

35
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:35,380
one of them which is that you know being

36
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:37,990
a turtle and a teenager and a mutant but

37
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:41,860
that's fine um so for this talk we've

38
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:45,610
got six sections we're gonna talk about

39
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:47,610
color groups we're gonna talk about

40
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:50,229
color associations we'll be talking

41
00:01:50,229 --> 00:01:52,300
about the color wheel we'll be talking

42
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:54,250
about color combinations we'll be

43
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:55,599
talking about properties and terms

44
00:01:55,599 --> 00:01:56,500
because we've got to be able to talk

45
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:57,819
about it and we'll be talking about

46
00:01:57,819 --> 00:01:59,890
accessibility because it's important and

47
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:00,849
you should worry about it

48
00:02:00,849 --> 00:02:09,009
so let's get started let's do it so when

49
00:02:09,009 --> 00:02:10,450
we talk about color theory you need to

50
00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:11,560
kind of start at the beginning you have

51
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,150
to like build your foundation and that

52
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:14,230
means we're gonna talk about color

53
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:16,690
groups so there are essentially three

54
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:19,060
big buckets that all colors fall into

55
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:21,730
they are warm cool and neutral so let's

56
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:22,870
dig into it let's talk about it a little

57
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:24,730
bit so

58
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:26,890
warm colors are gonna be sort of like

59
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:28,360
your Reds through your through your

60
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,519
yellows and these are generally thought

61
00:02:30,519 --> 00:02:32,620
to be very positive and energetic so

62
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:34,780
these are colors like colors in this

63
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:36,310
group tend to have actually been shown

64
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:38,799
to have a physical effect on people they

65
00:02:38,799 --> 00:02:40,900
can raise your blood pressure they can

66
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:44,110
increase your respiration they can even

67
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:46,690
enhance your metabolism and so if you

68
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:48,430
think about the kinds of brands that

69
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:51,280
often use colors in this in this in this

70
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,079
color group they're often trying to

71
00:02:53,079 --> 00:02:55,840
communicate like fun or playfulness or

72
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,480
in like the case of like McDonald's

73
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,519
they're trying to like one encourage you

74
00:03:00,519 --> 00:03:01,720
to want to eat more and then also kind

75
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,609
of move you through the store faster so

76
00:03:03,609 --> 00:03:06,750
they can you know sell more high-quality

77
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:11,200
hamburgers then we have the cool color

78
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,530
group so again colors in this group are

79
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:15,640
kind of like basically the opposite of

80
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:16,930
our warm color group so they're gonna be

81
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:18,280
a little bit calmer a little bit more

82
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:21,129
soothing a little more relaxing you get

83
00:03:21,129 --> 00:03:23,019
like your greens your blues and like

84
00:03:23,019 --> 00:03:25,840
your purples in this range colors in

85
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,340
this group are often associated with

86
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:29,859
stability and composure and again if you

87
00:03:29,859 --> 00:03:31,840
think about the types of brands that are

88
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,389
using these colors they're often they're

89
00:03:34,389 --> 00:03:36,400
often trying to like really encourage

90
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,840
you to trust them so you'll see a lot of

91
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,849
like banks and hospitals and insurance

92
00:03:39,849 --> 00:03:40,930
companies that tend to have their

93
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:42,730
branding skewing a little bit more

94
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:43,989
towards the cool side of the color

95
00:03:43,989 --> 00:03:48,130
spectrum then we have neutral colors

96
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:50,319
these can you know sort of skew either

97
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:52,389
warm or cool depending on the specific

98
00:03:52,389 --> 00:03:54,459
blend of the color so you'll see these

99
00:03:54,459 --> 00:03:56,230
these top three colors are a little bit

100
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:57,970
cooler and then the bottom three colors

101
00:03:57,970 --> 00:03:59,859
bottom two I can count that's fine the

102
00:03:59,859 --> 00:04:01,840
bottom two colors are a little bit

103
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,840
warmer and so it's kind of so-so

104
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,849
neutrals are often basically they're

105
00:04:06,849 --> 00:04:09,970
used most often is like the the base or

106
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:11,500
foundation of your color palette and

107
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:12,790
then a warmer a cool tone might be

108
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:14,760
pulled in as an accent color

109
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:18,880
so our final color group our group that

110
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:19,989
I'm going to be talking about it's a non

111
00:04:19,989 --> 00:04:21,039
color group but we're gonna talk about

112
00:04:21,039 --> 00:04:23,979
mutants a little bit so they tend to

113
00:04:23,979 --> 00:04:26,020
also have you know fairly specific uses

114
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:27,940
and like a use cases you'll see the

115
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:29,320
minutes is you know generally pretty

116
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,880
pretty focused so if you think I like

117
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,719
the x-men or Godzilla or the turtles

118
00:04:33,719 --> 00:04:37,660
they have they very specific use cases

119
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:39,640
also have very strong cultural

120
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:43,600
associations which leads us to color

121
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:47,320
associations so whether we realize it or

122
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:50,820
not colors have very very strong

123
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:53,500
associations built into them so if you

124
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,840
pick a color that your users don't like

125
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,270
they're going to be like pushed away

126
00:04:58,270 --> 00:04:59,530
from using your site or using your

127
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:01,420
product simply because the cut we have

128
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:03,400
so we have such strong connection to

129
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,230
color and we have relate to it so

130
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:06,670
intensely that it can it can actually

131
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:10,630
like push people away so and and what

132
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:11,830
but what these what these meanings that

133
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:13,390
we have about colors can be a very

134
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:15,820
subjective so they can change or or vary

135
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:18,640
based on the communities or the cultures

136
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:22,930
that we grew up in so so some colors can

137
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:24,640
have variation have kind of one specific

138
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:25,810
meaning and one culture and a very

139
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:27,190
different meaning in another culture so

140
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:29,800
if you think about the color white in in

141
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:32,080
most Western cultures it's associated

142
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,940
with like purity and cleanliness and

143
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:35,380
maybe like a fresh start or in the

144
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:38,650
beginning and then in in other cultures

145
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:40,210
and some Eastern cultures it is

146
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:41,980
associated with death and it's often

147
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:44,650
like the color that is worn at funerals

148
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:45,760
it's like a color associated with

149
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:48,520
mourning so you know you can have these

150
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:50,740
two these this one color but two pretty

151
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:52,300
pretty vastly different meanings

152
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:53,560
associated with it so it's important to

153
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,390
understand understand that the

154
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:57,100
associations that are bound to a

155
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:58,750
specific color as you're applying it to

156
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:03,400
your product or or your team so when

157
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,780
we're talking about color associations

158
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:06,550
red is a color that has some of these

159
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:08,950
strongest associations bound to it and

160
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:10,660
it can be very polarizing it's a very

161
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:13,600
passionate color it can be associated

162
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,100
with love and it can also be associated

163
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:17,500
with like like the devil right so it's a

164
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:18,730
very polarizing color if you think about

165
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:19,930
the Turtles

166
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:22,600
we have Raph like good old Raphael good

167
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,970
old Raph and if we think about him he is

168
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:26,980
very strongly bound to these cultural

169
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:28,450
associations that we have with red

170
00:06:28,450 --> 00:06:30,970
surrended this very passionate color and

171
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:33,010
so is Raphael he is like the hot head of

172
00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:34,570
the group right so he's he's a little

173
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:36,640
movie moody he's kind of a Jersey boy he

174
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:39,310
gets a little sassy sometimes and he's

175
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:42,130
just this very like intense character

176
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:44,470
and has a lot of feelings sometimes like

177
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:45,700
when he's when he's happy he's really

178
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:47,629
happy when he's angry

179
00:06:47,629 --> 00:06:48,919
and so if we think about some of these

180
00:06:48,919 --> 00:06:50,990
like big sort of terms that are often

181
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:52,479
associated with red we have like

182
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:55,550
determination we have anger Rafael gets

183
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:56,990
a little bit angry sometimes he's a very

184
00:06:56,990 --> 00:06:58,669
intense character which are all things

185
00:06:58,669 --> 00:07:01,030
that are bound to read really intensely

186
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:04,580
if we think about orange oranges if you

187
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:06,110
still get some of that like intensity

188
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:08,060
and that that energy from red but it's a

189
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:09,439
little bit softened if the little tone

190
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:11,270
down if we think about it's a little bit

191
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:12,710
more playful whereas red could be very

192
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:14,719
intense and very like passionate oranges

193
00:07:14,719 --> 00:07:16,099
is more playful and a little bit more

194
00:07:16,099 --> 00:07:17,150
goofy and a little bit more lighthearted

195
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:19,520
so if we think about the Turtles with

196
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,199
Mikey

197
00:07:20,199 --> 00:07:22,580
Michelangelo so he's like the goofball

198
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:23,750
of the group right so he's gonna be a

199
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:24,800
little bit more fun a little bit

200
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,020
easygoing he's still very like active

201
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:28,879
and engaging but he's not the same level

202
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:32,389
of intensity as Raphael so again if we

203
00:07:32,389 --> 00:07:33,800
think about how we might see orange

204
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,659
applied in like the real world you often

205
00:07:35,659 --> 00:07:37,219
see it applied to like children's toys

206
00:07:37,219 --> 00:07:38,240
or like things that you really want to

207
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,919
just imply that you're having fun now

208
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:43,039
like you're having a good time then if

209
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:45,379
we get into blue so we're kind of

210
00:07:45,379 --> 00:07:47,029
hopping back over to the cool side of

211
00:07:47,029 --> 00:07:49,969
the color groups so blue is is a very

212
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:51,860
it's a very centered it's a very

213
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:54,620
centered and calming color and with the

214
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:56,839
turtles again we have Leonardo so

215
00:07:56,839 --> 00:07:59,120
Leonardo is like the leader of the group

216
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,919
he's like the grounding force of the

217
00:08:00,919 --> 00:08:02,360
turtles he's a very calm he's very

218
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,849
level-headed he is able to sort of like

219
00:08:04,849 --> 00:08:06,529
read a situation and act appropriately

220
00:08:06,529 --> 00:08:08,750
he's not going to just act out of

221
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:10,699
instinct or just because he's upset like

222
00:08:10,699 --> 00:08:13,310
Raphael will he is very much like this

223
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:14,750
grounding force of the turtles he's like

224
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:16,370
the leader of the group he's also

225
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:18,680
incredibly focused and dedicated to the

226
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,389
team as a whole so these are all again

227
00:08:20,389 --> 00:08:22,189
things that are we see reflected in the

228
00:08:22,189 --> 00:08:24,139
color blue um they're like people of

229
00:08:24,139 --> 00:08:25,699
Lowe's associated with loyalty and

230
00:08:25,699 --> 00:08:27,229
intelligence and confidence and these

231
00:08:27,229 --> 00:08:28,279
are all things that are reflected in

232
00:08:28,279 --> 00:08:31,610
Leonardo then we have purple and purple

233
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:32,990
is a really interesting color so the

234
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:35,029
history of purple is pretty cool so it

235
00:08:35,029 --> 00:08:37,099
was historically it's been really hard

236
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:40,190
to access the the dye to make purple was

237
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:42,199
very expensive it was really hard to get

238
00:08:42,199 --> 00:08:44,750
and so the people who had it or had

239
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:47,750
access to it more often people that were

240
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:50,149
in sort of like either like monarchies

241
00:08:50,149 --> 00:08:52,279
or like the clergy so they were there

242
00:08:52,279 --> 00:08:55,010
were people who had access to money and

243
00:08:55,010 --> 00:08:56,390
that meant that they were often more

244
00:08:56,390 --> 00:08:58,089
educated than the rest of the population

245
00:08:58,089 --> 00:09:00,770
which meant that purple is often

246
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:01,130
associated

247
00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:04,160
with like wisdom and creativity and like

248
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,480
dignity and then if we think of the

249
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:07,460
turtles again we have Donatello and he's

250
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:08,600
like the engineer of the group he's the

251
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,010
problem solver he's always like he's

252
00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:11,570
very like studious and he's industrious

253
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:13,040
he's still a little bit like he can get

254
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,270
a little goofy still but like he's the

255
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:16,250
one who's like he's the problem solver

256
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:19,040
so he sort of he really aligns with

257
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,200
these sort of historical associations

258
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,750
that we have with purple and we have

259
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:25,100
neutral and again neutral is like the

260
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:26,180
background that all of these other

261
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:27,950
brighter bolder colors can sort of rest

262
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:30,560
on top of it is very centered it's very

263
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,750
calming and then of course we have

264
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:35,030
splinter so splinter is like the

265
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:36,770
grounding force of the turtles he is

266
00:09:36,770 --> 00:09:39,230
like the like consistent background on

267
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:40,250
like the turtles are like the little

268
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:42,830
accent colors that he is like supporting

269
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:44,690
and working with I'm so he's laying this

270
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:46,460
like really solid foundation for them to

271
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:47,870
kind of be themselves and grew into

272
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:51,110
their own it's great so now that we know

273
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:53,780
these big buckets about cultic all

274
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:56,570
colors fall into we can talk about the

275
00:09:56,570 --> 00:09:59,750
color wheel so or as I've heard it

276
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:03,530
described that the pizza of color so we

277
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:04,640
now that we can just we can start to

278
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:05,870
talk about like the relationships

279
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:08,960
between colors and so the color the

280
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,700
color wheel essentially lets us

281
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:12,560
understand the purity of colors and then

282
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,330
also how they are created so it helps us

283
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:16,040
understand a little bit more of like the

284
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,270
Navy greeted behind what's going on

285
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:20,450
under behind the scenes so we start off

286
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:22,520
with primary colors so primary colors

287
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:25,520
are pure colors so these are gonna be

288
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:28,820
red blue and yellow so all colors come

289
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:32,090
from primary colors you cannot blend

290
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:33,800
other two colors together to create a

291
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,720
primary color they are like they're like

292
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,310
your source of truth when it comes to

293
00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:39,890
colors so that they are out there the

294
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:41,480
base for all other colors I'll call all

295
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,340
other colors are made from combining red

296
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:45,590
blue and yellow and we talked about the

297
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:46,870
turtles

298
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:50,690
we got Leonardo and Raphael so again we

299
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:52,270
have this hot cool dynamics we have

300
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:54,470
organ like Leonardo's in the cool color

301
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:56,360
group Raphael is in the warm color group

302
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,130
they are the most intense like

303
00:10:58,130 --> 00:11:00,770
passionate colors that we have the

304
00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:02,330
personality types there but their

305
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:03,710
personalities are the most like intense

306
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:05,900
and like pure they butt heads a little

307
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:07,750
bit more they're they can kind of like

308
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,710
kind of get each other going a little

309
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:11,960
bit but they also can't like balance

310
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,760
each other out so if Raphael gets really

311
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:14,540
wound up Leo's

312
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:16,130
gonna be there to like bring them back

313
00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:17,480
down a little bit and kind of calm him

314
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:20,210
down so they you get you get this hot

315
00:11:20,210 --> 00:11:21,770
cool dynamic but they really they

316
00:11:21,770 --> 00:11:23,510
balance each other really effectively

317
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:26,870
and really well and we have secondary

318
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:28,940
colors so secondary colors are created

319
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:31,370
by blending in equal amounts to primary

320
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:34,820
colors so you take like like red and

321
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:36,110
yellow blended together is gonna be

322
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:37,640
orange so essentially like you can just

323
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:38,900
take these two colors two primary colors

324
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:39,950
and blend them together in equal amounts

325
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:42,040
and turned it for the secondary color

326
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:44,840
and then when you come to the turtles

327
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,900
again we have Donatello and Michelangelo

328
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:49,130
so we still have that hot cool dynamic

329
00:11:49,130 --> 00:11:51,050
like we Mikey Mikey's a little bit goofy

330
00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:52,520
he's like the party guy and then Donna

331
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:53,780
tells a little bit more studious and a

332
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:56,150
little bit more focused but they don't

333
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:58,360
really butt heads the same way that

334
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,410
Raphael and Leonardo do because they're

335
00:12:00,410 --> 00:12:02,120
secondary colors so their personalities

336
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,710
are a little bit toned down they're a

337
00:12:03,710 --> 00:12:05,450
little bit less intense but there's

338
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:06,980
still these really bold punchy colors

339
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:08,420
that are still very like very

340
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:09,950
opinionated and have a lot of opinions

341
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:13,070
about things cool so now that we

342
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:15,350
understand some of how color where

343
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:16,580
colors come from we understand a little

344
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:18,080
bit of like the basics of the color

345
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,100
wheel we can start to talk about

346
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:22,960
combining colors because as we all know

347
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:25,220
making a color palette can be a little

348
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:26,840
bit overwhelming it can sometimes seem

349
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:27,950
like it's not gonna be that big a deal

350
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:30,020
and then it just turns into like like a

351
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:32,900
vacuum of sadness trying to find like a

352
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:34,730
nice color palette it can be hard so

353
00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:36,470
we're going to talk about some basic

354
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:38,780
strategies for to kind of like help you

355
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:40,700
think about approaching color palettes

356
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:41,840
and how where to get started and how to

357
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:44,780
get how to roll with that so to get

358
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:46,220
started we're on the color wheel we have

359
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:48,500
the first sort of most simple type of

360
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,030
color combination as a complimentary

361
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:52,280
color combination and this is two colors

362
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:54,410
that sit directly across the color wheel

363
00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:58,130
from each other and they so you're gonna

364
00:12:58,130 --> 00:13:00,110
end up with a very high contrast pairing

365
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:01,400
like in this example we have the sort of

366
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,260
like a rich purple and then a bright

367
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:04,940
yellow so they're gonna be very high

368
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:06,500
contrast which means that you're gonna

369
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,180
get they're gonna be like you'll have a

370
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:10,100
pretty high a pretty pretty great

371
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:12,470
difference in involve of value so the

372
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:15,200
lightness and darkness of a color but it

373
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,430
doesn't they don't always look super

374
00:13:16,430 --> 00:13:18,080
nice because they are so high contrast

375
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,910
so when you actually like but them up

376
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:21,830
against each other that that boundary

377
00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:22,970
edge between them might actually have a

378
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:24,470
little bit of visual vibration so that

379
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:25,940
that line between the two actually might

380
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:27,740
kind of kind of vibrate a little bit it

381
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:28,160
might not be

382
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:31,730
super-nice so to kind of get around that

383
00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:33,019
we have this concept of a split

384
00:13:33,019 --> 00:13:34,910
complementary color so a split

385
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:37,430
complementary is basically you take a

386
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:39,259
complementary color combination and then

387
00:13:39,259 --> 00:13:41,149
one of them you go up a tick or down a

388
00:13:41,149 --> 00:13:42,980
tick on the color wheel to kind of

389
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:45,230
soften that combination just a little

390
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:47,329
bit so it's a little bit less a little

391
00:13:47,329 --> 00:13:49,459
bit less high contrast a little bit

392
00:13:49,459 --> 00:13:51,259
softer you'll see a lot of sports teams

393
00:13:51,259 --> 00:13:54,319
are like leveraging split complementary

394
00:13:54,319 --> 00:13:55,339
color combinations because they're

395
00:13:55,339 --> 00:13:56,329
bright and punchy but they're not

396
00:13:56,329 --> 00:13:58,160
necessarily like they don't necessarily

397
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,810
like fight too bad like when you

398
00:13:59,810 --> 00:14:00,589
actually look at them they don't really

399
00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:03,199
like fight too much then we had this

400
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:05,029
concept of triads so triad is

401
00:14:05,029 --> 00:14:06,589
essentially you take a triangle and you

402
00:14:06,589 --> 00:14:08,089
drop it on the color wheel and you end

403
00:14:08,089 --> 00:14:09,910
up with a really equally distributed

404
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:13,220
combination of colors and again you get

405
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:16,850
a really vibrant bright combo without

406
00:14:16,850 --> 00:14:18,829
having to and you kind of you can either

407
00:14:18,829 --> 00:14:21,589
get a couple of cool colors and a warm

408
00:14:21,589 --> 00:14:23,269
color or a couple of cool colors and a

409
00:14:23,269 --> 00:14:24,800
warm color just it breaks it up really

410
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:25,939
nicely and you get it you get a nice

411
00:14:25,939 --> 00:14:31,149
range of tones then we have a to tragic

412
00:14:31,149 --> 00:14:33,410
color combination this is when you take

413
00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:35,420
a rectangle and you drop that on the

414
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:38,240
color wheel and that means that you end

415
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:41,660
up with the turtles and this is as close

416
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:43,370
as they get to conspiracy theories so

417
00:14:43,370 --> 00:14:47,180
we've got so we have we have the turtles

418
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:48,709
here and like what may have seemed like

419
00:14:48,709 --> 00:14:51,319
an arbitrary combination of colors just

420
00:14:51,319 --> 00:14:52,730
picked out of a hat willy-nilly is

421
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:55,579
actually very intentional so we can do

422
00:14:55,579 --> 00:14:58,100
that we've got this very equally like

423
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:01,399
equally balanced very carefully crafted

424
00:15:01,399 --> 00:15:02,899
combination of colors that gives us is

425
00:15:02,899 --> 00:15:07,069
very soft nuts off but a very like

426
00:15:07,069 --> 00:15:09,980
balanced color combination and a really

427
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:11,720
nice mix of hot cool and then very

428
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:14,139
aggressive and slightly softer

429
00:15:14,139 --> 00:15:16,100
combinations and relationships between

430
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:18,559
colors and characters so there's a lot

431
00:15:18,559 --> 00:15:19,850
of contrast but there's not necessarily

432
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:26,449
conflict so now so now that we have now

433
00:15:26,449 --> 00:15:27,470
that we kind of understand the color

434
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:29,149
wheel we understand how to make like how

435
00:15:29,149 --> 00:15:30,829
to start making some color combinations

436
00:15:30,829 --> 00:15:32,750
now we're going to talk about color

437
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:34,220
properties so this is essentially going

438
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:36,709
to give us the vocabulary to be able to

439
00:15:36,709 --> 00:15:38,149
speak about color a little bit more

440
00:15:38,149 --> 00:15:39,880
effectively so we kind of

441
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,230
when we're working with it we can we can

442
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:43,060
speak a little bit better to it we can

443
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:44,650
explain it to our teams a little bit

444
00:15:44,650 --> 00:15:46,720
more effectively and it also just makes

445
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:49,030
you like really fun at parties she can

446
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:50,230
just show them be like hey grandma

447
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:52,990
guess what so um it's really good for

448
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:54,100
holiday gatherings

449
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:57,130
protip so so we're gonna talk about this

450
00:15:57,130 --> 00:15:59,110
let's dive right in so first we're gonna

451
00:15:59,110 --> 00:16:02,530
talk about hue so hue is essentially

452
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:05,440
it's almost like a synonym for color it

453
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:08,410
is like a pure color so these are going

454
00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:09,790
to be so something that could be

455
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:11,410
considered a hue is essentially like the

456
00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:13,480
colors that you might find in a like an

457
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:15,040
8 pack of crayons so the colors that

458
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,720
have names so you could say like like

459
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:19,300
red or blue or green the colors that you

460
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:21,070
can really kind of you can identify a

461
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:24,460
name with a word those are often those

462
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:28,470
are often referred to as hues so cool

463
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:31,870
then we have value and so value

464
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:34,180
describes the lightness or darkness of a

465
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:35,920
color and it has to do with how much

466
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,990
light that color is allowing to reflect

467
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:40,090
back into your eye so if we have a

468
00:16:40,090 --> 00:16:42,790
really dark color or that is going to

469
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:44,260
have a low value because that means that

470
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:45,970
it is absorbing more light than it is

471
00:16:45,970 --> 00:16:47,950
reflecting back to you and then if we

472
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:50,800
have a a high value that means that it's

473
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,330
a light color which is reflecting more

474
00:16:52,330 --> 00:16:53,680
light back into your eye than it is like

475
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,570
absorbing away from you so in this

476
00:16:55,570 --> 00:16:57,580
example we have this really sort of deep

477
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:59,830
purple that is a low value and then this

478
00:16:59,830 --> 00:17:01,120
really bright yellow that is a high

479
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,160
value so we have hue which is gonna be

480
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:05,500
the pure a pure tone a pure color and

481
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,420
then we have value which is the

482
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:10,990
lightness or darkness of a color then we

483
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:15,970
have tone so tones are made by mixing a

484
00:17:15,970 --> 00:17:18,760
pure color with a neutral or a grayscale

485
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:20,050
of color and for this for this talk

486
00:17:20,050 --> 00:17:21,040
we're gonna use it I'm just gonna use

487
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,620
white and black so essentially a tone

488
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:25,209
will be a little bit softer than the

489
00:17:25,209 --> 00:17:27,160
original color so it essentially kind of

490
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:30,430
creates a range of range within a color

491
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:32,890
so so if you have like created a

492
00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:34,210
complementary color combination and

493
00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:35,140
you're like this is a little too intense

494
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:36,910
you could start to work with tones to

495
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:38,260
kind of soften one of those colors a

496
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:43,840
little bit so so tone would be just like

497
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,060
the the pure the pure to the pure color

498
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:49,030
and then within there we have tints so a

499
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:50,830
tint would be if you added white to a

500
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:53,060
color so you had a like a range

501
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:55,280
going towards to towards a lighter color

502
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,800
and then a shade would be if you edit

503
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:00,080
black and you went down towards a really

504
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:05,840
dark color so then we have saturation so

505
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,420
saturation defines the range of purity

506
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:09,860
of a color and this is pretty

507
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:11,300
interesting so you go from having a

508
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:13,100
hundred percent saturated so this very

509
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:15,290
very bright bold sort of yellowy green

510
00:18:15,290 --> 00:18:17,390
color here and then you have zero

511
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:18,980
percent saturated which becomes this

512
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:21,830
gray and one thing that's kind of

513
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:24,830
interesting is that a completely d

514
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:26,720
saturated color while it is great it's

515
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,580
actually like tonal so it pairs really

516
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:32,210
this is a great way to find a neutral

517
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:33,650
color palette that works with an accent

518
00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:35,900
color so if you're looking to find if

519
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:37,640
you want to if you have like if you have

520
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:39,800
a warm color or a cool color that you

521
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:40,970
really want to use as your is your

522
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:42,920
bright punchy accent color and then you

523
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,270
want to have a neutral background for

524
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:46,640
that desaturating one of that bad accent

525
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:47,930
color to that tonal gray and then

526
00:18:47,930 --> 00:18:49,640
finding it like a range of tones within

527
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:52,220
that tonal gray is a really great way to

528
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:54,230
build out that that background because

529
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:55,490
it's gonna it's gonna work really

530
00:18:55,490 --> 00:18:56,750
effectively with that really bright

531
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:58,870
punchy super saturated color

532
00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:01,730
and since we're speaking about tonal

533
00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:04,100
gray total Gray's actually pretty

534
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:05,360
interesting so when you're when you're

535
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,700
actually painting the way you get tonal

536
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:09,710
Gray's you can take two colors that are

537
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:12,470
on equal so total gray like just to

538
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:13,850
desaturate a color when you're painting

539
00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:15,620
you take two colors that are on opposite

540
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:16,970
sides of the color wheel and you blend

541
00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:19,340
them in equal amounts and eventually you

542
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:21,410
get to this tonal gray so essentially

543
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:23,060
the way you get to that gray color is by

544
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:25,820
combining all these elements by these

545
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:27,560
these colors together and then you end

546
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:28,640
up with this to agree that will work

547
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,200
really effectively with either color

548
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:32,120
that you started from and so when we

549
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:35,330
bring it back to the Turtles splinter is

550
00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:38,570
your tonal grain so so if we think about

551
00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:39,980
this he's like at the center then he's

552
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:42,470
at the core of the turtles he is an

553
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:44,360
equal combination of all of his students

554
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:46,340
right so he is he's at the center of

555
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:47,960
them if you combined any one of them in

556
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:48,770
equal amounts

557
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:50,330
you're gonna hit splinter cuz he's at

558
00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:52,460
the core of their being he raised them

559
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:56,180
from tiny radioactive babies so so

560
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:58,010
splinter is essentially the tonal gray

561
00:19:58,010 --> 00:20:02,540
of the turtles all right so

562
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:05,810
No so now that we know we have

563
00:20:05,810 --> 00:20:07,790
vocabulary we can speak about color we

564
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:09,830
understand the color wheel now we're

565
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:11,150
going to talk about some accessibility

566
00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:14,540
strategies because it's important and we

567
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:16,370
need to like as as was mentioned earlier

568
00:20:16,370 --> 00:20:18,290
this morning like there is a large

569
00:20:18,290 --> 00:20:20,510
percentage of the population that has a

570
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:23,180
color vision deficiency so that's about

571
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:25,550
it's about four-and-a-half percent of

572
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:27,680
the population in the US that's like 13

573
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:30,170
million people that's a lot that's a lot

574
00:20:30,170 --> 00:20:34,160
of humans so what's important like one

575
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,800
of it one of the so most sort of

576
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:38,330
straightforward ways to help to help

577
00:20:38,330 --> 00:20:41,330
avoid causing problems or struggles for

578
00:20:41,330 --> 00:20:44,570
your for your users who are or some have

579
00:20:44,570 --> 00:20:46,640
some amount of color blindness is to not

580
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,040
rely exclusively on Keller to deliver a

581
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:51,620
message to your users so as an example

582
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:54,140
let's talk about forms who did the love

583
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:55,330
a good form

584
00:20:55,330 --> 00:20:59,140
super-nice so if we look at this example

585
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:02,750
we have we're using red and green to

586
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:04,850
show an error message like this form

587
00:21:04,850 --> 00:21:06,980
hasn't successfully been submitted and

588
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:08,210
we're using red and green to show which

589
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:11,990
field was problematic cool like red

590
00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:13,310
green that makes sense like green is

591
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:16,430
success red is error if you can see if

592
00:21:16,430 --> 00:21:18,110
you can life if you have like full color

593
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:21,470
vision that works great that's awesome

594
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:23,720
what's not awesome is that the most

595
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,370
common form of color blindness is

596
00:21:25,370 --> 00:21:27,410
red-green color blindness so what you're

597
00:21:27,410 --> 00:21:28,760
essentially doing if this is your

598
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:31,370
approach to this is that you are setting

599
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:32,960
up a knot you're setting up a pretty

600
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:35,240
significant portion of your user base to

601
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:37,310
fail so I put I put this form through a

602
00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:39,620
red-green color a red vein color vision

603
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:41,750
deficiency simulator here and now we can

604
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:43,760
see that it completely falls down like

605
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:46,340
this didn't submit I have no idea what

606
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:48,110
happened like I don't know what I did I

607
00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:49,580
don't know what I didn't do I'm not sure

608
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:50,780
what's happening and I don't know how to

609
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:53,030
fix it so if I was a user I'd be super

610
00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:54,620
upset I'd be afraid well depending on

611
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:55,670
what I was trying to do poster likes a

612
00:21:55,670 --> 00:21:56,870
bit my taxes yeah I'd be really upset

613
00:21:56,870 --> 00:22:00,320
but you know like you are we're not

614
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,670
helping them we're making it harder for

615
00:22:01,670 --> 00:22:04,760
them so and again the the solution to

616
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:07,640
this is to not rely solely on colors so

617
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:11,150
we can combine color with other visual

618
00:22:11,150 --> 00:22:12,980
communication tools to allow us to be

619
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:14,990
more effective and to be more effective

620
00:22:14,990 --> 00:22:16,010
with communicating to

621
00:22:16,010 --> 00:22:19,010
users so in this in this example we're

622
00:22:19,010 --> 00:22:20,720
essentially using the same form we've

623
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,820
made a slight adjustment we're still

624
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:24,980
using red and green on the around the

625
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:28,880
inputs to dictate what in which inputs

626
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,910
failed but now we've added icons and

627
00:22:31,910 --> 00:22:35,300
we've added an error message so we are

628
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:37,910
communicating we're like we're using our

629
00:22:37,910 --> 00:22:39,710
words to explain where you're just

630
00:22:39,710 --> 00:22:41,390
what's going on and we're also using

631
00:22:41,390 --> 00:22:47,180
some pretty straightforward icons I

632
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:49,100
forgot the word for icon itself so we're

633
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:51,260
using some pretty some pretty pretty

634
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:53,090
like clear icons they might not be like

635
00:22:53,090 --> 00:22:54,320
as we as we mentioned early again

636
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:55,760
earlier this morning like universal

637
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,260
icons aren't really a thing but if you

638
00:22:57,260 --> 00:23:00,080
keep them simple like this is this this

639
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:02,120
combined with with an error message and

640
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:03,290
some some sort of like visual other

641
00:23:03,290 --> 00:23:04,760
visual cues this is this is this will

642
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:06,950
work so now when we put this through a

643
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:09,440
color vision deficiency simulator now we

644
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,120
see that this still holds up I can still

645
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,470
figure out what's going on and what I

646
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:16,100
need to fix to make this worm go well so

647
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:17,900
essentially like this is a great example

648
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:19,610
of using color to highlight and

649
00:23:19,610 --> 00:23:21,170
complement what's already on the page so

650
00:23:21,170 --> 00:23:22,670
we already have icons we already have an

651
00:23:22,670 --> 00:23:24,170
error message and we're using cop we're

652
00:23:24,170 --> 00:23:26,020
not relying on color to be the primary

653
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:28,610
delivery method of this message where

654
00:23:28,610 --> 00:23:32,030
we're using it to complement that so if

655
00:23:32,030 --> 00:23:34,610
we're bring it back to the turtles so we

656
00:23:34,610 --> 00:23:36,320
take a look at these guys and like we

657
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:37,730
are really so far we've been just

658
00:23:37,730 --> 00:23:39,260
completely relying on color to tell

659
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:40,460
these guys apart but really if you think

660
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:42,250
about it they all kind of look the same

661
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:44,360
like they don't have noses you can't

662
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:45,470
really see they don't have different

663
00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:46,640
like they just they look very similar

664
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:51,410
but what we can what we how we can tell

665
00:23:51,410 --> 00:23:55,640
them apart is with their weapons so if I

666
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:57,260
put I put the turtles through a color

667
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:59,420
vision deficiency simulator and so now

668
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:01,790
you still know exactly who's who because

669
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:03,500
they all have very different and

670
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:05,480
distinct weapons so again like we're not

671
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:07,940
relying solely on color to communicate

672
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:10,370
which turtle is which we're just

673
00:24:10,370 --> 00:24:12,320
complimenting what's already on the page

674
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,870
or the you know the reptile spine and so

675
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:16,820
so now we're communicating more

676
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:18,530
effectively and we've essentially we've

677
00:24:18,530 --> 00:24:21,050
just made the Turtles accessible we did

678
00:24:21,050 --> 00:24:21,410
it

679
00:24:21,410 --> 00:24:26,160
alright so to sum up

680
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:29,370
we covered six parts and they covered

681
00:24:29,370 --> 00:24:32,840
colors and conspiracy theories my

682
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:35,160
research and references were pretty much

683
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:38,960
exclusively being a kid in the 90s and

684
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:49,289
pretty sure I nailed it
