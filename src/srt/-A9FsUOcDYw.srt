days and you can also DM e on Twitter I

24
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:05,339
would like to tell you the story of my

25
00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:09,119
life as short as possible my school was

26
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:11,430
pretty clear that I'm different to other

27
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:13,860
kids I read books in the breaks

28
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:16,259
I had a gossip wearing only black

29
00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:20,189
clothes reading mangas and skateboarding

30
00:01:20,189 --> 00:01:23,400
and so on and I was bullied for who I am

31
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,900
and what I am and I started to

32
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:29,390
questioning myself what is wrong with me

33
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:33,479
what did I wrong and I came to the

34
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:35,280
conclusion my behavior must be wrong

35
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,729
this is why no one likes me and I should

36
00:01:38,729 --> 00:01:40,320
stop being the creep sitting in the

37
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,180
breaks on a bench while reading Harry

38
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:44,579
Potter I should stop skating and I

39
00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:48,119
should stop being myself I tried to fit

40
00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:50,009
in the role of the teenage girl but it

41
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:52,649
doesn't work out and I felt like a fraud

42
00:01:52,649 --> 00:01:56,820
and faking my way through it and my time

43
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:58,649
at school was close to horrible and I

44
00:01:58,649 --> 00:02:00,560
was happy when I lived at school but

45
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,360
when I started working it doesn't make a

46
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,250
huge difference for me I wasn't bullied

47
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:08,270
anymore which was kind of good I think

48
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:11,430
but I still was not a real part of the

49
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:13,819
group and why my colleagues went out for

50
00:02:13,819 --> 00:02:17,019
after work party I was heading back home

51
00:02:17,019 --> 00:02:19,849
we have some nice chats at the coffee

52
00:02:19,849 --> 00:02:21,469
machine at work but I figured out that

53
00:02:21,469 --> 00:02:23,959
we do not share any interests and again

54
00:02:23,959 --> 00:02:27,560
I try to fill in and try to talk about

55
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:30,769
TV series where I only read the last

56
00:02:30,769 --> 00:02:33,079
news about it so that I can talk about

57
00:02:33,079 --> 00:02:35,540
it but it felt so wrong again and I

58
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:40,010
asked myself what's wrong with me after

59
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:41,510
a long journey and different jobs I

60
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:41,959
quitted

61
00:02:41,959 --> 00:02:44,900
I started studying and within my time at

62
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:46,730
university I found the Open Text school

63
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:49,250
and joined the programming workshops the

64
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:50,180
open takes care is a nonprofit

65
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:52,340
organization who teaches people how to

66
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:55,489
code and in my case it was HTML CSS and

67
00:02:55,489 --> 00:02:59,060
also JavaScript for beginners it was the

68
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:00,829
first time in my life that I belonged to

69
00:03:00,829 --> 00:03:03,049
a group of people and they accepted me

70
00:03:03,049 --> 00:03:05,150
for who I am and gave me a good feeling

71
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:07,790
about switching my careers and become a

72
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:10,819
front-end developer they told everyone

73
00:03:10,819 --> 00:03:14,359
there you belong here and Here I am at

74
00:03:14,359 --> 00:03:16,909
EJ's computer patch as a Defra and also

75
00:03:16,909 --> 00:03:18,650
a front-end they'll work I'm very happy

76
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:20,150
that a lot of people from the open tech

77
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:23,540
school are still in my life since I'm a

78
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:25,159
front-end developer I get in touch with

79
00:03:25,159 --> 00:03:27,260
awesome talented people and I was

80
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:29,090
thrilled about how fast you can learn

81
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:31,629
how to build a website with HTML and CSS

82
00:03:31,629 --> 00:03:34,310
my love incur a learning curve was like

83
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:38,329
this you see the period of time and the

84
00:03:38,329 --> 00:03:40,579
things I've learned and it was an

85
00:03:40,579 --> 00:03:43,459
amazing feeling to learn so much in this

86
00:03:43,459 --> 00:03:47,629
short period of time but after couple of

87
00:03:47,629 --> 00:03:51,139
month it was like this the feeling

88
00:03:51,139 --> 00:03:53,510
stepping on the same spot was horrible I

89
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:55,639
compared myself to the people I've met

90
00:03:55,639 --> 00:03:58,430
and it feels like I'm absolutely stupid

91
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:01,280
it was hard to leave the comfort zone

92
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,620
and tasked with new program and stuff

93
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:06,530
overwhelmed me very fast and at least I

94
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:08,840
try to get tasks who were very easy for

95
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:11,349
me and I would things I have no idea of

96
00:04:11,349 --> 00:04:14,930
gives me the feeling I have no idea what

97
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:16,909
I'm doing here and I do not belong here

98
00:04:16,909 --> 00:04:20,090
I started to work harder on my own

99
00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:22,940
skills when I came back from home I sat

100
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:25,219
down at my desk and try to solve the

101
00:04:25,219 --> 00:04:27,360
programming problems I had during the

102
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,650
and my day was like eight hours of work

103
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:35,310
at work for up to six hours at work at

104
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:39,479
home and nightmares about work at night

105
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:42,000
and it doesn't work out and I just

106
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,560
talked about it with a friend of mine

107
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:46,830
and he was like what's wrong everything

108
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:48,330
is awesome you're doing a great job

109
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:50,310
you've achieved so much in this short

110
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:52,819
period of time and it feels like this

111
00:04:52,819 --> 00:04:55,469
everyone is better than me I'm never

112
00:04:55,469 --> 00:04:58,770
good enough and I'm overwhelmed I told

113
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:00,840
him but he still was like it's only in

114
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,849
your head stop worrying you're doing

115
00:05:02,849 --> 00:05:03,509
great

116
00:05:03,509 --> 00:05:06,270
I started researching where my doubts

117
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:09,419
are coming from and I just stumbled over

118
00:05:09,419 --> 00:05:11,310
a book blog post about the impostor

119
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:13,590
syndrome and I was only scratching on

120
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:15,090
the surface what the impostor syndrome

121
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:18,900
is about and read a lot about it while

122
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:20,729
doing my research I found a lot of

123
00:05:20,729 --> 00:05:22,650
multiple-choice tests and the most asked

124
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:24,419
questions were maybe you can ask

125
00:05:24,419 --> 00:05:27,050
yourself right now if you would like to

126
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:30,750
that's everyone overestimates you hell

127
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:34,409
yes I get paid for a job and I think I

128
00:05:34,409 --> 00:05:36,870
do not know enough about it to get paid

129
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:39,300
for it so yes everyone is overestimating

130
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:43,979
me so yes do you tend to discuss

131
00:05:43,979 --> 00:05:46,710
yourself I was thinking about that and

132
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:50,250
every time I'm doing something new I'm

133
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:52,080
questioning is this the right thing

134
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,050
you're doing right now this the correct

135
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:58,139
path you go you're going right now it

136
00:05:58,139 --> 00:06:03,060
was like yes of course the next thing is

137
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:04,979
you compare your ability to those around

138
00:06:04,979 --> 00:06:06,479
you and think they are more intelligent

139
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:09,240
than you are as I mentioned I met a lot

140
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,759
of amazing talented and intelligent

141
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:14,069
people and I compare myself every time

142
00:06:14,069 --> 00:06:17,219
to those and when it comes at work to

143
00:06:17,219 --> 00:06:19,229
some coding discussions and I'm sitting

144
00:06:19,229 --> 00:06:21,150
there like this oh my god what they are

145
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:25,050
right now I have no idea so yes I think

146
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:27,089
everyone else is more intelligent than

147
00:06:27,089 --> 00:06:30,629
me that's the fear of failure freaks you

148
00:06:30,629 --> 00:06:32,279
out hell yes

149
00:06:32,279 --> 00:06:35,069
last week I organized the conference and

150
00:06:35,069 --> 00:06:38,430
on Friday I heated by Coleman I was

151
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:41,129
terrified of fear well

152
00:06:41,129 --> 00:06:43,229
this conference work out do I have

153
00:06:43,229 --> 00:06:45,419
everything there what my speakers need

154
00:06:45,419 --> 00:06:47,129
the attendants need and I was freaking

155
00:06:47,129 --> 00:06:49,259
out so yes the fear of failure freaks me

156
00:06:49,259 --> 00:06:50,959
the hell out of me

157
00:06:50,959 --> 00:06:55,649
do you decline your own success yes one

158
00:06:55,649 --> 00:06:57,869
more time my conference what

159
00:06:57,869 --> 00:06:59,939
Sunday in the evening I was thinking

160
00:06:59,939 --> 00:07:02,249
there have a have a cup of coffee and

161
00:07:02,249 --> 00:07:04,319
everyone was like oh my god it was so

162
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:06,059
cool it was nice to meet you it was a

163
00:07:06,059 --> 00:07:09,719
cool conference I was like I see what

164
00:07:09,719 --> 00:07:12,419
went wrong so it was not that good as

165
00:07:12,419 --> 00:07:15,059
you see as you say to me so yes I

166
00:07:15,059 --> 00:07:17,990
declare my own use my own success

167
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:20,669
the next thing sometimes you afraid

168
00:07:20,669 --> 00:07:22,619
others will discover how much knowledge

169
00:07:22,619 --> 00:07:25,229
you really lack it's the same thing I

170
00:07:25,229 --> 00:07:27,409
told you before when it come up to

171
00:07:27,409 --> 00:07:30,479
calling discussions at work I should

172
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:32,399
shut my mouth because I'm afraid that

173
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:35,069
someone will tell me oh no no no you're

174
00:07:35,069 --> 00:07:36,659
not right and that's lack of knowledge

175
00:07:36,659 --> 00:07:41,219
so next point yes you are only

176
00:07:41,219 --> 00:07:43,619
successful because you were on the right

177
00:07:43,619 --> 00:07:46,079
time at the right place are you only

178
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:49,019
knew the right people yes of course I'm

179
00:07:49,019 --> 00:07:51,869
only I could only stand here because I

180
00:07:51,869 --> 00:07:54,240
met the people of the RTS of the open

181
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,439
tech school so absolutely you can't

182
00:07:58,439 --> 00:08:00,419
understand the compliments you receive

183
00:08:00,419 --> 00:08:03,329
hell yes that's the most annoying thing

184
00:08:03,329 --> 00:08:05,309
I have got in my life I can't understand

185
00:08:05,309 --> 00:08:06,899
some compliments I received I'm

186
00:08:06,899 --> 00:08:09,269
discussing them the whole time and I

187
00:08:09,269 --> 00:08:14,269
make me myself as tiny as I can so yes

188
00:08:14,269 --> 00:08:17,129
you feel bad when you're not the best or

189
00:08:17,129 --> 00:08:19,919
at least very special I have to think

190
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:23,610
about that again but it's not that worse

191
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:27,149
for me but at least I try to be the best

192
00:08:27,149 --> 00:08:29,279
and I can get very angry of myself when

193
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:32,399
I'm not very special sometimes or I'm

194
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:35,370
not the best so yeah it works out for me

195
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:39,300
as well you avoid evaluations if

196
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:41,069
possible and have a dread of others

197
00:08:41,069 --> 00:08:45,120
evaluations evaluating you evaluations

198
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,189
can be horrible especially when it came

199
00:08:47,189 --> 00:08:49,490
to the point where I have to elevate if

200
00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:53,220
evaluate other people and my opinion I'm

201
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:54,190
not skilled enough to

202
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:55,810
how people how good about that job was

203
00:08:55,810 --> 00:08:59,860
so yes do you focus more on what you

204
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:04,030
haven't done I think yeah I'm

205
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:07,030
questioning myself again and again did I

206
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:09,160
organized everything as everything there

207
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:11,380
for my speakers this my talk right now

208
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:13,330
am I prepared for my talk right now so

209
00:09:13,330 --> 00:09:17,440
I'm focusing I didn't do a dry run today

210
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,450
in the morning so why didn't I do that

211
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:22,600
and this is why what I was focusing on

212
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:25,560
and in the in the speaker room so yes

213
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:29,770
whoo 10 points to Gryffindor but well

214
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:32,260
now now I know that I'm suffering from

215
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:34,540
something I have no real idea about and

216
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:36,640
this was the time where I started to

217
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:37,930
take a deep dive and through the

218
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:40,150
imposter thing and I figured out why

219
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:41,890
reading all the blog posts and papers

220
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:45,940
what I'm doing to myself I sabotage

221
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:50,170
myself let that sink in I have immense

222
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:52,480
fear of failure but at the same time I'm

223
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,210
terrified of success and I want to prove

224
00:09:55,210 --> 00:09:57,700
my worth but I worry I don't deserve the

225
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:02,260
success of compliments I receive and not

226
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:05,980
likely to ask for a race since I don't

227
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,900
see myself as competent I don't think

228
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:12,730
I'm worth more money so and people like

229
00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:15,100
me to turn tend to work really hard as

230
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:17,350
mentioned before I said high standards

231
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:19,240
for myself and try my best to reach them

232
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:21,610
but no matter how much validation I

233
00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:24,760
receive I've never felt competent too

234
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:26,830
long didn't listen it's the thinking

235
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:28,090
that makes me believe I'm actually

236
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:30,840
incompetent and intelligent and lazy I'm

237
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:33,220
convinced that I'm convinced that I'm

238
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:35,110
faking my way through my accomplishments

239
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:37,839
and it's the fear I will be exposed at

240
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:40,900
the fraud I believe I am when I figured

241
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:42,640
out all the things I started thinking

242
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,140
about how to stop it in my head

243
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:47,080
some people think I'm worth my money and

244
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:50,140
some people think that I belong here so

245
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:53,170
I could not be that bad I think so I

246
00:10:53,170 --> 00:10:55,690
started researching again researching

247
00:10:55,690 --> 00:10:58,870
assisting for me so while doing research

248
00:10:58,870 --> 00:11:01,270
Alliance some techniques which helps me

249
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:03,730
to escape the bed zone and accept the

250
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:05,940
fact that it's not at worse as it seems

251
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:08,030
you will never be able

252
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:10,100
to get rid of it completely but it you

253
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:13,220
can make it feel less bad and before I

254
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:14,660
will talk about the techniques I

255
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:17,360
discovered over the time I would like to

256
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,490
show you a saying which describes why I

257
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:24,620
struggled so much in my life the reasons

258
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:26,750
we struggle with insecurity is because

259
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:28,970
we compare our behind the scenes with

260
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:32,480
everyone else's highlight reel this one

261
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,940
was right in the fields I was comparing

262
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:37,400
myself the whole time with other people

263
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,960
and when I read that quote I realized

264
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:41,260
that I was barking up the wrong tree

265
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:44,090
Facebook is the best example to see the

266
00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:46,520
highlights real of everyone holiday

267
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:50,240
photos some nice dish then photos with

268
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,160
the significant other where everyone is

269
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,170
laughing and only have a great time and

270
00:11:54,170 --> 00:11:56,390
you're sitting then ask yourself why do

271
00:11:56,390 --> 00:11:59,810
they have such a awesome life and you're

272
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:02,000
sitting here on your desk and sobbing in

273
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,420
worries all the time now I've got the

274
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:07,840
quote in my in my phone in my notes and

275
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,980
when I'm thinking about that everyone

276
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:12,170
else is living a better life than me I

277
00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:15,070
only read that it makes me feel better

278
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:18,940
and maybe it helps you too

279
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:23,060
so stop comparing yourself to others you

280
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:25,190
an individual and you're worth every

281
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:25,790
penny

282
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:28,850
or compliment you receive having idols

283
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:31,400
is a good thing but they are not you

284
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,620
they are not walking in your shoes and

285
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:35,510
they've made different experiences as

286
00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:38,810
you and maybe they think that they are

287
00:12:38,810 --> 00:12:41,030
frauds - you don't know you only see the

288
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:43,370
good Facebook post on social media and

289
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:46,820
you aren't born to live a life of

290
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:49,990
another person you as perfect as you are

291
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:52,430
next thing is everything is only in your

292
00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:55,220
hat people who are working with you will

293
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:57,380
acknowledge your work they appreciate

294
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:59,060
you as the person who you are and they

295
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:01,510
will tell you when something went wrong

296
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:03,710
except the compliments you receive

297
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:05,870
because people are criticized faster

298
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:10,610
instead of praising you and imposes try

299
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:12,920
to be perfect when something is not

300
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:16,550
perfect it's not properly done right so

301
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:19,880
learn to be a healthy perfectionist most

302
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,820
things are done the product better than

303
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:23,800
effect and stop worrying excessively

304
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:26,860
about mistakes or setbacks sometimes you

305
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:29,980
have to ask yourself what would I do if

306
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:33,190
I was not afraid I asked myself in the

307
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:35,470
last few weeks would I ask my boss for a

308
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:35,950
raise

309
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:38,520
ask the cute person in front of me out

310
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:41,890
start a new project and there are a lot

311
00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:44,200
of questions you can ask yourself like

312
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,360
in the same way when the fear kicks in

313
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:49,600
and if this doesn't work out for you ask

314
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,700
the right people to help you out with

315
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:55,600
your problem learn to ask for advice it

316
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,100
can be really hard in the beginning but

317
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:59,440
a lot of people are really happy to help

318
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,140
you out you don't have to prove that you

319
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:04,660
can solve every problem on your own

320
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:08,500
I started mentoring people in August and

321
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:11,650
September and at least I was a mentor at

322
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:13,840
two events right now and guess what

323
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,970
people will ask questions you cannot

324
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:18,060
answer and you cannot answer them but

325
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:20,800
that's good you don't know you don't

326
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,200
have to know everything Stack Overflow

327
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,390
or documentation can be your best

328
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:28,810
friends and it's a good thing to know

329
00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:32,500
what you don't know is that's still not

330
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:35,500
enough to overcome the bad feelings talk

331
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,840
about it if you want to I'm helping

332
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,670
myself right now when I'm talking about

333
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:43,840
it maybe you're not into speaking to a

334
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:46,600
huge crowd like me right now but it

335
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,520
helps you to keep you aware that he was

336
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:52,030
suffering from something and especially

337
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:54,760
your friends can be really supportive

338
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:56,500
and help you out with your problem you

339
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:59,710
only have one thing to do bribe your

340
00:14:59,710 --> 00:15:02,770
friends every time one of your friends

341
00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:04,690
point out that you're under estimating

342
00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:07,360
yourself spend them a cup of coffee or

343
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:10,450
maybe a beer but one thing I can tell

344
00:15:10,450 --> 00:15:12,370
you it can be very expensive in the

345
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:14,620
beginning and maybe you should switch to

346
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:18,790
water and and some tea because your

347
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:20,170
friends will suffer from too much

348
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:22,300
caffeine or beer and with tea and water

349
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:24,040
they only have to pee a lot so that's

350
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:29,410
fine being wrong or not perfect doesn't

351
00:15:29,410 --> 00:15:32,380
make you a fraud just keep in mind the

352
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:35,400
best circuit teams lose but

353
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,080
they are not frauds they know how to

354
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:39,990
kick the ball right oh there are many

355
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:42,240
million dollar companies that sometimes

356
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,660
fail as well evaluate the impact or what

357
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:47,760
could go wrong by asking yourself what's

358
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,920
the worst thing that can happen to me

359
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,800
right now this will help to elevate the

360
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,840
fear and the most things we're doing

361
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:56,330
happen I have not a huge impact

362
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:58,920
especially in tech we create software

363
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:00,810
for customers and maybe they are not

364
00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:02,820
amused about a missed deadline but hey

365
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:04,580
we're humans not machines

366
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:06,900
we should start focusing on providing

367
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:09,870
value and write down your achievements

368
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:12,810
of the day this one is out of my

369
00:16:12,810 --> 00:16:15,420
sketchbook at home and it's a smallest

370
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:18,030
for me from the last week I helped out

371
00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:20,130
an elderly person to enter the tray to

372
00:16:20,130 --> 00:16:21,960
enter the train I organized the

373
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:24,030
conference on my own I teach my

374
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:26,490
colleagues something I know I cooked a

375
00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:27,810
really delicious meal for me and my

376
00:16:27,810 --> 00:16:29,850
friends I denote a really good part of

377
00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:32,910
code and this can be written down in a

378
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:35,160
diary only at a Google Doc it's up to

379
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,990
you where you write it down especially

380
00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:40,560
the small things matter - like those

381
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,800
ones keep a file of nice things someone

382
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:46,650
was saying about you can you remember

383
00:16:46,650 --> 00:16:48,870
the last time when you received a

384
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:51,240
compliment and know exactly the wording

385
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:53,840
no me neither

386
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:57,090
we forgotten too often the good parts in

387
00:16:57,090 --> 00:16:58,590
life and this is why you should take

388
00:16:58,590 --> 00:17:00,630
maybe screenshots and save them when

389
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:02,570
someone writes something good about you

390
00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:04,950
make notes in your phone when someone

391
00:17:04,950 --> 00:17:07,050
gives you an awesome compliment take a

392
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:08,490
look at it when you're feeling like a

393
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:12,120
fraud and what helps me the most stop

394
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:15,330
commenting compliments really just stop

395
00:17:15,330 --> 00:17:17,130
it never do this again

396
00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:19,560
just stop it I was a person who was

397
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:21,450
discussing my saw my other compliments

398
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:23,610
every time and it helped me a lot to

399
00:17:23,610 --> 00:17:26,010
appreciate myself and the work I was

400
00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:28,140
doing when I stopped commenting on

401
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:30,600
compliments if the sender a friendly

402
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,840
smile and say thank you for that and

403
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:35,850
before your thoughts start spinning take

404
00:17:35,850 --> 00:17:36,990
a look at what you've done for the

405
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:38,600
person which gives you the compliment

406
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:41,010
ask yourself what the person give me a

407
00:17:41,010 --> 00:17:42,810
compliment if my work was as bad as I

408
00:17:42,810 --> 00:17:47,160
think yes answer is no in 99% and the

409
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:49,190
other 1% of people we would not like to

410
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:52,940
about the last thing is take time for

411
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:55,880
yourself if everything feels horrible

412
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:58,820
and me and you are freaking out on the

413
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:01,670
inside do what you enjoy the most for me

414
00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:03,920
it's like taking a hot bath or grab a

415
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:06,290
good book have some quality time for

416
00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:10,280
myself come down from the day and forget

417
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:12,200
for a short period of time the cold

418
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:15,590
feeling if you're freaking out in your

419
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:17,450
office maybe get a cup of tea take a

420
00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:20,780
break do sit-ups tap the office dock

421
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:23,570
maybe whatever works out for you to calm

422
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:26,900
down let's start over with the good

423
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:30,320
parts of being an impostor and you think

424
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:34,520
maybe now wait what she was telling us

425
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:37,100
the whole time that she suffers from it

426
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:38,800
and now there are good parts of it

427
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:41,390
sometimes it's not that bad to suffer

428
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:44,270
from the imposter syndrome to be an

429
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:47,300
overachiever is not that bad at least we

430
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:49,040
try to be as perfect as possible and

431
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:52,400
everything we do so from time to time we

432
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,740
have to take a step back calm down and

433
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:57,410
live with the result which is maybe not

434
00:18:57,410 --> 00:18:59,930
the perfect solution but if we can

435
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:01,880
accept it that we don't have to be

436
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,770
perfect that's not that bad to be an

437
00:19:03,770 --> 00:19:08,090
overachiever do you know people who

438
00:19:08,090 --> 00:19:09,590
think they are the best and everything

439
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:12,230
they doing and after a few sentences you

440
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:15,680
you talk to them you think they're not

441
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:18,470
the brightest candle on the cake those

442
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:20,120
people are in my opinion very annoying

443
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:22,160
and this is why I think when you

444
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,260
underestimate yourself from time to time

445
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:25,820
and promote it to the people it's not

446
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:28,340
that bad it's better to surprise the

447
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:30,350
people with what you've done and

448
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:32,180
achieved instead of disappointing them

449
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:34,220
with what they've expected from you

450
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:37,630
because you're overestimated yourself

451
00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:40,850
maybe you're not suffering from the

452
00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:43,880
imposter syndrome but after hearing the

453
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:46,430
symptoms you're asking yourself I think

454
00:19:46,430 --> 00:19:48,050
a friend of mine is suffering from the

455
00:19:48,050 --> 00:19:50,890
impostor syndrome what can I do

456
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:52,760
maybe someone tells you that they

457
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:55,130
feeling like a fraud faking everything

458
00:19:55,130 --> 00:19:57,110
are they not good enough for the money

459
00:19:57,110 --> 00:19:59,810
they get and you should not say hey I

460
00:19:59,810 --> 00:20:02,220
was last week at the jeaious computer

461
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:04,049
just listen to a talk about the imposter

462
00:20:04,049 --> 00:20:05,970
syndrome you ain't imposed to deal with

463
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:09,870
it don't do that to anyone they will

464
00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:12,240
start researching like me and spend a

465
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,770
lot of time with it because the first

466
00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:16,590
blog post I read had the title you the

467
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:21,030
imposter and I was like oh wow and the

468
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:22,740
worrying journey kicks in really badly

469
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:26,309
don't do that to anyone instead of

470
00:20:26,309 --> 00:20:27,659
telling them that they are suffering

471
00:20:27,659 --> 00:20:31,289
give them reasonable feedback maybe a

472
00:20:31,289 --> 00:20:32,640
colleague of you is questioning

473
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,530
themselves the whole time and ask is

474
00:20:34,530 --> 00:20:38,460
this okay what I'm doing or maybe can

475
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:40,110
you take a look at my code again please

476
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:42,210
and this more frequently than other

477
00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:45,780
colleagues do take your time and explain

478
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:47,010
them that the work is good and

479
00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:51,419
especially explain them the why maybe

480
00:20:51,419 --> 00:20:54,030
the work is not perfect but you Kevin it

481
00:20:54,030 --> 00:20:55,919
can tell them too that they can improve

482
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:59,039
here and there something but also with

483
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:02,250
the Y complimenting people only because

484
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:04,860
of the fears is not really helpful don't

485
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:08,039
compliment them only make only to make

486
00:21:08,039 --> 00:21:10,230
them feel better explain them the why

487
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:12,450
you think like this and the why is the

488
00:21:12,450 --> 00:21:15,000
most important thing but you can also

489
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,490
help them with if you talk about your

490
00:21:17,490 --> 00:21:20,220
own fears if you feel uncomfortable with

491
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:22,110
it show the people that they are not

492
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:24,330
along with their problems maybe you're

493
00:21:24,330 --> 00:21:27,750
working at a project and you've got a

494
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:30,210
deadline and every one of you knows

495
00:21:30,210 --> 00:21:32,100
customers right they can get really

496
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:33,960
angry when you have to say oh my god no

497
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,520
in the end of the week it will not work

498
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:38,039
out we need one another week so and

499
00:21:38,039 --> 00:21:42,120
there nope we pay for you so at least

500
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:43,679
deal with it in the end of the week of

501
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:46,470
the project have to be finished maybe

502
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:48,809
you can tell your colleague who may be

503
00:21:48,809 --> 00:21:50,760
suffering from the impostor syndrome oh

504
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:52,679
my god deadline in the end of the week

505
00:21:52,679 --> 00:21:54,360
of course I'm afraid something went

506
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:56,179
wrong when we deploy it to production

507
00:21:56,179 --> 00:21:59,669
are you using a new framework maybe

508
00:21:59,669 --> 00:22:03,690
react angular 1 Z J's whatever you can

509
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:05,940
say oh I've never done this before and

510
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:08,039
I'm also afraid of wool what will not

511
00:22:08,039 --> 00:22:09,240
work out in the end

512
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:11,370
shall the people they do not have to

513
00:22:11,370 --> 00:22:14,309
fight the battles alone to come to an

514
00:22:14,309 --> 00:22:15,840
end with this talk I would like to show

515
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:16,110
you

516
00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:19,020
beautiful phrase I heard while watching

517
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:22,350
Kung Fu Panda this phrase describes so

518
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:25,200
much how you escape the zone and what

519
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:29,280
you should focus on Okwe the turtle said

520
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,890
to the Panda you're too concerned with

521
00:22:31,890 --> 00:22:34,500
what was and what will be there's the

522
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:37,200
saying yes there is yesterday's history

523
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:40,320
tomorrow's a mystery but today is a gift

524
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:44,610
that's why it's called the present if we

525
00:22:44,610 --> 00:22:46,890
read over and over that saying thinks

526
00:22:46,890 --> 00:22:49,860
getting less bad we are thinking the

527
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:51,750
whole time what we've done wrong and

528
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:53,850
maybe we can see the opportunities we

529
00:22:53,850 --> 00:22:56,840
missed every day because of worrying

530
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:59,880
last but not least when we start over a

531
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:02,820
new job maybe ask ourselves was this the

532
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:05,610
right decision job offers do not cover

533
00:23:05,610 --> 00:23:07,620
everything we are able to do contain

534
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:10,020
things we've never done but we are

535
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:12,030
applying for this job because every job

536
00:23:12,030 --> 00:23:15,059
offers nearly the same right but there's

537
00:23:15,059 --> 00:23:17,100
never be a perfect fit for everyone and

538
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:19,830
this is why I would like to say to you

539
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:22,559
to be an imposter is not the exception

540
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:25,020
it's a rule and everyone suffers from it

541
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:28,500
from time to time thank you

542
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:30,180
[Applause]
