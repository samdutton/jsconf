00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:32,710

guten morgen je s comfy you so today as

2
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:34,329
our nook said I'm going to talk about

3
00:00:34,329 --> 00:00:36,519
things but I think I know what you're

4
00:00:36,519 --> 00:00:40,520
talking about but I'm not quite sure

5
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:45,960
so I'm Jen I'm a front-end developer I

6
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:48,610
am currently a software out of our

7
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:50,409
software engineer at Eventbrite as an

8
00:00:50,409 --> 00:00:53,430
oak said and you may know me as the

9
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:56,710
creator of human wasteland also known as

10
00:00:56,710 --> 00:00:58,720
the poop map particularly those of you

11
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:02,229
from the Bay Area you may also know me

12
00:01:02,229 --> 00:01:04,360
as the creator of developers developers

13
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:06,790
which is a project I recently created as

14
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:12,250
a dedication to mr. Steve Ballmer but

15
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:13,960
all of that is just a long-winded way of

16
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:19,010
saying that I write code for a living

17
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:21,430
before we get started some quick

18
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:24,249
disclaimers there are going to be a lot

19
00:01:24,249 --> 00:01:27,999
of animated gifts in this talk and there

20
00:01:27,999 --> 00:01:31,899
may be a few errors so if you notice any

21
00:01:31,899 --> 00:01:34,270
of those errors before you start to feel

22
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:43,240
a little bit like this or a little bit

23
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:50,319
like this let's talk about it but come

24
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:56,560
and find me after my talk so let's go as

25
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,810
I said I'm a developer

26
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:03,990
software engineer programmer or whatever

27
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:06,840
else you might want to call me so some

28
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,360
days when I look at my computer this is

29
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:14,220
how I feel and I'm pretty sure many of

30
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:16,610
you can relate to that feeling and

31
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:19,140
sometimes when I'm in conversation with

32
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:20,310
other developers

33
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:28,470
I feel like this so Phil Carlson once

34
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:31,260
said there are two only two hard things

35
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:34,470
in computer science cache and validation

36
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:38,340
and naming things and we can see that in

37
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:41,760
the many various complicated terms in

38
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,819
computer science and web development so

39
00:02:44,819 --> 00:02:47,519
here is just a general sampling of some

40
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:49,019
of the words I've come across in my

41
00:02:49,019 --> 00:02:52,260
career as a programmer and oftentimes I

42
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:53,940
hear them and I'm like they're a little

43
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:56,819
bit familiar I think I know what you're

44
00:02:56,819 --> 00:02:59,310
talking about but I'm not really sure

45
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:02,010
and so in those conversations I often

46
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:04,019
ask people can you explain that word to

47
00:03:04,019 --> 00:03:06,209
me and in doing so I get a look like

48
00:03:06,209 --> 00:03:10,980
this and when I get that look from other

49
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:19,290
people it makes me feel like this so

50
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:20,850
again these words are very complicated

51
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:23,760
they have very checkered pasts they have

52
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,190
very interesting history they come from

53
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:28,440
all different places and so today I'm

54
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,569
going to go over a few of those terms so

55
00:03:30,569 --> 00:03:32,130
when you hear them in conversation

56
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:33,750
perhaps you'll feel a little bit less

57
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:37,709
like this and you'll feel a little bit

58
00:03:37,709 --> 00:03:45,480
more like this yeah Brent grambo all

59
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,609
right so first up is parameter versus

60
00:03:47,609 --> 00:03:50,250
argument what's the difference is there

61
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:54,000
one so to find out I of course went to

62
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,190
Google and when I search parameter

63
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:57,780
argument you'll see many people are

64
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:59,010
wondering about the difference between

65
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:00,989
the two because you can see it's the

66
00:04:00,989 --> 00:04:03,530
third query down that's auto-filled

67
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:07,650
so here I've written a function it's

68
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:10,860
called shark and I call shark at the

69
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:14,710
very bottom with the string left

70
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:18,389
so how many people in the audience think

71
00:04:18,389 --> 00:04:22,440
that the parameter is that first in that

72
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:26,660
first line slot the side raise your hand

73
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:29,910
and how many people think it is the

74
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:32,220
string left in the bottom line of this

75
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:34,800
code raise your hand and obviously I'm

76
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,970
raising my hand both times so you guys

77
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:39,600
don't know all right well I'm not gonna

78
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,139
tell you but I'm gonna keep going

79
00:04:42,139 --> 00:04:45,270
so parameter and the online etymology

80
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:47,550
dictionary and etymology is essentially

81
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:50,070
the history of words says that parameter

82
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:53,310
is a measurable factor which helps to

83
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:56,130
define a particular system and when I

84
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:58,290
read that I'm like oh okay I think I

85
00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:01,350
know which one is the parameter now but

86
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:03,600
I keep going and when I search argument

87
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,400
on the online etymology dictionary I

88
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:08,070
find that there's just information about

89
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:10,020
people arguing with each other so I'm

90
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:11,370
like well that doesn't explain to me

91
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:14,940
what an argument is then so I keep going

92
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:16,979
and I check out computer programming on

93
00:05:16,979 --> 00:05:20,070
Wikipedia and here I see that the term

94
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:22,500
parameter sometimes called the formal

95
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:25,380
parameter is often used to refer to the

96
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:27,270
variable as found in the function

97
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:29,910
definition while argument sometimes

98
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:32,400
called the actual parameter refers to

99
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,099
the actual input passed and because I'm

100
00:05:35,099 --> 00:05:37,830
a developer Mike okay this definition

101
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:41,520
makes sense to me but I wonder why

102
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,500
didn't we stick with the terms formal

103
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:46,410
parameter and actual parameter and to

104
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:48,389
find that out we've got to go down the

105
00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:54,270
rabbit hole so I look up mathematics I

106
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:56,220
search parameter and argument in

107
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:58,710
mathematics on Wikipedia and I find that

108
00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:01,770
a function definition can also contain

109
00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:04,110
parameters but unlike variables

110
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:06,419
parameters are not listed among the

111
00:06:06,419 --> 00:06:09,539
arguments that the function takes now

112
00:06:09,539 --> 00:06:12,870
Mike what does that mean Wikipedia like

113
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:16,380
please go on so we see here that the

114
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:18,900
variable X designates the functions

115
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:21,780
argument but a B and C are the

116
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:24,210
parameters so I look at this quadratic

117
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:26,439
function and I see that

118
00:06:26,439 --> 00:06:30,189
X is the argument and a B and C are the

119
00:06:30,189 --> 00:06:33,039
parameters and I was like wait wait a

120
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:35,860
second so I have a math function up on

121
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:37,989
top and we see that a is the parameter

122
00:06:37,989 --> 00:06:40,689
then I have a computer science or a

123
00:06:40,689 --> 00:06:43,149
function of JavaScript and I see that

124
00:06:43,149 --> 00:06:46,289
bar is the parameter and like whoa

125
00:06:46,289 --> 00:06:50,069
that's totally messing me up right now

126
00:06:50,069 --> 00:06:54,849
so the way I explain it is that this

127
00:06:54,849 --> 00:06:59,169
Bulldog is a parameter computer science

128
00:06:59,169 --> 00:07:03,189
is the football and so as soon as a

129
00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:06,429
parameter hits computer science its

130
00:07:06,429 --> 00:07:07,929
definition just gets flipped completely

131
00:07:07,929 --> 00:07:16,620
on its end

132
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:19,400
so the takeaway here for me is actually

133
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,110
that parameters help define a function

134
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:23,690
and arguments are passed into a function

135
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:26,900
but that's only in computer science so

136
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:29,390
here's our answer the parameter is up on

137
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:31,700
top and shark in the function definition

138
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:35,090
and then the argument is down at the

139
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:36,620
bottom that's string last in the

140
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:39,620
function call and all of that being said

141
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:41,990
we just use parameter and argument

142
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:45,590
interchangeably anyways so that was easy

143
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:53,240
right all right next up is scope so I

144
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,010
don't know about all of you but when

145
00:07:55,010 --> 00:07:57,440
somebody asks me to talk about scope I'm

146
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,450
like I don't want to talk about scope

147
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:02,060
please don't make me talk about scope

148
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:08,210
but I'm gonna talk about it today so

149
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:10,370
first up is lexical scoping and of

150
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:12,560
course I go back to Google and I see

151
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,440
that lexical scoping parentheses

152
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:18,230
sometimes known as static scoping is a

153
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:20,630
convention used with many programming

154
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:23,390
languages that sets the scope or range

155
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:25,790
of functionality of a variable so that

156
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:28,580
it may be only be called or referenced

157
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:30,800
from within the block of code in which

158
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:38,690
it is defined so that definition has

159
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:41,780
three different equivalent definitions

160
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:44,420
just within it so they say that lexical

161
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:46,490
scoping is equivalent to static scoping

162
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:49,370
scope is related to or is equivalent to

163
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:51,770
range of functionality and called is

164
00:08:51,770 --> 00:08:54,890
equivalent to reference were stop what's

165
00:08:54,890 --> 00:08:56,660
the worst of all is they actually use

166
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:59,120
the term scope in the definition of

167
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,390
lexical scoping so let's break it down a

168
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:06,440
little bit scope in the online etymology

169
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:10,430
dictionary is an aim purpose object

170
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:15,080
thing aimed at mark or target and am I

171
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,370
can have that doesn't really explain it

172
00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:18,050
in computer science for me so let's keep

173
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:21,860
going so I search scope on Wikipedia and

174
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:24,380
I see that a scope is a part of a

175
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:25,490
program that is

176
00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:28,490
or can be the scope for a set of

177
00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:32,090
bindings a precise definition is tricky

178
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:38,090
see below

179
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:42,430
okay thanks a lot Wikipedia I guess I'll

180
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:45,580
see below so below I see that in

181
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:48,100
computer programming the scope of a name

182
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:51,640
binding an association of a name to an

183
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:54,820
entity such as a variable is the part of

184
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:56,950
a computer program where the binding is

185
00:09:56,950 --> 00:09:59,650
valid where the name can be used to

186
00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:02,470
refer to the entity and I'm like well

187
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:04,300
that makes sense to me because I know

188
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:06,790
what scope is already but somebody who's

189
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:08,620
new to programming may come and read

190
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:10,750
this and be like I don't really know

191
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:12,550
what you're talking about and so when I

192
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:14,590
read this I'm like it's an okay

193
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:18,640
definition so I keep going same article

194
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:21,460
on scope in Wikipedia and then they say

195
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:24,070
the strict definition of lexical scope

196
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:26,980
of a name or identifier is unambiguous

197
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:29,440
and like thanks a lot Wikipedia you're

198
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:33,400
so condescending it's unambiguous but it

199
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,980
says that it is quote the portion of

200
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:38,230
source code in which a binding of a name

201
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:41,830
with an entity applies and I'm like okay

202
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:43,870
that makes sense to me it's pretty short

203
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:47,710
and sweet and I keep reading and I see

204
00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:49,780
that it has been virtually unchanged

205
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:52,270
from its 1960 definition in the

206
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:55,300
specification of Algol 60 and I don't

207
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:57,820
know about y'all but when I saw Algol 60

208
00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:01,150
it was like I don't know what that is

209
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:04,360
so Algol 60 is short for algorithmic

210
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:07,480
language of 1960 and alwal 60 was the

211
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:09,220
first language implementing nested

212
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:11,410
function definitions with lexical scope

213
00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:14,740
and I was like wait so we've had the

214
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:18,010
definition of lexical scope since 1960

215
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:20,950
and it's still so hard to explain to

216
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:26,800
other people but moving on so let's talk

217
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:30,190
about lexical versus dynamic scope so

218
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:32,140
lexical scope is the main focus of that

219
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:34,900
Wikipedia article with dynamic scope

220
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:37,060
understood by contrast with lexical

221
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:39,130
scope so I read this and I'm like really

222
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:41,470
like I have to know what lexical scope

223
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:43,170
is first before you can even define

224
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:48,970
dynamic scope for me

225
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:51,540
all right so let's get a little bit

226
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:54,750
deeper so lexical on the online

227
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:57,180
etymology dictionary means pertaining to

228
00:11:57,180 --> 00:12:02,310
words I like huh okay what about dynamic

229
00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:06,120
and dynamic means pertaining to force

230
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,950
producing motion or the opposite of

231
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:09,840
static and I was like oh that's pretty

232
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,670
interesting because at first definition

233
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:15,000
of lexical scoping on Google said that

234
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,230
lexical scoping is also static scoping

235
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:21,930
so I keep going and look up more about

236
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:25,650
the scope on Wikipedia again and for

237
00:12:25,650 --> 00:12:28,020
most programming languages part of a

238
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:30,390
program refers to a portion of the

239
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:33,240
source code or area of texts and is

240
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:35,640
known as lexical scope like oh okay

241
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:37,170
that's where pertaining the words comes

242
00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:39,690
from and then in some languages however

243
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:42,360
part of a program refers to the quote

244
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:45,150
portion of run time or time period

245
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:47,610
during execution and that's known as

246
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:50,820
dynamic scope and then I keep reading

247
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:53,850
below and I see both of these terms are

248
00:12:53,850 --> 00:12:54,990
somewhat misleading

249
00:12:54,990 --> 00:12:58,590
oh my goal and I keep reading they

250
00:12:58,590 --> 00:13:01,230
misuse technical terms as discussed in

251
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:03,570
the definition then I go so what I just

252
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:06,420
read is wrong and then I keep reading

253
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:08,520
that says but the distinction itself is

254
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:10,620
accurate and precise and these are the

255
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:13,830
standard respective terms like oh so

256
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:17,670
what I just read was right okay so I

257
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:21,030
keep reading again of course and we see

258
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:23,250
that in practice with lexical scope a

259
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:25,650
variables definition is resolved by

260
00:13:25,650 --> 00:13:27,570
searching its containing block or

261
00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:30,150
function then if that fails searching

262
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:32,330
the outer containing block and so on

263
00:13:32,330 --> 00:13:35,520
whereas with dynamic scope the calling

264
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,650
function is searched then the function

265
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,390
which called that calling function and

266
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:41,430
so on oh my go

267
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:44,490
that's that's pretty clear I think that

268
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:47,820
makes sense to me so all that being said

269
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:50,100
this is a JavaScript conference so who

270
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:54,030
cares about dynamic scope so the way I

271
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:57,449
like to think about lexical scope is

272
00:13:57,449 --> 00:14:02,559
the box is a function the orange cat is

273
00:14:02,559 --> 00:14:05,559
a variable in that function the orange

274
00:14:05,559 --> 00:14:08,619
cat can see the white cat but the white

275
00:14:08,619 --> 00:14:18,970
cat can't see the orange cat

276
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:28,290
okay next up is recursion so recursion

277
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:29,640
on the online etymology dictionary

278
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:32,310
refers to a running backwards or to

279
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:36,149
return or to run back yeah like that

280
00:14:36,149 --> 00:14:38,040
kind of makes sense but not quite

281
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:41,279
related to computer science so I look up

282
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:43,830
recursion on Wikipedia and I read that

283
00:14:43,830 --> 00:14:45,899
the most common application of recursion

284
00:14:45,899 --> 00:14:48,420
is in mathematics and computer science

285
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:50,820
in which it refers to a method of

286
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:53,310
defining functions in which the function

287
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:55,950
being defined is applied within its own

288
00:14:55,950 --> 00:14:58,860
definition and I was like wait I thought

289
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:00,899
this was a definition why is why are we

290
00:15:00,899 --> 00:15:03,120
defining so many different definitions

291
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,940
within its definition so I keep reading

292
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:09,660
and I see that specifically this defines

293
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:12,360
an infinite number of instances or

294
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:15,029
function values using a finite

295
00:15:15,029 --> 00:15:18,209
expression that for some instances may

296
00:15:18,209 --> 00:15:21,300
refer to other instances and in such a

297
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:23,850
way that no loop or infinite chain of

298
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:29,940
references can occur

299
00:15:29,950 --> 00:15:32,530
let's keep going

300
00:15:32,530 --> 00:15:35,930
so I keep reading down this article and

301
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:37,520
I see that in mathematics and computer

302
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:40,190
science a class of objects or methods

303
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:42,650
exhibit recursive behavior when they can

304
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:44,840
be defined by two properties number one

305
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:47,000
a simple base case or cases a

306
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,130
terminating scenario that does not use

307
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:51,070
recursion to produce an answer and

308
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:54,080
number two a set of rules that reduce

309
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,970
all other cases toward that base case

310
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:59,360
and again that kind of makes sense to me

311
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,920
because I am a developer but for

312
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:02,630
somebody's who's new they probably are

313
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:04,970
gonna give me a look like this when they

314
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:09,380
read that so at its base I like to

315
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:11,870
describe recursion as a function that

316
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:14,660
calls itself that's what I would like to

317
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:17,780
see on Wikipedia instead so oftentimes

318
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:20,060
people will explain recursion to other

319
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:22,610
people by saying this and then they

320
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:24,170
decide to get a little bit more

321
00:16:24,170 --> 00:16:25,880
complicated and talk about the Fibonacci

322
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:29,660
sequence and I'm like oh god I took math

323
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:32,210
like over a decade ago I don't know

324
00:16:32,210 --> 00:16:34,670
about y'all but I see this and I'm like

325
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:36,350
I don't even remember what the Fibonacci

326
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:38,810
sequence is so when somebody starts to

327
00:16:38,810 --> 00:16:40,910
explain recursion to me by talking about

328
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:45,070
the Fibonacci sequence I'm like whatever

329
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:48,460
one time though a friend explains to me

330
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:51,100
recursion by talking about factorials

331
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:53,690
and I think everybody really likes

332
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:55,190
factorials because they have this cute

333
00:16:55,190 --> 00:16:57,800
little exclamation point and if you

334
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:00,230
remember them from more like elementary

335
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:02,720
or middle school mathematics and like oh

336
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:05,450
that makes a lot more sense and I really

337
00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:07,340
like that definition of recursion so

338
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:09,470
when somebody talks about that I feel a

339
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:11,600
lot more like this like yeah that's a

340
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:16,090
good example all right next is

341
00:17:16,090 --> 00:17:19,190
concatenation so concatenation on the

342
00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:21,470
online etymology dictionary refers to a

343
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:24,410
linking together to link together a

344
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:28,280
chain and I was like whoa we actually

345
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,960
use that word correctly in computer

346
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:34,280
science go us but really the true reason

347
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:35,630
I want to bring up this word is because

348
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:37,810
it's got cat in it

349
00:17:37,810 --> 00:17:41,770
and this is my cat everything's better

350
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:50,049
con cat and here's a recursive cat

351
00:17:50,059 --> 00:17:52,470
it's stuck in that infinite loop of a

352
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:54,299
function I don't know okay

353
00:17:54,299 --> 00:17:58,950
anyways next up is instantiate so

354
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:01,559
instantiate from the online etymology

355
00:18:01,559 --> 00:18:04,919
dictionary it comes from instant and it

356
00:18:04,919 --> 00:18:07,139
was created in 1946 and oh my god that's

357
00:18:07,139 --> 00:18:10,380
pretty recent actually and then i go to

358
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:11,490
google and i'm like what does

359
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:13,889
instantiate mean and it means to

360
00:18:13,889 --> 00:18:16,919
represent as or by an instance and their

361
00:18:16,919 --> 00:18:19,440
example is a study of two groups who

362
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,809
seem to instantiate productive aspects

363
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:28,440
of this this what as if this wasn't

364
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:33,520
confusing enough in JavaScript

365
00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:36,210
so in Wikipedia when I searched

366
00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:37,800
instantiation I actually come across

367
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:41,220
philosophy and it says that in predicate

368
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:44,250
logic Universal instantiation also known

369
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:49,100
as UI also called Universal

370
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:51,240
specification or Universal elimination

371
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:54,210
and sometimes confused with dictum dyani

372
00:18:54,210 --> 00:18:58,410
is a valid role of inference from a

373
00:18:58,410 --> 00:19:00,450
truth about each member of a class of

374
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:02,850
individuals to the truth about a

375
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:04,860
particular individual of that class

376
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:07,770
sounds like ok that kind of makes sense

377
00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:12,390
but basically all cats are mammals fry

378
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:15,180
as a cat and therefore fry as a mammal

379
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:17,520
so that's Universal Universal

380
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:21,120
instantiation and philosophy so here I

381
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,460
have a class that I've created called

382
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:27,900
mammal and a class that I've called cats

383
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:31,560
and I set the cat's prototype to mammal

384
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:35,940
and instantiate a new cat here called

385
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:36,690
fried cat

386
00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:40,320
so basically fry is the cat all cats are

387
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:43,560
mammals and so therefore fried cat is

388
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:48,180
also a mammal I was like cool another

389
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:49,980
good thing that we have correct in

390
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:53,880
computer science instantiation but

391
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:54,360
weirdly

392
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:56,840
the online etymology dictionary

393
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:59,820
instantiation actually redirects to

394
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:02,730
instantiate and on wikipedia instantiate

395
00:20:02,730 --> 00:20:06,600
redirects to instantiation so we only

396
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,700
have either the noun form or the verb

397
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:12,530
form you can't have both apparently

398
00:20:12,530 --> 00:20:17,100
anyways moving on to acronyms so here

399
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:20,150
are some acronyms I always get confused

400
00:20:20,150 --> 00:20:25,170
CRM CMS and CDN and just to go over them

401
00:20:25,170 --> 00:20:28,500
again because they're very confusing CRM

402
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:31,650
is a customer relationship manager kind

403
00:20:31,650 --> 00:20:35,640
of like salesforce a CMS is a content

404
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:38,550
management system it's kind of like

405
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:43,080
wordpress and a CDN is a content

406
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:45,660
delivery network kind of like Amazon

407
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:52,080
OUTFRONT next is SAS versus SAS when

408
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,270
you're talking about SAS please clarify

409
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:56,010
to me which one you are talking about

410
00:20:56,010 --> 00:20:58,500
are you talking about software as a

411
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:01,140
service like Salesforce or are you

412
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:02,820
talking about syntactically awesome

413
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:05,400
style sheets which is the CSS extension

414
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,410
language I don't know but if you don't

415
00:21:07,410 --> 00:21:09,210
tell me that I'm gonna get sassy about

416
00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:16,530
it next is Dom so there are many kinds

417
00:21:16,530 --> 00:21:18,720
of Dom this is graz or Dom which is a

418
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:23,910
chapel in Austria this is dumb the indie

419
00:21:23,910 --> 00:21:28,290
rock band and this is V DOM which is a

420
00:21:28,290 --> 00:21:30,270
mountain located in the Alps

421
00:21:30,270 --> 00:21:37,280
and again we see that word SAS

422
00:21:37,290 --> 00:21:41,170
so there are many kinds of Dom but the

423
00:21:41,170 --> 00:21:42,640
Dom that we're interested in is the

424
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:45,460
document object model wikipedia says

425
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:47,920
that the Dom is a cross-platform and

426
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:50,080
language independent convention for

427
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,460
representing and interacting with

428
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:55,150
objects in HTML XHTML and XML documents

429
00:21:55,150 --> 00:21:57,700
and I go it kind of makes sense to me

430
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:59,020
let's keep looking for another

431
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:01,810
definition so I search Mozilla

432
00:22:01,810 --> 00:22:03,400
developers Network and I see that the

433
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,770
Dom is a programming interface for HTML

434
00:22:05,770 --> 00:22:09,280
XML and SVG documents it provides a

435
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,290
structure representation of the document

436
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:14,020
a tree and it defines a way that the

437
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:15,850
structure can be accessed from programs

438
00:22:15,850 --> 00:22:17,830
so that they can change the document

439
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:21,880
structure style and content then I go ok

440
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:24,090
that makes a little bit more sense to me

441
00:22:24,090 --> 00:22:27,820
thanks mdn best of all they actually

442
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:29,830
have an illustration of the tree and I'm

443
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:31,300
like oh that's the Dom that's what it

444
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:36,520
looks like cool alright next is GUI and

445
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:41,500
CLI so I like to call CLI Klee because

446
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:43,270
if we call it GUI why can't we call it

447
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:48,040
clean so when I hear GUI this is what I

448
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:50,290
think of I think of gooey butter cake

449
00:22:50,290 --> 00:22:54,750
and then I just can't work anymore I

450
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:57,940
also think about gooey ducts I'm not

451
00:22:57,940 --> 00:22:59,290
sure if you all know what that is but

452
00:22:59,290 --> 00:23:02,200
it's basically a weird by valve that

453
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:05,170
lives in the ocean it's also edible kind

454
00:23:05,170 --> 00:23:08,200
of tasty little things but strangely

455
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,370
this is actually how you spell gooey

456
00:23:09,370 --> 00:23:14,620
duck kind of counterintuitive and then

457
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:17,770
when I read CLI I read it as klieg N and

458
00:23:17,770 --> 00:23:20,140
that makes me think about Paul Klee the

459
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:25,570
painter but most of us I think really

460
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:28,120
know that gooey our graphical user

461
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:29,920
interfaces and they were first

462
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:31,840
introduced in reaction to the perceived

463
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,120
steep learning curve of command-line

464
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:36,340
interfaces or Cleese as I like to call

465
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:38,590
them which require commands to be typed

466
00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:44,040
on the keyboard and lastly I have Ajax I

467
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:46,930
love the word Ajax but it's really

468
00:23:46,930 --> 00:23:48,000
outdated

469
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,650
because who even uses XML I also found

470
00:23:52,650 --> 00:23:54,570
it recently that jate but jQuery AJAX

471
00:23:54,570 --> 00:23:57,810
method has an option to set a sink to

472
00:23:57,810 --> 00:23:59,790
false so that means that you can

473
00:23:59,790 --> 00:24:09,600
actually be running s judge all right

474
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:13,320
in conclusion so oftentimes when we hear

475
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:15,510
these terms we're like I have no idea

476
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:17,580
what you're talking about and as soon as

477
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:19,500
you understand it you just get it and

478
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:21,660
because you just get it it makes it

479
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:23,820
really hard to explain those terms to

480
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:25,980
somebody else you kind of have to wait

481
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:27,240
for them and you kind of have to nudge

482
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:30,060
them until that light bulb just hits so

483
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:31,380
I know it's really difficult to explain

484
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:33,900
other people but I implore you when

485
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:36,840
somebody asks you to explain a term try

486
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:44,250
not to be like this or like this we're

487
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:46,050
trying to pass the buck to make somebody

488
00:24:46,050 --> 00:24:47,550
else explain it because you don't feel

489
00:24:47,550 --> 00:24:48,240
like it

490
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:51,750
and try to please be a little bit more

491
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:58,680
like this because it's really difficult

492
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:01,500
it's so hard to understand and let's

493
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:06,960
watch this video so we see here number

494
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:09,330
12 has just fallen on the ice and she's

495
00:25:09,330 --> 00:25:13,970
like I don't understand what GUI is

496
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:17,330
everyone around me is talking about GUI

497
00:25:17,330 --> 00:25:19,620
they're all talking about GUI and I

498
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:22,230
don't know what it means another number

499
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:25,530
12 is like let me help you I'm gonna

500
00:25:25,530 --> 00:25:30,480
explain GUI to you GUI it's just the

501
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:33,630
graphical user interface and other

502
00:25:33,630 --> 00:25:50,140
number 12 is like I understand thank you

503
00:25:50,150 --> 00:25:52,740
so when we're all a little bit more like

504
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:55,590
these number 12 then we can party

505
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:57,150
together in the computer science jargon
