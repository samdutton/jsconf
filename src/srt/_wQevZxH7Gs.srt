00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:07,200
hello everyone looking at you all here

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:11,010
today I'm reminded of how I felt

4
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:12,570
when I sat at the audience of an

5
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:14,370
accessibility talk myself a few years

6
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:18,000
back I remember feeling like this

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,770
accessibility thing that I didn't really

8
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:22,320
know too much about was probably this

9
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,150
really cool thing but I didn't really

10
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:25,740
know how it applied to me or to the

11
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:26,939
project that I was building at the time

12
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:29,760
I was building a mobile site and I kept

13
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,289
hearing about keyboard accessibility

14
00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:33,420
it's like how does this apply to the

15
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:35,430
thing that I'm building so I felt there

16
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:38,700
was this huge gap between my product and

17
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:41,190
accessibility and looking back now that

18
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:43,170
I kind of work on this I'm kind of

19
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:45,390
embarrassed about having been there but

20
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:47,190
it's at the same time I like to fully

21
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:49,260
own having felt that way because it's

22
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:51,449
it's helped me appreciate just how easy

23
00:00:51,449 --> 00:00:53,340
it is to feel that way there's no shame

24
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:56,160
in it and and yeah just the fact that

25
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,719
accessibility seems to be very far away

26
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:00,180
but it's not it's not really that far so

27
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:02,699
fast forward a few years I'm working at

28
00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:05,189
the Financial Times we since last year

29
00:01:05,189 --> 00:01:07,020
we were building the fastest greatest

30
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:10,220
new site in the industry we released it

31
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:12,720
about a year ago I was great

32
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,590
successfully braced replace an old

33
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:18,720
monolithic web site and we started

34
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,610
winning all these words and excelling in

35
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:22,799
performance and security basically every

36
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:24,930
metric that we had set our sights on we

37
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:27,630
were sending on so one day we decided to

38
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:29,100
look at accessibility maybe we were

39
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:31,229
excelling at this to kind of like by

40
00:01:31,229 --> 00:01:33,810
magic but unlike performance and

41
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:35,310
security we'd never really put a

42
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:37,590
collective effort into accessibility so

43
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:39,689
to no surprise we weren't very good and

44
00:01:39,689 --> 00:01:42,150
that since this talk is going to be all

45
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:43,950
about the lessons that we learned that

46
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:46,189
was really the first the very first one

47
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:48,659
feasibility doesn't just happen you have

48
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:50,909
to make it happen

49
00:01:50,909 --> 00:01:52,860
my name is Laura Carvajal I'm Smith

50
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:55,049
developer at the Financial Times this is

51
00:01:55,049 --> 00:01:56,399
an actual picture of our office in

52
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:58,680
London we are a magical place and we own

53
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:02,340
a rainbow you can see that for the for

54
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:05,640
the better part of 2017 I was the lead

55
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,619
of the accessibility team and today I

56
00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:09,869
want to tell you about so the lessons

57
00:02:09,869 --> 00:02:12,760
that we learned in the ft.com team once

58
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,500
realize we had built this beautiful

59
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,269
performance thing that really couldn't

60
00:02:16,269 --> 00:02:18,849
be enjoyed by everyone so if today

61
00:02:18,849 --> 00:02:20,200
you're in that place where you're

62
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,640
wondering if this whole thing applies to

63
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:24,159
your project hopefully today you'll walk

64
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:25,569
away convinced that it does and that

65
00:02:25,569 --> 00:02:29,319
it's that it's very easy to do so what

66
00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:31,239
is accessibility there are many

67
00:02:31,239 --> 00:02:34,060
definitions out there you'll find but I

68
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:35,680
like this one very much because it

69
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,140
really strips it down to to its core

70
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:39,909
I'm gonna read out to you web

71
00:02:39,909 --> 00:02:41,620
accessibility means that people with

72
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:43,920
disabilities can use the web that's it

73
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,540
it boils it down to making sure that

74
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:49,510
we're not denying access to anyone to

75
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:51,639
the thing that we're building but I want

76
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:53,230
to go a little bit deeper if you allow

77
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:55,290
me I want to tell you a quick story I

78
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:57,849
was in a shopping mall in London while

79
00:02:57,849 --> 00:03:01,120
back and we were I was with my daughter

80
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,680
we were going up those escalators and

81
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:05,319
and she asked me how does someone in a

82
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:07,329
wheelchair do what we're doing and she's

83
00:03:07,329 --> 00:03:08,889
she's only ten but she's very aware of

84
00:03:08,889 --> 00:03:10,930
accessibility mostly because I practiced

85
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:13,930
my accessibility talks on her and she's

86
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:15,129
asked me this and I'm all proud and I

87
00:03:15,129 --> 00:03:16,930
say oh there's a lift and as we were

88
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:18,790
going up there we she says well where is

89
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:20,290
it we really couldn't see it from there

90
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:22,629
once we got to the top with we saw that

91
00:03:22,629 --> 00:03:24,400
at the very at the other end of this

92
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,949
very long hallway you could see you

93
00:03:26,949 --> 00:03:29,139
could tell there was lift and she told

94
00:03:29,139 --> 00:03:31,150
me so in a wheelchair we have to go all

95
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:32,739
the way there and up and then all the

96
00:03:32,739 --> 00:03:34,510
way back to do what we just did in a few

97
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:37,389
seconds that's not fair and children

98
00:03:37,389 --> 00:03:39,400
have a way of seeing things for what

99
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,230
they are and even though this building

100
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:43,810
obviously it's very modern and comply

101
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:45,760
with all the standards it was it was

102
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,609
still a fact that it was not fair so I

103
00:03:48,609 --> 00:03:49,810
like to expand on the previous

104
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:52,180
definition by saying that beyond no

105
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:54,609
denying access we need to make sure that

106
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:56,919
access that we are providing is fair to

107
00:03:56,919 --> 00:03:58,750
all of our users and I'm giving full

108
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:02,199
credit to my daughter for that quote so

109
00:04:02,199 --> 00:04:04,510
we've covered what accessibility is but

110
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:06,310
we mentioned the word disability so

111
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:08,530
let's look at that a little bit more we

112
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:10,900
are a disability can be split roughly

113
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:13,419
into these four categories physical

114
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:17,620
visual hearing and cognitive and while

115
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:19,989
we may be more familiar with permanent

116
00:04:19,989 --> 00:04:22,900
disabilities we also have temporary and

117
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:24,419
situational

118
00:04:24,419 --> 00:04:27,300
so those close captions that benefit a

119
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:30,090
deaf person can also benefit anyone of

120
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:32,910
us on that spectrum and I like to say us

121
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:35,280
because each and every one of us spend

122
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,919
some time in our daily lives on that

123
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:39,900
spectrum so you may have other reasons

124
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:42,150
for wanting to to watch that breaking

125
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:45,240
news video without audio and so it's not

126
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,400
an us versus them thing and we all

127
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:51,000
benefit from accessibility but going

128
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,430
back to permanent disability there's

129
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:54,870
about 1 billion people in the world the

130
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:56,520
disabilities it's about 15% of the

131
00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:00,090
population but once you factor in where

132
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:02,550
in the world your user base is and what

133
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:04,650
their demographics are you'll get you'll

134
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:07,770
get a clearer picture a closer number to

135
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:09,990
what to what that percentage is for your

136
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:14,160
user base after we did those numbers it

137
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,800
worked out to be 26% around 26%

138
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,789
potentially of our of our user base and

139
00:05:19,789 --> 00:05:23,550
at Ft and you know many other places we

140
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:25,889
go to great lengths to support all

141
00:05:25,889 --> 00:05:28,410
segments of our audience so if we have

142
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:31,289
5% of people using IE 8 we kind of try

143
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:33,030
to make sure that they have some kind of

144
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:34,919
experience so in this case we had

145
00:05:34,919 --> 00:05:36,950
potentially 26% of people who weren't

146
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:39,000
getting an experience at all so that

147
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,979
kind of just seeing things in numbers

148
00:05:40,979 --> 00:05:43,950
tends to to motivate people to to get

149
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:45,690
started with things so let's say I've

150
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:47,849
convinced you now and you're determined

151
00:05:47,849 --> 00:05:49,200
to do this are you gonna fix

152
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,789
accessibility on your style it's gonna

153
00:05:50,789 --> 00:05:52,830
check you know what it's like and you're

154
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:55,470
gonna be their very best at it but it

155
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:57,360
scary and overwhelming and there's a lot

156
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,010
of information out there and it's kind

157
00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:00,330
of hard to know where to start

158
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:04,440
our suggestion is just start small for

159
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:08,250
us starting small meant doing this we

160
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:09,150
installed poly

161
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:13,490
that's pa-11 why a 11y for accessibility

162
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:17,220
and tight palace and open source tool

163
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:20,039
that can check your HTML and

164
00:06:20,039 --> 00:06:21,990
automatically detect some accessibility

165
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:23,970
errors and report them back to you it

166
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:25,289
doesn't detect everything but it's a

167
00:06:25,289 --> 00:06:26,430
really good place to start if you have

168
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:29,250
nothing so the way it works is it goes

169
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:31,320
through your your markup and it change

170
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:33,599
it checks it against the web contact

171
00:06:33,599 --> 00:06:36,120
content accessibility guidelines just or

172
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,150
wack

173
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:39,400
it's a list of criteria that accessible

174
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,830
websites should meet so it checks your

175
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:43,660
markup against that and it gives you a

176
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:45,760
report that looks something like that

177
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:49,479
that's when we ran pally manually

178
00:06:49,479 --> 00:06:52,570
against the telecom it shows two errors

179
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:54,729
so although the first time we did it had

180
00:06:54,729 --> 00:06:58,540
probably 100 errors and we once we did

181
00:06:58,540 --> 00:06:59,740
this for the first time we could have

182
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:02,410
gone about manually fixing all of the

183
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:04,030
error site it found and then running it

184
00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:07,330
again and so on but on such a large code

185
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:09,910
base like the one we have this wasn't

186
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:12,669
really efficient so we went for poly CI

187
00:07:12,669 --> 00:07:15,160
which is basically a wrapper around poly

188
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,690
that you can integrate into your

189
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:19,449
continuous integration process so it

190
00:07:19,449 --> 00:07:21,010
will run automatically every time I'll

191
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:22,900
show you in a little bit how that

192
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:25,660
happens there are other tools besides

193
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:28,870
poly that do this kind of thing but we

194
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:30,910
found poly just very easy to use very

195
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:33,340
easy to integrate and they are supported

196
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:34,510
by a fabulous team of hard-working

197
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:36,580
individuals that are just always there

198
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:39,370
with any you know any questions you may

199
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:40,900
have they're just very supportive and

200
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:43,300
just continuously working to improve the

201
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:45,370
tool so our so yeah we went with that

202
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:48,220
and it's been great so I want to show

203
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:50,440
you what that looks like in our project

204
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:53,280
this is a an overlay simplified view of

205
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:56,770
our of our stack we have several node

206
00:07:56,770 --> 00:07:59,260
apps that make up ft.com so you'll see

207
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:01,450
the front page have article app signup

208
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:04,169
page my 50 page those whole node apps

209
00:08:04,169 --> 00:08:07,960
they live in and github deploy them too

210
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:10,150
we will use circle CI for containers

211
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:13,060
integration and once we push that gets

212
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:14,650
triggered and if it's the master branch

213
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:15,900
it goes live to Heroku

214
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:18,340
again overly simplified but at least for

215
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:19,900
them for what we need it

216
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:23,349
it's enough of a view pally kicks in

217
00:08:23,349 --> 00:08:26,139
thus the continuous integration step so

218
00:08:26,139 --> 00:08:28,599
for every branch that we push this check

219
00:08:28,599 --> 00:08:31,479
happens on the code for that branch and

220
00:08:31,479 --> 00:08:34,630
then you get a report back to integrate

221
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:37,750
this with our with our existing build

222
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,789
process we only had to add one line and

223
00:08:39,789 --> 00:08:43,690
all that line did was called policy I in

224
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:47,709
our case since we have we generator and

225
00:08:47,709 --> 00:08:50,020
on the fly app for every branch we have

226
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:50,980
we just run poly

227
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:54,390
on that you know also generated up and

228
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:57,040
and yes so we ran it for every for every

229
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,250
branch we ran it on that on that app and

230
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:01,420
the interesting bit here is the

231
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:03,580
threshold argument that you see here so

232
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:06,670
that will allow pally to run and allow

233
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:09,910
to find up to 100 errors without

234
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:12,520
breaking your build which is ideally you

235
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:13,780
want the build to break if they're silly

236
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:17,530
even one error but since we had we

237
00:09:17,530 --> 00:09:19,150
couldn't really hold production and say

238
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:20,590
I'm gonna break all the bills for all

239
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:23,650
the apps and ft.com can't be updated

240
00:09:23,650 --> 00:09:25,240
until we fix all these because it was a

241
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,130
couple hundred errors so that wasn't

242
00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:29,680
viable that we no one would have let us

243
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,930
do that so we did was have the threshold

244
00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:34,570
argument and all of our bills were still

245
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:36,070
green so all of our branches were still

246
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:38,020
passing people were still walking

247
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:39,610
working this the same way they used to

248
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:42,010
work but we were getting reports now

249
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:43,570
like the ones you see here

250
00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:46,630
of what was broken in that branch so we

251
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:50,020
spent a few weeks we'll put this inside

252
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:52,690
of all of our all of our apps and maybe

253
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:54,940
a day because that's it's literally one

254
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:56,650
night I need to add and then we spent

255
00:09:56,650 --> 00:09:58,420
the next few weeks going through all of

256
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:00,940
the apps fixing the accessibility issues

257
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:03,700
that that were found and then for every

258
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:06,430
app where we reach zero errors we remove

259
00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:09,580
the threshold and now for any new branch

260
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:13,000
that was created off of that codebase if

261
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,740
it had accessibility errors then it

262
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:16,270
would break bill so once you remove the

263
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:18,580
threshold there's no errors allowed so

264
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:21,460
that once we did this for all of our

265
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:24,700
apps we got to a place where we were

266
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:27,430
confident that we were stopping any new

267
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:29,470
accessibility errors from making it into

268
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:31,390
production and I was a big deal for us

269
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:32,860
we felt like you know with which we

270
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:35,350
reached a really good place so no more

271
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:37,060
errors no more new accessibility errors

272
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:38,560
would make it into into the labs live

273
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:41,890
site but we realized that even though

274
00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:43,930
people were all for ballet they were all

275
00:10:43,930 --> 00:10:47,050
supportive of accessibility they knew

276
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:48,610
what it was and everyone was really

277
00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:50,470
excited even about having their builds

278
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:52,020
broken people were looking forward to

279
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:54,100
their bill being broken so that they

280
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:56,800
could see what the issue was we didn't

281
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,780
really do a great job of explaining how

282
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:00,970
those bills would break and more

283
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:03,220
importantly why you had to do once I

284
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:04,990
your build was broken so that was lesson

285
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:07,689
number two that we learned before you

286
00:11:07,689 --> 00:11:11,529
set the build on fire trained people so

287
00:11:11,529 --> 00:11:15,069
how do you go about that so we you could

288
00:11:15,069 --> 00:11:17,350
go about it two ways you can show them

289
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:19,180
what what they can expect

290
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:20,649
pollito fine and then what to do about

291
00:11:20,649 --> 00:11:23,230
it and then you can of course do some

292
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:24,970
training courses we'll talk about both

293
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:28,600
in a little bit so in terms of what Poli

294
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,060
can find in your project I'm gonna skip

295
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:32,379
through these fairly quickly because we

296
00:11:32,379 --> 00:11:34,089
don't have too much time but I'm happy

297
00:11:34,089 --> 00:11:36,160
to chat about any of these in the break

298
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:41,920
or at any other time so one of the most

299
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,649
common issues that Holly found was color

300
00:11:43,649 --> 00:11:46,540
contrast issues when the text doesn't

301
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:47,829
have enough contrast with the background

302
00:11:47,829 --> 00:11:49,620
that's a big deal we had it everywhere

303
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:54,519
and another thing was alt text missing

304
00:11:54,519 --> 00:11:59,889
in images alt text is what the like the

305
00:11:59,889 --> 00:12:01,600
name says the alternative if a user

306
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,670
can't see the image of blind users using

307
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:05,920
a screen reader the old text is the only

308
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,870
thing that will tell them what the image

309
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:09,970
is and it was missing from from a lot of

310
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:11,709
our images that was a that was very

311
00:12:11,709 --> 00:12:17,170
common labels and input fields sometimes

312
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:19,920
they weren't related we would forget to

313
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:23,319
relate him by the ID and your UI will

314
00:12:23,319 --> 00:12:25,240
look the same but it will break things

315
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:27,579
completely for some assistive tech so

316
00:12:27,579 --> 00:12:30,040
that was very common as well required

317
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:32,170
fields that we would mark with an

318
00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:34,149
asterisk and then check with JavaScript

319
00:12:34,149 --> 00:12:36,250
but we never heard had the word required

320
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:38,949
in some of the in some of the markup and

321
00:12:38,949 --> 00:12:41,019
that's a big deal too so if you feel

322
00:12:41,019 --> 00:12:43,110
required make sure your labor required

323
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:47,649
ads were also a big problem I can go on

324
00:12:47,649 --> 00:12:49,480
for for a while about this but I won't

325
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,740
in this talk but if you have any

326
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:52,149
questions if you have ads on your site

327
00:12:52,149 --> 00:12:55,300
and you're worried about what they do to

328
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:56,829
accessibility we can we can have a chat

329
00:12:56,829 --> 00:12:59,800
after but in short they're they're a big

330
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:02,529
mess also do having duplicate content on

331
00:13:02,529 --> 00:13:04,959
the site can be an issue and there ways

332
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:07,389
to mitigate that and one of the ways is

333
00:13:07,389 --> 00:13:09,550
adding some invisible content when you

334
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:11,410
actually have to have duplicate content

335
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:13,029
like those are too mighty buttons that

336
00:13:13,029 --> 00:13:14,470
just have to be there

337
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:17,110
if you add some context that's invisible

338
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:19,420
that will help people using assistive

339
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:21,490
tech anyway I'm happy to chat about any

340
00:13:21,490 --> 00:13:24,310
any of these afterwards another thing

341
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:26,590
that you can do in terms of training

342
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:29,080
your teams it's doing some accessibility

343
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,940
courses there's a lot of them out there

344
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:33,010
for free this is a very good one that we

345
00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:35,020
did it's where we got our start it's a

346
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:37,930
free Udacity course by Alice Boxhall and

347
00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:39,580
Rob Dodson from Google from the

348
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:41,200
accessibility team I'll share the slides

349
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,790
later so you can grab the URL but it's

350
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:43,540
really really good

351
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:46,000
you can do it at your own pace and it

352
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,160
will give you a good introduction and

353
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,410
like solid understanding of the basics

354
00:13:50,410 --> 00:13:51,700
of accessibility so I really recommend

355
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:57,520
it so we've set the tools tools like

356
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:01,290
Pali can cover about 20 to 30 percent of

357
00:14:01,290 --> 00:14:03,970
accessibility errors on your site so

358
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:05,980
this is sort of the first stage of your

359
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:08,590
journey so you're kind of there and it's

360
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:10,420
a big deal you've covered a lot and your

361
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:12,070
site is very likely a lot more

362
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:14,260
accessible than it was before but

363
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:16,510
there's a bit more to go before you get

364
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:18,790
to the summit and which means you need

365
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:20,290
to make your site fully accessible and

366
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:22,750
to do that there's some manual

367
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:24,610
intervention that that needs to happen

368
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:27,730
so I'm gonna go over that now so this

369
00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:31,360
the the manual side of things can be in

370
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,430
the form of an external audit you can

371
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:35,800
have a third party check your site like

372
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,210
accessibility experts checking you or

373
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:39,850
your side and your markup you can do

374
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:41,710
some customer research ideally putting

375
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:44,140
your site in front of users with

376
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:45,340
disabilities that can give you feedback

377
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:47,440
and then you can learn to use this

378
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,210
assistive technology yourself so you can

379
00:14:49,210 --> 00:14:51,100
sort of getting the shoes of some of

380
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:52,420
these users these are not mutually

381
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:54,400
exclusive ideally should be doing them

382
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:58,990
all so in our case the external audit

383
00:14:58,990 --> 00:15:01,150
was performed by the digital

384
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:02,770
accessibility Center I'm going to show

385
00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:04,450
you a quick video of the work that they

386
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:12,640
did it's see if we have audio my name is

387
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:15,490
Rebecca Morgan I have cyber policy I

388
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:18,580
test with all situation and cabrona

389
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:26,960
method choose three click button

390
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:29,060
the controls with the videos are not

391
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:30,970
even that big jargon

392
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:33,500
my name is James okay and I'm the color

393
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,180
contrast and readability analyst at the

394
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:36,890
digital accessibility Center and today

395
00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:39,230
on the homepage I encountered some text

396
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:42,440
displayed on top of images text

397
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:44,060
displayed on top of images can be quite

398
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:46,279
difficult to read because of the varying

399
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:47,870
color contrast of the image behind the

400
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:49,700
text and we see add I'm a website

401
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:51,620
analyst at the DAC

402
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:54,230
I test using zoomtext with audible

403
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:56,990
feedback as the assistive technology i'm

404
00:15:56,990 --> 00:15:58,520
gonna scroll on down hello

405
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:10,070
and just demonstrate so there's an empty

406
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:12,680
space here which would be an ideal place

407
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:18,440
ft to put the subheading name is

408
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:21,290
jonathan brew I'm a cognitive analyst at

409
00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:23,209
the digital accessibility Center there

410
00:16:23,209 --> 00:16:25,940
is a moving image that distracts me from

411
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:29,120
all the content another issue I've found

412
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,850
on the homepage is the carousel when

413
00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:34,400
navigating through it I couldn't find

414
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:38,380
the arrow to to navigate to each page

415
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:41,690
and once I found that eventually finding

416
00:16:41,690 --> 00:16:49,810
the other previous button was difficult

417
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:52,760
hello there my name is Mike Jones I'm

418
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:55,310
completely blind and I'm a screen reader

419
00:16:55,310 --> 00:16:56,960
analyst for the digital accessibility

420
00:16:56,960 --> 00:17:01,480
Center on one of the articles I tested

421
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:04,360
there are several headings that

422
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:08,500
announces read more and these also

423
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:11,540
interrupt the articling it's not clear

424
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:13,870
what the user will be reading more about

425
00:17:13,870 --> 00:17:16,579
verb etre this these headings actually

426
00:17:16,579 --> 00:17:18,290
interrupt the main article that the user

427
00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:20,449
is reading so it would have been helpful

428
00:17:20,449 --> 00:17:23,720
to me to ensure that the article read

429
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:25,820
smoothly and continuously without

430
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:31,190
interruptions so this is only a two

431
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:33,890
minute video but we we actually were

432
00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:35,120
lucky enough to be able to spend the day

433
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:38,480
a full day with a with the analysts and

434
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,430
it was I highly recommend it if you have

435
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:41,870
the chance because it will really change

436
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:44,300
your perspective forever of how people

437
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:48,500
use the product that you're building so

438
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:51,890
that audit that was performed on our

439
00:17:51,890 --> 00:17:54,260
site produced a 200 page report with all

440
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:57,080
the errors that they found and we

441
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:58,430
wouldn't spend maybe a couple months

442
00:17:58,430 --> 00:18:02,200
fixing those it was a lot of errors and

443
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,890
in the end we got an official

444
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:06,230
accreditation that said st tacoma is

445
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:08,630
accessible to such-and-such level and we

446
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:10,130
were very very glad to get it obviously

447
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:13,280
i was months of hard work but it's it's

448
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,930
a title we don't really want to hold

449
00:18:14,930 --> 00:18:17,780
alone so if there anyone is anyone here

450
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:19,400
from you know other news publications or

451
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,740
really anyone this is really one metric

452
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:23,030
we should all be trying to outdo each

453
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:25,430
other on kind the same way we tried to

454
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:27,140
outdo each other on performance we want

455
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:28,700
to be faster than the competition but we

456
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:29,840
want to be more accessible than the

457
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,190
competition we should be we should be

458
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:34,790
and compete on this we all win if we're

459
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:38,150
all more accessible so the second thing

460
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:41,690
is to do customer research get your

461
00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:44,090
product in front of actual users because

462
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:45,500
you may have all the theory right you

463
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,570
may have your accreditation in place but

464
00:18:47,570 --> 00:18:49,700
you want your new features to be to be

465
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:52,340
tested by actual users or you might end

466
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:53,750
up building something that looks good on

467
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:56,180
paper but still get it very very wrong

468
00:18:56,180 --> 00:19:00,080
and lastly you can learn to use assist

469
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,720
assistive tech yourself this this you

470
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:03,700
can do for free

471
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:05,260
and I highly encourage it because it's

472
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:07,510
also a lot of fun these are some of the

473
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:10,630
tools that we use on our setup we use

474
00:19:10,630 --> 00:19:12,700
Mac's at the FT so we use voiceover

475
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:18,130
voiceover keyboard only and we zoom if

476
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:19,600
you're on a Mac you can get these for

477
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:23,110
free one thing that really helped was

478
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:25,600
going keyboard only so initially what we

479
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,070
did was when we were about to test the

480
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:28,840
side we would just not use the trackpad

481
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:30,639
and not use the mouse and test it with a

482
00:19:30,639 --> 00:19:34,649
keyboard but it really helps to find the

483
00:19:34,649 --> 00:19:37,809
more nuanced issues if you go keyboard

484
00:19:37,809 --> 00:19:40,960
only all the time so we did that just to

485
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,000
experiment but then we can stay doing

486
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,309
that you know those who have volunteered

487
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:46,299
to do this

488
00:19:46,299 --> 00:19:49,570
this was my set up back in November last

489
00:19:49,570 --> 00:19:51,850
year when I started doing this so it I

490
00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:55,539
do recommend printing out the shortcuts

491
00:19:55,539 --> 00:19:56,980
for the apps that you most used before

492
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:59,559
you kind of unplug your mouse and and

493
00:19:59,559 --> 00:20:01,120
turn off your trackpad can be really

494
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:03,250
helpful so this was mean I said it back

495
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:06,700
then but as you use this you memorize

496
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:08,200
the shortcuts even if you don't want to

497
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,570
so I think I'm about almost of that

498
00:20:10,570 --> 00:20:12,639
papers gone I think about how about 10

499
00:20:12,639 --> 00:20:14,529
left that I haven't managed to learn

500
00:20:14,529 --> 00:20:16,559
because I don't use them very often but

501
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:18,760
but yeah it's really really helpful to

502
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:21,070
just really really not use the mouse and

503
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:23,950
the trackpad I just did that by having

504
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:25,779
an external keyboard with like a numeric

505
00:20:25,779 --> 00:20:28,360
keypad but one if I'm stalking my laptop

506
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,590
and I don't have the external keyboard

507
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:32,440
and my track that's gonna be active I

508
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:34,059
try to make it as uncomfortable as

509
00:20:34,059 --> 00:20:36,070
possible to use so I remove all the

510
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:38,769
goodies that that app will give us make

511
00:20:38,769 --> 00:20:42,250
it very slow so that if I you know start

512
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:43,690
going back to using the trackpad a lot

513
00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:45,669
I'll notice it's uncomfortable and

514
00:20:45,669 --> 00:20:48,519
remember to go back to the keyboard so

515
00:20:48,519 --> 00:20:50,260
if I if you have the chance to do it I

516
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:52,179
highly recommend it I'd also make you

517
00:20:52,179 --> 00:20:54,610
faster you become this power user and

518
00:20:54,610 --> 00:20:56,529
you learn to you learn very quickly

519
00:20:56,529 --> 00:20:59,200
which sites are accessible and which

520
00:20:59,200 --> 00:20:59,980
signs aren't

521
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:01,809
you'll find in github you can navigate

522
00:21:01,809 --> 00:21:03,760
around without a mouse very quickly I

523
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:06,039
feed on already and you'll find you can

524
00:21:06,039 --> 00:21:07,809
do this in other sites that maybe you

525
00:21:07,809 --> 00:21:08,470
didn't do before

526
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:10,659
so that's lesson number three that we

527
00:21:10,659 --> 00:21:14,970
learn throw away your mouse

528
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:16,999
okay so going back to this list of

529
00:21:16,999 --> 00:21:19,879
things that you still have to fix it's

530
00:21:19,879 --> 00:21:22,460
it's you've learned to use all the tools

531
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:24,440
your setup with your keyboard it's very

532
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:26,029
tempting to just roll up your sleeves

533
00:21:26,029 --> 00:21:28,820
and try to fix everything yourself but

534
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:30,759
if we can give you one piece of advice

535
00:21:30,759 --> 00:21:33,769
don't don't do this one thing that I

536
00:21:33,769 --> 00:21:34,909
learned I want to say I learned pretty

537
00:21:34,909 --> 00:21:37,009
quickly but it took me a while to learn

538
00:21:37,009 --> 00:21:39,320
it was that trying to fix all these

539
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:41,029
things especially on a large site like a

540
00:21:41,029 --> 00:21:42,710
cheetah come it's not really the right

541
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:45,139
answer you will most definitely burn out

542
00:21:45,139 --> 00:21:49,039
very quickly it's inefficient bugs

543
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:50,299
New York's ability bugs will happen

544
00:21:50,299 --> 00:21:51,919
faster then you can clean them up and

545
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:53,779
you really are doing a disservice to

546
00:21:53,779 --> 00:21:56,059
your team by becoming the bottleneck the

547
00:21:56,059 --> 00:21:57,320
person that fixes everything

548
00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:00,619
so most people really want to help and

549
00:22:00,619 --> 00:22:02,720
want to you know get this right if they

550
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:05,869
just know how to do that so spend some

551
00:22:05,869 --> 00:22:08,029
of your effort not just in fixing the

552
00:22:08,029 --> 00:22:10,389
bugs but in in raising awareness

553
00:22:10,389 --> 00:22:12,950
awareness and training your people on

554
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:16,460
accessibility yeah instead of just

555
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:18,049
trying to fix everything yourself and

556
00:22:18,049 --> 00:22:20,960
also if you have a say in your

557
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:23,389
recruitment process make it a part of it

558
00:22:23,389 --> 00:22:25,940
so this is this was our old requirements

559
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:28,220
based job description last year but we

560
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:31,419
added it in there and now it's sort of

561
00:22:31,419 --> 00:22:33,499
you can add it in there at the bottom

562
00:22:33,499 --> 00:22:35,720
just sneak it into the desired skills

563
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:39,350
and it can work its way up and also if

564
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:40,850
you have an online test or some kind of

565
00:22:40,850 --> 00:22:42,649
coding test at some point make sure you

566
00:22:42,649 --> 00:22:44,119
include an accessibility question in

567
00:22:44,119 --> 00:22:46,490
there and I apologize for redacting some

568
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:47,690
of these because we're actively hiring

569
00:22:47,690 --> 00:22:49,279
and I don't want to give too much away

570
00:22:49,279 --> 00:22:51,019
but the idea is that you know you have a

571
00:22:51,019 --> 00:22:54,049
some markup and you asked how would you

572
00:22:54,049 --> 00:22:55,100
make this more accessible so you can

573
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:57,980
engage you know if people have had

574
00:22:57,980 --> 00:22:59,749
exposure to accessibility or at least if

575
00:22:59,749 --> 00:23:02,029
there's interest because if you spend

576
00:23:02,029 --> 00:23:04,009
time training your team ideally you want

577
00:23:04,009 --> 00:23:05,240
to if you want to bring more people in

578
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:07,850
into your team ideally they will have

579
00:23:07,850 --> 00:23:09,110
some knowledge of accessibility or if

580
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:11,389
not at least think that it's something

581
00:23:11,389 --> 00:23:13,519
that's important to to build into a

582
00:23:13,519 --> 00:23:15,590
project anyway so if you have a saying

583
00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:18,289
in your in your hiring process just

584
00:23:18,289 --> 00:23:21,230
sneak it in there so yeah lesson number

585
00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:22,940
four that we learned kind of the hard

586
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:25,759
way don't take this all on yourself the

587
00:23:25,759 --> 00:23:26,930
bulk of the work really

588
00:23:26,930 --> 00:23:29,000
taken care of if everyone's a part of it

589
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,700
so and even beyond developers designers

590
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:34,220
developers QA product we all have a role

591
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:38,020
to play in making our product accessible

592
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:40,190
another good way to spread the word is

593
00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:41,660
making an event out of it if you have a

594
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:43,610
chance

595
00:23:43,610 --> 00:23:46,160
back in November last year we put

596
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:48,650
together a roadshow in like an open

597
00:23:48,650 --> 00:23:50,240
space that we have at the office we

598
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:53,750
invited everyone to fill out a look at

599
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:56,000
perform using a screen reader it's kind

600
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,440
of the software that if you're blind

601
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,580
you're likely to use to navigate

602
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:00,800
websites it will read out the screen to

603
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:03,890
you and we offered a free 20 pound

604
00:24:03,890 --> 00:24:05,750
Amazon gift card and turns out people

605
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:07,580
like free stuff so they showed up so we

606
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:10,580
had a big crowd and this is the form

607
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:12,650
that they had to complete and as you can

608
00:24:12,650 --> 00:24:15,560
see or cannot see you can't see very

609
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:18,140
much you were forced to rely on the

610
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:19,970
screen reader to tell you what's on the

611
00:24:19,970 --> 00:24:22,700
screen so and a lot of people who

612
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:24,710
stopped by had never used a screen

613
00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:25,850
reader before didn't know what it was

614
00:24:25,850 --> 00:24:27,920
and some of them didn't even know about

615
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:30,530
the concept of accessibility so this was

616
00:24:30,530 --> 00:24:32,720
a good way to getting a lot of people

617
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:36,610
exposed to to all this this is a forum

618
00:24:36,610 --> 00:24:39,260
it's a very simple form that was built

619
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:40,940
to be accessible so you could fill it

620
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:44,360
out using a screen reader and it was we

621
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:46,910
did this for a couple hours in this open

622
00:24:46,910 --> 00:24:50,210
area and the big takeaway from this this

623
00:24:50,210 --> 00:24:51,950
experiment it's one of the highlights of

624
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:54,260
my career in the 15 years so that I've

625
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:56,720
been doing software engineering it's

626
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:59,390
moments like this one that's if you know

627
00:24:59,390 --> 00:25:00,650
him that's Patrick Hammond he's a

628
00:25:00,650 --> 00:25:02,840
seasoned developer who's really you know

629
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:05,240
surprised by by web stuff but this was

630
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:08,630
his reaction to using a screen reader to

631
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:12,850
use the thing that he built for a living

632
00:25:12,850 --> 00:25:15,500
so and we got that kind of reaction from

633
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:18,020
a lot of people so it's we managed to

634
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:20,840
create this space of collective empathy

635
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:22,280
where we had a couple dozen people's

636
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:24,620
sort of step into someone else's shoes

637
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:26,330
for a little bit and they were all

638
00:25:26,330 --> 00:25:28,960
walked away with the knowledge that

639
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,700
they're the product that they build it's

640
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:33,110
not only used in the way that they use

641
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:34,730
it a lot of people use it in many

642
00:25:34,730 --> 00:25:36,920
different ways so it's it was very

643
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:38,400
powerful in sending message

644
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:41,330
and very effective and raising awareness

645
00:25:41,330 --> 00:25:44,040
so I was lesson number five talked about

646
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:45,150
it a lot

647
00:25:45,150 --> 00:25:47,820
spread the word make it your thing you

648
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:49,770
never know who's listening and you're

649
00:25:49,770 --> 00:25:51,420
probably reaching more people than you

650
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:53,220
think by just talking about it in the

651
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:56,990
office or at meetups or events like this

652
00:25:56,990 --> 00:26:00,270
so we've said that you know these are

653
00:26:00,270 --> 00:26:02,340
some ways to help make your site more

654
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:05,010
accessible but obviously these two at

655
00:26:05,010 --> 00:26:06,960
the top cost money so it doesn't mean

656
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,430
that you can't make your product

657
00:26:08,430 --> 00:26:10,110
accessible if you don't have the budget

658
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:13,440
for it but if you can it's it helps you

659
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,420
reach that that some it helps you reach

660
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:17,670
higher so there may be times when you

661
00:26:17,670 --> 00:26:19,920
need to raise cash internally or

662
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,929
externally to fund your accessibility

663
00:26:21,929 --> 00:26:23,790
efforts if you need to dedicate one or

664
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:24,960
two people or some of your time to

665
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,640
accessibility you may need to raise some

666
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:29,429
money and we needed to do this at the FT

667
00:26:29,429 --> 00:26:32,160
to fund to fund our team and me being

668
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:34,470
new to this and kind of naive say okay

669
00:26:34,470 --> 00:26:36,030
well accessibility is can it's the right

670
00:26:36,030 --> 00:26:38,520
thing to do it's you know give me give

671
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:41,760
me some cash and we learned this one we

672
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,290
learned very quickly it's the right

673
00:26:43,290 --> 00:26:44,640
thing to do doesn't really get you a

674
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,980
budget so you need to kind of make a

675
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:50,670
case for it and Alex Bartlett who works

676
00:26:50,670 --> 00:26:52,710
with us at the origami team put this

677
00:26:52,710 --> 00:26:54,780
together a while ago she's done a lot of

678
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:56,940
research on sort of the business case

679
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:58,350
for accessibility how do you sell it to

680
00:26:58,350 --> 00:27:01,710
the business and she found that avoiding

681
00:27:01,710 --> 00:27:04,440
litigation avoiding being sued is one of

682
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:06,300
the most evidence business cases for

683
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:08,429
accessibility so if you're a big enough

684
00:27:08,429 --> 00:27:11,040
company you risk getting sued and the

685
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:13,290
cost when getting sued if your site is

686
00:27:13,290 --> 00:27:16,320
not accessible and the cost of that

687
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,300
lawsuit and the sort of the the brand

688
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:21,510
damage is a lot higher than what you

689
00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:23,640
could invest in a small team to you know

690
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:26,400
fix stuff and get things up to speed so

691
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:28,110
there's a link to I'll share these

692
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:29,309
slides later so you can grab that link

693
00:27:29,309 --> 00:27:31,770
it's a very good presentation and yeah

694
00:27:31,770 --> 00:27:33,480
you have a lot of information if you

695
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:35,790
need to make this case yourself in your

696
00:27:35,790 --> 00:27:39,960
company so before we finish I want to

697
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,790
take you back to how this all started

698
00:27:41,790 --> 00:27:45,780
for us at the FT I was in bug Duty one

699
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:47,700
day and I saw this card in JIRA that

700
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:50,160
said integrate poly I didn't know what

701
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,930
poly was had no idea it was my

702
00:27:51,930 --> 00:27:54,360
turn about dude I just grabbed it and I

703
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:55,950
got a little bit curious and I looked

704
00:27:55,950 --> 00:27:58,530
through the history of the cart and I

705
00:27:58,530 --> 00:27:59,910
saw that he had been bouncing around our

706
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:03,320
board for months and it was only until

707
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:07,020
my colleague Ben Fletcher who was a

708
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:08,520
senior developer at the time and who

709
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:11,040
happens to be deaf blind he prioritized

710
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:12,780
it and he just made us all whether this

711
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:14,130
is something that maybe we should be

712
00:28:14,130 --> 00:28:17,280
working on and this is the last lesson

713
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:19,770
that I want to leave you with diversity

714
00:28:19,770 --> 00:28:21,570
will improve your product will improve

715
00:28:21,570 --> 00:28:23,750
your team and will improve your life

716
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:27,090
this Ben's small action on that JIRA

717
00:28:27,090 --> 00:28:29,700
boards snowballed into us building a

718
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:32,550
better product the team learning about

719
00:28:32,550 --> 00:28:34,980
accessibility and that to me standing in

720
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:36,980
front of you're here today

721
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:40,680
so to recap and to give you things that

722
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:42,480
you could do tonight in under half an

723
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:45,180
hour accessibility doesn't just happen

724
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:46,980
you have to do something about it one

725
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:48,990
good way to start is integrate piling

726
00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:50,580
into your process give it a high

727
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:52,830
threshold just let it run and start

728
00:28:52,830 --> 00:28:54,900
getting reports of what's broken with

729
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:58,080
what you're building if anything train

730
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:59,730
your people so you can something you can

731
00:28:59,730 --> 00:29:01,830
do very quickly share that link to that

732
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:03,420
Udacity course and may people do it on

733
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:05,100
their own time so there's some awareness

734
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:06,900
of what accessibility is and why it

735
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:09,570
matters throw away your mouse you can do

736
00:29:09,570 --> 00:29:11,340
that very quickly but ideally print out

737
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:14,280
shortcuts beforehand don't take it all

738
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:15,060
on yourself

739
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:17,130
share share the load the more people

740
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:19,410
around you who know about it the easier

741
00:29:19,410 --> 00:29:20,640
it will be and the more efficient you'll

742
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,770
be talk about it

743
00:29:22,770 --> 00:29:26,730
Twitter put up together Roadshow if you

744
00:29:26,730 --> 00:29:30,000
can in terms of budget if you have to

745
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,850
raise one I remember the the biggest

746
00:29:32,850 --> 00:29:35,130
motivator is avoiding getting sued and

747
00:29:35,130 --> 00:29:36,180
getting sued is expensive and

748
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:38,340
embarrassing and we don't want that it's

749
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:39,570
probably cheaper to just invest in

750
00:29:39,570 --> 00:29:42,360
accessibility and diversity matters and

751
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:44,490
I wish I had something I could give you

752
00:29:44,490 --> 00:29:46,170
that you could do in a couple minutes

753
00:29:46,170 --> 00:29:48,120
tonight but for this one I don't but if

754
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:51,990
you have a say in hiring or in any of

755
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:54,450
these areas and where you work try and

756
00:29:54,450 --> 00:29:57,810
prioritize in the the most more diverse

757
00:29:57,810 --> 00:29:59,190
that you have in your team the better

758
00:29:59,190 --> 00:30:00,570
the thing that you build on the burial

759
00:30:00,570 --> 00:30:04,770
life will be lastly a while back having

760
00:30:04,770 --> 00:30:05,530
this PD

761
00:30:05,530 --> 00:30:07,680
only entrance to a public building

762
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:09,760
wasn't a norm there was nothing wrong

763
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:10,060
with it

764
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:11,620
but now would be unthinkable right to

765
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:13,360
have you know only stairs be the only

766
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:14,880
way you can get into a public building

767
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:17,860
so we're a little bit behind on software

768
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:19,600
so don't wait until it becomes

769
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:23,170
unthinkable for to build inaccessible

770
00:30:23,170 --> 00:30:25,510
websites the the time to make to start

771
00:30:25,510 --> 00:30:27,190
making your website accessible is really

772
00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:31,260
now so just do it thank you very much
