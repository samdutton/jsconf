00:00:08,179 --> 00:00:11,040

we are an interesting lot when you look

2
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:12,960
at the community as a whole we are a

3
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,830
ragtag group of developers designers

4
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:19,410
noobs and elites we have a sordid

5
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:21,119
history as one of the greatest

6
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:23,310
technological battles was played out

7
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:27,240
across our community and left us in a

8
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:29,400
wasteland of stagnation for years are

9
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:32,790
you six big vendors have looted and

10
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:34,739
plundered our community and we survived

11
00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:36,840
it and some would say we came out even

12
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:40,079
better for it many of our original

13
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:42,989
heroes have been lost to legend or have

14
00:00:42,989 --> 00:00:44,640
been scorned by the Dragons they sought

15
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,969
to slay we have seen new leaders rise

16
00:00:47,969 --> 00:00:50,969
with vigor and innovation not seen in

17
00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:54,570
other programming languages we are a

18
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:58,140
community of rejuvenation of rebuilding

19
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:01,590
of finding problems addressing them and

20
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:05,460
fixing them properly we are a community

21
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:09,930
of developers who prefer j/s but use a

22
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:12,390
variety of other languages technologies

23
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:16,680
and tools to accomplish our task we are

24
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:19,229
at a point of a huge renaissance of

25
00:01:19,229 --> 00:01:23,189
interest excitement and energy and yet I

26
00:01:23,189 --> 00:01:27,990
worry I feel as the drums of war from

27
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:30,180
the browser vendors continue to be

28
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:33,450
louder and louder and the rising tide of

29
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:35,509
interest sweeps back into our community

30
00:01:35,509 --> 00:01:41,100
are we ready for it what will our

31
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,649
community be will we have built

32
00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:47,250
something sustainable or made yet

33
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:50,479
another flash in the pan technology cult

34
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:54,509
the new generation of JavaScript you me

35
00:01:54,509 --> 00:02:00,270
those of you at home just watching this

36
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:03,820
that was supposed to be really exciting

37
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:06,530
where we have learned from our past or

38
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:08,540
are we doomed to repeat the exact same

39
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:12,470
mistakes in the worst possible ways let

40
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:15,260
us not just begin a discussion today let

41
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:17,960
us trigger action implement change and

42
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:21,130
inspire our fellow developers

43
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:23,660
sustainability should be the most

44
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:25,610
important goal for the technology

45
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:27,980
community at large and yet it's never

46
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:30,040
discussed at a technology conference

47
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:34,630
tonight we will do more than discuss

48
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:39,590
chapter one education j/s is not a toy

49
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:41,900
language you all believe that otherwise

50
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:44,990
you wouldn't be here the reality that

51
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:47,950
reality is just now permeating the

52
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:51,800
general populace and their first

53
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:55,120
impressions of jas is absolutely abysmal

54
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,650
how many of you know what shows up when

55
00:02:57,650 --> 00:02:59,920
you search for JavaScript and Google

56
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:04,840
here I'll show you look at the links

57
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:08,090
Wikipedia w3 schools which hasn't been

58
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:15,060
updated in a long time and download Java

59
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:17,000
maybe you're saying to yourself that

60
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,040
JavaScript just that term is too broad

61
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,850
nobody in their right mind when they're

62
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:24,380
learning a language would just type the

63
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:26,840
language name so let's you know what go

64
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,220
for something that they would type and

65
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:29,750
most of us probably have type quite

66
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:34,760
frequently JavaScript array yeah not

67
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:39,230
much better the first quality link on

68
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:42,910
this page is the MDC Doc's link eight

69
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:46,430
non-existent if you want me to take it a

70
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:48,470
step further that's actual let's

71
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:50,930
actually do a query that a first-time

72
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:55,400
developer would do learn JavaScript the

73
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:58,190
first link that actually presents proper

74
00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:00,890
JavaScript learning is John Resig at

75
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:04,430
again position eight and the stuff

76
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:08,140
that's in there would blow their minds

77
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:11,989
so this is the first impression of

78
00:04:11,989 --> 00:04:13,170
JavaScript

79
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:15,180
by the general masses who are coming to

80
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:18,570
this language and once you see this you

81
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:21,060
can see why people consider it a toy

82
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:23,460
language and you can understand why

83
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:26,730
there is so much horrible JavaScript

84
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:30,330
code out there and so much disdain for

85
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:31,860
this language that we've all come here

86
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:35,100
to talk about we have hidden our better

87
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:37,590
tutorials our learnings and our dock one

88
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:39,660
lay a one browser or maybe doesn't

89
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:41,040
really even execute all and they don't

90
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,190
know how to validate that but it becomes

91
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:46,880
a close approximation of runnable code

92
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,110
then they publish it back out to the

93
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:51,680
world proud of what they've done and

94
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,479
continue to perpetuate this plague of

95
00:04:54,479 --> 00:05:01,169
horrible code we have failed our fellow

96
00:05:01,169 --> 00:05:07,200
developers case you didn't notice that

97
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:10,860
was link 3 on array we have failed our

98
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:13,110
fellow developers and designers in the

99
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:14,970
sense we have made it almost impossible

100
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:18,780
to learn proper JavaScript a language

101
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:21,710
with both beauty and warts admittedly

102
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:24,810
some will say it is not our fault the

103
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:27,330
browser vendors they they should have

104
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:29,970
provided better API documentation for

105
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:31,919
their implementations or the standards

106
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:33,539
committee that's what they're there for

107
00:05:33,539 --> 00:05:37,229
right I am calling on that

108
00:05:37,229 --> 00:05:41,600
tonight I say it is up to us to invite

109
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:45,030
welcome and properly educate all the new

110
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:49,590
entrance to JavaScript we are the best

111
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:53,370
and brightest of this community we have

112
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:55,050
an obligation to help those who are

113
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:57,120
trying to learn and understand the

114
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,910
complexities of this language we are the

115
00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:02,990
ones who will benefit the most from it

116
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:05,430
because you know what most of the people

117
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:07,740
entering the language right now they're

118
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:09,169
going to be the ones that are extending

119
00:06:09,169 --> 00:06:13,139
morphing caring feeding and eventually

120
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:15,330
taking over whatever you're working on

121
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:19,550
right now regardless of library

122
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:22,409
framework and even programming language

123
00:06:22,409 --> 00:06:26,490
if everyone knows proper JavaScript

124
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:36,300
a little bit better we all win period so

125
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:38,610
i challenge you to put down your library

126
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:41,310
or your framework preference and write

127
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:43,710
about some interesting facet about the

128
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:46,889
jas language describe how you find

129
00:06:46,889 --> 00:06:49,710
attributes on objects describe what the

130
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:51,810
difference is between an object and

131
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:54,030
array and how you actually tell the two

132
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:56,880
apart anything and everything if you

133
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,250
seek fame and click traffic to your blog

134
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:02,250
right about the entry-level stuff you'll

135
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:04,289
have fifteen thousand hits in the next

136
00:07:04,289 --> 00:07:08,250
week if you seek it if you seek respect

137
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:11,550
and deep dialogues right about the

138
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:13,280
difference between implementations and

139
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,080
methods and convey when do you convey

140
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,090
the wisdom when to use one over the

141
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:21,620
other if writing is too time-consuming

142
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:25,259
or your muse escapes you today I'm

143
00:07:25,259 --> 00:07:27,810
announcing a new campaign promote j/s

144
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:36,889
com the goal of promote guess is this

145
00:07:36,889 --> 00:07:40,380
through pirate technics and guerrilla

146
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:43,280
SEO we can change how search engines

147
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,870
present answers to common queries about

148
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:49,380
our language by driving traffic to the

149
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:51,810
proper documentation we can change

150
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:54,900
everything we can change and ensure that

151
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:57,780
people interested in jazz are connected

152
00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:01,560
with the right educational resources the

153
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,840
first target for promote j/s yeah you

154
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:07,560
guessed it unseat w3schools and put the

155
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:10,080
proper mdn documentation on the first

156
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:18,380
hit

157
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:23,640
quickly I am openly saying to crowd hack

158
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:27,150
google and i'm giving you the code to do

159
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:30,690
it when you go to the site see that

160
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:32,820
little box you copy it in you paste it

161
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:35,160
on your blog it generates a highly

162
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:39,030
valuable high-quality SEO content button

163
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:41,520
that shows you support better

164
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:45,030
documentation for us by us you paste it

165
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:47,460
in everyone gets a unique one and it

166
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:49,710
provides an organic backlink to the

167
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:51,840
right documentation underneath the right

168
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:55,020
query strings you don't believe that

169
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:58,710
this can be done well there's the link

170
00:08:58,710 --> 00:09:00,270
if you need to see it bigger you don't

171
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:01,500
believe this can be done look at what we

172
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:15,590
did in the day we took a zero byte vapor

173
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:18,600
JavaScript framework and we put into the

174
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,970
top of github imagine what we can do in

175
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:26,930
a week we need to be the voice of

176
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:29,850
education for our community we need to

177
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:31,800
promote the proper way of doing things

178
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:34,140
instead of just ignoring those who don't

179
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:38,730
get it or watering things down we need

180
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:40,680
to commit to educating our fellow

181
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:43,770
developers on Jas the language and in

182
00:09:43,770 --> 00:09:46,460
doing so it helps all other frameworks

183
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:50,820
every library meetups conferences the

184
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:56,850
whole shebang promote j/s is a step in

185
00:09:56,850 --> 00:09:58,980
the right direction but it is by no

186
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:02,700
means the end and we need to do more so

187
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:04,920
the more of this chapter is the more

188
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:07,320
people that learn proper jas the better

189
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:12,180
this community will be chapter to love

190
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:15,420
the pirate damn the privateers the

191
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:16,770
technology field has changed

192
00:10:16,770 --> 00:10:18,540
tremendously in the last 20 years and

193
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:21,030
unfortunately it has become almost

194
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:23,010
entirely focused on profiteering and

195
00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:27,180
fame we see companies running technology

196
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:29,830
conferences to profit

197
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:33,310
selling food in metric tons and

198
00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:36,760
making zealots out of noobs con men

199
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:39,310
jumped from one hot tech to the next in

200
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:41,800
order to be the first to sell this

201
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:45,790
week's new hot deal it started with Java

202
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:47,740
and the marketing campaign behind it and

203
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:48,940
the engine that pushed it into the

204
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:51,880
limelight it thrived in the.net

205
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:54,280
ecosphere and came full circle with the

206
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:58,210
hackers in rails the world of software

207
00:10:58,210 --> 00:10:59,950
development has seemed to shift from

208
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:02,010
developing for the betterment of mankind

209
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:05,760
to the slow but strong bleeding of us

210
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:10,030
developers this is not the way of

211
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:12,610
sustainable craftsmanship with in

212
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:15,850
computer science we must turn this trend

213
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:19,390
back we the crowd gathered here those

214
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:21,790
watching at home all of us we be

215
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:25,720
interested oui je s calm have a

216
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:29,110
responsibility to ourselves to change

217
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:32,320
things we are people who can identify

218
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,320
these con men the bad actors in our

219
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,780
community the manipulators we are the

220
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:40,960
ones who have to call them out yes it

221
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:43,570
won't be easy yes they won't go down

222
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:46,060
easy and they sure as hell will fight

223
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:50,860
but it or pirates so I raise the

224
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:56,050
colors thank you

225
00:11:56,050 --> 00:11:58,810
from the beginning of jay's cough doing

226
00:11:58,810 --> 00:12:01,000
what matters versus doing what makes

227
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,310
money has always been a core fundamental

228
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:05,920
to all of us involved on both sides of

229
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:09,130
the pond we are pirates we deeply

230
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:12,279
believe in the code that all ships rise

231
00:12:12,279 --> 00:12:15,820
with the rising tide and that equality

232
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:19,750
for all makes for a proper ship we have

233
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:21,850
no problems addressing the issues in our

234
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:24,310
community opening and calling for a

235
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:27,910
change we must rattle the sabers and

236
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:30,579
shake out those who aren't committed and

237
00:12:30,579 --> 00:12:33,490
we need to do it now because I fear to

238
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:36,160
tell you the establishment is at the

239
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,620
door once again and they are ready to

240
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:43,000
make money off of your work and thus I

241
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,160
say love the pirate damn the privateer

242
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:49,089
privateers for those of you who don't

243
00:12:49,089 --> 00:12:51,640
know where people that posed as pirates

244
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:53,890
and would pillage other country ships

245
00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:57,790
and other pirate ships at the best of a

246
00:12:57,790 --> 00:13:01,120
monarchy or government they were little

247
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,640
more than hired guns paid to discredit

248
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:07,060
pirates and break up colonies they were

249
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:09,640
not in it for life they were not in it

250
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:11,529
for love and they were not in it for

251
00:13:11,529 --> 00:13:14,490
friendship they were in it for money

252
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:19,089
pirates were in it for all three pirates

253
00:13:19,089 --> 00:13:22,540
had a code though it might have differed

254
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:24,339
from ship to ship the general philosophy

255
00:13:24,339 --> 00:13:28,300
of honesty and good faith amongst one

256
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:31,899
another was ever-present this was untrue

257
00:13:31,899 --> 00:13:34,600
for the privateers we need to root out

258
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:37,180
those amongst us who are not here for

259
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:41,079
the reasons that the rest of us are we

260
00:13:41,079 --> 00:13:44,290
need to bring out the people who present

261
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:46,839
themselves as great but provide little

262
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:49,690
to no example and reasoning as to how I

263
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:53,260
say show what you have done let others

264
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:55,870
determine your value not the other way

265
00:13:55,870 --> 00:14:01,380
around anything else is privateering

266
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:03,940
many people think I'm someone important

267
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:06,190
in JavaScript but they've never once

268
00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:07,459
seen my code

269
00:14:07,459 --> 00:14:10,429
or use my code because trust me if they

270
00:14:10,429 --> 00:14:12,350
had they sure as hell wouldn't think

271
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:16,119
that we need to pull down the

272
00:14:16,119 --> 00:14:19,249
unfortunate cult of personality that now

273
00:14:19,249 --> 00:14:23,269
permeates our world it is the only it is

274
00:14:23,269 --> 00:14:26,569
only a device of the privateers of the

275
00:14:26,569 --> 00:14:29,990
businessmen of the marketers of those

276
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:32,480
that would seek to just make a quick

277
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:36,139
buck off of us which is like quarter of

278
00:14:36,139 --> 00:14:40,009
a Europe this is not true this is true

279
00:14:40,009 --> 00:14:41,600
not just for this band of pirates

280
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,480
gathered here under this flag but for

281
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:47,240
all software developers out there we

282
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:49,910
must band together across programming

283
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:51,670
languages we must bring back

284
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:56,300
sustainability sanity love to our

285
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:59,269
profession Douglas Crockford this

286
00:14:59,269 --> 00:15:00,829
morning showed a picture of grace hopper

287
00:15:00,829 --> 00:15:03,139
it's unfortunate that not more people

288
00:15:03,139 --> 00:15:05,990
knew who she was that was the golden era

289
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:08,929
of computer science we need to get back

290
00:15:08,929 --> 00:15:12,799
to that in this I want to openly applaud

291
00:15:12,799 --> 00:15:16,850
Rebecca Murphy for challenging those who

292
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:19,819
champion Enterprise jquery without

293
00:15:19,819 --> 00:15:22,429
offering solutions or frank discussion

294
00:15:22,429 --> 00:15:25,549
about these issues i also want to

295
00:15:25,549 --> 00:15:28,970
applaud z shah for openly speaking out

296
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:30,470
about similar issues in other

297
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:34,369
communities our profession needs more

298
00:15:34,369 --> 00:15:37,399
champions of character and less

299
00:15:37,399 --> 00:15:42,079
and so I make this call to arms love the

300
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:46,009
Pirates damn the privateers with the

301
00:15:46,009 --> 00:15:49,160
deepest sincerity luckily we are

302
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:51,249
starting out almost a new at this point

303
00:15:51,249 --> 00:15:54,889
there is no more Ajax experience there

304
00:15:54,889 --> 00:15:56,749
are a few of any publisher run

305
00:15:56,749 --> 00:16:01,970
conferences in j/s right now we have a

306
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:05,019
developer driven development community

307
00:16:05,019 --> 00:16:07,790
think about that for a second we have

308
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:11,360
the power we are a ship full of pirates

309
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:14,709
we have a beautiful open sea ahead of us

310
00:16:14,709 --> 00:16:20,050
adhere to the code are

311
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:26,710
chapter 3 Sex Lies and comparing sides

312
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:30,060
j/s is not the greatest programming

313
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:35,010
language no program programming language

314
00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:39,840
can ever be they are all at best close

315
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:42,840
approximations to something the computer

316
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:47,220
can understand every programming

317
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:49,290
language has its benefits and its

318
00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:51,900
downfalls we need to get to the point

319
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:54,600
where we realize this and openly admit

320
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:57,110
the negatives along with the positives

321
00:16:57,110 --> 00:16:59,880
we need to stop presenting each new

322
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:02,460
language and framework with zealot asst

323
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:04,650
oh my god this is the best ever

324
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:08,550
I have a legitimate or coming out

325
00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:10,980
with ridiculous metrics that benchmark

326
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:14,450
two things that are not the same or

327
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:17,010
aren't actually benchmarking the

328
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:20,190
appropriate use cases this world is big

329
00:17:20,190 --> 00:17:23,610
enough for all programming languages for

330
00:17:23,610 --> 00:17:29,190
all frameworks and to be honest the

331
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:33,360
world needs all of them not more than a

332
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:36,030
year ago if you would say if you would

333
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:38,220
ask somebody is jas a serious contender

334
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:41,910
in the server space you would have been

335
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:44,130
laughed at probably would been pantsed

336
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:47,490
and feathered same with Ruby if you had

337
00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:49,440
said Ruby 10 years ago you would have

338
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:54,170
been laughed at time changes needs shift

339
00:17:54,170 --> 00:17:57,030
holding the single weapon makes you easy

340
00:17:57,030 --> 00:17:59,910
to combat in a horrible pirate you have

341
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:03,090
no lasting power we are not JavaScript

342
00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:06,210
errs we are not Python ESA's we are not

343
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:10,200
rubyists we are programmers we need to

344
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,990
improve ourselves in as many programming

345
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:15,120
languages as we can wrap our brains

346
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:18,930
around because every language you can

347
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:27,330
you can clap that out

348
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:30,710
every language forces you to view the

349
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:33,860
world in a slightly different way we

350
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:36,490
need to remove the trolls from our world

351
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:40,640
we need to stop comparing sizes we

352
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:43,700
need to be blatantly honest we are all

353
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:47,540
geeks we are not rock stars we are not

354
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:51,730
ninjas luckily though we are all friends

355
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:55,880
confession time I am NOT mr. J humph I

356
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:58,370
am NOT a leader and I'm really not that

357
00:18:58,370 --> 00:19:00,860
good at programming on a good night I

358
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:02,810
can pull together something but it won't

359
00:19:02,810 --> 00:19:06,290
win any awards or medals before I

360
00:19:06,290 --> 00:19:08,000
started yes conf I was completely

361
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,230
unknown like many speakers at Jazz calm

362
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:16,040
for us and you after this I'm going to

363
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:18,020
return back to home work my full-time

364
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:21,740
job in a cubicle and then go home and I

365
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:24,980
enjoy the company of my family I bring

366
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:27,170
this up to make one thing very clear I

367
00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:33,290
am nothing special I am just like every

368
00:19:33,290 --> 00:19:37,670
one of you and honestly I don't want to

369
00:19:37,670 --> 00:19:41,180
be anything special this is not false

370
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:44,150
modesty this is not self deprecation

371
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:48,050
this is honesty an honesty is what we

372
00:19:48,050 --> 00:19:50,420
need to be to ourselves and to our

373
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:54,080
fellow programmers I am most worried

374
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:57,200
about this issue above all others that i

375
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,340
have since that i've previously

376
00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:01,580
discussed it is pride and selfishness

377
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:04,870
that have turned programming from an art

378
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:10,090
into a cesspool it has to stop now we

379
00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:14,920
have to be the ones to do it why why us

380
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:17,960
well simply put because we're an

381
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:21,200
interesting lot because we all come from

382
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,270
different programming languages from

383
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:25,040
different backgrounds from different

384
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:28,550
education from different countries we

385
00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:32,360
span the entire sphere and that's what

386
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:33,260
jay has come

387
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:38,540
is we have a rare opportunity we have

388
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:40,870
the perfect mix of curiosity

389
00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:44,180
intelligence and experience we are

390
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:47,000
sitting at the precipice of an amazing

391
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,470
time and we are an amazing people that

392
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:56,060
is why it is up to us to do this so let

393
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:59,270
this be the start of something great we

394
00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:01,430
are going to improve our community we

395
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:03,370
are not going to let it become a ghetto

396
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:05,990
we are going to do this not for some

397
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:08,690
misguided blind love of a programming

398
00:21:08,690 --> 00:21:11,800
language but because we embrace all

399
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:15,290
programming languages we have the power

400
00:21:15,290 --> 00:21:18,340
and the knowledge to make these changes

401
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:21,770
to make the programming world a better

402
00:21:21,770 --> 00:21:24,920
place and in turn make the entire world

403
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:30,410
a better place we are pirates we r je s
