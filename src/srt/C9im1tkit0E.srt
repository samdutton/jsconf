00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:17,310

so high I hope everyone is having a

2
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:20,970
really great afternoon so I currently

3
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:23,070
work at automatic which is a company

4
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:25,470
behind wordpress com amongst other

5
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:28,830
things and I have this thread of

6
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:31,019
psychology running through my life

7
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:35,489
studies and career and code psychology

8
00:00:35,489 --> 00:00:39,149
really really excites me and I love

9
00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:42,180
doing experiments and I love trying to

10
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:43,680
work out how we can actually create

11
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,620
experiences that connect with others

12
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:50,610
that really really drives me so emotion

13
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:54,600
is a really really powerful thing it

14
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,480
drives us to actions it makes us feel

15
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:00,660
connected and kind of it's an essential

16
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:04,589
part of being human in one day we can

17
00:01:04,589 --> 00:01:07,890
laugh we can cry and weaken sigh and our

18
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:10,680
range of emotions is incredible our face

19
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:14,040
and body show these despite quite often

20
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:17,460
trying to hide them we also have this

21
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:20,009
desire to associate emotions to

22
00:01:20,009 --> 00:01:21,540
inanimate objects and it's something we

23
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:24,840
all do so my laptop for example if it's

24
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,270
not booting it's sad it's feeling grumpy

25
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:29,369
I associate those emotions with it and

26
00:01:29,369 --> 00:01:31,920
if it works expected it's happy it's

27
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,070
having a great day and that's part of

28
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:38,640
the nature as humans we expect things to

29
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,430
have emotions and we all just demand it

30
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:43,350
because without it we kind of feel a

31
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:46,439
little bit uneasy and pics are actually

32
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:48,600
recognize this in their first official

33
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,180
short film called luxo jr. and in this

34
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:54,119
film there's a little lamp which plays

35
00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:57,299
while the big lamp looks on it's kind of

36
00:01:57,299 --> 00:01:59,219
a father and son short in the form of

37
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:04,920
lamps and animals feel emotions too for

38
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:07,229
example look the sheer joy of this dog

39
00:02:07,229 --> 00:02:11,489
running we get comfort in this kind of

40
00:02:11,489 --> 00:02:13,530
cycle of emotion so

41
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:15,600
we recognize joy and then that feeds

42
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:20,940
back into our joy and this is pepper so

43
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:23,700
pepper actually is a humanoid robot

44
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:25,709
designed to live with humans but it's

45
00:02:25,709 --> 00:02:28,680
not task-based pepper actually is a

46
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,989
social robot designed to live

47
00:02:30,989 --> 00:02:34,650
autonomously and to converse recognize

48
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:37,890
and react to your emotions and beyond

49
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:40,319
being super super cute pepper actually

50
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:42,360
as an illustration of how we connect

51
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:45,330
through emotion an emotional companion

52
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:49,680
is actually a perfect fit and because I

53
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,330
like robots I like to show another one

54
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:53,519
for you today and this is power this is

55
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:56,010
actually a therapeutic robot baby harp

56
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:59,340
seal and this is designed by intention

57
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:02,310
to be cute and it's to have a calming

58
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:03,810
effect and emotional response in

59
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:06,470
patients of hospitals and nursing homes

60
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:10,019
so it's kind of the animal version of at

61
00:03:10,019 --> 00:03:12,060
the robot version of animal-assisted

62
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:16,350
therapy power actually has tactile

63
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:19,410
sensors across his body that responds to

64
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:22,230
petting and it can stimulate such

65
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:25,410
emotions as surprise happiness and anger

66
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:28,380
and it also has sound similar to the

67
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:30,750
baby harp seal as well as a sleep and

68
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:35,850
awake cycle so we connect with it humans

69
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:39,780
need we need emotional responses that

70
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:41,970
connection I kind of think we're a

71
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:43,470
little bit like the primate needing a

72
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:47,130
hug the world is a scary place and we

73
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:49,769
need that connection we have a range of

74
00:03:49,769 --> 00:03:51,359
emotions and by understanding emotions

75
00:03:51,359 --> 00:03:55,049
in others we then relate to them samosas

76
00:03:55,049 --> 00:03:57,720
actually are the feelings of the mind

77
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:02,220
just like physiological sensations an

78
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:04,609
emotion actually has three components

79
00:04:04,609 --> 00:04:08,010
these are physiological changes such as

80
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:11,370
increased heart rate behavioral response

81
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:14,420
such as whether you stay or escape and

82
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:17,100
as subjective experience like feeling

83
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:20,820
angry happy or sad and the latter is

84
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:22,890
normally what we associate with being an

85
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:25,640
emotion

86
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:28,680
animation is four years touch the hearts

87
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:32,940
of us from picture to studio ghibli we

88
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:35,669
fallen in love with characters had a

89
00:04:35,669 --> 00:04:37,949
heart broken by ink and

90
00:04:37,949 --> 00:04:41,699
computer-generated images animation

91
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:43,889
connects on a level that touches the

92
00:04:43,889 --> 00:04:47,580
very human heart of us we dive into

93
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:49,169
those animated worlds and we often

94
00:04:49,169 --> 00:04:54,539
escape into them as well studio ghibli

95
00:04:54,539 --> 00:04:58,199
to me show mastery in each of their

96
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:00,090
films as far as bringing a sense of

97
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:02,910
delight goes this is actually an advert

98
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:05,250
they did so this cat we can relate to

99
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:07,889
because it's beyond cute right there's a

100
00:05:07,889 --> 00:05:10,020
sense of delight in its playful batting

101
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:12,539
of the butterfly it's delightful to

102
00:05:12,539 --> 00:05:18,030
watch and it fills you with joy well

103
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:21,180
mrs. a complete contrast the web it's

104
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:23,220
never been very good over late interest

105
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:28,259
as a human interactions often cold clin

106
00:05:28,259 --> 00:05:30,780
clinical because it's not actually a

107
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:34,949
pixar film and it has in the past felt

108
00:05:34,949 --> 00:05:36,539
like the web was created for robots

109
00:05:36,539 --> 00:05:41,340
rather than humans when you only have an

110
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:44,270
interface how do you actually show

111
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:48,650
emotion animation takes advantage of

112
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:51,810
facial features because robots even have

113
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:54,449
them right we show our motion on our

114
00:05:54,449 --> 00:05:57,300
faces but what happens when you have no

115
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:03,030
face so anime and manga actually have a

116
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:05,430
unique visual language that conveys

117
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:08,580
character emotion and these range from

118
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:10,470
speed lines to cryin and something at

119
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:12,419
racal cat mouths it's a bit of an aside

120
00:06:12,419 --> 00:06:13,889
but i'd like to share this with you a

121
00:06:13,889 --> 00:06:16,020
cat mouth is actually when a mouth gross

122
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:18,419
finds and looks like a cat and what it

123
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:21,949
means is the character is feeling catty

124
00:06:21,949 --> 00:06:25,229
so it adds a nerve element beyond the

125
00:06:25,229 --> 00:06:28,199
facial expression to the animation and

126
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:31,550
to us our understanding of the character

127
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:34,620
so a lot of you probably know the book

128
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:36,029
by disney called the illusion of life

129
00:06:36,029 --> 00:06:38,020
disney animation

130
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:40,240
and in that it set trial basic

131
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,900
principles of animation and these kind

132
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:46,210
of create illusion that the object

133
00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:48,819
adheres to the laws of physics but it

134
00:06:48,819 --> 00:06:51,220
actually goes beyond that too emotional

135
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:54,400
timing and character appeal and I feel

136
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,780
when dealing with motion we can probably

137
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:58,180
deal this kind of reduce the 12 down to

138
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:01,110
four and those i'd like to share to that

139
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:03,039
so the first of these would be

140
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:07,599
anticipation anticipation prepares for

141
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:10,690
an action this also focuses attention on

142
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:13,599
an object this could be really useful to

143
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:16,330
show a start of an emotional response or

144
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:20,139
arresting emotion and then we have

145
00:07:20,139 --> 00:07:21,849
timing and this is critical for

146
00:07:21,849 --> 00:07:24,370
conveying emotions and different

147
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:26,530
emotions have different times as well it

148
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:28,030
really can convey the character's

149
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:31,539
personality and then we have

150
00:07:31,539 --> 00:07:34,449
exaggeration this is a little bit of a

151
00:07:34,449 --> 00:07:36,460
double-edged sword because it can be a

152
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:38,349
technique that's actually overused but

153
00:07:38,349 --> 00:07:40,419
where motion is concerned some are

154
00:07:40,419 --> 00:07:43,449
actually exaggerated and this is one

155
00:07:43,449 --> 00:07:44,680
that you can really play around with and

156
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,810
create an emotion in a static element

157
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:49,419
and then you have appeal which is

158
00:07:49,419 --> 00:07:52,330
essential for motion we have to find

159
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:54,460
something appealing so this is kind of

160
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:57,400
if you ever played a kind of D&D this

161
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:00,130
was your charisma kind of amount in that

162
00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:02,590
so we have less of this then you

163
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:04,389
wouldn't simplify so in Disney terms

164
00:08:04,389 --> 00:08:05,830
this would be kind of the villain you

165
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:06,969
wouldn't want to sympathize with the

166
00:08:06,969 --> 00:08:08,979
villain and this is also seen as a

167
00:08:08,979 --> 00:08:14,039
captivation of a character summation

168
00:08:14,039 --> 00:08:18,099
experiences connect with the user they

169
00:08:18,099 --> 00:08:22,300
bring moments of delight an interface

170
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:24,400
can touch you as you interact with it

171
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,560
and when you do that you actually create

172
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,650
a meaningful in connection and that's

173
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:34,089
priceless this is how your users become

174
00:08:34,089 --> 00:08:37,360
really really engaged they create

175
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,550
feelings with your interface and in a

176
00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:41,380
sort of way they're kind of bond with it

177
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:43,539
as a result their investment increases

178
00:08:43,539 --> 00:08:47,170
as they use it so when thinking about

179
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:49,209
emotion I really think you can learn a

180
00:08:49,209 --> 00:08:51,730
lot from apps and I like to share a few

181
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:54,490
today so this is katina and in this this

182
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:56,680
little face look at them as you kind of

183
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:58,660
interact their eyes and you get that

184
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:00,850
kind of feedback you relate and you get

185
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:04,329
that kind of interaction a monument

186
00:09:04,329 --> 00:09:06,160
valley I think can teach an awful lot

187
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,589
about atmosphere and every single

188
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:11,019
interaction layering up to create an

189
00:09:11,019 --> 00:09:13,510
emotional response and a feeling of the

190
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:17,199
world an up coffee shows emotion is it

191
00:09:17,199 --> 00:09:19,120
adds up so it kind of gets more and more

192
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,250
and then it's kind of this whoa kind of

193
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:23,920
as it fills up its so excited to be full

194
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:27,699
and I couldn't not show flappy bird

195
00:09:27,699 --> 00:09:29,740
because the flappy bird to me shows

196
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:32,440
personality right from the start so kind

197
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,570
of it unload the little captures ready

198
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:37,060
to go and to die horribly but it's ready

199
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:39,699
to go and then it refreshes again ready

200
00:09:39,699 --> 00:09:44,139
to go and die horribly again so we have

201
00:09:44,139 --> 00:09:47,139
this ability to create the same animated

202
00:09:47,139 --> 00:09:51,370
emotion in CSS since animations really

203
00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:53,589
exciting to me and the potential is

204
00:09:53,589 --> 00:09:56,230
thrilling and there were tons of

205
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:58,360
experiments like this amazing dozing

206
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:01,420
bird but what about the big of you what

207
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:05,550
about crane an entire experience in CSS

208
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:09,399
the sites we create we should see as a

209
00:10:09,399 --> 00:10:12,790
chance to move the user maybe it's for a

210
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:14,740
reason like this site which we're going

211
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:17,410
to dr appt showing this we're going to

212
00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:19,839
have the demo from this tonight what

213
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:22,089
reason touching someone on an emotional

214
00:10:22,089 --> 00:10:25,750
level is powerful in the past if you

215
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,100
wanted to connect with someone with the

216
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:30,220
same power animation does you use flash

217
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:35,470
or video this is moving it's making a

218
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:37,690
real connection with the human as you

219
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:41,829
use it and this site is how a simple

220
00:10:41,829 --> 00:10:43,660
button connects you with the rest of the

221
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:46,209
animation on the site I think at this

222
00:10:46,209 --> 00:10:47,740
button had a noise it will kind of be

223
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:49,630
boring because that's what this button

224
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:51,819
does as you interact with it and it adds

225
00:10:51,819 --> 00:10:54,730
to the character and the feelings that

226
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:56,680
unites with those UI elements to create

227
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:59,949
the entire experience and knowing the

228
00:10:59,949 --> 00:11:01,750
voice of your site and the brand is

229
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:02,600
really

230
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:05,420
a foundation to know what to kind of

231
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:08,690
emotion you want to revoke and it sets

232
00:11:08,690 --> 00:11:10,130
your emotional tone if you think bats

233
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:12,319
Monument Valley how everything layers up

234
00:11:12,319 --> 00:11:16,220
to create that emotional tone those

235
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:18,350
examples are great but they're big

236
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:21,860
they're showcases it's what an entire

237
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:25,399
animated experience can be and summer

238
00:11:25,399 --> 00:11:27,500
just experiments to test the boundaries

239
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:30,529
of this relatively new format what about

240
00:11:30,529 --> 00:11:32,990
smaller interactions how can we bring a

241
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:37,759
sense of delight to those so animation

242
00:11:37,759 --> 00:11:39,949
isn't just for Co pens or fancy

243
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:42,440
animation flourishes we should be adding

244
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:45,410
it to the smallest of a UI how do we

245
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:48,290
take those exaggerations into smaller

246
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:51,440
forms so like all the examples before

247
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,720
when animation designs for motion is

248
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:56,120
thought of it tends to be in the sense

249
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:58,630
of that entire experience the lead role

250
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:02,620
but these large expenses are incredible

251
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:06,079
but look at this house lack uses the

252
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:07,610
emoji pecker that tiny little

253
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:10,370
interaction that you may hear connection

254
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:12,399
with that doesn't have to be big and

255
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:14,689
cold pen I'm not going to play this is

256
00:12:14,689 --> 00:12:17,180
quite a long animation however the

257
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:18,889
cocaine button is a great attention

258
00:12:18,889 --> 00:12:20,269
grabber because it has different levels

259
00:12:20,269 --> 00:12:22,310
so there's initial kind of wobble and

260
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:24,889
then it kind of gets more and then if

261
00:12:24,889 --> 00:12:26,689
you really don't notice that it sends a

262
00:12:26,689 --> 00:12:29,029
notification box in so to me the

263
00:12:29,029 --> 00:12:32,029
personality of this is it kind of tries

264
00:12:32,029 --> 00:12:33,589
to kind of make a little cough tries to

265
00:12:33,589 --> 00:12:35,120
get your attention then it kind of

266
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,160
shouts a bit and then it gives up and

267
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:41,420
calls its mate notification box in and

268
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:43,279
here's Co pen again I had to share this

269
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:44,959
because copán just has some really nice

270
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:48,350
tiny flourishes this heart unload

271
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:51,829
there's a kind of pulse and then when

272
00:12:51,829 --> 00:12:53,839
you click it it's kind of like you give

273
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:55,699
your heart away that's a really powerful

274
00:12:55,699 --> 00:12:58,339
and simple thing to do as you like

275
00:12:58,339 --> 00:13:01,639
something and what's better than having

276
00:13:01,639 --> 00:13:06,139
toggles kiddie toggles I love this

277
00:13:06,139 --> 00:13:08,180
because it actually shows how you can

278
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:10,009
simply add to previously pouring

279
00:13:10,009 --> 00:13:12,680
standard interface something really fun

280
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:15,350
and interactive and doesn't always have

281
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:16,470
to be cute but it's kind of nice

282
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:18,630
when it is and I just loves you change

283
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:23,580
from no to yes on this so I decided to

284
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:25,800
conduct a bit of an experiment cuz i

285
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:28,470
kind of like doing experiments how can I

286
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:31,260
convey an emotion through simple buttons

287
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:35,040
animation so I set myself a task to have

288
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,260
a series of buttons with various

289
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:40,080
emotions and then do a few tests to see

290
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:44,070
if people got the right emotion so first

291
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:46,620
of all trying to pick what emotion was a

292
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:49,350
little bit tricky I knew I wanted some

293
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:51,540
obvious ones but I also because maybe

294
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:53,340
I'm odd i want to give myself a bit of a

295
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:56,430
challenge so I decided unhappy and angry

296
00:13:56,430 --> 00:13:59,990
and then the challenge would be sad

297
00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:02,520
throughout of all good tests I needed to

298
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,290
set some conditions to really try and

299
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:08,070
get this way and I wanted to kind of

300
00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:09,570
narrow down what I was doing because

301
00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:10,800
there's an awful lot you can do have

302
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,630
animation as an awful lot that can cause

303
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:14,070
bias and someone when they're

304
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:16,950
interacting so I decided to just use

305
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:19,500
ease in and out just use translates and

306
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,450
also to focus on purely just doing

307
00:14:21,450 --> 00:14:24,090
simple keyframes I actually wanted to

308
00:14:24,090 --> 00:14:26,280
kind of get to the lowest denominator

309
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:29,490
and also want to try and make the button

310
00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:31,110
emotionless in its design because as we

311
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:33,180
all know people are influenced by color

312
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:35,100
shape all these kind of other things I

313
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:36,330
want to try and focus on how the

314
00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:39,630
animation could create the design that

315
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:43,770
the actual motion so I started first of

316
00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:47,070
all was happy and as with all good

317
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:49,530
searches I started with animated gifts

318
00:14:49,530 --> 00:14:52,920
and I actually found I'm not sure if

319
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,960
this is a hamster or guinea pig or

320
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:57,480
gerbil but this small furry happy thing

321
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:00,960
I found and to me this happy dance just

322
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:03,390
personify just made me feel happy as

323
00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:06,420
soon as I saw it but I kind of thought I

324
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:09,960
could go happier than that so I thought

325
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:13,200
about minions because minions just exude

326
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:15,630
they just have such happiness it just

327
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:17,370
kind of is exploding for them as they're

328
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:19,920
bouncing up and down so I wanted to

329
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:23,700
bring that into my button so I started

330
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:25,650
to think how the keyframes would look

331
00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:27,510
and I did some really rough graphs

332
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:29,920
however this was me just time

333
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,260
think how it would kind of peak and

334
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:35,769
trough so I kind of thought the happy

335
00:15:35,769 --> 00:15:37,720
button would actually be keen to be used

336
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,130
if you think of the minions they're just

337
00:15:39,130 --> 00:15:41,410
not kind of just grinning that just kind

338
00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:43,329
of can't stop it escaping they're

339
00:15:43,329 --> 00:15:45,279
bouncing so I wanted this button to

340
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:48,160
actually react on load imagine it'd kind

341
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,930
of be so happy it just couldn't help

342
00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:52,120
itself so little happiness blips were

343
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,740
escaping and then when you actually

344
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:55,930
interacted with it it will get even

345
00:15:55,930 --> 00:16:00,100
happier so this is a happy button it's

346
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:02,440
kind of just kind of doing a little and

347
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:04,959
then when you interact with it it just

348
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:07,600
cannot escape so this is my version of a

349
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:12,370
minions in a bun so then I went back to

350
00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:15,670
look at angry and I started think about

351
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:18,639
how the angry button would appear and i

352
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:20,440
found this animated gif and you can see

353
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:24,339
the rock side by side of sheer anger and

354
00:16:24,339 --> 00:16:25,570
i thought this would be good to reflect

355
00:16:25,570 --> 00:16:27,250
particularly in relation to the minion

356
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:28,899
button with the kind of up and down

357
00:16:28,899 --> 00:16:33,370
movement so i went back to drawing rough

358
00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:37,329
graphs and i kind of thought that I

359
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:39,399
wanted to attach a personality this time

360
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:41,589
to its button beyond just kind of the

361
00:16:41,589 --> 00:16:44,140
minion I wanted to actually make you

362
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:46,390
feel that there was a kind of a girl and

363
00:16:46,390 --> 00:16:49,000
a violent shaking so I actually thought

364
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,680
it would be a little bit like poking

365
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:53,199
someone awake so it'd kind of be all

366
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:55,720
quiet and then it'd kind of be a girl

367
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:57,820
get off is what I wanted this the kind

368
00:16:57,820 --> 00:16:59,620
of anger so you kind of get that feeling

369
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:03,130
and this is what I had with angry button

370
00:17:03,130 --> 00:17:06,400
so you interact to kind of get off and

371
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:10,209
it kind of gives that feedback and then

372
00:17:10,209 --> 00:17:14,290
it kind of a second so sad but and I

373
00:17:14,290 --> 00:17:15,850
knew just going to be a bit of a

374
00:17:15,850 --> 00:17:19,000
challenge because sadness is quite a

375
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,160
wide range and it's quite hard to convey

376
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:24,309
and one person sad really isn't another

377
00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:28,419
person's sadness I did a bit of search

378
00:17:28,419 --> 00:17:31,650
and I found this heartbreaking Pikachu

379
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:34,210
this kind of all the sad I can't watch

380
00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:35,620
it for too long because it's just too

381
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:40,240
sad however this to me conveyed the

382
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,610
little trembling I just like that's just

383
00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:44,250
a universal for

384
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:47,200
so I then thought about how that I would

385
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,450
actually look in a graph and it's kind

386
00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:50,890
of quite you can see the difference in

387
00:17:50,890 --> 00:17:53,110
the emotion in the grass I'm creating

388
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:55,870
and I thought this is kind of be a

389
00:17:55,870 --> 00:17:57,760
reluctant button and I cited think of

390
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:00,880
how it'd almost be that sad sighing and

391
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,160
this would be on click and it would be

392
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,480
kind of reluctant there would be this

393
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,370
kind of time delay when we're going back

394
00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:08,020
to timing this really would come into

395
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:12,790
play with sadness so sad Burton is

396
00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:15,490
actually really sad it's actually quite

397
00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:19,360
a slight emotion but you interact its

398
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:23,520
kind of that's what the button does so I

399
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:27,160
then went on to test on some humans I

400
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:30,490
did five initial 121 test because I just

401
00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:32,200
wanted to see whether i was crazy

402
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,760
developing these buttons by myself

403
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:36,010
wherever I was actually conveying these

404
00:18:36,010 --> 00:18:39,640
emotions I used cope n to share and I

405
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:42,460
asked a simple question of what emotion

406
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:46,480
does this button feel and I really want

407
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,010
to do some more after this if I wanted

408
00:18:48,010 --> 00:18:49,780
kind of a baseline by asking and then

409
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:52,240
refining and with that I actually

410
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:55,960
presented three emotions to the person

411
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,580
and ask them to select them and the

412
00:18:57,580 --> 00:19:00,280
reason I did this was you could get five

413
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:02,620
hugging in lots of different words for

414
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:04,840
the same emotion I wanted to really try

415
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:08,020
and pin it down at least initially so

416
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:11,350
his results happy Burton got five people

417
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:14,290
which I was really pleased about also

418
00:19:14,290 --> 00:19:15,520
the feedback I got was really

419
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,200
interesting considering I base that on

420
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,920
minions which people said it was rushed

421
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:22,809
excited and anxious anxious was

422
00:19:22,809 --> 00:19:24,730
interesting but anxious can actually be

423
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:28,120
very close to excitable happiness so

424
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:31,030
that was kind of on the money with what

425
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:34,780
was said in an angry button or five

426
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:37,960
people definitely said that button was

427
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:40,780
angry and also what was interesting

428
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:42,790
relating to the kind of girl get off

429
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:46,870
people also said it was annoyed so it

430
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:50,830
kind of was giving that feeling this is

431
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:53,650
where I got a bit tricky sad Burton all

432
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:56,340
five people did say it was sad however

433
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:58,119
people actually

434
00:19:58,119 --> 00:19:59,859
you were saying if I have to pick one

435
00:19:59,859 --> 00:20:03,279
it'll be sad so I don't I sad button was

436
00:20:03,279 --> 00:20:05,349
not a success and I knew this was going

437
00:20:05,349 --> 00:20:06,969
to be hard to sads actually some things

438
00:20:06,969 --> 00:20:08,889
that's really difficult to convey and

439
00:20:08,889 --> 00:20:11,739
the feedback was quite varied such as it

440
00:20:11,739 --> 00:20:14,589
was stoned it was sleepy reluctant and

441
00:20:14,589 --> 00:20:17,349
bored maybe that kind of applies to the

442
00:20:17,349 --> 00:20:19,599
same but it kind of indicates I really

443
00:20:19,599 --> 00:20:21,909
wasn't on the hannah on target foot

444
00:20:21,909 --> 00:20:24,939
being sad and one of the feedbacks I

445
00:20:24,939 --> 00:20:27,669
actually got was that happy and angry

446
00:20:27,669 --> 00:20:30,339
reminded them of their kid which to me

447
00:20:30,339 --> 00:20:32,049
was great considering I based on a

448
00:20:32,049 --> 00:20:33,879
minion and that kind of girl get off

449
00:20:33,879 --> 00:20:39,489
kind of childish thing so that's a fun

450
00:20:39,489 --> 00:20:41,379
experiment I like doing things like that

451
00:20:41,379 --> 00:20:43,359
and I want to do more of those emotions

452
00:20:43,359 --> 00:20:45,429
because to me it was really a useful

453
00:20:45,429 --> 00:20:48,579
experiment how can you actually take

454
00:20:48,579 --> 00:20:50,979
that into the interfaces you create how

455
00:20:50,979 --> 00:20:52,719
can we take that beyond those kind of

456
00:20:52,719 --> 00:20:56,949
cute angry experiments for buttons so

457
00:20:56,949 --> 00:20:59,889
invisible animation can be said to be

458
00:20:59,889 --> 00:21:01,979
the one that creates the most profound

459
00:21:01,979 --> 00:21:07,209
emotions well animation is good you

460
00:21:07,209 --> 00:21:09,759
don't notice that and a lot of the

461
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:12,099
experiments I'm doing focus on smaller

462
00:21:12,099 --> 00:21:15,189
elements thats aligned this it's also

463
00:21:15,189 --> 00:21:17,159
about adding to the experience and

464
00:21:17,159 --> 00:21:19,449
causing reaction that subconscious if

465
00:21:19,449 --> 00:21:21,099
you think about Monument Valley again i

466
00:21:21,099 --> 00:21:23,139
keep on going back to it because it

467
00:21:23,139 --> 00:21:26,319
layers up to create that experience it's

468
00:21:26,319 --> 00:21:28,509
what animation film students what Pixar

469
00:21:28,509 --> 00:21:30,489
do it's what you do Ghibli do they add

470
00:21:30,489 --> 00:21:32,589
these layers to create the whole entire

471
00:21:32,589 --> 00:21:34,749
experience and that's what we can be

472
00:21:34,749 --> 00:21:38,019
doing the smaller elements so I did a

473
00:21:38,019 --> 00:21:39,519
couple more experiments that I'd like to

474
00:21:39,519 --> 00:21:41,879
share at the end of this talk with you

475
00:21:41,879 --> 00:21:46,269
and one of those scoffing buttons so

476
00:21:46,269 --> 00:21:48,849
this is I was trying to play around with

477
00:21:48,849 --> 00:21:51,129
how I could take a subtle emotion into a

478
00:21:51,129 --> 00:21:53,529
simple interface so what's the coffin

479
00:21:53,529 --> 00:21:57,429
bone it's quite simply in the form of a

480
00:21:57,429 --> 00:21:59,919
button so it's may be very English noise

481
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:03,759
but it's basically doing that it's not

482
00:22:03,759 --> 00:22:06,819
loud it's so but it's just enough to

483
00:22:06,819 --> 00:22:09,720
grab attention

484
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:11,680
and this is my version of a coughing

485
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:14,530
button so it's kind of just in the

486
00:22:14,530 --> 00:22:17,800
corner I want to play around with this a

487
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,390
little bit more it's just my first stab

488
00:22:19,390 --> 00:22:21,340
at coughing buttons but it shows how you

489
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,640
can just have a simple attention grabber

490
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:26,260
and the other thing I've side a look at

491
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:29,350
phone calls n inputs and this is really

492
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:31,480
really subtle it's part of that layering

493
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:33,310
and adding two different things to how

494
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:35,680
even an input could be just SAT there

495
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:39,760
adding to that atmosphere the simple is

496
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,560
quietly waiting that's why it's called

497
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:43,210
Zen it's just quietly doing its own

498
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:45,490
thing and you're not meant to notice it

499
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:47,590
until you interact and it stops moving

500
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:50,080
that's when you probably notice it don't

501
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,000
know how this is going to convey on the

502
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,610
big screen but it's just ever ever so

503
00:22:54,610 --> 00:22:57,480
slightly making a little bit of movement

504
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:00,700
and I almost wanted you to not notice it

505
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:02,740
was moving but kind of register it's

506
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:04,060
moving so you kind of get that feeling

507
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:09,270
but you you don't know so all these

508
00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:12,820
experiments are great and fun to do well

509
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:14,950
for me there but a lot of them come down

510
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:18,190
to feedback this is when the user

511
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:21,370
interacts and gets an emotion back it's

512
00:23:21,370 --> 00:23:23,320
the same thing that we relate to the

513
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:25,180
robots we get that emotional feedback

514
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:27,370
back while we relate to animals we get

515
00:23:27,370 --> 00:23:31,960
that feedback as well for example if you

516
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:34,890
click a button and you make it Angry or

517
00:23:34,890 --> 00:23:37,630
if you add input into a field and make

518
00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:40,110
it hold its breath as you do that

519
00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:42,370
feedback isn't the only way to show

520
00:23:42,370 --> 00:23:44,410
emotion through CSS but it can be really

521
00:23:44,410 --> 00:23:46,030
really effective one and quite a low

522
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:48,850
entry point humans we seek that

523
00:23:48,850 --> 00:23:51,640
emotional feedback and this is a great

524
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:56,320
way that we can interact through CSS

525
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:59,710
animation we can bring personality to

526
00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:02,890
interactions buttons can be impatient or

527
00:24:02,890 --> 00:24:06,190
happy a sliding panel might be eager to

528
00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:09,880
actually be opened I'm input field might

529
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:12,390
be impatient to have content added to it

530
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:15,880
motion is powerful and we can really use

531
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:20,560
it to connect to users motion makes

532
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,890
interfaces more human

533
00:24:22,890 --> 00:24:25,820
and as humans we then connect with that

534
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:29,010
cleaner interface you feel connected to

535
00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:32,370
is incredibly powerful maybe it's a

536
00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:34,380
grand showcase that tugs at the

537
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:36,840
heartstrings but we should be also

538
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:38,100
looking at the smaller details and I

539
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:40,680
hope I've shown that today since this is

540
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:43,140
really really powerful and we can bring

541
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:45,210
a little bit of emotion to any aspect

542
00:24:45,210 --> 00:24:48,540
the interface so thank you so much

543
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:50,190
listening to me I'm going to be around

544
00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:52,230
all day so please come and say hi as I

545
00:24:52,230 --> 00:24:54,690
love meeting new people and I'd be happy
