1
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:28,349

oh cool awesome i got gun all right so

2
00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:31,140
not I think we're aware that not

3
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:34,559
everyone knows why we're here what this

4
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:38,910
is but we used to be a fun podcast about

5
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:41,610
JavaScript in front end development in

6
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:44,160
fact no big deal but brendan eich did

7
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,760
start his 2011 John visconti you keynote

8
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,729
with so I was watching a curry the other

9
00:00:50,729 --> 00:00:53,580
day so not too bad no big deal no big

10
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:55,769
deal we were also one of the top two

11
00:00:55,769 --> 00:00:59,580
podcast focusing on jQuery um also one

12
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:01,710
of the only two podcasts focusing on

13
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:06,150
jQuery from 2009-12 2011 um very popular

14
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:07,860
among people who watched podcasts about

15
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:10,920
jQuery and this year we got invited to

16
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,450
this year's jas comp after being the

17
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:17,040
lunchtime entertainment at the 2010 the

18
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,750
notes say 11 but I knew that was wrong

19
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:22,469
uh so you shouldn't expect to learn a

20
00:01:22,469 --> 00:01:24,509
whole lot because we're really more

21
00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:29,070
about being stupid but so obviously for

22
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:31,200
those of you who aren't up to speed on

23
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,880
what we do we we've compiled kind of a

24
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:40,789
greatest-hits montage of you know our

25
00:01:40,789 --> 00:01:47,670
greatest hits ah so that's we're going

26
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:49,409
to roll that for you right now after we

27
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:51,359
give you a little background oftentimes

28
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:54,479
Adam would either just nail a sec way or

29
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:56,520
just really bomb them and so I'm glad

30
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,079
you guys were able to get a taste of him

31
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:02,819
really bombing one so a little

32
00:02:02,819 --> 00:02:05,819
background on how this starts a lot of

33
00:02:05,819 --> 00:02:07,170
people saw this in the show but we never

34
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:08,250
gave the background it so we thought

35
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:11,150
we'd give some behind the scenes info

36
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:14,220
okay so clap is like our etherpad that

37
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:15,270
use and a lot of people actually

38
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:17,250
probably seen something on Ethan okay so

39
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:20,310
clap before in the first episode I was

40
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:21,840
the editor and for a few I was the

41
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,590
really bad quality ones and Paul every

42
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:27,450
time you would start a sentence he like

43
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:31,080
okay so any clap his hands and I just

44
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,069
got really tired of it so I

45
00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:34,260
register the domain and gifted it to him

46
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:38,400
so we ended up using that as the way we

47
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,810
would sync audio in the beginning of

48
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:41,790
episode so that's the story behind okay

49
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:44,430
so clap and how our montage starts boo

50
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:48,510
boo boo that's montage sound uh we

51
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:52,790
should do a klappa club lemme yeah sure

52
00:02:52,790 --> 00:03:33,740
Alex oh wow oh yeah perfect

53
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:41,110
cuz we know this is not the jQuery

54
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:45,930
podcast but instead this is the yay-hey

55
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:50,290
query the Y a query podcast so we just

56
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:52,240
basically wanted to have a very casual

57
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,190
conversation about what's going on in

58
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:56,080
the jQuery in front end adame community

59
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:59,800
I think it might be time for a segment

60
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:05,050
that we like to call get up if you

61
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:08,380
missed it last year ge'ez conf 2010 is

62
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:10,810
on the horizon we loved Paul and I were

63
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:12,730
at this conference and I think everybody

64
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:14,650
here has actually signed up already

65
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:17,049
because it was just the best conference

66
00:04:17,049 --> 00:04:19,000
of the year this year

67
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,720
you wanna talk call a gay query party

68
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,870
line this is Michael Taylor are you

69
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:27,970
saying there's a map method on a jQuery

70
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:29,410
object and there's also a map method

71
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:33,490
just on the jQuery the jQuery name space

72
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:36,570
itself much like after and before

73
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:39,400
Columbus's voyage to the New World there

74
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:42,070
are two different maps that we're

75
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:45,490
working with here all and I think we're

76
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:47,170
going to leave you with that along with

77
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:49,810
our best turkey impressions and a

78
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:59,050
Jonathan Neal song ultimately at its

79
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:00,760
core it's just JavaScript and what we're

80
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:04,150
focusing on is making JavaScript the

81
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:06,880
first class language that it is right

82
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,740
well anyway thirteen percent is like

83
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:10,750
it's more than 10 so I think that's

84
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:13,390
worth talking about it's not third to

85
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:18,310
set it's more than German speaking of

86
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:28,210
Jonathan nail in addition to console dot

87
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:30,760
log there's also console dot der ER and

88
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:35,740
ER door gir burn everybody that I think

89
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:39,700
console that di are also we found the

90
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:43,260
complete bunnies guide to jquery this

91
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:45,640
that's what we're calling it cuz we

92
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:48,130
can't read Japanese that are jquery for

93
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:51,030
bunnies or I think it's time for the

94
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:56,680
plug-in it's really really great with

95
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:00,669

00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:19,950
of people will always want to do stupid

149
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:21,780

whoo I'll never do that again um so you

164
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:26,460
guys may have figured out by now that

165
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:31,080
there's no backlog of podcasts but uh

166
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:33,360
you know ultimately we're really proud

167
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,830
because what we realized was we kind of

168
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:38,520
kicked off a new generation of content

169
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,020
where people could just delve into

170
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:40,980
whatever they want it so he obviously

171
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:43,710
saw you know the first take on this was

172
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:48,480
the Danai query segment with Pete um but

173
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,790
then we were really surprised to find

174
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:54,890
out that then there was the naquin

175
00:10:54,890 --> 00:10:57,480
starting the fruit strike zebra and you

176
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,860
know that's where horse jas got his

177
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:01,830
start and then from there it really

178
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:05,250
started taking off our Canadian our

179
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:10,620
Canadian friend God mom so the crazy

180
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:11,940
thing about this is when it really

181
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:14,370
started going viral because I Darcy

182
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:17,100
Clark wasn't the only Darcy Clarke who

183
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:18,600
wanted to get in on this turns out

184
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:21,029
there's a body builder named Darcy Clark

185
00:11:21,029 --> 00:11:24,630
on and hey and a female bodybuilder a

186
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:26,790
protein shake and and just pile of whey

187
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:30,779
protein started way query um and the

188
00:11:30,779 --> 00:11:32,400
Scripps Howard network owners of the

189
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,750
Food Network realized that like

190
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:37,110
inanimate objects are just stalking for

191
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:39,900
30 minutes was a great great content

192
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:42,570
idea so that's where they did on full a

193
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:47,610
query uh Benny a query chicken satay

194
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:51,480
query and of course then three

195
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,730
crustaceans and a supercomputer joined

196
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:59,850
together for Creek query I know what you

197
00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:02,040
guys are all thinking that shits Cray

198
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:04,910
but that should what's really cry is

199
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:07,899
Kanye query

200
00:12:07,899 --> 00:12:11,179
but you know ultimately Kanye query

201
00:12:11,179 --> 00:12:12,709
turned out to be kind of shitty and you

202
00:12:12,709 --> 00:12:13,999
kind of wanted to wash yourself

203
00:12:13,999 --> 00:12:16,610
afterwards so that's why there was but a

204
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:20,569
query but then I showed that to my

205
00:12:20,569 --> 00:12:22,879
grandmother and she was like oh hey

206
00:12:22,879 --> 00:12:28,459
query um and we but we knew we were

207
00:12:28,459 --> 00:12:29,929
going to start to jump the shark when

208
00:12:29,929 --> 00:12:32,119
like the mainstream entertainment kind

209
00:12:32,119 --> 00:12:36,800
of got involved and um a whip wax a tie

210
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,379
and fifty actual Shades of Grey joint

211
00:12:39,379 --> 00:12:43,189
for fifty Shades of Grey query and then

212
00:12:43,189 --> 00:12:46,309
Hollywood got in on the action with of

213
00:12:46,309 --> 00:12:51,410
course Michael Bay query and you know we

214
00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:53,300
had you know this really just goes on

215
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:55,999
and on we have at least 20 unused shitty

216
00:12:55,999 --> 00:13:03,589
jokes regulo we're going to turn this on

217
00:13:03,589 --> 00:13:05,899
its head and I'm go back to our roots

218
00:13:05,899 --> 00:13:10,100
from gamescom 2010 and do a game show

219
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:16,249
it's uh it's game time cool so we did a

220
00:13:16,249 --> 00:13:18,649
game show where we called like groups of

221
00:13:18,649 --> 00:13:20,600
ten up last time during lunch everyone's

222
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,149
trying to eat now my god leave us alone

223
00:13:22,149 --> 00:13:24,139
but we were in there and you couldn't

224
00:13:24,139 --> 00:13:26,689
really ignore us and so this time we're

225
00:13:26,689 --> 00:13:28,399
going to let you stay in your seats and

226
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:30,589
you're going to be able to vote with

227
00:13:30,589 --> 00:13:32,809
your phones or you can use your

228
00:13:32,809 --> 00:13:35,360
internet-connected device in order to

229
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:38,149
vote so we have URL do I say that yet I

230
00:13:38,149 --> 00:13:39,379
don't know that I don't remember the

231
00:13:39,379 --> 00:13:44,079
order I'm sorry so sorry so basically on

232
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:46,639
bootstrap is obviously taken off like

233
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:49,220
gangbusters the last couple years and

234
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:53,029
Jacob Thornton fat obviously maintainer

235
00:13:53,029 --> 00:13:55,429
of that you know great personality great

236
00:13:55,429 --> 00:13:58,429
guy so we decided to put together a game

237
00:13:58,429 --> 00:14:08,360
show called dead fat tweet that oh so if

238
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:10,639
you followed that or even if you don't I

239
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:13,040
you know you'll probably be able to play

240
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,749
along so here are the rules we're going

241
00:14:14,749 --> 00:14:17,600
to post the content of a tweet fat may

242
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,070
or may not have tweeted

243
00:14:19,070 --> 00:14:22,220
are you can go to poli vcom / jquery

244
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:24,920
each of the poles will have a text code

245
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:28,550
you can tweet to a text 2 2 2 333 or you

246
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:31,780
can tweet the code at at pole and the y

247
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:35,690
at pole way to go guys um must know

248
00:14:35,690 --> 00:14:39,140
someone at Twitter all right so we're

249
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:41,900
going to roll that do that right now and

250
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:43,820
will give you like 15 30 seconds to

00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:01,640
this one says I'm really excited about

256
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,380
the upcoming bootstrap 3 release

257
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:06,830
congrats to all involved impeccable

258
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:13,130
grammar a lot of fakes on this one all

259
00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:18,470
right should we reveal yeah yeah that's

260
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:20,660

00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:23,660
results it is fake it is fake yeah I

262
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:25,880

297
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,190
been to this is the last one guys to

298
00:17:55,190 --> 00:18:01,880
make account and it looks like it's real

299
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:06,220
it is real good look everybody all right

300
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:08,650
like you guys got like 50 prick crowd

301
00:18:08,650 --> 00:18:18,610
was 50 55 next segment all right so we

302
00:18:18,610 --> 00:18:21,039
had a segment before it was called let's

303
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:22,780
see if I can play this you want to play

304
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:28,000
for me it's like a come on oh yeah

305
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,620
that's cool let's do that oh it's not

306
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:43,210
that one no come on so this was one of

307
00:18:43,210 --> 00:18:44,919
our favorite segments but we wanted to

308
00:18:44,919 --> 00:18:46,240
kind of like summarize all the things

309
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,590
that we learned over the past few years

310
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:49,230
and kind of contextualize it and so

311
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:51,460
polish is jQuery anti-pattern for

312
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:56,559
performance of the decade is polishes

313
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:58,840
anti a pattern for performance of the

314
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:02,980
week so basically I wanted to just

315
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:07,360
apologize um I got caught up in like the

316
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,130
shiny performance optimizations the

317
00:19:09,130 --> 00:19:10,179
kinds of things that you might see on

318
00:19:10,179 --> 00:19:13,030
Jas perf and just like really dig into

319
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:15,190
those little micro things that overall

320
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:17,710
in the big picture don't really teach a

321
00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:24,549
whole lot demo all right Rebecca said

322
00:19:24,549 --> 00:19:26,380
you might not learn anything but we're

323
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:27,850
going to try something here so very

324
00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:30,340
quickly I just wanted to point out Jess

325
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:32,230
when it comes to a speed perspective

326
00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:33,970
especially on websites right jess is

327
00:19:33,970 --> 00:19:35,440
often a small fraction of the picture

328
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,390
both unlike load time and on runtime

329
00:19:37,390 --> 00:19:40,150
these are actually stats from when ie8

330
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:41,740
was released there was a good talk about

331
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:44,590
ie a performance but this is as true as

332
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:47,620
it was today as it was then I looked at

333
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:50,440
like the amount of JavaScript I was only

334
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,669
contribute to thirty three percent of

335
00:19:51,669 --> 00:19:54,580
the time spent on the cpu on like google

336
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:56,770
maps and gmail but like regular web

337
00:19:56,770 --> 00:19:58,299
sites around sixteen percent not a big

338
00:19:58,299 --> 00:20:01,419
deal and so what i want to do is kind of

339
00:20:01,419 --> 00:20:04,960
show you a more realistic view of

340
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,730
overall performance so what I have here

341
00:20:06,730 --> 00:20:08,740
is kind of this infographic e parallax

342
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:11,200
site quickly going to scroll through it

343
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,789
just to kind of show you what it looks

344
00:20:12,789 --> 00:20:15,370
like so we got kind of this explosion

345
00:20:15,370 --> 00:20:17,230
thing and then over here this little

346
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:18,970
physics ii dots ago

347
00:20:18,970 --> 00:20:21,880
hmm it's fun and then this action

348
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:24,190
parallax II fun stuff and then I keep

349
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:25,630
going down and then there's these dots

350
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:27,100
that kind of explode all over the place

351
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:28,539
it's pretty cool but what I'm going to

352
00:20:28,539 --> 00:20:31,240
do is go back to the very top lit up

353
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:33,520
timeline and the chrome devtools and

354
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:36,820
frames mode start recording and then

355
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:37,750
we're going to scroll through the page

356
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:41,110
again same kind of deal but what you're

357
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:42,610
seeing on the bottom all these bars

358
00:20:42,610 --> 00:20:45,010
coming up through is is that's giving

359
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:46,330
them the idea of the kinds of operations

360
00:20:46,330 --> 00:20:47,890
that the browser is doing in this whole

361
00:20:47,890 --> 00:20:58,679
time no I just hit close tab because

362
00:20:58,679 --> 00:21:05,770
seems normal ouch all right frames mode

363
00:21:05,770 --> 00:21:08,440
oh yeah yeah so worked so what we're

364
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:10,480
looking at here is kind of the

365
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,640
performance adds a narrative of going

366
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,470
through this operation towards the

367
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:16,720
beginning this green section here is

368
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,940
paints we have really heavy painting and

369
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:20,830
this is as all these orange bubbles are

370
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:22,299
coming in let me go into a bunch of

371
00:21:22,299 --> 00:21:23,980
yellow this is during the physics

372
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:26,260
operation here this is actual JavaScript

373
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:28,030
being a pretty heavy then it's pretty

374
00:21:28,030 --> 00:21:29,650
chill in the middle for the most part

375
00:21:29,650 --> 00:21:32,559
we're hitting our frame budget goals and

376
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:35,080
down towards the bottom we have this

377
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:38,409
kind of white explosion and there's kind

378
00:21:38,409 --> 00:21:40,090
of a lot of operations including a good

379
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:41,559
amount of purple spent in here this is a

380
00:21:41,559 --> 00:21:44,620
time spent and layout but this gives us

381
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:46,090
a good view of kind of like all the

382
00:21:46,090 --> 00:21:48,490
things that are going on so that like

383
00:21:48,490 --> 00:21:50,200
for each segment there is actually a

384
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:52,600
specific well there are predominant

385
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,130
bottlenecks and this gives a good idea

386
00:21:54,130 --> 00:21:56,380
of how to adjust this paint here

387
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:58,570
JavaScript here and if we wanted to find

388
00:21:58,570 --> 00:22:00,250
out kind of what we could do for

389
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:02,320
JavaScript I think Peter Flynn from

390
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:05,039
Adobe showed this just the other day

391
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:08,200
record a CPU profile and switch over to

392
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:10,919
the new flame chart and get a view of

393
00:22:10,919 --> 00:22:13,600
overtime kind of at each frame you know

394
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,159
what's the consistency of frames here

395
00:22:15,159 --> 00:22:18,159
and what are we looking at per frame is

396
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:20,320
minified but you know you get what I'm

397
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:23,679
saying all right enough a useful content

398
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:25,750
let's go back to the show

399
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:28,930
yeah whoo so obviously as you may have

400
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:30,880
seen the plugin of the week was one of

401
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:35,050
our most cherished segments um you know

402
00:22:35,050 --> 00:22:37,060
one mention on yake free plugin of the

403
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:38,230
week pretty soon you have like a

404
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:40,630
successful startup in a book deal true

405
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:43,930
wilson arm and but the thing is nowadays

406
00:22:43,930 --> 00:22:46,150
when people release jQuery plugins they

407
00:22:46,150 --> 00:22:47,470
end up on Acra news and everyone's like

408
00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:48,730
you know what the fuck is this bullshit

409
00:22:48,730 --> 00:22:51,280
why would you bother like robbing some

410
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:53,020
simple iteration sugar around like

411
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:54,340
something useful when you could be a

412
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:59,890
dick and not do that ah ah so as you can

413
00:22:59,890 --> 00:23:02,590
see uh you know here's a hacker research

414
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:04,600
for why is this a jquery plugin just a

415
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:08,590
small snippet on so that's why when we

416
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:10,270
come up here to jas count we know

417
00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:12,040
everyone's really sophisticated and if

418
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:13,060
we're going to tell you about a plugin

419
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:14,680
we want to be something that's really

420
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:15,850
modular we want it to be something

421
00:23:15,850 --> 00:23:17,980
that's useful in you know a broad

422
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:19,750
variety of situations but most

423
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:21,190
importantly we want it to be something

424
00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:22,960
that inspires thoughts of a romantic

425
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,030
walk in the enchanted woods with notes

426
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:26,950
of apricot nectar but most the petals

427
00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:30,190
and tuscan cypress that's why our plugin

428
00:23:30,190 --> 00:23:32,050
of the week for this week is the bed and

429
00:23:32,050 --> 00:23:34,570
bath and body works well flowers

430
00:23:34,570 --> 00:23:36,850
signature collection twilight woods to

431
00:23:36,850 --> 00:23:43,450
pack refill boom alright so back in back

432
00:23:43,450 --> 00:23:44,770
in two thousand nine when we got started

433
00:23:44,770 --> 00:23:47,230
with this podcast we were kind of

434
00:23:47,230 --> 00:23:48,220
looking to the future because that's

435
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:50,050
what what this podcast is about was was

436
00:23:50,050 --> 00:23:51,550
being smart people looking to the future

437
00:23:51,550 --> 00:23:53,920
and and so way back then we put together

438
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:58,270
a time capsule doubtful umm that smells

439
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:01,990
like the beer from yesterday uh it does

440
00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:04,510
no really so so we don't really remember

441
00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:06,700
what's in here but but we're going to

442
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:08,650
read these these predictions that we

443
00:24:08,650 --> 00:24:11,890
made from from back in 2009 about what

444
00:24:11,890 --> 00:24:14,380
the world would be like when when we

445
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:18,160
were here in 24 2013 it's a good thing

446
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,480
someone else is unfolding these because

447
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:21,730
microphone all right protection number

448
00:24:21,730 --> 00:24:23,410
one jquery will need to come out with a

449
00:24:23,410 --> 00:24:24,940
web app framework in order to remain

450
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:28,430
relevant

451
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:33,830
uh is John Dalton in here somewhere Oh

452
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:43,350
fuse j/s will be released oh yeah we

453
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:45,090
will definitely have modules in

454
00:24:45,090 --> 00:24:51,210
JavaScript i I don't I don't I don't

455
00:24:51,210 --> 00:25:00,540
think I should i do it no Paul's 15

456
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:06,630
minutes of fame will be over yeah I

457
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:13,060
don't know who wrote that hard to say uh

458
00:25:13,070 --> 00:25:16,200
Apple Apple will totally cave on that

459
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:21,600
whole flash thing last one last one all

460
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,970
right we weren't very even about this

461
00:25:23,970 --> 00:25:26,310
but thats that's all right jayus comp

462
00:25:26,310 --> 00:25:28,500
seems like a nice idea but the Ajax

463
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:30,420
experience has way too much developer

464
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:37,170
mind chair for it to ever take off all

465
00:25:37,170 --> 00:25:39,480
right so we just wanted to shout a thank

466
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:41,340

then we'll slowly come back and get our
