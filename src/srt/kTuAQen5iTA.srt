1
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:09,889

you don't wanna step on all the candy

2
00:00:09,889 --> 00:00:14,990
that's a lot there hi so my talk is

3
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:16,730
called the other side of empathy and

4
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:18,080
I'll get into what that exactly means

5
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,779
pretty soon but a kind of apt

6
00:00:20,779 --> 00:00:23,480
description is kind of an intro into

7
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:27,949
encouraging exemplifying empathy so

8
00:00:27,949 --> 00:00:34,240
again hello so who am i why am i up here

9
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:39,530
how did I get here so i am nick her hair

10
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:42,710
if you're from Germany I am first and

11
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:44,840
foremost an empathetic community member

12
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:48,020
I am a maintainer of the one of the

13
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:49,910
hoodie projects one of the many

14
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:51,470
different modules that they have and

15
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:56,450
they put out I am recently a tehsil to

16
00:00:56,450 --> 00:00:59,990
hustle project team member and I am also

17
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:02,810
an organizer of a meetup in New York

18
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:05,509
called Manhattan jas so one of the many

19
00:01:05,509 --> 00:01:07,070
barojah so yeah we had a couple of

20
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:08,000
people here tonight who have spoken

21
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,030
there too and then you can find me

22
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:13,670
online at a hipster brown so look for

23
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:15,020
charlie brown with a mustache and that's

24
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:17,299
me and if you may have noticed now I

25
00:01:17,299 --> 00:01:21,469
have a pretty wicked mustache but

26
00:01:21,469 --> 00:01:23,840
important thing to note as it's not to

27
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,999
be touched it may sound like a weird

28
00:01:25,999 --> 00:01:28,939
request but it's happened before so just

29
00:01:28,939 --> 00:01:32,840
going to put it out there so yeah why am

30
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,130
I here talking about empathy why do I

31
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:38,299
care so much about it I could say it's

32
00:01:38,299 --> 00:01:40,130
because I study psychology and

33
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:42,590
leadership in college and not really CS

34
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:45,109
but really learn more about how people

35
00:01:45,109 --> 00:01:48,829
work together it could be because I as a

36
00:01:48,829 --> 00:01:51,049
front-end developer I'm causative

37
00:01:51,049 --> 00:01:52,520
collaborating with different types of

38
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,709
people different backgrounds Putte

39
00:01:54,709 --> 00:01:59,060
designers or developers but for the most

40
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:01,429
part it's just because I love community

41
00:02:01,429 --> 00:02:04,700
and the JavaScript community and the web

42
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:06,740
development community and node BOTS and

43
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:08,569
all these type of things it's the

44
00:02:08,569 --> 00:02:10,310
community that led me into exploring

45
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:13,370
those options it's the people there that

46
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:15,349
keep me there and make me want to work

47
00:02:15,349 --> 00:02:16,849
more and maybe going to work on open

48
00:02:16,849 --> 00:02:19,400
source and contribute back

49
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:24,829
and I just really love it and now who

50
00:02:24,829 --> 00:02:27,530
else should care it's a pretty easy

51
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:30,620
question everybody I know crazy right

52
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:35,180
it's really wild but it's something that

53
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:37,069
we should all care about because it

54
00:02:37,069 --> 00:02:39,859
impacts all of us you all are here today

55
00:02:39,859 --> 00:02:41,329
because you care about something you

56
00:02:41,329 --> 00:02:43,670
care about learning you care about

57
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:45,799
talking and meeting with other people in

58
00:02:45,799 --> 00:02:49,400
the community or you care about candy or

59
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:53,560
shirts that you get at the at the front

60
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:56,180
so it's called the other side of empathy

61
00:02:56,180 --> 00:03:00,560
but what is empathy we may have heard it

62
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,150
as like seeing the world through the

63
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:04,040
eyes of someone else taking the walk in

64
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:07,040
someone else's shoes and it's very

65
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,930
general it doesn't give a lot of apt

66
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:11,389
description but I like to think of it as

67
00:03:11,389 --> 00:03:15,049
the ability to understand and share the

68
00:03:15,049 --> 00:03:17,659
feelings of another that's not

69
00:03:17,659 --> 00:03:19,579
necessarily all feelings and emotion but

70
00:03:19,579 --> 00:03:21,170
feeling it able to understand and

71
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:24,109
connect with them is really true empathy

72
00:03:24,109 --> 00:03:28,010
as I see it so where did the other side

73
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:33,590
of empathy come from so as anyone who

74
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:36,220
uses Twitter there tends to be some

75
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:38,019
negative thoughts that come out

76
00:03:38,019 --> 00:03:40,069
something comes something new comes out

77
00:03:40,069 --> 00:03:42,290
like maybe the Instagram icon that got

78
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:44,060
released yesterday and there are many

79
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:45,650
snap judgments that people come up with

80
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:47,540
their people who instantly have

81
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:48,739
something and they take to Twitter and

82
00:03:48,739 --> 00:03:50,419
it's like 140 characters firing off 10

83
00:03:50,419 --> 00:03:54,919
10 11 and then this mob mentality forms

84
00:03:54,919 --> 00:03:58,220
around it and it's just a layer of

85
00:03:58,220 --> 00:03:59,629
negativity that's hard to get through

86
00:03:59,629 --> 00:04:02,510
and it must say just really bums me out

87
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:04,849
and it's hard to see some of the

88
00:04:04,849 --> 00:04:06,109
positive sides of the internet when

89
00:04:06,109 --> 00:04:08,299
stuff like that happens and I wanted to

90
00:04:08,299 --> 00:04:10,400
be able to see and connect with those

91
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,769
people and be like but if you knew the

92
00:04:12,769 --> 00:04:14,720
person who worked on that would you say

93
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,970
to their face which you able to connect

94
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:19,789
with them that way and if you knew could

95
00:04:19,789 --> 00:04:21,139
empathize with them would you say the

96
00:04:21,139 --> 00:04:22,760
same thing and we've heard from Rachel

97
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:26,479
about how she was so fearful of

98
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:28,789
contributing and becoming part of the

99
00:04:28,789 --> 00:04:30,320
open source community because of those

100
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,820
negative things that happen it's not

101
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:33,020
just Twitter

102
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:35,120
and in a lot of open communities so how

103
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,370
can resolve that how can we add empathy

104
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:39,470
and encourage it from our perspective

105
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:41,690
and get and receive it as well so the

106
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:43,490
other side is encouraging it as well as

107
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:46,879
be able to receive it back so it breaks

108
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:50,389
down into kind of four tenants I like to

109
00:04:50,389 --> 00:04:53,720
say one of them is context constructive

110
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,900
feedback as rachel has mentioned before

111
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:58,460
communication is very important and last

112
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:00,740
of all caring and these are kind of what

113
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:02,990
I'll be going through in-depth and

114
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:07,190
describing kind of how these apply to my

115
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:10,780
everyday job and as well as how I

116
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:12,460
impacted by the open source community

117
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:14,389
and things I've learned from it as well

118
00:05:14,389 --> 00:05:16,849
so I gave you all that but that

119
00:05:16,849 --> 00:05:18,860
background knowledge that's basically a

120
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:23,630
context so another description that

121
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:25,969
internal external factors that influence

122
00:05:25,969 --> 00:05:27,949
the decisions we make any actions we

123
00:05:27,949 --> 00:05:31,310
take internally could be subconscious it

124
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:33,830
could be something or could be external

125
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:35,780
factors by the way people we've learned

126
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:39,289
from others so it relates into this

127
00:05:39,289 --> 00:05:43,759
other side theory in that no one is

128
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:46,759
unoffending dated we have something that

129
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:48,110
we we have some kind of bias that we

130
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:49,340
have we may not recognize it right away

131
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:51,409
but it's there we've heard of onion

132
00:05:51,409 --> 00:05:52,669
pending native frameworks but the fact

133
00:05:52,669 --> 00:05:55,279
that it's not a framework but a library

134
00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:57,319
or a bunch of modules is an opinion

135
00:05:57,319 --> 00:05:58,400
about how they want to structure their

136
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:02,659
project we all have biases like I said

137
00:06:02,659 --> 00:06:05,389
it may recognize it or not an important

138
00:06:05,389 --> 00:06:07,819
part of contexts listening if someone's

139
00:06:07,819 --> 00:06:09,469
trying to give you some from information

140
00:06:09,469 --> 00:06:10,880
and you're not listening or we're not

141
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,819
listening back then it just kind of

142
00:06:13,819 --> 00:06:15,830
negates the whole part of empathizing

143
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:19,719
with them and of course asking why and

144
00:06:19,719 --> 00:06:23,479
asking why in a good way in an

145
00:06:23,479 --> 00:06:25,849
intentional way and wanting to learn

146
00:06:25,849 --> 00:06:27,650
from it and just continue asking why

147
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:30,169
until we find out and can connect with

148
00:06:30,169 --> 00:06:32,509
them and not why in a condescending way

149
00:06:32,509 --> 00:06:34,550
like rachel has heard from before and

150
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:38,659
kind of feigning ignorance and we can do

151
00:06:38,659 --> 00:06:39,819
this a bit more and set the example

152
00:06:39,819 --> 00:06:42,589
around giving context and receiving it's

153
00:06:42,589 --> 00:06:45,110
a great way that I've done it at work

154
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:46,670
and in have been courage to do it

155
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:48,740
or in open source projects is code

156
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:51,260
comments coke comments are really easy

157
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:54,620
way for people to read through a snippet

158
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:57,080
of code and understand what the author

159
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:00,680
was thinking about during that time it's

160
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:03,410
the ability for someone to jump into the

161
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:04,940
authors Bryan say what the heck were

162
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:06,920
they thinking or that teklet was I

163
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,830
thinking while writing this bit of code

164
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:12,730
and as especially in hardware I've

165
00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:15,200
become more aware of how important this

166
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,600
is so this is something actually

167
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:21,620
straight out of the tehsil CLI it's

168
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:24,920
dealing with node chip which is binary

169
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:27,590
modules doesn't really matter but seeing

170
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:30,230
that but python is inside this no script

171
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:32,510
might help clear up why the heck this is

172
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:35,120
here it without all this kind of story

173
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,610
and train of thought that we could

174
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:39,770
follow along with we wouldn't really be

175
00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:40,670
able to follow that if we had to

176
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:42,830
continue with it later or if someone

177
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:43,940
else is trying to jump to the project

178
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:46,310
contribute and salt just a bunch of

179
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:47,870
nonsense they're like why is this here

180
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:51,620
I'll just remove it and then we can just

181
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:55,520
remember what's going on again and so

182
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:59,060
remembering contexts for me comes in

183
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:01,940
kind of four steps I generally take a

184
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:06,050
deep breath and then I try to push aside

185
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:08,060
some snap judgments that come up I'm

186
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:10,270
very clear on recognizing what comes up

187
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:12,290
acknowledging those biases and trying to

188
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:14,120
see where they come from but making sure

189
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,260
that's not the first thing that comes

190
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:19,490
out of my mouth sincerely asking why why

191
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:22,550
did they choose to do this thing where

192
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:26,510
did this context come from and then

193
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:29,270
listening really really listening and

194
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:31,670
trying to pull in and parse what they're

195
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:32,990
saying and then asking why if you don't

196
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:34,729
understand again don't make assumptions

197
00:08:34,729 --> 00:08:38,720
and sincerely try to connect with them

198
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:42,650
and once we get that context and once we

199
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:44,540
give our context as well we might start

200
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:48,910
asking for constructive feedback and

201
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:51,950
understanding and getting to get

202
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:55,550
responded with embeth empathy so

203
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:57,650
constructive feedback very simply put is

204
00:08:57,650 --> 00:08:59,510
the return of information that helps to

205
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:00,100
do

206
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:03,279
or improve anything it can be a blog

207
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:07,240
post code design and it's that

208
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:10,019
constructive part of it that is key

209
00:09:10,019 --> 00:09:12,579
there's negative feedback startup

210
00:09:12,579 --> 00:09:14,350
criticism isn't great either and we just

211
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:17,319
want or even positive feedback and I'll

212
00:09:17,319 --> 00:09:21,699
go into that as well so we may have

213
00:09:21,699 --> 00:09:24,009
heard when we were younger at least when

214
00:09:24,009 --> 00:09:26,079
I went to school it was a lot of if you

215
00:09:26,079 --> 00:09:27,490
don't have anything nice to say then

216
00:09:27,490 --> 00:09:30,220
don't say it at all kind of the golden

217
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:32,860
rule or do unto you what you would have

218
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:35,759
done or something like that and

219
00:09:35,759 --> 00:09:38,410
somewhere between great school or

220
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:40,360
primary school were taught that we tend

221
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:43,060
to kind of lose it we don't remember

222
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:45,130
where it came from or even as we come

223
00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:46,839
adults why we should keep remembering

224
00:09:46,839 --> 00:09:49,660
this and for this talk I specifically

225
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:52,000
want to talk about this constructive

226
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,199
part of it so when giving feedback just

227
00:09:56,199 --> 00:09:58,089
saying that looks great that's that's

228
00:09:58,089 --> 00:10:00,130
that rocks is and we're at when we're

229
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:01,360
genuinely asking for constructive

230
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,279
feedback that doesn't really help yes

231
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:05,589
and so we're going to want to ask for

232
00:10:05,589 --> 00:10:06,970
another thing to constructive to say

233
00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:08,800
don't say anything at all we may have

234
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,560
seen like github comments the +1 it's

235
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:14,380
great to get that feedback but it's just

236
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:16,630
going to annoy cause noise for that fee

237
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:18,490
that issue we want to get genuine

238
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:20,410
constructive feedback and help people

239
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:24,670
using it or make it help it improve

240
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:27,639
later on and then some people kind of

241
00:10:27,639 --> 00:10:28,720
have brought up before what about

242
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:33,430
negative feedback and as I've talked to

243
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:35,110
some people on Twitter before again back

244
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:38,949
with Twitter a negative feedback can

245
00:10:38,949 --> 00:10:42,310
might make change but good feedback

246
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:45,399
takes more than 140 characters as Rachel

247
00:10:45,399 --> 00:10:47,139
maver reference before getting feedback

248
00:10:47,139 --> 00:10:49,360
and trying to get help on Twitter it's

249
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,089
really hard you lose context people jump

250
00:10:52,089 --> 00:10:54,250
in to random bits of the conversation

251
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:55,959
not seeing what was happening before and

252
00:10:55,959 --> 00:10:57,490
not just getting enough information to

253
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:02,350
give a really helpful comments yeah the

254
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:03,730
whole hundred forty characters problem

255
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:05,139
maybe we shouldn't use Twitter for that

256
00:11:05,139 --> 00:11:07,329
type of stuff sometimes it could be

257
00:11:07,329 --> 00:11:10,209
better ways and so constructive feedback

258
00:11:10,209 --> 00:11:13,690
is mutual mutually agreed upon like

259
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:16,480
for like Rachel reference before is like

260
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,340
random people coming in for someone's

261
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:20,950
first contribution when it's generally

262
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:22,660
not asked for yet if they release it and

263
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:25,000
people jump in without being knowledge

264
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,230
that they're being asked for

265
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:28,330
constructive feedback it becomes off as

266
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:30,220
defensive for the people receiving it

267
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:33,430
and it set up with expectations okay i'm

268
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:35,110
getting code review I which I'll

269
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:38,560
reference soon and the expectation is

270
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,000
that I want you to focus on this part of

271
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,920
the code not this part I recognize that

272
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:44,080
it's not great but it's going to be

273
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,280
distracting if we start focusing on it

274
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:48,880
now it's in an open space and by open

275
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,050
space I don't necessarily mean like a

276
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:52,690
big room I mean in a way that people can

277
00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:54,820
pull back from that feedback if it's too

278
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:57,280
much for them if it's anxiety driven if

279
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:00,940
it becomes just too stressful that they

280
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:03,610
can pull away whenever they want to it's

281
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:05,140
not someone coming up to their chair and

282
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:06,970
in saying have some thoughts about this

283
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:08,410
and they're just like I can't do this

284
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:11,080
right now there's none and it's also

285
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,450
shared with context we need context

286
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:15,160
behind why they think this is good

287
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:18,610
feedback so yeah code brews are a really

288
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:20,980
easy example at work and in an open

289
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:23,830
source and there tend to defined in fix

290
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:26,050
mistakes that are overlooked proving and

291
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:27,130
overall quality of software and

292
00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:29,230
developer skills overall quality can be

293
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:32,050
kind of subjective but the fact that

294
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:33,400
they wouldn't improve it is the big

295
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,720
thing it's not commenting on spelling

296
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,950
mistakes if that's not what's being

297
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:37,980
focused on for a constructive feedback

298
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:41,230
and we can encourage it to especially

299
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:42,940
with an open source there's some great

300
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:44,500
little things that github is provided

301
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:48,100
and other platforms as well contributing

302
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,620
md files whenever some ties to open up

303
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:51,970
or request or create an issue we have

304
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:53,890
these guidelines for you to view and not

305
00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:55,810
everyone may click on that but they're

306
00:12:55,810 --> 00:12:58,780
available for people to view so my

307
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:01,330
favorites are the atom projects has some

308
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:03,940
great guidelines and with emoji and

309
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:06,130
great descriptions as well as the hoodie

310
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:07,900
project I'm a little biased but it's

311
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:10,510
really really perfect they go into all

312
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:11,890
sorts of things about how the project is

313
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:13,600
managed and how they can help out in any

314
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,690
way with writing issues and even code

315
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:19,750
and then recently issue templates

316
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:21,610
started popping up for github

317
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:23,350
repositories as well as get lab has had

318
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:25,210
them for a while and it's great for

319
00:13:25,210 --> 00:13:27,640
setting up okay I need this

320
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,130
back from you I need this context in

321
00:13:30,130 --> 00:13:34,420
order to really help out and so you can

322
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:35,800
give me proper feedback on something

323
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,360
that's bugging you or something that you

324
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,530
want to help fix and all of this type of

325
00:13:40,530 --> 00:13:42,790
context and constructive feedback comes

326
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:46,600
through proper communication basically

327
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,370
the successful sharing of ideas and

328
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:52,840
feelings between people and ultimately

329
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,160
communication is how we interact with

330
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,990
each other we communicate by talking in

331
00:13:55,990 --> 00:13:58,540
the hallways communicate online there

332
00:13:58,540 --> 00:13:59,770
are so many people who I've communicated

333
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:01,960
solely online and then just got to meet

334
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:04,180
at conferences and having that solid

335
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:06,460
communication beforehand helped me feel

336
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:09,450
more comfortable meeting them in person

337
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:13,990
so it relates in what we sing how we say

338
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:18,670
it and where we say it as well in how we

339
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:22,750
say things I statements are very very

340
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:24,480
nice for giving constructive feedback

341
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:28,480
saying I saw this thing that will help

342
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:31,810
improve this code I believe it's not

343
00:14:31,810 --> 00:14:35,320
good for getting context saying that i

344
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:39,100
know this is better just because it's

345
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:42,130
not great for that use statements are

346
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:44,350
great for getting context why did you

347
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:46,120
make this decision why did you choose

348
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:49,900
this library why did you choose to have

349
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:53,470
this arbitrary number of timeouts but

350
00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:55,060
it's not great for giving constructive

351
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:59,290
feedback you should fix this you have

352
00:14:59,290 --> 00:15:05,170
done this wrong that's not great and for

353
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:06,730
communication we have different so many

354
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:07,900
different mediums communicate through

355
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:10,300
now at work we communicate through so

356
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:11,740
many different options and they all have

357
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:13,750
their own purpose slack is a great

358
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:17,020
general super quick chats especially for

359
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:18,520
remote employees or even people around

360
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:20,650
the office for just quick feedback with

361
00:15:20,650 --> 00:15:24,310
a group stand-ups are great for giving

362
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:27,910
more in person one to one context and

363
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:29,980
then recorded scuss ins that comes with

364
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:30,940
github issues that can be referenced

365
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:33,940
later and enforce long form or a sync

366
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:35,860
email is the perfect option we don't

367
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:37,690
always need an answer right away email

368
00:15:37,690 --> 00:15:39,690
is great to give people time and

369
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:41,320
measured

370
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:44,230
back and discussions mailing list might

371
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:45,550
be another thing but we'll go into that

372
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:49,270
the note option and we can create

373
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:51,790
communication I have one point here I

374
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:56,410
want to touch on the word sucks is kind

375
00:15:56,410 --> 00:15:59,760
of a trigger word for me because it

376
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:02,980
provides no context it provides no

377
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:05,560
constructive feedback and just kind of

378
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:07,810
it's dead in the water as far as

379
00:16:07,810 --> 00:16:10,270
continuing and creating empathy whenever

380
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:11,830
here someone says something sucks on

381
00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:15,310
Twitter or in just general comments it

382
00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:16,810
doesn't help me it doesn't help the

383
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:19,660
person who's getting feedback and unless

384
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:22,170
you're talking about like DJ Roomba

385
00:16:22,170 --> 00:16:24,610
sucks or some kind of other vacuum sucks

386
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:29,170
has really no beneficial and sometimes

387
00:16:29,170 --> 00:16:31,630
yes something sucks but we can be more

388
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:33,930
descriptive to help out other people

389
00:16:33,930 --> 00:16:36,490
that said before there are many other

390
00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:37,810
mediums to chat with people especially

391
00:16:37,810 --> 00:16:42,430
online and giving more wide more

392
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:44,230
characters than 140 to chat with other

393
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:47,650
people their slack getter IRC that still

394
00:16:47,650 --> 00:16:49,510
exists I know slacks very popular I RC

395
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:51,490
still exist as well and of course github

396
00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:56,080
and slack I really like because of the

397
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:59,770
customization options so in the hoodie

398
00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:01,390
slack and some other slacks I've added

399
00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:04,930
this little line in the slack bot to say

400
00:17:04,930 --> 00:17:07,089
when someone said something sucks could

401
00:17:07,089 --> 00:17:08,680
you be more descriptive I don't

402
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:10,060
understand could you empathize on that

403
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:12,880
or just different options to try to pull

404
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:15,100
more information from them so that I can

405
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:16,780
understand and others can understand

406
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:18,370
what they're going through and how we

407
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:22,209
can help fix it and ultimately all these

408
00:17:22,209 --> 00:17:26,230
options they require caring it's

409
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:28,570
providing the need of something and

410
00:17:28,570 --> 00:17:30,730
showing interest in it genuine interest

411
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:35,830
in it it's caring is sharing it's

412
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:38,650
listening and ultimately as I said in

413
00:17:38,650 --> 00:17:39,910
the beginning it's understanding and

414
00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:43,210
connecting with people and we can show

415
00:17:43,210 --> 00:17:45,730
how much we care as contributors and

416
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:47,650
maintain errs and even people trying to

417
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:50,080
use and as part of the community around

418
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:54,390
a project or a library or a person

419
00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:56,190
you care enough to write a blog post to

420
00:17:56,190 --> 00:17:58,380
kind of go through your steps that gives

421
00:17:58,380 --> 00:17:59,790
so much context if we can read a

422
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:02,370
long-form answer of that you can't have

423
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:03,870
to file an issue if you have a getup

424
00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:05,280
account and you're able to file an issue

425
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,740
or even sending email as an issue to

426
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:10,020
someone do you have that time can you

427
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:12,570
you send the email do you have enough

428
00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:14,640
time to record a screencast that really

429
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,890
helps give a lot of contacts with kind

430
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:18,900
of arbitrary details that someone might

431
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:21,480
not add through text I mean pictures

432
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,100
worth a thousand words a screencast will

433
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:26,010
give you a million and you even have

434
00:18:26,010 --> 00:18:28,980
enough time and availability and care to

435
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:30,690
submit a pull request I know not

436
00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:32,130
everyone has the technical knowledge or

437
00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:34,260
even the time or even the privilege to

438
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:36,780
go and contribute to that but if you

439
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:39,150
have the time and the ability and

440
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:40,860
someone else is working on something

441
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:43,650
else overall or just does not have the

442
00:18:43,650 --> 00:18:46,110
bandwidth to do that can you can you

443
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:47,670
actually start helping at least and then

444
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:50,090
they can help finish you along the way

445
00:18:50,090 --> 00:18:53,190
and of course don't give in to hate it

446
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:56,130
leads to the dark side we shouldn't hate

447
00:18:56,130 --> 00:18:59,820
on things in the sense that we care so

448
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:01,410
much about it that we hate that it's not

449
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:05,670
getting done it's more about what can we

450
00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:09,050
do to help in any way possible

451
00:19:09,050 --> 00:19:11,970
documentation is super important as

452
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:12,810
we've been learning more and more

453
00:19:12,810 --> 00:19:15,060
throughout working on open source and

454
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:18,510
even internally in companies wikis code

455
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:21,810
comments style guides pattern libraries

456
00:19:21,810 --> 00:19:24,030
even a readme a simple reading can go so

457
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:26,550
far to helping encourage contributions

458
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:28,860
or empathy empathizing with the creator

459
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:33,390
of a project and we can exemplify

460
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:36,900
carrying in so many different ways I'm

461
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:38,100
going to embarrass her right now but

462
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:39,630
it's one of my favorite things that's

463
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:42,750
kind of recently has been Susan's AVR

464
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:46,710
girl test pilot it's an example of going

465
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:48,390
above and beyond caring about

466
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:50,690
contributors and a community for project

467
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:53,460
it's an app that she bundled with the

468
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:57,600
CLI for AVR girl Arduino and it helps

469
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,810
people want to contribute to

470
00:19:59,810 --> 00:20:01,680
automatically run through her hardware

471
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,210
test suite with whatever board they have

472
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:05,310
on them fast with Arduino and there's so

473
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:07,800
many out there that this

474
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:10,400
her not buy everything and helps her

475
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,510
contribute logs about maybe something

476
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:14,790
went wrong and in their environment that

477
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:16,790
she can get a lot of context from that

478
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:22,020
and because they're opting into sharing

479
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:24,240
what they want they have the option to

480
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,100
be added as a contributor to the project

481
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:28,260
which is just great it helps that green

482
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:29,790
graph even though it doesn't mean that

483
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:31,080
much and shouldn't care too much about

484
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:32,850
it some people do and they want to see

485
00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:34,710
that on their timeline and see that oh I

486
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:37,140
helped out this project so Sue's has

487
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:39,060
made that a great part of encouraging

488
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:42,650
and caring more about the project and

489
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:46,800
this is great reasons why to create

490
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,120
something like this manual testing is

491
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:51,060
boring and she recognizes that you don't

492
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:52,440
get the little green square and most

493
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:54,090
people have Hardware know a lot of start

494
00:20:54,090 --> 00:20:55,530
there's lot of assumptions with the

495
00:20:55,530 --> 00:20:57,840
hardware background where oh I know you

496
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,580
know this so just run it and you're fine

497
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:02,010
or set this up set up a compiler and

498
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:04,290
you're good to go but not everyone has

499
00:21:04,290 --> 00:21:05,700
that time even for getting started with

500
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:08,640
hardware and sometimes there's too many

501
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,800
steps involved like I said before who

502
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,810
knows how to cross compile something off

503
00:21:12,810 --> 00:21:14,520
the top of their head or once to even

504
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:17,880
spend hours googling for that and then

505
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:20,070
within open source I've been work I've

506
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:22,890
gotten a lot of mentors mentoring really

507
00:21:22,890 --> 00:21:24,690
matters do you remember starting out and

508
00:21:24,690 --> 00:21:27,360
not knowing any where you're going do

509
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:30,030
you even have a mentor did you want one

510
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:33,180
if so why not if you did then what

511
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:35,370
happened and do you want to learn

512
00:21:35,370 --> 00:21:37,830
mentoring and training teaching will

513
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:39,540
force you to learn so much about a

514
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:42,210
subject that you're able to give it back

515
00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:45,480
in a more cohesive and approachable way

516
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:49,410
and kind of a word of warning about how

517
00:21:49,410 --> 00:21:51,720
much we care and being aware of what we

518
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:55,110
actually care about I ran into an issue

519
00:21:55,110 --> 00:21:57,600
with this recently for myself at work

520
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,610
and I was starting to care more about a

521
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:03,000
project in the code involved because I

522
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,950
was working on it so hard and I thought

523
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:08,010
it would solve a lot of solutions and I

524
00:22:08,010 --> 00:22:11,010
began to ignore something the things

525
00:22:11,010 --> 00:22:13,560
like I cared most about but had just

526
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:15,900
completely pushed him to the wayside I

527
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:19,170
was my communication was opaque I didn't

528
00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:21,370
give proper communication or a proper

529
00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:22,990
feedback or pay attention to it as well

530
00:22:22,990 --> 00:22:24,550
from when that was getting feedback from

531
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:27,309
others and I was putting so much work

532
00:22:27,309 --> 00:22:30,430
and care into just the project I forgot

533
00:22:30,430 --> 00:22:32,050
about the people and the people I had to

534
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:36,490
work with we it was very embarrassing

535
00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:38,200
for me because I became the hypocrite of

536
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:42,610
my own message and it code can be easily

537
00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:45,550
tossed aside and built again but

538
00:22:45,550 --> 00:22:46,809
relationship with people either

539
00:22:46,809 --> 00:22:48,940
professionally or personally take more

540
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:50,860
time to mend and will be proved useful

541
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:52,960
than any line of code I'll ever writes

542
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:56,410
if anyone's ever read the ten

543
00:22:56,410 --> 00:22:57,910
commandments of the ego lyst programmer

544
00:22:57,910 --> 00:22:59,770
it applies to so many different things

545
00:22:59,770 --> 00:23:02,200
and that helped me recognize what I was

546
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:04,240
actually focused on and how wrong I was

547
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:07,090
and be able to recognize and care enough

548
00:23:07,090 --> 00:23:09,700
to push aside your own ego and try to

549
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:11,260
connect with others even if it means

550
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:13,120
pushing aside a project they've worked

551
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,880
so hard on can be difficult but

552
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:19,540
enormously helpful and contributing back

553
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:22,150
with empathy and anything we do it could

554
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:23,890
be just listening for a day just take a

555
00:23:23,890 --> 00:23:25,630
moment and listen to what people are

556
00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:27,850
saying and understand with them apply

557
00:23:27,850 --> 00:23:30,429
the examples that I've gone over we can

558
00:23:30,429 --> 00:23:31,870
start off small too it doesn't have to

559
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:33,220
be everything at once you can just start

560
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:35,559
maybe just trying to put a readme in one

561
00:23:35,559 --> 00:23:38,140
of your project repos or just starting

562
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:39,520
to influence and ask for more code

563
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,490
comments or just asking for feedback

564
00:23:41,490 --> 00:23:45,490
sincerely remaining open to sharing what

565
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:47,410
others are saying or what you're sharing

566
00:23:47,410 --> 00:23:49,090
as well and be able to communicate with

567
00:23:49,090 --> 00:23:51,460
that with others and some people might

568
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:53,650
view this and say that still sounds like

569
00:23:53,650 --> 00:23:56,920
a lot of work I'm sorry it's just got to

570
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:58,000
deal with it it's something that's

571
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,100
really going to matter and it's

572
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:01,150
something that's going to benefit

573
00:24:01,150 --> 00:24:06,040
everyone because by applying empathy to

574
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:08,470
what we do we can connect with other

575
00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:10,450
professionally and then begin to

576
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:14,110
reconnect with others personally some of

577
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:15,910
my resources so my favorite resource to

578
00:24:15,910 --> 00:24:18,700
get started especially with the type of

579
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:21,520
empathy I'm speaking about practical

580
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,200
empathy is a great book to start out

581
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,950
with nonviolent communication is really

582
00:24:26,950 --> 00:24:29,140
helpful for recognizing those i use

583
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:31,000
statements and realizing more about how

584
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,280
we communicate with people creativity

585
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:35,020
inc if you have noticed i really

586
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:37,060
Pixar and Disney it's a great way to see

587
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:39,190
how people work together creatively and

588
00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:42,220
learn more from each other but I also

589
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:43,600
gather a bunch of resources that aren't

590
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:48,220
just books at this website I love the

591
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:50,770
URL and I was fortunate to find it more

592
00:24:50,770 --> 00:24:56,170
empathy online and I've started it back

593
00:24:56,170 --> 00:24:59,050
when I went to jas confi you back some

594
00:24:59,050 --> 00:25:01,180
September but I've fallen to the wayside

595
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:02,710
unfortunate because of other projects

596
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:06,250
but I would love your help it is open

597
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:09,460
source and it's under my repo hipster

598
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:11,890
brown the other side of empathy and i

599
00:25:11,890 --> 00:25:13,450
created a readme because i realized last

600
00:25:13,450 --> 00:25:15,460
night i did have a readme for it and so

601
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:17,140
I was like oh I gotta get this up and

602
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:20,080
get it going and your help would be

603
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:22,540
enormously helpful like if you saw

604
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:24,070
something that helped you understand

605
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:25,900
someone else it could be a blog post a

606
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:29,050
book a video a podcast even I love

607
00:25:29,050 --> 00:25:30,580
podcast I learned so much from hearing

608
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:33,640
people talk and listening because

609
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:36,490
there's no visual distraction and it

610
00:25:36,490 --> 00:25:38,680
really helps and I have some hopefully

611
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:40,390
very helpful instruction of how to

612
00:25:40,390 --> 00:25:42,370
contribute either on the web or even

613
00:25:42,370 --> 00:25:43,780
through the command line but I know not

614
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:46,390
everyone is as adept with get on the

615
00:25:46,390 --> 00:25:51,010
command line or even locally so that's

616
00:25:51,010 --> 00:25:54,160
basically it I want you to go out look

617
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:56,320
for empathy try to understand it and

618
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,360

619
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:00,250
to this list for other people to learn

620
