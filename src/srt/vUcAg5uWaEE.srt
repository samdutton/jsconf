1

reject I can everyone hear me okay at

2
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:20,970
the back it's fine yeah okay cool I will

3
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:22,769
just start by saying thank you very much

4
00:00:22,769 --> 00:00:24,779
for having me to speak it's an

5
00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:26,490
incredible honor and a pleasure to be

6
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:29,720
here and to be part of this great

7
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:33,570
JavaScript community maybe I'll start

8
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:35,340
and introduce myself a little bit my

9
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:39,360
name is Melanie I'm lead web developer

10
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,160
and co-founder of little web giants

11
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:43,079
we're a small digital agency we do

12
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:47,730
websites and online marketing I am

13
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:50,129
actually pretty much a self-taught

14
00:00:50,129 --> 00:00:52,430
developer my background is in

15
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:55,140
environmental activism and social

16
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:58,500
justice work so I'm not really here to

17
00:00:58,500 --> 00:00:59,789
talk to you about any kind of like

18
00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:03,260
amazing higher-level cutting-edge

19
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:06,990
brand-new acma script stuff I'm kind of

20
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:09,360
reporting back from the trenches of some

21
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,070
practical stuff that I've experienced in

22
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:12,990
my work and wanted to kind of share with

23
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:21,200
you guys today in our work we do sorry

24
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,759
we do a lot of work with not-for-profit

25
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:25,439
organizations and the renewable energy

26
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:29,340
industry and as part of this we're

27
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:30,810
working a lot with organizations that

28
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:33,180
are receiving government funding and

29
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:35,430
this kind of plays into why I became

30
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:37,200
really interested in this topic of

31
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,409
accessibility because will first start

32
00:01:40,409 --> 00:01:42,060
often if you're receiving government

33
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:44,399
funding there is some compulsion that

34
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:46,890
you should meet a minimum accessibility

35
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:49,229
requirements in the web products that

36
00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:52,079
you develop and I think also it's it's

37
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:55,049
for me a really burning an important

38
00:01:55,049 --> 00:01:57,270
issue because I think access to the

39
00:01:57,270 --> 00:01:58,770
internet and access to all the

40
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:01,049
information and tools and communities

41
00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:03,450
that are available online is an

42
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:05,280
incredibly transformative and powerful

43
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,530
thing in people's lives and at a time

44
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:08,940
when we're seeing the Internet is kind

45
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:11,009
of becoming more closed and more

46
00:02:11,009 --> 00:02:13,140
proprietary software and kind of closing

47
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:13,700
off into these

48
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:16,150
war gardens ensuring that everyone

49
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:19,510
everywhere has access to free and open

50
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:22,310
education and free and open Internet I

51
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:24,290
think is really one of the most

52
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:25,910
important social justice issues of our

53
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:28,730
times so today I'm just going to show

54
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:30,410
you some kind of little tips and tricks

55
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:34,010
that you can use to hopefully not so

56
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:36,200
much effort to implement but can

57
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,060
actually really radically transform how

58
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:41,150
accessible your web projects are to a

59
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:46,510
wide range of people okay so starting

60
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:49,400
from what do we mean by accessibility

61
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:52,400
when we hear this word we often tend to

62
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,650
think of it in terms of our we need to

63
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:56,900
cater for people who have specific

64
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:59,060
disabilities we can kind of broadly

65
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:00,890
break this down into people with some

66
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:02,739
sort of visual impairment or the blind

67
00:03:02,739 --> 00:03:06,470
auditory unable to hear a cognitive

68
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:08,060
issue so this might be either an

69
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:10,010
intellectual disability or a learning

70
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:13,069
disability or people who just their

71
00:03:13,069 --> 00:03:14,690
first language is not the language of

72
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:18,950
the website in question and then finally

73
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:20,900
we have motor disabilities so this is

74
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:23,540
relating to how well or how not well

75
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:25,790
you're able to to move which of course

76
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:27,200
then relates to how well you're able to

77
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:31,850
control a mouse and a keyboard so we

78
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:33,410
tend to kind of think of these groups as

79
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:36,200
being served by specific assistive

80
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:39,620
technologies so if you have visual

81
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:41,359
impairment then some of the tools you

82
00:03:41,359 --> 00:03:44,000
might use include screen readers so on

83
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,769
Mac there's the voiceover for windows

84
00:03:45,769 --> 00:03:48,739
there's this software called jaws other

85
00:03:48,739 --> 00:03:50,900
approaches we can take as designers and

86
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:52,639
developers is to ensure our designs are

87
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:54,500
very legible you know not kind of too

88
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:57,650
cluttered and things like this if

89
00:03:57,650 --> 00:04:00,319
there's auditory impairment then we can

90
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:03,590
kind of serve people who have this

91
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:06,200
problem through the use of subtitles or

92
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,510
the use of alternative text for audio or

93
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:13,910
video content for people who have some

94
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:15,889
sort of cognitive impairment then it can

95
00:04:15,889 --> 00:04:18,340
be really really useful to a supply

96
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:21,039
alternative content in the form of

97
00:04:21,039 --> 00:04:24,020
simpler text it's easier to understand

98
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:26,960
and maybe supplemented with images as

99
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:27,290
well

100
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:30,050
in Germany there's like this kind of

101
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:32,540
concept is actually formally legislated

102
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:34,970
and it's known as lactis rocker so

103
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:37,760
that's easy speech and you can actually

104
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:40,070
hire someone who will do translation

105
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:42,230
from kind of normal German to this

106
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:46,370
lightish barca for you and then finally

107
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:47,840
when we're looking at motor impairment

108
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,810
then we tend to think of how can we make

109
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:54,680
our websites navigable using the

110
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,960
keyboard so that people who maybe are

111
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,240
not able to control a mouse particularly

112
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:02,270
well have an alternative way to access

113
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:05,240
the information on a website so this is

114
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,340
quite a sort of literal interpretation

115
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:08,900
of what accessibility means so we

116
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:11,180
identify a disability or a set of

117
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:13,040
disabilities and then we identify the

118
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:15,230
assistive technologies that we should

119
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:20,060
work to support but I do like to think

120
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:22,040
about accessibility as a little bit more

121
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:24,710
broad than that as I said earlier I

122
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:26,690
think it really comes down to a big

123
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:30,920
social justice issue and so it could be

124
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,780
more than just people that we would

125
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:34,910
consider as following under some kind of

126
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:38,210
banner of disabled so accessibility is

127
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:40,580
also thinking about how do we make our

128
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:42,920
work inclusive to people across a whole

129
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:46,010
range of age spectrums how do we reach

130
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:48,050
out to older people how do we make sure

131
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:50,030
that information is also accessible to

132
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:52,100
younger people people might have

133
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:53,800
different educational cultural

134
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,790
backgrounds so if you're seeking to

135
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:57,860
provide information maybe you need to

136
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:59,540
think about the sort of stories or

137
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:01,010
metaphors or parables that you're

138
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:03,740
telling that might not apply to certain

139
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:04,940
cultural groups that you're trying to

140
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:08,690
reach and depending on the purpose of

141
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:10,760
your project Internet bandwidth may also

142
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,590
be an accessibility issue you know if

143
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:14,660
you're trying to send like 20 megabytes

144
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:17,080
of really beautiful high-resolution

145
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:20,990
images down the line to someone in like

146
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:24,020
sub-saharan Africa you're not really

147
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:27,740
serving them at all so it really can

148
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:29,300
depend on the needs of your project but

149
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:31,100
I think thinking about accessibility is

150
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:33,110
really thinking in his broad terms as

151
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:35,750
possible how do we reach an audience

152
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:40,240
serve an audience and empower people

153
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:44,130
so I'm going to talk briefly about the

154
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:46,919
kind of legal frameworks that exists and

155
00:06:46,919 --> 00:06:49,800
some of the like w3c specifications that

156
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:52,680
exist that we should be trying to fall

157
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:55,440
in line with technically and then in the

158
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,550
final part of the talk I'll talk a

159
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:58,410
little bit more about how you can apply

160
00:06:58,410 --> 00:07:01,770
that in a more practical sense i'll try

161
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:03,210
and whip through this legislation stuff

162
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:06,360
because it's a bit boring okay so we

163
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:09,150
have the UN Convention of Human Rights

164
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:11,130
of Rights with persons with disabilities

165
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:14,759
sorry recognizes access to the web as a

166
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:17,280
right that should be respected a basic

167
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:22,020
human right so we I think have a really

168
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:25,740
strong ethical obligation as people who

169
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:27,330
are very empowered who are very savvy

170
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:29,729
users of technology to make sure that

171
00:07:29,729 --> 00:07:31,500
other people who might not have the same

172
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:34,080
access and the same rights and abilities

173
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:37,199
as us are able to to get that access as

174
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:39,780
well and there are legislative

175
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:42,180
frameworks to support this so I'm

176
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:43,860
familiar particularly with Germany the

177
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:45,930
UK and a little bit the US but there's

178
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:47,070
frameworks in other countries as well

179
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:49,530
this doesn't usually apply to the

180
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:51,539
private sector but it will apply to

181
00:07:51,539 --> 00:07:53,159
government organizations and too many

182
00:07:53,159 --> 00:07:54,630
nonprofit organizations that receive

183
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:56,159
government funding so it's kind of good

184
00:07:56,159 --> 00:08:00,080
to be aware of these basic frameworks

185
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,550
unfortunately it's quite hard to find

186
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:05,630
practical examples of how to take this

187
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:08,880
legislative framework and the rules and

188
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:12,320
the specs and turn it into something

189
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:14,789
practical that you can kind of just use

190
00:08:14,789 --> 00:08:17,820
in your everyday workflow and I kind of

191
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:19,650
think of this a little bit like maybe

192
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:21,930
four or five years ago and you had this

193
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:24,300
problem with like two floated divs and

194
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:26,099
then the next dave is coming up here and

195
00:08:26,099 --> 00:08:27,539
you're like what's going on and then

196
00:08:27,539 --> 00:08:29,880
you're like ah I need your clear fix get

197
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:32,070
down there div do what you're supposed

198
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:34,500
to be doing and and there was like this

199
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,000
kind of whole debate in the community

200
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,560
how do you achieve this really simple

201
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:39,300
layout of like to give thanks to each

202
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:42,599
other and one underneath and now we just

203
00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:44,850
have the CLE fix and if you're like me

204
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:46,500
you just like at include feet clear

205
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,570
fixin and you're done and that problem

206
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:51,540
is kind of being solved by the community

207
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:53,430
and there's a default kind of

208
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:57,660
a of just making that work which I don't

209
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:59,700
think really exists for a lot of this

210
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:01,320
stuff that we're talking about in terms

211
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,060
of how to make websites more accessible

212
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:04,260
so one of the things I'm trying to do

213
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:06,180
here today is to give you some kind of

214
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:07,440
practical stuff that you don't need to

215
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:12,420
think about too much to just apply okay

216
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:14,899
so then we come to standards and specs

217
00:09:14,899 --> 00:09:18,899
w3c of course big bad boss of the

218
00:09:18,899 --> 00:09:22,290
Internet's they have to kind of relevant

219
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:26,430
specs that we can use as guidelines for

220
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:28,380
what we should be doing in our web

221
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:32,850
projects the first one is I'm going to

222
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:35,610
say V CAG because I've lived in Germany

223
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:40,320
for five years I can do that so this is

224
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:44,279
kind of an older guidelines and this is

225
00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:46,830
a set of recommendations for how we can

226
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:48,720
go about making the web more accessible

227
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,839
and it breaks down sorry at a higher

228
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:54,180
level we can kind of say it's these four

229
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:57,360
ideas so everything on the web page or

230
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,640
website should be perceivable okay

231
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:02,370
that's fairly clear so you should be

232
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:04,170
able to read the text it shouldn't be

233
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:07,650
hidden to obscurely or if there's video

234
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:09,300
or audio there needs to be alternate

235
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:12,290
content that explains what it's about

236
00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:15,839
okay it should be operable yeah again

237
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:17,700
pretty straightforward we want people to

238
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,890
be able to navigate around our site so

239
00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:21,779
you know don't have things where you

240
00:10:21,779 --> 00:10:23,760
click and like the button runs away or

241
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:27,050
whatever you know pretty straightforward

242
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:28,830
understandable so this is about

243
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:30,870
providing user feedback and kind of

244
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:33,209
conforming to design patterns that allow

245
00:10:33,209 --> 00:10:35,640
people to more or less know what they're

246
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:38,279
doing and robust so this is about a

247
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:41,329
forward compatibility and complying with

248
00:10:41,329 --> 00:10:48,510
standards which we all do anyway so it's

249
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:50,010
divided into three priority levels and

250
00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:54,720
this WCAG guidelines basically forms the

251
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,149
the basis for most legislation that's in

252
00:10:57,149 --> 00:11:02,730
place I will talk about that a little

253
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:06,329
bit more so the problem with the WCAG is

254
00:11:06,329 --> 00:11:07,230
when you really

255
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:10,080
going to break down what's going on

256
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:13,790
there it really is a lot of very very

257
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:18,810
kind of cross every T dot every I alt

258
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:22,680
text every image title every link and it

259
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,060
can feel like it's this incredibly

260
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:26,550
nitpicky approach where you just have to

261
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:27,840
be focused on all these tiny little

262
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:30,570
details and then you just start to think

263
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:32,340
oh my god life I work with the content

264
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:33,780
management system or I work with a

265
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:36,900
Content team or I there is no way I'm

266
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:38,460
ever going to be able to make sure every

267
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:40,770
single image on my site has an alt text

268
00:11:40,770 --> 00:11:42,780
description I just it's too much it's

269
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:44,610
too hard I'm just going to give up and

270
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:47,490
walk away and unfortunately because this

271
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:49,520
is sort of underpinning the legislation

272
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:51,450
it's tended to be a little bit of a

273
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:54,510
turn-off for people so I think there's

274
00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:55,830
some other ways we can think about that

275
00:11:55,830 --> 00:11:59,700
which we'll talk about shortly as well

276
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:02,280
as the WCAG there's a new standard

277
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:05,760
called wa I aria and this is a

278
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,700
recognition that web pages aren't really

279
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:11,160
just the static documents that Tim

280
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:13,380
berners-lee envisaged you know 25 years

281
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:16,590
ago we have these really rich Internet

282
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:18,210
applications where things are being

283
00:12:18,210 --> 00:12:21,300
updated or filtered or loaded in all the

284
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:25,640
time and it's very difficult to alert a

285
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:28,230
technology like a screen reader that

286
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:30,510
something's just changed on the page so

287
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:32,640
if your vision is fine and you're

288
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:34,260
looking you can easily see well like

289
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:35,670
something just loaded in there there's

290
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:38,580
been an update or whatever but if your

291
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:39,990
vision impaired and you're reliant on a

292
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:41,640
screen reader to basically read through

293
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:45,060
the page for you the web page needs some

294
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:46,680
way of saying well well well screen

295
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,120
reader come back up to the top of the

296
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:52,080
page there's like important news so WA

297
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:54,930
aria is the kind of a new specification

298
00:12:54,930 --> 00:12:58,280
or relatively new that's trying to

299
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:01,140
reflect that and allow way basically for

300
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:04,080
us as developers to communicate or the

301
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,730
browser to communicate to assistive

302
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:07,020
technologies that something has changed

303
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:11,920
on the page

304
00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:15,320
won't talk about too much I will skip

305
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,000
through the German legislation because

306
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,290
it's quite boring but I will talk a

307
00:13:21,290 --> 00:13:22,460
little bit about the UK legislation

308
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:24,440
because i think the UK has taken a

309
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,730
slightly different approach which i

310
00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:29,959
think is really really fantastic so the

311
00:13:29,959 --> 00:13:32,300
there is one set of legislation which is

312
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:34,399
really based on this WCAG standard and

313
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:36,080
that's really like make sure your alt

314
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:38,720
text is there like make sure your links

315
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:42,470
have titles you know really black text

316
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:46,040
on a white screen thank you but they

317
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:47,420
also have this other document called the

318
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:49,670
pas 78 and if you're working on a

319
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:51,290
project where accessibility is an

320
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:52,670
important issue I cannot recommend

321
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:56,110
enough that you check this document out

322
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:58,790
that's it's it's quite short it's like

323
00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:01,040
20 pages long it's non-technical it's

324
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,390
intended for a non technical audience

325
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:04,430
and the idea is how do you go about

326
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:07,130
planning a project for accessibility

327
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:11,779
from the very beginning and rather than

328
00:14:11,779 --> 00:14:13,190
taking this really detail oriented

329
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:15,830
approach what the past 78 encourages you

330
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:19,730
to do is to say what is the main goal

331
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:24,740
for users of my website so this is a

332
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:27,470
really task oriented approach so if you

333
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:30,260
have an event booking website the most

334
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:32,270
important thing users on your site need

335
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:34,520
to be able to do is fill out that event

336
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:37,130
booking form if it's in marketing or

337
00:14:37,130 --> 00:14:39,440
informational website the most important

338
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,900
thing is that people can read the

339
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:43,640
information and maybe fill out a contact

340
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:46,459
form so it's really from the very very

341
00:14:46,459 --> 00:14:48,709
start of the project identifying when

342
00:14:48,709 --> 00:14:51,200
people come to our website what action

343
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,700
do we want them to do what are they

344
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:56,440
coming here for and then making sure

345
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:59,630
that everybody regardless of ability can

346
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:02,270
complete that action so you might have

347
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:04,160
all this like amazing video and audio

348
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,959
content on your site and it's beautiful

349
00:15:05,959 --> 00:15:07,970
and it's this really rich user

350
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:11,630
experience but if ultimately at the end

351
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:13,730
of the day you need to just convey a few

352
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:15,350
pieces of information and get someone to

353
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:19,040
fill out a form it's okay if you don't

354
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:21,440
subtitle all that video and audio it's

355
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:24,290
wonderful if you can but really put your

356
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:25,779
effort and you focus on your

357
00:15:25,779 --> 00:15:28,029
belapur hours in making sure that these

358
00:15:28,029 --> 00:15:29,769
key goals of the site can be achieved by

359
00:15:29,769 --> 00:15:33,699
all users and I think what really is

360
00:15:33,699 --> 00:15:35,319
wonderful about this is you see that

361
00:15:35,319 --> 00:15:37,810
there's just such a really strong

362
00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:39,160
crossover between what is good

363
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:41,110
accessibility to sign and what is good

364
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:44,259
UX kind of user experience design more

365
00:15:44,259 --> 00:15:45,639
broadly they're really not something

366
00:15:45,639 --> 00:15:47,949
that's like at loggerheads it's really

367
00:15:47,949 --> 00:15:50,649
thinking from the ground up how do we

368
00:15:50,649 --> 00:15:52,809
enable all users of our site to achieve

369
00:15:52,809 --> 00:15:58,089
what they want to achieve ok cool that's

370
00:15:58,089 --> 00:16:00,540
the background let's look at some code

371
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:02,529
so the first thing we're going to I

372
00:16:02,529 --> 00:16:05,699
wanted to actually show you what a

373
00:16:05,699 --> 00:16:08,050
screen reader sounds like but I have

374
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:09,819
this demo version of the software in it

375
00:16:09,819 --> 00:16:14,019
it's just a bad day for audio up here so

376
00:16:14,019 --> 00:16:15,610
maybe I'll just sort of demonstrate for

377
00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:18,009
you who's actually listened to voiceover

378
00:16:18,009 --> 00:16:21,370
on a mac or yeah a few people okay so

379
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:24,490
you have some idea of just how kind of

380
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:27,930
scary and aggressive that voice sounds

381
00:16:27,930 --> 00:16:30,040
when I first started working on this

382
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,930
project and started to test I was just

383
00:16:31,930 --> 00:16:34,660
like so horrified and shocked because on

384
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,309
a page like this what you basically get

385
00:16:36,309 --> 00:16:37,959
is something like better accessibility

386
00:16:37,959 --> 00:16:41,110
with JavaScript strict code mo wa I

387
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:43,180
landmark roles tab index and you're

388
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:46,059
sorry I'm sorry please don't terminate

389
00:16:46,059 --> 00:16:53,649
the etch so it's really people who use

390
00:16:53,649 --> 00:16:54,939
these screen readers to navigate the

391
00:16:54,939 --> 00:16:56,079
internet I just have so much respect

392
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:59,050
because it's like straw denair alee

393
00:16:59,050 --> 00:17:00,009
difficult and just this overwhelming

394
00:17:00,009 --> 00:17:03,550
flow of information coming at you so

395
00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:05,230
what we can do is actually make it a lot

396
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:07,630
easier so rather than it's just like one

397
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:09,850
long body of text that just gets read

398
00:17:09,850 --> 00:17:13,000
out in this like huge stream well well

399
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,069
well where is the actual content of the

400
00:17:15,069 --> 00:17:19,720
page we can start by marking up the

401
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:21,669
various areas of our page with these

402
00:17:21,669 --> 00:17:24,730
things called wa I landmark roles and

403
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:27,250
this basically tells just going to

404
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:32,830
scroll down a little bit the screen

405
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:35,649
reader our voiceover or jaws or whatever

406
00:17:35,649 --> 00:17:39,520
what the semantic role of

407
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:43,060
various parts of the document are so

408
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:45,340
this means that a user is able to

409
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:47,710
basically tab from the banner to the

410
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:49,450
navigation to the main to the

411
00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:51,400
complementary to the content info

412
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,350
without having to read through

413
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:56,650
everything every time which is more or

414
00:17:56,650 --> 00:17:58,420
less if you think about it how sighted

415
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:00,810
users are also scanning through the page

416
00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:03,400
you know you might kind of read the top

417
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:05,710
part once you have two or three pages

418
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:07,510
into browsing a site you're not

419
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:09,040
rereading the navigation every time

420
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:11,380
you're jumping straight to that content

421
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:14,680
area and you're reading from there so

422
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:17,050
using these landmark roles which are

423
00:18:17,050 --> 00:18:19,090
basically just attributes that you put

424
00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:20,920
on you know the containing give or the

425
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,510
containing section or whatever you

426
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:26,200
wonderful html5 semantic container is

427
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:29,620
that you have you're basically just

428
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:32,020
marking up the page like this so kind of

429
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:33,910
very straightforward very easy to do and

430
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:36,220
if you're already using kind of these

431
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:39,700
html5 semantic elements then you know

432
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:41,110
that's kind of just meshes really well

433
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:49,450
with that next thing that you can do and

434
00:18:49,450 --> 00:18:52,750
this is like really probably like almost

435
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:54,520
the most easy thing you can do to

436
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:56,590
improve the user experience of your

437
00:18:56,590 --> 00:18:58,960
pages and that is to give a logical

438
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:03,280
tabindex to your pages now if you write

439
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:06,490
this beautiful from scratch handcrafted

440
00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:10,180
HTML that's like flawless and this

441
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:13,000
polished gem of code then I am really

442
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,740
jealous of you but I work with WordPress

443
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:20,050
a lot so you time to end up with like

444
00:19:20,050 --> 00:19:22,270
content that's being pulled in from all

445
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:23,800
over the place and you've got widgets

446
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,150
and you've got forms and you got this

447
00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:26,980
near that and then they're all throwing

448
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:30,760
tab indexes into the content and what

449
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:32,740
that means is if I'm using the tab key

450
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:35,530
to basically move between the various

451
00:19:35,530 --> 00:19:37,270
elements of the page I'm going to be

452
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:38,770
like appear and then I'm down there and

453
00:19:38,770 --> 00:19:40,330
then i'm doing a form that I'm over here

454
00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:43,660
and I don't know what I'm doing so let's

455
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:45,460
take all of that and let's just wipe it

456
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:48,640
back to zero so that when I tab through

457
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,290
the page and basically tabbing just

458
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:53,320
takes you from one focusable element to

459
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:53,560
the

460
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:56,170
X so generally from you know one link to

461
00:19:56,170 --> 00:19:58,390
the next thing to the next thing then

462
00:19:58,390 --> 00:20:01,030
I'm going to move through the page in a

463
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:02,410
logical order that makes it a lot easier

464
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:05,530
for me to understand and really that's

465
00:20:05,530 --> 00:20:07,990
just this tiny handy snippet of code

466
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:11,260
here dump it in your in your projects

467
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:13,600
and you've just massively improved the

468
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,550
user experience for a whole group of

469
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:23,210
people so it's that easy folks but easy

470
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:25,540
another little useful fragment is this

471
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:27,220
one here which is the skip navigation

472
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:29,890
link so there's kind of some debate

473
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:31,450
about whether this is still necessary

474
00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:33,600
now that we have these landmark roles

475
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,980
but you know what I think kind of err on

476
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:38,440
the side of caution and supporting

477
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:40,120
people who maybe have older technology

478
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:43,060
and all this basically is is a small

479
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:45,610
link that appears only when you focus on

480
00:20:45,610 --> 00:20:48,640
it and it's just an in page length down

481
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,880
to the main content of the page so as

482
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,800
soon as I press tab and focus on the

483
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,750
link I can see it there I can press

484
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:58,240
Enter it will move the focus of the

485
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,910
screen reader down to the main content

486
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:03,910
and will start reading from there but if

487
00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:05,980
you're a sighted user or you don't use

488
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:07,480
the keyboard to navigate the site you'll

489
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:10,000
never even know it's there so here's

490
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,670
just some CSS to show how you can hide

491
00:21:12,670 --> 00:21:22,330
it yep okay

492
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:27,090
okay then screen reader text sometimes

493
00:21:27,090 --> 00:21:28,320
you want to give a little bit of extra

494
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,780
information or context to people who are

495
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:34,530
using a screen reader so this might be

496
00:21:34,530 --> 00:21:36,660
for example if you're as we're about to

497
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:39,270
see showing a map if you're looking at a

498
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:41,610
map this is really obvious to sighted

499
00:21:41,610 --> 00:21:45,350
users it's a map it doesn't necessarily

500
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:47,580
come out that way when you're reading it

501
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:50,130
with a screen reader or you might have

502
00:21:50,130 --> 00:21:52,350
something that has some specific type of

503
00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:55,410
interaction that you have added an extra

504
00:21:55,410 --> 00:21:57,510
keyboard control so for example to

505
00:21:57,510 --> 00:22:00,299
filtering or to the carousel things like

506
00:22:00,299 --> 00:22:03,090
this so you might just need to give a

507
00:22:03,090 --> 00:22:04,320
little bit of context that's only

508
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:08,160
relevant to these users but you want to

509
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,020
hide it from sighted users so

510
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:12,330
unfortunately if you put display none on

511
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:16,049
something then a screen reader

512
00:22:16,049 --> 00:22:17,640
technology is kind of smart enough to

513
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:20,790
know don't read that bit out so we have

514
00:22:20,790 --> 00:22:22,500
to kind of do this very convoluted

515
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:26,970
little CSS snippet to basically have

516
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:29,070
text that's there in the right place and

517
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:30,570
will be read out by screen readers and

518
00:22:30,570 --> 00:22:35,900
will be invisible to everybody else cool

519
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:39,080
so they're kind of some just little

520
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:41,160
small I mean I really think these are

521
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:43,950
small things that you can do that you

522
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:45,840
don't require you to like jump through

523
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,669
all the hoops that you need to get that

524
00:22:47,669 --> 00:22:50,010
WCAG kind of certification stamp of

525
00:22:50,010 --> 00:22:52,740
approval but really are going to help a

526
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:54,480
lot of people just have a much much

527
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:58,559
better experience on your site I've got

528
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:00,179
a few minutes left so in their final

529
00:23:00,179 --> 00:23:01,350
minutes I'm just going to talk a little

530
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:04,049
bit about how or the approach that I've

531
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:06,330
taken to adapting some really common

532
00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:09,630
libraries to just make the experience

533
00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:11,880
for keyboard users and screen reader

534
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:15,650
users a little bit better and more fun

535
00:23:15,650 --> 00:23:18,720
so as I said before this is definitely

536
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:22,100
not any kind of higher level amazingly

537
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:26,669
sophisticated code this is like this is

538
00:23:26,669 --> 00:23:29,250
this is HTML email we're talking people

539
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:31,000
this is like

540
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,920
you have like all the different

541
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,810
operating systems and then how they

542
00:23:34,810 --> 00:23:36,160
interact with all the different browsers

543
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,660
which then interact really differently

544
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:38,770
with all the different screen reader

545
00:23:38,770 --> 00:23:41,290
software so testing for this and the

546
00:23:41,290 --> 00:23:43,420
amount of quirks and just undocumented

547
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:48,000
bugs it's really a pain and quite ugly

548
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,530
so this is kind of some hacky approaches

549
00:23:50,530 --> 00:23:51,970
to sort of making things a little bit

550
00:23:51,970 --> 00:23:57,680
better which I hope you will find useful

551
00:23:57,690 --> 00:24:02,830
so leaflet is a lovely open-source

552
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:06,520
mapping JavaScript library I use it a

553
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:09,160
lot if you do any kind of database stuff

554
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:12,400
it's really fantastic if you don't want

555
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,320
to just work with Google all the time

556
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:17,590
it's great unfortunately there's some

557
00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:21,280
problems with how the leaflet library

558
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:24,040
works just sort of out of the box so

559
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:27,820
that one of the big things is that every

560
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:31,960
single one of the image tiles has an alt

561
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:35,080
text and that alt text is the latitude

562
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:38,350
and longitude of that particular image

563
00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:42,340
tile so while you're reading through the

564
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:43,900
page and you're like that's great and

565
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:45,100
then there's a map and I can see there's

566
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:46,600
a map with some pins and some markers in

567
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:49,480
it if you're using jaws or voiceover

568
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:51,460
what you get is blah blah blah blah blah

569
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:55,090
blah blah 1743 22111 and you're like

570
00:24:55,090 --> 00:24:59,680
what do I image 17 44 45 any like what

571
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:01,210
why did I just get half an hour of

572
00:25:01,210 --> 00:25:02,860
numbers right out to me in this

573
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:06,280
meaningless stream which is obviously

574
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:08,010
like a really terrible user experience

575
00:25:08,010 --> 00:25:11,590
so one of the ways I found to kind of

576
00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:15,310
get rid of this was basically to for a

577
00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:16,930
start don't know how where you can see

578
00:25:16,930 --> 00:25:19,270
the code there but removing all the

579
00:25:19,270 --> 00:25:21,640
images which are providing the shadows

580
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:23,860
on the markers because they don't really

581
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:25,000
need to be there and we don't really

582
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:31,090
need to hear the alt text of shadow we

583
00:25:31,090 --> 00:25:34,900
also want to get rid of what I'm

584
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:37,390
actually doing there yeah so we're

585
00:25:37,390 --> 00:25:39,970
setting this this all these other images

586
00:25:39,970 --> 00:25:41,650
to have the role of presentation and

587
00:25:41,650 --> 00:25:44,370
that signals to

588
00:25:44,370 --> 00:25:46,630
screen readers that this is just here

589
00:25:46,630 --> 00:25:49,660
for looks it's not content so don't read

590
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:56,800
it out finally we also have a problem

591
00:25:56,800 --> 00:26:03,090
where if we are have these markers here

592
00:26:03,090 --> 00:26:05,620
we don't necessarily have a really nice

593
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:09,850
kind of logical tab index so in this one

594
00:26:09,850 --> 00:26:11,680
that I've kind of adapted a little bit

595
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:13,390
what we get here is when we click on the

596
00:26:13,390 --> 00:26:15,910
marker the text inside the marker then

597
00:26:15,910 --> 00:26:19,590
comes into focus so this tells the

598
00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:22,600
screen reader you should now jump like

599
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:24,010
you were going to give focus to this

600
00:26:24,010 --> 00:26:26,620
attribute and you should start reading

601
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:29,560
out from there then when I press tab I

602
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:32,860
get the close button so this is kind of

603
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:34,420
the opposite of how the leaflet library

604
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:35,920
does it by default and there's sort of a

605
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:37,210
bunch of code there that you can more or

606
00:26:37,210 --> 00:26:39,070
less copy and paste and dumped into your

607
00:26:39,070 --> 00:26:41,100
work if you're interested in using this

608
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:44,140
once I close I don't know if you can see

609
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:46,510
the blue kind of square around this but

610
00:26:46,510 --> 00:26:49,180
my focus comes back to wherever I was

611
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:52,540
before I opened that marker so this is

612
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:54,550
just actually making all those kind of

613
00:26:54,550 --> 00:26:56,560
markers on the page accessible to people

614
00:26:56,560 --> 00:27:02,140
who are using a keyboard okay three

615
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:07,990
minutes and talk quickly about this

616
00:27:07,990 --> 00:27:10,750
carousel so our carousel I mean what

617
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:14,640
picky carousel library this is mine I

618
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:19,240
like it so this is quite quite easy to

619
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,980
adapt so that you're also able to

620
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:22,870
control it using the left and right keys

621
00:27:22,870 --> 00:27:31,240
of the keyboard so another thing we sort

622
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:32,860
of did here which I kind of found quiet

623
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:36,430
nice if I just tab through is that when

624
00:27:36,430 --> 00:27:39,610
the item comes into focus we actually

625
00:27:39,610 --> 00:27:42,100
then and only then show some additional

626
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:44,950
information that's for people who are

627
00:27:44,950 --> 00:27:49,510
navigating using a keyboard so then once

628
00:27:49,510 --> 00:27:51,040
this pops up and I can see all this

629
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:52,780
comes into focus the only reason why

630
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:54,100
this would come into focus is if

631
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:56,260
someone's tabbing through the page then

632
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:57,460
I'm going to give the

633
00:27:57,460 --> 00:27:59,559
this ability to control it with the left

634
00:27:59,559 --> 00:28:03,010
and right arrows and like most carousel

635
00:28:03,010 --> 00:28:04,539
libraries are going to be exposing some

636
00:28:04,539 --> 00:28:07,090
sort of previous and next event methods

637
00:28:07,090 --> 00:28:10,990
so you can kind of tap into that and and

638
00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:12,429
give that extra layer of keyboard

639
00:28:12,429 --> 00:28:17,460
functionality I probably don't need to

640
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:25,210
look at that in much detail cool I yeah

641
00:28:25,210 --> 00:28:26,500
I'll briefly show that what I do with

642
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:33,490
isotope again this is kind of just this

643
00:28:33,490 --> 00:28:35,049
is like a really would be an awesome

644
00:28:35,049 --> 00:28:38,529
case for using this Wa Aria stuff which

645
00:28:38,529 --> 00:28:40,270
is supposed to kind of alert the screen

646
00:28:40,270 --> 00:28:42,309
reader that there's like changes

647
00:28:42,309 --> 00:28:44,980
appearing on the page but the support

648
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:46,929
for that is like pachi to non-existent

649
00:28:46,929 --> 00:28:49,179
right now so maybe in kind of two years

650
00:28:49,179 --> 00:28:50,799
time you'll be able to basically just

651
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:55,090
say the role of this kind of area is an

652
00:28:55,090 --> 00:28:56,799
application and the screen reader should

653
00:28:56,799 --> 00:28:58,600
automatically be kind of watching it and

654
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:01,899
checking for changes to the Dom but at

655
00:29:01,899 --> 00:29:04,690
the moment it's not so we just kind of

656
00:29:04,690 --> 00:29:06,520
came around to more or less hacking this

657
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:10,480
where when you select an element and it

658
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:13,330
gets a filter we just show a small kind

659
00:29:13,330 --> 00:29:14,799
of little text here that says three

660
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:19,090
items found and focus is like shifted to

661
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:21,760
that so that if you're kind of using a

662
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:24,340
screen reader or your arm yeah if you're

663
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:26,370
if you need to use a screen reader you

664
00:29:26,370 --> 00:29:29,049
can't see that there's only three items

665
00:29:29,049 --> 00:29:31,299
that have been found because your vision

666
00:29:31,299 --> 00:29:33,789
impaired instead we shift the focus to

667
00:29:33,789 --> 00:29:36,309
hear and provide some other additional

668
00:29:36,309 --> 00:29:37,779
feedback about what's happened as a

669
00:29:37,779 --> 00:29:39,669
result of that filtering outcome no

670
00:29:39,669 --> 00:29:53,810
filtering action okay um lost my slides

671
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:59,040
I have 14 seconds 13 but i will speak

672
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:02,430
very briefly about testing testing super

673
00:30:02,430 --> 00:30:04,890
important do as much as it as you can of

674
00:30:04,890 --> 00:30:08,790
course functionality testing you know

675
00:30:08,790 --> 00:30:12,320
there's like as I said pick your battles

676
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:16,770
internet explorer but try to test with

677
00:30:16,770 --> 00:30:18,540
as much technology as you can it's very

678
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:20,340
enlightening I think just to spend time

679
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:21,750
working with this software and just

680
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:25,620
seeing how challenging it is to use you

681
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:26,910
know if you're on a Mac it's as simple

682
00:30:26,910 --> 00:30:28,830
as just hitting command in f5 and you

683
00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:31,650
can get started straight away if you're

684
00:30:31,650 --> 00:30:34,200
on Windows like me the only person in

685
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:38,280
the room you can download jaws and have

686
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:41,460
a play with that other really really

687
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:43,470
useful thing to do is task based testing

688
00:30:43,470 --> 00:30:44,880
so this kind of comes back to what I was

689
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:47,190
talking about earlier about how you want

690
00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:50,040
to identify user goals and make sure

691
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:52,650
people can actually fulfill them so it's

692
00:30:52,650 --> 00:30:54,420
really awesome if you are able to work

693
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:57,300
with people who are have some disability

694
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:58,770
in some way and they're able to give you

695
00:30:58,770 --> 00:31:01,740
feedback to set them tasks so to say go

696
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:04,020
to this page and make a booking find out

697
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:06,000
this contact information of this person

698
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,650
and see if they're actually able to

699
00:31:07,650 --> 00:31:09,780
successfully complete those tasks or not

700
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:11,970
and then and only then elicit some

701
00:31:11,970 --> 00:31:13,290
feedback about like what do you think

702
00:31:13,290 --> 00:31:14,820
about the fonts and the colors and blah

703
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:16,710
blah blah because it's very subjective

704
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:18,540
but if someone's able to successfully

705
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:20,730
complete a task or not that's really

706
00:31:20,730 --> 00:31:24,540
what you're interested in here so that's

707
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:26,220
my time thank you very much for

708
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:28,380
listening I hope you found something of

709
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:34,370
you
