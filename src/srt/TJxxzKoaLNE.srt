00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:15,619

alright gutentag CSS cough alright I

2
00:00:15,619 --> 00:00:17,940
learned that in the taxi ride this

3
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:19,289
morning so that's all I know

4
00:00:19,289 --> 00:00:22,050
but welcome everybody from lunch who's

5
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:25,140
still coming back from lunch this talk

6
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:29,340
is called let's webdev like it's 1999 so

7
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:31,349
I actually have a question for everyone

8
00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:34,110
here can you raise your hand if you were

9
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:36,960
doing web development back in 1999 raise

10
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,790
your hand if you're doing it back then

11
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:42,300
okay all right a small handful actually

12
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:45,539
okay so that's good so I'm hoping to

13
00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:47,850
share a little bit about my development

14
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:50,190
story and kind of walk us down memory

15
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:52,469
lane those of us who were doing it back

16
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:55,079
then but for most of you here I guess

17
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:57,510
it'll be you know a history lesson for

18
00:00:57,510 --> 00:00:59,160
all of you about what we had to do back

19
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:01,920
then so I'll kind of sit back and take

20
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,680
it in and hopefully I will learn some

21
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:07,890
new things along the way as well and we

22
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:10,170
can appreciate kind of where we are

23
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:13,799
based upon where we've come from so the

24
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:16,049
slides that I have for the talk they're

25
00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:18,240
available online so I have a link at the

26
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,890

30
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:30,630
if I can get everyone to stand up I want

31
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:34,409

just born in January so I'm a principal

68
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:21,390
front-end engineer at Eventbrite and I

69
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:24,690
work on a newly developed team called

70
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:26,820
our data and recommendations team we're

71
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:29,760
kind of focused on providing insights to

72
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,370
event creators like the organizers that

73
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:33,870
created this conference giving them

74
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:35,400
insights to help them be even more

75
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:38,190
successful sell more tickets and things

76
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:41,280

00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:51,810
last night so I know who won and

80
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:53,520
everything like that I'm gonna miss on

81
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:56,130
Sunday but I think this is yeah this was

82
00:03:56,130 --> 00:03:57,600
a better idea to come here and share

83
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:00,180
with you also I'm not sad or anything

84
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:02,400
like that I'm happy to be here I'm gonna

85
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,590
let you know but I don't want to talk

86
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:07,050
about me now I want to talk about me 20

87
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:07,709
years ago

88
00:04:07,709 --> 00:04:10,470
okay and it started off I learned my

89
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:13,980
first programming language basic in the

90
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:16,620
summer of 1998 when I was going into

91
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:19,359
high school and I use

92
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:21,219
basic the programming language to start

93
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:23,669
programming or building apps for my

94
00:04:23,669 --> 00:04:26,860
ti-83 calculator when I was in high

95
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:29,620
school for my I started building math

96
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:32,229
programs mainly and I would create

97
00:04:32,229 --> 00:04:36,580
programs to what I said I I checked my

98
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:38,979
homework and I check the answers to my

99
00:04:38,979 --> 00:04:42,580
tests with my apps that I would build so

100
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:44,949
I'll build a slope calculator or

101
00:04:44,949 --> 00:04:46,780
whatever I was doing an algebra geometry

102
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:48,699
just plug in the numbers and it would

103
00:04:48,699 --> 00:04:50,349
give me the answer and I would verify

104
00:04:50,349 --> 00:04:53,439
what I did so I figured if I was able to

105
00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:55,629
build the app it wasn't cheating at

106
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:57,090
least that's what I told myself

107
00:04:57,090 --> 00:05:01,240
so then I wanted to find a way to teach

108
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,099
others how they could build their apps

109
00:05:03,099 --> 00:05:04,990
program as well because people were

110
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:06,460
asking me how they could do that

111
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:09,610
so naturally I created a website and I

112
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:10,810
have to go to the wayback machine

113
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:14,740
actually to find it it isn't it is very

114
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:16,750
beautiful as you can see here I'm

115
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:20,020
totally a designer it was called basic

116
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:22,900
guru online because apparently I was a

117
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:26,169
guru at the age of 14 or 15 or whatever

118
00:05:26,169 --> 00:05:29,740
and it's hosted on geo cities for any of

119
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:32,650
you all from back then geo cities is

120
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:35,319
like the service there was also angel

121
00:05:35,319 --> 00:05:38,139
fire and tripod but like geo cities was

122
00:05:38,139 --> 00:05:39,759
like the main one I'm I'm talking like

123
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:43,569
early 2000 so it was a full web

124
00:05:43,569 --> 00:05:47,500
application but basic guru online and I

125
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:50,560
updated it basically by pushing static

126
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,400
files static HTML CSS files like

127
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,430
directly to their servers with FTP just

128
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:59,680
like from my computer to their servers

129
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:04,360
and and they handle all the backend and

130
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:07,960
such so looking at the top I definitely

131
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:11,529
made the logo in Microsoft Paint

132
00:06:11,529 --> 00:06:16,210
using a clipart from PowerPoint and I

133
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:19,000
used Comic Sans because Comic Sans so

134
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,740
like just come out that time and it was

135
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:23,860
super duper popular then everything was

136
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:27,279
in Comic Sans and then in the middle

137
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:29,800
there I have my you know trusty hit

138
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,839
counter that everyone had on their sites

139
00:06:31,839 --> 00:06:32,840
back then as well

140
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:36,440
apparently it was broken now but I had

141
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:40,820
you know tens of thousands of hits since

142
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:44,540
August 2 2000 and then on the right for

143
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:46,190
some reason I thought it was a good idea

144
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:48,740
to show the current date for some reason

145
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:50,870
though that was a good idea but it still

146
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:53,300
works like 20 years later like this is

147
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:55,100
the reason why javascript is backwards

148
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:57,500
compatible so that's someone 20 years

149
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,180
later their website could still work

150
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:01,970
which is awesome and then at the bottom

151
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:04,190
in the middle of all this text that you

152
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:07,460
have to read I mentioned that a well the

153
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:09,919
AOL browser is the preferred browser to

154
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:12,979
view the site but it should be okay and

155
00:07:12,979 --> 00:07:14,979
in an explorer and Netscape Navigator

156
00:07:14,979 --> 00:07:18,169
okay this is how old it was best viewed

157
00:07:18,169 --> 00:07:23,540
and 800 by 600 resolution so then

158
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:27,410
further on on the right again I have

159
00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:29,750
this Internet poll about connection

160
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:32,240
speed internet connection speed I wish I

161
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,130
had the results of what they were but

162
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:36,050
you know dial-up was a thing back then

163
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:39,680
and then at the bottom was this bottom

164
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,510
frame and it was this fixed height

165
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:45,229
bottom footer I guess so the main window

166
00:07:45,229 --> 00:07:47,060
would scroll and then it would just be

167
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:49,820
fixed at the bottom and I'll talk a

168
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:51,110
little bit more about how that all

169
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:54,050
worked so but surprisingly and all this

170
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:56,090
I never used a scrolling marquee or a

171
00:07:56,090 --> 00:07:58,010
blink tag or anything like that I'm

172
00:07:58,010 --> 00:08:02,000
pretty impressed with my younger self so

173
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,530
just for fun this is what Yahoo looked

174
00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:06,590
like at the time and if you look if you

175
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:08,539
can look at the very bottom it says

176
00:08:08,539 --> 00:08:11,660
powered by Compaq which was funny and

177
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:15,530
then this is also amazon.com as well and

178
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:16,970
if you look at the bottom it says

179
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:22,490
Microsoft XP is now shipping yes okay

180
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:27,650
so but before css3 and before flexbox we

181
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:30,590
needed ways to layout our pages okay and

182
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:33,469
many times we would have some kind of

183
00:08:33,469 --> 00:08:35,479
navigation that we wanted fixed either

184
00:08:35,479 --> 00:08:38,209
it's a fixed header at the top or you

185
00:08:38,209 --> 00:08:40,849
have your left nav or in my case I

186
00:08:40,849 --> 00:08:42,530
thought it was a good to have a bottom

187
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:44,830
nav fixed at the bottom

188
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:46,390
and we needed ways to be able to build

189
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:49,000
that now you may be thinking that I'm

190
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,160
talking about tables right a table best

191
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:53,050
layout but no I'm talking about

192
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:55,360
something that comes even before a table

193
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,700
based layouts and I'm talking about

194
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:01,690
frame set yeah all these old people like

195
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:04,510
whoa frames said I remember frame sets

196
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:08,170
yes okay so for those of you I'll get

197
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:09,700
into what frame sets are in a little bit

198
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:13,480
but take a look at this HTML code that I

199
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:16,510
have here like it's in all caps like

200
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:18,460
back then we decided we wanted to scream

201
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:19,870
every time we were writing our code

202
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:23,950
right and we had attributes like margin

203
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:25,960
height and frame border like we're not

204
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,460
even quoting those we're just putting

205
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:29,290
the numbers right after the equals sign

206
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:32,050
and like take a look at the frame tags

207
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:35,170
like they're not even self closing like

208
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:36,760
I don't know how the browser figured

209
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:39,130
that out like that's amazing the web was

210
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:43,870
just crazy back then but so this is the

211
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:45,550
layout that we're actually building

212
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:47,380
right now it's kind of this contrived

213
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:49,660
example that I want to show so once

214
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:51,880
again we have a frame at the top and

215
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,800
that's fixed and then we have three

216
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:56,740
frames beneath it and the one on the

217
00:09:56,740 --> 00:10:00,280
left is uh it is frame - and that's

218
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:02,800
fixed the one on the right is frame four

219
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,780
that's fixed and then in the middle

220
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:08,350
frame three just has it can be variable

221
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:10,120
width depending on the size of your

222
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:13,180
window it's okay let's go back to the

223
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:17,620
code now so starting off we have this

224
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:20,530
frame okay and the frames actually

225
00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:24,490
pointed to specific HTML pages like you

226
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:26,200
would actually have a HTML document

227
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:31,570
called header h2 ml or Navi HTML etc etc

228
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:37,180
and then the frame set itself allows you

229
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:39,520
to align things either by rows or by

230
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:43,090
columns and they can even be nested so

231
00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:44,740
you can have a frame set inside of a

232
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:47,770
frame set and take a look at this

233
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:50,410
asterisk you know syntax here which

234
00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:52,360
basically says that the column in this

235
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,760
case will take up the remainder of the

236
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:57,340
space which is actually pretty fancy for

237
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:58,480
20 years

238
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,910
ago right that it could just be fluid

239
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:03,400
that way and of course there's visual

240
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:06,730
styling that's mixed up in the markup as

241
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:11,200
well so frames by default had borders

242
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,170
around them so you could add frame

243
00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:17,410
border zero to turn off the frames that

244
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:22,090
way but if you left on the borders the

245
00:11:22,090 --> 00:11:24,070
border the borders could be dragged and

246
00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:26,320
resized so you could turn off that

247
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,570
attribute with the no resize attribute

248
00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:32,200
there to prevent resizing and and then

249
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,150
last but not least we have this

250
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:37,090
this name attribute they're like what

251
00:11:37,090 --> 00:11:39,040
exactly is the name attribute for it's

252
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,590
pointing to content again with with no

253
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:43,990
quotes it's pointing to content so let

254
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:48,180
me explain how that worked so in

255
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:50,350
addition to you know wanting this

256
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:53,200
grid-like layout we also didn't want to

257
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,450
refresh the entire page every time we

258
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:58,360
navigate it around right so we knew the

259
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,490
header was gonna stay fixed we knew the

260
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:02,950
nav on the left was gonna stay fixed so

261
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:06,130
inside of the nav we were able to say

262
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:08,230
when I click on something that the

263
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:10,840
content would actually change so we're

264
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,850
always all used to saying you know

265
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:15,550
target equals underscore blank to open

266
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:17,500
up a new window unless the only time we

267
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,720
ever use the target attribute well

268
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:20,950
there's actually other reasons to use

269
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:22,450
the target attribute or lease there

270
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:24,040
there were other reasons to use the

271
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:26,080
target attribute and that was the target

272
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:28,600
other frames in order to update their

273
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,910
content so in this case when you click

274
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:33,250
on the link the main content would

275
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:35,940
update with whatever link we had and

276
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:40,180
also for some reason the Allies weren't

277
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:41,860
closed then either maybe that's

278
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:43,480
something we did or something I did I

279
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:46,540
don't know but Li tags were just open

280
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:51,250
and by the way frame set was deprecated

281
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:54,160
in html5 so it's not something we can

282
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,830
use anymore but all the browser still

283
00:12:56,830 --> 00:12:59,860
seem to support it so I guess you could

284
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:04,150
go off in and go old-school now but if

285
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:05,530
you've been able if you've been keeping

286
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:07,540
up with everything going on in CSS land

287
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:09,910
right what I just described sounds very

288
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:12,760
similar to CSS grid which Rachel showed

289
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:15,730
us earlier and we can basically

290
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:18,430
accomplish the same thing with frame

291
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:21,370
sets as we can with CSS grid with this

292
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:23,950
code here so I'm not going to go through

293
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:25,450
the code that's not really the purpose

294
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:27,790
of this but you know notice how the the

295
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:30,340
main tag is actually above the nav tag

296
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:33,850
so that's for SEO purposes of course so

297
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:35,860
that the main content which is more

298
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:38,170
important can show up first but then the

299
00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:40,060
grid layout allows us to put things

300
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:42,880
wherever we want whether it's small

301
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,620
screen large screen so that it can

302
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:49,150
display the way that we like it okay but

303
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:51,850
you know what CSS grid it's way way way

304
00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:54,070
too modern for us so let's go let's go

305
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:55,330
back to decades

306
00:13:55,330 --> 00:13:58,870
again okay so let's say we have this

307
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:01,060
schedule right that's the schedule for

308
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:04,810
the CSS coffee you to 2019 schedule

309
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:07,960
today and like all we want to do is just

310
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:11,170
indent the name of the speaker 40 pixels

311
00:14:11,170 --> 00:14:14,290
in from the left so naturally we would

312
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:17,200
use some CSS selector like margin left

313
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,870
40 pixels or padding left 40 pixels or

314
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:21,940
whatever the case may be we have so much

315
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:24,490
at CSS at our disposal to be able to

316
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:26,350
make it happen so it's simple enough

317
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:26,620
right

318
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:29,380
or maybe we would use bootstrap of grid

319
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:31,390
system and we would burn a left column

320
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:33,370
or something sophisticated like that but

321
00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:37,270
we would leverage CSS but what do you do

322
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:41,050
what do you use when CSS doesn't exist

323
00:14:41,050 --> 00:14:43,810
yet or at the very least you're not sure

324
00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:45,760
that CSS is going to exist in all the

325
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:49,030
browsers where your sites gonna be well

326
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:53,680
you would use a 1x1 gif and also known

327
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,150
as a spacer gif

328
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:58,840
yes and I say gif not Jeff okay so if

329
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:02,350
you say jiff too bad but what it was it

330
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:04,570
was like it was this hundred percent

331
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:08,200
transparent see-through image okay and

332
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,790
it was teeny in size because it is

333
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:13,510
actually 1x1 pixels and we used it to

334
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:16,510
create our pixel perfect spacing and our

335
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:19,690
pixel perfect layouts before CSS existed

336
00:15:19,690 --> 00:15:22,630
so it could work in the horizontal or

337
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:24,820
vertical direction you would just take

338
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:25,180
the

339
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:27,490
give it a whiff or give it a height or

340
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:29,530
give it both and you're able to space

341
00:15:29,530 --> 00:15:31,840
things and give things margins and

342
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:35,110
padding's and separate things however

343
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:37,780
you wanted and we used them like all

344
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:40,120
over the place all over the place and

345
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:42,100
again a responsive design wasn't a thing

346
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:44,050
at this time so we were just designing

347
00:15:44,050 --> 00:15:47,260
for like one screen width or whatever so

348
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:48,940
we didn't have to worry about mobile so

349
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:53,400
we would just use 1x1 pixels everywhere

350
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:57,070
and for this you know maybe you could

351
00:15:57,070 --> 00:15:58,630
throw a whole bunch of non-breaking

352
00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:01,090
spaces as well which I totally did

353
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:03,940
number of times as well

354
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:05,950
but for this specific case you know

355
00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:07,750
spacing with non-breaking spaces

356
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:10,690
depending on the font and the font size

357
00:16:10,690 --> 00:16:13,840
so things may not line up exactly how

358
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:16,330
you would want to use them so spacer

359
00:16:16,330 --> 00:16:20,160
gifts were definitely at our disposal

360
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:23,200
okay and then CSS became a thing which

361
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,240
was great so we're talking early 2000s

362
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:27,640
great we have some CSS we can use it

363
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:30,910
you've got HTML and we have CSS this is

364
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:34,390
gonna be awesome so what could we do so

365
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:36,730
no longer did we have to put text or

366
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:38,830
link or background colors on the body

367
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:41,800
tag anymore or no longer do we have to

368
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:44,520
use the font tag for styling everything

369
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:47,380
like the font tag is like obsolete it's

370
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:49,240
not deprecated it's just like gone from

371
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:51,580
the browser's now and I definitely use

372
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:53,650
the font tag like everywhere I want it

373
00:16:53,650 --> 00:16:55,120
to style something I want to make

374
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,400
something red font tag I wanted to make

375
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,650
something bigger font tag I wanted to

376
00:16:59,650 --> 00:17:01,930
make something have a background font

377
00:17:01,930 --> 00:17:03,520
tag everywhere everywhere everywhere

378
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:06,280
font tags didn't use spans always font

379
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:10,480
tags so we do have to do that anymore we

380
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,339
were still using tables obviously for

381
00:17:12,339 --> 00:17:15,700
layouts of course but no longer did we

382
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:17,530
have to have the styling for the table

383
00:17:17,530 --> 00:17:20,830
in the markup anymore we could put it in

384
00:17:20,830 --> 00:17:24,630
a separate file because we had CSS

385
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:27,730
however you know what we ended up using

386
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:30,760
CSS the most for or at least what I

387
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:32,950
ended up using CSS the most for in the

388
00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:35,320
beginning it was

389
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:38,380
to screw with links okay and the default

390
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:41,649
link styling so I could make the default

391
00:17:41,649 --> 00:17:45,009
link color like different and without an

392
00:17:45,009 --> 00:17:47,019
underline like what

393
00:17:47,019 --> 00:17:49,419
and like visited links of course we're

394
00:17:49,419 --> 00:17:51,159
different they're always purple for some

395
00:17:51,159 --> 00:17:52,630
reason so I could make them the same

396
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:55,750
color now and undo that and the best

397
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:58,570
part was is that when I hovered over the

398
00:17:58,570 --> 00:18:00,940
link I could change the color and then

399
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:03,220
add an underline like look how dynamic

400
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:05,620
that is like you guys are looking at me

401
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:07,960
now like what's the big deal but man 20

402
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:10,120
years ago being able to do that like

403
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:12,820
being able to add that dynamism was

404
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:15,490
amazing because at the beginning CSS was

405
00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:18,759
only just for taking the styling out of

406
00:18:18,759 --> 00:18:20,259
the markup we didn't have all of the

407
00:18:20,259 --> 00:18:24,909
fancy transitions and flexbox and all

408
00:18:24,909 --> 00:18:27,580
the different properties that we have

409
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:29,559
now to create you know sophisticated

410
00:18:29,559 --> 00:18:33,639
dynamic layouts all we had was just a

411
00:18:33,639 --> 00:18:35,529
separation of styles so be able to mess

412
00:18:35,529 --> 00:18:37,600
with links was like the coolest thing

413
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:42,549
that I could do at that time ok so then

414
00:18:42,549 --> 00:18:44,799
moving on there's this there's this camp

415
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:48,429
of people right who believe that CSS is

416
00:18:48,429 --> 00:18:52,240
so easy right so so easy then there's

417
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,730
this other camp over here that believes

418
00:18:54,730 --> 00:18:57,370
that CSS is like so hard that we should

419
00:18:57,370 --> 00:18:59,440
just move all of our styling into

420
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:02,320
JavaScript right and do CSS nsj right

421
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,029
and I'm not trying to get in the middle

422
00:19:04,029 --> 00:19:08,679
of that war on stage for sure but 20

423
00:19:08,679 --> 00:19:09,159
years ago

424
00:19:09,159 --> 00:19:12,549
debugging styling was actually a pain it

425
00:19:12,549 --> 00:19:15,549
was really difficult and because there

426
00:19:15,549 --> 00:19:17,980
was no easy way to know what the browser

427
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:20,259
was rendering or even to know what

428
00:19:20,259 --> 00:19:22,840
classes was actually being applied like

429
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:24,909
if I wrote a CSS class is it actually

430
00:19:24,909 --> 00:19:27,340
targeting this Dom element or a

431
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:31,629
specificity rules colliding or what's

432
00:19:31,629 --> 00:19:33,250
going on and it was compounding

433
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:36,460
compounded by the fact that the sizing

434
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:38,679
of elements the layout of elements the

435
00:19:38,679 --> 00:19:40,600
z-index issues like I didn't know what

436
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,970
was going on so would always throw on

437
00:19:42,970 --> 00:19:45,700
dummy colors or add dummy border colors

438
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:48,309
just to see what was going on in the

439
00:19:48,309 --> 00:19:49,240
markup

440
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:51,460
and and to see kind of what the bounding

441
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:54,640
boxes were it was basically like console

442
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:57,970
dot log of CSS at that time and of

443
00:19:57,970 --> 00:20:00,220
course in order to do this right I'd

444
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:02,200
have to make the change in my editor

445
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,750
probably notepad make the change in my

446
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:08,049
editor save it reload the browser see

447
00:20:08,049 --> 00:20:11,260
the results pull out my hair because I

448
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:14,289
had hair back then pull up my hair wish

449
00:20:14,289 --> 00:20:17,350
stackoverflow existed and then change

450
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:19,149
something and try to see again right and

451
00:20:19,149 --> 00:20:20,799
that was the iterative loop that we had

452
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:26,529
back then and then Firebug came along

453
00:20:26,529 --> 00:20:29,649
and like mid 2000s and it completely

454
00:20:29,649 --> 00:20:33,460
changed the game like this was right

455
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:34,960
around when I started developing like

456
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,490
full-time

457
00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:39,279
having Firebug and I don't know how many

458
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:40,659
people have heard of it but it was an

459
00:20:40,659 --> 00:20:43,450
extension of Firefox initially before it

460
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:45,909
became embedded in the browser and it

461
00:20:45,909 --> 00:20:47,679
got me to actually move from Internet

462
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:49,870
Explorer over to Firefox at the time

463
00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:52,870
this was before chrome existed and I

464
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:56,470
could actually like see the CSS in the

465
00:20:56,470 --> 00:20:58,630
browser and make changes to it I could

466
00:20:58,630 --> 00:21:01,200
debug the javascript in the browser like

467
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,090
completely completely revolutionary and

468
00:21:04,090 --> 00:21:06,010
I think it actually paved the way for

469
00:21:06,010 --> 00:21:09,970
all of the amazing kind of web 2.0 Ajax

470
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:12,190
style applications that came afterwards

471
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:14,890
because we were able to debug and see

472
00:21:14,890 --> 00:21:17,110
things happen in such real time that

473
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:18,789
enabled us to do bigger and better

474
00:21:18,789 --> 00:21:19,360
things

475
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,940
so huge Aang and Jason they kind of

476
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:25,000
showed us all the benefits of dev tools

477
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,100
right earlier today that have even

478
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:28,750
allowed us to go even further than that

479
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:31,390
and now Firefox lets you inspect the

480
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:34,299
grid that we're writing and the Flex box

481
00:21:34,299 --> 00:21:36,909
that's there or a firefox allows us to

482
00:21:36,909 --> 00:21:38,919
inspect the fonts like all of these are

483
00:21:38,919 --> 00:21:40,510
just kind of mind-blowing we didn't have

484
00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:45,399
any of those things back then and these

485
00:21:45,399 --> 00:21:49,149
days we have so much tooling dev tooling

486
00:21:49,149 --> 00:21:51,520
to make our lives even easier right to

487
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:54,100
ensure that we're not shipping broken

488
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:57,070
code because in the past like I said we

489
00:21:57,070 --> 00:21:59,080
had our desktop computer you made the

490
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:01,720
changes and then you just FTP that you

491
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:02,440
just put it

492
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:05,590
the server right and we basically were

493
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:08,080
working directly on the server and would

494
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:10,090
always break all sorts of things like

495
00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:13,080
one dangling comma would just completely

496
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:16,600
destroy the site but now our code goes

497
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:19,090
like on this incredible journey before

498
00:22:19,090 --> 00:22:21,460
it even gets to production right like we

499
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:23,889
have editors like vs code that make

500
00:22:23,889 --> 00:22:25,750
writing code so much easier because it

501
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:27,940
has a tell isense and it can warn you

502
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:30,730
for typos and selectors all these

503
00:22:30,730 --> 00:22:33,340
extensions that make a coding easier and

504
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:36,220
we have github which is like table

505
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:42,490
sticks now like having via github but we

506
00:22:42,490 --> 00:22:44,350
didn't have version control back then or

507
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:46,059
at least only the big companies had

508
00:22:46,059 --> 00:22:49,179
version control and imagine like two

509
00:22:49,179 --> 00:22:51,039
people trying to work on the same

510
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:53,860
project FTP and Co just directly onto a

511
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:56,710
site like it's just madness how we were

512
00:22:56,710 --> 00:22:59,200
able to make all that stuff run and then

513
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,450
there's of course there's gulp right and

514
00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:03,370
I've labeled us to write build scripts

515
00:23:03,370 --> 00:23:05,700
to transform our SAS and to minified

516
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:10,269
optimize CSS like I remember having to

517
00:23:10,269 --> 00:23:14,019
write terse CSS with like no spaces all

518
00:23:14,019 --> 00:23:16,090
on one line in order to make sure that

519
00:23:16,090 --> 00:23:19,240
my CSS was as small as possible because

520
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:20,769
we didn't have other things like

521
00:23:20,769 --> 00:23:25,389
minifiers to to change our CSS I had a

522
00:23:25,389 --> 00:23:25,899
friend

523
00:23:25,899 --> 00:23:27,639
actually who was working at AOL at the

524
00:23:27,639 --> 00:23:29,440
same time and they weren't allowed to

525
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,720
write any comments and any of their CSS

526
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:33,490
and any of their JavaScript because it

527
00:23:33,490 --> 00:23:35,740
would make the CSS even bigger like

528
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:38,799
nothing just write the code and then

529
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:40,419
we've got Travis of course that gives

530
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:42,879
continuous integration environment so we

531
00:23:42,879 --> 00:23:45,610
can automatically kick off builds with

532
00:23:45,610 --> 00:23:48,039
git commits and they could run tests and

533
00:23:48,039 --> 00:23:51,009
even deploy automatically to production

534
00:23:51,009 --> 00:23:53,559
and we have services like net laugh I

535
00:23:53,559 --> 00:23:56,500
that even allow us to preview our PRS

536
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:59,080
now even before they're merged so we can

537
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:01,059
see what this CSS has done we can see

538
00:24:01,059 --> 00:24:03,210
what the JavaScript is done even before

539
00:24:03,210 --> 00:24:08,629
it lands and even before we merge it in

540
00:24:08,639 --> 00:24:12,970
so um quick question actually before I

541
00:24:12,970 --> 00:24:15,460
finish another question how many people

542
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:18,190
here have been in the industry been

543
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:20,860
developing for two years or less can you

544
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:22,240
raise your hand for two years or less

545
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:24,610
okay yeah we got a good a number of

546
00:24:24,610 --> 00:24:27,519
people here that's awesome

547
00:24:27,519 --> 00:24:29,769
like I was I was very fortunate to be

548
00:24:29,769 --> 00:24:31,899
exposed to software development like

549
00:24:31,899 --> 00:24:33,309
when I was 15 years old

550
00:24:33,309 --> 00:24:36,220
like that's now I'm definitely my whole

551
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:38,110
career and my whole life has been

552
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:41,049
changed because of that fact right but

553
00:24:41,049 --> 00:24:42,759
it's great that those of you who are

554
00:24:42,759 --> 00:24:45,669
just starting are here and you're here

555
00:24:45,669 --> 00:24:48,250
wanting to learn because early on

556
00:24:48,250 --> 00:24:50,470
conferences like these were few and far

557
00:24:50,470 --> 00:24:54,159
between but most new developers they

558
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:55,869
have you know what's called impostor

559
00:24:55,869 --> 00:24:58,059
syndrome where they feel like they don't

560
00:24:58,059 --> 00:25:01,480
belong because now the bar for what's

561
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:04,539
minimally valuable to be a real

562
00:25:04,539 --> 00:25:06,369
developer is higher and higher and

563
00:25:06,369 --> 00:25:07,659
higher you have to know all these

564
00:25:07,659 --> 00:25:09,850
different tools in order to to build

565
00:25:09,850 --> 00:25:12,429
websites and it's easy for folks just

566
00:25:12,429 --> 00:25:14,440
getting started to not feel like they

567
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:16,210
belong and then you can come to a

568
00:25:16,210 --> 00:25:18,220
conference like this and hear about even

569
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:19,929
more things that you don't know and your

570
00:25:19,929 --> 00:25:21,639
impostor syndrome can actually get even

571
00:25:21,639 --> 00:25:25,809
worse right and and then you have people

572
00:25:25,809 --> 00:25:27,129
who've been in the industry for a while

573
00:25:27,129 --> 00:25:30,460
now who have successfully made it

574
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:32,830
through the gate right they made it

575
00:25:32,830 --> 00:25:33,970
through the gate they know how to do

576
00:25:33,970 --> 00:25:36,190
software development and now they're

577
00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:37,720
they're blocking the gate being

578
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:39,549
gatekeepers preventing other people from

579
00:25:39,549 --> 00:25:42,039
going in unless they learn the way that

580
00:25:42,039 --> 00:25:43,840
they learn right they have to go through

581
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,309
the hardships that they went through

582
00:25:45,309 --> 00:25:47,230
they have to know how the old code

583
00:25:47,230 --> 00:25:49,330
worked before the new code works right

584
00:25:49,330 --> 00:25:51,789
and you know what I just don't believe

585
00:25:51,789 --> 00:25:52,809
that that's the way that it should be

586
00:25:52,809 --> 00:25:56,710
right we should I want to encourage you

587
00:25:56,710 --> 00:25:58,720
those who are just getting started

588
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,610
that don't stress about it right just

589
00:26:00,610 --> 00:26:02,110
learn what you want to learn

590
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:04,419
enjoy it like you're not less than

591
00:26:04,419 --> 00:26:07,149
you're not subpar there are many

592
00:26:07,149 --> 00:26:08,919
different ways to learn you can start by

593
00:26:08,919 --> 00:26:10,419
building an app and then learn how the

594
00:26:10,419 --> 00:26:13,360
details work like I know many people who

595
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:15,610
come from boot camps who've only got

596
00:26:15,610 --> 00:26:16,119
learned

597
00:26:16,119 --> 00:26:18,429
taken schooling for three months or six

598
00:26:18,429 --> 00:26:20,559
months we're able to do amazing amazing

599
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:21,549
work more than people

600
00:26:21,549 --> 00:26:22,230
who

601
00:26:22,230 --> 00:26:25,830
had a traditional degree okay so even if

602
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:28,650
you just graduated yesterday right you

603
00:26:28,650 --> 00:26:30,540
can be an integral part of this

604
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:32,220
community I want to encourage you that

605
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:34,320
like you can be as integral as somebody

606
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:35,669
who's been doing it for twenty years

607
00:26:35,669 --> 00:26:39,000
plus so to sum it up you've got this

608
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:48,210
okay

609
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:51,100
so that's it just wanted to wrap it up I

610
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:53,830
wanted to thank the organizers of CSS

611
00:26:53,830 --> 00:26:56,350
coffee you for inviting me to come and

612
00:26:56,350 --> 00:26:58,480
speak and putting on such like a

613
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:01,419
welcoming and inclusive conference like

614
00:27:01,419 --> 00:27:03,610
there's closed captioning here for those

615
00:27:03,610 --> 00:27:05,590
folks who need it there's childcare for

616
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:07,960
folks who need it like it's amazing so I

617
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,549
want to take time for all of us

618
00:27:09,549 --> 00:27:11,740
to thank them for putting on the

619
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:12,970
conference we give them a round of

620
00:27:12,970 --> 00:27:16,690
applause thank you so much thank you

621
00:27:16,690 --> 00:27:22,990
thank you and thank you all everyone as

622
00:27:22,990 --> 00:27:25,419
well I hope you enjoy kind of the ride

623
00:27:25,419 --> 00:27:27,700
on this wayback machine

624
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:29,169
hopefully it gives all of us an

625
00:27:29,169 --> 00:27:31,299
appreciation for how far we've come how

626
00:27:31,299 --> 00:27:33,820
bad it was I guess in the beginning and

627
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:35,710
the next time you want to complain about

628
00:27:35,710 --> 00:27:37,629
not having something in our browser just

629
00:27:37,629 --> 00:27:39,879
imagine having to write framesets all

630
00:27:39,879 --> 00:27:41,320
the time and then it'll make you feel a

631
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:43,870
lot better okay so if you have any

632
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:46,059
questions for me just feel free to reach

633
00:27:46,059 --> 00:27:48,370

[Applause]
