1
00:00:05,090 --> 00:00:07,790

just a quick content warning this talk

2
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:09,800
mentions open ography and chopra graffia

3
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:13,190
in the fifth part so anyway this is a

4
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:14,480
story of

5
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,580
J spin I've given one talked before

6
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:18,050
about Jay has been and how it went from

7
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:22,070
PHP to to know it was a cool story and I

8
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:24,980
was high-fiving myself fish thing this

9
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:27,230
is the b-side this is the the bad

10
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:30,500
stories and everything I share with you

11
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:32,509
today Jo spin is the longest-running

12
00:00:32,509 --> 00:00:36,559
live paste bin it's it won't it's not

13
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:38,000
going anywhere and will continue to

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,269
serve its users including the scumbags

15
00:00:40,269 --> 00:00:42,860
so I've broken this up into five

16
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:45,710
sections just to touch on each kind of

17
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:49,789
area that kind of focus into so denial

18
00:00:49,789 --> 00:00:52,190
of service different types of spam that

19
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:55,609
i found on j spin havoc from my own

20
00:00:55,609 --> 00:00:58,879
registered users the costs of running j

21
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:02,809
spin and a few incidents that were the

22
00:01:02,809 --> 00:01:06,530
police yeah so just a very brief

23
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:09,020
backstory Jay's been originally was a

24
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:13,009
four-hour PHP hack it was out of my

25
00:01:13,009 --> 00:01:18,140
bedroom office and it was 2008

26
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:19,399
September's he doesn't eat it was

27
00:01:19,399 --> 00:01:21,679
released it was the first to suffer any

28
00:01:21,679 --> 00:01:24,140
real abuse I know jsfiddle was offered

29
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:25,580
quite a bit of abuse in the last couple

30
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:27,649
of years I'm not sure if Co pen has so

31
00:01:27,649 --> 00:01:29,569
much in terms of kind of you know people

32
00:01:29,569 --> 00:01:32,720
websites in the same space so this is

33
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:36,229
not a particularly happy story it's left

34
00:01:36,229 --> 00:01:37,849
me with a bit of a toxic taste in my

35
00:01:37,849 --> 00:01:40,330
mouth for the the open source project

36
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:43,310
please bear in mind i am the solstice

37
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:45,380
admin for this project my knowledge is

38
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:49,039
limited there are no you know big load

39
00:01:49,039 --> 00:01:52,340
balancer servers my pockets are not

40
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:54,950
infinitely deep with cash there's no

41
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:59,390
central machines it's just me so do I

42
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:04,580
service so this is what denial of

43
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:06,979
service looks like four J's bin and

44
00:02:06,979 --> 00:02:08,569
there's there's different forms like

45
00:02:08,569 --> 00:02:11,120
they're not generally trying to attack

46
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,270
jsb in the the users but this is what

47
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:16,489
happens when node Goes Down and engine X

48
00:02:16,489 --> 00:02:18,610
is the front you get to see this page

49
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:21,890
and like so there's different types of

50
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:24,680
attacks that I've seen and one of the

51
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,000
one of the popular ones is the self

52
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:26,910
attack by

53
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:29,160
the the morons so script kiddies are

54
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:31,860
basically taking their there you know

55
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:34,920
copy and paste HTML and Java scripts me

56
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:38,370
put it into J's bin and the idea is you

57
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:41,340
point it to a domain like Jas comp and

58
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:44,070
you hit go and it launches like a

59
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:45,810
thousand xhr requests or a thousand

60
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:47,160
image requests and it just you know all

61
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:50,040
attacks at once the April May is being

62
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,210
script kiddies they've copied and pasted

63
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:52,440
I only thought about what they're doing

64
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:56,250
so they forget to type HTTP / / J's bin

65
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:59,790
je s conf put us and they type just jazz

66
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:02,820
comp us there's no validation the hit go

67
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:08,970
and it attacks HTTP Jess been calm /url

68
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:12,210
/ Jess comptia us goes through the full

69
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:14,400
subsystem of jet fjs been looking for

70
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,590
the bin with that name and it comes back

71
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:18,810
saying no it's not here and they just

72
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:21,390
hammer the out J has been and you

73
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:23,280
know I end up with this which is which

74
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:29,100
is cool and generally I mean I'm based

75
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:33,420
in the UK most of my my script kiddie

76
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:35,340
friends are in the US so I tend to wake

77
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,740
up to this so you know Twitter being a

78
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:39,720
metric for you know how queer products

79
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:43,170
is it is jasmine's down you where

80
00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:46,280
there's SS problem five or four errors

81
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,900
just over and over again now some of

82
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:50,370
this actually comes from the Status page

83
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:51,840
they're just kind of clicking on the

84
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,910
link and it says tweet me if you think

85
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:56,280
it's down this is the kind of love I

86
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:59,370
getting in Twitter which kind of sucks

87
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:00,780
to wake up to this first thing in the

88
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:04,020
morning and i do have run books for this

89
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:07,440
kind of thing so i use cloud watch on

90
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:10,560
AWS to tell me when the cpu is high but

91
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,209
when it's happening a lot it's kind of

92
00:04:12,209 --> 00:04:14,280
like the alert that you just eventually

93
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,989
just ignore you like yeah it's high

94
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:20,000
again and one night it got so bad that

95
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,800
so what I normally do is I go the run

96
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,770
book tells me to look the the engine

97
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:28,710
text logs and like take the last 200

98
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:31,020
lines and find me the unique IPS and

99
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:32,760
gimmick count those ip's and if there's

100
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,350
one there's only one it has like three

101
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:36,360
hundred quests and last couple of

102
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,740
seconds and a restaurant normal numbers

103
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:39,940
so I'll just IP table block that I

104
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:42,370
and one evening it was just going

105
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:44,220
bananas and I was just getting I

106
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:45,760
constantly different IP addresses

107
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,470
turning up in this big range of kind of

108
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:51,850
a requests so I was like this is 10pm

109
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:54,180
I've kids so that's kind of my bedtime

110
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:58,030
and so I wrote cron job that would just

111
00:04:58,030 --> 00:05:01,180
repeatedly look at the logs and just

112
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:03,430
keep IP table block at blacklisting

113
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:06,490
these IP addresses and a head off the

114
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:08,370
bed kind of like this will be alright

115
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:12,340
and woke up to pretty much everyone

116
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:15,070
using Jer spin has been blocked but the

117
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:20,530
server was fine again which is good yes

118
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:24,130
I got real the cron job and yeah a lot

119
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:25,210
of people kind of got hit in the

120
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:27,700
crossfire it did calm down it on a war

121
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:29,980
caused it but eventually discovered a

122
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:33,040
fail to ban like I found this about two

123
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,840
years ago now I think so fail2ban

124
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,970
basically does the same kind of thing

125
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:38,500
but is a lit we're more intelligent

126
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:41,200
about it so it'll jail the IP address of

127
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:44,200
five minutes and stop them from

128
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,630
basically heading the the node server

129
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:48,910
which is good the only problem is it

130
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:52,020
then catches workshops and like when

131
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:54,610
teachers of state teaching students and

132
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:55,690
I workshop they're all coming from the

133
00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:58,330
same IP address and they get hit by this

134
00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:01,750
this belt ban so like people trying to

135
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:03,160
learn inside the classroom environment

136
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,900
get caught by this thing I've had to

137
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:07,990
create I can whitelist people but they

138
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:09,010
have to know that they've been

139
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:10,330
blacklisted in the first place

140
00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:12,580
automatically I've had people send me

141
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:14,790
tweets just like Jasmine of shits down

142
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:17,919
like that get I get sense that you're

143
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:19,480
all coming from the same classroom maybe

144
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,280
start with is there a problem with Jay

145
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,220
has been rather than just saying it

146
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:25,540
and then I whitelist them and that you

147
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:30,220
know that less angry at me yeah that's

148
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:32,050
one of the the fun bit server chespin

149
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:36,850
and who doesn't love a filthy amount

150
00:06:36,850 --> 00:06:39,730
spam in their products so Jay has been

151
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:43,240
what it is exactly is a website that

152
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,370
people can anonymously create anything

153
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:50,500
they want so yeah it's basically I was

154
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,600
asking for trouble alright so

155
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:59,140
Jeff spin as of say April 2015 yeah as

156
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:02,410
of April 2015 this year had well over 15

157
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:06,310
million bins and I looked at a few

158
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:07,870
minutes ago actually it's 21 million in

159
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:11,200
there now and across 10 million bins in

160
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:16,960
2014 so it took like five years or six

161
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,400
years to get to 10 million but I got a

162
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:22,090
15 million a year later I should have

163
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:23,950
twigged that something was up like

164
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:26,110
having gotten fifty percent more content

165
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:32,200
in the database in a year and I mean

166
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,120
maybe that's growth hacking but I don't

167
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,460
think there's yeah there's definitely

168
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:39,490
span going on so I have different types

169
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:41,950
of spam lots of different types of spam

170
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:45,340
i have like affiliate spam SEO spam i'm

171
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:47,760
just going to work a couple of them

172
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:50,830
fishing was the first kind of the real

173
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:53,200
first kind of abuse that I ever found in

174
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:57,550
Jay spin and if you actually look at the

175
00:07:57,550 --> 00:07:59,620
source code for a spin in github you'll

176
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:02,010
see that the config says it's blocking

177
00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:04,720
habbo com so someone had taken the login

178
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:08,080
page Harbor com put on a spin and so if

179
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,460
anyone remembers having a calm is like a

180
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:12,220
nice more thick game from the other node

181
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:13,570
two thousand mid-2000 something like

182
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:18,910
that and it they put the login page

183
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:20,860
there so I got an email saying someone's

184
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:23,800
fishing the logins even though like it

185
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,690
says chance been in url you'd think that

186
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:27,760
people would see this but apparently

187
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:30,130
they don't and the code today that

188
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:31,780
Sanjay has been it currently blacklists

189
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:34,990
habit or common and I think the process

190
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:36,669
formed what CGI a like the old thing for

191
00:08:36,669 --> 00:08:39,700
capturing data and there's there's

192
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:42,490
simple blacklisting tech inside a JSP I

193
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:44,050
have a private config that's not in

194
00:08:44,050 --> 00:08:46,200
github that blocks a whole lot of things

195
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:49,600
things like clickbank and random bits

196
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,240
and Narcy code kim kardashian spelt

197
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,870
wrong consistently wrong Kardashian some

198
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:58,630
of that there's a lot of spam with her

199
00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:02,470
name in it so it but it's a whack-a-mole

200
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:05,200
situation like you you be blacklist one

201
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,250
thing and then

202
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:07,960
a tweak the spam a bit more and it just

203
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:11,530
starts appearing again the biggest kind

204
00:09:11,530 --> 00:09:12,610
of spam the biggest problem actually

205
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:15,700
turn out to be linked hiding so this

206
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:18,490
would be where I want to get you to my

207
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:21,550
ass hat website so i run a skeptic calm

208
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:26,410
and i sell bad stuff and i put the links

209
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:27,730
out on social media networks like

210
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:30,310
Twitter and Facebook and you end up

211
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:31,780
going to this website like oh no it's

212
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:33,730
bad so Twitter and Facebook get savvy to

213
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:36,040
this and they block any links to ours

214
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:39,280
hat com so like okay you know what gonna

215
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,900
put inside a bit ly and I'm gonna put

216
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:44,110
bitly link inside of twitter com and

217
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:46,030
your bounced and hit bit be and go off

218
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:48,580
to our SATCOM but now Twitter or

219
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:50,440
following redirects so they can trace

220
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:53,320
the redirect down and see that i'm still

221
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:57,880
linking through to our SATCOM so they

222
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:00,310
take j spin and they do window dot top

223
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:03,190
location or window de location equals us

224
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:06,370
out so calm and they put j spin in

225
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:09,310
twitter and there's no like you know

226
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:11,530
header redirect so you get redirected

227
00:10:11,530 --> 00:10:15,130
off to at the bad website and there are

228
00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:16,839
a hundred different ways to do a

229
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:18,460
redirect in javascript it's like you

230
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:21,100
know window dot location equals top

231
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:23,980
delegation equals top square bracket loc

232
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:26,560
plus okay occasion like that I can't

233
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,750
black list it's just impossible short of

234
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:30,940
I don't know I don't know how to there's

235
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:34,120
no way blacklisting at all to the point

236
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,380
where eventually Facebook were just like

237
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:38,260
yep we blocked jasmine so I was breeding

238
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:40,540
blog post about how jet Jasmine was

239
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:42,880
being used for some react demos having

240
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,010
known that Jer spins completely blocked

241
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:47,020
in like those posts or coming out of

242
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:50,380
Facebook having Facebook blocking Jay

243
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:52,570
has been the same time now they've

244
00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:54,790
stopped blocking Jeff spin but them yeah

245
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:56,860
basically was being abused so and and

246
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:58,360
the thing is with the redirect it it

247
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,950
doesn't happen when you're inside of the

248
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:01,480
chair spin window only happens when you

249
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:06,160
get rid of the editor so I had to like

250
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,890
limit the ability to create an anonymous

251
00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:12,520
bins like what it what it does so if you

252
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:15,220
are not signed in to Jay I spin when you

253
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:17,110
look at the full output it can still do

254
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:18,520
that rewrite but it'll only do it for 90

255
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:19,180
minutes

256
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:22,540
after you your last save so when they

257
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:24,520
you know they put those links into

258
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:27,210
Twitter or Facebook eventually they

259
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:29,650
expire this that 19 minutes and it goes

260
00:11:29,650 --> 00:11:32,410
inside of the chair spin editor and the

261
00:11:32,410 --> 00:11:34,150
redirect doesn't work because it's in an

262
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:36,400
iframe that has a sandbox property that

263
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,470
doesn't allow you to a redirect but it

264
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:40,210
means now that I've limited this

265
00:11:40,210 --> 00:11:41,560
anonymous functionality in the free

266
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:43,930
functionality that I offered to to users

267
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:46,810
because of people just abusing J spin

268
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:48,460
but at least I kind of solved that

269
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:57,350
problem and the anonymous users abusers

270
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:06,100
it instead so yeah riginal EJ has been

271
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:09,220
the very first version had no sign in no

272
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:10,360
concept of accounts or anything with

273
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,860
that it was a hundred percent anonymous

274
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:14,890
I wanted it be I try for a very long

275
00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:18,280
time to keep it like that and I didn't

276
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,510
want user accounts I thought it was cool

277
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:20,770
that you could just kind of go up there

278
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:22,600
do a thing walk away from it it was lost

279
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:25,120
forever and that lost forever was a

280
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,590
problem because eventually people coming

281
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:28,720
back saying yeah I make like 30 pins on

282
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,760
jasmine and where are they how do I get

283
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:32,710
them back like there's no user counselor

284
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:34,630
yeah no I want the back though I want to

285
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:37,450
be able to find them again so there was

286
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:39,550
a complete refactor from PHP to nose in

287
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:42,730
that refactor version 3 or very clean

288
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:44,130
but we also added user account

289
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:46,750
registration password reminder so you

290
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:49,590
can actually get those those bins back

291
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:51,910
there's just one floor there was zero

292
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:54,820
checks on the account like I don't like

293
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:57,460
captures so I didn't put one there and I

294
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:59,290
don't like the email authentication loop

295
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:01,630
so I didn't put that there either which

296
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:04,180
means that you can literally just say my

297
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:07,120
username is a if actually we have a user

298
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,880
with the username space so you can have

299
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:10,960
a space for your username and your

300
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,550
password can be a space if you choose

301
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:17,410
just possible to his place so yeah my um

302
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:20,560
my registrations went up and unbeknownst

303
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:24,970
to me yeah my my users were going up and

304
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:29,230
I hadn't noticed basically until this

305
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:32,050
day so this is the day that everything

306
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:32,950
round two

307
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:37,420
at almost a 100 percent halt so it's

308
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:41,970
March 2015 this year I'm solo parenting

309
00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:47,260
my wife my daughter being born earlier

310
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:50,740
on that year yeah she's like almost one

311
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:52,360
at this point my wife has never gone out

312
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:54,910
by herself like this is the first time

313
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:56,770
that you I like she's gone out by but

314
00:13:56,770 --> 00:13:59,200
like for the day so i'm i'm babysitting

315
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,090
babysit I'm solar parenting for the day

316
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:02,800
for the first time since she gave birth

317
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:06,310
to a daughter so like it's a big deal to

318
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:08,290
her that I don't kind of go yeah can you

319
00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:13,990
come back because Jasmine's broken see

320
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:15,550
ya that morning I woke up and people who

321
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:17,110
have sending me tweets as they do about

322
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:18,190
Jay has been there was you know

323
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:20,140
something's on something it wasn't the

324
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:21,760
fibro force but something was off it

325
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:24,880
wasn't quite working the way they wanted

326
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:28,000
it to like saving didn't seem to work

327
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,850
and I had a chance to have a look at it

328
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:34,390
and I mentioned the bins had gone up

329
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:37,540
they've gone up from 10 million to 15

330
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:40,660
million at quite a rate a storage is

331
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:43,030
pretty cheap right so jess pins database

332
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:47,020
is completely isolated on one ABS drive

333
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:50,590
and it's 100 gig and all it stores is

334
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:52,930
like text HTML CSS JavaScript and a bit

335
00:14:52,930 --> 00:14:56,160
of metadata that hundred gig at all gone

336
00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:00,160
by completely empty and I managed to

337
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,290
jump on the server and try and delete

338
00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:06,340
some rows of data but in in writing an

339
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:08,350
SQL query to delete rows of data at

340
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:10,330
nasik like create a temporary table to

341
00:15:10,330 --> 00:15:13,420
be able to work out what rose to delete

342
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:16,510
I by the time I delete rows more data

343
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:18,010
came in filling the remaining space

344
00:15:18,010 --> 00:15:20,050
until I had 0 bytes left it couldn't I

345
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:22,540
couldn't run the query to delete rows

346
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:24,400
from the database like ran out of space

347
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:29,550
entirely there was zero bytes left and

348
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:32,410
the thing is it's like I'm I'm so

349
00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:34,960
apparently and I feel this

350
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:37,360
responsibility to to J's bin and the

351
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,670
users who aren't paying me for it like

352
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:42,760
it's just a service that's there and you

353
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:44,500
just have to I just had two basic say

354
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,300
okay close laptop

355
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:48,940
so it's not going to fix itself but it

356
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:50,890
will have to stay broken and Jasmine was

357
00:15:50,890 --> 00:15:52,270
still low like you can still bring

358
00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:53,950
things up and see your data you just

359
00:15:53,950 --> 00:15:56,230
couldn't save anything and I just had to

360
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:58,660
focus on my kids until my wife came home

361
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:01,870
I was like can I get just quickly grab

362
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:05,140
the computer and increase the displaced

363
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:07,600
from 100 Gig to 400 geek I did manage to

364
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,910
get a github issue up saying please help

365
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:11,620
describe the situation but the bottom

366
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:14,290
line is like the actual drive on a DBS

367
00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:16,780
had to be changed and no one could do

368
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:19,210
that for me that no no amount debugging

369
00:16:19,210 --> 00:16:21,870
would have fixed that problem so

370
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:26,890
upgraded to a 400 gig drive that's

371
00:16:26,890 --> 00:16:28,270
enough space for a while right I've

372
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:32,510
another a year until this happens again

373
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:36,460
but the downside is I had to close the

374
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:40,290
like free sign in process so I had

375
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:43,090
register with your email and password or

376
00:16:43,090 --> 00:16:46,300
use github and now you can only use

377
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:49,120
github to get into jf in which is

378
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,130
totally reasonable for you know this

379
00:16:51,130 --> 00:16:53,230
kind of audience like I'm sure most of

380
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:54,850
you have a github account and it's not

381
00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:56,260
problem just click the button and you're

382
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:58,120
you're in but a classroom full of

383
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:00,550
students or you know kids they won't

384
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:01,900
have a github account and I've closed

385
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:04,780
the door on them now which kind of bums

386
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:08,200
me out because it was supposed to be you

387
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:12,880
know free but making it completely

388
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,590
anonymous is ultimately a stupid idea

389
00:17:14,590 --> 00:17:18,460
like it ends up you know getting abused

390
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:19,690
and this kind of thing happening

391
00:17:19,690 --> 00:17:27,280
basically so in 2014 I was doing a lot

392
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,020
of traveling and going to lock

393
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:32,290
conferences and I think I was here what

394
00:17:32,290 --> 00:17:35,470
year is it 2015 2013 no 2013 2013 i was

395
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:38,110
doing traveling i was here and I spoke

396
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:40,090
to other people that spelling people

397
00:17:40,090 --> 00:17:41,410
during the conference and other

398
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:43,060
conferences and had a lot of people

399
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:44,590
saying how we give you money for ji spin

400
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:46,750
I was like no no no Jasmine's free I

401
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:49,210
don't money this is stupid by the way

402
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:50,260
people say you want to give you money

403
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:52,450
take money and

404
00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:57,110
yeah I up to that point I've been

405
00:17:57,110 --> 00:18:00,890
working on it since 2008 entirely all my

406
00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:03,230
development a friend of mine Danny hope

407
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:04,789
had been doing the UX on the website

408
00:18:04,789 --> 00:18:08,780
since 2009 and the more people I met

409
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:11,390
that said they wanted somehow support

410
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:13,669
the project I realized that there was an

411
00:18:13,669 --> 00:18:17,210
opportunity to try and add profi like a

412
00:18:17,210 --> 00:18:18,919
pro account and make it try and make it

413
00:18:18,919 --> 00:18:21,890
self sustaining so the beginning of 2014

414
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:25,370
I hired to developers to work full-time

415
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:27,380
on Jo spinning clear and then added

416
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:29,120
myself to welcome Jeff in full time and

417
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,580
I would create the pro offering of

418
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:38,480
Jeff's been so the end of yes the end of

419
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:44,870
it launched in May 2014 or may or may

420
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:49,100
july or some middle of the year and the

421
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:53,960
income from the pro subscriptions just

422
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:56,030
about covers the operating costs of the

423
00:18:56,030 --> 00:19:00,650
servers so i am not doing scrooge mcduck

424
00:19:00,650 --> 00:19:03,080
nose dives into piles of cash and if

425
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:05,030
anyone doesn't know who that is go

426
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:06,260
google it you can watch some screws

427
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:10,610
McDuck but the upside is before pro

428
00:19:10,610 --> 00:19:11,990
chair swing was making a hundred percent

429
00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:14,450
loss now it's just not making hundreds

430
00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:16,400
in Los I'm just not making any good

431
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,360
money from it so that's kind of good

432
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:22,520
there was also a huge cost to taking

433
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:25,880
money through a cycle VAT moss which I

434
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:28,909
can run about for ages which is why I've

435
00:19:28,909 --> 00:19:31,070
taken it out of this talk but it's a

436
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:34,340
European legislation thing which i'll

437
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:35,960
happily talk to anyone about in the bar

438
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:38,270
for about an hour because it makes me

439
00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:42,970
angry but there were other costs to two

440
00:19:42,970 --> 00:19:46,429
chairs been like it turns out i actually

441
00:19:46,429 --> 00:19:48,590
created a website for testing stolen

442
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:52,130
credit cards didn't realize but um yeah

443
00:19:52,130 --> 00:19:55,370
because the pro accounts was initially

444
00:19:55,370 --> 00:19:59,480
so cheap it meant that you could take a

445
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:01,909
stolen credit card and test that stolen

446
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:04,340
credit card in jay has been because the

447
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:05,799
the cost is so low dozen

448
00:20:05,799 --> 00:20:07,960
set up a red flag there goes through

449
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,700
like yeah I've got a stolen card that

450
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:11,379
works so i can go ahead and you know use

451
00:20:11,379 --> 00:20:15,369
it for more transactions yeah so Joe has

452
00:20:15,369 --> 00:20:18,009
been being used as a test bed for stolen

453
00:20:18,009 --> 00:20:21,429
credit cards I would be like yay new pro

454
00:20:21,429 --> 00:20:23,919
user and they'll be like yeah this card

455
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:28,739
works going by TV and then eventually

456
00:20:28,739 --> 00:20:31,330
the owner of the card will get like work

457
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:33,039
out what's this Jer spending on my

458
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:34,119
account I mean it should produce about

459
00:20:34,119 --> 00:20:36,850
the TV but they they get in touch with a

460
00:20:36,850 --> 00:20:39,279
bank and I say I didn't buy this I would

461
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:40,690
like it kind of refunded and they have

462
00:20:40,690 --> 00:20:42,460
protections so the bank gets in touch

463
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:44,259
with stripe and stripes say we have a

464
00:20:44,259 --> 00:20:47,590
dispute on this this account and I look

465
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:48,730
at the account I'm like oh yeah they

466
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:51,129
made like one bin yeah that looks like a

467
00:20:51,129 --> 00:20:52,899
stolen here's your money back like no no

468
00:20:52,899 --> 00:20:56,200
no we need money back and because you

469
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:59,559
lost the dispute you have to pay 15

470
00:20:59,559 --> 00:21:04,029
pound 34 so for the refund for a stolen

471
00:21:04,029 --> 00:21:06,129
to test the stolen card success and be

472
00:21:06,129 --> 00:21:10,139
successful it cost me 21 pounds so like

473
00:21:10,139 --> 00:21:12,879
twenty eight dollars twenty thirty

474
00:21:12,879 --> 00:21:15,399
dollars something dollars but like money

475
00:21:15,399 --> 00:21:18,070
it costing me money for people to test

476
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:19,840
their credit cards and successes like

477
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:23,139
succeed stolen solid credit card so

478
00:21:23,139 --> 00:21:25,119
there's there's that's not a business

479
00:21:25,119 --> 00:21:26,769
but it's like a negative business there

480
00:21:26,769 --> 00:21:30,309
right and Stripes pretty good at

481
00:21:30,309 --> 00:21:32,799
catching some of the stuff but still

482
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:35,080
there are some stolen cars to get

483
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:36,639
through basically and there's no there's

484
00:21:36,639 --> 00:21:38,739
no avoiding it so i have a new process

485
00:21:38,739 --> 00:21:41,289
which is every single pro user that

486
00:21:41,289 --> 00:21:42,909
comes through and it's it's not a lot

487
00:21:42,909 --> 00:21:44,769
like there's one every day or every

488
00:21:44,769 --> 00:21:46,989
other day and I go in and I look at

489
00:21:46,989 --> 00:21:48,580
their account and if they have some bit

490
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:50,739
like some bins with like react

491
00:21:50,739 --> 00:21:52,809
surrounded or whatever they choose to do

492
00:21:52,809 --> 00:21:55,690
I'm like okay that seems legit and I got

493
00:21:55,690 --> 00:21:59,230
one recently I think that part they use

494
00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:02,169
name was like anti security and there

495
00:22:02,169 --> 00:22:05,309
was one bin which was just it was

496
00:22:05,309 --> 00:22:08,259
obviously i think was like a script

497
00:22:08,259 --> 00:22:10,690
kiddie style thing and looks at the

498
00:22:10,690 --> 00:22:11,980
credit card the credit card was from

499
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:14,169
russia but they were based in america so

500
00:22:14,169 --> 00:22:15,730
like you know what I'm just going to

501
00:22:15,730 --> 00:22:17,919
refund you and Mark that's possibly

502
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:19,750
fraudulent and I did

503
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:23,500
get fined so ya caught 11 stolen credit

504
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:33,130
card he gave me yeah so when I was

505
00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:35,560
meeting these people saying like we want

506
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:37,990
to give you money like do you have a pro

507
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:40,570
thing or a donation thing or anything

508
00:22:40,570 --> 00:22:42,670
like that I ran some numbers on the

509
00:22:42,670 --> 00:22:44,970
database looks at the registered users i

510
00:22:44,970 --> 00:22:47,920
factored in like twenty percent Idol

511
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:51,070
spam users having not thought about like

512
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:52,060
you know when they're going to come an

513
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:53,760
attack and just start registering

514
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:56,650
bye-bye bananas going nuts and

515
00:22:56,650 --> 00:22:59,350
restorations but I figured I aim for one

516
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:02,620
percent conversion rate if I get 1% user

517
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:05,050
used to go pro then this would make the

518
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:07,300
project sustain sustaining

519
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:08,920
self-sustaining enough that I could put

520
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,480
at least a full-time developer honor and

521
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,250
I could then kind of get income from

522
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:17,080
client work at the same time that's all

523
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:19,450
I did though there was no business plan

524
00:23:19,450 --> 00:23:21,130
beyond that there was no development

525
00:23:21,130 --> 00:23:22,870
plan there was no marketing plan there

526
00:23:22,870 --> 00:23:24,460
were no deadlines there were no Eames

527
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:25,750
really beyond that I just had kind of

528
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:27,490
looks and when what could we offer for

529
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:30,820
pro a couple of private things and there

530
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:33,490
wasn't there wasn't a great deal more I

531
00:23:33,490 --> 00:23:36,310
mean we looked at teams briefly and we

532
00:23:36,310 --> 00:23:38,110
kind of end up going down the wrong path

533
00:23:38,110 --> 00:23:40,000
and ditched a month's worth of work and

534
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,220
kind of backed up to just try and go for

535
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:44,010
simple and get something that's launched

536
00:23:44,010 --> 00:23:47,440
and it got to the point where I was

537
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,060
chasing the end of the rainbow like I

538
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:51,010
was trying to get that last like five

539
00:23:51,010 --> 00:23:54,580
percent done and like all this work was

540
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:56,590
done I was ready for pro but I just

541
00:23:56,590 --> 00:23:58,810
wanted a polished off the last little

542
00:23:58,810 --> 00:24:00,610
bits of work and it took like well over

543
00:24:00,610 --> 00:24:02,080
a month just to get to that point where

544
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,090
I was happy to kind of turn on and say

545
00:24:04,090 --> 00:24:07,480
yes we can start taking money and it

546
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:11,290
seemed to drag on and all the time that

547
00:24:11,290 --> 00:24:14,710
I'm like investing full time in Jay spin

548
00:24:14,710 --> 00:24:16,600
and I'm putting my own money into paying

549
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:20,560
that my developers well it meant that my

550
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,330
company wasn't making any money from

551
00:24:22,330 --> 00:24:24,040
consultancy so it's basically just money

552
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:27,820
out and no money in so eventually

553
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:31,840
jasmine went pro at july twenty third we

554
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,680
had 42 upgrades in the first

555
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:36,410
week 26 from the first day like I said I

556
00:24:36,410 --> 00:24:38,540
was hardly doing kind of nosedive into

557
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:40,790
cash I was very pleased but those

558
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:46,790
numbers are actually reasonably low so

559
00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:48,890
the bottom line is I needed that there

560
00:24:48,890 --> 00:24:52,670
was no plan asshole if I'd had some kind

561
00:24:52,670 --> 00:24:53,720
of business development plan I think

562
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:55,040
things would have gone differently I

563
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,360
mean Jasmine gets a decent amount of

564
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:58,010
traffic there's still something that's

565
00:24:58,010 --> 00:24:59,450
monetizable there I just don't know what

566
00:24:59,450 --> 00:25:04,310
it is and once it gone live as soon as I

567
00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:06,490
would think about new features or

568
00:25:06,490 --> 00:25:09,200
significant changes the Jay has been had

569
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,900
to be justified I I couldn't do that

570
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:15,890
work without if it couldn't justify the

571
00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:19,520
cost of the work on Jeff's been then I

572
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,650
couldn't do it because did it get me

573
00:25:21,650 --> 00:25:24,440
more like paying users did it just add

574
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:28,100
cost to the server ID it it kind of left

575
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:32,480
me feeling like I had to IIE I didn't

576
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,730
like kind of being tied to has been this

577
00:25:34,730 --> 00:25:37,160
way it wasn't fun anymore basically and

578
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:39,950
one of the other biggest problems I had

579
00:25:39,950 --> 00:25:42,920
was that Jasmine gave everything away

580
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:45,320
for free start off with like we had when

581
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:47,510
copan launched we had four of their six

582
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:50,980
Pro features as free and open-source

583
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:54,140
features in Jay has been like like live

584
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:56,030
reload and co casting all this office is

585
00:25:56,030 --> 00:26:00,710
free it still is free but I pay for my

586
00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:03,110
github account because they need private

587
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:05,030
repos I pay for my google account

588
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:07,370
because I needed the space I pay for

589
00:26:07,370 --> 00:26:09,170
dropbox because I needed the space as

590
00:26:09,170 --> 00:26:10,370
soon as I put the word need in the

591
00:26:10,370 --> 00:26:12,350
sentence I realized that I'm willing to

592
00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:14,630
hand over money and with Jay has been I

593
00:26:14,630 --> 00:26:16,850
couldn't even say I needed anything that

594
00:26:16,850 --> 00:26:19,400
was offered by the Pro features so if I

595
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:20,960
can't get to the point where I need

596
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,910
something in Jay has been I found it

597
00:26:22,910 --> 00:26:24,170
hard to see why people just start

598
00:26:24,170 --> 00:26:27,590
throwing money at me you know so as much

599
00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:29,090
as giving everything away for free is

600
00:26:29,090 --> 00:26:30,560
honorable it doesn't pay the mortgage at

601
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:36,380
all which kind of sucked so

602
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:38,940
geben suck some of the life at me the

603
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:40,380
bat moss actually the thing I didn't

604
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:42,360
talk about is it's probably the the one

605
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:44,040
thing that made me consider quitting

606
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:47,910
entirely the police interactions I've

607
00:26:47,910 --> 00:26:52,440
have been a mix of emotions and over the

608
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:54,210
years I've had could have a decent share

609
00:26:54,210 --> 00:26:57,240
of cease and desist emails either kind

610
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:00,620
of stolen content put on Jo spin or

611
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:02,610
actually has someone recently saying

612
00:27:02,610 --> 00:27:05,040
someone posted up all their personal

613
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:07,620
details on ji spin which you know I take

614
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:09,000
down immediately it's something someone

615
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,520
tells me something's breaking the law or

616
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:15,450
even like that kind of stuff that is I

617
00:27:15,450 --> 00:27:21,760
don't know anyway I take it down so that

618
00:27:21,770 --> 00:27:25,170
isn't my phone by the way hello one

619
00:27:25,170 --> 00:27:31,500
pointing up but so early 2010 I've been

620
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:34,410
doing a lot client work and it was in

621
00:27:34,410 --> 00:27:36,900
the evening like seven or eight pm the

622
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:41,970
phone rings and Julie my wife took the

623
00:27:41,970 --> 00:27:44,100
call and she comes fine Mitch named find

624
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:45,500
me I think I might been on the throne

625
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:50,280
she's like you need to take this it's

626
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:54,390
the police it's like okay why the police

627
00:27:54,390 --> 00:27:56,700
phoning me like on my phone rather than

628
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:59,220
I know how people communicate replace

629
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:03,750
any way yeah so the police officer I

630
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:07,520
spoke to he was like so people are using

631
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:10,830
J's bin to coordinate attack on I think

632
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:14,070
was a bank and they have they using Jay

633
00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:16,710
has been there planning to attack like a

634
00:28:16,710 --> 00:28:19,080
denial-of-service this Bank in a couple

635
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:21,600
of days and because his English she was

636
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:24,720
like could you possibly maybe if you

637
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:27,030
could possibly take those bins down if

638
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:30,630
it was possible because I'm ENGLISH I

639
00:28:30,630 --> 00:28:33,030
was like I'm sorry yep I can but he

640
00:28:33,030 --> 00:28:34,260
understood what Jay has been was he

641
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:35,610
worth he didn't say like take the whole

642
00:28:35,610 --> 00:28:36,900
thing down he'd actually taken the time

643
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:38,520
to look at what Jay has been worsened

644
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:41,040
and he could see that I should be able

645
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:44,390
to possibly take down those those bins

646
00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:47,250
which I did immediately like it was it

647
00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:49,200
was totally cool I didn't hear from him

648
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:49,560
again

649
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:52,590
but it kind of bummed me out that these

650
00:28:52,590 --> 00:28:55,050
these people are using Jo spin is the

651
00:28:55,050 --> 00:28:56,820
place to share the the webpage I could

652
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:59,010
just email each other a web page and

653
00:28:59,010 --> 00:29:06,880
attack a bank see ya that's true right

654
00:29:06,890 --> 00:29:10,830
so this is the worst email I ever

655
00:29:10,830 --> 00:29:13,290
received I got an email from the Spanish

656
00:29:13,290 --> 00:29:16,380
police as a sort of cease and desist it

657
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:18,750
included two links to Jay has been

658
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:24,870
asking for immediate takedown and I'd

659
00:29:24,870 --> 00:29:27,030
had issues in the past where monographie

660
00:29:27,030 --> 00:29:29,040
even put on Jay has been made I tried to

661
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:31,250
block it with the blacklist and so on

662
00:29:31,250 --> 00:29:34,800
but the email from the Spanish police

663
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:36,420
didn't tell me what was behind the links

664
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:38,730
and I have to check them before actually

665
00:29:38,730 --> 00:29:41,310
just delete them so I clicks on one of

666
00:29:41,310 --> 00:29:44,430
the links starts loading and very

667
00:29:44,430 --> 00:29:45,810
quickly I realized actually what I was

668
00:29:45,810 --> 00:29:48,060
about to see was child nog raphy I

669
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:51,060
didn't I mean I didn't get to see what

670
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:52,530
I'd never want to see and obviously you

671
00:29:52,530 --> 00:29:53,910
know it's terrible for the people

672
00:29:53,910 --> 00:29:56,820
involved it it was yeah it's harrowing

673
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:59,340
it's really horrible I close the browser

674
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:05,940
fast enough and what I did was curl the

675
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:07,620
URLs down and look for commonalities

676
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:10,110
between those two between the two

677
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:13,590
sources and found a website where we

678
00:30:13,590 --> 00:30:14,970
could see the website the images being

679
00:30:14,970 --> 00:30:17,640
hosted on and just immediately deleted

680
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:19,140
everything in the database put in the

681
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:20,790
black list destroyed everything in a

682
00:30:20,790 --> 00:30:24,300
database that was had that n and

683
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:26,670
actually from doing the research for

684
00:30:26,670 --> 00:30:29,160
this I deleted all the emails to do with

685
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:32,010
this and I just did not want to ever

686
00:30:32,010 --> 00:30:34,680
think about it again it was I thought

687
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:36,720
the worst because I'm building this

688
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:40,620
thing for to help people and eventually

689
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:42,510
like the the worst thing turns up on

690
00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:44,780
this website that you give crafted and

691
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:49,290
yeah absolutely worst so enlighten note

692
00:30:49,290 --> 00:30:53,640
terrorism this was a bin that was an

693
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:56,820
issue that was raised on j/s bin j spin

694
00:30:56,820 --> 00:31:00,450
is being used for terrorism okay cool

695
00:31:00,450 --> 00:31:02,670
I've made my way into all the way up to

696
00:31:02,670 --> 00:31:03,299
that

697
00:31:03,299 --> 00:31:08,070
and it was being used Jasmine was being

698
00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:09,989
used to attack the Madison Police

699
00:31:09,989 --> 00:31:13,710
website apparently organized by these

700
00:31:13,710 --> 00:31:18,330
guys and I took down a bin straightaway

701
00:31:18,330 --> 00:31:21,029
as requested I then did find the

702
00:31:21,029 --> 00:31:22,860
original source of the tweet that had

703
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:24,480
the been in it and it was 10 days before

704
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,639
the issue is raised so whatever happened

705
00:31:26,639 --> 00:31:28,679
at being done and dusted I did put out

706
00:31:28,679 --> 00:31:31,169
tweet saying that jasmine is open source

707
00:31:31,169 --> 00:31:33,269
so if anonymous want to actually clone

708
00:31:33,269 --> 00:31:35,489
their own copy they should go ahead save

709
00:31:35,489 --> 00:31:37,379
me from being you know the single point

710
00:31:37,379 --> 00:31:41,009
of failure for some of those attacks see

711
00:31:41,009 --> 00:31:44,100
ya that was that was fun and I've tried

712
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:46,830
to kind of end each section with like

713
00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:49,320
this is how I would make it better I'm

714
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:50,970
from with this is that like I don't know

715
00:31:50,970 --> 00:31:53,759
I don't have a parting advice for how to

716
00:31:53,759 --> 00:31:55,980
like deal with the absolute worst

717
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:59,039
that kind of comes down obviously Jay

718
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:01,679
has been is open for all its that

719
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:03,090
includes kids wanting to learn but also

720
00:32:03,090 --> 00:32:04,830
includes people wanting to absolutely

721
00:32:04,830 --> 00:32:09,409
destroy things on the web as well but in

722
00:32:09,409 --> 00:32:11,549
going through all of this I was worried

723
00:32:11,549 --> 00:32:12,830
that I'd have this really bitter tale

724
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:15,059
sure it's not kind of a happy kind of

725
00:32:15,059 --> 00:32:19,619
like who at the end but in kind of like

726
00:32:19,619 --> 00:32:21,539
writing out this talk and I end up

727
00:32:21,539 --> 00:32:24,119
putting a like a 6000 block 6,000 word

728
00:32:24,119 --> 00:32:26,369
blog post together end up being a really

729
00:32:26,369 --> 00:32:28,710
cathartic process I got a lot of the

730
00:32:28,710 --> 00:32:32,159
poison out my blood I felt like I kind

731
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:33,869
of cleaned out and got it off my chest

732
00:32:33,869 --> 00:32:37,470
and shared some of the stories and since

733
00:32:37,470 --> 00:32:39,539
kind of getting this all down on paper

734
00:32:39,539 --> 00:32:41,850

738
00:32:51,799 --> 00:32:53,850
