00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:09,560

I want to show you how you can save

2
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:13,370
lives with JavaScript I have been

3
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:16,160
working in the past 15 months developing

4
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:19,280
JavaScript offline applications to help

5
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:22,730
on the Ebola outbreak response and it

6
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:27,200
has been quite a journey and impressive

7
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:31,070
thing but not always an easy path we

8
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:33,320
have fun a lot of challenges we have

9
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:35,989
made a lot of mistakes and and we have

10
00:00:35,989 --> 00:00:37,850
learned a lot thankfully so I want to

11
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:40,160
serve the learnings with you so if you

12
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:42,289
happen to find yourself developing

13
00:00:42,289 --> 00:00:44,329
offline applications then maybe you

14
00:00:44,329 --> 00:00:48,219
won't do the same mistakes all right

15
00:00:48,219 --> 00:00:51,920
Ebola answered you all know a lot about

16
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,839
Ebola because it has been in the media

17
00:00:53,839 --> 00:00:56,449
quite often in the past year but I'm

18
00:00:56,449 --> 00:00:58,039
going to review some facts so you will

19
00:00:58,039 --> 00:01:02,390
understand better how they fight against

20
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:07,130
Ebola work so Ebola unfortunately is

21
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:09,440
quite an unknown disease one of the

22
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:11,030
things we don't know about it is how to

23
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:12,380
cure it there is no confinement

24
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:15,079
treatment yet so the only thing you can

25
00:01:15,079 --> 00:01:17,119
do is to take the sick people to a

26
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:20,000
medical facility and keep them strong

27
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,509
and hydrated and make sure that their

28
00:01:23,509 --> 00:01:27,399
body is at their best to fight the virus

29
00:01:27,399 --> 00:01:30,350
however there is a couple of good things

30
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:31,939
about Ebola in comparison with other

31
00:01:31,939 --> 00:01:35,119
signals one is that contagion requires

32
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:37,909
direct contact with body fluids of an

33
00:01:37,909 --> 00:01:39,799
infected person it's not airborne like a

34
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:43,310
cold for example the other one is like

35
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:47,359
while it is very infectious the sixth

36
00:01:47,359 --> 00:01:49,969
person is only contagious after sowing

37
00:01:49,969 --> 00:01:52,159
symptoms and like the flu for example

38
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:53,299
that you are probably giving to

39
00:01:53,299 --> 00:01:55,070
everybody around you and you don't even

40
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:58,429
realize you are sick yet we also know

41
00:01:58,429 --> 00:02:00,350
that the incubation period is up to

42
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:02,320
three weeks

43
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:06,310
so the way their response to the Ebola

44
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:08,890
outbreak works is by trying to stop it

45
00:02:08,890 --> 00:02:10,600
from spreading and this is done by

46
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:13,900
contact tracing contact tracing means

47
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:16,240
that when you find somebody who is sick

48
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,370
after bringing that person to a hospital

49
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:21,010
to be treated you have to find everybody

50
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:23,500
who has had a significant contact with

51
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:26,320
that person for the past days and these

52
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:28,360
people are potentially infected with a

53
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,310
bulletin so you have to keep them in a

54
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:32,590
sort of quarantine and check on them for

55
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:34,360
three weeks to see if they develop

56
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,730
symptoms if they don't then awesome they

57
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:38,560
are healthy and if they do then you

58
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,170
continue the process so there are two

59
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:42,489
important things on here one is

60
00:02:42,489 --> 00:02:44,980
following up in contacts and the other

61
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:47,610
one is making sure if somebody is sick

62
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:50,709
and that was not a contact you knew then

63
00:02:50,709 --> 00:02:52,870
you find that person as soon as possible

64
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:55,090
so that you can stop the sickness from

65
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:58,420
spreading further that was quite

66
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:01,570
difficult in the West African countries

67
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:04,120
where ever hit very hard in Guinea

68
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:06,640
Liberia and Sierra Leone so what they

69
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,160
did is to set up an emergency phone

70
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:12,390
number where people can call with any

71
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:14,860
Ebola related emergency saying that

72
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:17,620
somebody sick or somebody's dead or just

73
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:20,290
asking for information education is very

74
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:21,760
important here too because at the

75
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,010
beginning of the outbreak people didn't

76
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:26,140
know how to deal with Ebola or what was

77
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:28,420
it or some people didn't even believe it

78
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:32,170
assisted so how does java script enter

79
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:35,320
the question here I work for a health

80
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:37,690
Africa this is a Nigerian based NGO that

81
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:41,019
aims to help vulnerable communities live

82
00:03:41,019 --> 00:03:43,299
healthier lives especially in English

83
00:03:43,299 --> 00:03:46,000
Africa and I'm part of the soccer team

84
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,640
and we try to apply technology wherever

85
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,100
it can to help improving these health

86
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:53,890
systems part of it was working on the

87
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:57,670
Ebola outbreak response what do we do

88
00:03:57,670 --> 00:04:00,250
first we started in Nigeria because this

89
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:03,040
is where we are based and we realized

90
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,769
that the way their responses work in

91
00:04:05,769 --> 00:04:08,019
there is there is these people the

92
00:04:08,019 --> 00:04:10,389
contact tracers that go to visit the

93
00:04:10,389 --> 00:04:12,639
contacts at home every day and see if

94
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:13,240
they have developed

95
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,670
symptoms and they were using paper forms

96
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:17,830
and this is that for an ideal because

97
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:21,130
you know paper is like paper doesn't

98
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:23,110
have her check in if you forget to feel

99
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:24,340
a mandatory field paper is not

100
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:26,650
complaining or if you're hungry teen

101
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:28,210
it's absolutely horrible and nobody

102
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:30,730
understand if you write the name wrong

103
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:33,730
and then it's not clear which contacted

104
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:38,020
you follow up also is easy to lowes I

105
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:40,540
managed to do it all the time it can be

106
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:42,630
destroyed by getting wet for example and

107
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:45,580
vapor tablets lo you have to take the

108
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:47,140
paper yourself to the place you want it

109
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:49,870
to be the place you wanted to be is in

110
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:51,550
this case the emergency operation center

111
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:53,320
where they take the information and

112
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:56,620
decide what to do with in and they also

113
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:58,510
digitalize it so they can do far than

114
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:01,630
analytics and planned strategy but again

115
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:03,820
digital IC needs is like typing typing

116
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:05,560
all this paper which is a slow and

117
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:08,260
error-prone and something we humans are

118
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:11,800
very bad at so what we did is we realize

119
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:14,830
this is basically a form right so we

120
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:17,260
provide in with a very simple mobile

121
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:19,420
application where they just have a drop

122
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:20,860
down where they select the person they

123
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:23,560
are following and and this way they

124
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,200
cannot make mistakes with the name and

125
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:28,950
then they feel the symptoms and safe and

126
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:31,390
and when they do as a bonus you can

127
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:33,550
store the GPS coordinates and this way

128
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:35,440
you are sure that the person really

129
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:39,040
visited the contact this way the data

130
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,420
were digitalized from the very first

131
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:43,600
moment so we were able also to provide

132
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,250
the emergency operation center with

133
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:48,330
another tool that let them see the

134
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:50,800
information about contact tracing and

135
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,760
about the outbreak in real time internet

136
00:05:54,760 --> 00:06:00,970
gods willing so in the call center it

137
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:03,690
was even a more extreme case because

138
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:05,830
first the call center was in Sierra

139
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:07,180
Leone where the scale of the outbreak

140
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:11,290
wats much bigger and also there were a

141
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:14,770
lot of course arrived in every day so

142
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:17,800
there is the operators who are receiving

143
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:20,530
the calls and then there is these you

144
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:22,120
can see two teens here like the burial

145
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:22,889
team the

146
00:06:22,889 --> 00:06:26,280
19 there is also the ambulance team for

147
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:30,060
sick people so they were using different

148
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:34,229
things from paper to excel but it was in

149
00:06:34,229 --> 00:06:35,340
general is low and they were not so

150
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:37,620
happy with it imagine paper for example

151
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:39,419
you have the operators taking calls for

152
00:06:39,419 --> 00:06:40,889
very stressed people and they have to

153
00:06:40,889 --> 00:06:42,569
type everything super fast because they

154
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:44,969
have to collect a lot of data and then

155
00:06:44,969 --> 00:06:47,389
they hung and another call comes and

156
00:06:47,389 --> 00:06:50,249
paper is piling up and then these other

157
00:06:50,249 --> 00:06:51,810
people they have to go through the pile

158
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:53,969
of paper and find what is relevant for

159
00:06:53,969 --> 00:06:56,639
them because some of the calls are just

160
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:58,229
asking for information and some of the

161
00:06:58,229 --> 00:07:01,139
calls are from somebody saying that this

162
00:07:01,139 --> 00:07:03,569
is the third time in a row they are

163
00:07:03,569 --> 00:07:05,460
calling and that's somebody's sick and

164
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:11,460
waiting at home for three days so we did

165
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:13,469
a custom application for them that makes

166
00:07:13,469 --> 00:07:15,659
them allows them to enter the

167
00:07:15,659 --> 00:07:17,370
information faster and then for these

168
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:19,379
three teams taking care of the response

169
00:07:19,379 --> 00:07:20,789
they can feel that the information they

170
00:07:20,789 --> 00:07:23,460
need so it's not nothing very

171
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:25,620
complicated but these two application

172
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:28,469
managed to speed the process and to make

173
00:07:28,469 --> 00:07:30,659
their life easier in the case of the

174
00:07:30,659 --> 00:07:33,750
contact tracing the time from collecting

175
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:35,669
the data to having this data available

176
00:07:35,669 --> 00:07:37,710
in the emergency operation center was 12

177
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:41,279
hours and it become almost instantly in

178
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:43,020
the case of the call center there was an

179
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:45,360
article this summer saying that all the

180
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,089
improvements that have gone and that

181
00:07:48,089 --> 00:07:49,169
have been happening in the call center

182
00:07:49,169 --> 00:07:51,509
for months including software

183
00:07:51,509 --> 00:07:55,289
improvements brought the response time

184
00:07:55,289 --> 00:07:58,860
from an average of five days down to 24

185
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:01,919
hours which is I mean you think about it

186
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:04,439
if you are sick wait in five days for

187
00:08:04,439 --> 00:08:07,909
somebody to help you is not very nice

188
00:08:07,909 --> 00:08:10,589
but as I said this is not I mean this is

189
00:08:10,589 --> 00:08:12,659
not rocket science this is basically a

190
00:08:12,659 --> 00:08:15,210
lot of web forms bunch of rates API

191
00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:17,819
calls and a lot of processing a little

192
00:08:17,819 --> 00:08:19,830
bit of processing on the data but it's

193
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:21,830
something easy for us developers right

194
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:24,719
however we have a constraint that make

195
00:08:24,719 --> 00:08:28,529
our life more difficult that's internet

196
00:08:28,529 --> 00:08:32,310
is not working or yes or slow or you

197
00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:35,900
never know so you have to

198
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:37,580
make sure that applications can work

199
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:41,960
offline fortunately we have the help of

200
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:44,320
an awesome piece of technology Cal TB

201
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:48,710
cod CB is a non SQL database and that

202
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:54,800
stores JSON documents and the part of

203
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,530
Cal CB that make it super good for

204
00:08:57,530 --> 00:09:00,410
offline application is that is very good

205
00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:04,250
with distributed systems and it has a

206
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:05,750
couple of bonus one is that it allows

207
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:08,270
you to do much reduced operations in

208
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:10,580
your takeaway just JavaScript so it's

209
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:13,550
very good for data processing and the

210
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:15,620
second one is that it is pose regular

211
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:18,500
HTTP IPA so if the only thing you have

212
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,210
to do is basically store data and

213
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:22,310
retrieve it and process it a bit then

214
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:24,110
cuts the we can be your back end and

215
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:28,040
that was the case for us actually so the

216
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,360
only thing we are missing here is how to

217
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,120
store the data offline in the browser

218
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:35,480
and for that we were using another great

219
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:38,390
open source library positive in that

220
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:42,110
implements sort of couchdb database but

221
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:46,670
in your browser we also use a little bit

222
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:50,390
of angular and Cordoba for the mobile

223
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:51,950
application I forgot to put the logo

224
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:56,600
here and this statistic allow us to move

225
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:59,720
very fast for both applications we have

226
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,220
a prototype ready in three days a

227
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:03,230
prototype I mean something that we can

228
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:05,720
so to the people and as them like is

229
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:08,840
this useful for you but even so within a

230
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,610
week we had something with in production

231
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:13,820
like something buggy and with not so

232
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:16,100
many features but it was helping already

233
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:22,880
and after a lot of weekends and nights

234
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:28,250
of crazy back Dixon Ebola was over in

235
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:30,980
Nigeria after a couple of months and we

236
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:33,020
were asked if we can take our

237
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:35,480
applications and and use them in the

238
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:37,400
other three countries in Liberia Sierra

239
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:40,790
Leone and Guinea and that's when we

240
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:43,990
started to find problems

241
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:46,720
the first growling we find is because

242
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,519
okay so we created our first apps for

243
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:51,320
Nigeria and here you can see the

244
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:53,510
different on the scale of the outbreak

245
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:55,399
in Nigeria you cannot even see the

246
00:10:55,399 --> 00:10:58,100
number of cases because in total there

247
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:00,230
were like 20 sick people in Nigeria

248
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:03,560
while in Sierra Leone it was like 14,000

249
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:07,300
and we have started with our simple

250
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:09,110
basically following the puck Stevie

251
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:11,540
tutorial we do these we replicate

252
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:14,149
replicate our whole remote database in

253
00:11:14,149 --> 00:11:16,730
our browser awesome we can go as if we

254
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:20,389
were all the time online yeah of course

255
00:11:20,389 --> 00:11:21,860
that was not such a good idea the

256
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:24,079
browser started complaining that we were

257
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:26,839
being too greedy and apparently browsers

258
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:28,430
half a limit for the amount of space you

259
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:32,779
can take since we were very stressed and

260
00:11:32,779 --> 00:11:34,279
we have so many things to fix we thought

261
00:11:34,279 --> 00:11:37,579
like well well crumbs let us use six

262
00:11:37,579 --> 00:11:39,740
percent of the harddrive we'll just do

263
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:43,579
that what can go wrong yeah and that

264
00:11:43,579 --> 00:11:45,350
didn't solve the problem the next thing

265
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:47,870
we saw is that the replication the first

266
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:48,949
time somebody was using the application

267
00:11:48,949 --> 00:11:50,889
was going like for taking ten minutes

268
00:11:50,889 --> 00:11:54,529
220 240 and that was in Berlin but we

269
00:11:54,529 --> 00:11:56,779
were saying like a 40 minutes it's not

270
00:11:56,779 --> 00:11:58,880
that bad right but the people in Liberia

271
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,860
were telling us like no guys this is

272
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:03,709
never finishing the latency library has

273
00:12:03,709 --> 00:12:05,750
worse the internet is more unstable so

274
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:07,519
they were not even able to to use the

275
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:11,060
application so the problem is that we

276
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:12,889
just took the easy path and replicate

277
00:12:12,889 --> 00:12:14,779
everything and that's take too much

278
00:12:14,779 --> 00:12:18,110
space and replication is a slow but why

279
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:20,660
were what why were we replicating

280
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:22,959
everything really do we need everything

281
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:26,600
well use your domain knowledge and see

282
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:30,199
what do you need offline in the case of

283
00:12:30,199 --> 00:12:32,750
our contact tracing up for example we

284
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:35,260
realize we only need contacts that are

285
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:37,550
created in the past three weeks because

286
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:38,630
after that they are out of the

287
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:41,600
quarantine only in my area because a

288
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,300
particular person doing conduct racing

289
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:46,760
only working in one area not in a whole

290
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:50,000
country if they don't have symptoms

291
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,949
because otherwise they are out of the

292
00:12:51,949 --> 00:12:53,220
quarantine to

293
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:56,009
and from those only the names and ID's

294
00:12:56,009 --> 00:12:59,730
to sew it in order down so we change our

295
00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:03,899
replicating everything to replicate just

296
00:13:03,899 --> 00:13:05,759
the information we needed this is our

297
00:13:05,759 --> 00:13:08,850
remote database on the left and on the

298
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:12,029
right you can see that when we had

299
00:13:12,029 --> 00:13:13,740
connections the database we were getting

300
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:16,290
a list of names and ids and we were

301
00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:17,850
storing that in our database in our

302
00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:20,069
browser and then we could create

303
00:13:20,069 --> 00:13:23,819
follow-up information and we will

304
00:13:23,819 --> 00:13:25,319
synchronize that to the remote database

305
00:13:25,319 --> 00:13:27,959
whenever we had internet but we didn't

306
00:13:27,959 --> 00:13:29,610
need to have all these follow-ups in

307
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:34,560
every single phone in the case of the

308
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,089
call center however it was different

309
00:13:36,089 --> 00:13:37,860
because we try to reduce the data set

310
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:40,350
and still the smallest data set was too

311
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:43,589
weak and also we realize instead of

312
00:13:43,589 --> 00:13:45,509
making things faster we will make you

313
00:13:45,509 --> 00:13:49,740
need us nowhere how is that well if they

314
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:51,810
were using paper the operator will be

315
00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:53,430
taking all the information in paper and

316
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:54,899
the people sending ambulances for

317
00:13:54,899 --> 00:13:57,480
example will be here I can just take the

318
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:59,160
paper and hand it out to this other

319
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:02,100
person in our case we were trying to

320
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:03,899
have all the information available all

321
00:14:03,899 --> 00:14:05,519
the time in all the computer with means

322
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:08,459
that the operator will fill out the data

323
00:14:08,459 --> 00:14:10,769
that will go all the way to the internet

324
00:14:10,769 --> 00:14:12,569
and back to the person sitting next to

325
00:14:12,569 --> 00:14:15,600
me the problem is that maybe internet is

326
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,329
not going to work for two hours and then

327
00:14:17,329 --> 00:14:19,860
the fact of passing this information

328
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:24,000
takes two hours which is crazy so what

329
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,470
we realized is that we were really

330
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:26,939
trying to solve a software problem

331
00:14:26,939 --> 00:14:28,829
almost for the sake of it almost because

332
00:14:28,829 --> 00:14:30,300
we thought it would be cool to make it

333
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:33,870
work like that what we realize is we

334
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:35,160
need these people to have the

335
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,839
information within a call center

336
00:14:36,839 --> 00:14:39,029
available as soon as possible and then

337
00:14:39,029 --> 00:14:41,970
maybe the other call centers can get

338
00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:43,379
this information with a little bit of a

339
00:14:43,379 --> 00:14:46,410
delay so we forgot about but to be

340
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:48,209
completely here and we just set up a

341
00:14:48,209 --> 00:14:50,009
local CouchDB database in each of the

342
00:14:50,009 --> 00:14:52,559
centers and then whenever they have

343
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:54,180
internet they can synchronize to the

344
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:56,279
remote database and then that

345
00:14:56,279 --> 00:14:57,959
information will get back to the other

346
00:14:57,959 --> 00:15:02,069
call centers actually that allow us to

347
00:15:02,069 --> 00:15:04,439
have call centers that have no access to

348
00:15:04,439 --> 00:15:06,149
internet whatsoever because you can

349
00:15:06,149 --> 00:15:06,750
sometimes

350
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:08,220
our dedicated telephone line between

351
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:10,440
them and then the second call center

352
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:12,330
will take care of synchronized to the

353
00:15:12,330 --> 00:15:16,380
internet so solve real world problems

354
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:21,770
and replicas late on only what you need

355
00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:24,720
a second very common problem if you are

356
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,220
dealing with offline applications is

357
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:28,380
dealing with conflicts why do I mean by

358
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:33,450
conflicts this was our original data

359
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:35,640
model in the database and so we have the

360
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:37,310
remote database and to contact tracers

361
00:15:37,310 --> 00:15:39,720
let's assume for simplicity that they

362
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:43,260
only synchronize data at night so we

363
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:45,360
have day to both contact tracers have

364
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:48,030
the information day three one of them

365
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:51,330
goes to visit the person and at night

366
00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:54,570
there is no internet therefore the

367
00:15:54,570 --> 00:15:56,130
second coat that tracer goes to follow

368
00:15:56,130 --> 00:15:58,920
up on that person and at night internet

369
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:00,540
works again and they try to synchronize

370
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:05,160
and Cal Stevie says okay guys I have a

371
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:07,470
document you both have modify it I have

372
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:10,770
no idea which one of you is right so I'm

373
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:12,510
just going to set up this has set this

374
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:14,510
as a conflict and it's for you to decide

375
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:17,010
you can do that you can decide what's

376
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:19,290
the right information but you can do

377
00:16:19,290 --> 00:16:21,210
even better by avoiding completes all

378
00:16:21,210 --> 00:16:25,140
together so what if you design your data

379
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:27,300
model better and keep things that change

380
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:29,640
together together and things that change

381
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:33,089
separated separated this way each one of

382
00:16:33,089 --> 00:16:34,980
the contact tracers will only create new

383
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:36,960
documents and then there will never be

384
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:41,790
conflicts this will have another bonus

385
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:44,010
that is like there is less versions to

386
00:16:44,010 --> 00:16:46,350
maintain because you are not editing the

387
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:49,350
documents all the time so that makes a

388
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:52,520
replication faster and takes lazy space

389
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:55,620
so for avoiding conflicts choose your

390
00:16:55,620 --> 00:17:00,630
data model wisely the third problem I

391
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:04,829
want to tell you about is a nightmare of

392
00:17:04,829 --> 00:17:06,689
somebody making offline applications

393
00:17:06,689 --> 00:17:10,319
which is Dallas we have this other

394
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:12,510
application where we are registering

395
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:14,610
people for a bass ination trial it's

396
00:17:14,610 --> 00:17:16,650
basically taking that information a pic

397
00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:19,260
sure and printing a car and we realize

398
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:21,510
some people had cars and they seemed

399
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:24,570
legit and we don't have this information

400
00:17:24,570 --> 00:17:29,660
in our database well we thought that

401
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:33,150
happened was that at that moment we look

402
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:35,520
and we realize okay index DB is actually

403
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:39,750
temporary storage cool have felt how it

404
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:42,360
works in chrome is that this is your

405
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:44,940
hard drive and this is the space you

406
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:47,910
have available on it and chrome can take

407
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:50,190
one-third of it and every single

408
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:51,750
application within Chrome can only take

409
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:56,430
up to twenty percent of these well we

410
00:17:56,430 --> 00:17:58,020
thought okay this is still a lot of

411
00:17:58,020 --> 00:17:59,780
space right special in a computer

412
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:02,010
although if you think in mobile phones

413
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:04,140
then it's not so much a space but it

414
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:06,290
still will have problems for a long time

415
00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:10,170
however one day we realize that has

416
00:18:10,170 --> 00:18:12,930
disappear and the thing is like what we

417
00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:14,970
haven't thought is that if you keep

418
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:18,630
using available space then the space

419
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:20,700
allows for chrome and applications keeps

420
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:23,880
shrinking and our application was

421
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:27,180
actually making the user take pictures

422
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:29,370
and if they were not deleting these

423
00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:31,290
pictures then of course the hard drive

424
00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:33,810
was shrinking very fast so what happened

425
00:18:33,810 --> 00:18:36,150
when chrome runs out of a space is that

426
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:38,700
it decides to remove their less recently

427
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:43,530
use application all the data from it yep

428
00:18:43,530 --> 00:18:45,870
so this is something to have into

429
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:52,950
account so those squares some of them is

430
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:58,380
take we make we will make even more

431
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:02,940
mistakes I guess but we realize many of

432
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:05,340
them were like sort of beginner mistakes

433
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:07,290
and it was because it was all new for us

434
00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:09,120
this is like state-of-the-art technology

435
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,250
and it's new for us and it's new for the

436
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:13,770
internet so there is no post in a stack

437
00:19:13,770 --> 00:19:15,510
overflow solving your questions there is

438
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:18,090
no 20 tutorials telling you how to scale

439
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:20,760
offline applications so it's a lot of

440
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:24,450
fun an adventure what I can recommend

441
00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:26,160
you if you have to work with the new

442
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,120
technology

443
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:30,330
is get an expert if you can and you only

444
00:19:30,330 --> 00:19:32,910
need one person and knows what's

445
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:36,840
happening to help everybody else and we

446
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:39,540
were super lucky to have one of the core

447
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:41,640
developers of cults to be helping us

448
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:46,470
he's somewhere around here he didn't

449
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:48,540
arrive on time to prevent us from doing

450
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:50,640
their mistakes but he helped us solve

451
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:55,500
them and if you cannot get an expert you

452
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:56,640
kind of still reach out to the community

453
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:59,190
because the thing is that if somebody is

454
00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:00,630
working in an open source project they

455
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:02,070
are probably very passionate about it

456
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:03,720
and if you have an interesting project

457
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,730
and you are pushing the limits then this

458
00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:09,240
is an interesting challenge so reach out

459
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:11,820
to them be nice help them create baths

460
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:14,730
solebox if you can add to documentation

461
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:19,320
and you'll see that they help you okay

462
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:22,679
so actually I wanted to talk about an or

463
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:25,650
theme but I remove the slide because I

464
00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:26,880
thought I didn't have time but now I

465
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:30,240
have plenty I went very fast so another

466
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,340
problem you can find if you are working

467
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:34,080
with all our offline applications is

468
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,620
that you don't have internet at all so

469
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:39,480
all the things I was talking about was

470
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:41,309
about having internet sometimes and

471
00:20:41,309 --> 00:20:43,650
sometimes not if you don't have internet

472
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:46,260
at all then there is still hope right

473
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:50,820
and you just need to make sure that you

474
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:52,530
manage to synchronize things between

475
00:20:52,530 --> 00:20:54,960
devices in some way and how can you do

476
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,210
that well then you so check Matthew

477
00:20:57,210 --> 00:21:00,290
stock from yesterday I'll leave it there

478
00:21:00,290 --> 00:21:05,340
okay so I saw you these charts with all

479
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:08,400
the people that got sick and that died

480
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,340
in West Africa and that was pretty sad

481
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:14,700
so I want to show you to end up on a

482
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:17,070
brighter side how's the state of the

483
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:20,309
outbreak right now we have like period

484
00:21:20,309 --> 00:21:22,950
that have three cases oh it's not easy

485
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:25,740
to see it's three new cases on the week

486
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:27,510
on the twenty-ninth of December this is

487
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:30,000
not so much what it's a little bit sad

488
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,470
is that Liberia has been declared

489
00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:33,420
ebola-free already twice and this is the

490
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:35,760
third time they get a new case but

491
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,830
hopefully they have it under control

492
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:40,590
in Guinea there is only one new case and

493
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:44,429
it was on 29 of double so this hope that

494
00:21:44,429 --> 00:21:46,789
they will declare it a valid reason and

495
00:21:46,789 --> 00:21:49,260
they will outbreak ended in Sierra Leone

496
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:52,649
and Nigeria in Sierra Leone that was

497
00:21:52,649 --> 00:21:56,220
particularly good news because the scale

498
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:58,980
of delray there was crazy and and they

499
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:01,230
were so happy when it ended that they do

500
00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:03,690
they did this time i'm going to show you

501
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:43,310
Oh No okay

502
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:45,400
I'm going to stop it because it's very

503
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,870
long but I think Solarius doesn't check

504
00:22:46,870 --> 00:22:56,230
it out and this is the people from the

505
00:22:56,230 --> 00:22:58,230
call center in Sierra Leone by the way

506
00:22:58,230 --> 00:23:00,820
so I think it's amazing that these

507
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:03,550
people after all the bad things they

508
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:05,470
have gone through they still find the

509
00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:07,390
energy to I don't know to celebrate that

510
00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:09,220
everything is over by dancing and and

511
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:29,510
having fun so let me undo this okay

512
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:36,390
okay so it was an amazing experience to

513
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:39,360
work in this project to find that you

514
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,070
can apply to your skills to do something

515
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:44,160
good for Humanity and I can totally

516
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,960
recommend you and recommend it to you

517
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:51,090
and but it's also amazing for me that

518
00:23:51,090 --> 00:23:53,280
when we arrived here and we try to help

519
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:56,040
we found that with all the technology we

520
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:58,710
are with the way we are advancing

521
00:23:58,710 --> 00:24:00,390
technology and all the time we are

522
00:24:00,390 --> 00:24:03,210
spending on basically writing software

523
00:24:03,210 --> 00:24:06,420
there was nothing prepared to deal with

524
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:08,760
this kind of situation and I mean Ebola

525
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:10,710
is quite buy it but it's still just an

526
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:12,420
epidemic and the way to deal with it is

527
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:15,660
like at any normal epidemic so let's

528
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:18,840
make it better next time as the Time

529
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:20,490
magazine said this is gonna be the last

530
00:24:20,490 --> 00:24:22,680
epidemic and when the next one comes the

531
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:24,330
world must learn the lesson of this one

532
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:26,880
we better prepare less fearful less

533
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,400
reactive run toward the fire and put it
