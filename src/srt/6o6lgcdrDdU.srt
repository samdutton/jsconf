if they are just fun or if they are

9
00:00:21,869 --> 00:00:24,660
useful for something so first of all I

10
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:27,510

00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:32,969
actually from Brazil and well I mean a

13
00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:36,300
relationship with CSS since 2014 and

14
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:38,879
well this is a bit fun but I have to say

15
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:40,940
it was love at the first website and

16
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:44,430
well right now I'm a freelancer UI

17
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:46,079
developer it's opto which is cool

18
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:48,690
because I can work a lot with CSS which

19
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:51,329

20
00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:53,370

00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:55,680
just great to write CSS well my cat is

00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,010
seated behind beside me that's great and

23
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:00,570
I'm sure hockey strawberry is number one

24
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:03,180
fan which are actually they are from

25
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:04,979
Japan but I'm not talking about the ones

26
00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:07,409
from Japan they are actually cultivated

27
00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:09,510
in a small town near my hometown and

28
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:11,549
this strawberries are awesome because

29
00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:13,080
they are just the perfect mixture of

30
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:18,090
sour and sweet I'm Dino Kiki's best

31
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:20,430
friend he is my dinosaur and don't worry

32
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:22,229
I'm gonna talk about him in a couple of

33
00:01:22,229 --> 00:01:24,150
sites so just hanging there about this

34
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:28,020
information okay enough about me and now

35
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:31,049
I want to know about you so I have a

36
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:33,479
question for you please raise your hand

37
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:35,939
if you have a cold just for fun if you

38
00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:38,520
did a project create a lot of people did

39
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,860
it I'm really happy about it it's okay

40
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:42,810
if you didn't because sometimes we just

41
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:44,970
have a lot of work we have a lot when we

42
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:47,009
get home it's okay if you don't have

43
00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:48,810
time for it or if you didn't right now

44
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:50,909
maybe we can change that by the end of

45
00:01:50,909 --> 00:01:54,090
this talk who knows and also I want to

46
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:55,799
know from you if you did include this

47
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:58,500
fun project in your portfolio please

48
00:01:58,500 --> 00:01:59,750
raise your hand fidget

49
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:04,079
okay good not a lot of people but that's

50
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:06,840
good so this talk is all about talking

51
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,750
about how our fun projects can impact

52
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:13,740
not only in our learning but also you

53
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:16,020
no portfolio and what these things can

54
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:18,240
do for our career if they have an impact

55
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,430
or if they're just a firm project we did

56
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:22,050
and maybe we like to share with our

57
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:23,900
friends

58
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:26,970
well as I told you I have this dinosaur

59
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:29,280
it's actually a website it's called Dino

60
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,950
Kiki calm you can access later but I

61
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:34,560
have to say it's a bit loud so just

62
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,570
don't like this in a public place maybe

63
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:39,840
it's a little while and well I curated

64
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,800
this in 2014 and back then I was an

65
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,500
exchange student at United States and I

66
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,750
really needed an internship I was just

67
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:50,940
starting with from and developing and I

68
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:52,920
wanted to know jQuery because it was a

69
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:55,500
hike back then and I didn't know a lot I

70
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,810
just learned that in the university so I

71
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:00,120
decided to create a project so I could

72
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,190
include in my portfolio and maybe get an

73
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:05,130
internship and it was a bit crazy idea

74
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:07,170
because when you click over him he just

75
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:09,030
speaks like the syllable Kiki in

76
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:09,840
different voices

77
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,090
so it's random every time you click over

78
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:14,460
and it's a different Kiki and also the

79
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:15,870
syllables will start popping up on the

80
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:18,450
screen and it was inspired by two things

81
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:21,510
which I kind of useless first is this

82
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:23,730
website called please pet dog you just

83
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:25,320
click over the dog and starts petting

84
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:27,780
him and random things like he's happy

85
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:29,370
you're petting him starts showing up on

86
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:31,950
the screen and also this vine I know

87
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:33,990
vine is dead I'm really sad about it

88
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:36,240
because I really loved buying about this

89
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,490
man walking in the street and screaming

90
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:40,530
Kiki and saying he was a dinosaur it's

91
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:42,420
mama dinosaur finds its baby

92
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:45,300
I like that fine so I put together both

93
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:46,940
of the things and created that website

94
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:50,730
and well it's actually listed on the

95
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:52,710
useless website so we can say it's

96
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:54,660
useless when we think about a business

97
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:57,120
perspective but it's not useless for me

98
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,570
I use it first to learn jQuery but I'm

99
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:03,450
still using it for example last year I

100
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:06,210
started working UJS so I decided to

101
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:08,700
change it to VJ s and lo j s instead of

102
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:10,950
jQuery and PHP which were a bit a little

103
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:11,910
bit outdated

104
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:15,000
and even today I have it on my portfolio

105
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,330
and even the job I'm currently in people

106
00:04:18,330 --> 00:04:20,220
always look at it and say oh cool you

107
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:21,750
have the dinosaur

108
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:26,700
like and it's nice is that it's a way

109
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:28,950
that I created to learn new things or to

110
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:30,840
practice the things that I'm working on

111
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:33,570
and this talk it's about these things

112
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:35,790
and I just wanted to share with you this

113
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:38,910
example but no let's dive in this into

114
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:43,050
the CSS yeah I just saw about the

115
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:45,140
dinosaur but I promise it had a point

116
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:49,590
okay so it's about CSS drawings and

117
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:52,140
games so first of all I just want to

118
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:55,170
show a bit of what is our CSS draw is

119
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:59,310
what is a CSS game so I opened it here a

120
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:00,840
few code pens

121
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,640
this one was not a baby it was made by

122
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:05,670
this person called Marcin I guess it's

123
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:09,000
Peppa Pig okay don't you think this

124
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,300
person had fun well creating this I mean

125
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:14,070
I don't know why this person created

126
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:16,560
maybe Sheila he or he or they liked

127
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,840
liked it or maybe their children liked

128
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:21,870
it I'm not sure even though it's Peppa

129
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:23,910
Pig is a pretty simple drawing probably

130
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:25,620
it wasn't that easy to create this we

131
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:28,620
see a CSS especially when we consider it

132
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:32,340
has borders and ordered things and well

133
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:35,310
this one is when I created about the

134
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:38,060
solar system it's a bit animated and

135
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:40,500
this drawings are the base for the

136
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,090
presentation let me do right now so

137
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:44,160
every drawing on the presentation is

138
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,320
actually ice creams a screenshot of

139
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:50,550
something I draw with CSS and now about

140
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:53,790
games I found this really cool game it

141
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:55,410
was made by this person called Jerry low

142
00:05:55,410 --> 00:05:58,410
it's in cold pan and it's made with only

143
00:05:58,410 --> 00:06:01,110
CSS and you have to stack the yellow

144
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:03,990
squares over each other so for example

145
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:08,100
here okay it's working and then you lose

146
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:10,830
if you do this and then you can play it

147
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:13,229
again so it's an interesting game it's

148
00:06:13,229 --> 00:06:15,900
nice and it's made only with CSS this

149
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:17,430
person probably had to learn new things

150
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:20,900
or practice in if you already know and

151
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:23,840
less there's this roaming I mean

152
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:27,150
probably you saw it on the Internet this

153
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:30,690
is just awesome this I mean it's really

154
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:32,729
hard to create something like this with

155
00:06:32,729 --> 00:06:35,160
any kind of thing like even with paper

156
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:38,160
or with pain and we call it's just

157
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,250
awesome so I just want to remember you

158
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:46,380
all that CSS yeah also be art so I made

159
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:49,680
this emojis lies just to have to inspire

160
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:54,710
how I felt when I saw this and well know

161
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:57,930
hopefully you remember what CSS drawings

162
00:06:57,930 --> 00:07:00,470
and games are or if you didn't know and

163
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:03,300
when is all of this when I did some I

164
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:05,580
was wondering every everything I learned

165
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:07,680
and how I liked this things and they

166
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,780
were helping me to exercise part of this

167
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:12,930
CSS and HTML things and I was wondering

168
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:14,670
if other people felt like it so I

169
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:16,980
decided to conduct a survey with

170
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:18,570
Brazilian developers because this area

171
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:20,910
was in Portuguese and I created a

172
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:22,980
Kitchener and shared on Twitter Facebook

173
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:25,530
and other social networks asking about

174
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:27,810
how people felt about these things so

175
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:29,310
the first question but there are six

176
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:32,670
participants 60 and the first question

177
00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:34,950
was if they ever heard about CSS

178
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:38,400
drawings or games and I'm gonna make you

179
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,950
we were folks raise your hand again of

180
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:42,750
your time so I want to know from you

181
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:45,450
before the stop have you ever heard

182
00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:47,520
about both of these topics or any of

183
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:52,110
these topics cool I was expecting a lot

184
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:54,090
of people because we're in at CSS comp

185
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:57,120
and that's great and I was expecting

186
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,130
also a lot of people to say they did on

187
00:07:59,130 --> 00:08:01,530
my survey that happened I think

188
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:04,190
seventy-seven percent it's a good number

189
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:07,320
but then I decided to ask if this

190
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:10,950
developers created a CSS drawing I want

191
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:12,570
to know from you did you ever create a

192
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:16,320
lot CSS Joey yeah we got a similar

193
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:16,890
result

194
00:08:16,890 --> 00:08:21,450
and most of people didn't then I decided

195
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:23,250
to ask about games I mean I was

196
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:24,990
expecting a very low number because I

197
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:27,240
think CSS games are something that are

198
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:31,620
not as popular and I promise this is the

199
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:33,719
last time did you ever develop a game

200
00:08:33,719 --> 00:08:38,340
it's only HTML CSS and you are cool we

201
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:41,460
have people who did it and well my

202
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:44,520
survey we got like one person I was a

203
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:47,100
bit sad but most of all it made me think

204
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:49,089
about why why pee

205
00:08:49,089 --> 00:08:50,709
but you know what it is maybe they

206
00:08:50,709 --> 00:08:53,709
really love CSS but it's not a way they

207
00:08:53,709 --> 00:08:56,680
usually experiment with CSS maybe they

208
00:08:56,680 --> 00:09:00,519
do other kinds of experiments but I

209
00:09:00,519 --> 00:09:02,230
asked it I also asked it this

210
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:03,790
participants if they learned something

211
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:07,509
new from this experience and they did

212
00:09:07,509 --> 00:09:11,199
learn but I think this is one of the

213
00:09:11,199 --> 00:09:13,569
things that make people not want to draw

214
00:09:13,569 --> 00:09:17,350
or play or develop a game with CSS it's

215
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:20,709
something that is fun but maybe just the

216
00:09:20,709 --> 00:09:22,600
people think is not something good for

217
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,970
their career which I completely disagree

218
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:28,240
because when we say something is useless

219
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,819
we're saying that it's useless in the

220
00:09:30,819 --> 00:09:33,279
business perspective or something we do

221
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:35,439
in our everyday lives but it can be

222
00:09:35,439 --> 00:09:36,040
useless

223
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:39,220
it cannot is not useless for us or for

224
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:41,649
other people who are working with this

225
00:09:41,649 --> 00:09:44,649
technology and okay going back to the

226
00:09:44,649 --> 00:09:46,899
part where I just said the participant

227
00:09:46,899 --> 00:09:48,850
said it helped them to learn something

228
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:51,129
by creating the CSS games or drawings

229
00:09:51,129 --> 00:09:53,829
and specifically I asked it a few topics

230
00:09:53,829 --> 00:09:56,110
all of them said it helps you practice

231
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:59,949
creativity because sometimes you just

232
00:09:59,949 --> 00:10:02,290
don't create a drama frontstretch but

233
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:04,420
you can still work on your creativity

234
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:07,569
why why are you a developing it and also

235
00:10:07,569 --> 00:10:10,809
other technical topics such as CSS

236
00:10:10,809 --> 00:10:13,929
positioning HTML tags CSS selectors

237
00:10:13,929 --> 00:10:17,050
several elements and sort of and classes

238
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:19,839
in CSS and I was thinking like I told

239
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:22,269
you so I'm glad more people also learned

240
00:10:22,269 --> 00:10:24,850
something it was not only me they the

241
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:26,800
people who created these things they

242
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:30,249
actually learn something from x but

243
00:10:30,249 --> 00:10:32,620
there is this other code which I think

244
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:34,120
it's something that people say

245
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:36,069
especially when I talk about drawings a

246
00:10:36,069 --> 00:10:38,139
lot of people say well not a lot of

247
00:10:38,139 --> 00:10:40,509
people but someone say well you need to

248
00:10:40,509 --> 00:10:43,059
be super creative about it I cannot just

249
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:45,129
make a drawing I don't have an idea for

250
00:10:45,129 --> 00:10:47,769
it well it's true if you want to create

251
00:10:47,769 --> 00:10:50,170
something new you need to have some

252
00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:51,670
creativity but it doesn't mean that

253
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:54,519
every time you create a drawing or a

254
00:10:54,519 --> 00:10:58,269
game you need to use your own idea like

255
00:10:58,269 --> 00:11:01,840
100% you can't create it

256
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:04,690
using things that already exists so for

257
00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:07,810
example my chip is if you don't have an

258
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:10,270
idea but you want to practice the SS but

259
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:12,070
creating a drawing you can recreate

260
00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:14,530
something that already exists I did this

261
00:11:14,530 --> 00:11:17,860
for example one of my first drawings was

262
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:20,140
this black cat from Sailor Moon called

263
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:23,110
Luna and I want to draw her I don't know

264
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:24,910
why I really like Sailor Moon when I was

265
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:28,660
younger and I searched on Google and I

266
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:31,960
decided to draw probably her head with

267
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:36,100
the moon over it and I created this code

268
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:39,250
but it's actually animator her ears move

269
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:41,700
and I was pretty happy with the result

270
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:44,340
because well I learned those things

271
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:47,200
especially how to create her cheeks and

272
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,660
everything else the moon so I could

273
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:51,640
practice things that I would get that I

274
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:58,000
am going to use on my job and well after

275
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,220
this okay I gave a shape how to start

276
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:03,250
but maybe people just say creating a

277
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:05,260
drawing is not like creating a website I

278
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:08,350
don't know how I can start I mean how do

279
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:09,690
you start a thing like that

280
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:13,570
so I created a cycle that works for me

281
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:16,060
it's not a rule you can use it if you

282
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:18,100
want if you already have yours that's

283
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:19,900
great it'll be cool to talk about it

284
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:21,850
please like let's know other regions

285
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:24,490
would you be ready to drawing and the

286
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:27,340
first step is you get an image and you

287
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:30,010
break it into geometric forms I'm not a

288
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:32,800
very good drawing on the paper but if I

289
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,870
create something that's on my head I

290
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:37,540
draw it very badly on paper and then I

291
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:39,430
try to break it into geometric forms

292
00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:42,370
because by breaking into geometric forms

293
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:44,620
because it's easier to create something

294
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:47,110
in CSS from the geometric forms because

295
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:48,850
probably when we're developing a website

296
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:51,580
we already created like a circle or a

297
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:54,160
square or even triangle so it's better

298
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:57,250
to break these things step number two is

299
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:59,860
to use HTML to represent pieces of the

300
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:02,410
drawing for example you have a drawing

301
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:05,230
that have a head you can call you can

302
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:07,590
have a jib with a class called head and

303
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:10,090
step number three which is the one that

304
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:12,880
takes most of the time is to style each

305
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,750
piece of the HTML

306
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:17,779
so this cycle works for me but as I said

307
00:13:17,779 --> 00:13:21,740
it's not rule right and we're gonna talk

308
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:23,660
a little bit about each one of these

309
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:25,910
steps and how we can create this a more

310
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:30,259
practical way so I am gonna choose Dino

311
00:13:30,259 --> 00:13:32,810
keke as an example this is gonna take

312
00:13:32,810 --> 00:13:36,170
his head which I made only with CSS so

313
00:13:36,170 --> 00:13:38,720
first we break it into geometric forms

314
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:42,980
so here it is this hat is made by this

315
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:45,259
element some of them are repeated so we

316
00:13:45,259 --> 00:13:49,040
have a kind of oval and a rectangle and

317
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,959
that yellow thing which like I have

318
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:55,269
circled I that's his mouth and his teeth

319
00:13:55,269 --> 00:13:58,610
for this I'm gonna use his body or his

320
00:13:58,610 --> 00:14:01,670
head in it as an example so I created

321
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:03,649
this day of called body and well there

322
00:14:03,649 --> 00:14:05,389
will be another one for the eye another

323
00:14:05,389 --> 00:14:09,050
one for the mouth and so on then I'm

324
00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:12,079
gonna style using CSS so I broke it into

325
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:14,480
children choose their magic forms the

326
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:17,959
first one is the body which is an green

327
00:14:17,959 --> 00:14:20,689
oval with border-radius to make it looks

328
00:14:20,689 --> 00:14:23,209
like this and then there is another step

329
00:14:23,209 --> 00:14:25,399
which is his neck which I use it the

330
00:14:25,399 --> 00:14:28,759
potato element after which is just a

331
00:14:28,759 --> 00:14:32,180
rectangle and well when we put both of

332
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:34,519
them together they look like Dino Kiki's

333
00:14:34,519 --> 00:14:38,870
neck or head and you can do that with

334
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:40,579
different things if it's a more complex

335
00:14:40,579 --> 00:14:42,230
drawing you're probably gonna have to do

336
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:43,939
it over and over again and you're

337
00:14:43,939 --> 00:14:45,259
probably gonna have to worry about

338
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:49,389
pixels and how to combine things so

339
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:51,649
differently for a website which you can

340
00:14:51,649 --> 00:14:54,439
use flexbox or grid in this case when

341
00:14:54,439 --> 00:14:57,139
it's like a drawing from an animal or a

342
00:14:57,139 --> 00:15:00,860
person I tend to use like left and top

343
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:02,329
positions more observable positions

344
00:15:02,329 --> 00:15:04,160
because the same way as if we were

345
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,930
driving on the paper it would think oh

346
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:08,959
this looks better like right here so the

347
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:11,300
same thing happens with CSS it's just

348
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:13,399
one pixel I for one pixel right can

349
00:15:13,399 --> 00:15:15,170
change the drawing so that's why I use

350
00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:19,699
absolute positioning okay I talked about

351
00:15:19,699 --> 00:15:21,559
drawings you may have an idea Hotch

352
00:15:21,559 --> 00:15:23,000
greater drawing hopefully you really

353
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,350
think about I'm gonna make a drawing

354
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:26,089
let's think about what I'm gonna to draw

355
00:15:26,089 --> 00:15:28,339
but I didn't talk about CSS

356
00:15:28,339 --> 00:15:31,339
games they just showed one so not the

357
00:15:31,339 --> 00:15:33,589
time to talk about CSS games and I'm

358
00:15:33,589 --> 00:15:37,189
excited okay so I'm gonna present to you

359
00:15:37,189 --> 00:15:40,850
I space team memory game this game was

360
00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:45,709
made with no images no JavaScript no CSS

361
00:15:45,709 --> 00:15:48,199
preprocessors everything our playing and

362
00:15:48,199 --> 00:15:52,689
cool CSS and it's actually responsive

363
00:15:52,689 --> 00:15:55,670
okay can we play that or the probably

364
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:58,069
sounds a bit boring but I don't think

365
00:15:58,069 --> 00:16:05,329
it's boring so let's play it okay so

366
00:16:05,329 --> 00:16:08,329
here's the game in the memory game it's

367
00:16:08,329 --> 00:16:10,790
a set of cards that we have to find the

368
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:12,889
similar cards hopefully you play that

369
00:16:12,889 --> 00:16:13,790
when you were a child

370
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:16,100
but if you didn't for example we have

371
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:18,019
like animals and we have to find the two

372
00:16:18,019 --> 00:16:20,360
monkeys or the chuji laughs and then we

373
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:23,629
set this card Society this one is made

374
00:16:23,629 --> 00:16:27,860
with planets and on the solar system so

375
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:30,019
the first thing I do is I click on the

376
00:16:30,019 --> 00:16:32,329
card and it shows the planet then I have

377
00:16:32,329 --> 00:16:35,540
to find another similar one well if it

378
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:37,519
they are not similar nothing happens and

379
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:39,529
the same way I would play with paper

380
00:16:39,529 --> 00:16:42,170
that I have to turn the cards back and

381
00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:45,860
from I would turn them back again but

382
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:48,050
let's figure let's think I found a

383
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:51,199
similar one okay I know it's this one so

384
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:53,089
when you find similar ones it has this

385
00:16:53,089 --> 00:16:55,189
small animation saying hey you find me

386
00:16:55,189 --> 00:16:57,370
and then I change the background and

387
00:16:57,370 --> 00:17:00,410
well then you can keep playing it is

388
00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:05,089
responsive so for example if I change

389
00:17:05,089 --> 00:17:09,370
for like a smaller screen here it is I

390
00:17:09,370 --> 00:17:13,159
use a CSS grid to make another order of

391
00:17:13,159 --> 00:17:15,740
the cards so it's not Wrentham because I

392
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:18,079
don't have a random function in CSS at

393
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:20,329
this time but you can change the thing

394
00:17:20,329 --> 00:17:22,220
three different screen widgets and then

395
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:24,529
they change the order of the cards so

396
00:17:24,529 --> 00:17:25,850
you can play it again that won't be

397
00:17:25,850 --> 00:17:28,580
boring for example here is not it's

398
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:30,980
actually Venus and if you open it it's

399
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:33,950
in another position okay so now I'm

400
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:35,360
gonna cheat a little bit to show you

401
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,370
what happens when we play all of the

402
00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:39,230
game and we win please don't tell

403
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:42,350
one that I was doing this okay so I'm

404
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:52,160
gonna select all the cards okay done

405
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,770
I want again or it gets happy and say

406
00:17:54,770 --> 00:17:56,870
yeah you won and then you can refresh

407
00:17:56,870 --> 00:17:58,730
the page and play it again if you want

408
00:17:58,730 --> 00:18:01,940
it so this was made only with CSS the

409
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:03,350
drawings are the one from the solar

410
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:06,520
system drawing I show you earlier and

411
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:09,290
well hello let's talk about how this

412
00:18:09,290 --> 00:18:16,510
game was built any more technical way I

413
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:19,250
think the main question I had when I

414
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:21,440
wanted to do this game is how could I

415
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:24,470
create a click basic action without a

416
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:27,080
JavaScript event because usually when we

417
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:28,549
think about clicking things and

418
00:18:28,549 --> 00:18:30,290
interacting with things we always think

419
00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:32,780
about clicking with JavaScript depending

420
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:34,400
if you're using vanilla JavaScript or a

421
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,350
framework it changes but it's always a

422
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:39,830
kind of on click event the secret at

423
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:41,570
least for me on this case it was to

424
00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:44,450
combine label and checkbox because if we

425
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:47,450
think about your checkbox well it

426
00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:49,460
changes its appearance when we click

427
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:50,840
over it so if you click on the label

428
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:53,000
it's check if you unclick if you click

429
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
again it's unchecked so this allow us to

430
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,490
have a label and change the state of

431
00:18:58,490 --> 00:19:01,549
this checkbox and this is the move the

432
00:19:01,549 --> 00:19:04,880
beginning in China of this game so for

433
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:07,580
example each card both parts of the

434
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:10,309
stars and the planet are labels I've

435
00:19:10,309 --> 00:19:12,679
done the checkbox it's not visible

436
00:19:12,679 --> 00:19:14,419
actually so that's why it's a blank

437
00:19:14,419 --> 00:19:17,030
screen so it's hidden you don't see the

438
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:19,970
checkbox but there's actually actually a

439
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:22,100
checkbox for each one of the cards the

440
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:24,130
cards are a label for a hidden chat box

441
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:29,809
and here's an example of the code so we

442
00:19:29,809 --> 00:19:31,520
have an input this example is for the

443
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:34,070
planet Mars and then we have the label

444
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:37,250
which have two sections the first one I

445
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:39,320
call card front which is the place that

446
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:42,410
the stars go this each of one of the

447
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:45,559
stars it's a see HTML chip it's just

448
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:48,770
like a white point like two pixels I

449
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:51,700
think with some opacity reduced

450
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:54,220
and then there is the card back which is

451
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:57,730
just a planet and the text of the planet

452
00:19:57,730 --> 00:20:00,700
so both of them are on the label and I

453
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:02,679
just changed their visibility according

454
00:20:02,679 --> 00:20:06,519
to the checkboxes state so let's think a

455
00:20:06,519 --> 00:20:08,529
little bit more about the game logic and

456
00:20:08,529 --> 00:20:10,720
this is something I just realized when I

457
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,610
when I was creating the game and I think

458
00:20:12,610 --> 00:20:14,799
it's really cool it's allowed me present

459
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:17,200
this year I really like cycles so this

460
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,700
is the last one from the presentation

461
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:20,769
but the first thing that happens when we

462
00:20:20,769 --> 00:20:22,990
start playing with the car is that you

463
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:25,179
click over the car when you click on it

464
00:20:25,179 --> 00:20:27,309
they change both the checkbox we've

465
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:30,309
changed it to stay so if it was not

466
00:20:30,309 --> 00:20:32,169
check it you can check it and vice versa

467
00:20:32,169 --> 00:20:36,940
and then it will change the visible part

468
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:39,700
on the car but let's think a little bit

469
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:41,799
more about the step number two about the

470
00:20:41,799 --> 00:20:44,529
check box so there are different states

471
00:20:44,529 --> 00:20:46,330
they're different phases actually

472
00:20:46,330 --> 00:20:48,909
there's the first one when the when you

473
00:20:48,909 --> 00:20:50,889
start playing the card and all the cards

474
00:20:50,889 --> 00:20:53,590
are with the Stars showing then you can

475
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:54,940
click over it and it's going to show the

476
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:56,950
planet and also there is the third one

477
00:20:56,950 --> 00:20:59,049
which is when you click all of the cards

478
00:20:59,049 --> 00:21:03,639
and you won the game so the case number

479
00:21:03,639 --> 00:21:06,580
one it's when the checkbox get becomes

480
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:10,510
check it this is the cool thing if you

481
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:12,190
look at the code and you think how to

482
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:14,620
create a game you'd ended up trying to

483
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:17,080
use try to use conditionals such as a

484
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:19,929
else but there is no such thing in the

485
00:21:19,929 --> 00:21:22,779
CSS so how do we create a similar

486
00:21:22,779 --> 00:21:26,620
behavior if we don't have an if in CSS

487
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:28,659
because we want you click on the card

488
00:21:28,659 --> 00:21:31,059
and if the stars are visible we're gonna

489
00:21:31,059 --> 00:21:33,519
hide the Stars and show the earth or

490
00:21:33,519 --> 00:21:36,909
another planet so here's the code I use

491
00:21:36,909 --> 00:21:40,450
it to simulate this if which is I'm

492
00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:43,419
gonna when the check box first is

493
00:21:43,419 --> 00:21:47,139
checking then I'm gonna show the part of

494
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:50,350
the card which called card front so I'm

495
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:52,299
hiding this sorry I'm gonna hide this

496
00:21:52,299 --> 00:21:54,340
part the card front which are the stars

497
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:58,659
and then in the same case which means if

498
00:21:58,659 --> 00:22:00,429
the checkbox is checked

499
00:22:00,429 --> 00:22:03,669
I'm gonna show the card back part which

500
00:22:03,669 --> 00:22:05,300
are the planets witches

501
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:09,500
or and then there's the keys number two

502
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:11,390
which is the opposite it's actually

503
00:22:11,390 --> 00:22:13,730
going back to its isness initial state

504
00:22:13,730 --> 00:22:16,850
which is else if the earth is visible or

505
00:22:16,850 --> 00:22:18,800
the stars are not visible I'm gonna hide

506
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:22,790
earth and display the Stars which is

507
00:22:22,790 --> 00:22:24,620
just going back to the original state

508
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:27,410
which is not showing the card back which

509
00:22:27,410 --> 00:22:30,650
is earth and then display in the card

510
00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:35,210
fronts which are the stars and the case

511
00:22:35,210 --> 00:22:37,910
number three which is when you won the

512
00:22:37,910 --> 00:22:40,370
game you select all the cards you did

513
00:22:40,370 --> 00:22:42,230
right you'll play the memory game and

514
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:45,500
then both of the planets the similar

515
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,330
planets are visible in this case earth

516
00:22:47,330 --> 00:22:49,490
number one is visible and number two is

517
00:22:49,490 --> 00:22:51,530
visible then I'm just gonna make the

518
00:22:51,530 --> 00:22:53,330
background darker and include a small

519
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:57,980
animation and here it is so I think this

520
00:22:57,980 --> 00:23:01,220
is school because when I look about I'm

521
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:04,220
gonna explain this what I can simulate

522
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:07,690
is like well if oryx's check it and

523
00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:10,940
number two is check it then I'm going to

524
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:12,920
change the background color of the card

525
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:17,360
back so I think when we are using CSS on

526
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:19,580
our jobs creating website business

527
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:22,070
applications sometimes if we don't stop

528
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:25,130
and look at the selectors like this we

529
00:23:25,130 --> 00:23:27,830
just keep doing our CSS and we have so

530
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:30,350
many things sure it is the code clean am

531
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:33,110
i using new technologies and it's pretty

532
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:35,630
cool to experiment and look at the CSS

533
00:23:35,630 --> 00:23:39,230
in another way I think it's good and

534
00:23:39,230 --> 00:23:40,700
you're probably gonna use that on work

535
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:42,950
later maybe there is one way that you're

536
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:44,480
gonna need to use the selectors or

537
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,430
create something similar to an if and

538
00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:48,650
maybe you just haven't thought a lot

539
00:23:48,650 --> 00:23:50,630
about it yet you just didn't give you

540
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:54,830
time to do that and well I created this

541
00:23:54,830 --> 00:23:57,980
game initially because I wanted to use

542
00:23:57,980 --> 00:24:00,170
CSS grid and I was working a lot with

543
00:24:00,170 --> 00:24:02,450
sass but I really wanted to use he

544
00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:04,640
assess custom properties so there are a

545
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,650
list of few things that I wanted to

546
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:08,600
learn by creating this game but after I

547
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:10,430
created it and I started looking at the

548
00:24:10,430 --> 00:24:14,080
code okay we have a notification

549
00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:16,670
well I realized I learned more things

550
00:24:16,670 --> 00:24:22,250
than I was expecting so here's here's a

551
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:25,280
list so as I told you CSS grid because

552
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:27,320
that was the main point of creating this

553
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:31,640
game and CSS custom properties but I

554
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:33,170
ended up learning more about the

555
00:24:33,170 --> 00:24:35,840
limitations often for checkbox and do

556
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:38,210
HTML tags it's something that we use

557
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:40,700
maybe you already know but it's cool

558
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:42,940
practice and to explore it to its limits

559
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:46,310
it's nice to see what we can do with the

560
00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:48,290
checkbox because when we are using your

561
00:24:48,290 --> 00:24:50,990
lineup on our applications maybe we

562
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:53,990
don't don't see how important it is or

563
00:24:53,990 --> 00:24:56,660
how cool it is now I look at the

564
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:59,390
checkbox in another region it's cool and

565
00:24:59,390 --> 00:25:01,970
also animations and transitions with CSS

566
00:25:01,970 --> 00:25:04,250
I think animations and transitions is

567
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:06,350
something that is really cool to learn

568
00:25:06,350 --> 00:25:08,240
with drawings because you can animate

569
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,310
them and you can do crazy things with

570
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:12,770
them and it's really important to use

571
00:25:12,770 --> 00:25:15,830
transitions on your website but you know

572
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:17,900
if you include too much it's not good

573
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:19,940
but if you not conclude it it's also not

574
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:22,280
that cool so it's a really nice way to

575
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:27,170
try and probably I learned more I mean

576
00:25:27,170 --> 00:25:29,510
I'm talking with you so maybe I learned

577
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:31,910
also how she talking with people a lot

578
00:25:31,910 --> 00:25:35,450
lots of people I don't know so it was a

579
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:36,740
really cool experience

580
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:39,070
I created other games after that and

581
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:41,750
probably I'm going to create more in the

582
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:45,230
future but that's not all

583
00:25:45,230 --> 00:25:48,350
hopefully you are motivated to create a

584
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:50,990
drawing or a game I don't know I know we

585
00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:52,730
still have two more days of conference

586
00:25:52,730 --> 00:25:54,740
and maybe we have a lot of work next

587
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:56,060
week because we were in the conference

588
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:58,490
but when you have some time if you're

589
00:25:58,490 --> 00:26:00,260
interested you would be really cool if

590
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:02,660
you try to make one and make a list of

591
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:04,040
the things you want to learn and the

592
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:06,080
things you learned it's really nice to

593
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:08,480
see your progress and it's a really cool

594
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,550
way to learn more things because there's

595
00:26:10,550 --> 00:26:12,620
so many ways you learn right I mean all

596
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:14,630
any courses we can take classes we can

597
00:26:14,630 --> 00:26:17,390
talk to people and this is just another

598
00:26:17,390 --> 00:26:20,450
way that you could have fun with if you

599
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:22,370
were tired of other methods of learning

600
00:26:22,370 --> 00:26:25,070
try anyone try to experiment something

601
00:26:25,070 --> 00:26:27,580
try to educate something that you think

602
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:29,440
it's cool it doesn't need to be super

603
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,660
used it's super useful for business

604
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:34,300
application but it can be your

605
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:38,080
experiment your thing and that's okay so

606
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:40,330
if you ended up great and running

607
00:26:40,330 --> 00:26:42,400
that'll be so cool and if you do please

608
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:45,070
share it on your social networks and let

609
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:47,140
me know let's see some with the past no

610
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:52,300
because it would be really cool and here

611
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:54,160
are the links for the game so if you

612
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:55,450
want to play the game it's some code

613
00:26:55,450 --> 00:26:57,820
bang you can find me on hold pin but

614
00:26:57,820 --> 00:26:59,530
that's also this link so maybe it's

615
00:26:59,530 --> 00:27:01,780
easier to find and the presentation is

616
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:04,270

method of learning so please just try it
