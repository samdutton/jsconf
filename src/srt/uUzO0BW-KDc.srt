00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:13,050

hi

2
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:16,380
yeah so I'm here today to talk about

3
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:20,830
something that happened to me I arrived

4
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:22,720
within five months ago were for sample

5
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:26,920
and I mean while I was attended a

6
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:29,290
conference called Berlin music hack day

7
00:00:29,290 --> 00:00:33,190
which the purpose of it is to hack on

8
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:37,780
audio on the web or not but my purpose

9
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:41,079
was to actually find what could be done

10
00:00:41,079 --> 00:00:44,350
the boundaries of what can be done on

11
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:50,010
the web in what's related to audio so

12
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:53,950
Berlin music egg they happened I think

13
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:57,100
three months ago and I just sent my

14
00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:03,190
purpose to do some crazy as long as

15
00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:07,299
it was related to audio so that was my

16
00:01:07,299 --> 00:01:12,330
goal what did I do well I did an idea

17
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:18,130
about sorry I'm a bit too fast for my

18
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:21,009
slides but I came ketchup so what I

19
00:01:21,009 --> 00:01:22,869
wanted it was this is what we have

20
00:01:22,869 --> 00:01:26,859
currently on the web we have pretty

21
00:01:26,859 --> 00:01:30,340
recently html5 audio and by the way

22
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:33,429
still a bit buggy on many browsers and i

23
00:01:33,429 --> 00:01:36,909
wondered so we have all these audio

24
00:01:36,909 --> 00:01:38,350
capability all these graphics

25
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:40,479
capabilities on the web which is like

26
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:45,850
canvas css3 and WebGL and the SVG

27
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:48,700
and low whatsoever what's why is the

28
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:51,159
audio even on personal computers we have

29
00:01:51,159 --> 00:01:54,399
such advanced graphic cards and we have

30
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:58,209
16 beach 16 beats audio card on most of

31
00:01:58,209 --> 00:02:00,369
them it's it's like it's treated like do

32
00:02:00,369 --> 00:02:04,149
back it it's I don't know why well

33
00:02:04,149 --> 00:02:07,990
I want this you know I want to be able

34
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:11,110
to have this from the web browser and

35
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:12,940
it's too far French maybe I don't know

36
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:17,620
but why not so we have WebGL on the

37
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:19,240
browser now who could have a manager

38
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,330
imagine that

39
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:24,380
so you know this this is who knows this

40
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:27,010
whoever use this put your hand in there

41
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:32,450
one person man okay so this is adult

42
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:34,490
life it's it's a digital audio

43
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:41,060
workstation pretty good one and and yeah

44
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:44,630
and so I wanted to knock or so I'm not

45
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:46,160
going to do this in 12 hours that was

46
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,990
the time of the competition and music

47
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:49,340
out there but I wanted to do something

48
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:55,580
that resembled some advanced audio I

49
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:59,480
said to to search what was available on

50
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,970
the web what could we do more than just

51
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:07,030
play pause seek that's boring I

52
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:09,830
discovered some blog posts and some

53
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:12,410
things one of those was that we can

54
00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:15,770
actually like Romani played audio data

55
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:19,070
in this case we're off and put him as a

56
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:22,880
data URI on on the other tag so you can

57
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:26,060
actually do all the synthesis in this

58
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:28,640
way he just if you know to some DSP

59
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,280
digital signal processing you can do

60
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,019
that pretty easily but it's not

61
00:03:33,019 --> 00:03:35,989
versatile it's not flexible you can't go

62
00:03:35,989 --> 00:03:39,260
much further this was one of the things

63
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:41,660
that I found that I could use to do this

64
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:44,510
I don't know what projects i just wanted

65
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:46,940
to build something cool next thing i

66
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:48,709
found was the mozilla audio data API

67
00:03:48,709 --> 00:03:51,340
which is still a work in progress but

68
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:54,440
like the lead the the staff that had to

69
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,989
give to actually do something to have

70
00:03:56,989 --> 00:04:00,950
feedback the distance between starting

71
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:03,860
to guard and having that feeling oh this

72
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:06,110
is cool you know like the feedback loop

73
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:10,400
is was too big it has it expects that we

74
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,660
developers not like DSP programmers

75
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:17,470
implement everything on top of

76
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:22,790
JavaScript API so

77
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:27,060
after that I had something very no flesh

78
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:31,700
so I flesh without an option for me as

79
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:36,750
that's not a standard way of doing

80
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:38,550
things for me it's just avoid it

81
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:40,590
completely I don't know about you but I

82
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:42,420
think you're just gonna fight it I hope

83
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:49,250
you do so I found lost sorry

84
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:53,280
there's water to ring the wrong I found

85
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:57,540
a Google Web Audio API so this was like

86
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:02,130
instantly kind of the solution I thought

87
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:06,780
it was good for my problem and it

88
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:10,830
basically provides a way for you to

89
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:14,190
manipulate audio on a web browser with a

90
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:18,600
very well-defined API and the main

91
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,520
advantage of this epi over the Mozilla

92
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:23,340
one as I view it I'm not just advocating

93
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:25,770
by advocate just it solve my problems

94
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:30,240
quickly quicker it was that the common

95
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,520
things that you want to do with audio it

96
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:37,230
already implements it it already has api

97
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:41,820
methods written in c++ really fast for

98
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:44,340
you to do common things so the feedback

99
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:46,110
loop that i was talking about was

100
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:50,990
reduced to this size really small but i

101
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:54,570
forgot to tell it is it still has the

102
00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:57,600
option to actually implement your own

103
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,600
DSP algorithms on top of it so it has

104
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,460
all the advantages i really didn't need

105
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:04,770
it and i don't want to get knee deep on

106
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:08,420
that but that's that's what I went for

107
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:12,000
so that was it it was love at first

108
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,700
sight uh yeah it was really love at

109
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:20,250
first sight I got really amazed we did

110
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:25,980
and I for around 15 minutes I tried to

111
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:31,310
understand it as a whole but there was

112
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:34,169
some problems it is experimental you

113
00:06:34,169 --> 00:06:36,500
know and as you know an experimental API

114
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:39,390
which is still not a standard it's a

115
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:42,030
mess to understand and there's a dog

116
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:46,740
there is nothing well yeah that's the

117
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:50,880
hacking started ah and we're talking to

118
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:55,800
fuss so opinions please yes yeah okay

119
00:06:55,800 --> 00:07:00,780
it's cool thank you sir okay ah well I

120
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:04,560
tried yeah when I got angry I got

121
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,280
frustrated because i was on a rush right

122
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:11,280
I was only kind of programming contests

123
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,990
I wanted to do something quick and fast

124
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:14,669
I didn't want to do something well it's

125
00:07:14,669 --> 00:07:16,470
like the difference between engineering

126
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:18,870
and hacking so like we have Felix

127
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:20,310
somewhere that you gave a talk on

128
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:22,740
rejections but that like when you don't

129
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:24,060
have time you have to hack you don't

130
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:28,590
have to engineer and I got really angry

131
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:34,290
because it was so undocumented it was so

132
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:39,450
buggy it was really unstable in some

133
00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:43,200
points and it was not it was difficult

134
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:45,210
to understand if you want to just to

135
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:50,190
jump in just something uh well I was

136
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:54,890
really really really almost quitting I

137
00:07:54,890 --> 00:08:01,340
was hangry yeah but what I did was

138
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:03,750
thinking about what I was doing and I

139
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:05,850
had set his purpose of doing some crazy

140
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:08,760
or anything so I just okay I'm gonna

141
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:11,910
read this back for the fact i never read

142
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:13,740
the whole spec in my life at that point

143
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:17,520
it was kind of daunting to do it but I

144
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:24,610
did it it was damn it was really hard I

145
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:27,900
read the spec and it was really huge and

146
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:31,710
uh and complex and it was more than I

147
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:33,240
needed and

148
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:37,440
but in the end guess what it was good

149
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,940
for me I had a reference point of

150
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:42,810
behavior I knew that when something went

151
00:08:42,810 --> 00:08:44,940
wrong and it shouldn't I had that

152
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:46,800
reference that's what specs are for

153
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,260
right sometimes browser vendors don't

154
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:56,610
read them all right ah so I started

155
00:08:56,610 --> 00:09:01,430
hacking again after reading this Bank I

156
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:06,180
more successfully this time got really

157
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:08,670
productive I got really building and

158
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:13,380
trying ideas and what could be done so

159
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:19,950
after 12 hours of non-stop coding 12 red

160
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:23,089
bulls one night pain when back pain and

161
00:09:23,089 --> 00:09:28,260
like infinite size of frustration yeah I

162
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:32,540
got some feeling of satisfaction and

163
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:38,010
well I built this yeah it's called

164
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:41,040
outage at it and it was born he matured

165
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,180
the version that I'm showing you today

166
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:44,940
it's a bit more polished I was

167
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:46,740
committing until like some 15 minutes

168
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:50,820
ago but i'm going to show you what I

169
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:54,750
built what I this API in 12 hours of

170
00:09:54,750 --> 00:10:02,250
hiking I could be this so as adults I

171
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:04,230
where I also for some calls so probably

172
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:06,270
every hack that I do it includes the API

173
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:10,850
arica these loads sounds from SoundCloud

174
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:15,540
that's the waveform and you can crop

175
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:17,790
parts of the waveform into a new sound

176
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:20,990
and upload it directly to SoundCloud

177
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:25,230
without any fuss just native API so I'm

178
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:26,850
going to demo that I hope we are sound

179
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:33,790
but let's see you

180
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:37,260
okay I'm gonna play a bit of the first

181
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:43,320
part for you to the central solides

182
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:46,220
seafood Omar think you understood that

183
00:10:46,220 --> 00:11:03,290
why I talks a good signal on Star Wars

184
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:06,640
and research it the news more small

185
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:17,980
thing this is a result of course it's

186
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:20,140
not a music creation it's just sound are

187
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:23,350
not attending to the creativity part but

188
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:28,260
this is showing off what you can do with

189
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:34,970
Monica thank you

190
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:38,959
David last but not least I wanted to go

191
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:42,290
further I want it to be able to upload

192
00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:45,290
these results to save it so I set up

193
00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:49,310
that extra mile to actually put it out

194
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:53,329
to SoundCloud that involves sex I xhr to

195
00:11:53,329 --> 00:11:56,000
and generating your wave file with blobs

196
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,500
which was kind of a pain yeah for

197
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,300
someone that never messed some so low

198
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:05,000
level it was a pain but at some point I

199
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,230
got it right yeah I'm gonna do it got a

200
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:13,129
bloated sound out first gotta connect my

201
00:12:13,129 --> 00:12:24,949
count it's connected uploading should be

202
00:12:24,949 --> 00:12:38,160
there now let's check it out on my count

203
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:48,759
it is

204
00:12:48,769 --> 00:13:00,950
it's the same unfun

205
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:06,970
so after let me go back to my slides so

206
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:12,190
after this experience I really enjoyed

207
00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:15,070
it and I wanted to contribute to it I

208
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:19,060
wanted to actually tell you everyone

209
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:23,800
that we can do more with audio in the

210
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:29,080
web so I was in contacts for since since

211
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,610
then to do with the creator of the Web

212
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:32,680
Audio API Chris Rogers from google the

213
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:35,170
very very open to communication guy in

214
00:13:35,170 --> 00:13:40,000
very nice and he's working like crazy on

215
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,490
it to make it really really good for us

216
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:46,720
use it so that thing that I was telling

217
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,860
the frustration from starting out from

218
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:52,660
no dogs from everything it's actually

219
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:56,520
much lower now DVI is much better it's a

220
00:13:56,520 --> 00:14:00,520
more stable it's enabled by default in

221
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:05,890
google chrome now and i think you should

222
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:14,470
actually try to alright so wrapping up

223
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:18,490
is this how do you on the web is no

224
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:22,210
longer ghetto it was until very recently

225
00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:23,920
people don't just don't care about it

226
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:26,200
it's all about the visuals and graphics

227
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,570
which are really good but we have more

228
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:33,250
senses than vision and once this is in

229
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:37,930
place we have endless possibilities to

230
00:14:37,930 --> 00:14:41,140
do a lot of things so for example from

231
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:42,840
the single guys that were here before

232
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,950
with this api you could actually

233
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:47,860
implement something which is 3d space

234
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:51,130
Alicia are this worthless if you three

235
00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:53,059
displacement sound so we

236
00:14:53,059 --> 00:14:54,799
on sun on games you can actually

237
00:14:54,799 --> 00:14:57,289
localize what this sound comes from and

238
00:14:57,289 --> 00:14:58,819
objects in these each other's prepared

239
00:14:58,819 --> 00:15:03,889
for that and it should be standardized

240
00:15:03,889 --> 00:15:07,819
it should be cross browser so that we

241
00:15:07,819 --> 00:15:10,549
don't we don't want more API wars we

242
00:15:10,549 --> 00:15:12,679
just want something that we can use its

243
00:15:12,679 --> 00:15:16,359
radiance fast and it's available and

244
00:15:16,359 --> 00:15:20,169
there is some kind of a rumor I heard

245
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:26,089
that this API really really soon he's

246
00:15:26,089 --> 00:15:29,029
going to be may be available on Safari

247
00:15:29,029 --> 00:15:32,419
and on mobile safari these rumor i read

248
00:15:32,419 --> 00:15:37,609
in peterborough new blog so let's hope

249
00:15:37,609 --> 00:15:38,989
that that happens because if that

250
00:15:38,989 --> 00:15:41,899
happens it leaves Mozilla to actually

251
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:44,359
implement it as well and we have all

252
00:15:44,359 --> 00:15:50,239
this power everywhere so but still have

253
00:15:50,239 --> 00:16:00,529
order yeah as you know the we don't have

254
00:16:00,529 --> 00:16:02,869
access two microphones and then camera

255
00:16:02,869 --> 00:16:06,769
as right now from a web browser that's

256
00:16:06,769 --> 00:16:09,859
the web RTC API which is being developed

257
00:16:09,859 --> 00:16:14,719
and that's not us guys imagine that you

258
00:16:14,719 --> 00:16:16,729
have a microphone we have a stream of

259
00:16:16,729 --> 00:16:19,369
audio and you can no longer just

260
00:16:19,369 --> 00:16:21,979
manipulate the images you can manipulate

261
00:16:21,979 --> 00:16:27,379
sound live on any device if this inner

262
00:16:27,379 --> 00:16:29,959
if this guy gets analized sorry this

263
00:16:29,959 --> 00:16:37,250
went into

264
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:42,370
all right the one message that I want

265
00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:45,790
you to take from this talk is that stop

266
00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:48,220
thinking only in one sense of your body

267
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:52,930
we have more and need the web make it

268
00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:57,720
loud make it creative on the outer side

269
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:01,150
just unleash your creative potential not

270
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:04,450
only on what we already know but go out

271
00:17:04,450 --> 00:17:10,270
there heck around just do it as you've

272
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:13,600
been doing until now but applied to

273
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:16,209
other senses the mat the web has been

274
00:17:16,209 --> 00:17:20,440
too silent until now George Lucas I

275
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,940
think it would be really really happy

276
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:26,800
with this okay this is it I don't know

277
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:29,860
if I went too fast or too slow but i

278
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:32,230
want to thank to music and I'm willing

279
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:34,720
they certainly in this path of actually

280
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,750
appreciating that we can meet the web

281
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:43,060
and Chris Rogers create a web addict guy

282
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:46,440
not just by creating it but by being

283
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:49,570
really really open to communication so

284
00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:52,300
every problem that I had I could discuss

285
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:54,670
with him with a very different time zone

286
00:17:54,670 --> 00:17:57,490
which is difficult but can handle it to

287
00:17:57,490 --> 00:18:00,580
chance come to let me tell you my

288
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:02,890

one thing so yeah this is available

293
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:26,740
these are URLs this talk the audio chat

294
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:30,700
it up the source about me you can access

295
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:43,220

girlfriend's coming so high I like a

300
00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:05,830
comment so you had very good ideas how

301
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:10,300
to evolve this this API so idea I'll to

302
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:13,090
be bold you said you had very good ideas

303
00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:15,970
but I think you should you know

304
00:19:15,970 --> 00:19:18,520
standardization community is really open

305
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:22,540
so there are open mailing list as w3c so

306
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:26,230
so you should really you know push your

307
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:29,500
ideas true w3c to actually make a

308
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:32,980
standard yes so yeah the standardization

309
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:35,170
communities open to all the developers

310
00:19:35,170 --> 00:19:39,060
out there so I mean we're all the same

311
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:42,550
yes exactly yeah let me let me tell you

312
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:45,760
my this water so standardization on I'm

313
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,560
just going to talk about salvation of

314
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:51,700
this topic I think it should go rly

315
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:54,850
through a very simple way which you guys

316
00:19:54,850 --> 00:19:58,150
should try what best suits you it

317
00:19:58,150 --> 00:20:00,610
shouldn't just like listen to me and

318
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:02,740
saying this is the best one I'm agnostic

319
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:05,620
every time i see i know i've enjoyed it

320
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:08,140
seems to try selling something but this

321
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:09,680
solves my problem in

322
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:12,740
in really short time this was a solution

323
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:20,150
to my bro it maybe not for yours but it

324
00:20:20,150 --> 00:20:21,890
maybe not for yours but what I want you

325
00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:23,900
to do that that's what i said it's you

326
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:25,370
should go out there should hack you

327
00:20:25,370 --> 00:20:28,040
should try out experimental API as it

328
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:32,330
should move the web ford push the

329
00:20:32,330 --> 00:20:35,180
boundaries try and documented things try

330
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:36,880
out what's really brand new and

331
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,320
contribute to its development because

332
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:41,240
this is still being developed so if you

333
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,770
have an opinion on it you can actually

334
00:20:42,770 --> 00:20:45,890
change the course of it so yeah that's

335
00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:48,890
my opinion on this oh man yes oh man

336
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:52,580
dude that okay thank you another

337
00:20:52,580 --> 00:21:05,130
question there's a question here

338
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:09,370
do you do you intend to have a tool for

339
00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:14,380
mixing on some clouds too well dis dis

340
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:18,430
that I sure did this was a hack no it's

341
00:21:18,430 --> 00:21:21,970
was built just to impress people to that

342
00:21:21,970 --> 00:21:25,630
was a part of it but this is independent

343
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:28,180
from soundcloud i may develop this

344
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:30,460
further but just for the fun of it it's

345
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:32,740
not going to be a product in the anytime

346
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:40,970
soon yeah does that answer a question

347
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:44,890
what's your favorite song okay don't ask

348
00:21:44,890 --> 00:21:46,480
me I'm a techno DJ I don't have a

349
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:50,080
threesome the other fun tonight then
