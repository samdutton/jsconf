3
00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:08,099
so funny story yesterday I was walking

4
00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:10,290
down the streets of Budapest admiring

5
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:13,860
the architecture and I wasn't paying

6
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:15,839
social the cobblestones and I fell and

7
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:19,109
actually broke my arm no but it's okay

8
00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:20,400
because this is good because I think

9
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,470
people tell you when you're about to get

10
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:24,390
on stage like break a leg and I broke my

11
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:26,220
arm and I feel like this is gonna mean

12
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:27,210
that this is gonna be the most amazing

13
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:30,179
talk ever but I'm not here to talk about

14
00:00:30,179 --> 00:00:31,949
how clumsy I am even though that'll be

15
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:33,809
pretty funny I'm here to talk about the

16
00:00:33,809 --> 00:00:36,329
shady web and how we can use our CSS

17
00:00:36,329 --> 00:00:41,510
powers for good and not evil one second

18
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:45,239
all right so what we're gonna first talk

19
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:47,390
about how frustrating the web is today

20
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:49,710
and then we're gonna talk about how we

21
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:51,420
can be intentional about our strategies

22
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:53,280
that we use to make our web more

23
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,890
functional and then lastly some steps to

24
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:57,629
bring that back home and actually get

25
00:00:57,629 --> 00:01:00,239
your web more animated so first a little

26
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:02,820
bit about me my name is Heidi I'm an

27
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:05,430
American from Portland Oregon and a

28
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:08,670
senior a full-service agency called ear

29
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:10,830
I at Erie where we got the clients like

30
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:12,450
Nike and Taco Bell and some other

31
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:13,860
American ones they probably don't know

32
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:16,950
about and my twitter handle is here as

33
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:19,080
well my code pens so if you want to

34
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,369
follow me and ask me questions there

35
00:01:20,369 --> 00:01:23,909
please feel free but like you said I've

36
00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:25,799
been a developer about nine or ten years

37
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:28,530
and when I first got into development I

38
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:31,530
was so excited to learn everything first

39
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:34,380
I learned HTML and CSS and then I saw

40
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:36,299
that other websites had these cool

41
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:38,430
slideshows at these jQuery and so I was

42
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:40,229
like yeah I want to learn jQuery but

43
00:01:40,229 --> 00:01:41,700
then I realized that I didn't understand

44
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:43,500
how jQuery worked at all so I learned

45
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,899
JavaScript and then I wanted to use data

46
00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:48,720
in my site so I learned PHP and all this

47
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,479
was fine and good but a couple years in

48
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:53,100
I kind of realized that I didn't really

49
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:55,680
like anything I was making it was you

50
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,329
know they looked nice

51
00:01:57,329 --> 00:01:59,729
they were functional but something was

52
00:01:59,729 --> 00:02:01,380
missing and I realized that all the

53
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:02,880
other developers that I was following

54
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,770
we're doing some really cool concept in

55
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:07,740
some really cool executions and I was

56
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:09,929
like man what am I missing and I realize

57
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:12,180
that I've been focused so much on how to

58
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:13,250
do the thing

59
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:15,230
so they don't really think about why I

60
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:17,660
was actually doing it and I think this

61
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:19,820
contributes a lot to why the web is so

62
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:21,560
frustrating and I think that we're all

63
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:24,430
kind of guilty that this a little bit

64
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:27,500
for example this fell we happen to you a

65
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:29,480
lot you read a blog you're like halfway

66
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:31,430
through agreeing to the good meat of it

67
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:33,709
no some of those video pops up and it

68
00:02:33,709 --> 00:02:35,750
starts playing music now imagine you're

69
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:37,520
at work and your headphones are not in

70
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:39,470
and all sudden your whole work knows

71
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:41,240
that you're procrastinating not working

72
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:44,240
super frustrating my probably Lee's

73
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,860
favorite experience is if you're on a

74
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:48,290
mobile device right so you start you

75
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:50,330
know struggling through the blog and

76
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:52,190
then Olsen this ad comes up and you have

77
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:53,989
to scroll carefully to get to the top

78
00:02:53,989 --> 00:02:55,700
and if you accidentally tap a going to

79
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:57,200
another site and then you know you're

80
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,480
not gonna come back and this is so

81
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,700
frustrating and the problem is is that

82
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:03,500
people like us are making those

83
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,330
experiences we're the ones who are

84
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:07,640
guilty and you know developers get

85
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:10,970
really mad about that and I think I just

86
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:13,190
want to give developers the benefit

87
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:15,020
adult-like maybe they're not evil people

88
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:17,390
like maybe they just don't intend to

89
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:19,790
make these experiences so awful and I

90
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:21,799
think there's two things that happen I

91
00:03:21,799 --> 00:03:23,840
think the first is that we abuse new

92
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,970
technologies until more sophisticated

93
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:28,220
way of doing things emerges right we

94
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:30,350
like the shiny brand-new things and I'm

95
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:31,640
definitely guilty of this

96
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,890
when CSS animations we're starting to

97
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:36,200
get supported I was like ooh like

98
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,570
animate all the things it's like a party

99
00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:40,820
my browser but problem was is that

100
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:42,410
people weren't coming to the site so I

101
00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:44,690
was developing to like look at the cool

102
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:46,370
is that I was animating they were

103
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:49,070
actually there to do a thing and I was

104
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:51,560
just getting in the way of that the

105
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,239
second thing that I think happens is

106
00:03:53,239 --> 00:03:55,040
that we prioritize like business goals

107
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,130
and metrics over the user experience

108
00:03:57,130 --> 00:04:00,560
take pop-ups for example really common

109
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,630
used to get email acquisition and

110
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:04,400
there's a lot of blog posts to talk

111
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,590
about how successful they are right you

112
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:08,600
get like 20 or 30 percent more emails

113
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,290
woohoo

114
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:11,329
but everybody hates them so why are we

115
00:04:11,329 --> 00:04:14,000
using them well I think it's I think

116
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,980
that the illusion that you do get those

117
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:17,840
emails but there's actually a couple

118
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,970
things are happening you're getting in

119
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:21,950
the way of the person's tasks that

120
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:24,260
they're trying to complete and so even

121
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:26,360
if they go past your pop-up they're

122
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,050
going to be fresher

123
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:28,340
with you maybe not come back to your

124
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:30,680
site also people are gonna put fakey

125
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,479
mattresses in there it's gonna be like

126
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:35,300
fart at fart calm edu or whatever and

127
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:37,879
just to get past that because and then

128
00:04:37,879 --> 00:04:39,530
you know you have fake emails in your

129
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:41,960
list and then let's say they're nice

130
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,580
people they actually give you their real

131
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:45,860
email address when those people receive

132
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:47,379
an email from you they're gonna be like

133
00:04:47,379 --> 00:04:49,370
they're not going to open it because

134
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:51,199
they didn't really choose to do that in

135
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:54,830
the first place and so you've all seen

136
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:56,930
this quote before I think maybe like the

137
00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:58,879
million presentations I've had it but

138
00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:00,770
it's a really good quote good design

139
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:02,750
when done well becomes invisible and

140
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:05,180
that's because we need to get out of the

141
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:07,879
way of our users and let them create the

142
00:05:07,879 --> 00:05:10,069
function at hand so that's what we

143
00:05:10,069 --> 00:05:11,930
really want to talk about being

144
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:13,729
intentional and I think this is really

145
00:05:13,729 --> 00:05:15,199
important when you think about CSS

146
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:18,169
animations because a lot of times are

147
00:05:18,169 --> 00:05:19,819
used for decoration so is that getting

148
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:22,460
in the way is there even a use for using

149
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:24,770
animation at all and I actually argue

150
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:27,590
yes because animation is a really unique

151
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:29,780
way to make the user feel like it's

152
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:31,849
something that's in real life so for

153
00:05:31,849 --> 00:05:36,020
example this is Ryan Gosling he's

154
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:39,020
receiving some information pausing and

155
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:41,300
then shaking his head and without even

156
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:43,039
understanding or hearing anything that

157
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:44,659
he's doing you understand that he does

158
00:05:44,659 --> 00:05:46,610
not agree with whatever was told to him

159
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:49,039
now look this example from Striped check

160
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:52,190
out the user is trying to submit without

161
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:54,469
filling out the fields so in addition to

162
00:05:54,469 --> 00:05:56,330
just outlining the fields with red which

163
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:57,680
has come in practice it's actually

164
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,960
shaking like no and that's universally

165
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,279
known so it's helping the user

166
00:06:01,279 --> 00:06:03,680
understand oh I messed up I need to do

167
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,830
something before the submits and this is

168
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:10,310
because what happens when you're

169
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:12,020
reducing what's called cognitive load

170
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:14,150
and so kind of load refers to the total

171
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:15,259
amount of information your working

172
00:06:15,259 --> 00:06:17,539
memory can handle and so this is how

173
00:06:17,539 --> 00:06:19,610
this works every day you receive so much

174
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:21,169
sensory information and stuff that you

175
00:06:21,169 --> 00:06:24,229
can feel or you see or you hear and your

176
00:06:24,229 --> 00:06:26,629
sensory memory actually stores the most

177
00:06:26,629 --> 00:06:28,219
important information in your cognitive

178
00:06:28,219 --> 00:06:30,650
load but what can also happen is when

179
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:32,719
you receive so much information that

180
00:06:32,719 --> 00:06:34,729
your sensory memory can distinguish

181
00:06:34,729 --> 00:06:36,649
what's the most important and this is

182
00:06:36,649 --> 00:06:38,630
when you become really frustrated

183
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:40,900
and decisions are really hard to make

184
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:43,670
this awesome dude professor John sweller

185
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:45,620
actually did a lot of studies about

186
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:48,350
cognitive load theory and with that he

187
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:49,400
figured out a couple different

188
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:52,430
strategies to help create these

189
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:55,160
techniques to help people learn so three

190
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:57,170
of these strategies that we can use in

191
00:06:57,170 --> 00:06:59,120
the web our show-and-tell

192
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,950
connecting context and Collin responds

193
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:05,330
studies have shown that people respond

194
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:07,460
better to image and narration versus

195
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:09,470
text and narration this is why seasoned

196
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:11,120
speakers encourage you not to have a

197
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,920
giant wall of text on a slide because

198
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,330
the audience will attempt to read the

199
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:15,830
slide while listening to you it get

200
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:20,360
distracted here's an actual good example

201
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,850
of it this is a blog post about group

202
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:26,870
texting in a really crazy climate I'm

203
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:28,340
sure you understand that states are a

204
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:30,710
little frustrating right now so instead

205
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:33,170
of just having a blog post with you know

206
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:35,660
text and some images they're actually

207
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:38,630
showing group text to help incorporate

208
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:40,730
into that narration it really helps you

209
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:42,350
understand exactly what they're trying

210
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:44,090
to communicate a lot easier than trying

211
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:47,840
to read those blocks of text the second

212
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,060
concept is connecting context so let's

213
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:52,280
say you have a cat I have two and you

214
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,660
see it coming around the corner and also

215
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:55,160
it looks behind it real quick and

216
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:57,260
they're like oh god what is it and so

217
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:59,390
you start to create a mental model of

218
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:01,160
what you think is happening based off of

219
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,930
whatever you're seeing it's not based

220
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:05,060
necessarily a fact but you need to

221
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:06,470
inform yourself if they actually gonna

222
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:08,810
take next and so you might be like oh no

223
00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:10,550
is there a mouse even though it's just a

224
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:12,230
can cats are just weird they do what

225
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:12,760
they want

226
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:16,220
and this is really important for the web

227
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:17,960
because there's so many different screen

228
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:20,030
sizes when I first started making

229
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:22,310
websites is so awesome because it's like

230
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:25,280
800 by 600 go we're good but now it's

231
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,980
just impossible to create one experience

232
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:29,870
for one screen size and so you're gonna

233
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:31,640
often have a lot of stuff that's off

234
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,919
screen they're going to need to let the

235
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:36,979
user know that exists so these are a

236
00:08:36,979 --> 00:08:38,840
couple examples from Google material

237
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:41,030
design and in this first example you can

238
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:42,740
see that when the user taps on the name

239
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:46,370
it reloads a new page now this is fine

240
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:48,400
when it's just one into like one

241
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,510
situation like that but imagine if you

242
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:52,110
keep going down a rabbit

243
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:53,850
and you don't understand where you are

244
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:56,610
so in the second example which is using

245
00:08:56,610 --> 00:08:58,560
animation to help connect that context

246
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,300
when you click on the name is actually

247
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:02,880
showing where that content is coming

248
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,340
from and so you just already start to

249
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:08,180
know where you need to go back to in

250
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:10,740
this last strategy is called color

251
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:13,380
response so this is really important

252
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:14,610
because let's say you're driving a car

253
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:17,460
you accelerate and the car goes faster

254
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:19,410
you brake and the car goes slower but

255
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:20,760
imagine if you've never had an odometer

256
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,160
and how scary that would be because you

257
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,150
would press the pedal you're like I

258
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:25,950
think it's gonna stop or you know you

259
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:29,300
might be accelerating and this is really

260
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:31,980
important for animation because you can

261
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:33,870
really provide feedback so let's say

262
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:36,030
someone submits a form you can let them

263
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:37,790
know what the current status is the

264
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:40,440
outcome and then what the future status

265
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:44,280
is with using all these parameters we

266
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,890
can or these strategies rather we can

267
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:48,480
really start to make a more functional

268
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,150
web and so when we start to want to

269
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:52,860
incorporate these into our work and

270
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:54,630
making sure we're using it for good and

271
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:56,760
not evil we need to identify the

272
00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:00,090
problems that animation can solve so the

273
00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:01,710
first problem that we can solve is I

274
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:03,750
need to demonstrate the functionality of

275
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:06,570
a new product and I think oftentimes the

276
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:08,250
way that people approach this is they'll

277
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:09,630
either have like a video where you can

278
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:11,820
see all the different features or they

279
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,830
have a bunch of documentation in this

280
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:16,170
example by chase they actually have an

281
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:18,630
entire pop-up that blocks the navigation

282
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:21,090
and the content and even more

283
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:22,680
interesting and I would love to know

284
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:25,230
someone who works here they have a CTA

285
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:27,660
that says see a slide show like someone

286
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:28,830
would actually want to see a slide show

287
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:31,470
about more of the features but it's one

288
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:34,140
way to execute it now a better way to

289
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:36,540
execute it is to use animation and so go

290
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:38,970
ahead and play this is a website for

291
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:41,310
MailChimp but MailChimp does is a

292
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:43,170
software that sends email campaigns and

293
00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:45,930
they're promoting a new integration for

294
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:48,330
Facebook ad campaigns so as you're

295
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:49,860
scrolling down the page you can see that

296
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:51,630
they do have a video where you can

297
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:54,000
actually see the whole process but if

298
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,620
you're not convinced there they can

299
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:57,120
actually show you just little bits of

300
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,760
animation coupled with text to show you

301
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,170
what this functionality looks like

302
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:02,790
they're removing the non-essential

303
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:04,140
content and they're keeping these

304
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:05,490
animations really short so you're not

305
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:05,910
going to

306
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:08,940
there and watch the whole thing another

307
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:11,550
example is zoom care zoom care is

308
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:13,890
actually a convenient care clinic in the

309
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:15,780
States and so if you were to fall on a

310
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:17,220
sidewalk in the United States

311
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:18,840
you'd want to go to zoom care and they

312
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,880
would help you and so the way that this

313
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,410
one works they wanted to promote their

314
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:26,010
app app and as you scroll down you can

315
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:27,420
see that they're giving some like little

316
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:28,950
bits of information but what's really

317
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:31,710
cool is that they're actually fixing the

318
00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:34,110
mobile device and as you scroll each

319
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:36,180
different feature they go ahead and show

320
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:37,980
you in the app what that looks like and

321
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:39,870
this is really great because it's

322
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:41,070
breaking this content into smaller

323
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:43,410
digestible pieces and they're placing

324
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:45,480
the words really close to the animation

325
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:49,350
that demonstrates it so let's go on to

326
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:51,240
another problem I have a shopping cart

327
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:54,960
on my website and I think often websites

328
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,340
what they do is that you're on a product

329
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:57,900
page and you go ahead and add to cart

330
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:58,980
and then they actually bring you to a

331
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:00,930
whole nother page and this is just rep

332
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:01,890
t'v because they're not really

333
00:12:01,890 --> 00:12:03,930
encouraging to buy more products they

334
00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:05,520
might recommend different products but

335
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:07,860
still it's not it's not keeping you an

336
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:10,890
experience where as one of my favorite

337
00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:13,770
t-shirt sites once you go ahead and add

338
00:12:13,770 --> 00:12:16,530
to the shopping cart a drawer will be

339
00:12:16,530 --> 00:12:18,180
revealed and it shows you where that

340
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:20,010
shopping cart is located and then if you

341
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:22,320
go up to the shopping cart icon it will

342
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,640
actually close it again they have the

343
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:26,910
same animation on the menu as well to

344
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:28,470
keep it consistent so you start to

345
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:29,640
remember you start to learn and you

346
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:32,460
start to anticipate these actions let's

347
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:35,460
look a little closer at icons so when

348
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:36,570
they're inactive they're like the

349
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:38,640
standard shopping Hut icon that's very

350
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,380
recognizable same with the hamburger

351
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:42,120
menu but when you hover over it it shows

352
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,680
you the direction that it's going to go

353
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,630
and then when it's active and you want

354
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:47,820
to close it it shows you that arrow as

355
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:50,580
well and so those cues for interaction

356
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:53,430
are really important because it's your

357
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:56,280
not going to want to you want people to

358
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,750
understand where these things are thar

359
00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:01,110
off campus and the last problem that

360
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:03,210
we're going to solve I need to let the

361
00:13:03,210 --> 00:13:04,890
user know that an action is taking place

362
00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:08,460
behind the scenes and so let's say you

363
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:10,680
have a form submit or you're trying to

364
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:13,980
load screens in an app common thing is

365
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:15,390
to just create a standard loading gift

366
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:16,830
now this is fine

367
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:18,720
but if your process is going to take any

368
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,710
more than 4 SEC's

369
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:21,330
people are going to get so frustrated

370
00:13:21,330 --> 00:13:23,520
with you especially if you use a loading

371
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,320
gift like this because anybody who's

372
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,120
this Mac it knows what this means is

373
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:30,060
like the wheel of death and so you want

374
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:33,360
to make it a little bit more like a

375
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,100
progress bar right so you could

376
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,870
virtually visually confirm what's

377
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:38,190
happening behind the scenes so you can

378
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:39,630
tell them where they've been what's

379
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:40,800
currently happening what's about to

380
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,560
happen and according to studies it feels

381
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:46,170
twelve percent faster even if it is the

382
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:50,340
same amount of time another thing that's

383
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:52,860
been really like popular these days is

384
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:54,600
skeleton screens and it's interesting

385
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,980
because there's actually like

386
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:57,690
conflicting information about a lot of

387
00:13:57,690 --> 00:13:59,970
people think it feels a lot faster

388
00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:01,110
because you're giving a hint of the

389
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:02,670
content to come so you know what to

390
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:05,190
anticipate but some people find it

391
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:06,900
distracting because it's a new pattern

392
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:08,730
that's just starting to emerge and so I

393
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:11,250
bet that you know a couple months down

394
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:12,900
the line when more apps are using this

395
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:15,120
it's gonna feel more intuitive to the

396
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,720
user and it's gonna feel a lot faster

397
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:20,930
and so those are all really great

398
00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:23,700
executions of it but I think as

399
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:25,860
developers we have a hard time bringing

400
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:27,690
it back to practice at our workspaces

401
00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:30,090
and so for this next part I'd like to go

402
00:14:30,090 --> 00:14:32,040
over some steps that helped me bring it

403
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:35,460
to my work common challenges that I

404
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:38,070
think a lot of us have our time creating

405
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:39,740
animations seems really time-consuming

406
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:42,450
and often times they come in late in the

407
00:14:42,450 --> 00:14:45,030
process and we don't feel like we have

408
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:47,030
enough time to give it its due diligence

409
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:49,590
establishing process to create that

410
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:51,780
language between you and the designers

411
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:54,900
or any of the strategists can be

412
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:57,420
complicated and also skill there's so

413
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:59,430
much to learn and so many different

414
00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:01,220
options for it and it can be a little

415
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:04,080
intimidating so the first step is to

416
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,670
start the discussion about animation

417
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:08,160
early in the process oftentimes people

418
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,800
treat animation as decoration and so it

419
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,180
comes like at the very end like ooh we

420
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:13,980
should make the hover state of a CTA

421
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:16,530
animated or oh we have a form submit we

422
00:15:16,530 --> 00:15:17,760
should probably create an animated gif

423
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:21,090
but you really want to couple it as far

424
00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:23,010
in advance as possible but definitely

425
00:15:23,010 --> 00:15:24,030
after you start to talk about the

426
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:25,980
animation or information architecture

427
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:27,930
and start asking those questions like

428
00:15:27,930 --> 00:15:31,410
what can animation help solve the second

429
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:33,529
step is to use storyboards

430
00:15:33,529 --> 00:15:36,079
to brainstorm ideas quickly now this is

431
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:37,730
that pretty but this is a real thing

432
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:39,920
that I've used to be able to create an

433
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:42,170
animation what's nice about it when you

434
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:43,939
bring something to pen and paper is this

435
00:15:43,939 --> 00:15:45,980
disposable you don't get attached to it

436
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:47,029
like you would if you created a

437
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:48,889
prototype right away and it's really

438
00:15:48,889 --> 00:15:51,439
easy to a bunch of ideas out and to be

439
00:15:51,439 --> 00:15:53,930
able to work with others on it once you

440
00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:55,399
and the team feels really good about

441
00:15:55,399 --> 00:15:56,209
that

442
00:15:56,209 --> 00:15:57,980
you can go ahead and create a prototype

443
00:15:57,980 --> 00:15:59,959
or motion mock-up and that could be a

444
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:01,490
really good base of discussion because

445
00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:03,680
it's actually animated there's a couple

446
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:04,790
of different tools that are really

447
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:06,019
awesome for this

448
00:16:06,019 --> 00:16:08,360
the first tool framer and principal are

449
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:10,040
kind of more drag-and-drop so they're

450
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:11,089
really great for like standard

451
00:16:11,089 --> 00:16:15,589
animations and they have a lower entry

452
00:16:15,589 --> 00:16:17,209
point so like your designers can work in

453
00:16:17,209 --> 00:16:20,089
it as well however if you need to do

454
00:16:20,089 --> 00:16:22,249
something that's really custom you might

455
00:16:22,249 --> 00:16:23,449
want to look into something like green

456
00:16:23,449 --> 00:16:26,480
sock JavaScript which is amazing but it

457
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,470
is you know it does require

458
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:30,230
understanding JavaScript for me I just

459
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:32,959
like opening up a code pen and creating

460
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:34,670
a pen I think it's really nice to be

461
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:36,139
able to have all that code there and

462
00:16:36,139 --> 00:16:37,759
then to sit with the designers and

463
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:39,800
strategists and kind of noodle with it

464
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,540
and make sure that the duration is good

465
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:45,740
the timing is good etc the next step

466
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:47,480
once you guys feel really good about

467
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:49,430
where the animation is is want to test

468
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:51,589
test and test some more and there's two

469
00:16:51,589 --> 00:16:54,170
components to this the first is you want

470
00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:56,180
to ask people who have not seen the

471
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:58,399
animation before a couple questions one

472
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:00,559
is it legible and that's not even just

473
00:17:00,559 --> 00:17:02,209
text but like do you understand what's

474
00:17:02,209 --> 00:17:05,510
going on and second how does it make you

475
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:07,579
feel you can really understand a lot

476
00:17:07,579 --> 00:17:10,250
about if they're animation is creating

477
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:12,709
anxiety or is creating calm or how that

478
00:17:12,709 --> 00:17:15,380
feels by asking that question and these

479
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:16,640
questions are really important because

480
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,620
the more you work with animation the

481
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:19,880
more you're going to start to think that

482
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,740
it's too slow because you already know

483
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:25,250
what's gonna say and then secondarily if

484
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:27,260
people are you know not sure if they

485
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:29,090
want to animate something a B test to

486
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:33,620
validate those decisions v once you

487
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:35,000
actually decide to ship go ahead and

488
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,549
document those designs design design

489
00:17:37,549 --> 00:17:41,750
decisions in your digital style guide so

490
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:43,010
if you have a digital style guide which

491
00:17:43,010 --> 00:17:45,260
you should you can go ahead and document

492
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:46,820
those decisions in it it's really

493
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:47,740
important

494
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:49,480
when you do this to show what you have

495
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:51,640
done in what you've already tried and

496
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,620
you don't want to do that'll help

497
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:55,809
other developers in the future make good

498
00:17:55,809 --> 00:17:58,120
decisions you also want to provide code

499
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:00,039
snippets that include the duration

500
00:18:00,039 --> 00:18:02,049
easing and timing because that's going

501
00:18:02,049 --> 00:18:04,120
to help make the animations a lot more

502
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:05,679
efficient when they build new modules

503
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:07,299
and then you also want to establish

504
00:18:07,299 --> 00:18:10,450
naming conventions it's you know how

505
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:12,279
messy it can get if everyone's on the

506
00:18:12,279 --> 00:18:14,409
same page but especially with animation

507
00:18:14,409 --> 00:18:16,500
to create classes that are meaningful

508
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,659
will help a lot

509
00:18:18,659 --> 00:18:22,000
and then lastly keep learning and have

510
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,279
fun here's a lot of resources that I've

511
00:18:24,279 --> 00:18:27,190
used to help educate me and I'll be

512
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:28,270
putting these slides online so don't

513
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:29,770
worry about like keeping track of that

514
00:18:29,770 --> 00:18:32,110
and that's it for me
