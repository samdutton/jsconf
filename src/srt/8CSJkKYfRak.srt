00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:21,590

hi everyone and I'm sorry about the

2
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:25,100
slight delay in my starting I can't hear

3
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:27,440

6
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:36,920
brilliant thank you very much you are

7
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:41,360
like hi hi everyone and so I guess you

8
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:44,540
know why I'm not there so instead I sent

9
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:47,750
my hologram over I hope this will do

10
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:50,210
it's kind of like I'm there in person

11
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:52,820
right except obviously I don't get to

12
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:55,010
hang around with you the whole time and

13
00:00:55,010 --> 00:00:57,409
annoy you I suppose that's a good thing

00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,770
seems like it's been a pretty amazing

25
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:28,009

00:01:34,369 --> 00:01:36,079
really good at technology aren't we ask

29
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:39,020
programmers it's brilliant anyway really

30
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:40,909
pleased but I could come and join you

31
00:01:40,909 --> 00:01:43,430
guys because I kind of feel like you are

32
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:46,399
my programmer brothers and sisters or do

33
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:48,289
you mean to go forward and my slides yet

34
00:01:48,289 --> 00:01:51,439
and you know and I love sharing

35
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:53,859
programming stuff with people who love

36
00:01:53,859 --> 00:01:58,490
programming that's you guys right yeah

37
00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:00,710
i'm just going to imaginary ones go yeah

38
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:02,149
because i can't hear a thing it's

39
00:02:02,149 --> 00:02:05,960
brilliant and but before i talk a bit

40
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,340
about for what i'm going to show you

41
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:09,050
today some creative programming i'm

42
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:10,580
doing going to do some live programming

43
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:13,430
it's obviously going to work flawlessly

44
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:16,490
and before I do that I'm just going to

45
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:18,350
introduce myself briefly so this is

46
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:21,350
their creative JavaScript workshops that

47
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:23,090
I've been running probably two or three

48
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:25,430
years now and it's some something I love

49
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:28,220
teaching because JavaScript obviously

50
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:30,680
you all know you're the top p

51
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,359
in JavaScript but you've all been

52
00:02:32,359 --> 00:02:36,709
watching JavaScript's rise too I don't

53
00:02:36,709 --> 00:02:38,650
know to stardom in the last few years

54
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:41,659
and obviously in lots of the areas but

55
00:02:41,659 --> 00:02:43,670
the area I'm particularly interested in

56
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:45,829
is creative programming so of course

57
00:02:45,829 --> 00:02:48,230
you've got the obvious things like html5

58
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:51,889
canvas like moving dong elements around

59
00:02:51,889 --> 00:02:53,239
with steer since we've got all of those

60
00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:55,430
things and but there's also just the

61
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:57,590
fact that javascript is so damn fast

62
00:02:57,590 --> 00:03:00,379
nowadays right is ridiculously fast is

63
00:03:00,379 --> 00:03:03,230
brilliant so opens up all of these

64
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:04,849
potential avenues for creative

65
00:03:04,849 --> 00:03:06,470
programming and that's what I teach my

66
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:07,819
workshops is what I've been doing for

67
00:03:07,819 --> 00:03:10,700
years in loads of different platforms

68
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:13,189
and programming languages now of course

69
00:03:13,189 --> 00:03:15,769
taking all this JavaScript it's really

70
00:03:15,769 --> 00:03:17,419
fun time to be learning this type of

71
00:03:17,419 --> 00:03:20,900
programming it built into the browser so

72
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:23,569
the workshops spun off a website called

73
00:03:23,569 --> 00:03:27,049
creative jazz calm hopefully we will see

74
00:03:27,049 --> 00:03:29,870
now I'm sure you subscribe and follow us

75
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:34,010
on Twitter don't you know all right yes

76
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:37,579
okay good so I really wish I could hear

77
00:03:37,579 --> 00:03:40,790
you guys it's just it's fine we live

78
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:43,069
with these restrictions you'll be boring

79
00:03:43,069 --> 00:03:44,359
wouldn't it there was too easy anyway

80
00:03:44,359 --> 00:03:46,669
careers of Jess calm there's a team of

81
00:03:46,669 --> 00:03:49,579
us that posts all the fun things that we

82
00:03:49,579 --> 00:03:51,560
find on the internet all the fun

83
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:56,479
javascript stuff you know creative demos

84
00:03:56,479 --> 00:04:00,079
and the tests and games and there's also

85
00:04:00,079 --> 00:04:01,699
loads of tutorials on there as well and

86
00:04:01,699 --> 00:04:03,079
there's like I said it's a small team of

87
00:04:03,079 --> 00:04:06,470
us here at CSS comp earlier and Link you

88
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:08,629
would have met well head and she's one

89
00:04:08,629 --> 00:04:10,759
of the main people behind creative

90
00:04:10,759 --> 00:04:13,280
guess.com so strongly suggest you check

91
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,549
that out if you're interested and what

92
00:04:16,549 --> 00:04:20,479
else ok so these days I things be a

93
00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:23,690
digital artist and you know obviously

94
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:25,789
you guys are programmers but normally

95
00:04:25,789 --> 00:04:27,440
when I tell people this they think I

96
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,900
just do Photoshop living you know

97
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:32,720
obviously I don't do photoshop and well

98
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,949
I'll show you some of the things that I

99
00:04:33,949 --> 00:04:37,220
do here's a project called lunar trails

100
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:41,320
now I love this 70s game

101
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:44,020
an arcade game called lunar lander so I

102
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:47,140
programmed it in JavaScript and I put it

103
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:48,940
in an arcade cabinet you can see it

104
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:50,980
there that arcade cabinet is just

105
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:55,270
running a full full screen chrome put in

106
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:57,070
some physical controls so you can play

107
00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:59,710
the game now cool part about this is

108
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:03,130
that behind you as you play this huge

109
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:06,040
plotter this hanging V plotter plots the

110
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:08,500
trails of the past that you take in the

111
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,480
game nardone as you've seen the game the

112
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,760
idea is that you land your lunar lander

113
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:15,820
on the surface of the Moon so as you

114
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:18,340
treat as you move your ship and gently

115
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:20,320
try and land it on the surface of the

116
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,900
Moon this plotter will mark the path

117
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:25,090
that you took and over time you can see

118
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:26,830
all the trails of people that played the

119
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:30,310
game build up over time it wasn't just

120
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:32,200
JavaScript there was a processing

121
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,360
element and obviously the plotter itself

122
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:36,730
is quite a big electronics project

123
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:39,010
that's programmed with arduino i'm sure

124
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:41,380
you guys your guard Reno's doing is that

125
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:44,800
right I hear that right yeah our jury

126
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,780
knows are pretty awesome so the plotter

127
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:49,180
that I made there along with an engineer

128
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:51,550
called Paul straaten but the brains of

129
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:54,970
that clutter is an Arduino mega so now

130
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:56,590
you've all got our drina's i fully

131
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:59,680
expect you guys to be able to make one

132
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,780
of those names right maybe maybe your

133
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:03,520
second or third project maybe not your

134
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,280
first one take it easy to go it but it's

135
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,630
great fun I love playing with

136
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:10,120
electronics next project i want to show

137
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,610
you is this one called pixel Pyro's it's

138
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:15,580
a digital interactive fireworks display

139
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:17,500
the idea behind this wall we've got this

140
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:21,060
massive screen 50 foot wide we've got

141
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:23,830
infrared cameras that pick up version

142
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:25,540
and I'm projecting these orbs of light

143
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:28,360
onto the screen you can see as people

144
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:31,090
touch those without hands I'm using

145
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:33,430
motion detection to see where they've

146
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:35,560
moved their hands and if they find

147
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,180
notice and emotion then it fires

148
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:40,390
triggers of firework this is a bit

149
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:42,490
complicated this project is programmed

150
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:47,710
in C++ using openframeworks yeah we just

151
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:49,990
have the most massive projectors it's

152
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:51,580
absolutely ridiculous and we're taking

153
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:54,400
on tour in the UK for the next

154
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,009
what between September in September this

155
00:06:57,009 --> 00:07:00,280
um really super excitingly i'm adding

156
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:03,220
lasers so I've got to learn how to

157
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:07,660
program Labor's in the next few weeks be

158
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:11,289
easy right how cool is lasers next time

159
00:07:11,289 --> 00:07:13,600
I present remotely i'm going to send

160
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,210
myself a laser version of myself yeah

161
00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:20,130
yeah that's pretty pretty cool ok anyway

162
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:22,900
what's next ok yes so the thing that

163
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,990
this project our weight in your arms hi

164
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:27,580
it's so you guys you guys are awesome

165
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:30,310
right and think about these projects

166
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:31,600
that I've shown you and in fact all the

167
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:34,539
projects I do they're all designed with

168
00:07:34,539 --> 00:07:37,419
code so I mean obviously the web design

169
00:07:37,419 --> 00:07:39,250
communities come up with this brilliant

170
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:42,370
new idea which is designing websites in

171
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:44,080
the browser well that's kind of what I

172
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,810
do I design all of these crazy projects

173
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:50,590
in code sometimes I'll have an idea of

174
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:53,470
what I'm trying to attempt other times i

175
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:55,860
won't i'll just make it up as I go along

176
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:58,479
but it's this process this creative

177
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:01,660
process that as programmers as jobbing

178
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:04,780
programmers you might have forgotten you

179
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:06,370
know we all used to do this when we were

180
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:09,729
a kid we lose the little sketches and

181
00:08:09,729 --> 00:08:12,669
stuff we used to being created but as

182
00:08:12,669 --> 00:08:14,860
programmers I think a lot of our work is

183
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:17,260
like it instead of check boxes that we

184
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:20,590
have to take off one by one I love

185
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:22,889
getting back to that creativity that

186
00:08:22,889 --> 00:08:26,020
iterative process trial and error those

187
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:28,539
joyful the it's a really good fun way to

188
00:08:28,539 --> 00:08:33,070
program so you probably this message

189
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:35,589
like we're probably like us programmers

190
00:08:35,589 --> 00:08:37,330
were probably saying to all the desires

191
00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:39,520
yeah learn to code and we're being all

192
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:42,580
snooty about it but obviously and it's

193
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:45,279
well you know I I do a lot of web design

194
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:47,410
conferences as well but the designers

195
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:49,240
and I've been telling them to learn to

196
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,880
code honestly clave loved they've loved

197
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:55,089
me telling a month as the brilliant it's

198
00:08:55,089 --> 00:08:57,370
not just all about us telling them to

199
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,140
lend cage you know we've got to be

200
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:01,089
willing to meet them halfway so I say

201
00:09:01,089 --> 00:09:03,670
let's learn to get creative because in

202
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:05,860
some of the most enjoyable what you do

203
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:07,810
is when it's this

204
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:09,430
most creative process that I've

205
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:14,050
explained so let's do some codes yeah

206
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:17,710
live coding on a computer that's 5,000

207
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:19,960
miles away what can possibly go wrong

208
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:23,410
it's going to be brilliant all right can

209
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:25,240
tell you're into this right so I'm going

210
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:28,360
to be using at remi's jayus bin Remy add

211
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:33,070
you there it's remy in can't see him is

212
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:36,400
he there no I've seized property gone to

213
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,020
the other tool class that's fine

214
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:40,120
whatever Remy we're using Jasmine if it

215
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,770
goes wrong we'll just blame him shall we

216
00:09:41,770 --> 00:09:43,630
all right let's make it full screen so

217
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:45,430
I'm running the stairs been it's a bit

218
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:47,800
of HTML you can see there it's just

219
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:52,660
putting in a canvas 400 by 400 i've also

220
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:54,700
got gang reference that comes you hands

221
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:56,170
up hands up if you've done canvas

222
00:09:56,170 --> 00:09:59,830
programming before you yeah it's pretty

223
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:01,540
good fun isn't it what we're going to do

224
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:03,430
today at quite a few who hasn't ever

225
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:08,160
done any canvas before yeah a few of you

226
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:11,440
all right well why wants to do today is

227
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,140
just do a little bit of graphical

228
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:16,060
programming we've become so let's start

229
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:22,390
easy let's draw a line yeah exciting and

230
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:25,330
until you're excited it's really hard to

231
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:28,960
type with a slight delay so if I if I

232
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,820
make a mistake then just wave your arms

233
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:35,260
in the air and until I fix it oh it's

234
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:36,670
going to be really it's going to be

235
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:39,270
perfect okay so i want to draw a line

236
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:45,130
that starts at the origin and like that

237
00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:47,589
and then i'm going to do a line to let's

238
00:10:47,589 --> 00:10:49,870
draw it along and down side vision see

239
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:52,750
no we don't see any of that that line

240
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:55,480
yet until we tell the canvas to stroke

241
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:57,550
path that we've just defined there you

242
00:10:57,550 --> 00:10:59,980
go it's pretty exciting we got a line

243
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:03,070
yeah I can tell you're excited about

244
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:05,260
that are you guys are awesome right

245
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:07,600
let's make a line that instead of goes

246
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,459
down and to the right goes straight

247
00:11:09,459 --> 00:11:12,940
saves minus 70 we have a problem with

248
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:16,540
that now we can't see it off I of our

249
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:19,690
screen so one thing you

250
00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:21,430
do with canvas which is pretty fun is

251
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:24,610
move the origin yeah have you done this

252
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:27,420
before yeah G of you the entire

253
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:29,980
coordinate system so that subsequent

254
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:32,830
drawing actually is in a different place

255
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:35,040
so I'm going to move it two hundred long

256
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:40,720
380 down so now we draw our line it's in

257
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,760
the bottom pointing upwards we've moved

258
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:46,990
00 point to the bottom middle this so

259
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:50,980
what am I going to do with this well it

260
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:52,990
doesn't look like it but this little

261
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:56,260
line is going to become a beautiful tree

262
00:11:56,260 --> 00:12:01,330
I know it's pretty amazing that's of

263
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:04,200
course the draw a tree we're going to do

264
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,490
we're going to impressive function which

265
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:09,910
I love blows my mind okay so fun right

266
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:12,130
so let's let's let's define our function

267
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:14,440
well i'm going to take take it step by

268
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,660
step let's make this a function that

269
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:19,270
draws a branch and i want to draw a

270
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:24,460
branch of a particular length I'm just

271
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:27,010
going to indent my coach eggs I can tell

272
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:28,900
you're all getting a bit disturbed about

273
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:33,070
that yeah program must indent um and so

274
00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:36,580
now instead of just drawing a line minus

275
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:38,650
70 and a droid minus length right the

276
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:40,090
length of the barge that I want and now

277
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:44,620
when I cool then I can draw a branch as

278
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:47,650
long as I want 100 maybe or there's a

279
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:52,000
hundred or a stick with like 70 I'm just

280
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,070
getting a little delay every time I type

281
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:55,930
it comes back a bit later is brilliant

282
00:12:55,930 --> 00:13:02,710
right and so here's the scary bit oh my

283
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:04,870
god what if at the bottom of our branch

284
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:10,210
function we make another branch well

285
00:13:10,210 --> 00:13:13,390
obviously nothing happens even at loop

286
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:14,830
right it's going to keep calling itself

287
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:17,110
the thing with recursive functions is

288
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:19,330
that there has to come a time when it

289
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:20,690
stops cool

290
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:23,780
well so I'm going to find some condition

291
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:26,180
in this case I'm going to make or a new

292
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:27,800
branch I'm going to make it a little bit

293
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,750
shorter than the one I just drew so

294
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:32,390
after a while the length of that branch

295
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:34,550
will be so short I don't want to carry

296
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:36,800
on drawing more branch and so I'm going

297
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,570
to test if the length the branch greater

298
00:13:38,570 --> 00:13:44,610
than 10 then draw a child branch

299
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:47,780
indentation woes don't worry I've got it

300
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:49,190
covered don't worry everyone it's fine

301
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:51,620
and instead of just drawing it the next

302
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:54,230
branch 70 I'm going to draw it at length

303
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:57,740
time say point eight right so that means

304
00:13:57,740 --> 00:14:00,020
that our second branch will be eighty

305
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:04,490
percent of the length you can see that

306
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:06,560
all of our branches just stop at the

307
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:09,740
bottom and so what I want to do before I

308
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:11,960
draw the next branch is translate the

309
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:14,000
origin onto the end of this current

310
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,220
branch I can do that with translate now

311
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:19,310
translate is always relative to wherever

312
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:22,130
the origin is right now so if i move the

313
00:14:22,130 --> 00:14:26,450
origin up i minus the length then it

314
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:27,980
means that when we draw the next branch

315
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:30,220
it's at the end of the first branch

316
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:34,430
castle hook we have a beautiful tree now

317
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:36,560
which way is the screen is it this way

318
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:40,190
so that way i don't know which way never

319
00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:44,030
is it that way yeah yeah yeah I don't

320
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:46,100
know I can tell I'm a mirrored it's very

321
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:49,220
confusing right so now and in fact just

322
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:51,260
to show you what that's doing I've set

323
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:56,380
the line which to be the length / 10

324
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:58,370
there you go so you can see that the

325
00:14:58,370 --> 00:15:01,280
longer the branch lengths the the

326
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:05,470
thicker it is ok now we see I'm

327
00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:10,760
beautiful tree what do you think yeah ok

328
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:13,850
fur yet live it's gonna get even better

329
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:15,589
I know can you believe it it's going to

330
00:15:15,589 --> 00:15:18,380
get even better so now these branches

331
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:20,030
are all kind of a bit straight let's

332
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:23,780
make them a bit then d I know ok so

333
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:26,120
let's bend these up a bit right and not

334
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,740
as well as translating the origin you

335
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:30,530
can actually also rotate it and so I'm

336
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:33,379
going to rotate the origin well when

337
00:15:33,379 --> 00:15:37,459
use the canvas context command rotate it

338
00:15:37,459 --> 00:15:40,759
requires an angle in radians so if i

339
00:15:40,759 --> 00:15:43,849
wanted to do it's a 10 degrees in order

340
00:15:43,849 --> 00:15:45,739
to convert that to radians i need to

341
00:15:45,739 --> 00:15:48,769
multiply it by PI over 118 I'm sure poo

342
00:15:48,769 --> 00:15:52,399
what's that ah so hard to type from here

343
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:55,099
and so now every time I draw a new

344
00:15:55,099 --> 00:15:58,249
branch it's rotated ten degrees to the

345
00:15:58,249 --> 00:16:01,429
right i'm going to rewrite this function

346
00:16:01,429 --> 00:16:04,159
so that we now pass in the angle as a

347
00:16:04,159 --> 00:16:07,159
parameter so i'm going to change that

348
00:16:07,159 --> 00:16:10,699
tenth to this new parameter and then

349
00:16:10,699 --> 00:16:13,909
when we call Child branches I can pass

350
00:16:13,909 --> 00:16:16,549
in rotation of the next class there you

351
00:16:16,549 --> 00:16:20,179
go maybe I'll make it 15 a bendy branch

352
00:16:20,179 --> 00:16:23,809
okay this is not quite what we wanted

353
00:16:23,809 --> 00:16:25,939
how about at the end of every branch we

354
00:16:25,939 --> 00:16:28,909
draw two branches and we can do this

355
00:16:28,909 --> 00:16:33,289
just by copying that and pasting it and

356
00:16:33,289 --> 00:16:34,669
drawing one will look at that whoa

357
00:16:34,669 --> 00:16:37,309
that's not quite what I want to minus-15

358
00:16:37,309 --> 00:16:40,999
now one branch go much goes right now

359
00:16:40,999 --> 00:16:43,249
this is probably not what you expected

360
00:16:43,249 --> 00:16:45,139
to see right the problem is is that

361
00:16:45,139 --> 00:16:47,419
we're going to go all the way down every

362
00:16:47,419 --> 00:16:50,299
right-hand branch until we get the end

363
00:16:50,299 --> 00:16:51,919
and then we're going to go back one

364
00:16:51,919 --> 00:16:54,409
little bit and then back one again to

365
00:16:54,409 --> 00:16:56,329
the other left hand brush but every time

366
00:16:56,329 --> 00:16:59,059
we're moving the origin to the end of

367
00:16:59,059 --> 00:17:00,979
the branch that we're currently messing

368
00:17:00,979 --> 00:17:03,949
with so in order to fix that or what we

369
00:17:03,949 --> 00:17:06,500
can do is before we start messing with

370
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,569
the coordinate system we can save it and

371
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:12,529
then after we've done all this messing

372
00:17:12,529 --> 00:17:15,019
around we can actually restore it and we

373
00:17:15,019 --> 00:17:20,899
have our tree yay i'm imagining applause

374
00:17:20,899 --> 00:17:22,759
at this point I'll just I see you're

375
00:17:22,759 --> 00:17:25,819
waving as I guess that's a good sign how

376
00:17:25,819 --> 00:17:27,709
my day of time think I've got ten

377
00:17:27,709 --> 00:17:29,750
minutes left so how about we make this

378
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:33,159
tree grow and animates what you think

379
00:17:33,159 --> 00:17:36,350
yeah all right you guys are up for it

380
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:39,470
let's do it well the first thing we need

381
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:41,869
to do if we want to make our tree growth

382
00:17:41,869 --> 00:17:44,330
is cool if you want to animate it also

383
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:45,679
you have to draw it over and over again

384
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:47,660
I'm going to do it the old school where

385
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:49,430
the moment is in settings well obviously

386
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:51,490
you should probably use and

387
00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:53,630
requestanimationframe i'm just going to

388
00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:56,450
use this settings will call it thousand

389
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:59,060
/ 40 milliseconds every frame that means

390
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:02,570
it's going to get cold once 40 times a

391
00:18:02,570 --> 00:18:05,120
second so Nell and I find this function

392
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:10,460
loop you can see here I'm translating

393
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:12,500
and drawing the branch every time but

394
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:17,530
before I translate I have to do a save

395
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:25,520
and a was the end so that's our court

396
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:30,650
system doesn't get too messed up it's

397
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:33,130
really hard to code from so far away

398
00:18:33,130 --> 00:18:36,410
right and so now the trees getting drawn

399
00:18:36,410 --> 00:18:38,420
over there but archery you can see it's

400
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:40,430
not very interesting licking and I'll

401
00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:42,500
tell you what I might do just while I'm

402
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:45,080
showing you this um I'm just going to

403
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:47,090
call this loop function once to draw our

404
00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:49,970
tree once and I want to add a bit

405
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:52,010
randomness to this well I've got this

406
00:18:52,010 --> 00:18:54,260
random function that returns a ruined a

407
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:56,450
number between two numbers to going to

408
00:18:56,450 --> 00:19:00,740
pass in instead of an angle of 15 i'm

409
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:02,540
going to pass it a random angle between

410
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:05,360
0 and 15 and on the other side i can

411
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:09,830
pass in a random angle between 0-15 so I

412
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:11,900
trees looking a bit wise a bit rubbish

413
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:14,480
looking to be honest Blitzer I'd be a

414
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:18,020
bit more wideness in our angles getting

415
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:19,670
bit better but the other thing we can

416
00:19:19,670 --> 00:19:22,250
randomize shashi the length of the next

417
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:24,260
branch so I can make that between point

418
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:27,100
seven point nine maybe

419
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:36,580
I can't see where my cursor is so now

420
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:40,780
every branch is a random amount of the

421
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:42,940
previous part between 70 and 90 say you

422
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:44,140
can see it's looking a bit more

423
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:46,150
interesting looking now our tree is a

424
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:48,580
lot more kind of beautiful looking and

425
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:52,270
might just make it a bit shorter but the

426
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:54,490
problem is so now if you want to animate

427
00:19:54,490 --> 00:19:57,580
this well we have a slight problem in

428
00:19:57,580 --> 00:19:59,740
that well first of all we're not

429
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:01,510
clearing the screen every time so I was

430
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:03,789
just building up into a mesh let's clear

431
00:20:03,789 --> 00:20:09,490
the screen every time it helps at all so

432
00:20:09,490 --> 00:20:13,240
clearing in it the size of our cameras

433
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:15,970
so you can see that every time the tree

434
00:20:15,970 --> 00:20:19,390
runs it makes a complete round tree

435
00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:21,460
which you know it's kind of fun if it

436
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:23,320
doesn't really if we want to make this

437
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:24,970
tree grow we're going to have to be able

438
00:20:24,970 --> 00:20:27,280
to draw the same tree every time right

439
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,559
which is kind of really hard and crazy

440
00:20:29,559 --> 00:20:33,070
and I just saw that someone told me

441
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:35,520
there's 15 minutes left I've no idea

442
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,990
where he said that I think I've got ten

443
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:40,270
minutes is that right anyway type it in

444
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:43,720
10 minutes yes good okay right and so we

445
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:45,340
need to figure out how to draw the same

446
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:47,530
tree every time so we need to stop this

447
00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:50,250
branch function being a function that's

448
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:53,620
just cause a random tree to being a

449
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:56,169
branch object that stores they march

450
00:20:56,169 --> 00:20:59,380
what what data does our branch have well

451
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:02,590
it has um has a length of an angle so

452
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:04,480
that's part of our properties on this

453
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:08,230
list Oh wonderful maybe slightly nasty

454
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:10,000
things that you can do with javascript

455
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,929
is turn a function into your class

456
00:21:12,929 --> 00:21:17,020
definition no I'm going to make a new

457
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:19,360
object which is my tree and I'm going to

458
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,789
make a branch and it's going to be like

459
00:21:21,789 --> 00:21:25,870
six it's be nice i should probably turn

460
00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:33,000
a an angle as well and we're going to

461
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:37,090
probably well this is where at now you

462
00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:39,350
did what is actually an object

463
00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:42,140
it has local variables that scoped

464
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:44,210
within here called length and angle

465
00:21:44,210 --> 00:21:46,610
that's good that's what I need the other

466
00:21:46,610 --> 00:21:49,330
of the product I need for this branch is

467
00:21:49,330 --> 00:21:52,610
children there's no not before no store

468
00:21:52,610 --> 00:21:54,919
data for the branches I'm actually going

469
00:21:54,919 --> 00:21:58,910
to repay them here that draws the

470
00:21:58,910 --> 00:22:01,990
branches having some problems with

471
00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:06,380
latency oh damn it to that yeah it

472
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:08,570
seemed very hard to control the mouse

473
00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:11,960
from so far away I could cut and paste

474
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:17,750
that up there and and here instead of

475
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:19,880
just calling branch I what first of all

476
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:25,130
i'm going to make variable children i'm

477
00:22:25,130 --> 00:22:27,590
just going to say it as a property that

478
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:31,340
is externally accessible Hockeyville

479
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:33,919
area and now instead of just call it

480
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:39,350
branch i'm going to ask a branch object

481
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:46,460
to the children so it reads my type

482
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:49,700
there's like a half seconds delay or it

483
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:52,730
comes back so that's why it's a quite

484
00:22:52,730 --> 00:22:56,510
slick as usual quite see one side and

485
00:22:56,510 --> 00:23:01,010
got live coatings hard times her and so

486
00:23:01,010 --> 00:23:03,770
there we are right so I'm adding a new

487
00:23:03,770 --> 00:23:06,679
branch on to the children array it's all

488
00:23:06,679 --> 00:23:08,960
this stuff here and need to put instead

489
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,250
of just having there is this block of

490
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:12,470
code i'm going to put it into a function

491
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:17,140
called render and obviously i need to

492
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:20,539
then all of that stuff or i could tell

493
00:23:20,539 --> 00:23:22,820
you get nervous den for God's sake man

494
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:25,789
in dense right in the only thing i miss

495
00:23:25,789 --> 00:23:27,710
boring the cut the branch object that

496
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:29,690
were in but we actually need to check to

497
00:23:29,690 --> 00:23:34,330
see if it's got any children that it has

498
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:38,510
then we therefore each one of those as

499
00:23:38,510 --> 00:23:44,900
well so here we cool and i thought this

500
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:47,990
game last is lazy oh look I made a

501
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:51,500
mistake I made any mistakes this place

502
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:56,180
probably add a semi boom probably see

503
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:59,300
what else is complaining about missing

504
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:01,900
saw another missing semicolon well I

505
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:04,940
like putting my semicolons in so I'm

506
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:06,800
going to put that in makes me feel

507
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,990
better alright so now what we got well

508
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:11,720
we should hopefully have a tree and I'm

509
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:13,640
here instead of calling branch where we

510
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:15,500
should probably draw our tree no idea if

511
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:17,120
this is going to work probably made some

512
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:19,730
mistakes she notice anything wave us run

513
00:24:19,730 --> 00:24:22,310
it we run it and see what happens it's

514
00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:25,370
the same as we had before except this

515
00:24:25,370 --> 00:24:28,160
time that tree is getting drawn over and

516
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:30,050
over again but in exactly the same place

517
00:24:30,050 --> 00:24:32,330
this means we can now make this tree

518
00:24:32,330 --> 00:24:34,430
grow and I am running out of time let's

519
00:24:34,430 --> 00:24:36,230
do it see how quickly i can do it well

520
00:24:36,230 --> 00:24:38,720
i'm going to make a variable called

521
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:41,770
growth or didn't spell that right Oh

522
00:24:41,770 --> 00:24:44,750
fuzzy you know rvn seeing into this

523
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:46,250
computer by the way in case you're

524
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:49,610
wondering when i set the growth 20 in

525
00:24:49,610 --> 00:24:52,910
the render function every winter come on

526
00:24:52,910 --> 00:24:55,850
scroll up and i'm going to add a little

527
00:24:55,850 --> 00:25:01,370
bit to the growth ok grave plus equals

528
00:25:01,370 --> 00:25:04,700
0.01 and and here in i'm going to

529
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:07,340
instead of well let's make us a local

530
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:09,560
variable called Belin sorry about the

531
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:12,620
meaningless names i'm typing a bit too

532
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:14,900
fast to give it sensible long variable

533
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:18,050
names growth times live so down here now

534
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:21,080
whenever I retire if Claire to add to

535
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:23,990
length then i need to change it to be

536
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:29,270
then ok that's probably all now

537
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:33,020
hopefully ah I've done I run now

538
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:35,270
hopefully it should grow there you go

539
00:25:35,270 --> 00:25:37,570
it's growing it's great eyes not stop

540
00:25:37,570 --> 00:25:39,740
I've we have a problem everyone the

541
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:41,390
trees and stopping grown everyone that's

542
00:25:41,390 --> 00:25:43,850
pretty serious oh my gods it stop it

543
00:25:43,850 --> 00:25:48,680
I'll just going to need and i can see

544
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,810
you appreciate thank you only I could

545
00:25:50,810 --> 00:25:52,520
hear you would be brilliant so instead

546
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:55,100
of just adding point 01 to it I wanted

547
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:57,890
to ease towards under there's this and

548
00:25:57,890 --> 00:26:00,920
thick function you can do to make it

549
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:05,360
easier position I'm really running out

550
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:08,480
I don't even really have time to explain

551
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:13,309
this but I'm going to want it to ease

552
00:26:13,309 --> 00:26:18,110
towards one so now hopefully it stop is

553
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:22,610
it gonna do anything yeah it's I

554
00:26:22,610 --> 00:26:24,140
eventually stopped when i get that it

555
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:25,760
doesn't look very realistic the growth

556
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:28,010
so i'm going to iron you know I need to

557
00:26:28,010 --> 00:26:30,170
do i need to stall which generation

558
00:26:30,170 --> 00:26:35,900
wearing it's going crazy and then every

559
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:38,150
time I make a branch oh my god it's so

560
00:26:38,150 --> 00:26:41,590
hard to do this I'm going to score

561
00:26:41,590 --> 00:26:49,120
generation in a local variable there and

562
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:52,490
at the beginning I need to add one it's

563
00:26:52,490 --> 00:26:54,799
a generation and at the end of this

564
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:57,650
branch functional needs perforation

565
00:26:57,650 --> 00:26:58,970
really running out of time and the

566
00:26:58,970 --> 00:27:01,490
screen is it updating fast enough it's

567
00:27:01,490 --> 00:27:05,000
all going to so now hopefully I

568
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,850
should have a property called jen as a

569
00:27:07,850 --> 00:27:10,429
property inside of this inside of this

570
00:27:10,429 --> 00:27:13,010
object i can use to know how far down

571
00:27:13,010 --> 00:27:15,169
the generations I am I could use that

572
00:27:15,169 --> 00:27:18,110
for anything but at the moment i'm going

573
00:27:18,110 --> 00:27:22,160
to use up here to set a delay and i'm

574
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:25,010
going to set that to be gen x 10 and so

575
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:26,540
now down here instead of just adding

576
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:31,570
anything to the growth i can say if oh

577
00:27:31,570 --> 00:27:37,450
if delay is greater than zero delay

578
00:27:37,450 --> 00:27:44,750
minus minus up that's where i can make

579
00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:49,070
the growth eating my screen isn't oh

580
00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:52,850
there it is again sorry i would normally

581
00:27:52,850 --> 00:27:56,360
put on brackets so now hopefully that

582
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:59,690
the new is the branches at the end

583
00:27:59,690 --> 00:28:02,150
should grow last now i have absolutely

584
00:28:02,150 --> 00:28:04,940
run out of time I'm afraid and but there

585
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:06,710
is one here I was going to make its way

586
00:28:06,710 --> 00:28:08,630
as well but I've just got no time but

587
00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:09,950
instead i'm going to show you this one

588
00:28:09,950 --> 00:28:11,720
but i made earlier which is using

589
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:15,770
exactly a system but this has got it

590
00:28:15,770 --> 00:28:18,830
grows it also springs and it's

591
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:20,840
sways a bit look at this every time it

592
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:22,460
does it slightly differently and it's

593
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:24,559
called cool render style now this

594
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:26,600
awesome looking robo tree was a bit of

595
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:28,519
an accident really didn't mean for it to

596
00:28:28,519 --> 00:28:30,350
look like this I just wanted it to

597
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:32,360
figure out how I could draw a branch

598
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:34,549
that was fat at one end and dinner at

599
00:28:34,549 --> 00:28:36,559
the other end I got that system of

600
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:38,990
circles in there and actually I decide

601
00:28:38,990 --> 00:28:41,179
let's load about why frame is nearing

602
00:28:41,179 --> 00:28:44,539
yeah and then all over anyway huh this

603
00:28:44,539 --> 00:28:46,850
is an interesting i'm going to post up

604
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:50,630
all this code and tree I look guys you

605
00:28:50,630 --> 00:28:53,059
guys are awesome if only I could hear

606
00:28:53,059 --> 00:28:58,130
you I'd be amazing right so that's

607
00:28:58,130 --> 00:29:00,049
enough of the live coding they'll fact

608
00:29:00,049 --> 00:29:03,049
so the final a few slides in my

609
00:29:03,049 --> 00:29:04,460
presentation but hopefully that's been

610
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:07,690
an interesting example of the sort of

611
00:29:07,690 --> 00:29:09,529
discovery of these journeys of discovery

612
00:29:09,529 --> 00:29:12,289
that we can do so we're next if you want

613
00:29:12,289 --> 00:29:13,549
to do more of this type of thing we

614
00:29:13,549 --> 00:29:17,029
obviously as creative juice com also

615
00:29:17,029 --> 00:29:19,340
there's a book called nature of code

616
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:21,440
which is by Dan ship really really

617
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,659
brilliant creative coding is such good

618
00:29:23,659 --> 00:29:26,480
guy and what's mostly in processing

619
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,309
actually so is worth looking up posting

620
00:29:28,309 --> 00:29:29,659
to the loads of resources about

621
00:29:29,659 --> 00:29:31,789
processing but thans written a nature of

622
00:29:31,789 --> 00:29:34,460
code book which is pay what you want but

623
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:36,409
also is got a vimeo channel which is him

624
00:29:36,409 --> 00:29:38,769
doing all these videos of all these cool

625
00:29:38,769 --> 00:29:41,809
particle effects and graphics generation

626
00:29:41,809 --> 00:29:44,269
of generative art and all kinds of

627
00:29:44,269 --> 00:29:47,419
brilliant creative coding techniques if

628
00:29:47,419 --> 00:29:50,120
you wanted to come to the UK or europe

629
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:52,340
you could maybe come along to one of my

630
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:54,649
training workshops said dolly / training

631
00:29:54,649 --> 00:29:56,960
i am really trying to figure out how I

632
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:00,010
can make these available to Americans

633
00:30:00,010 --> 00:30:02,630
with the problem that i currently have

634
00:30:02,630 --> 00:30:07,549
of my visa situation oh well i brought

635
00:30:07,549 --> 00:30:09,679
you it it's fine when there's a

636
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:14,659
Holograms no problem so yes maybe follow

637
00:30:14,659 --> 00:30:17,769
me on twitter said underscore ly and and

638
00:30:17,769 --> 00:30:21,559
you can keep town forget with my visa

639
00:30:21,559 --> 00:30:24,769
application or also if i manage to get

640
00:30:24,769 --> 00:30:27,529
any more training stuff online hopefully

641
00:30:27,529 --> 00:30:30,390
you'll be else you know

642
00:30:30,390 --> 00:30:32,700
I mean the incredibly fortunate shouldnt

643
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:35,040
where been doing this creative Co stuff

644
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:37,740
and obviously when you start doing this

645
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:41,780
stuff you can get all personal projects

646
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:44,100
but the internet is a great place

647
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:45,930
professor put your some cooking cool on

648
00:30:45,930 --> 00:30:48,600
the internet one tweets about it and

649
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:51,210
shares it before you know it you become

650
00:30:51,210 --> 00:30:52,800
known for doing the things that you love

651
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:54,960
doing things that you do before in your

652
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:57,150
spare time eventually end up doing that

653
00:30:57,150 --> 00:30:58,860
for a living that's the position that

654
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:00,960
I'm in now very fortunate it's not

655
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:03,150
really any clients any Marge's work on

656
00:31:03,150 --> 00:31:05,100
way which is our art projects and do

657
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:08,490
these conferences and workshops and

658
00:31:08,490 --> 00:31:09,600
stuff but if that's something you're

659
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,250
interested in them you know you should

660
00:31:11,250 --> 00:31:12,810
be exploring this stuff i'm sure you all

661
00:31:12,810 --> 00:31:14,580
are you doing plane mode copters and

662
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:16,380
marjorie nose and all sorts right last

663
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:18,480
couple of days yeah must have been

664
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:21,860
pretty awesome so while you're all

665
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:24,240
excitable from the conference don't give

666
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,910
up go home do some personal projects

667
00:31:26,910 --> 00:31:29,400
don't just start the personal projects

668
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:31,290
finish them the reason people don't

669
00:31:31,290 --> 00:31:33,240
generally finish personal projects

670
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:35,820
because halfway through it just becomes

671
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:39,180
work right can I always take 10 times

672
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:40,890
longer than you thought so keep my

673
00:31:40,890 --> 00:31:42,210
advice would be to keep your personal

674
00:31:42,210 --> 00:31:44,970
projects on a small unbuildable and

675
00:31:44,970 --> 00:31:47,190
maybe finish Apple because if you don't

676
00:31:47,190 --> 00:31:49,020
finish project there's no point in

677
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:51,270
starting and so these are personal

678
00:31:51,270 --> 00:31:53,700
projects finish them stick them on the

679
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:56,310
internet that's kind of all the time

680
00:31:56,310 --> 00:31:58,860
that I've got right now I'm so sorry I

681
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:00,660
can be end that there in person I hope

682
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:03,090
this was the next best thing I've really

683
00:32:03,090 --> 00:32:05,640
enjoyed showing you some creative coding

684
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:07,650
techniques I hope that you're going to

685
00:32:07,650 --> 00:32:11,040
carry on well you know take catch me on

686
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:12,450
Twitter tell me what you can do and

687
00:32:12,450 --> 00:32:14,220
share the work you've been doing really

688
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:16,320
love to see it and maybe next year I'll

689
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:19,110
be there in person but until then I just

690
00:32:19,110 --> 00:32:20,880
like to say thank you so much it's been

691
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:36,200
great to virtually meet
