1
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:20,509

so um yeah I'm gonna present my

2
00:00:20,509 --> 00:00:22,669
aesthetical statically analysis tool

3
00:00:22,669 --> 00:00:26,300
alright whatever I'm Dutch so that's my

4
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:29,539
excuse my name is Peter I'm also known

5
00:00:29,539 --> 00:00:31,250
as cue files or q folks depending on

6
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:33,530
which context it's kind of confusing for

7
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:36,739
some people so I work at uz boo actually

8
00:00:36,739 --> 00:00:38,750
this is my first day today excuse ebu so

9
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:46,640
it's kind of cool alright so i built a

10
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,670
first i built a JavaScript parser and a

11
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:52,129
JavaScript parser is actually it's not

12
00:00:52,129 --> 00:00:53,929
that easy to do I guess at least at

13
00:00:53,929 --> 00:00:55,789
first it seemed like really difficult

14
00:00:55,789 --> 00:00:58,550
but it was fun I really learned a lot

15
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:01,940
and it gave me a foundation for the tool

16
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:04,550
that i built and it's really a challenge

17
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:06,500
you know i i'd like to solve puzzles and

18
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:10,250
this was a huge one the big problem here

19
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:11,929
is regular expressions at least for me

20
00:01:11,929 --> 00:01:15,970
it was when do you know when to parse a

21
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:18,340
division opposed to a regular expression

22
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:20,810
it's not it wasn't that obvious for me

23
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:22,790
it turned out later it was quite easy

24
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:27,079
but this is the main problem what do you

25
00:01:27,079 --> 00:01:34,560
see here is this valid

26
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,030
another number that's correct it's a

27
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:39,100
it's a regular expression / regular

28
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:46,120
expression right so my first result was

29
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:48,400
a sea of G portrayed uses the grammar

30
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:52,570
it's best specified in specification it

31
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:54,730
uses that as a source so I didn't have

32
00:01:54,730 --> 00:01:57,220
to bother myself with defining whether

33
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:58,690
whether I was parsing a regular

34
00:01:58,690 --> 00:02:00,250
expression or not and so I kind of

35
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:03,460
cheated that way for myself it put out a

36
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:04,750
concrete parse tree which was really

37
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:07,570
cool and it's really it gives you a good

38
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:10,090
insight into the language but it was

39
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:13,660
slow it's really slow i did jquery at 46

40
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:17,890
k in about 24 seconds that's not usable

41
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:19,959
i mean it's it's cool as a you know as a

42
00:02:19,959 --> 00:02:24,740
learning tool but it's useless as a

43
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:29,410
let's see the new resolution kind of

44
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:32,380
screw things up but this is like the

45
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:34,300
result that the concrete par-3 did is a

46
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:37,300
treatable so it will give you every step

47
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:41,380
that the specification would would you

48
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:43,510
know would would do if you would build

49
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:46,060
up the tree according to it but it's

50
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:47,290
used with you you don't need all that

51
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:49,330
information I mean it has for more

52
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:51,550
information i actually need so the tool

53
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:53,080
in the end is it's a nice learning

54
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,370
school if you want to know more about

55
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:56,620
specification but it's not useful as a

56
00:02:56,620 --> 00:03:02,380
foundation to do anything at all so then

57
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:04,330
a colleague at my at my previous company

58
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:06,610
said that help told me that parsing is a

59
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:09,130
salt problem it's not actually solved

60
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:11,050
but for intentions and purposes this

61
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:13,239
purpose it was solved it you could do it

62
00:03:13,239 --> 00:03:17,200
in linear time which means it must be

63
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,840
going much faster than my 24-second for

64
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,380
jquery so then at some point i changed

65
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:25,989
and i started from scratch and i wrote a

66
00:03:25,989 --> 00:03:28,150
handwritten parser which just means i go

67
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:29,709
literally a character by character i

68
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:33,070
created tokenizer to build a you know to

69
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:36,610
find my my tokens my identifiers my plus

70
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:39,820
my minus whatever that's only one week

71
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:41,350
of course that was one week after i

72
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:42,550
build the other parts which took me

73
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:45,370
about a month or two but the new parts

74
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:47,020
took me about a week it doesn't use a

75
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:47,440
grammar

76
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,980
read all so it's it has the problem of

77
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:53,380
of doing extra it accepts it over it's

78
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:56,050
over accepting so I have a lot of more

79
00:03:56,050 --> 00:04:01,450
education to catch soda partially became

80
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:04,210
the foundation for well you know its

81
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:07,780
foundation for several tools and the

82
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:09,040
tool that's the tool I'm coming two

83
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,240
percent right now I'm going to show you

84
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,520
it does what's index highlighting is I

85
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:15,670
guess pretty basic everybody has that

86
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:18,640
written nowadays it does a sort of form

87
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,709
of editing I you know I only did a tip

88
00:04:20,709 --> 00:04:22,270
of the iceberg on in terms of editing I

89
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:24,090
you know there's code mirror there's a

90
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:27,070
cloud nine whatever they do much more

91
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:29,020
than that I only did the simple basic

92
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:30,880
stuff that I needed to work with the

93
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,340
application there's ferry will look up

94
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:35,830
jslint kind of messages error warnings

95
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:39,220
and what type checking it's in the

96
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:42,400
browser and like I said it's yeah that's

97
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,300
not so easy to do because you don't have

98
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:47,620
assumed the things that should be simple

99
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:50,140
you know stuff like carrots when does a

100
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:51,430
carrot move you'll have to pull

101
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:53,710
throughout every time it's really

102
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:55,630
annoying and well I didn't want to

103
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:59,230
bother without myself so the layout of

104
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:02,050
the application is the top is a text

105
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:04,600
area which is invisible that allows me

106
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,640
to you know get the copy paste for free

107
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,470
undo whatever I don't sleep all of it

108
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:11,370
with that I know there are also

109
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:13,750
implementations that use text areas that

110
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:15,460
are off screen and so they have to do

111
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:19,030
the pasting copy basing themselves so

112
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:20,620
the bottom is then the content layer

113
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:21,580
which actually has the syntax

114
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:22,930
highlighting it's actually what you see

115
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:25,870
and in between is a carrot layer which

116
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:27,550
simulates where the carrot would be

117
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:30,850
otherwise you'll go crazy because well I

118
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:32,200
i discovered that it's really annoying

119
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,510
not to have a carrot you have no no

120
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:37,270
orientation whatsoever and then below

121
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:39,669
that is a marker which you will well

122
00:05:39,669 --> 00:05:43,810
will we become a parent yeah want to

123
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:47,260
help myself here another annoying part

124
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:49,930
which is not that apparent at first is

125
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:53,640
orientation of the carrot it's really

126
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:57,190
difficult to find your location your

127
00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:00,190
location in terms of an editor because

128
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:00,950
you have

129
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:03,170
and these tabs they're usually you know

130
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:05,930
eight spaces or four spaces whatever but

131
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:07,370
in the browser they're always eight

132
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:09,290
spaces except it's not really the case

133
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:11,060
because if you start with a space the

134
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:12,650
remainder of the tab becomes seven

135
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:15,590
spaces and that's I don't know I had a

136
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:17,810
hard time dealing with that on top of

137
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:19,490
that you know browsers do wrapping they

138
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:21,980
do styling they do whatever if you do a

139
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:25,390
fun both found in Firefox your entire

140
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:28,400
the entire text Scrolls down like half a

141
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,590
pixel there's all kinds of these things

142
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:33,230
you have to take account that was really

143
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:34,430
annoying and it wasn't you know it

144
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:36,650
wasn't really part of my my application

145
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:38,540
I just wanted to create an editor but

146
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:41,330
the problem is you need to sync the text

147
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:43,250
editor on top of what you're seeing the

148
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:45,830
text that you're actually working on so

149
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:47,480
that needs to be perfect in perfect sync

150
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:51,920
and so these little nuances you know

151
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:54,610
they became apparent the code is a

152
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:57,890
various levels of insight it shows you

153
00:06:57,890 --> 00:06:59,600
where you're missing you semicolons

154
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,820
which is something I'm not seeing in

155
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:04,160
most editors you know it some will give

156
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,810
you a warning like on the left hand side

157
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:07,670
but they're not explicitly telling you

158
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:11,060
where you're missing some ice when or

159
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:13,700
when or how you have used variables if

160
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,530
you duplicate them have you not use them

161
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:18,370
at all implicit global stuff like that

162
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:22,100
typing is that what it's it's it's an

163
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:24,440
implementation right now I have a better

164
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:27,050
idea on how to do it for next iteration

165
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:32,090
and and highlighting well I'll show you

166
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:36,470
in a few seconds it also does types of

167
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:38,330
properties so it will resolve every

168
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:40,640
whenever you have a variable and you use

169
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,920
a certain type of property on it it will

170
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,870
show you a list of properties and it has

171
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:47,060
resolved at some point so we will try to

172
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:49,670
match that it's not perfect and it

173
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:51,350
obviously has bugs and it's easy well I

174
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:55,490
can easily take that out properties have

175
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:58,250
types too so it does actually infer the

176
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:01,670
type of a property if it can it's I know

177
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:05,240
it's doing all kind of stuff out let's

178
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:10,130
see ya there are there's a few tools in

179
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:12,230
there like a mini far beautify it shows

180
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:13,820
you the entire forest or if you would

181
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:14,630
want to

182
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:17,300
and there's a problem navigator which is

183
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:21,440
a small menu so let me just get to the

184
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:25,910
meat of things this is basically the

185
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:34,729
tool which is crap alright so here you

186
00:08:34,729 --> 00:08:38,599
see what's actually happening and that's

187
00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:46,550
why I open unity so here you see an

188
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:49,720
undefined variable you you get the D you

189
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:52,490
on top of it which goes on a marker

190
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:55,040
layer here's a variable that's been

191
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:58,910
double defined the error up is the ETH

192
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:00,410
lend her a message that you should

193
00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:04,080
always declare your variables on top

194
00:09:04,090 --> 00:09:06,380
that's the years of prior usage so

195
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:07,400
you're using it before you're actually

196
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,990
defining it so you get a warning for

197
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:16,010
that and a shadow is no problem and

198
00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:17,420
you'll see that it actually doesn't

199
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:18,920
recognize them as being the same

200
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:24,230
variable scope look up def depth it will

201
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:26,750
tell you if you're using like a high

202
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:31,550
scope so it gets you two three four etc

203
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:34,070
up to 9 app 10 point you have a bigger

204
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:38,810
problem in I think so there's a tracking

205
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:41,120
object it will track every variable by a

206
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:44,990
generic a little globe global object and

207
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:47,360
so every time when your carrot is over

208
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,620
it it will highlight all the other

209
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:51,620
instances I guess not that fancy but

210
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:54,490
here's your demonstration of typing so

211
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:56,930
whenever you assign like a number or a

212
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:58,790
string it will know for sure for certain

213
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:00,590
that at that point it is in fact that's

214
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:02,630
that type I mean it must be there is no

215
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:07,250
other choice so it can infer that of

216
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:08,960
course I mean using the same variable

217
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,970
over so it will tell you all the types

218
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:14,450
that it encountered but at this point in

219
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:16,520
the code it must be this type there is

220
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:22,460
no other way it also does complex well

221
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:24,279
or complex

222
00:10:24,279 --> 00:10:29,079
as expressions and 4 plus is a rather

223
00:10:29,079 --> 00:10:31,149
complex one because it can either be a

224
00:10:31,149 --> 00:10:34,629
string concatenation or a edition which

225
00:10:34,629 --> 00:10:42,610
is a problem by itself let's see there

226
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:45,490
is a it does properties in properties so

227
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:50,559
you know this property has also is an

228
00:10:50,559 --> 00:10:52,449
object because you're trying to use the

229
00:10:52,449 --> 00:10:55,300
data on it so it's very likely to be an

230
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:57,910
object of some kind and it has the

231
00:10:57,910 --> 00:11:02,529
property of object which is I guess a

232
00:11:02,529 --> 00:11:06,370
silly name but let's see a pro raised

233
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:08,439
skype fusing because it's it can either

234
00:11:08,439 --> 00:11:10,149
be an object or an array and it doesn't

235
00:11:10,149 --> 00:11:12,370
handle that very well it will lock the

236
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:14,040
array part but it will also do the

237
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,259
object part because you're using the dot

238
00:11:16,259 --> 00:11:21,100
here it will do constructors in a well

239
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:23,470
somewhat limited level it will if you're

240
00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:26,649
using new or if you using prototype it

241
00:11:26,649 --> 00:11:28,779
will show you that you're using a

242
00:11:28,779 --> 00:11:30,509
constructor so it will try to do that

243
00:11:30,509 --> 00:11:32,470
but that's actually what I'm working on

244
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:34,470
right now this is not that perfect yet

245
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:40,649
same thing here it's a constructor yay

246
00:11:40,649 --> 00:11:45,250
it does some dead code will show you the

247
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:49,180
as call n bones sign if you dead code it

248
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:50,439
twice to determine whether you're

249
00:11:50,439 --> 00:11:52,269
throwing or breaking or returning or

250
00:11:52,269 --> 00:11:54,279
continuing anywhere and if you are then

251
00:11:54,279 --> 00:11:55,839
the remaining code must be dead code so

252
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:58,300
it's really simple one it doesn't do

253
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,980
through or false yet so you know if

254
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:02,050
you're using your through literal and it

255
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:03,759
doesn't know that the remaining code

256
00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:05,290
only of the other branch might be false

257
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:08,470
might not never be used so this would be

258
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:13,329
15 it wouldn't detect the fact that this

259
00:12:13,329 --> 00:12:16,980
never get reached

260
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:19,280
it also handles labels which is actually

261
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,380
quite difficult i never knew that labels

262
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:24,080
were dead complex but you can you can

263
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:27,800
break through basically anything if as

264
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,420
long as you use a label you can just

265
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:31,850
break back to any statement i didn't

266
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:33,260
know that it so that that became quite

267
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:37,610
complex here's some jslint warnings i

268
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:40,280
basically copied pretty much any of them

269
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:43,010
any way i could find anyways some are

270
00:12:43,010 --> 00:12:44,330
really hard to decipher because all i

271
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:47,630
had was the warning messages here you

272
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:49,700
see some errors so these are the errors

273
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:51,560
of the parser actually took and we'll

274
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:52,850
show you clearly that those who are

275
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:54,890
errors that simply can can't be parsed

276
00:12:54,890 --> 00:12:58,370
by the parser and assignment to a call

277
00:12:58,370 --> 00:13:01,990
for instance is obviously illegal oh

278
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:11,630
sorry I can't do right thank you so it's

279
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:17,560
basically that's that's what it is and

280
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:20,690
then over here you have a navigator is

281
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:27,530
that readable so on the right hand side

282
00:13:27,530 --> 00:13:29,030
you see how many times is a certain

283
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:30,560
error or a certain type of error

284
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,570
occurred on the left side you can

285
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:34,270
navigate through and on top you'll see

286
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:36,680
what kind of error there might have been

287
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:40,160
there the blue circle is an indicator of

288
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,530
where you currently are trying to look

289
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:46,760
at so I'm try I try to make the four

290
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:50,090
errors as as you know as a semantic as

291
00:13:50,090 --> 00:13:52,520
possible so no generic you're missing

292
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:54,830
this or that I whenever I see an error

293
00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:58,550
and I can refine it I try to which is

294
00:13:58,550 --> 00:14:00,530
it's not always that easy but you know

295
00:14:00,530 --> 00:14:02,930
sometimes it really just is and djs

296
00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:04,820
linds errors are just kind of cryptic

297
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:08,030
but usually it's it's kind of clear

298
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:13,100
what's what the problem might be there's

299
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:14,900
a min of fire which is really a basic

300
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:17,690
one it does does variable reduction but

301
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:20,440
not beyond that it doesn't reformat or

302
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:24,290
it doesn't reduce code when it can so it

303
00:14:24,290 --> 00:14:26,330
doesn't use new expressions your code

304
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:27,680
range the same

305
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,210
is there it has a beautifier which

306
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:31,010
apparently it doesn't like this code so

307
00:14:31,010 --> 00:14:40,690
of course a live demo as always I know

308
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:44,750
something like that you can toggle

309
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:49,640
certain certain problems or warnings or

310
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:52,070
whatever which was a been working on

311
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:54,110
that so it's not complete yet but I do

312
00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:57,170
mean to make it you know as complete as

313
00:14:57,170 --> 00:15:00,620
possible and you can see the parse tree

314
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:02,690
if you would want to but it's a big you

315
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:06,890
know just a big plane parse tree so

316
00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:09,380
that's basically it um you can find the

317
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:14,750
tool as you and jay has a calm and you

318
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:16,790
it's actually bookmarklet and you can

319
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:18,800
drag it into your browser and then turn

320
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,470
basically any text area in a website
