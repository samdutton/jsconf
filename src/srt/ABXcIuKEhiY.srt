1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,180

ah

2
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:13,500
so I have no audio and I have no

3
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:14,700
internet connection so it's going to be

4
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:16,560
a slightly different presentation and I

5
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,990
planned what I think I'm going to do

6
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:22,949
first is show you a little bit of

7
00:00:22,949 --> 00:00:25,590
processing j/s which is hooking into

8
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:36,360
WebGL so here we have is it takes big

9
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:37,739
enough will show make it bigger bigger

10
00:00:37,739 --> 00:01:07,310
bigger okay parents know what

11
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:14,260
how about that so good okay cool so we

12
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:17,500
have a basically this is Java syntax it

13
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:20,470
gets converted to JavaScript and then

14
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:23,640
runs a bunch of canvas functions and

15
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:27,670
WebGL functions so you have your setup

16
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:30,490
function and we're going to call OpenGL

17
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:33,490
and then the draw function and we're

18
00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:36,610
going to translate across the canvas and

19
00:01:36,610 --> 00:01:38,800
then we're going to have rotate why a

20
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,810
frame count is a global variable that

21
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:42,880
just keeps ticking over every time the

22
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,530
drawer is run and the door is actually a

23
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:49,570
loop and then the box which is the width

24
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:51,280
height and depth for the box or we can

25
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,380
just knock it down and just give it one

26
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:58,530
argument and it will handle that for us

27
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:01,570
there we go that's actually using the 3d

28
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:03,690
hardware in the browser on the canvas

29
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:07,210
and that's how easy is to start playing

30
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:10,030
with 3d with processing jeaious so it's

31
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:12,700
a it's a lot more tricky getting started

32
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:17,080
we have just JavaScript so you can do

33
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:25,510
things like color 250 500 which should

34
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:30,050
be red

35
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:35,809
excuse me it's Phil

36
00:02:35,819 --> 00:02:43,680
so we have a red box and that's this is

37
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,659
something I've been digging into I'm one

38
00:02:45,659 --> 00:02:47,670
of the guys hacking on the processing

39
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:50,280
Jas team and so we're at the moment

40
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,319
we're working on the WebGL part and

41
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:53,760
we're working on some audio stuff as

42
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,040
well to actually read the audio stream

43
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:58,769
in and write to the audio stream in and

44
00:02:58,769 --> 00:03:02,310
out of firefox and i'll i can give you a

45
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:03,389
demo of that but I don't have any

46
00:03:03,389 --> 00:03:08,489
speakers but i'll show you it anyway so

47
00:03:08,489 --> 00:03:10,019
what i want to show you something I've

48
00:03:10,019 --> 00:03:11,280
been working on over the last couple of

49
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:15,290
days and it uses a combination of WebGL

50
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:19,109
it uses a canvas 2d uses jQuery and

51
00:03:19,109 --> 00:03:22,650
jQuery UI to for the interface and then

52
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:25,500
i'm using some SVG filters to add some

53
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:31,730
effects to that so this is a WebGL

54
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:37,379
running at the moment and basically

55
00:03:37,379 --> 00:03:41,689
these sliders here I have control the x

56
00:03:41,689 --> 00:03:45,569
y&z properties and I'll just show you

57
00:03:45,569 --> 00:04:01,230
how I did that

58
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:10,250
where are we phottix

59
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:13,170
so I'm adding these hooks in at the top

60
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:16,660
rotation x y&z and then I give it a name

61
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:18,850
and I give it kind of variables that are

62
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:21,370
going to hook into jquery-ui well and

63
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:23,949
then a function for the slide event

64
00:04:23,949 --> 00:04:28,300
which sets the value and then the beauty

65
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:29,470
of that is I can have all these

66
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:30,940
different visualizations with different

67
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:32,860
hooks and you can add hooks and

68
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:34,090
eventually I'm going to make it so you

69
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:38,820
can hook 1 the output of one piece of

70
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:41,440
code to the input of another piece of

71
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,880
code and you create all these sort of

72
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:46,270
generative visualizations so I'll give

73
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:53,830
you a little demo of how that works so

74
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:56,080
I'm using SVG filters here and what

75
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,789
that's doing is allowing me to do to

76
00:04:57,789 --> 00:05:02,580
apply the blend modes like come like

77
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:04,570
multiply and screen and darken or

78
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:08,650
lighten if I do screen you can see the

79
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:09,610
other thing running in the background

80
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:13,539
which is a box and I can change that

81
00:05:13,539 --> 00:05:16,720
around as well give you an idea of how

82
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:22,850
this looks you do different things to it

83
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:25,389
and then I can switch these around as

84
00:05:25,389 --> 00:05:27,190
well and render them in a different

85
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:37,180
order and so then so I'm using SVG to do

86
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:39,310
that and you can't actually do it in SVG

87
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:41,680
at the moment in the way that you should

88
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,599
be able to do it what I've had to do is

89
00:05:43,599 --> 00:05:47,289
put both of the renders in one div the

90
00:05:47,289 --> 00:05:49,150
inside another div that has overflow

91
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:51,909
hidden then I've had to grab the SVG

92
00:05:51,909 --> 00:05:55,300
image and then slide it across and apply

93
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:57,310
it because you can you can't mix and

94
00:05:57,310 --> 00:05:58,830
match different Dom elements from the

95
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:03,330
CSS thing at the moment with the filters

96
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:05,770
so here's a little bit of control over

97
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:07,720
some of the filters this is a filter I

98
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:10,630
set up for adding some bloom which is a

99
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:14,710
typical effect in computer games so I go

100
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:16,780
that's the standard deviation just like

101
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:18,760
the width of the gorge and blur so it's

102
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,590
going for a gorge and blur and then it's

103
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:23,810
going through a component transfer which

104
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:26,389
basically what I'm doing is I'm upping

105
00:06:26,389 --> 00:06:30,710
the gamma and then I'm laying that back

106
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:32,750
over as a screen effect so you kind of

107
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:35,889
blend between the gorgon blur and the

108
00:06:35,889 --> 00:06:39,440
the original image and you can get some

109
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:48,950
really cool effects with this and so let

110
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:51,740
me play around with some stuff and show

111
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:58,700
you what it can do so this is a tree

112
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:00,740
visualization from the original

113
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:01,820
processing thing and it's cool because

114
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:03,590
you can then just dump all these

115
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:06,290
different visualizations into the

116
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:07,880
library and start messing around with

117
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:13,300
them to see what they do so if we take

118
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:20,479
let's see where we go let's try sad some

119
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:26,469
text

120
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:31,500
we multiply that these are using to do

121
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:34,949
three girls okay the two you're seeing

122
00:07:34,949 --> 00:07:36,750
at the moment it using the 2d canvas the

123
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:40,650
other ones were using the 3d canvas but

124
00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:43,680
it's using but the SVG stuff doesn't run

125
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,810
through hardware I think the filters are

126
00:07:45,810 --> 00:08:03,650
just applied for your software

127
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:06,540
and then here's an object I was messing

128
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:15,959
around with today let me just

129
00:08:15,969 --> 00:08:30,189
mr. Moser and that's running kind of

130
00:08:30,189 --> 00:08:34,089
slow the reason it's running slows

131
00:08:34,089 --> 00:08:37,569
because I am the way I've done it is

132
00:08:37,569 --> 00:08:39,360
i've done it inside the processing code

133
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,180
which is using evo and it's using with

134
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:45,550
so the code isn't traceable so when it's

135
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:47,949
going for all these loops it's taking a

136
00:08:47,949 --> 00:08:50,829
long time it would it's going to be much

137
00:08:50,829 --> 00:08:56,920
quicker at some point actually that's a

138
00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:02,470
good point i'll show you how to how you

139
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:05,939
can just make a 3d objects and export it

140
00:09:05,939 --> 00:09:25,580
if I do do strood faces

141
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:28,950
if I export this is blender 3d which is

142
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:31,980
an open source 3d animation and game

143
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:34,470
making thing which actually they just

144
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:36,150
they've just started working on a

145
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:37,920
plug-in so you can export from blender

146
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:41,100
3d you can export to WebGL so we'll run

147
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:43,590
on the 3d cameras which is really cool

148
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:46,050
so you can I think they're going to go

149
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:47,310
and extend it to the point where you can

150
00:09:47,310 --> 00:10:11,900
actually make games with that so

151
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:17,380
it's going to be test object so I'm

152
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:18,700
using wave front here because it's a

153
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:23,110
really quick and easy format to to

154
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:41,050
render so hopefully I go into object

155
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:50,910
up here I'm loading the objects so I'm

156
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:56,490
going to load in test the object here's

157
00:10:56,490 --> 00:11:11,129
why slow code is it be

158
00:11:11,139 --> 00:11:21,000
so hopefully this should work

159
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:40,639
here we go straight into the canvas

160
00:11:40,649 --> 00:11:46,420
so one more thing I'd like to show you

161
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:49,720
is the audio if i put the audio thing in

162
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:53,320
here we have two boxes which are going

163
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,589
to respond to this audio element and

164
00:11:55,589 --> 00:11:59,490
this isn't sort of plan to be in any

165
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:02,199
releases anytime soon but it's something

166
00:12:02,199 --> 00:12:03,760
that we're working on in the processing

167
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:08,699
j/s channel Dave Humphrey has done the

168
00:12:08,699 --> 00:12:12,519
the adding the hooks between c and java

169
00:12:12,519 --> 00:12:14,320
script and then the rest of us have been

170
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:17,550
hacking together and making demos and

171
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:22,449
writing beat detection code so for play

172
00:12:22,449 --> 00:12:24,820
this this is actually doing beat

173
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:29,860
detection right now so it's listening to

174
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:31,180
the samples of the audio it's getting

175
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:33,399
them into an array and then it's just

176
00:12:33,399 --> 00:12:36,519
processing the array looking for the low

177
00:12:36,519 --> 00:12:41,829
frequency and then it creates an object

178
00:12:41,829 --> 00:12:44,019
which you can query and find out which

179
00:12:44,019 --> 00:12:49,209
beat you're on so three it is

180
00:12:49,209 --> 00:12:52,630
interesting to kind of play around and

181
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:54,370
merge these different technologies into

182
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:56,290
one sort of interface for sort of

183
00:12:56,290 --> 00:12:59,800
testing purposes just to have fun with

184
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:05,649
it see what could come about so that's

185
00:13:05,649 --> 00:13:12,370
about it any questions

186
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:16,589
enjoy so you running your own machine so

187
00:13:16,589 --> 00:13:21,180
which is heavy how slow with BR a

188
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:24,810
regular gene it's not it's a lot slower

189
00:13:24,810 --> 00:13:27,390
on my laptop and my laptop's kind of

190
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:30,990
crummy though the WebGL stuffs really

191
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:33,240
quick the thing that's really hitting

192
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:35,760
the performance is having the two

193
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,250
different layers and then doing all the

194
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:40,680
SVG filters are nice that seems to be

195
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:44,520
slowing it down a lot is the hardware

196
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,589
acceleration stuff that's coming into

197
00:13:46,589 --> 00:13:48,510
Firefox gonna give up the performance of

198
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:50,730
this thing sorry is that the hardware

199
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:52,020
acceleration is committed to Firefox

200
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:54,029
gonna how about with this the

201
00:13:54,029 --> 00:13:57,450
performance of this sort of work the

202
00:13:57,450 --> 00:14:01,250
witch stuff I thought that we're getting

203
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:04,410
hardware accelerated graphics like I 9

204
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:05,190
is

205
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:09,190
for 2d or 3d as well I don't know well

206
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:10,450
this is actually free d and this is

207
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:14,200
hardware accelerated okay into he's not

208
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,720
currently available i I'm imagining it

209
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,930
must it must go them of it at some point

210
00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:32,310
yeah any more questions
