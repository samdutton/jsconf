00:00:37,719 --> 00:00:42,710

everybody thanks for having me my

2
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:45,230
mission today is to walk you two through

3
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:50,510
a bit of code to implement a vendre in

4
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:53,960
JavaScript and as just said it's kind of

5
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:55,309
the best thing that I bounced already

6
00:00:55,309 --> 00:00:58,309
does so why would we be doing this let's

7
00:00:58,309 --> 00:01:02,499
say for now we just we just want to so a

8
00:01:02,499 --> 00:01:05,689
bit more detail what do we want to do

9
00:01:05,689 --> 00:01:10,939
today um so we want to misuse a few new

10
00:01:10,939 --> 00:01:12,860
browser features that came up with html5

11
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:15,470
and stuff I want to use a bit JavaScript

12
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:19,700
to manipulate SVG HTML CSS DOM and the

13
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:24,740
CSS object model in any order so I hope

14
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:26,170
you guys have some fun on the way i

15
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:29,930
seriously had a lot of fun doing this so

16
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:34,399
um a bit more detail so what we want to

17
00:01:34,399 --> 00:01:36,229
do is we want to trigger the HTML

18
00:01:36,229 --> 00:01:37,759
rendering capabilities of the browser

19
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:40,759
from javascript so that basically what

20
00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:42,680
the browser is doing at its best is it

21
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:45,289
just takes HTML and shows us to us in a

22
00:01:45,289 --> 00:01:47,869
nice way what I want to do is get a

23
00:01:47,869 --> 00:01:50,630
screenshot from a random webpage oh it's

24
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:53,750
not so random but and actually render

25
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:56,180
HTML in the canvas or in other words

26
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:58,909
basically implementing a prolly fill

27
00:01:58,909 --> 00:02:01,820
which is kind of filling a gap that has

28
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:03,799
not been defined by a standards body

29
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:06,020
it's not there but I still think this

30
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:08,780
gap is needs filling and this is how it

31
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:10,250
looks like it's basically just canvas

32
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:13,849
get context droid tml that's what I want

33
00:02:13,849 --> 00:02:15,860
to do it looks pretty easy does it

34
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:20,510
so let's see so those very quick

35
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:24,290
solution of Firefox gratefully offers an

36
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:27,080
API to that basically all you do is get

37
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:29,660
a canvas get the context and you draw a

38
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:33,140
window to that canvas or that's

39
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:36,100
basically what I want to do right

40
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:39,470
there's about two that it only works as

41
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:41,750
a plug-in in Firefox so if you are

42
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:43,459
plug-in you allow to you make use of

43
00:02:43,459 --> 00:02:47,120
that from the web page you do not you do

44
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,570
not you do not go through that so you

45
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:54,080
have to you have to be a plug-in this of

46
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,080
course is due to security concerns so if

47
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:59,239
the browser would allow you to render a

48
00:02:59,239 --> 00:03:02,600
random web page you could just go just

49
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:05,959
like painter the open gmail tab of your

50
00:03:05,959 --> 00:03:08,239
user rendered to the canvas and then

51
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:09,890
read back from it and that would allow

52
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:13,280
us to get content that we're not allowed

53
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,370
to see so of course that is forbidden

54
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:20,150
and yeah that's not that's not bringing

55
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:24,440
us further so let's see so maybe SVG can

56
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:28,130
help us here the if you guys know canvas

57
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:29,930
the canvas does allow me to draw an

58
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:33,110
image well SVG is an image right so

59
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:35,120
let's see whether we can move forward to

60
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,930
that so maybe I don't know how public

61
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:40,700
that knowledge is but SVG does allow you

62
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:45,680
to embed foreign objects SVG is XML it

63
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,570
does allow anything it does allow other

64
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:49,820
contexts that all can also be XML and

65
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:53,780
for example it could be HTML or actually

66
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:56,450
a XHTML so the example that you can see

67
00:03:56,450 --> 00:03:59,750
here i hope the font is big enough it's

68
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:02,060
basically just a strong element inside

69
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:04,040
HTML inside a foreign object in an SVG

70
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:07,280
and that is a valid image can we build

71
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,750
on that let's see um well first of all

72
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:15,190
what is X HTML so SVG as an XML standard

73
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:17,870
can only m-matt foreign objects that are

74
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:21,560
valid XML wall html5 goes to great

75
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,360
lengths of allowing you to do whatever

76
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,570
you want and still make it look pretty

77
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:28,610
that doesn't work well with SVG so

78
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:29,830
here's a bit of code

79
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:32,290
basically creates a document puts in

80
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:34,720
some HTML then Oh provides some XML

81
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,240
namespace ting and then figures the the

82
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,280
Firefox external serializer to civilize

83
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,530
that back to back to us and that is then

84
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:44,200
valid XML this does not work in chrome

85
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,150
and safari because basically what those

86
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:47,830
guys are saying is the external

87
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:50,740
serializer by stand by the standard only

88
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:54,130
needs to serialize xml so anyway that's

89
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:55,900
a shim I wrote for that which is

90
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:57,430
basically a hundred fifty lines of code

91
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:59,170
it's not that difficult but we need to

92
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:00,280
fall back to a pure JavaScript

93
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:04,300
implementation for that browser so a

94
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:08,080
second step needed um if I want to show

95
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,150
the SVG as an image i need to inline

96
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:12,250
this so the new the future way of doing

97
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:14,260
that you guys possibly have seen come

98
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:16,420
come across the blog interface so

99
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:18,550
basically you create a blob put that SVG

100
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:20,380
inside you find the time and you create

101
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:22,930
an object URL from that that's a future

102
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:25,060
last time I checked Safari is not up to

103
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:27,490
this so we kind of fall back to the

104
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:30,460
existing wave that works pretty well you

105
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:32,200
guys certainly know Delta your eyes so

106
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,910
we just type the whole SVG into a data

107
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:39,200
URI into an image and you're done so

108
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:41,680
yeah we can bring this together and

109
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,540
that's fairly simple I talked a lot but

110
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:45,400
basically that's the solution you create

111
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,290
a new image stuff the day URL into that

112
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:49,740
image and you draw this to the canvas

113
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:55,000
well congratulations basically um we're

114
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,660
done we embedded HTML as an HTML string

115
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:01,210
into a foreign object into an SVG which

116
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:02,620
we then converted into a data URI to

117
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:04,780
yield an image that we then drew into

118
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:07,240
the canvas using raw image well that

119
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:13,840
sounds all good now again but so SVG is

120
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,610
not allowed to reference external

121
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:19,030
resources and now it's it starts being

122
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:24,400
much more fun so if you if you draw an

123
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,640
SVG to the canvas all your resources

124
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:29,950
need need to be in line or need to be

125
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:31,720
present in that document you're not

126
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:34,630
allowed to link to external stuff well

127
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:36,280
that's a problem because HTML does allow

128
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:38,460
me to include images

129
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:41,490
buttons that are typed image style

130
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:46,710
sheets background images and import font

131
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:48,750
face that's a lot and that's that's all

132
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:51,960
referencing external resources that SVG

133
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:55,830
is not allowed to access so next step

134
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:57,479
what could we do to solve that and you

135
00:06:57,479 --> 00:06:59,690
see it's it's all like very logical

136
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:01,770
steps to that it's getting its getting

137
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:04,080
worse by the minute kind of though I can

138
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:08,009
easily include images or buttons up in a

139
00:07:08,009 --> 00:07:11,210
Type image so sorry inputs of top image

140
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:15,120
so basically all I need to do is create

141
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,370
get the HTML string create a document

142
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:19,800
from that so give a get a Dom structure

143
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:22,050
that I can basically just get myself all

144
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:24,449
the images iterate over those images and

145
00:07:24,449 --> 00:07:26,160
just load and embed that image source

146
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:30,599
that's theory how does it look like so

147
00:07:30,599 --> 00:07:34,650
um well that's an image that's an

148
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:37,560
external path external image.png what I

149
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,810
want to do is just replace that content

150
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:41,970
of the image as a base64 string into

151
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:44,880
that image how do I do this oh I can

152
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,560
load that image via Ajax right so

153
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,199
basically all I do is I create an xhr

154
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:52,560
request sorry xhr and wait for the image

155
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,330
to load and when the content is there I

156
00:07:54,330 --> 00:08:00,120
I then serialize it to base64 yeah I

157
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,199
think the guys are just really upset my

158
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:05,780
time clock is not set correctly so or

159
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:08,099
basically loading loading the image file

160
00:08:08,099 --> 00:08:10,409
HX and just piping this utilized base64

161
00:08:10,409 --> 00:08:13,099
encoded content back to the image that

162
00:08:13,099 --> 00:08:15,530
sounds bit easier than it actually is

163
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:19,860
Ajax does not allow sorry it just is not

164
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:23,250
allow you to load binary context Ajax

165
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:25,830
was defined to load XML which is text so

166
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:28,740
that is solved there's a new interface

167
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:30,360
you guys possibly know about XML HTTP

168
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:33,750
because to this knows about binary blobs

169
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:35,579
for last time I checked Safari again is

170
00:08:35,579 --> 00:08:38,190
not up up to that so that's the easy

171
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:39,709
workaround it's one of the top-rated

172
00:08:39,709 --> 00:08:42,000
answers on Stack Overflow what'd you

173
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,579
just do is when you get back the binary

174
00:08:44,579 --> 00:08:47,760
content is kind of an awful state what'd

175
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,709
you just do is you iterate over each and

176
00:08:49,709 --> 00:08:51,400
every bite

177
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:55,630
you and it with a white mask too but

178
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:58,690
basically cut of everything but outside

179
00:08:58,690 --> 00:09:03,100
the the white field so that's a very

180
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:07,120
ugly hack it is very very slow if you

181
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,010
load like if you can make it by its a

182
00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:12,160
big image yeah anyway but that's that's

183
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,300
the solution the best solution that

184
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:17,860
works right now so so basically I just

185
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:20,350
showed you how to email in line an image

186
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:23,890
using Ajax and then one doing the binary

187
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:25,600
conversion and I can now feed that back

188
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,180
into the HTML page using data your eyes

189
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:30,220
next step background images right you

190
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:31,810
remember the list i showed you a few

191
00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:33,580
minutes ago basically all those

192
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:35,170
different kind of things background

193
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:36,940
image was number two how do we in line

194
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:39,130
background images background images all

195
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:41,500
images the problem is they are hidden in

196
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:44,440
CSS well that's pretty simple now I just

197
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,300
need a CSS parser to go through all my

198
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:47,860
CSS found all the background images in

199
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:49,750
line those resources just as I did

200
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:53,230
before well that's pretty simple so hey

201
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:55,690
we just want our own CSS parser for that

202
00:09:55,690 --> 00:09:59,470
which then again is fairly simple so the

203
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:02,170
browser is a CS has a big CSS parser

204
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:05,140
right I mean basically a boy talking

205
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:06,520
about here's everything what the vowels

206
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:08,320
already does you just need to kind of

207
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,360
find a way to trigger that so here's the

208
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,040
power CSS method basically what it does

209
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:16,060
is it creates a style element puts the

210
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:17,800
CSS that you want to pass into that

211
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:20,380
style element and now he's a small ugly

212
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:23,100
hack you need to create a document

213
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,880
you're not interested in that document

214
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,980
but you need to apply that style element

215
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:29,650
that you created into some kind of Dom

216
00:10:29,650 --> 00:10:31,630
structure otherwise the browser does not

217
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:34,120
execute the parsing algorithm so what

218
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,650
you do create a solemn and put the text

219
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:37,090
inside the style element put the style

220
00:10:37,090 --> 00:10:38,830
element into the document and then

221
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:43,090
finally can access the past CSS rules so

222
00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:45,370
that's the shortest CSS implementation

223
00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:48,040
there is it's yan so you get from stack

224
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:51,540
overflow I think I answered that and

225
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:53,590
that's how you do CSS pausing in the

226
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:56,950
browser now we can put this together

227
00:10:56,950 --> 00:10:59,980
again we pass CSS with the background

228
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:02,470
images we find we iterate over all the

229
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:04,390
rules if the property value background

230
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:04,870
image is

231
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:06,850
we in line that background images and

232
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:08,890
install that back into the CSS we've

233
00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:10,510
done that with in with the image before

234
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:12,070
so this is just basically the same thing

235
00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:14,020
with the added complexity of positing

236
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:19,270
CSS next next on the list um there are

237
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:22,690
linked elements are there with the style

238
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:24,400
sheets so what we need to do is now in

239
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,140
line those elements we're not allowed to

240
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:29,830
put that into an SVG the link elements

241
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:31,420
are not referenced in that SVG so we

242
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:34,870
need to inline this well sorry what what

243
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:37,540
we need to do is we need to load the

244
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:41,680
content again via Ajax that's fine then

245
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,430
we just put the content into a style

246
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:48,790
element and then we basically done well

247
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:51,970
not really so if you guys know CSS I

248
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:56,380
know it's jazz club but so there is the

249
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:59,830
thing that resources linked in CSS are

250
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:02,920
relative to the style sheet so if i take

251
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:05,200
starchy content take it out of the style

252
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,150
sheet and put it into the HTML document

253
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:10,779
the urls are all wrong so what i need to

254
00:12:10,779 --> 00:12:12,490
do before pasting it into a style

255
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:14,200
element i need to go through all the

256
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:18,130
urls which is background images which is

257
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:21,040
fun phase rules and app-style imports I

258
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:24,370
need to fix this up all those URLs well

259
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:26,020
that's simple again you just need to

260
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:27,959
take care of that so here's the example

261
00:12:27,959 --> 00:12:31,810
if I have a sprite.png that sits below

262
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:35,230
the parent folder and then images and

263
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:38,529
this is referenced in assets by default

264
00:12:38,529 --> 00:12:40,529
CSS I need to kind of adapt that path

265
00:12:40,529 --> 00:12:43,510
because now assets is basically the

266
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:45,730
offset to that so I just use the URL

267
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:47,500
pazza from from the node.js

268
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,089
implementation which is pure JavaScript

269
00:12:49,089 --> 00:12:51,700
which is which is a very easy to include

270
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:54,490
them thanks for browsing file so it

271
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:56,140
would be nice for the browser to allow

272
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:57,940
you to do a URL pausing beside you have

273
00:12:57,940 --> 00:12:59,260
to fall back to a pure JavaScript

274
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:03,330
implementation again well there you go

275
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:07,209
basically we rendered HTML through an

276
00:13:07,209 --> 00:13:10,300
SVG is foreign object we in line all the

277
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:14,110
external resources by first loading

278
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:16,360
content through ajax in case of binary

279
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,170
content did an extra hack

280
00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:20,930
we admitted images and fonts through

281
00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:24,800
data your eyes for style sheets we just

282
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,649
pasted the whole text we passed CSS

283
00:13:27,649 --> 00:13:29,690
finding resources that we needed to

284
00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:31,250
adapt again is kind of a recursive

285
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:35,180
search and we adapted relative paths so

286
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:36,440
basically that's the whole algorithm

287
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:40,100
behind getting don't forget what the

288
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:42,620
initial target was forgetting HTML

289
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:47,230
inside an SVG rendered to the canvas so

290
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:50,959
yeah let's talking more demo time what

291
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:52,130
you're saying seeing here and I don't

292
00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:53,570
you might not believe me so i'm going to

293
00:13:53,570 --> 00:13:57,889
show you this is the title page of my

294
00:13:57,889 --> 00:14:02,060
talk rendered into a canvas well it's a

295
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:03,230
bit hard to believe right could it could

296
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:04,970
have just been a screenshot I've taken

297
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:14,189
so let's switch over to I can just yep

298
00:14:14,199 --> 00:14:21,410
so just say hey there and we load that

299
00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:23,930
and even better to show you that this is

300
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:25,550
actually a canvas i can start shooting

301
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:27,380
my HTML and do something awesome with

302
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:34,920
that

303
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:37,880
so yeah maybe that I'll set at least one

304
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:40,459
question why why why why would you do

305
00:14:40,459 --> 00:14:44,420
that that interestingly yeah I don't

306
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:45,350
know I don't know if you want to have

307
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:46,790
that on your website but it's a it's a

308
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:51,260
funny funny thing to do okay it before

309
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:52,850
you like all storm out and say I want to

310
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:54,050
do that on my next project or something

311
00:14:54,050 --> 00:14:55,959
which you possibly don't but anyway

312
00:14:55,959 --> 00:14:57,950
there are a few issues that you need to

313
00:14:57,950 --> 00:15:02,570
know about so first of all as I said

314
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:05,089
before the browser does not allow you to

315
00:15:05,089 --> 00:15:07,760
do certain kinds of things for a good

316
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:11,570
reason and here we this hack basically

317
00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:14,630
does not open up a total new attack

318
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:17,300
vector all the resources that we in line

319
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:19,250
everything that we're doing is all in

320
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:21,290
the confines of the existing solution

321
00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:23,149
but that means all the content that we

322
00:15:23,149 --> 00:15:25,730
in line through ajax is bound to the

323
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:27,950
same origin policy so if you want to

324
00:15:27,950 --> 00:15:29,779
let's say just take a screenshot of

325
00:15:29,779 --> 00:15:32,540
google com well i can't do that from my

326
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:33,980
web page here because i can't access

327
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:36,620
google com through ajax unless of course

328
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:39,680
the server that you want to request with

329
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:42,769
they offer calls headers or something so

330
00:15:42,769 --> 00:15:43,880
this is not a solution to take

331
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:45,380
screenshot of any pages no you're not

332
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:46,699
allowed to do that otherwise you could

333
00:15:46,699 --> 00:15:48,500
be reading out somebody else's gmail

334
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:53,120
account then there's a I consider that a

335
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:56,329
bug I've talked to a few chrome guys I

336
00:15:56,329 --> 00:15:58,670
chrome developers rereading from the

337
00:15:58,670 --> 00:16:00,980
canvas so far is not allowed in Safari

338
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:06,730
and chrome so um firefox shines um and

339
00:16:06,730 --> 00:16:09,019
the problem here is basically that

340
00:16:09,019 --> 00:16:12,320
Safari and chrome have a no no I'm kind

341
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,910
of guessing I believe they have a kind

342
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:16,089
of simplistic approach to their sandbox

343
00:16:16,089 --> 00:16:19,670
because they didn't then see somebody

344
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:21,740
coming along and wanted to do that kind

345
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:23,810
of thing they just say whatever there is

346
00:16:23,810 --> 00:16:25,820
if there is a foreign object inside an

347
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:27,529
SVG you we're just going to paint the

348
00:16:27,529 --> 00:16:29,000
canvas and if you want to read back from

349
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,079
the camels we're going to throw our

350
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:32,449
security exception so in that case if

351
00:16:32,449 --> 00:16:34,100
you want to do something like that and

352
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:35,529
you want to read back from the canvas

353
00:16:35,529 --> 00:16:38,149
then no sorry you're getting these three

354
00:16:38,149 --> 00:16:39,800
security exception if you want to do

355
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:42,730
that firefox so far as the only solution

356
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:46,690
next issue is the IE guys

357
00:16:46,690 --> 00:16:51,490
a sorry the idea are you guys are now

358
00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:52,900
starting to implement for an object are

359
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:55,120
ye so far doesn't support it luckily it

360
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,850
did change from in consideration to in

361
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:59,680
development so hey I'm waiting for the

362
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,930
next IE version to come out and

363
00:17:01,930 --> 00:17:05,430
hopefully we can do the same thing there

364
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:09,510
one more thing form inputs don't render

365
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:12,660
the the best implement the best

366
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:15,520
explanation that i have is well form

367
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:19,060
inputs um I kind of a kind of fall back

368
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:21,910
to what your host system gives you right

369
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:25,209
so and possibly the SVA SVG rendering

370
00:17:25,209 --> 00:17:27,220
capability does not have access to that

371
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:29,350
so form improves kind of look funny a

372
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:32,080
lasting performance I did concern so it

373
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,520
does take a lot of time doing all that

374
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:36,910
Ajax were appalling then getting the CSS

375
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:39,190
parsing the CSS Elenna everything it can

376
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:42,250
take up to a few seconds I did consider

377
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:44,710
using a web worker for that but sadly I

378
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:48,670
do make a use of a lot of dumb api's I

379
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:51,400
don't need the actual page this is going

380
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,260
to but I need something and you saw the

381
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:56,110
example further CSS parser this used a

382
00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:58,780
newly created document so i do need

383
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:00,250
access to that and sadly that is not

384
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:03,700
doable in web workers here's an

385
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:05,830
incomplete list of workarounds that was

386
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:09,640
needed to get all that stuff going i'm

387
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:11,170
not going to go through that a full list

388
00:18:11,170 --> 00:18:12,670
this is but bit of a reference and kind

389
00:18:12,670 --> 00:18:14,890
of to show you that whatever code you

390
00:18:14,890 --> 00:18:17,290
guys are writing doing your day job it's

391
00:18:17,290 --> 00:18:19,180
not going to be as worse as what you're

392
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:22,450
seeing here so i think i hope people

393
00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:24,430
hope companies in the future will still

394
00:18:24,430 --> 00:18:26,830
employ me without you know knowing that

395
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:28,450
i'm one of the worst hackers in the

396
00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:31,540
world there are a few outstanding

397
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:34,210
browser issues here so some of that

398
00:18:34,210 --> 00:18:36,460
things you need to work around if you

399
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:38,590
want to do stuff like that and some of

400
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:40,810
them just basically keep me from going

401
00:18:40,810 --> 00:18:43,600
further and it's interestingly but

402
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,280
number one is Roberto cut cut

403
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:48,490
o'callaghan from Mozilla who just got me

404
00:18:48,490 --> 00:18:50,470
on to that idea so he's I think from New

405
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:52,480
Zealand and he started talking about

406
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:56,860
rendering HTML to the canvas in 2006 so

407
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:58,900
he kind of inspired me to go down that

408
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:02,470
road and do that all that they

409
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:05,010
well what what is this all about it's

410
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:07,470
not not just fun I didn't sit down for

411
00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:10,020
more than a year to to get that kind of

412
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:14,220
solve so this first went into a project

413
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:17,960
on github like a few different ones um

414
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,920
because basically I needed to implement

415
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:23,310
a full resource a inlining process there

416
00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:24,720
are lot of node solutions to that but

417
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,550
sadly none works in the browser because

418
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:28,230
nobody is I think is stupid enough to do

419
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:32,070
that in the browser and 24 8 people on

420
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:34,590
github things it's a neat idea I just

421
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:36,300
don't know why I don't know what they

422
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:38,310
are using it for I've talked to a few

423
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:40,500
people at this conference and few people

424
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,150
some people actually seem to be using

425
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:44,640
HTML to canvas which is a similar

426
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:48,030
solution for finding out issues with our

427
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:49,890
webpage so if user complaints that

428
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:51,330
something's wrong they like to take a

429
00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:53,220
screenshot of that page phone back home

430
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:54,420
and then they know for debugging

431
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:57,330
purposes what went wrong my personal use

432
00:19:57,330 --> 00:19:59,730
case and a few of you see me talking on

433
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:02,370
Tuesday of CSS calm I want to prove that

434
00:20:02,370 --> 00:20:05,730
you can test CSS and the UI taking

435
00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:07,740
screenshots and that is why I basically

436
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:12,240
went down that path so thanks guys for

437
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,890
listening and maybe you do something
