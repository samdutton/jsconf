00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:08,450

hi my name is Amy Chang so I'm a web

2
00:00:08,450 --> 00:00:09,889
developer the Brooklyn Museum in New

3
00:00:09,889 --> 00:00:11,540
York City and I'm very excited to talk

4
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:13,309
to you guys about how you can connect

5
00:00:13,309 --> 00:00:15,469
everything you own to the Internet so

6
00:00:15,469 --> 00:00:17,990
I'm going to go over some existing IOT

7
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:19,189
devices and then I'm going to go over

8
00:00:19,189 --> 00:00:20,930
some tools that you can use to create

9
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:24,890
the IOT device of your dreams so what do

10
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:27,470
I mean by IOT device and smart device

11
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:29,779
basically i'm referring to objects or

12
00:00:29,779 --> 00:00:32,090
devices that are not necessarily laptops

13
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:34,100
or desktop computers that can

14
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:35,629
communicate the internet or other

15
00:00:35,629 --> 00:00:37,370
devices that are connected to the

16
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:40,309
internet or on the saint or are on the

17
00:00:40,309 --> 00:00:42,290
same network as the IOT device so via

18
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:45,979
bluetooth so simply put an IOT device or

19
00:00:45,979 --> 00:00:48,650
smart devices any devices aware of the

20
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:51,500
Internet we already own a lot of these

21
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:53,449
things we have smartphones we have

22
00:00:53,449 --> 00:00:55,879
fitness trackers some of us might have

23
00:00:55,879 --> 00:00:58,280
nest thermostats and smart light bulbs

24
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:00,860
and air conditioners and canary security

25
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:03,140
systems that we can all control with our

26
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:05,210
phones from anywhere but what are the

27
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:06,920
ramifications of this what happens when

28
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:08,689
more and more stuff is connected to

29
00:01:08,689 --> 00:01:11,060
internet well it means more and more

30
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:13,250
stuff can listen in on us on the screen

31
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:16,640
is the Amazon echo which is vertically a

32
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,370
virtual assistant in a device you can

33
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:21,710
integrate other IOT devices with it and

34
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:24,500
you can sort of asked it to go to Amazon

35
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:26,420
website and buy stuff for you and we

36
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:28,730
know for a fact that the Amazon echo is

37
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:31,220
listening in our conversations paying

38
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:33,380
close attention to locations that we

39
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:35,810
might mention in a conversation as well

40
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:38,540
as commands and it needs access to the

41
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:40,159
internet because in the device there's

42
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:42,860
not enough processing power to do

43
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:45,920
natural language recognition so we're

44
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,600
just trusting amazon that they're not

45
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:51,470
mining our data earlier this year eter

46
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:53,750
was discovered in the privacy policy for

47
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:56,150
samsung smart TV so this line was

48
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:58,100
discovered in the privacy policy for

49
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:00,740
samsung smart tvs please be aware that

50
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:03,080
if you're spoken words include personal

51
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:05,420
or other sensitive information that

52
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:07,100
information will be among the data

53
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:09,140
captured and transmitted to a third

54
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:11,930
party so there are two very scary things

55
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:14,780
about this statement that it can hear

56
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:16,910
sensitive information and the second

57
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:17,900
scary thing is

58
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:20,390
third party part it's like who's this

59
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:23,840
third party is it not Samsung is it an

60
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,970
advertising company or is it something

61
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:30,459
even scarier another ramification of

62
00:02:30,459 --> 00:02:33,409
more and more objects having unfettered

63
00:02:33,409 --> 00:02:35,720
access to the web is that things can get

64
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:38,810
hacked so earlier in july of this year

65
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:41,480
report from wired sat in a jeep well was

66
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:44,269
being hacked so while the reporter was

67
00:02:44,269 --> 00:02:46,159
in the street the air conditioning was

68
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:47,900
being messed with radio stations were

69
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:51,950
being changed and very scary breaks were

70
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:55,609
remotely disabled so on the flip side of

71
00:02:55,609 --> 00:02:58,010
things even though things even more and

72
00:02:58,010 --> 00:02:59,799
more objects are listening in on us

73
00:02:59,799 --> 00:03:02,930
warmer objects are listening to us it's

74
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:05,689
not inconceivable to think of having

75
00:03:05,689 --> 00:03:08,420
Samantha from the movie her existing in

76
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:11,900
the next 5-10 years so having a virtual

77
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,549
assistant that's paying attention to all

78
00:03:13,549 --> 00:03:15,379
our needs maybe even having a

79
00:03:15,379 --> 00:03:20,540
personality that complements our own so

80
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:22,849
Lauren McCarthy this artist created this

81
00:03:22,849 --> 00:03:25,160
app called people keeper people keeper

82
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:27,049
is a mobile app that can integrate with

83
00:03:27,049 --> 00:03:28,819
your fitness tracker and the goal of

84
00:03:28,819 --> 00:03:32,000
people keeper is to pay attention to

85
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,530
your vitals while you're talking to

86
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:35,030
people and the goal of this app is

87
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:37,549
basically to tell you or to let you be

88
00:03:37,549 --> 00:03:39,739
more aware of friends that might be

89
00:03:39,739 --> 00:03:44,700
emotionally toxic for you

90
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:47,480
as more and more things are connected to

91
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:50,510
the Internet if we have more and more

92
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:52,819
options to hack things to see their own

93
00:03:52,819 --> 00:03:55,250
needs on the right is a tamagotchi

94
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:58,220
that's so when tamagotchis first came

95
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:00,650
out what in the late mid to late 90s

96
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:02,720
they were not connected to internet well

97
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,640
someone got a few of these Tamagotchis

98
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:07,250
cracked them open and put Wi-Fi module

99
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:09,170
in them and basically created a high of

100
00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:11,209
Tamagotchi so just a bunch of

101
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:12,590
Tamagotchis that could talk to each

102
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:17,690
other on the left Netflix so a few

103
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:19,640
months ago Netflix put our tutorial on

104
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:22,070
how to create the netflix switch so with

105
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:23,480
the press of a button you can order

106
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,940
pizza you can turn off your smart lights

107
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:31,640
and you can turn on Netflix so the fact

108
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:35,540
that objects are surveilling us kind of

109
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:37,370
invading our privacy without us knowing

110
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:40,040
about it have the capability of being

111
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:42,830
hacked for someone far away cap it's a

112
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:45,800
very dystopian future dystopian outlook

113
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:48,050
for the future of IOT but on the other

114
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:49,790
hand things that listening us things

115
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:52,700
that are our best friends and things

116
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:55,010
that we can modify to suit our own needs

117
00:04:55,010 --> 00:04:57,500
paint a utopian picture of the future

118
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,840
but what most likely is going to happen

119
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,150
in the next 5-10 years is that IOT is

120
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:03,800
going to fall somewhere in the middle

121
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:07,340
between dystopian utopian dystopian and

122
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:10,460
utopian future but is there a way to

123
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:12,560
kind of nudge that a little bit towards

124
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,560
utopian and I feel like that it there is

125
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:18,530
a way to do that we can participate in

126
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:20,960
the conversation of what is IOT what can

127
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,900
and what can smart devices do for us by

128
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:26,600
making stuff we can create things that

129
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,550
are more secure and more accommodating

130
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:30,680
and at the very least we become more

131
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:32,660
educated consumers and we learn a little

132
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:34,280
bit more about this technology that's

133
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:36,580
all you're going to be more pervasive

134
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:41,600
more pervasive over the years also IOT

135
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,060
devices do not have to be limited do not

136
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:46,039
have to be limited to the stuff we can

137
00:05:46,039 --> 00:05:49,070
buy at brookstone or Kickstarter if it

138
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:50,539
doesn't exist or doesn't work the way we

139
00:05:50,539 --> 00:05:53,600
wanted to we can make it

140
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,180
so for instance I want to create a Smart

141
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:58,370
Plan now there are plenty of sensor kits

142
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:00,890
that you can buy to monitor humidity

143
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:03,830
temperature even the nitrogen levels of

144
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:05,620
soil but I don't want to do any of that

145
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:10,340
so I use an Intel s in an old old ipod

146
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:12,860
touch and a light sensor to create plant

147
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:14,960
pot plant but is basically a very lonely

148
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,780
house plant since it doesn't have ears

149
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:19,790
you can text it and once in a while

150
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:22,390
alike ask the room to like talk to it

151
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:25,100
also has a light sensor and if it

152
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:26,990
detects that there is not enough ambient

153
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:29,540
light it'll send a message to its screen

154
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:31,040
and be like hey could you shine this

155
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:36,560
flashlight on me so let's go through a

156
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,480
design exercise let's build a smart dog

157
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:44,060
what constitutes a smart dog so we have

158
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:47,210
a dog and we need a way to sort of

159
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:49,010
handle all the information coming in

160
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:51,800
from the environment or from the dog and

161
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:54,590
we in a way to connect to the internet

162
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:57,890
or connect to an device that does have

163
00:06:57,890 --> 00:07:00,380
internet with Bluetooth that's number

164
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:02,240
two number three we need a way to gather

165
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,220
information about the dog or about its

166
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:05,780
environment and we can do that with a

167
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:08,630
sensor a Bluetooth Low Energy doohickey

168
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:13,640
or a webcam there are so many options in

169
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:16,010
terms of micron controllers and more and

170
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:18,110
it seems like every hour someone's

171
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:20,090
putting out a new board but I'm only

172
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:23,720
going to go over five for this talk so

173
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:26,120
the first one is the Adafruit flora it's

174
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:28,880
basically designed for it's basically

175
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,640
designed to be sewn into fabric as such

176
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:33,710
it has a very compact design and large

177
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:36,920
holes large holes that you can stick a

178
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:39,020
sewing needle through now the flora does

179
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:41,000
not connect to anything on its own

180
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:46,610
you'll need a bluetooth module and an

181
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:48,530
added fruit does put out a mobile app

182
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:49,700
that will let you configure this

183
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:52,220
Bluetooth module pretty easily next we

184
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:54,320
have the parco photon parco float the

185
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:58,370
photon does have an onboard Wi-Fi Wi-Fi

186
00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:00,590
module it's also pretty cheap at twenty

187
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:03,500
bucks the park also has this neat mobile

188
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,840
app that lets you find the correct that

189
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:06,930
helps you find

190
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:08,789
the correct Wi-Fi network to connect you

191
00:08:08,789 --> 00:08:11,669
as well as configure the input/output

192
00:08:11,669 --> 00:08:16,830
pins on the board you can also use

193
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:18,720
javascript to act as the glue between

194
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:22,949
the photon and park old cloud services

195
00:08:22,949 --> 00:08:24,660
oh I forgot to mention so in order to

196
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:27,180
program the floor I you use Arduino the

197
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:30,690
photon is also our Juno code what's diff

198
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:33,060
what what's different about the tehsil

199
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:34,709
too sorry i couldn't find a picture of a

200
00:08:34,709 --> 00:08:39,630
hand holding it the tehsil too is that

201
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:41,729
the Tesla tool has onboard Wi-Fi but

202
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:44,190
also compile a compiled JavaScript on

203
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:50,010
the board itself next we have their

204
00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:51,959
joint on you which also has onboard

205
00:08:51,959 --> 00:08:53,940
Wi-Fi what's interesting about the unit

206
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:56,190
that has two processors one that you can

207
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:59,190
call code with Arduino and the other you

208
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:03,330
can install Linux or there's a specified

209
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:05,339
Linux image that's compatible with the

210
00:09:05,339 --> 00:09:09,810
Union so that Linux image that's

211
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:11,250
recommended for you in comes installed

212
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:13,110
with Python but you can also install

213
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:17,640
nodejs on it if you wanted to the next

214
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:22,680
one is the Edison so the Edison itself

215
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:26,670
is that top is a that kind of SD card

216
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:28,110
looking thing that's in between the

217
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:30,000
thumb and the index figure everything

218
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,360
else is an optional breakout board so

219
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,760
the Edison it is also another embedded

220
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,220
Linux board it has onboard Wi-Fi has

221
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:41,000
also has an onboard bluetooth module and

222
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,810
the operating system called yak doe last

223
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:48,270
I heard it was called yocto has ombre

224
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:51,089
head support for arduino code nodejs C

225
00:09:51,089 --> 00:09:55,650
C++ Python as well as wolfram alpha is

226
00:09:55,650 --> 00:09:58,680
programming language it also has USB

227
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:01,020
ports so you can plug in USB devices to

228
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:04,079
the SN you just have to make sure to set

229
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:07,050
the Intel s in the host mode so what's

230
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:08,910
interesting about the Intel Edison is

231
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:11,010
that has pretty beefy specs I think it

232
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:13,950
has about 40 input/output pins and

233
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:16,470
several gigabytes on onboard mmm

234
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:20,370
ree storage as well as ram it's designed

235
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:23,100
it's marketed towards the word for like

236
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:25,170
enterprise wearables thing so I think

237
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:27,840
Intel's goal with the Intel essen is to

238
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:30,420
have other manufacturers use the Intel

239
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:32,700
Edison module in their own devices as

240
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:35,910
such is not as beginner-friendly as

241
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:38,460
these boards so beware you might be

242
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:41,100
spending a few hours getting the onboard

243
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:47,220
led to blink so how do you choose a

244
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:49,590
board well you have to consider the form

245
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:52,350
factor do we want to create a cough

246
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:54,690
collar for our dog if so we could

247
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:56,130
probably use the flora but the thing

248
00:10:56,130 --> 00:10:59,700
with the cloth a thing with electronics

249
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,380
is that you cannot put them through the

250
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:03,480
wash so when you're designing a cloth

251
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:05,880
collar you're going to have to sort of

252
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:08,700
design a cloth pocket for the Adafruit

253
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:11,460
flora any associated any sensor modules

254
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:13,320
you want to use as well as a battery

255
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,630
pack but maybe the neck of your dog is

256
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:18,720
pretty strong could we have it carry

257
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,210
around a big box of electronics around

258
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:24,360
its neck maybe we don't want our dog to

259
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:28,500
be wearing wearing circuits and chips

260
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:31,620
maybe we can create a sort of an station

261
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:34,170
by where we know a by an area we know

262
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:36,420
that our dog will frequent and then we

263
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:37,800
can just leave it plugged into the wall

264
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,210
if we leave it plugged in the wall we

265
00:11:39,210 --> 00:11:40,740
don't have to worry about battery life

266
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:43,530
because when you're using batteries you

267
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:45,540
will not know unless you design a

268
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:47,340
separate interface for it you will not

269
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:49,590
know when your battery is low and the

270
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:52,470
only time when you will when you do know

271
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:54,180
them went batteries lows when the thing

272
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:58,560
stops working another thing you want to

273
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,500
consider is what you actually want to do

274
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:02,880
with the irt device are you going to

275
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,530
have multiple sensors you want to do

276
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:06,570
image recognition do you want to do any

277
00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:08,520
fancy math if so you'll need a board

278
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:13,519
that has more processing power

279
00:12:13,529 --> 00:12:16,870
okay so now that we've chosen a board we

280
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:19,660
have to now that we've chosen a board

281
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:21,730
maybe we can start looking at sensors

282
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:24,850
right now so the Adafruit flora has its

283
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:27,339
own family of modules there's a growth

284
00:12:27,339 --> 00:12:31,410
kit which has special editions for the

285
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:33,610
forward we know boards as well as an

286
00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:35,710
Intel Edison and then there's the Exodus

287
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:38,290
wearables kit for the Intel essen so

288
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:40,779
with the X with the exit now whereas

289
00:12:40,779 --> 00:12:43,750
will kit the sensors are kind of smaller

290
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:45,790
compared to other modules and it's

291
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:50,430
specifically designed for like wearables

292
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:53,770
now these sensor kits usually come with

293
00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:55,650
sensors for detecting temperature

294
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:58,390
movement so there's accelerometers that

295
00:12:58,390 --> 00:13:01,480
kind of thing but I invite you to get

296
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:04,240
creative I know a particularly bad habit

297
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,220
of mine when it comes to designing

298
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:08,800
physical computing projects is that I

299
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:12,310
limit myself to sensors and capabilities

300
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:14,230
that are available in the kits that

301
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:17,170
happen to have it's not necessarily a

302
00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:19,209
bad thing but you know you could always

303
00:13:19,209 --> 00:13:21,130
think bigger so did you know that

304
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:24,010
there's a gas sensor so gas sensors have

305
00:13:24,010 --> 00:13:26,200
heaters in them and as gas passes

306
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,970
through the gas sensor it produces an

307
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:30,190
electrochemical reaction and then

308
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:32,950
voltage is produced by this

309
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:34,810
electrochemical reaction voltage that

310
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:37,029
can be read by the microcontroller now

311
00:13:37,029 --> 00:13:38,470
what can you do with an internet-enabled

312
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:45,250
dog and a gas sensor and in the course

313
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:46,959
of your research if you find a sensor

314
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:49,000
that you want to use but doesn't have an

315
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,400
organic chem and isn't arduino

316
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:54,160
compatible you can create your own

317
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:58,480
breakout board for it so for an old

318
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,400
project of mine I wanted to create an

319
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,350
installation that reacted to incoming

320
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:04,720
and outgoing radio frequencies now at

321
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,089
that time there was no Audrina already

322
00:14:07,089 --> 00:14:09,459
sensor for that but in my research I

323
00:14:09,459 --> 00:14:11,020
found that someone had created a

324
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:12,850
breakout board for the sensor so what's

325
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:16,000
on the right is the manufacturers data

326
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,800
sheet and what's on the left is a

327
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,750
circuit board design for an Arduino

328
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:21,660
ready breakout board for that sense

329
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:24,150
so problems you'll have to solve when

330
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:25,080
you're trying to create your own

331
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:27,390
breakout board for the sensor is which

332
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:30,060
pin is power in how much voltage does a

333
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:34,110
sensor take where's the ground pin what

334
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:36,450
kind of where the data in pin is where's

335
00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:39,630
the data out pin what kind of protocol

336
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:41,610
is this sensor using to communicate with

337
00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:44,820
the microcontroller is it an analog

338
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:47,700
sensor so does it fluctuate between 0 to

339
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:50,760
5 volts is it a digital sensor does it

340
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:53,130
have on and off states is it I to see is

341
00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:56,250
it cereal also when it comes to power

342
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:58,680
what resistors and capacitors or

343
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,330
whatever will I have to use to regulate

344
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:01,950
the voltage because if you are using

345
00:15:01,950 --> 00:15:04,830
incorrect voltage with the sensor you

346
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:06,960
can either fri the sensor or the

347
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,850
microcontroller will get gibberish as

348
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:13,410
data maybe you don't want to sense

349
00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:15,840
things with environmental sensors let's

350
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:20,130
say my dog Poochie has this very this e

351
00:15:20,130 --> 00:15:22,410
to add the trash and I don't want to

352
00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:24,780
like have it do it I don't want the dog

353
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:26,670
eating out of the trash we can use a

354
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:29,610
bluetooth low energy doohickeys i don't

355
00:15:29,610 --> 00:15:32,550
know what the correct term is so we can

356
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:35,010
use beacons and eddie stones so beacons

357
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:36,830
is the name of apple's indoor mapping

358
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:39,930
beacon a Bluetooth Low Energy doohickey

359
00:15:39,930 --> 00:15:42,120
and Eddie stones which is still

360
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:44,460
relatively new is the name of Google's

361
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:46,310
indoor mapping Bluetooth Low Energy

362
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:50,700
doohickey um excuse me so bluetooth low

363
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:53,130
energy devices constantly broadcast

364
00:15:53,130 --> 00:15:55,770
messages out into the ether hoping for a

365
00:15:55,770 --> 00:15:59,730
mobile app to receive those messages so

366
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:01,980
beacons emit three strings of IDs

367
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:04,260
there's a major ID a minor ID and a

368
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:09,320
generic ID Eddie stones broadcast URLs

369
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:13,740
so they're designed for mobile app use

370
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:16,170
but you could use JavaScript to create

371
00:16:16,170 --> 00:16:19,350
some code that will listen in on beacons

372
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:23,040
or Eddie stones and so let's say we play

373
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,830
some be a beacon next to the trash and

374
00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:29,430
then each time the dog collar to text

375
00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:31,890
the beacon we can have a computer nearby

376
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:33,889
with speakers be like

377
00:16:33,889 --> 00:16:38,179
poochie don't eat the trash okay so and

378
00:16:38,179 --> 00:16:39,679
then we can also use webcams they are

379
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:41,749
doing a compatible webcam so you can

380
00:16:41,749 --> 00:16:45,319
also use use it you can also use usb

381
00:16:45,319 --> 00:16:48,379
webcams the things with USB webcams is

382
00:16:48,379 --> 00:16:50,949
that you'll need a beef your

383
00:16:50,949 --> 00:16:53,389
microcontroller because you'll need USB

384
00:16:53,389 --> 00:16:57,379
drivers the UVC drivers which I think

385
00:16:57,379 --> 00:17:00,829
stands for a USB video control but so

386
00:17:00,829 --> 00:17:02,569
after you have all the drivers installed

387
00:17:02,569 --> 00:17:04,579
and if you have any room left you can

388
00:17:04,579 --> 00:17:07,069
also install opencv to do more advanced

389
00:17:07,069 --> 00:17:11,449
image recognition oh and another reason

390
00:17:11,449 --> 00:17:13,370
why you need a microcontroller will

391
00:17:13,370 --> 00:17:14,899
slightly be for your specs is that

392
00:17:14,899 --> 00:17:16,909
you'll need to be able to stream by it's

393
00:17:16,909 --> 00:17:22,579
coming from the webcam into a file okay

394
00:17:22,579 --> 00:17:28,279
so okay so now that we have our my

395
00:17:28,279 --> 00:17:31,519
controller and now that we have our

396
00:17:31,519 --> 00:17:35,029
microcontroller and we have data coming

397
00:17:35,029 --> 00:17:36,500
in from the environment about the duck

398
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:38,149
itself it's time to send all that

399
00:17:38,149 --> 00:17:39,710
information to the cloud and do stuff

400
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:41,179
with it now there are plenty of

401
00:17:41,179 --> 00:17:43,279
third-party services you can use there's

402
00:17:43,279 --> 00:17:45,289
tembu which has dropbox integration

403
00:17:45,289 --> 00:17:50,059
there's also spark data so sparkfun who

404
00:17:50,059 --> 00:17:52,370
a spark fund which sells electronics has

405
00:17:52,370 --> 00:17:54,169
their own kind of API service that lets

406
00:17:54,169 --> 00:17:56,600
you kind of send data and store it on

407
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:59,840
their servers then Park whole also has a

408
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:02,750
cloudy API for its family of devices

409
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:06,380
Google Amazon IBM are also getting in on

410
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:08,570
the IOT game so they have more

411
00:18:08,570 --> 00:18:12,620
enterprising level for cloud for cloud

412
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:14,539
services specifically designed for

413
00:18:14,539 --> 00:18:17,929
physical devices those are more

414
00:18:17,929 --> 00:18:20,059
expensive than the first three but they

415
00:18:20,059 --> 00:18:23,029
do have I think trial or free plans I

416
00:18:23,029 --> 00:18:26,029
know IBM does have sort of a starter

417
00:18:26,029 --> 00:18:27,230
membership that you don't need a credit

418
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:29,510
card to sign up for and they give you

419
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:32,990
about like half a gigabyte of half a

420
00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:36,649
gigabyte of RAM which might be all you

421
00:18:36,649 --> 00:18:40,820
need or you can build your own cloud so

422
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:43,850
for plant ba i created an API that I

423
00:18:43,850 --> 00:18:44,960
hosted on the same

424
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,669
Intel Edison that was also getting

425
00:18:46,669 --> 00:18:49,820
information from the sensor so some of

426
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:52,779
my dependencies I used express I use

427
00:18:52,779 --> 00:18:56,390
HTTP obviously and i think as i

428
00:18:56,390 --> 00:18:57,919
mentioned before i was using the Trillo

429
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:00,919
twilio API to get text messages so i

430
00:19:00,919 --> 00:19:05,360
have the twilio an ode to leo mpm module

431
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:08,360
i'm also using body parser to read the

432
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:10,610
responses coming in from chilly oh and

433
00:19:10,610 --> 00:19:13,340
I'm also using a vente meteor i'm also

434
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:15,440
using events to just keep my code

435
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:20,480
organized so there are three main API

436
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,490
endpoints that I created one was the

437
00:19:22,490 --> 00:19:24,500
true Leo specific API endpoint so this

438
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:27,620
endpoint was what truly would send a

439
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:29,480
post request to each time a text was

440
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:32,419
received oh so I hosted all this in my

441
00:19:32,419 --> 00:19:34,880
local network but I used a tunneling

442
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:39,159
program to allow Trillia access to it

443
00:19:39,159 --> 00:19:42,320
the other endpoint I used was / lights

444
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,929
so each time plant bought detected low

445
00:19:44,929 --> 00:19:46,940
ambient light it would send a post

446
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:49,820
request to slash light and each time I

447
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:52,460
detected that had enough light it would

448
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:57,399
send a post request to has light and

449
00:19:57,399 --> 00:20:00,830
each time those endpoints were hit they

450
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:02,779
would admit an invite they would admit

451
00:20:02,779 --> 00:20:05,270
they would trigger an event and each

452
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:06,860
time those events were triggered

453
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:09,020
triggered certain metrics certain

454
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:11,210
messages showed up on the display on

455
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:16,580
platt pot or instead of building an API

456
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:17,899
you could just tweet everything and

457
00:20:17,899 --> 00:20:19,640
there are plenty of node plenty of

458
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:20,779
tutorials they'll teach you how to use

459
00:20:20,779 --> 00:20:24,289
node too often into Twitter and to send

460
00:20:24,289 --> 00:20:28,669
tweets from anything anywhere so let's

461
00:20:28,669 --> 00:20:30,919
tie everything together with code let's

462
00:20:30,919 --> 00:20:33,409
assume our smart dog part what we want

463
00:20:33,409 --> 00:20:35,179
to do with our smart dog is that oh I

464
00:20:35,179 --> 00:20:37,190
think poochie's getting kind of fat and

465
00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:39,020
I want to build a fitness tracker for

466
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:46,340
them so I have an accelerometer so here

467
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:49,279
I'm using Johnny Five the JavaScript

468
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:51,500
robot turmeric to communicate with the

469
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:54,590
sensors and i'm using requests the

470
00:20:54,590 --> 00:20:57,559
request mpm module to send post requests

471
00:20:57,559 --> 00:20:58,020
to my

472
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:02,310
api so in line 14 and line 12 we are

473
00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:04,470
initializing the board in line 14 is

474
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:06,450
when we start triggering all the logic

475
00:21:06,450 --> 00:21:07,890
when L the code has finished

476
00:21:07,890 --> 00:21:11,220
initializing so I set the pins in line

477
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:16,410
16 16 to 18 and each time the Excel time

478
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:17,940
the data from the accelerometer has

479
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:20,310
changed I'm doing stuff with it you will

480
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:22,290
notice online can you see those line

481
00:21:22,290 --> 00:21:24,810
numbers are you'll notice on line 7 that

482
00:21:24,810 --> 00:21:28,770
are created this log object so each time

483
00:21:28,770 --> 00:21:31,740
new data is coming in each time a new

484
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:34,980
data is coming in I'm adding a time

485
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:37,680
adding keyvaluepair so a time stamp and

486
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,720
the actual data object coming in from

487
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:42,300
the accelerometer and what I'm doing

488
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:44,280
with this log object is that I'm

489
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:46,830
actually detecting changes I'm

490
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:50,040
performing some mathematic a magical

491
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:51,960
mathematical formula detect on actual

492
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:54,600
things happening because with sensory

493
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,130
sensors can be a little bit too

494
00:21:56,130 --> 00:21:57,840
sensitive and I don't want false

495
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:01,200
positives oh by the way this is all

496
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,270
pseudocode and I haven't really tried it

497
00:22:03,270 --> 00:22:05,820
out but if you guys got working just let

498
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:11,520
me know oops so okay so we have the

499
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:14,700
accelerometer set up let's say we also

500
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:17,310
want to detect where the dog is like

501
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:20,400
translating around in the apartment here

502
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,920
i've set up i'm using the Eddystone

503
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:25,530
beacon skin sent at Eddie stone beacon

504
00:22:25,530 --> 00:22:30,900
scanner mpm module and in lines 39 241 I

505
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:33,030
am paying attention to whether or not a

506
00:22:33,030 --> 00:22:34,860
beacon has been found and if a beacon

507
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:38,580
has been found I am sending a API post

508
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:42,840
request I'm sending a post request to

509
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:44,850
our API Oh a note about creating your

510
00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:48,870
own API so in these examples I've posted

511
00:22:48,870 --> 00:22:51,120
the API locally on some machine

512
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,670
connected to the same Wi-Fi network as

513
00:22:53,670 --> 00:22:57,960
the IOT object but you can totally set

514
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,970
it up out there on the web on a server

515
00:22:59,970 --> 00:23:02,100
somewhere like a digital ocean droplet

516
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:05,370
or Heroku instance of issue with that is

517
00:23:05,370 --> 00:23:07,470
that you'll also have to add some

518
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:08,370
security or

519
00:23:08,370 --> 00:23:12,110
some rando IOT device can use your API

520
00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:14,670
and we don't want that because then

521
00:23:14,670 --> 00:23:16,710
we're just like repeating the mistakes i

522
00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:18,900
mentioned in the earth and earth earlier

523
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:21,870
in this talk so now that you have the

524
00:23:21,870 --> 00:23:24,150
tools to create your own smart dog to

525
00:23:24,150 --> 00:23:27,240
create any to make all your dumb stuff

526
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,910
smart go forth and connect everything
