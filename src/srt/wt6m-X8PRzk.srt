[Applause]

3
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:16,080
hi can you hear me

4
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:24,840
great better better okay so I'm this

5
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:29,789
nervous so I think have to read sorry

6
00:00:29,789 --> 00:00:32,460
for that but I just

7
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:34,680
we'll look in everybody's eyes in

8
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:41,670
between the lines okay so did she google

9
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:46,219
that this was not the answer I expected

10
00:00:46,219 --> 00:00:49,590
when I asked a senior developer for help

11
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:52,070
several times

12
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:55,680
hi my name is Castine and I was not born

13
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,969
as a developer 10 years ago when I

14
00:00:59,969 --> 00:01:02,039
changed my profession from character

15
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:04,140
animator to development

16
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:10,320
I started at zero I did Google a lot but

17
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,600
I didn't understand everything I was

18
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:15,180
reading maybe this happens to you

19
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:17,130
sometimes

20
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:21,600
so being someone who believes in there

21
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,619
are no stupid questions and it's not a

22
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:30,299
shame to ask the answer did she Google

23
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:33,180
that felt like standing in front of a

24
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:37,049
wall with the answer to my questions

25
00:01:37,049 --> 00:01:41,880
right behind it my insecurities as a

26
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:45,479
junior developer increased I doubted my

27
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:49,470
own beliefs at the beginning of my

28
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:51,750
journey in this profession I got to know

29
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:56,030
some developers I am very grateful for

30
00:01:56,030 --> 00:02:00,240
they did pairing with me they did code

31
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:04,350
reviews they had patience some of them

32
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:05,950
are here today

33
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:11,170
and but unfortunately the feeling of

34
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:14,170
being a junior surrounding by the

35
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:19,060
Almighty seniors remained and sometimes

36
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:25,240
I felt sorry for bothering others and

37
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,370
sometimes you have to drink some water

38
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:36,010
it's my throat in the road then I heard

39
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:39,550
about CSS classes a free whole day event

40
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:43,510
for everybody skill level I joined as

41
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:47,800
attendee and some something in my mind

42
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:51,239
changed I realized I was not alone

43
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:53,860
there were many other developers having

44
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:56,220
the same questions and struggles I

45
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:59,739
realized asking questions is not just

46
00:02:59,739 --> 00:03:04,300
okay it's good it might even have others

47
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:06,670
surrounding you and occurs encourages

48
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:12,489
them I realize that if the developer who

49
00:03:12,489 --> 00:03:17,860
knows everything does not exist CSS

50
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:20,560
classes have been my first contact with

51
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:25,150
the community they are learned to have a

52
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:28,110
different view on my surroundings

53
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:31,120
by seeing coaches admitting that they

54
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,650
might not have the answer to my

55
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:35,829
questions right away and getting help

56
00:03:35,829 --> 00:03:38,230
from other coaches helped me a lot and

57
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:42,720
not taking my insecurities too serious

58
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,549

59
00:03:45,549 --> 00:03:50,230
