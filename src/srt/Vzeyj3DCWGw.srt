00:00:06,859 --> 00:00:09,360

okay thank you all for coming my name is

2
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,030
Anna I'm a freelance JavaScript

3
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:14,009
developer from Berlin but my background

4
00:00:14,009 --> 00:00:16,430
is actually in computational linguistics

5
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:20,010
computational linguistics is the science

6
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:22,199
of looking at natural language so the

7
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:24,240
stuff that we humans speak in a

8
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,369
mathematical way trying to find patterns

9
00:00:26,369 --> 00:00:30,349
and rules to do awesome stuff with it

10
00:00:30,349 --> 00:00:34,290
and this is what inspired this talk yeah

11
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:37,050
I want to talk about something called

12
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:39,840
the algorithmic beauty of plants so when

13
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,899
people talk about mathematical aspects

14
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:45,629
of plants and the beauty of nature you

15
00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:48,390
usually see those kind of images show up

16
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:51,660
circular shapes with easily recognizable

17
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:54,120
repeating patterns sometimes you even

18
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,340
see if you not see spiral drawn on top

19
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:59,390
of it to indicate the goal of national

20
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:01,890
somewhere in the plant whether this is

21
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:04,199
true or not but this is what people

22
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:06,960
usually talk about however in this talk

23
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,010
I would like to give you another

24
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:10,530
approach to seeing the mathematical and

25
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:13,770
algorithmic a beauty of plants and this

26
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:15,720
approach actually starts with the human

27
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:19,110
language so a common thing between

28
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:21,479
people of all cultures in the world is

29
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:23,479
that they use language to communicate

30
00:01:23,479 --> 00:01:27,200
while those languages vary wildly widely

31
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,130
there seems to be a common feature

32
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:33,180
connecting them so humans speak to each

33
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:35,549
other using languages they have

34
00:01:35,549 --> 00:01:39,150
different structures different words but

35
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:40,470
there are some similarities and this is

36
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:43,950
what linguistics is about so to give you

37
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:46,439
an introduction to how we linguist look

38
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:49,740
at language I say let's have a look at a

39
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:52,229
couple of English sentences and see if

40
00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:53,729
we can find out what makes them

41
00:01:53,729 --> 00:01:58,100
sentences so look at this sentence it's

42
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:00,509
called marika reviewed peters pull

43
00:02:00,509 --> 00:02:02,159
request that sounds like a wonderful

44
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:05,909
english sentence to us however if we

45
00:02:05,909 --> 00:02:08,429
rearrange the word pull request marika

46
00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:10,709
peters reviewed doesn't sound like an

47
00:02:10,709 --> 00:02:13,520
english language so if you

48
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,780
have another native language than

49
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:17,240
English or German maybe a non-european

50
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:20,120
language this word structure might make

51
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:22,670
sense to you but for English and German

52
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:25,000
speakers it usually doesn't

53
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,830
so another sentence that isn't really a

54
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:29,540
sentence is something like jessica talks

55
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:31,760
about there's something missing in the

56
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,860
english language so our brain gives us

57
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:36,050
this kind of error message when we

58
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:38,960
listen to that and you laugh with error

59
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,840
message but actually we can observe

60
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:42,820
something like this

61
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:45,500
so when linguist try to figure out what

62
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,780
makes the sentence grammatical for

63
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:50,210
speakers they have a couple of

64
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:53,660
techniques techniques to check that one

65
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:55,850
technique uses eye tracking so when we

66
00:02:55,850 --> 00:02:59,840
read a sentence like this the test

67
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,700
subjects eyes go back to the front of

68
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:03,890
the sentence furiously looking for that

69
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:06,980
missing information you even can put on

70
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:11,030
an EKG to measure the brain waves and

71
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:12,620
you see that there's a spike in it when

72
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:15,740
a sentence is ungrammatical so this is

73
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:17,800
really interesting

74
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:20,750
the first sentence had a word order that

75
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:23,330
we perceived as non grammatical this

76
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:26,810
sentence seems to be missing a word but

77
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:28,880
then there are sentences where our brain

78
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,650
doesn't throw an error message in a

79
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:33,440
grammatical way for example this

80
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,750
sentence colorless green ideas sleep

81
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:39,770
furiously it is a perfectly valid

82
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:41,810
English sentence but it doesn't make any

83
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:42,230
sense

84
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:44,720
so we laugh about that but we don't get

85
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:49,220
that error message thrown so there seem

86
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:51,020
to be some rules that we can break and

87
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:52,520
still maintain an English sentence and

88
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:57,830
some that we can't and we want to figure

89
00:03:57,830 --> 00:03:59,930
out what is it that makes a sentence a

90
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:02,810
valid English sentence in that case the

91
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:06,709
fun thing is its grammar some of you had

92
00:04:06,709 --> 00:04:09,680
grammar studies in in school and they

93
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,630
were taught some basics about their

94
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:14,620
native language some didn't in

95
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:17,570
linguistics a grammars just a set of

96
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:19,580
structural rules that tell us how a

97
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:21,440
sentence a phrase so sometimes in the

98
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,720
word may be composed so it has nothing

99
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:27,020
to do with so called press

100
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:29,479
prescriptive grammar where we say what

101
00:04:29,479 --> 00:04:31,729
rules make a nice sentence and if you

102
00:04:31,729 --> 00:04:33,560
say that you're teachable if you say the

103
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,180
other one your teacher will say it's

104
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:38,300
wrong but really just figuring out what

105
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:40,069
throws the error messages in our brain

106
00:04:40,069 --> 00:04:45,119
and what doesn't um

107
00:04:45,129 --> 00:04:47,300
grammar has always been a part of

108
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:50,479
learning a language so even 100 years

109
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:51,770
ago when people were studying different

110
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:53,569
languages they looked at the grammar

111
00:04:53,569 --> 00:04:56,060
they looked at the word order to figure

112
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:58,240
out what is a good sentence and what not

113
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,830
looking at grammar and languages from a

114
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:02,690
mathematical angle actually started

115
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:06,740
happening in the 50s so for our approach

116
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:08,150
right now we just agree that the grammar

117
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:09,919
is a set of rules how words may be put

118
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:11,169
together

119
00:05:11,169 --> 00:05:15,229
not nice sentences not educated

120
00:05:15,229 --> 00:05:19,159
sentences but just valid sentences when

121
00:05:19,159 --> 00:05:20,690
I started started in the 50s that

122
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:23,030
actually started mainly with this person

123
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:26,360
it's called Noam Chomsky he used to be

124
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,550
very important theoretical ingres

125
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:31,060
nowadays he switched to politics and

126
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:34,370
philosophy but he laid the groundwork

127
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:36,800
for all mathematical approaches to

128
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:41,630
languages it went this far that we

129
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:42,949
actually call this kind of grammar

130
00:05:42,949 --> 00:05:46,729
Chomsky grandma or Chomsky systems and

131
00:05:46,729 --> 00:05:50,870
in a very short summary he says so the

132
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:53,800
grandma is a type of rewriting system

133
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,969
that contains rules that tell us how

134
00:05:55,969 --> 00:05:57,830
words may be put together to form a

135
00:05:57,830 --> 00:06:01,969
sentence so what is a rewrite system it

136
00:06:01,969 --> 00:06:04,340
might sound complicated but it's

137
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:07,539
actually just search and replace symbols

138
00:06:07,539 --> 00:06:11,080
now we for example have rules like this

139
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:14,930
it's an s and Aaron in a in a B and that

140
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:17,930
just means every occurrence of the

141
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:19,550
symbol on the left hand side is the

142
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:23,539
error so the S is replaced with a and B

143
00:06:23,539 --> 00:06:25,039
not the other way around

144
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:28,669
yes it's written here yeah you may be

145
00:06:28,669 --> 00:06:30,199
using already those kind of rewrite

146
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:32,599
systems if you use Auto format as like

147
00:06:32,599 --> 00:06:35,960
prettier that replace every double quote

148
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,279
with single quotes or the other way

149
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:40,460
around this is just a rewrite rule

150
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:42,530
more complex rule would be the second

151
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:47,300
one so only if the symbol a appears to

152
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:50,360
the left of B replace it with C or even

153
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,370
the third one if a and B appear together

154
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:57,169
replace them with C and this is just

155
00:06:57,169 --> 00:06:59,360
this is how a rewrite rule works it's

156
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:02,000
simple replace one thing with another

157
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,840
according to some logic and with us we

158
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,599
already can build as a grandma for human

159
00:07:08,599 --> 00:07:11,750
language so this is a simple sentence it

160
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:13,340
works nobody gets an error message

161
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:16,099
thrown jessica talks and we have two

162
00:07:16,099 --> 00:07:19,880
types of words in this sentence one is

163
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:20,570
called a noun

164
00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:23,270
jessica is a noun it's the word that

165
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:25,639
identifies a person an animal a place a

166
00:07:25,639 --> 00:07:29,449
thing or an idea um the other thing is

167
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:33,020
talks and this is a verb and the verb is

168
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:35,180
one of the main parts of any sentence or

169
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:37,159
any language you have you will always

170
00:07:37,159 --> 00:07:40,639
find verbs in languages they're like

171
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:46,009
functions i Jessica talks talking is

172
00:07:46,009 --> 00:07:48,400
kind of a function of the object Jessica

173
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,020
and they really tied the information

174
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:55,220
together that we're having hmm like a

175
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:57,080
real real sentence or a question cannot

176
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:59,449
work without a work they of course some

177
00:07:59,449 --> 00:08:01,580
exceptions but in general the verb is

178
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:04,969
the important thing this is how

179
00:08:04,969 --> 00:08:07,520
important these action parts of speech

180
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,009
are the verb signals an action and a

181
00:08:10,009 --> 00:08:12,289
chorus or state of being whether mental

182
00:08:12,289 --> 00:08:14,650
physical and mechanical

183
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:19,009
somehow there's an activity expressed so

184
00:08:19,009 --> 00:08:21,320
a simple rule for English sentence would

185
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:23,630
be a sentence is a noun followed by a

186
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:26,900
verb so we would have a rewrite rule

187
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:29,120
like this so have signed a symbol for a

188
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,770
sentence I could replace them with noun

189
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:33,829
and verb and this allows us some simple

190
00:08:33,829 --> 00:08:35,630
sentences like Jessica talks or

191
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:41,620
Florencia tenses but we reached the

192
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:44,000
borders of our grammar pretty fast with

193
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,350
just the dog barks or Florencia dances

194
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:51,740
with a broomstick and in linguistics we

195
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:53,240
call that grammar not expressive enough

196
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,650
so we need to add more

197
00:08:54,650 --> 00:09:00,200
to form a complete grammar so when we

198
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,610
have a sentence like Jessica talks about

199
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:05,050
machine learning we again see more nouns

200
00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:09,550
we see the verb that we had before and

201
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:13,040
we have a new word about which we call a

202
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:17,840
preposition this is the word word form

203
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,640
that links nouns pronouns and phrases

204
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,980
together in a sentence so to create a

205
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:25,460
new meaning so we remember this rule and

206
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:27,950
now sending us a noun and a verb we say

207
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:30,470
okay that's not enough so now we can

208
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:33,880
come up with something more expressive

209
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:37,190
now the word phrases come into that

210
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:40,580
corner phrases are just groups of words

211
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,980
that form a specific unit in a sentence

212
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:47,420
so noun phrase it's not just now like

213
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,430
Jessica can also be noun in an article

214
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:52,910
like the dog and the verb phrase is not

215
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:54,470
just the verb but all the information

216
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:56,480
that belongs to it so talks about

217
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:03,500
machine learning there are some elements

218
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:06,680
to form a grammars that we use so called

219
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:10,670
non-terminal systems symbols like noun

220
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:12,800
verb and prepositional word forms

221
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,340
terminal systems that are symbols that

222
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:20,870
are actual words in a set of rules when

223
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:23,870
we have a couple of rules we can use

224
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:27,050
them one after the other so we start

225
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:29,990
with the s we expanded to noun phrase

226
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:32,060
and verb phrase we expanded to noun and

227
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:34,250
verb phrase and so on you see that

228
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:35,660
there's a kind of tree structure

229
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:38,540
emerging from it and non-terminal

230
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:40,130
systems just appear in the inner notes

231
00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:42,320
and the terminal symbols and we'll learn

232
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:45,410
that at one point other leaves of the

233
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:52,360
tree and this is a simple grammar

234
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,740
applying the productions you can see on

235
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:56,330
the right hand side how that works and

236
00:10:56,330 --> 00:10:58,670
with that very simple grammar we can

237
00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:00,980
actually already form quite a lot of

238
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:03,350
sentences so the children talk about

239
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:05,510
jessica is developed sentence in just

240
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:08,390
our four to six row grammar

241
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:14,330
children sing with joy children sing etc

242
00:11:14,330 --> 00:11:17,240
and now the cool thing of grammars comes

243
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:21,200
into play we have we can generate

244
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,700
sentences with it

245
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:24,320
and if we write our grammar in a

246
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:27,020
specific way we can have an infinite

247
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:28,640
amount of sentences with just a finite

248
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:32,450
set of rules which is pretty cool so if

249
00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:34,040
we just add something that we call

250
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:41,210
adjectives so the children sing the big

251
00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:43,130
children sing the big funny children

252
00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:44,720
sing the big funny lovely children

253
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,000
seeing you can see that we can create an

254
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,070
infinite amount of sentences just by

255
00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:50,630
adding the rule that we allow adjectives

256
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:54,410
now and this is cool because we somehow

257
00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:57,410
seem to be able to harness an Internet

258
00:11:57,410 --> 00:12:02,020
group of sentences was just a few rules

259
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:05,360
this was a very quick run-through how

260
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,610
formal grammars for natural languages

261
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:11,060
work so they get the idea and the

262
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:12,590
knowledge that you need for the nice

263
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:15,260
things with a plant just a heads up if

264
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:17,660
we ever are interested in that you will

265
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:20,060
see that these small grammars are just

266
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:21,980
not expressive enough these were

267
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:25,280
so-called regular grammars but there is

268
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,810
something called context-free grammars

269
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:29,210
or context-sensitive grammars allow for

270
00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:33,050
more complex sentences that might escape

271
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:36,560
the simple rule set so now to this to

272
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:39,020
the plants there's another lovely person

273
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:42,020
called OST Linda Mya it's actually a

274
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:45,740
theoretical biologist and there's a nice

275
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:48,550
origin story how all this works together

276
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:51,560
he was teaching at a university and he

277
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:55,850
was working on describing the growth of

278
00:12:55,850 --> 00:12:58,610
algae actually so the plants in the

279
00:12:58,610 --> 00:13:00,980
water and it was thinking a lot about

280
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:03,890
that and he was passing a room where

281
00:13:03,890 --> 00:13:05,510
they were teaching theoretical computer

282
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:07,550
science and talking about the language

283
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:10,130
of grandma's so what kind of set of

284
00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:12,700
sentences is a specific grandma

285
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:16,640
producing and in theoretical computer

286
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:20,210
science it's denoted with L G and he

287
00:13:20,210 --> 00:13:21,980
just heard oh they're talking about L GL

288
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:22,250
dude

289
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:23,840
seems to be something that's my interest

290
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,940
because I'm looking at those plans and

291
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:28,850
he went into the class not knowing that

292
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:32,900
he was mistaken but from that class he

293
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:35,390
was watching learning about grammars and

294
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:37,700
rules it was actually able to develop a

295
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:41,480
theory based on that to describe plant

296
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:46,130
growth so these systems that he

297
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:48,680
developed are so-called L systems or

298
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:51,500
Lindenmayer systems and they describe

299
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,870
the behavior of plant cells to model the

300
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:56,630
growth process of plant development it

301
00:13:56,630 --> 00:13:58,520
started with the algae but later it was

302
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,950
more complex organisms and when you look

303
00:14:00,950 --> 00:14:02,930
at those plants you see that there's

304
00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:04,940
some kind of structure to it some kind

305
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:08,170
of rule it's not just based in the wild

306
00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:14,510
and its tree and having a grimmer gives

307
00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:16,310
us actually the possibility to describe

308
00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:19,340
something like this this is a simple

309
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:24,050
plant it grows and when we watch the

310
00:14:24,050 --> 00:14:25,790
different stages of the plant growth we

311
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:28,460
actually see that there's some sort of

312
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:30,710
system for it there's also some sorts of

313
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:33,440
repeating elements so we have a size one

314
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:36,050
leaf somewhere we have a stem we have a

315
00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:39,410
size two leaf or a size three leaf so

316
00:14:39,410 --> 00:14:41,380
from the first of the second plan

317
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:45,140
besides one leaf has been replaced by

318
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:47,780
two sides one leaves the second one the

319
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:49,100
two sides of one leaves have been

320
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:51,260
replaced by a stem and the two sides one

321
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:56,390
leaves so we can actually already see

322
00:14:56,390 --> 00:14:57,620
that there's some kind of rewriting

323
00:14:57,620 --> 00:15:02,720
could be going on when we talk about

324
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:08,000
linear systems we have two main elements

325
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,160
of our grammar so first we had those

326
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,750
terminal symbols and non-terminal

327
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:13,880
symbols and then let my assistants we

328
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:16,040
just have an axiom it's kind of the seed

329
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:19,160
of the plant so the starting word

330
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:22,040
so to speak and replacement rules that

331
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:28,430
describe how our plants grow and and the

332
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:30,770
linguistics grammar we applied one rule

333
00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:32,840
after the other and then from our

334
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:36,300
systems the rules are actually applied

335
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:39,480
altogether so on our first step we have

336
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,580
our seed our s and we have a rule that

337
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:44,700
says replace the S with L and s okay we

338
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:48,860
do that and then we have an L that says

339
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:52,950
replace it with SS R and we have an S

340
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:55,110
again so now the rule for the s and the

341
00:15:55,110 --> 00:16:02,550
L will apply as well every stage of rule

342
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:04,140
application is actually a different

343
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:06,060
plant and as developed plant so first we

344
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:07,980
have the seat then we have one leaf and

345
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:09,390
we have a couple of leaves and then in

346
00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:13,860
the end we have a tree and you see if

347
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:18,540
you write the rules the right way the

348
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:20,760
words the trees can be pretty big pretty

349
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:25,290
soon so to summarize it's a rewrite

350
00:16:25,290 --> 00:16:27,330
system we have the seat in the beginning

351
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:29,970
all rules applied at once and every step

352
00:16:29,970 --> 00:16:33,900
is a relative word or plant and the

353
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:36,090
final result we can actually translate

354
00:16:36,090 --> 00:16:39,510
into a visual here's the comparison to

355
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:43,140
the Chomsky gamez we have a root with a

356
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:45,810
non-terminal we apply our rules and in

357
00:16:45,810 --> 00:16:48,360
the end we have a valid sentence we

358
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:50,280
don't really need to translate it into

359
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:52,200
something visual unless we want to print

360
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,180
it on the screen our brain is

361
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:56,820
translating it to actual phonemes and

362
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:59,580
words in our mouth but with the

363
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:01,370
Lindenmayer systems we can actually

364
00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:03,840
translate it into anything we want and

365
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:06,600
an easy way to start with this is

366
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:08,010
something called turtle graphics

367
00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:10,890
I love turtle graphics as an explanation

368
00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:13,260
because just imagine there's a turtle

369
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:16,580
and in its mouth is a pen and the turtle

370
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:19,020
walks over a sheet of paper according to

371
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:22,110
some rules so we have if we have a word

372
00:17:22,110 --> 00:17:25,020
like this guess what mean draw straight

373
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:27,570
line L what mean turn left our word mean

374
00:17:27,570 --> 00:17:31,830
turn right so we start here supposed to

375
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:33,810
draw a straight line then there's a turn

376
00:17:33,810 --> 00:17:35,850
left another straight line

377
00:17:35,850 --> 00:17:38,790
turn right another turn right a straight

378
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:42,210
line turn left straight line this is

379
00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:46,070
turtle graphics and we can use them to

380
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:48,860
visualize our

381
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:52,610
plant words so we start with the seed

382
00:17:52,610 --> 00:17:54,830
have the set of rules and then we

383
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:56,600
translate the symbols with the meaning

384
00:17:56,600 --> 00:18:00,260
into something else I kind of put two

385
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:02,240
stalks together so I apologize for the

386
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:06,010
repeating slides but this is again

387
00:18:06,010 --> 00:18:08,870
symbols with the meaning translated into

388
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:12,620
turtle graphics so now we have a couple

389
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:16,070
of iterations where we use our rule sets

390
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:19,429
to create new stages so the first thing

391
00:18:19,429 --> 00:18:21,830
the axiom is just a straight line it's a

392
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:24,679
valid word if we have our rule applied

393
00:18:24,679 --> 00:18:27,950
one it's a very big rule we can see the

394
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:29,600
little triangle that we just had with a

395
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,570
turtle but even the second iteration

396
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:36,320
already shows us sorry I guess like a

397
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,480
fractal structure so all parts all

398
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:41,299
straight lines are replaced with that

399
00:18:41,299 --> 00:18:43,910
little triangle and grow and grow and

400
00:18:43,910 --> 00:18:47,450
grow turtle graphics is one thing wake

401
00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:50,030
translated to the other thing it's

402
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:52,460
basically whatever you want so the

403
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:53,929
biggest picture I think is surrender

404
00:18:53,929 --> 00:18:56,900
tonight in a frame which is a 3d library

405
00:18:56,900 --> 00:19:00,110
that you can use in VR settings the

406
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:02,960
upper right is just plain canvas and the

407
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:07,880
lower right is three JIS they actually

408
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:10,580
use the same grammar some with different

409
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:13,970
starting seeds but this is about it so

410
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:15,919
you can do quite interesting stuff with

411
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:19,580
it so for a more complex example which I

412
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:21,470
don't expect you to fully understand by

413
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:25,070
the code we only just have two rules but

414
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:28,070
one rule is pretty long the X is just a

415
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:30,770
placeholder to be used in other rules so

416
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:36,320
you can see that our plans our words

417
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,240
will be getting bigger and bigger and

418
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:44,980
bigger with every step and we can yeah

419
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:46,940
actually see what's happening with that

420
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:50,090
kind of rule so now it's praying time

421
00:19:50,090 --> 00:19:53,840
because I have to change my settings so

422
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:56,120
this is one of the trees rendered in

423
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:59,900
three.js as I said but here is a simple

424
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:02,000
small tree that uses the grandma that I

425
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,790
just showed you

426
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:08,060
it's rendered on on canvas so our rules

427
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:13,340
are actually just translated into canvas

428
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:17,270
operations so the rotation the saving or

429
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:19,760
restoring what's just actually drawing a

430
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:24,050
path to somewhere here we have three

431
00:20:24,050 --> 00:20:25,880
iterations right now and let's see what

432
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:28,730
happens if we apply the rule just one

433
00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:31,700
more time so once the read this is

434
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:33,530
actually five iterations now you can see

435
00:20:33,530 --> 00:20:38,990
that the word is enormous just by

436
00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:41,810
applying those two rules five times and

437
00:20:41,810 --> 00:20:43,370
we can actually see a tree that has been

438
00:20:43,370 --> 00:20:52,120
growing here c6 crushes the browser

439
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:56,600
no but it's getting too big for the tool

440
00:20:56,600 --> 00:21:01,460
tool to see you see and this is so

441
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:03,590
there's no really complex operations

442
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:05,780
involved that you need to describe how

443
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:07,910
to render this tree is just set of two

444
00:21:07,910 --> 00:21:10,040
rules and some translation into

445
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:12,830
something to visualize it and I find

446
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:15,410
that is pretty cool this library is

447
00:21:15,410 --> 00:21:17,870
actually not developed by me but by a

448
00:21:17,870 --> 00:21:20,510
person called Tom prover who was I think

449
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:24,590
was part of his master thesis he's not

450
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:26,360
here today but he's from Berlin so check

451
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:29,090
him out if you're interested

452
00:21:29,090 --> 00:21:36,590
so going back to my displays so although

453
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:39,560
this was a very complex thing for some

454
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:42,050
of you to understand probably it's even

455
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:44,750
not enough not expressive enough just as

456
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:46,280
simple grammars were not expressive

457
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:48,410
enough for our natural language we need

458
00:21:48,410 --> 00:21:52,160
to keep be more expressive for more

459
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:55,970
complex systems so for example there's

460
00:21:55,970 --> 00:21:59,090
some kind of randomness involved

461
00:21:59,090 --> 00:22:01,760
sometimes like depending on whether

462
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,890
there's a bird sitting on a tree when

463
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:06,650
it's trying to gross or not a tree can

464
00:22:06,650 --> 00:22:08,710
be growing in another direction

465
00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:11,170
depending where the Sun is coming from

466
00:22:11,170 --> 00:22:13,220
parts of the tree actually need

467
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:15,440
different rules than other parts of the

468
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,950
tree so we have something called

469
00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:18,840
so hashtag l-systems parametric

470
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:20,850
l-systems etc is very fun to play around

471
00:22:20,850 --> 00:22:22,800
with that if you're interested and

472
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:23,430
that's it

473
00:22:23,430 --> 00:22:25,620
thank you for your attention if you want

474
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:27,510
to look at anything from that these are

475
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:29,370
the search and in terms that might be

476
00:22:29,370 --> 00:22:32,040
interesting for you and let me know if

477
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,540
you want to talk about it I like talking

478
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:35,690
about languages

479
00:22:35,690 --> 00:22:36,420
[Applause]
