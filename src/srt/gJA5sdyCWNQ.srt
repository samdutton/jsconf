00:00:10,809 --> 00:00:14,360

hello everyone today I'm going to talk

2
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:16,189
about how I learned to CSS

3
00:00:16,189 --> 00:00:19,009
I'm also paranoid about my presentation

4
00:00:19,009 --> 00:00:22,519
malfunctioning half way so if you okay

5
00:00:22,519 --> 00:00:24,800
if you want to scan the QR code and load

6
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,869
the slides on your mobile device feel

7
00:00:26,869 --> 00:00:29,779
free to do so now I've talked to a lot

8
00:00:29,779 --> 00:00:32,360
of people about CSS and a number of them

9
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:34,129
have told me that they they don't like

10
00:00:34,129 --> 00:00:36,739
CSS that CSS is hard to wrap their head

11
00:00:36,739 --> 00:00:38,720
around so I'm gonna share with you how I

12
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:42,290
wrap my head around CSS now the purpose

13
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:44,930
of CSS is to make stuff on the web look

14
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:46,670
good I mean you can't have cascading

15
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:49,159
style sheets without spell right but I

16
00:00:49,159 --> 00:00:51,500
also see CSS as a means of creative

17
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:53,119
expression I mean some people like to

18
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:55,640
write some people paint some people make

19
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:59,809
music I like to CSS now as with any

20
00:00:59,809 --> 00:01:02,030
creative endeavor we need some

21
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:04,489
inspiration well the CSS specification

22
00:01:04,489 --> 00:01:06,320
if you print it out I don't know maybe

23
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,240
it's this thick so there's a lot of

24
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,670
stuff in there for us to explore and

25
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:13,490
play with many people myself included

26
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:16,580
write articles about CSS some of us even

27
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:19,610
write books so read those because they

28
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:21,500
usually come with code examples that you

29
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:22,880
can fork off and play around with

30
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:26,360
yourself podcasts now I'm sure a lot of

31
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:28,070
you commute in some way or another

32
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:30,260
I personally commute by bicycle so

33
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:32,090
there's not a lot of things I can do

34
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:34,250
with my hands or my eyes technically

35
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:35,750
this applies if you're driving as well

36
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:38,150
but your ears are free and there are a

37
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:40,400
lot of good web development podcasts out

38
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,260
there that discuss the latest trends

39
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:44,930
techniques new stuff which is perfect

40
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:47,150
for finding out about new stuff and also

41
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:49,159
discovering old stuff that you never

42
00:01:49,159 --> 00:01:53,090
knew existed and if you're anything like

43
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:55,370
me you might find confidence a tad

44
00:01:55,370 --> 00:01:57,800
expensive I mean maybe I'm up here

45
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,270
because I was too cheap to pay for a

46
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:03,620
ticket joking kind of and a lot of the

47
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:05,810
conference's including this one actually

48
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:08,750
put up videos of the talks online after

49
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:12,560
the fact so if you want to skip over the

50
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,150
face to face interaction with

51
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:16,040
like-minded people or the prospect of

52
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:16,730
meeting your

53
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:19,280
pelipper idols then go ahead just watch

54
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,530
the free videos online there's really a

55
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:23,659
ton of good content there and then just

56
00:02:23,659 --> 00:02:27,440
start building stuff now ooh no crap

57
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,750
oona credits once it is on her excellent

58
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,970
podcast PS you must subscribe to it

59
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:34,160
people go to conferences to get inspired

60
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,840
and learn about things that exist or

61
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,580
maybe an overview of how to use it but

62
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:38,900
then they really learn that thing that

63
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,220
technology when they go home and

64
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:42,200
practice it themselves so that's what I

65
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:45,379
hope that I can I can do today that at

66
00:02:45,379 --> 00:02:47,299
the end of the day at the end of all

67
00:02:47,299 --> 00:02:48,980
these excellent talks that you too will

68
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:51,140
be inspired to go home and CSS something

69
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:53,480
yourself but building stuff is not

70
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:55,459
enough you really ought to share what

71
00:02:55,459 --> 00:02:58,910
you've built with the world because well

72
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:00,620
you can do this in two ways you can

73
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:02,810
either write write about it or you can

74
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:04,579
talk about it because when you do that

75
00:03:04,579 --> 00:03:06,769
you're forced to explain stuff and this

76
00:03:06,769 --> 00:03:09,140
really makes you learn about what

77
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:13,340
exactly what's going on so who's this

78
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:14,750
person standing in front of you talking

79
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:17,150
about CSS I mean I should introduce me a

80
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:18,650
bit so my first name is swaging

81
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:19,879
I'm a self-taught designer and developer

82
00:03:19,879 --> 00:03:21,829
I work at a company called deep that and

83
00:03:21,829 --> 00:03:25,489
I write blog posts from time to time so

84
00:03:25,489 --> 00:03:27,650
I put some stuff recently and Here I am

85
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:29,959
sharing it with all of you because I

86
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:31,370
only have 15 minutes I'm just gonna

87
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:33,650
cover some key points only first up is

88
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:35,780
what I call over-the-top video buttons

89
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:38,000
so I watched a video of ether and more

90
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,950
cots excellent talk at an event part

91
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:42,139
earlier this year linked in this light

92
00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:44,540
and I was particularly enamored with his

93
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:46,069
demo demonstrating progressively

94
00:03:46,069 --> 00:03:48,169
enhanced radio buttons now one thing

95
00:03:48,169 --> 00:03:49,940
about conference talks is unless the

96
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:52,760
speaker is live coding the code snippets

97
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:55,250
that we show you are just a tiny snippet

98
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:57,410
of the key functionality I learned that

99
00:03:57,410 --> 00:03:58,730
the hard way because I was like oh

100
00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:00,379
there's not a lot of code here I could

101
00:04:00,379 --> 00:04:02,000
probably build this in half an hour

102
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,980
wrong took me at least I don't know

103
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:07,910
three days and maybe more but these are

104
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:10,400
cool takeaways I got from trying to

105
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,540
build this demo students which so here's

106
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:19,190
the demo so it's essentially just radio

107
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:21,349
buttons but there's some animation going

108
00:04:21,349 --> 00:04:23,539
on there's some sliding and some zooming

109
00:04:23,539 --> 00:04:25,490
you can clear your selection and

110
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:28,340
everything just slides back this is all

111
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:30,180
powered by CSS

112
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:32,850
javascript involved in this demo is to

113
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:34,770
add and remove classes so then there's

114
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:37,259
also this slight pause the animation

115
00:04:37,259 --> 00:04:39,479
thing Sarah actually touched on

116
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:42,060
animations earlier so the crux of this

117
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:45,479
demo is a technique called the check box

118
00:04:45,479 --> 00:04:47,639
hack so I'm sure all of us have built

119
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:49,740
HTML forms before and we should know

120
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:51,870
that form control elements like inputs

121
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:53,880
should have an Associated label element

122
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:56,039
so you can do this in two ways you can

123
00:04:56,039 --> 00:04:57,900
either have the label contain the input

124
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:59,580
or you can use the for attribute on the

125
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:01,650
label which points to the ID of the

126
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:03,509
input element I actually found out

127
00:05:03,509 --> 00:05:05,340
recently that the second method is

128
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:07,020
recommended because some assistive

129
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:08,849
technologies don't work properly with

130
00:05:08,849 --> 00:05:11,160
the wrapping method so now when you

131
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,139
click the label it's as if you clicked

132
00:05:13,139 --> 00:05:15,720
and checked the radio button and because

133
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,550
you can use images as part of the label

134
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:19,650
not only text you can actually get

135
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:22,889
really fancy with the label so then when

136
00:05:22,889 --> 00:05:25,320
a radio button or checkbox is checked we

137
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,509
have a check pseudo class that we can

138
00:05:27,509 --> 00:05:29,190
play with so together with some

139
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:32,099
combinators either sibling selectors or

140
00:05:32,099 --> 00:05:33,570
child selectors depending on how you

141
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:35,699
wrote your HTML we can have some fun

142
00:05:35,699 --> 00:05:38,190
with the state change so we can have

143
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:40,530
some animation as Sarah mentioned

144
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:42,960
earlier the way browsers work now there

145
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,340
are only two things that can be animated

146
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:47,639
cheaply transforms and opacity and both

147
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:49,199
of which I use in this demo so that

148
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:51,180
sliding thing that you saw earlier that

149
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:54,750
was translate X and I used it with some

150
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:57,030
end child selectors so my four options

151
00:05:57,030 --> 00:06:00,210
were laid out with flexbox actually in a

152
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:02,430
single row so they're only going to move

153
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:05,669
along the x-axis and the selected option

154
00:06:05,669 --> 00:06:07,889
always ends up in the second position so

155
00:06:07,889 --> 00:06:09,810
we can set up some positioning rules

156
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:13,080
using entrant selectors so if the first

157
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,789
option is checked it will always move

158
00:06:14,789 --> 00:06:17,280
one position to the right so I can use

159
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:20,310
translate X 100% to do that and for the

160
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:22,169
third and fourth they're always going to

161
00:06:22,169 --> 00:06:24,900
move one or two positions respectively

162
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:27,210
to the left so we'll use a negative

163
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:30,720
percentage for the translate X and then

164
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,820
there's the zooming bit so basically

165
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:34,860
what I have more two disks that were

166
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:36,720
stacked on top of each other along the

167
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,909
z-axis so if you peek into my source

168
00:06:38,909 --> 00:06:40,620
code you'll see some Z index rules

169
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:42,230
thrown in there

170
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:45,710
and the use of the knot selector here is

171
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:48,470
helpful because what happens is that the

172
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:49,940
stuff that you want to display when

173
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:51,830
checked is hidden from view at first and

174
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:53,960
I did this by setting the opacity to

175
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:57,140
zero and scaling it down to nothing so

176
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:58,940
when you check one option you want the

177
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:02,000
other three to disappear and the istrict

178
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,130
class is only added to the selector

179
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:06,380
option while the other three without end

180
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:09,100
up getting these height from view

181
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:11,840
properties because they are not is

182
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,690
checked so the classes that are prefixed

183
00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:16,820
with is are added and removed by

184
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:18,860
JavaScript and those were those are the

185
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:20,420
only things that the JavaScript is doing

186
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:23,840
in this demo and then transitions so

187
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,240
transitions or what pull this whole demo

188
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:29,870
together because without them your my

189
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:31,430
options will just jump into place

190
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:33,710
there's none none of that smooth you

191
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:36,380
know sliding and zooming and I use

192
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:38,060
transitions quite often I think it's

193
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:40,100
quite commonly used and but one thing

194
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:42,020
that I actually never used before this

195
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:44,090
demo is the transition delay property

196
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:46,640
and you use it to specify the amount of

197
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,440
time the browser waits from the time you

198
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:50,330
request the animation to when the

199
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:52,220
animation actually starts so it turns

200
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:54,800
out that very slight pause it's a 0.1

201
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,840
second pause actually does make a

202
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,820
difference so I have this demo up on

203
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:00,980
quote pen and you can fork it and mess

204
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,570
around with the timing just to see the

205
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:05,540
effect right so I watched another talk

206
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:07,760
now this talk was by Harry Roberts on

207
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:10,220
structuring your CSS it was great there

208
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:12,620
was some way involved the sandwich not

209
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:16,100
the trains but his point was your CSS

210
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:18,590
classes shouldn't be monolithic because

211
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:20,540
that's actually creating a single point

212
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:23,330
of failure so you handle layout

213
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:25,430
separately from component Styles and

214
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:28,010
have specialized JavaScript books so if

215
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:29,270
you change the visual style of a

216
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:31,190
component by maybe changing classes

217
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:32,450
you're not going to break any

218
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:34,310
functionality so that's the reason why I

219
00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:38,780
have this disparate classes here and

220
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:40,340
someone pointed out to me that I should

221
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:42,640
really make my demo keyboard accessible

222
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,900
well I'm gonna preface that I'm not very

223
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:47,390
good at accessibility right now so I'm

224
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:49,040
still learning from people like Chris

225
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,860
about how to do this well unfortunately

226
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:54,380
I couldn't come up with a solution for

227
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:55,730
making the checkbox heck

228
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:57,680
keyboard accessible so if any of you do

229
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,630
please come and talk to me about it

230
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:02,930
but the next best idea I had was to have

231
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:05,510
a toggle so you can turn the app you can

232
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:08,329
turn the animation off you can just fall

233
00:09:08,329 --> 00:09:10,910
back to a normal so this is just your

234
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:16,399
basic normal radio buttons and for those

235
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:17,750
of you who have actually never tried

236
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:20,089
navigating a forum with keyboard know

237
00:09:20,089 --> 00:09:21,980
that you use tap to jump between

238
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:24,110
elements you use the arrow keys to

239
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:26,420
navigate between options and if it's a

240
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:28,970
checkbox you use space key to select and

241
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:33,380
unselect your options so the source code

242
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:34,730
and the quote pen link if you're

243
00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:37,910
interested right so one more demo this

244
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:41,449
one is what I call a CSS album art so I

245
00:09:41,449 --> 00:09:43,760
came across this blog post by a designer

246
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,010
come musician he's called Scott Hanson

247
00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:47,959
and he was outlining his design process

248
00:09:47,959 --> 00:09:50,209
for album covers and I noticed that in

249
00:09:50,209 --> 00:09:52,430
his design for some of his covers was

250
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:54,820
pretty minimalist you know just shapes

251
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:58,010
shapes that can be created only using

252
00:09:58,010 --> 00:10:00,889
CSS so here's the demo and as you can

253
00:10:00,889 --> 00:10:05,660
see the the covers are really simply

254
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:08,750
just shapes so these are all created

255
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:10,760
using just ESS there's no images

256
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:15,139
involved and for some reason I thought

257
00:10:15,139 --> 00:10:17,779
that it'd be cool to try doing this in

258
00:10:17,779 --> 00:10:21,410
just with just one single diff so I

259
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:23,420
definitely needed some help with from

260
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:26,779
pseudo elements so when you have the you

261
00:10:26,779 --> 00:10:28,760
can use the before and the after pseudo

262
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,500
elements so now I have like a total of

263
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,600
three elements to play with the thing

264
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:35,149
about pseudo elements is that you it

265
00:10:35,149 --> 00:10:37,250
must have the content property in order

266
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:39,949
for it to work and the content cannot be

267
00:10:39,949 --> 00:10:42,260
blank you have to have at least empty

268
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:44,510
codes so zero elements are considered

269
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:47,630
inserted content so what what happens is

270
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:51,500
that sorry what happens is that it's not

271
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:54,170
visible in the pages source so ideally

272
00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:56,000
you don't want to have any critical

273
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
content that is inserted into your your

274
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,310
website in this way but for decorative

275
00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:03,019
things like what I'm doing right now I

276
00:11:03,019 --> 00:11:06,140
think it's it's it's still fine so here

277
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:06,470
we go

278
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:08,930
shapes with CSS so it's gonna start off

279
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:09,590
with something

280
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:12,860
simple this be a circle the

281
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:14,930
border-radius is obviously the key

282
00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:17,870
property here but one thing is I also

283
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:20,120
wanted to make my demo responsive so

284
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:22,040
none of that fixed with stuff no no

285
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:24,440
we're gonna use viewport units for this

286
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:27,620
so what viewport units are is these are

287
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:29,029
units that are relative to the height

288
00:11:29,029 --> 00:11:31,960
and width of your viewport and the V min

289
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:34,760
unit that I'm using here actually is

290
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:37,040
based on your current viewport width or

291
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,430
height depending on whichever is smaller

292
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:43,310
so next rape actually I want to talk

293
00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:45,740
about is a triangle so you can create

294
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:48,200
triangles with CSS using the border

295
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:51,020
property so unlike if unlike me you had

296
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:52,460
better things to do with your life

297
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:53,779
you've probably never done this before

298
00:11:53,779 --> 00:11:56,180
but say create a div of any size you

299
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:59,540
choose 200 pixels square for example and

300
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:01,790
then you apply a different color thick

301
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:04,279
border to each of the four sides so so

302
00:12:04,279 --> 00:12:06,440
maybe about 30 pixels you'll see that

303
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,270
the edges of the border actually meet

304
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:12,380
diagonally so now if your div does not

305
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:14,660
have a height or a width then you're

306
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:17,780
left with 4 triangles and so you see you

307
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:19,430
can have triangles of different

308
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:22,480
directions and with that we can create

309
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:27,260
different CSS triangles so for this case

310
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:29,750
it's a right facing triangle so all you

311
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:30,920
have to do is to make the adjacent

312
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:33,770
borders transparent so for this one my

313
00:12:33,770 --> 00:12:37,180
top and border are transparent while the

314
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:40,400
desired color is applied to the border

315
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,860
left you can even change the width of

316
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:46,220
the border to change the shape of your

317
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:49,370
triangle so the next shape is a

318
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:50,060
trapezium

319
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:52,370
I consider this a cop-out shape because

320
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:54,589
it's actually just a regular diff with

321
00:12:54,589 --> 00:12:57,620
it it just snipped off with CSS clip

322
00:12:57,620 --> 00:13:01,100
path CSS clip path uses the same polygon

323
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:05,180
syntax as SVG's and as CSS shapes with

324
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:07,220
each point being a coordinate relative

325
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:08,860
to the width and the height of the diff

326
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:12,200
unfortunately clip path is not supported

327
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,690
in any of the Microsoft browsers but

328
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:17,270
it's currently under consideration in

329
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:19,010
the masking module so I think you can

330
00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:20,649
probably vote for this

331
00:13:20,649 --> 00:13:25,959
we're okay this is a fun one so on some

332
00:13:25,959 --> 00:13:28,959
of the covers I'm gonna switch back you

333
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:32,610
can see a series of dots at the site so

334
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:34,139
not this one

335
00:13:34,139 --> 00:13:39,550
so those those series of dots those were

336
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:41,980
actually done using the what I call the

337
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:44,379
box shadow trick so I came across this

338
00:13:44,379 --> 00:13:46,720
fantastic site showcasing really

339
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,629
interesting single day of CSS creations

340
00:13:49,629 --> 00:13:51,009
and when I first saw it I was like

341
00:13:51,009 --> 00:13:54,279
that's not possible that how do you own

342
00:13:54,279 --> 00:13:56,230
or do you actually do that with one div

343
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:58,329
turns out a lot of bit involved this

344
00:13:58,329 --> 00:14:00,670
particular trick so you know how I said

345
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:02,740
that the before and after a pseudo

346
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:04,389
element gave you two more elements to

347
00:14:04,389 --> 00:14:06,699
play with box shadow actually gives you

348
00:14:06,699 --> 00:14:09,249
I don't know unlimited more someone

349
00:14:09,249 --> 00:14:13,509
please correct me on this but the the

350
00:14:13,509 --> 00:14:16,360
limit the limitation here is that it can

351
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:18,459
only be one shape because I mean it's

352
00:14:18,459 --> 00:14:21,309
the shadow of something but the syntax

353
00:14:21,309 --> 00:14:23,649
is as follows and what you can do is you

354
00:14:23,649 --> 00:14:25,929
can use the offsets which are the first

355
00:14:25,929 --> 00:14:28,389
two values for positioning and the blur

356
00:14:28,389 --> 00:14:33,819
radius for sizing so for the album's

357
00:14:33,819 --> 00:14:36,339
there are 11 dots so it looks like that

358
00:14:36,339 --> 00:14:42,629
11.11 box shadows so that's that okay

359
00:14:42,629 --> 00:14:47,290
this one is purely grata to us because

360
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:48,910
my original code pen demo just had

361
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:50,769
everything aligned right smack down the

362
00:14:50,769 --> 00:14:53,410
middle using flexbox but then I came

363
00:14:53,410 --> 00:14:55,449
across an article by none other than

364
00:14:55,449 --> 00:14:58,059
Sarah Dresner talking about CSS scroll

365
00:14:58,059 --> 00:15:00,040
snapped I like why not I just you can

366
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,389
just throw this in it seems like a

367
00:15:01,389 --> 00:15:04,629
perfect East case for this so CSS scroll

368
00:15:04,629 --> 00:15:06,339
snap was actually introduced in for

369
00:15:06,339 --> 00:15:08,589
scroll positions so users don't land at

370
00:15:08,589 --> 00:15:10,629
awkward scroll positions that leave a

371
00:15:10,629 --> 00:15:13,019
page partially on screen when panning

372
00:15:13,019 --> 00:15:16,990
okay fine it's scroll jacking but I can

373
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:18,639
understand the reason for this use case

374
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:20,410
and it actually works kind of kind of

375
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:22,629
well with the keyboard but the

376
00:15:22,629 --> 00:15:25,089
specification is unstable yet and it

377
00:15:25,089 --> 00:15:27,459
only works on Firefox and surprisingly

378
00:15:27,459 --> 00:15:30,549
Microsoft edge but then it doesn't

379
00:15:30,549 --> 00:15:35,280
support clip path this is you know like

380
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:37,620
but the key property here for CSS

381
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:40,200
scrolls net is the scroll snap type on

382
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:43,680
the container and the scroll snap

383
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,050
coordinate on the inner element so this

384
00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:47,970
is the kind of thing that is really

385
00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:50,310
makes a lot of sense if you play around

386
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:53,070
with the code yourself so I've also have

387
00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:55,710
a code pen demo one thing about this is

388
00:15:55,710 --> 00:15:57,540
that if you look at the existing

389
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:00,390
polyfills that are around online I found

390
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:03,390
two but they both only support the older

391
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:05,370
syntax so they don't work very well

392
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:07,710
CSS scroll snap only works natively on

393
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:12,480
as I said Firefox and itch so the source

394
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:16,320
code and the code pen link is here one

395
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,520
thing to note about trying out the

396
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:19,350
latest and greatest is to always check

397
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:21,810
with can I use com just to see how

398
00:16:21,810 --> 00:16:25,320
browser support is but that being said

399
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:28,410
there's never been a better time to then

400
00:16:28,410 --> 00:16:30,510
now to live on the cutting edge because

401
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:32,610
evergreen browsers are a thing now and

402
00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:35,910
we don't have to wait six months for a

403
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:37,130
new feature

404
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:42,060
Safari so here's all the related reading

405
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:44,400
in more or less the order that I talked

406
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:47,460
about them really good stuff suggest

407
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:48,930
that you go through this when you have

408
00:16:48,930 --> 00:17:02,150
time and that's it for me
