1
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:44,280

I'm really convinced about is that in

2
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:46,649
the next couple of here we will see a

3
00:00:46,649 --> 00:00:48,629
lot of 3d games

4
00:00:48,629 --> 00:00:50,819
I mean Triple A games running on the

5
00:00:50,819 --> 00:00:55,319
browser right now with the initiative of

6
00:00:55,319 --> 00:00:58,769
for instance musiah with SMGs and some

7
00:00:58,769 --> 00:01:02,489
stuff we're also doing with IE we are

8
00:01:02,489 --> 00:01:04,979
pushing the limit of the web and without

9
00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:08,189
plugin just by using a WebGL we'll be

10
00:01:08,189 --> 00:01:11,399
able to have really great games that's

11
00:01:11,399 --> 00:01:13,860
why with some friends of mine we decided

12
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:16,229
to create something to add web

13
00:01:16,229 --> 00:01:18,930
developers creating games without having

14
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:23,460
to deal with math shaders WebGL plumbing

15
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:26,369
which is a bit annoying we wanted to

16
00:01:26,369 --> 00:01:28,229
have something really really simple I

17
00:01:28,229 --> 00:01:29,939
mean we wanted to have something that

18
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:33,170
can allow you guys to create a game and

19
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:36,030
just focus on the game and not the

20
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:38,549
plumbing we create for that

21
00:01:38,549 --> 00:01:41,039
Babylon's yes and for the next 20

22
00:01:41,039 --> 00:01:44,130
minutes I will try to shrink my time we

23
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:46,530
will I will show you how to use it

24
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:48,750
my name is David k2 I'm working for

25
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:52,200
Microsoft and I will do three crazy

26
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:56,340
things I will use Windows I will use IE

27
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:03,390
and I will use Visual Studio so yeah it

28
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:08,580
will be just different here is my handle

29
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:10,590
at Delta crush feel free to contact me

30
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:12,540
on Twitter and my email is there and my

31
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:14,760
blog is here so first of all I would

32
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:15,270
like to show

33
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:18,780
you owe to use Babylon Jia's so let's

34
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:28,550
move here try to sounds good

35
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:32,670
okay so just I just did visual Co to

36
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:35,790
have some kind of look whole web web

37
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:36,630
server

38
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:39,510
okay so the only thing I need is to

39
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:43,260
create a website it's not related to

40
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:45,390
visual studio I'm joking you can use

41
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:48,120
whatever you want just as long as you

42
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,520
have a web server so let's just use a

43
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:54,180
blank website here and I would just drop

44
00:02:54,180 --> 00:03:02,220
in double NGS treat oh that's

45
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:02,880
interesting

46
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:06,030
you can't see it okay let's duplicate it

47
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:14,190
should be great a better yeah sounds

48
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:20,760
good guys okay so I will just had a web

49
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:25,050
page let's find a web page right there

50
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:30,840
and I will call it index that HT in this

51
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,420
web page I just had here the villains

52
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:37,250
yes the only thing you need is a canvas

53
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:43,780
who is we already played with WebGL here

54
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:47,660
okay let's say 5% okay

55
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:52,890
absolutely I can is it powerful

56
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:57,510
yeah it's Visual Studio did I mention

57
00:03:57,510 --> 00:04:02,220
that so let's call it canvas and what I

58
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:05,370
want to do err just had some CSS quickly

59
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:08,550
just to be sure that my canvas will use

60
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:14,459
all the screen so HTML body and canvas

61
00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:22,470
will be full screen and 100% with same

62
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:25,830
thing 8 sorry about that it's just to

63
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:27,350
have something

64
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:29,360
really beautiful to see you to show you

65
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:33,770
okay sounds good and what I want to do

66
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:39,640
here let's close that it's at the script

67
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:42,800
and in the script I will just create an

68
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:47,570
engine an engine is for you the best

69
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:50,690
tool to not deal with WebGL the engine

70
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:53,720
will do everything related for to WebGL

71
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,670
for you so you just have to create a new

72
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:59,030
Babylon dot engine object right there

73
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:07,470
give it the canvas let me grab it

74
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:13,640
yep and canvas canvas okay and use it

75
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:16,670
here when you treat the engine the

76
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:18,080
second thing you have to do is create a

77
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,180
scene the scene is the container or

78
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:21,950
everything you want to display on your

79
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:26,000
screen so it's like in in movies let's

80
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,910
create a new bubble on that scene and

81
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:31,640
the scene only need to know who is the

82
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:34,940
engine once the scene is created you can

83
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:36,770
treat a camera so the cameras view is

84
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:38,870
your point of view where are you in the

85
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:41,060
scene there is a lot of camera there are

86
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:42,770
a lot of different camera in babylons

87
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:46,580
yes I will use a rack rotate camera the

88
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:48,560
architect amira is a camera that will

89
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,410
rotate around a central pivot okay so

90
00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:52,730
it's really convenient to for instance

91
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:56,420
look into some specific object it's new

92
00:05:56,420 --> 00:06:04,390
Babylon that arc rotate rotate camera

93
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:08,780
let's give it a name like camera to

94
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:11,120
value this is a different angle there is

95
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,680
two angle to position an object on a

96
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:15,200
sphere I could add alpha and beta so

97
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,720
let's say 0 the reduce of the speed of

98
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:21,110
the sphere let's say 10 and the center

99
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:23,810
which is the center of the pivot it will

100
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:28,880
be here Babylon that vector of 3.0 and

101
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:32,750
finally the scene once the camera is

102
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:36,169
created we can ask the camera to get all

103
00:06:36,169 --> 00:06:38,630
the control on new canvas I mean all the

104
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:41,290
input church mouse whatever

105
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:43,510
we'll be under by the camera if you want

106
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:45,100
to adjust to do some gesture to

107
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:46,570
pinch-to-zoom whatever the camera will

108
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:48,160
take care of that for you and we'll move

109
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,440
accordingly so the camera just have to

110
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:54,390
call attach attach control on the canvas

111
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:57,670
then we need a light so let's create

112
00:06:57,670 --> 00:07:00,930
something like a small stone which is a

113
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:06,040
babylon dot point light this point light

114
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:09,940
should have a name light will also have

115
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:15,160
a position it's just a point dot and we

116
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,110
are in 3d so we need the vector three

117
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:24,210
it's X Y Z let's put it in say for us

118
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:28,960
somewhere there and always the scene so

119
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,370
we have the camera we have the light the

120
00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:32,590
missing stuff is an object it's create a

121
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:39,760
sphere it's double on that mesh that

122
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:44,680
creates fear so sphere has a name it has

123
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:47,020
a definition remember that you are

124
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:48,910
walking with 3d so everything is based

125
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:52,000
around triangle even a sphere so if you

126
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,350
want to create a sphere we have to

127
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:55,210
define the desolation which means all

128
00:07:55,210 --> 00:07:58,720
mini triangle what the definition was

129
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,370
the resolution of our sphere so let's

130
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:03,760
bathe on 32 the radius of the sphere

131
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:07,570
will be let's say 3 and the scene and

132
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:11,170
that's it the scene is complete what we

133
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:13,870
need right now is to ask the scene

134
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:17,950
Trender as fast as possible ok and on

135
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:19,600
modern browser we have something called

136
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:22,000
requestanimationframe which handle that

137
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,740
for you each time the browser wants to

138
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:26,170
display your frame it will call you will

139
00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:27,730
do what you want to do and then the

140
00:08:27,730 --> 00:08:30,430
browser will display your frame on

141
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:32,500
browser that doesn't support that you

142
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,390
can use a timeout for instance so just

143
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:36,729
to be convenient here we can ask just

144
00:08:36,729 --> 00:08:39,790
the engine to run the render loop which

145
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:43,510
is the technical term with the anonymous

146
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:45,970
function and during this function the

147
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:47,740
only thing we want to do is just call

148
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:50,800
one there on the scene and I think I'm

149
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:51,840
done

150
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:54,440
if there is no bug

151
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:58,970
oh it's a sphere the bad idea is that a

152
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:02,090
rook hotate come around a spherical

153
00:09:02,090 --> 00:09:04,250
object so you won't see when I move you

154
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:07,190
just just see the light moving a bit but

155
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:09,920
I when I move with my mouse and I

156
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,380
retired around my sphere what I can do

157
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:14,140
right now it just adds some texture

158
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:17,390
let's play with that quickly and we let

159
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:21,050
this one and this one because right now

160
00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:25,090
the sphere is a bit let's say simple the

161
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:28,760
material is for you the convenient the

162
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:31,550
convenient way to not deal with shaders

163
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:34,310
I will go back to that after but right

164
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:37,700
now I just have to declare a new double

165
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:43,580
on that standard standard material this

166
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:46,130
material will have a name and a scene

167
00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:53,170
and the sphere will use it as a material

168
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:56,810
okay the material we allow you to create

169
00:09:56,810 --> 00:09:59,450
shaders without having to code the

170
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:01,250
shaders for instance I want to use a

171
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:03,770
diffuse texture the diffuse texture is

172
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:05,360
the texture that will be used for the

173
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,760
basic color of the object according to

174
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:08,270
the light

175
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:10,010
okay so right now the object is white

176
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:12,350
when the light is on it it's white where

177
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:14,180
there is no light is black okay and

178
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:16,280
right now I want to have an object a bit

179
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:18,530
more complex I want to use texture to

180
00:10:18,530 --> 00:10:20,480
define the core of the object where the

181
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:24,320
light light it so it's a new Babylon

182
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:31,130
that texture the texture is html5 dot

183
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:34,640
PNG which is in my project and the scene

184
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:39,190
is just to see far better we have

185
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:43,400
something interesting the light is a

186
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:46,160
specific position and the light is not

187
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,440
moving I'm just rotating my camera

188
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,480
around the object what I can do quickly

189
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:54,470
is just use my render loop here to say

190
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:57,680
that light that position is equal to

191
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:03,410
camera position position so the light

192
00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:06,530
will be on my head like this so when I

193
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:07,580
move

194
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:10,340
the light will move with me interesting

195
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:13,700
what can I decide also and I have plenty

196
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:16,040
of options right there but I can decide

197
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,480
that the diffuse texture right there

198
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:20,540
which is a PNG and so the texture

199
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:25,970
contain alpha I can define that alpha is

200
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:30,020
enable so the shaders we understand that

201
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:33,170
when there is an alpha value equal to

202
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:38,230
zero the pixel let's not be drawn okay

203
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:41,210
just by adding this line the object

204
00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:45,170
right now is not a complete sphere and

205
00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:47,330
as you can see Babylon GS is removing

206
00:11:47,330 --> 00:11:49,730
the back face just to be sure that we

207
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:51,560
don't display too much faces but in this

208
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:53,720
case we need to display the best the

209
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:57,830
back face so I just asked the material

210
00:11:57,830 --> 00:12:02,320
back face culling to disable that fault

211
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:06,500
and then I can see inside my object I

212
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:09,740
can go further and I can add something

213
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:12,470
name the bump if you are a gamer the

214
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:15,020
bump texture or normal map is something

215
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:18,140
really used it's a technical way to

216
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:21,380
simulate a volume without having to deal

217
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:24,380
with triangle in fact the object is only

218
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:27,260
a two triangle really simple but with a

219
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:29,450
texture applied on it we can simulate

220
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:31,670
the modification of the light we call

221
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:34,190
that the bump it's a bit complex if you

222
00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:37,820
want to develop that but with double NGS

223
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:39,170
you just have to say that the burn

224
00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:43,820
texture same way is a new texture that

225
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:46,070
we can use here and this time the name

226
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:55,310
is normal normal map dot jpg and as you

227
00:12:55,310 --> 00:12:58,880
can see we can fill the volume nothing

228
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,250
different on the geometry side this is

229
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:04,460
the same object which I can play with

230
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:08,060
the touch obviously and as you can see

231
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:11,120
we feel the volume because the light is

232
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:14,060
not perfectly applied the surface of the

233
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:17,150
object there is some scratches and we

234
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:22,180
can fill the volume all right

235
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:35,950
back to the slides not a good idea right

236
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:39,240
if you are like me I hate learning new

237
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:42,090
things using documentation I know that

238
00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:44,010
lots of people spend a lot of time

239
00:13:44,010 --> 00:13:46,290
writing documentation but I ate that I

240
00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:48,960
really ate that I prefer experimenting

241
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:51,540
I prefer learning and trying my new toys

242
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:53,880
on some kind of sandbox of things like

243
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:58,170
that as a developer I think I have to

244
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:01,470
switch again to duplicate sorry about

245
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:02,420
that

246
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:05,430
yeah as the developer I created for you

247
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:11,430
a tools call the playground let's go

248
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:13,440
with it you can experiment it right now

249
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,790
it's under LMGs dot slash playground

250
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:20,280
it's a place where you can try specific

251
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:22,680
gg-get features without having to deal

252
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:26,640
with creating an HTML and XHTML hmm

253
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:40,130
sounds like I could use my local version

254
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:43,200
as you can see here oh that's great okay

255
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:47,730
grant no problem with that let's go to

256
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:55,110
the playground you should have the same

257
00:14:55,110 --> 00:15:05,080
thing online almost my network is just

258
00:15:05,090 --> 00:15:12,060
broke down yeah I know trying to make it

259
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:18,670
work I'm sorry guys

260
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:28,900
what a wonderful demonstration No

261
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:34,380
I'm connected

262
00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:44,250
just for your pleasure okay

263
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:48,340
so let's imagine the playground looked

264
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:51,040
like this stuff it's a place where you

265
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:53,620
can on the left side you have some kind

266
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:56,290
of editor where you occurred editor

267
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:57,880
where you can type in and select

268
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:00,760
whatever you want to do and you can just

269
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:02,920
try it immediately because the right

270
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:05,340
side of the application is just live

271
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:08,950
example of what you just code and I

272
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:26,650
would have loved to make it work

273
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:31,580
oh thanks good okay so yeah this is the

274
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:34,730
best tip of my demonstration so here you

275
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:36,410
have a playground where you can see and

276
00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:38,150
just on the left side you see that you

277
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:39,800
can create a camera a touch control cat

278
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,930
light just what I did and just try

279
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:44,900
things each time you want to learn new

280
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:46,400
thing we have some kind of tutorial

281
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,110
right there for instant let's play with

282
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:53,390
shadows okay so as you can see loading a

283
00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:56,240
set okay it's okay so you just have this

284
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,550
kind of environment it's a night map

285
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:00,950
it's a plane deform using a texture and

286
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:04,550
there is a donut flying with two shadows

287
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:06,230
which is the interesting pattern of the

288
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:09,050
flying donuts and all the code is here

289
00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:12,290
it's less than 30 lines of code we

290
00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:16,640
really try are to be sure that each time

291
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,770
you want to do something it's with the

292
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:23,720
minimal amount of code you can go in

293
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:25,730
some kind of advanced mode if you want

294
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:27,470
you can deal with shadow you can deal

295
00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:30,070
with everything related to WebGL but for

296
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:33,260
that the beginner of the other people

297
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:35,210
that don't want to mess with that you

298
00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:37,850
just have to stick with the first level

299
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:40,130
API here you can see I create two lights

300
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:43,670
each light some specific stuff around

301
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:46,100
shadow which is they're called shadow

302
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:47,570
which in a retro cell and the shadow

303
00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:49,700
generator will do everything for you in

304
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:51,530
we generate the map apply it on the

305
00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:54,680
object you do everything for you all

306
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:55,660
right

307
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:58,280
you can also quit I'm sorry about this

308
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:00,440
presentation it's easy because each time

309
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:02,030
it change the resolution you can also

310
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:04,130
deal with shadows it's the interesting

311
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:08,110
part shadows can allow you to go really

312
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:11,960
deep into eye quality visual I mean you

313
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:16,070
can create things like that with a new

314
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:19,760
tool called CY OS which means create

315
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:25,730
your own shader okay it's this time you

316
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:27,800
will have specific object sphere

317
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:32,810
tohru's my prophetic not and you just

318
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:34,880
have you know the vertex shader and the

319
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,940
pixel shader and using this small amount

320
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:40,039
of code which will be

321
00:18:40,039 --> 00:18:43,309
heute hit on the GPU side its GLSL it's

322
00:18:43,309 --> 00:18:45,889
a specific language it look like see you

323
00:18:45,889 --> 00:18:49,190
can explain to the GPU all each pixel

324
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:52,609
are rendered and if you want to play

325
00:18:52,609 --> 00:18:55,789
with that there is some sample here the

326
00:18:55,789 --> 00:18:58,389
basic one is just reading the texture

327
00:18:58,389 --> 00:19:02,659
then we can go a bit complex and adding

328
00:19:02,659 --> 00:19:05,450
some kind of black and white and adding

329
00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:08,350
cell shading like in video game and

330
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:11,149
phone which is the name of the guy that

331
00:19:11,149 --> 00:19:14,479
find oh the light equation is defined

332
00:19:14,479 --> 00:19:16,669
and bla bla bla bla bla and you can play

333
00:19:16,669 --> 00:19:18,619
with some kind of any things like the

334
00:19:18,619 --> 00:19:22,070
the wave everything sorry everything is

335
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:25,519
just GLSL is just shader code and if you

336
00:19:25,519 --> 00:19:28,639
want to do that guys you can experiment

337
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:34,820
using CIOs and then you can use it on

338
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:37,239
your own code and I prepare for you a

339
00:19:37,239 --> 00:19:45,619
specific sample right there so same same

340
00:19:45,619 --> 00:19:48,019
story I just reference babylons yes and

341
00:19:48,019 --> 00:19:51,639
there I create a script with the type

342
00:19:51,639 --> 00:19:54,169
which is not JavaScript just to be sure

343
00:19:54,169 --> 00:19:56,690
that the browser don't want to compile

344
00:19:56,690 --> 00:19:56,960
it

345
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,999
it's the code that I could be passed

346
00:19:58,999 --> 00:20:01,849
from there the first one here and the

347
00:20:01,849 --> 00:20:03,379
second one the FairTax and the pixel

348
00:20:03,379 --> 00:20:06,799
shaders I put them here and then I do

349
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:08,210
the same thing in credit canvas and

350
00:20:08,210 --> 00:20:09,590
Engine has seen the light tutor Wizard

351
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:11,359
cam and the material I use right there

352
00:20:11,359 --> 00:20:13,849
is a shadow material meaning you take

353
00:20:13,849 --> 00:20:16,309
the control over all a pixel is defined

354
00:20:16,309 --> 00:20:18,349
you have to create the shadowed put that

355
00:20:18,349 --> 00:20:19,940
code into your page and just choose the

356
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:26,450
subject so if I run this page my donut

357
00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:29,929
here I apply on it some kind of cartoon

358
00:20:29,929 --> 00:20:34,009
red effect just by creating the shadow

359
00:20:34,009 --> 00:20:34,909
material right there

360
00:20:34,909 --> 00:20:36,859
we try to keep things simple you just

361
00:20:36,859 --> 00:20:39,049
have to mess with WebGL you just define

362
00:20:39,049 --> 00:20:41,570
out salaries and all the stuff all the

363
00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:48,419
plumbing is done then

364
00:20:48,429 --> 00:20:50,679
you can see here it's some kind of

365
00:20:50,679 --> 00:20:52,419
developer demonstration I mean it's a

366
00:20:52,419 --> 00:20:55,029
sphere donuts okay if you want to treat

367
00:20:55,029 --> 00:20:57,159
a game unless you have some great idea

368
00:20:57,159 --> 00:20:59,669
we've done it and sphere it will be

369
00:20:59,669 --> 00:21:02,679
limited let's say you will have to work

370
00:21:02,679 --> 00:21:05,919
with graphics or 3d artists and to do

371
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:09,429
that they won't use sublime text visual

372
00:21:09,429 --> 00:21:11,320
studio whatever they will use their own

373
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:14,230
DCC they will use their own data

374
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:18,129
creation tools and one of them is

375
00:21:18,129 --> 00:21:21,399
blender it's a free open-source project

376
00:21:21,399 --> 00:21:23,799
extremely powerful where you can treat

377
00:21:23,799 --> 00:21:27,909
really beautiful scene we decided to

378
00:21:27,909 --> 00:21:30,279
support blender and to do that it's

379
00:21:30,279 --> 00:21:32,220
pretty easy let me just read something

380
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:35,769
the best I can do is create a monkey

381
00:21:35,769 --> 00:21:38,679
head it's easy for the record this

382
00:21:38,679 --> 00:21:41,590
monkey head name is Susan I don't know

383
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:44,980
why and as you can see there is a camera

384
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:46,899
right there so it's perfect there is two

385
00:21:46,899 --> 00:21:49,860
object I will just had a plane here I

386
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:53,200
will zoom it to be sure it's a ground

387
00:21:53,200 --> 00:22:00,220
for me okay and what we did we added

388
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:04,360
some specific functionality into blender

389
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:09,580
to allow you to control up specific

390
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:13,749
properties and when you want you just

391
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:16,539
want to export Babylon GS file right

392
00:22:16,539 --> 00:22:20,139
there and you just have to load it into

393
00:22:20,139 --> 00:22:22,929
your page so let me just select

394
00:22:22,929 --> 00:22:30,549
something here I'm not really okay here

395
00:22:30,549 --> 00:22:33,129
you can see some specific double NGS

396
00:22:33,129 --> 00:22:35,169
features for instance for my ground

397
00:22:35,169 --> 00:22:38,619
I want my ground to check collision

398
00:22:38,619 --> 00:22:40,869
meaning I don't want the camera to go

399
00:22:40,869 --> 00:22:42,820
through the subject I want the camera to

400
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:46,149
consider it as a solid object okay then

401
00:22:46,149 --> 00:22:50,070
for my camera right there I also want to

402
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:54,009
have collision and gravity and the

403
00:22:54,009 --> 00:22:56,999
gravity is like in on earth it's don't

404
00:22:56,999 --> 00:23:00,639
going down then on the monkey Edie I

405
00:23:00,639 --> 00:23:02,080
will add

406
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:05,039
seeing different I will as physics I

407
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:09,669
want the ad to use the physic engine and

408
00:23:09,669 --> 00:23:12,850
be considered as box for instance with a

409
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:16,299
mass of 1 and for the cube I will do the

410
00:23:16,299 --> 00:23:18,610
same thing I would consider it as a box

411
00:23:18,610 --> 00:23:22,630
with a mass of 1 and the ground I will

412
00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:25,269
consider it as a box but I don't want

413
00:23:25,269 --> 00:23:27,100
the ground to fall down I want the

414
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:30,130
ground to remain where is it to remain

415
00:23:30,130 --> 00:23:32,500
static so I just defined a mass of 0

416
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:36,340
it's a bit strange doing that I just

417
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:40,120
have to export everything on my desktop

418
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:44,019
for instance and blender will generate

419
00:23:44,019 --> 00:23:47,519
for me dot W on file you can load that

420
00:23:47,519 --> 00:24:00,340
using this kind of code

421
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:03,140
and by the way I will show you also the

422
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:03,799
sandbox

423
00:24:03,799 --> 00:24:08,720
during the same time trying to load

424
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:12,080
things so the sandbox is just a place

425
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,539
for designers to just drag and drop into

426
00:24:14,539 --> 00:24:17,240
the browser the generated file just to

427
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:19,700
be sure that there I look okay they can

428
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:24,260
try and simulate all the object will

429
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:26,179
appear when it will be render up using

430
00:24:26,179 --> 00:24:32,900
the villains yes yeah that's it okay you

431
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:34,370
just drag and drop thing yeah and you

432
00:24:34,370 --> 00:24:37,159
can see that there are physic and I can

433
00:24:37,159 --> 00:24:41,840
move with my camera and if I go out of

434
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:46,720
the world oh I'm just falling down yeah

435
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:51,440
this strange to load this kind of file

436
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:53,480
is just one line of code same thing you

437
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:56,590
just have to call scene loader

438
00:24:56,590 --> 00:24:59,750
scene loader dot load and it will load

439
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:01,490
for you the file and everything will be

440
00:25:01,490 --> 00:25:03,710
accessible a new scene is created for

441
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:05,600
you a new camera a new object everything

442
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:09,919
as I shown you prefer just before but

443
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:12,320
with just one line of code because it's

444
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:16,610
coming from blender we also spent a lot

445
00:25:16,610 --> 00:25:18,200
of time working on different in fluid

446
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:20,659
input you can we handle the touch the

447
00:25:20,659 --> 00:25:23,570
pointer event staff even on Chrome and

448
00:25:23,570 --> 00:25:25,970
Firefox because we are using NDS which

449
00:25:25,970 --> 00:25:28,580
is a polyfill for pointer event we also

450
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:30,710
use a device orientation so you can move

451
00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:33,020
your tablet or whatever and just control

452
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:34,970
your camera via to al joystick with two

453
00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:37,490
fingers on touch mode like in on the

454
00:25:37,490 --> 00:25:39,169
phone for instance and a live cam

455
00:25:39,169 --> 00:25:41,450
arrives you want to have a 3d effect

456
00:25:41,450 --> 00:25:44,390
with red and green and Okaloosa with

457
00:25:44,390 --> 00:25:46,309
just one line of code you can plug a new

458
00:25:46,309 --> 00:25:48,770
clothes on Babylon's yes and have your

459
00:25:48,770 --> 00:25:51,230
head movement that can control the

460
00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:55,669
camera something I will just show you

461
00:25:55,669 --> 00:26:01,090
quickly and I will go to this one

462
00:26:01,090 --> 00:26:03,650
because we support this is the Microsoft

463
00:26:03,650 --> 00:26:08,690
moment because we support html5 and

464
00:26:08,690 --> 00:26:11,360
JavaScript has native language you can

465
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,880
just create a new project which is name

466
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:16,340
Universal app drag and drop inside

467
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:20,690
everything like double mgs the curd that

468
00:26:20,690 --> 00:26:22,610
you sorry the curd that you want to use

469
00:26:22,610 --> 00:26:24,320
yeah oh you have the code to load

470
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,060
something here but we don't see no do

471
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:28,970
not import mesh we load the scale the W

472
00:26:28,970 --> 00:26:33,080
on file which is just there and if I

473
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:37,670
execute that on my emulator right there

474
00:26:37,670 --> 00:26:44,030
it will be a new native app yeah it is

475
00:26:44,030 --> 00:26:49,550
curved it's not mine not yet and using

476
00:26:49,550 --> 00:26:51,260
touch you can I don't know if it's a

477
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:53,450
good game but you can play with the

478
00:26:53,450 --> 00:26:55,850
scale perhaps I can win some money with

479
00:26:55,850 --> 00:26:57,650
that I just have to publish that on the

480
00:26:57,650 --> 00:27:00,170
application stuff Windows Phone I can do

481
00:27:00,170 --> 00:27:02,210
the same thing we Windows 8 nothing else

482
00:27:02,210 --> 00:27:05,090
just put your JavaScript code and it

483
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:13,330
works and finally but not the last as

484
00:27:13,330 --> 00:27:17,380
you probably noticed I'm French and

485
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:21,740
Ubisoft also and we decided to work with

486
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:24,650
them to prove that a big brand

487
00:27:24,650 --> 00:27:27,950
I mean Ubisoft can create games on the

488
00:27:27,950 --> 00:27:30,710
web obviously there is a lot of problem

489
00:27:30,710 --> 00:27:33,650
we have to deal with like IP protection

490
00:27:33,650 --> 00:27:37,100
and things like that it's another part

491
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:38,210
of the problem but right now the

492
00:27:38,210 --> 00:27:41,630
feasibility the things that studio game

493
00:27:41,630 --> 00:27:43,910
studio can create a game and push it on

494
00:27:43,910 --> 00:27:46,400
the web we did that with Assassin's

495
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:48,770
Creed pirate so if you want to try it

496
00:27:48,770 --> 00:27:51,560
it's Babylon GS running with the assets

497
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:53,990
of Assassin's Creed pirate the game is

498
00:27:53,990 --> 00:27:56,110
pretty simple editor it's a race you

499
00:27:56,110 --> 00:28:01,700
have to go through all the the Waypoint

500
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:04,550
ideas you can change the weather if you

501
00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:13,610
want yeah it's better it's Florida

502
00:28:13,610 --> 00:28:19,820
I do all the race in one minute and ten

503
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:24,170
seconds just to let you know do what you

504
00:28:24,170 --> 00:28:26,900
want and for you developers we also

505
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:29,630
launched a contest and you can win Xbox

506
00:28:29,630 --> 00:28:31,490
one obviously we've Assassin's Creed

507
00:28:31,490 --> 00:28:33,980
pirate black chess edition this is the

508
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:36,530
only way to win that specific edition I

509
00:28:36,530 --> 00:28:38,660
don't know what they are inside I'm sure

510
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:40,610
there is a lot of cool stuff you just

511
00:28:40,610 --> 00:28:45,050
have to go there so let me show you if I

512
00:28:45,050 --> 00:28:51,980
can so create your own shaders /a CPF

513
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:54,740
for Assassin's Creed pirate race it's

514
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:58,460
the same shadow editor but you can play

515
00:28:58,460 --> 00:29:01,550
with the pirate ship the Assassin's

516
00:29:01,550 --> 00:29:04,100
Creed pirate ship and you can try to

517
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:05,840
create a specific shader for that ship

518
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:06,620
okay

519
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:10,220
no not yet and if your shadow is the

520
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:13,100
best one you will win the Xbox one and

521
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:19,340
the Blackshades edition okay so I go

522
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:24,270
quickly on that

523
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:26,300
everything is free everything is on

524
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:28,940
github it's not a Microsoft related

525
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:31,160
project I will like to insist on that

526
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:33,170
it's my project it's a personal project

527
00:29:33,170 --> 00:29:35,960
I spend all my night my wife rather

528
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:40,570
recognized me right now on that it's

529
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:44,150
open source you can contribute it's pure

530
00:29:44,150 --> 00:29:47,270
JavaScript no we moved to typescript two

531
00:29:47,270 --> 00:29:49,610
weeks ago it's pure tres typescript

532
00:29:49,610 --> 00:29:51,500
right now but you can contribute if you

533
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:53,360
want using javascript everything that

534
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,550
you may want to have in a CD engine

535
00:29:55,550 --> 00:29:57,290
should be there if not just let me know

536
00:29:57,290 --> 00:29:59,510
and I will at it so it's it's a

537
00:29:59,510 --> 00:30:08,550
commitment some specific and useful link
