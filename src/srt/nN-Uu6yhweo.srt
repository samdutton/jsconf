introduced from underwater

4
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:41,990

hope you'll be excited can I hear you a

16
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:31,420
little bit okay great I can't believe

17
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:34,210
we're here five years was definitely not

18
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:36,310
what I set out for when we started in

19
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:39,550
2012 with the first jazz camp and I

20
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:40,630
don't know if you know the story behind

21
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:44,200
it it was a friend of mine Sebastian and

22
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,660
I who decided to create a community

23
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:48,340
conference because we didn't know where

24
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:49,870
all these developers were in Singapore

25
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:51,430
we couldn't find them like we found

26
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:52,959
ourselves here working with web

27
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:56,350
technologies and where we were coming

28
00:02:56,350 --> 00:02:58,150
from from Europe like we knew a lot of

29
00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:00,280
people doing this but here somebody seem

30
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,050
to be creating websites they're all over

31
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:03,760
the place but we had no idea where there

32
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,670
were so we thought okay let's create a

33
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:08,230
conference and see who all these people

34
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:11,800
are and turns out 300 people actually

35
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:17,320
showed up and I wanted to show you a few

36
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:21,820
pictures that we have from then and this

37
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:24,519
is it still true as it was in 2012 we're

38
00:03:24,519 --> 00:03:26,739
still the closest JavaScript conference

39
00:03:26,739 --> 00:03:33,550
to Java still holds true so this is 2012

40
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:35,680
this is the humble beginnings how it

41
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,920
started with a few friends of mine and

42
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:41,530
we pulled up some inflatable palm trees

43
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:42,940
and thought let's do is our school

44
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:47,709
conference this is how it looked 300

45
00:03:47,709 --> 00:03:51,670
people showed up and a few things you

46
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:54,250
might actually still see at jay's convey

47
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:56,860
sure this year the Jimmy monkey flac in

48
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:58,930
the back there they're the same guys

49
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:00,519
doing the coffee for you today and it

50
00:04:00,519 --> 00:04:05,110
still is good and we had a surprising

51
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:07,450
amount of great people coming by from

52
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:09,489
all over the places judge me to join

53
00:04:09,489 --> 00:04:12,549
doesn't 2012 and Joshua Joshua are you

54
00:04:12,549 --> 00:04:15,100
here today to risk you for CSS come for

55
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:19,209
sure yesterday and he stuck around to

56
00:04:19,209 --> 00:04:21,549
can you wave there in the back if you

57
00:04:21,549 --> 00:04:23,470
have a good Wi-Fi connection today it's

58
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:25,390
because of Fred who did it the first

59
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:27,430
year and he actually build

60
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:29,289
more company around providing Wi-Fi for

61
00:04:29,289 --> 00:04:33,190
events after this and this guy maybe

62
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:34,870
he's already in the audience he is also

63
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:36,729
one of the guys who stuck around he gave

64
00:04:36,729 --> 00:04:38,470
one of the first talks the one in the

65
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:42,009
back yawn he's going to give a talk

66
00:04:42,009 --> 00:04:44,650
about Hardware this year again I think

67
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:46,210
it's his third talk at chess conf Asia

68
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:47,860
so we have a lot of people that stick

69
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:50,050
with us I think Simon is he already here

70
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:51,759
too he's going to do talk later after

71
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:53,889
lunch like he's also one of our

72
00:04:53,889 --> 00:04:55,690
favorites like I think this is going to

73
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:59,590
be his fourth talk here like yeah last

74
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:01,509
year I told him Simon I can't have you

75
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:03,610
on every year like we need other people

76
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:05,919
to and then he came and gave a lightning

77
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:09,330
talk in the break as an audience member

78
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:13,270
so the whole team 2012 which I couldn't

79
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:17,050
have done it without that's how he

80
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:20,320
started the first 300 brave souls said

81
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,509
thought yay conference in nature sounds

82
00:05:22,509 --> 00:05:26,139
great let's go that was the year

83
00:05:26,139 --> 00:05:28,509
afterwards that was in Manila was

84
00:05:28,509 --> 00:05:29,949
slightly smaller in back then I was

85
00:05:29,949 --> 00:05:31,570
still naive enough to think it would be

86
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:33,340
easy to just have a conference travel

87
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:34,960
around Southeast Asia and be organized

88
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,479
in every city every year it was really

89
00:05:37,479 --> 00:05:38,590
tough but it was a great event

90
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:46,810
afterwards 2014 slowly growing that was

91
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:54,039
last year 2015 5 years can I actually

92
00:05:54,039 --> 00:05:58,060
see who was here 2012 just a show of

93
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:00,460
hands I see young yeah that's correct i

94
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:03,789
see CJ we have a few souls that came who

95
00:06:03,789 --> 00:06:07,180
is here all five years actually I at

96
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:09,940
least saw two names coming up and I did

97
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:12,550
the Kree myself and I wonder if they are

98
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:14,259
here already and can identify themselves

99
00:06:14,259 --> 00:06:17,710
I think that's super cool that we are

100
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:19,659
able to do a conference like this year

101
00:06:19,659 --> 00:06:21,550
of the year and have so many people show

102
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:24,400
up and the main idea behind it is still

103
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,080
the same we still want to know where all

104
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,759
these web developers in Southeast Asia

105
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:31,270
and want to talk to them and make sure

106
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:34,449
that we create more people that want to

107
00:06:34,449 --> 00:06:35,760
come into web development

108
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,290
and create a welcoming community around

109
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:39,600
it and that's kind of the word that I

110
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,310
want to stick the conference around is

111
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:43,710
the community building aspect of it so

112
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:45,810
during the next two days make sure you

113
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:47,550
find as many interesting people to talk

114
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:49,680
to that you can possibly find we're

115
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,990
going to have life chest tonight where

116
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:53,940
there's going to be great performances

117
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:58,200
and together with a bunch of drinks so

118
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:00,210
you can talk and roam around and then

119
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:01,560
George our script giving your

120
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:04,350
entertainment time and we're going to

121
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:05,910
have the five-year anniversary party

122
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:07,950
tomorrow at the great escape where you

123
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:09,720
are happy to join in and pay with your

124
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:14,070
brackets for drinks and just make sure

125
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:16,290
you go home with the most learnings in

126
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:18,030
the most new contexts that you can

127
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:20,430
possibly find I also want to give out a

128
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:22,260
shout out to the good guys from Palo IT

129
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:24,390
who are participating in deaf West Asia

130
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:26,880
and they had a workshop last weekend

131
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:30,300
where I think eight to ten people that

132
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:31,890
just found themselves i signed up

133
00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:34,050
randomly i had to create a mobile app in

134
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:36,210
two days and they actually succeeded in

135
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:38,850
doing so it's online as a mobile website

136
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:42,660
on conf match com so you can try it out

137
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:44,340
it's a very simple thing is an app with

138
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:45,990
your github and you can put in your

139
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:47,790
interests and see if you find other

140
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:49,260
people that you want to connect with in

141
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:52,080
this event or other deaf fest event that

142
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,450
fest came actually about three years ago

143
00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:56,850
as a simple list of events that happened

144
00:07:56,850 --> 00:07:58,110
around the conference because people

145
00:07:58,110 --> 00:07:59,640
were with bothering me is like can you

146
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:02,130
put my event on your website for the

147
00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:03,240
conference because I want all these

148
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,680
awesome people to come to my event too

149
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,630
and eventually create ad FS as a

150
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:09,480
separate website that would list all of

151
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,070
those events and last year grew bigger

152
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:13,020
and bigger this year we have 21 events

153
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:15,480
more than 1,200 registered attendees for

154
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:18,360
all these events this is I think the

155
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:21,210
16th or 17th event as part of deaf fest

156
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:23,490
this year and FS has now an official

157
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:26,010
vision to which is to enhance digital

158
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:28,500
expertise in Asia emphasize on

159
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:31,230
collaboration and build community so

160
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:34,140
with all of this community talk let's

161
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:37,039
get some more community talk
