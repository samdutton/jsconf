00:00:13,509 --> 00:00:17,429
This is very short talk about doing donuts with SVG

2
00:00:19,539 --> 00:00:25,499
You might think it's pretty simple if you know SVG because you know you just do a circle it's not that hard

3
00:00:26,199 --> 00:00:29,129
But what I found in practice doing this is it needed math?

4
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:35,459
And even though I did university level calculus. I've forgotten every last bit of it somewhere along the way

5
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:39,750
So I had to learn how to do maths again. Just to do donuts

6
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:43,710
When you get donuts out of math and math is probably worth it

7
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:52,379
I'm just gonna change the view here so we can see but there's a little bit of CSS just for colouring

8
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:59,879
But it's not really relevant and where it goes. I mean, I'm wearing my CSS t-shirt. There's no JavaScript in this whatsoever

9
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,880
So here we've got just a

10
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:10,620
regular doughnut of the top

11
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:16,550
I've got one with a half circle and we'll get a full circle so the ideal of what we were trying to achieve here was

12
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,459
To show progress basically we do donuts

13
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:25,100
If you're doing this for the circle. It's not too hard, but when you're trying to reduce the

14
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:29,749
The length of the line it takes a bit of thought

15
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:39,409
So looking at the code here what we're actually using is you've got usual stroke, width which determines

16
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:43,219
How wide something is we've got the out of circle. Which is a stroke width of 12

17
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:46,400
It is a circle so it has a radius of 12

18
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:48,720
so

19
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,589
Radius of 12 stroke width of 12 it takes up the entire

20
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:54,260
container

21
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:57,889
The problem is if you want to actually leave a hole in the middle of it

22
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:01,700
So looking at the red circle here

23
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:08,149
It has a stroke width of 10. It's a radius of 10, so it's slightly indented. So we can see what's going on

24
00:02:09,149 --> 00:02:16,819
It has a stroke dash array now. This is something. I've not really come across before least like you can this is how you do

25
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:21,409
Like dashes in SVG so a little bit on little bit off

26
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,649
But the problem is when it applies to a circle

27
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:32,329
My first thought is maybe this would work in degrees or something like this when I looked at it. It wasn't very well documented

28
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:36,980
So I can I had to find out by trial and error

29
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:41,329
And I even found out by looking at one of my colleagues code who tried this

30
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:45,800
Came up with the solution that seemed to work, but then we found out the maths was completely wrong so

31
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:51,199
What we really need to do is actually look at how do you calculate a?

32
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:58,880
Radius or something and that's math it's 2 PI R. So if I want something in this case. I've got my

33
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:03,169
Unpop the font size a bit that's readable enough anyway

34
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,550
for my red circle my stroke - array is

35
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:09,750
62.8318 what's that?

36
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:17,629
What it is is I increase the size of that two times Math.PI?

37
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:23,240
x My radius, which is 10 and my answer here is

38
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:27,500
62.8318 and NASA made it all the way to

39
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:32,660
Outside our galaxy using 4 decimal places so you don't need any more than that

40
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:39,980
If I want to reduce this all I need to do is multiply that by what I don't want it to be

41
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:43,729
So if it only wants to be a half circle I can multiply by 0.5

42
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:46,580
So there's my result

43
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:48,650
actually

44
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:51,229
Let's put that in there 31.

45
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:57,289
4159 and now I've got a half circle

46
00:03:57,930 --> 00:03:59,519
and

47
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:05,119
Then you can go with anything so my inner circle I've got here is not actually rendering right now because there's nothing there

48
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:07,940
my stroke dash array is

49
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:09,900
0

50
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:11,900
52

51
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:15,890
Which is basically from the start to

52
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:20,719
50 point 2 6 5 5 which is 2 pi 8

53
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:25,250
Don't show anything and then start the dash again

54
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:31,519
So 2 pi 8 let's reduce it a bit we'll go

55
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:41,720
Go by point 5 so I've now got 25.13 if I modify this

56
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:51,709
25.1327 oh and I've broke it and I'd done my math wrong

57
00:04:55,410 --> 00:05:01,969
Ha ha live demo I've done something wrong all right over 25, not 23, ah
