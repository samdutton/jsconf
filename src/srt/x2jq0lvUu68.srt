00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,480

oh right well hello everybody thank you

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:05,279
guys for coming out for Cascadia hope

3
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:07,020
lunch was good and it was settled in for

4
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:09,330
this talk he said my name is tre AMA

5
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:11,759
tuna and through my journey of growth of

6
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:13,530
my life I've been everything from a

7
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:15,599
waiter to a restaurant manager a

8
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:18,600
breakdancer DJ audio engineer and for

9
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,400
the last two and a half years I've made

10
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,109
this wonderful transition into software

11
00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:24,900
engineering thankful from my hack

12
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:27,390
reactor crowd to really bring me into

13
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:30,990
this I'm also a partner to an amazing

14
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:33,059
woman and three boys at my house with a

15
00:00:33,059 --> 00:00:35,910
little girl in the way finally and I

16
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:37,770
have this mindset that I constantly

17
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:40,110
strive to be technically creative in a

18
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:43,860
creatively technical way so I'm here to

19
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:47,309
talk to you as was said about something

20
00:00:47,309 --> 00:00:49,140
that I really believe in and something

21
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:51,390
that we really do a lot of where I work

22
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:53,879
which is although right here in downtown

23
00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:56,489
Seattle we are an online marketplace for

24
00:00:56,489 --> 00:01:00,660
legal services and advice and through

25
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:03,989
this and my entire journey of life I've

26
00:01:03,989 --> 00:01:06,689
really gotten into this factor of to

27
00:01:06,689 --> 00:01:08,909
build a culture of growth is to build a

28
00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:11,640
culture of engagement and truly when you

29
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:14,250
have that it's key to individual and

30
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:17,670
company success so from the moment we're

31
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:19,680
born our minds and our bodies really

32
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,280
strive for one thing it's to grow now

33
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,590
we're gonna go through why this is

34
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:28,740
important and also go into some things

35
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:30,540
that you can start at your own company

36
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:33,600
to really foster this culture of growth

37
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,299
and engagement but at first I want you

38
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:38,970
to remember when you were young and you

39
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:40,950
really couldn't wait to grow up right

40
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:43,409
but when we're getting a little bit

41
00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:44,430
older we're like wait wait wait what the

42
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:45,899
hell were we really thinking about this

43
00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:48,869
like it's fun to be a kid I look at my

44
00:01:48,869 --> 00:01:50,790
three boys and I really want to look at

45
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:51,960
him it's like well it's really fun up

46
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:52,799
here

47
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:56,820
really it's a trap hold on but when

48
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:58,860
we're young we have those that we admire

49
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:02,909
and what we really want to do is we want

50
00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:05,700
to grow up to be like those people I

51
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,560
really want to shout out real quick on

52
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,789
all the firefighters that are down in

53
00:02:08,789 --> 00:02:10,349
California right now taking care of

54
00:02:10,349 --> 00:02:12,870
those fires and hopefully a lot more

55
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:13,260
young

56
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:17,970
grow up to be like them but throughout

57
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:20,159
this entire journey we take bits and

58
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:22,440
pieces of everything that we learn and

59
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,690
we try to put them together in this

60
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:28,379
puzzle of who we are throughout every

61
00:02:28,379 --> 00:02:30,810
single interaction that we have we take

62
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:32,819
that and blend it in with our innate

63
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:36,000
personality and they essentially become

64
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,150
part of our puzzle of life and it comes

65
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:40,470
to this concept of growth is an

66
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:43,709
iterative process we're always growing

67
00:02:43,709 --> 00:02:46,410
and we never really stop through all of

68
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:48,299
this there's one thing that influences

69
00:02:48,299 --> 00:02:50,310
us more than anything else in our lives

70
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:52,470
and it's the relationships we have with

71
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:55,410
those around us our families our friends

72
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:58,260
our teachers professors and the people

73
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:02,129
that we work with and we learned so much

74
00:03:02,129 --> 00:03:04,200
from all of these interactions that we

75
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,060
really would never be able to learn if

76
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:07,230
we're on our own

77
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:09,030
and this is the essence of a concept

78
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:11,879
called cultural learning what cultural

79
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:14,280
learning is it describes a way that a

80
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:18,060
group of people within a culture can

81
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:20,040
pass on information and skills

82
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,950
much faster than one would be able to do

83
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:25,680
individually with this though it begs

84
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,859
the question kind of what is a culture

85
00:03:27,859 --> 00:03:30,900
my personal favorite description or

86
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:33,150
definition of culture comes from the

87
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:34,980
cambers dictionary where they say

88
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:36,989
culture is the way of life especially

89
00:03:36,989 --> 00:03:39,389
the general customs and beliefs of a

90
00:03:39,389 --> 00:03:41,430
particular group of people at a

91
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:44,069
particular time I really love this one

92
00:03:44,069 --> 00:03:46,049
because it also puts in that factor of a

93
00:03:46,049 --> 00:03:48,569
particular time it kind of describes the

94
00:03:48,569 --> 00:03:49,709
fact that not only are we growing

95
00:03:49,709 --> 00:03:51,930
ourselves but the cultures that we are

96
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:54,269
part of are growing the entire time as

97
00:03:54,269 --> 00:03:55,340
well

98
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:59,400
so what culture is really formed

99
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,900
whenever any group of people get

100
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:02,730
together so we're part of many cultures

101
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:05,280
at any time in our life we have family

102
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,019
cultures business cultures cultures

103
00:04:07,019 --> 00:04:10,109
around art hobbies sports and

104
00:04:10,109 --> 00:04:13,440
entertainment facilities right in fact

105
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,120
every single person here in this

106
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,340
audience right now is part of a culture

107
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:20,699
of Cascadia j/s and I want to thank you

108
00:04:20,699 --> 00:04:22,200
right now for being a part of this

109
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,510
culture together with myself and so we

110
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:26,600
can learn and grow to get

111
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,190
last year indeed released their best

112
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:30,840
places to work list they do every year

113
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:33,450
and the number three company on that

114
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:36,060
list last year was JetBlue when

115
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:38,820
interviewed Rachel McCarthy's SVP of

116
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,740
talent described their culture as the

117
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:43,200
DNA of the company and this is really

118
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,300
true because in today's business

119
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:47,460
cultures it's more than ever important

120
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:49,800
to cultivate these concepts of culture

121
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,950
of growth and engagement because by

122
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:55,500
doing this you can pull in that factor

123
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:59,490
of engagement and of course when I'm

124
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:00,630
talking about engagement I don't mean

125
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:01,710
this kind of engagement

126
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:04,229
I mean employee engagement with their

127
00:05:04,229 --> 00:05:06,750
work right well last year a Gallup

128
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:08,190
released their state of American

129
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:09,870
workplace report where they released

130
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:12,479
that 31 percent of American employees

131
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:15,060
are actually engaged in their work 52

132
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:17,520
percent are not engaged and 17 are

133
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,180
literally disengaged from their work

134
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:23,010
this can be really alarming in some ways

135
00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:25,710
and they also talked in here about this

136
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:27,360
is costing American businesses five

137
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,370
hundred and fifty thousand are a billion

138
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:32,340
dollars a year now let's see what

139
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:34,620
happens in this same report when an

140
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:36,870
employee reports that they actually

141
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:38,550
actively learned something the previous

142
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:41,490
day they engaged and not engaged

143
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:44,520
categories nearly flip where you have

144
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:49,080
65% now engaged and only 30% not engaged

145
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:52,140
and even that actively disengaged comes

146
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:55,020
down a little bit of a step so maybe you

147
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:57,419
can look at this factor of constantly

148
00:05:57,419 --> 00:05:59,550
learning as maybe putting a ring on

149
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:00,900
those employees because of the factor

150
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:03,690
that now they're less likely to leave in

151
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:05,250
fact they might be running around saying

152
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:07,770
I am engaged and I'm happy with where I

153
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:10,080
am and ultimately this leads to one of

154
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,510
my favorite quotes which is when you do

155
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:14,520
what you love you'll never work a day in

156
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:16,860
your life but how do we build this

157
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:19,410
culture around engagement and what is it

158
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:21,750
that developers really want when they're

159
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:24,150
looking for a job well there's plenty of

160
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:26,850
surveys out there for this by show how

161
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:28,169
many people have actually filled out one

162
00:06:28,169 --> 00:06:31,680
of these seeing excellent thank you all

163
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,169
all of you because hopefully you're

164
00:06:34,169 --> 00:06:35,970
gonna help me in this next few things

165
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:38,070
right here the first one we're gonna

166
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:39,040
look at is -

167
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:41,800
eighteens stackoverflow were a hundred

168
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,230
thousand developers reported on this and

169
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:46,840
if you look at this we have compensation

170
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,150
and benefits coming up as a very top and

171
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:52,630
then number three is opportunities for

172
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:55,570
professional development number six is

173
00:06:55,570 --> 00:06:59,200
the culture but really when you think

174
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,250
about this and what we're talking about

175
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:02,020
and building a culture around learning

176
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:04,300
and development this is going to

177
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:05,830
skyrocket to the top and be the number

178
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:07,660
one thing that developers are really

179
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:10,870
looking for so let's continue looking at

180
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:13,770
this we have hacker ranks 2018 report

181
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:16,630
here professional growth in learning

182
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:20,140
took number two and then once again

183
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:21,820
company culture is down here at number

184
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:24,400
six but then when we build this this one

185
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,440
really probably skyrockets to the top

186
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:28,300
and I want to look at number four and

187
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:31,540
five here - that's smart people to learn

188
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:33,430
from and interesting problems to solve

189
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:34,870
we'll kind of revisit that again in a

190
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:37,960
minute but when you ask people that are

191
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,910
coming fresh into our industry that our

192
00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:42,430
students it actually flips over and now

193
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:44,590
we have growth and learning here at the

194
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:49,450
top and all of these kind of come up so

195
00:07:49,450 --> 00:07:50,920
now interesting problems comes up to

196
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:53,380
three smart problem company and

197
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:54,970
teammates comes up before and company

198
00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:56,950
culture comes up to five so once again

199
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:59,200
this is very important to the people

200
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,630
they're looking for jobs same thing

201
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:02,980
happens with coding game learning new

202
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:04,900
things now new things now comes up to

203
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:07,930
the top by a larger margin smart

204
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:09,730
colleagues complex problem solving and

205
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:11,860
flex and then culture comes down in here

206
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:14,500
as well so people really want to learn

207
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:17,160
things to keep them engaged in this and

208
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:21,070
so the final step of this is something

209
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:22,930
that I said on the smart people team and

210
00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:24,540
colleagues so the old saying and

211
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:26,650
surround people yourself with people who

212
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:28,810
are smarter than you it's one of the

213
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:30,760
classic sayings right and it makes sense

214
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:31,750
by everything that we said from the

215
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:34,000
beginning the biggest influences in our

216
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,560
life are the relationships with the

217
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:37,900
people around us so of course we'd want

218
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:40,060
the have the smartest people around this

219
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:41,140
in our team because then we can

220
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:43,390
hopefully become smart by proxy there

221
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:45,970
and every organization once they're the

222
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:47,830
best people on their team but which

223
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:50,020
states have the best developers they

224
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:51,250
actually did a survey on this as well

225
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:52,209
and I have to

226
00:08:52,209 --> 00:08:53,769
that here in Washington we're number one

227
00:08:53,769 --> 00:08:57,100
so yeah we've got the best developers in

228
00:08:57,100 --> 00:09:00,129
the nation but of course every company

229
00:09:00,129 --> 00:09:01,720
can't specifically have the best

230
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:05,499
developers on each team and their comes

231
00:09:05,499 --> 00:09:07,329
in this thing that companies kind of are

232
00:09:07,329 --> 00:09:09,999
a little bit scared of investing in

233
00:09:09,999 --> 00:09:12,220
junior developers and trying to really

234
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:14,110
bring them up and they want senior

235
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:15,459
developers they want the best people on

236
00:09:15,459 --> 00:09:17,170
there but I think this is one of the

237
00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:19,899
craziest reasons not to in hire junior

238
00:09:19,899 --> 00:09:22,360
developers and help invest in them every

239
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:24,220
developer has heard the words leave the

240
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:26,889
code better than when you found it well

241
00:09:26,889 --> 00:09:28,360
what about leaving the developers better

242
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:31,300
than when you hired them right

243
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:33,490
another thing happens whenever you build

244
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:36,029
this culture of learning in engagement

245
00:09:36,029 --> 00:09:38,230
that you have these systems in place so

246
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:39,819
if somebody does leave and you have to

247
00:09:39,819 --> 00:09:42,009
hire somebody on you now have a system

248
00:09:42,009 --> 00:09:44,259
in place to teach them and to bring them

249
00:09:44,259 --> 00:09:45,879
up to speed to where you need to where

250
00:09:45,879 --> 00:09:47,439
they can really contribute to your

251
00:09:47,439 --> 00:09:50,920
company as one of the only little things

252
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:53,230
that you that comes out you see the talk

253
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:55,600
of a CFO saying what happens if we train

254
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,480
them and they leave us and the smart CEO

255
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,579
really comes back and says what happens

256
00:10:00,579 --> 00:10:06,850
if we don't and they stay so there was

257
00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:08,860
another report by a company old great

258
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:09,670
place to work

259
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:11,949
they did a generations report where they

260
00:10:11,949 --> 00:10:14,499
assessed the benefits of a great

261
00:10:14,499 --> 00:10:18,100
workplace across generations where they

262
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:19,449
found the employees who experienced a

263
00:10:19,449 --> 00:10:21,490
great workplace are far more likely to

264
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:23,199
want to remain at the organization a

265
00:10:23,199 --> 00:10:25,299
long time this of course saves companies

266
00:10:25,299 --> 00:10:27,699
on recruiting and training and really

267
00:10:27,699 --> 00:10:29,379
Foster's the performance of stable teams

268
00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:31,869
an interesting thing that they found is

269
00:10:31,869 --> 00:10:35,619
that throughout the generations really

270
00:10:35,619 --> 00:10:37,199
it's really similar

271
00:10:37,199 --> 00:10:39,429
Millennials Generation X and baby

272
00:10:39,429 --> 00:10:41,079
boomers are in the 90 percentile when

273
00:10:41,079 --> 00:10:42,819
they're happy that's when the in the red

274
00:10:42,819 --> 00:10:45,189
is a happy person versus the gray is

275
00:10:45,189 --> 00:10:47,110
kind of somebody's not happy in their in

276
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:49,929
their job when we really look at this

277
00:10:49,929 --> 00:10:51,970
we're like okay wait a second also

278
00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:54,699
Millennials are now twenty five times as

279
00:10:54,699 --> 00:10:56,860
likely to stay at their job when they're

280
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:59,829
happy versus when they're not when baby

281
00:10:59,829 --> 00:11:01,600
boomers really will stay whether even

282
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,980
they're not happy and only seven times

283
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:05,079
more likely I mean who says Millennials

284
00:11:05,079 --> 00:11:05,920
are really flaky

285
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,260
flighty right this really proves that

286
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:10,029
that's not it's quite the case we just

287
00:11:10,029 --> 00:11:12,399
need to keep these people happy and they

288
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:16,389
want to stay the next one we can see how

289
00:11:16,389 --> 00:11:17,920
proud they are to tell others about

290
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,510
their job so that's another thing it

291
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:20,980
comes up when somebody is happy and

292
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:22,209
engaged with their workplace they want

293
00:11:22,209 --> 00:11:23,649
to talk to other people about that

294
00:11:23,649 --> 00:11:26,110
workplace they want to kind of display

295
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:28,180
to the world that I work in an amazing

296
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:29,620
place look at the wonderful things that

297
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:32,170
they allow me to do and learn and so

298
00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:33,490
what happens with that for the company

299
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:35,560
when you are hiring somebody else now

300
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,209
you have a plethora of people that are

301
00:11:37,209 --> 00:11:38,889
already kind of know about your culture

302
00:11:38,889 --> 00:11:40,570
and they want to be there and they're

303
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:43,570
one that come work for you finally what

304
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:45,579
this will talk about productivity there

305
00:11:45,579 --> 00:11:48,310
one last thing on here which is the fact

306
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:49,810
that when you have happy people they're

307
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:53,860
much more productive on the job so three

308
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:55,959
to four times as productive on the job

309
00:11:55,959 --> 00:11:57,579
when they are happy versus when they are

310
00:11:57,579 --> 00:12:00,850
unhappy that's money right there for any

311
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:03,190
business that has these people that

312
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:04,779
means that literally you could pretty

313
00:12:04,779 --> 00:12:06,790
much take a day off of work every single

314
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:09,730
week and be just as productive by the

315
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:12,010
four-day workweek than a five day just

316
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:15,070
by having happy people so what can we do

317
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:17,740
to build this culture of growth at all

318
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:19,089
though we have a lot of wonderful things

319
00:12:19,089 --> 00:12:21,370
that we do and I'm going to go through

320
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:23,680
these and give a little description and

321
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,600
maybe a little few tips that I have one

322
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,000
of these as well the first off is kind

323
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,890
of the easiest to do lunch and learns or

324
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:32,829
brown bag sessions so this is a simple

325
00:12:32,829 --> 00:12:35,170
factor of getting together with a group

326
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:37,269
of people over lunch people bring their

327
00:12:37,269 --> 00:12:39,370
lunch into a meeting room and one or

328
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:41,470
multiple people can talk about something

329
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:43,990
that they know and then it's really just

330
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:46,360
there to help disperse information or

331
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,980
teach something or get people kind of

332
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:50,199
enticed on on something kind of like

333
00:12:50,199 --> 00:12:52,660
these talks here the next is lightning

334
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:54,970
talks once again we see this a lot in

335
00:12:54,970 --> 00:12:57,670
conferences 5 to 15 minute long talks

336
00:12:57,670 --> 00:13:00,040
and the really nice thing here is they

337
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,899
can be done really in succession so

338
00:13:01,899 --> 00:13:03,339
maybe during a lunch and learn you can

339
00:13:03,339 --> 00:13:05,260
have four or five different people do

340
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:08,920
smaller talks there another one that I

341
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:11,470
really enjoy working with is third-party

342
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:14,860
workshops so how many people actually

343
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:16,569
heard about the graph QL workshops or

344
00:13:16,569 --> 00:13:18,100
ones are the react workshop or any other

345
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:19,180
workshops that we have

346
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:22,210
here excellent I know I saw a lot of

347
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:23,830
people at the graph QL workshop they're

348
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:25,540
here tonight as well and I thank you

349
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:28,030
guys for coming out here because that

350
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:31,920
was actually a product of my own work

351
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:35,410
using these techniques a third-party

352
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:37,570
workshop can be done in a couple ways

353
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:39,520
they can be done privately for companies

354
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:41,140
which can be quite expensive for the

355
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:43,090
companies or they can be done in a more

356
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:45,430
open way and that's how I really

357
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:46,900
presented these with it like what the

358
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:49,570
ones were like the graph QL workshop so

359
00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:53,110
I contacted even Alex who put that

360
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:55,570
workshop on and said hey my company is

361
00:13:55,570 --> 00:13:57,400
working with graph QL I would love for

362
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,680
you guys to come out and help train my

363
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:03,070
devs on this I have a room I'll pay for

364
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:05,650
lunch all I and allow you to sell

365
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:07,390
tickets outside the company as well and

366
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:09,430
bring the public into this all we ask is

367
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:11,200
for some tickets for our own devs to the

368
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,150
workshop and as compensation for that

369
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:15,310
and of course since they're actually

370
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:17,560
from Tahoe or Lake Tahoe in California

371
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:20,800
and not from this area I put out my own

372
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,900
network to get them connected with

373
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:26,140
places like Cascadia J s so that they

374
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:27,610
could sell more tickets and they could

375
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:30,640
make money for themselves so I'm really

376
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,110
passionate about these ones and it's a

377
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:33,880
very nice thing you can do and bring it

378
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:35,560
in and also be become part of the

379
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:36,840
community as well

380
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:39,790
another thing is learning stiffens so

381
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:41,380
every manager really should have a

382
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:43,890
learning budget for their developers and

383
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:47,110
we're not talking about really just like

384
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:48,880
tossing money at developers so it's like

385
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,200
hey hey hey I want to learn this I want

386
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,400
to learn that but they can really spend

387
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:54,010
these types of things on such like

388
00:14:54,010 --> 00:14:56,560
online tutorials for you my favorite

389
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:57,760
ones being things like front-end masters

390
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:01,720
or egghead IO Kent Dodds new testing

391
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:04,030
course or the wonderful West boss

392
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:07,180
courses that are out there but this is

393
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:09,310
just a way that we can help people grow

394
00:15:09,310 --> 00:15:11,470
in their own time as well now another

395
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:14,230
one is reference libraries so books I

396
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:16,510
don't know about you but I love books

397
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:19,330
I love reading them I love going the

398
00:15:19,330 --> 00:15:22,450
library picking out new books and having

399
00:15:22,450 --> 00:15:24,040
a nice reference library at work is

400
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:25,300
great because you can have all the

401
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:29,140
online resources possible but really it

402
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:31,060
that's physical nature of the book and

403
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:32,320
allowing you to really look

404
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,510
it's a different experience and you can

405
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:35,830
really find some things in there that

406
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:37,810
you won't be able to find as quickly

407
00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:40,660
online another big one is mentorship

408
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:42,820
programs so this is something that

409
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:44,500
really is kind of free but it really

410
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,900
just takes a lot of work you have to of

411
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:48,910
course find people that want to be

412
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:50,620
mentors find people that want to be

413
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:52,300
mentees figure out how to mesh these

414
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:54,610
people together but really this is a

415
00:15:54,610 --> 00:15:56,880
program that can touch people's lives

416
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,620
almost in a way that none of these other

417
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:03,040
types can mentor mentee relationships

418
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:06,040
can be lifelong relationships and by

419
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:08,080
working on a program like this at your

420
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:11,080
organization you can truly be touching

421
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,970
people's lives for the rest of their

422
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:16,090
life by this one moment and it really

423
00:16:16,090 --> 00:16:17,770
also has that same impact on not just

424
00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:21,330
the mentee but the mentors as well

425
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:23,890
another great one that we're all a part

426
00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:27,580
of right now conferences right there a

427
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:29,200
great thing we can get together we can

428
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,900
learn so I mean how many people got

429
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:33,840
their conference tickets from their jobs

430
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:36,610
having a yes that's nearly half the

431
00:16:36,610 --> 00:16:40,030
audience here it's a great thing in a

432
00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:42,040
phenomenal way for us to keep up with

433
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:45,190
our industry network and really see

434
00:16:45,190 --> 00:16:48,070
what's going on protip on this one try

435
00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:49,780
to get a group of people together to go

436
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:53,110
on to conferences I mean when you have a

437
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:55,120
group of your own organization going you

438
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,250
can really gather yourself together you

439
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:58,600
can learn from each other it becomes not

440
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,430
only an experience of the conference

441
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:03,089
itself but also a team-building event

442
00:17:03,089 --> 00:17:06,850
the next one is a really big one and can

443
00:17:06,850 --> 00:17:07,990
kind of be a little bit harder for a

444
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:10,480
cell for a lot of companies it's called

445
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:13,360
20 percent time we have this a Tavo it

446
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:17,290
started off at Google and this is really

447
00:17:17,290 --> 00:17:20,790
the concept of one day a week an

448
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:23,530
individual contributor can basically

449
00:17:23,530 --> 00:17:25,990
work on whatever they want to they can

450
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:28,570
learn something new they can build a

451
00:17:28,570 --> 00:17:29,890
little project that they've been

452
00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:31,840
thinking about as long as it kind of

453
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:34,360
relates to the work that they do and

454
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:37,300
their job in fact when Google started

455
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:39,100
enacting this they had a few things come

456
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:40,180
out of here and you may have heard of

457
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:44,740
them adsense Google Maps and the real

458
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:46,090
big elephant in the room that was the

459
00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:49,150
start of all this Gmail some of the

460
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:52,090
biggest apps in the entire world came

461
00:17:52,090 --> 00:17:56,110
out of this thought of 20% time and

462
00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:59,320
although we have a really sleek shipping

463
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:01,809
method and a way of getting testing

464
00:18:01,809 --> 00:18:05,080
environments ec2 testing environments we

465
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:06,610
have a we go to an app that we have

466
00:18:06,610 --> 00:18:09,340
simply called ship it and we make a few

467
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:10,750
clicks to the button and we have an

468
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:13,320
entire ec2 instance provisioned

469
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:16,210
terraformed and ready to go with our our

470
00:18:16,210 --> 00:18:20,020
company's entire app stack on it I hit

471
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:21,190
what branches I want there's

472
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:23,020
automatically deploy and now I have my

473
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:25,539
testing environment and then if I want

474
00:18:25,539 --> 00:18:26,890
to ship to production a couple more

475
00:18:26,890 --> 00:18:28,450
buttons my branch is shipped to

476
00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:31,270
production and it's all done as you can

477
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:32,620
guess that this came out of a 20% time

478
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:35,320
project and it saves countless hours of

479
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:38,440
our developer time on shipping so these

480
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:41,140
are really a way that companies may not

481
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:42,940
look at that factor of like what are we

482
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:45,520
really getting back to this but you can

483
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:46,870
come up some really cool things when you

484
00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:49,120
just let your developers flourish have

485
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,950
fun and work on things that they want to

486
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:53,830
the last one I'll talk about is deep

487
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:56,380
dive days so this is a fun one that I'm

488
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:58,950
working on right now and essentially

489
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:01,960
these are full days that a group of

490
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:05,260
people will take their 20% time go into

491
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:07,539
a room together and learn something and

492
00:19:07,539 --> 00:19:10,059
dig into it a lot more than they really

493
00:19:10,059 --> 00:19:12,370
could on say a Lunch and Learn or a

494
00:19:12,370 --> 00:19:14,140
little bit individually and as I said

495
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:15,970
this is kind of a group thing which also

496
00:19:15,970 --> 00:19:17,890
allows you to interact with each other

497
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:20,799
work together ask questions and they can

498
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:23,919
be led by a person on the team or you

499
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:25,299
can do things like go through online

500
00:19:25,299 --> 00:19:28,210
courses things like egghead or front-end

501
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:30,190
masters which really have these longer

502
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:32,980
courses that individuals can go through

503
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:34,390
but when you go through them as a group

504
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:37,450
you get that multiplying effect of that

505
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:42,159
cultural learning once again and so I

506
00:19:42,159 --> 00:19:44,380
really also want to stress on the factor

507
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:45,820
that remember you're not just a consumer

508
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:48,279
of the information whenever you're doing

509
00:19:48,279 --> 00:19:49,990
these things it's really also in your

510
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:52,860
best interest to be an instructor as

511
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:55,690
Aristotle told the world teaching is the

512
00:19:55,690 --> 00:19:58,040
highest form of understanding

513
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:02,360
and it really is it helps you cement the

514
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:03,680
thoughts and the learnings that you've

515
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:04,220
had

516
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:06,260
I don't know how many people recognize

517
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:08,240
this guy kind of big in our environment

518
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:12,470
here Kent C Dodds very big in our

519
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:14,120
wonderful world of JavaScript and he has

520
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:18,560
a concept he talks to that is consumed

521
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:21,710
build teach this is the way that he

522
00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:26,150
personally uses or learns new concepts

523
00:20:26,150 --> 00:20:28,280
and news technology he goes out he

524
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:31,070
learns them he consumes information he

525
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:33,530
builds products with those and then he

526
00:20:33,530 --> 00:20:37,070
teaches them to the world in his talk

527
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:39,530
zero the 60 in software development how

528
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:41,960
to jumpstart your career he brings in

529
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:44,090
the quote from Ashley Williams the

530
00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:47,000
absolutely love teacher is nature's way

531
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,800
of letting you know how sloppy your

532
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:52,130
understanding is when you teach concepts

533
00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:54,080
to people you're gonna get those

534
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,270
questions and truly you're gonna go wait

535
00:20:56,270 --> 00:21:00,620
wait I'm not sure and that's something

536
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:02,930
that is that concept of a you don't know

537
00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:06,080
what you don't know in many ways so when

538
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,000
you teach other people and you take that

539
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,210
time to help instruct others then you're

540
00:21:11,210 --> 00:21:13,670
really also finding the holes in your

541
00:21:13,670 --> 00:21:16,130
own understanding and can go afterwards

542
00:21:16,130 --> 00:21:20,030
and start filling those holes in so

543
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:23,000
remember through this that the key to

544
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,620
success is to build a culture of growth

545
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:27,860
which in extension builds a culture of

546
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:31,250
engagement so invest in yourself and

547
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:32,840
your colleagues and leave everyone

548
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:35,600
around you better than when you found

549
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:39,950
them I want to leave you with a final

550
00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:42,950
quote from actually the former CTO of

551
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:46,520
