00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:08,760

hello so first of all I'm really happy

2
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:11,570
that so many people are interested in a

3
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:14,549
clean architecture or coding clean

4
00:00:14,549 --> 00:00:17,400
components in the front-end code quality

5
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,619
or clean code is something that I really

6
00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:22,130
am passionate about and I think that

7
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:25,109
learning some tricks can actually help

8
00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:28,260
you to significantly improve your code

9
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:31,500
and make it a lot more testable and yeah

10
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:35,070
I kind of repurposed my initial idea of

11
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:38,700
using snake to convey some of these

12
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:41,760
ideas because I was inspired by a talk

13
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,739
yesterday about clean architecture

14
00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:46,770
looking at it a bit from a higher level

15
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:50,579
and I just felt that that was exactly

16
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:55,800
what I wanted to share too so first of

17
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:58,710
all a bit about me my name is Peter and

18
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:01,289
I'm a developer at small improvements in

19
00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:05,909
Berlin I'm a big fan of many things but

20
00:01:05,909 --> 00:01:07,770
among these things are functional

21
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:10,530
programming clean code keeping things

22
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:12,920
simple regardless of what it is and

23
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:15,780
perhaps a bit random air quality I'm

24
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:19,259
quite obsessed about measuring particles

25
00:01:19,259 --> 00:01:28,640
and stuff odd things about me okay and

26
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,220
yeah so even if a snake is not like main

27
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:35,729
thing now but I still have a lot of

28
00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:38,880
snake stuff and it might be helpful for

29
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:43,909
you to see an example of how it looks

30
00:01:43,909 --> 00:01:47,390
just so that the code examples are a bit

31
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:52,090
clearer

32
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:56,610
so let me embarrass myself by losing a

33
00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:01,439
snake quickly so this is the a game that

34
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:07,710
I built and we will use that as an

35
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:10,849
example but I will also go beyond just

36
00:02:10,849 --> 00:02:13,310
snake and show you some example

37
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:15,110
that are perhaps more in line with what

38
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:19,670
you might I died that are a bit more in

39
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:25,250
line with what you might be be coding on

40
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:28,819
a day-to-day basis but I think snake is

41
00:02:28,819 --> 00:02:32,390
a great example because it's yeah you

42
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:33,980
couldn't see it has a component with

43
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:39,560
quite a lot of interaction so a quick

44
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:43,630
outline first we'll look a bit at

45
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:47,090
presentation versus model or present or

46
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:50,150
view versus logic whatever you call it

47
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:53,600
but I'm trying to distinguish between

48
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,450
these two different things and then dive

49
00:02:56,450 --> 00:03:00,290
a bit deeper into what a model is how it

50
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:04,819
can look like and then proceed with

51
00:03:04,819 --> 00:03:09,310
views because they are pretty useful and

52
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:13,100
some testing on top of that and finally

53
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:16,700
I will summarize learnings so what you

54
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:21,620
can take with you so let's start with

55
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:26,450
kind of a quiz or just yeah engaging you

56
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:30,829
as the audience so if you look at the

57
00:03:30,829 --> 00:03:33,049
first one a checkout flow what would you

58
00:03:33,049 --> 00:03:34,640
categorize that as is that a

59
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,040
presentation thing or is it like more

60
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:46,150
model logic any opinions ideas sorry

61
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:51,799
yeah it's good I will also share my

62
00:03:51,799 --> 00:03:55,630
opinions after

63
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:59,180
and generating components what would you

64
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:09,440
treat at us very good and the setting

65
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:14,800
game over if you hit the wall very nice

66
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:19,609
and yeah the first one a bit tricky in

67
00:04:19,609 --> 00:04:22,670
my opinion fingers both and you have to

68
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:25,030
remember here that we are looking at

69
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:27,950
focusing on the front end a bit so what

70
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:30,020
what our model is in the front end can

71
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:31,490
be a bit different from what you would

72
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:35,870
see it as in the back end for example I

73
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:39,650
think some frameworks call it also view

74
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:43,130
model for example which is kind of

75
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:45,590
speaking to that but yeah I would say

76
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:48,470
check out flow as it needs both both

77
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:51,590
sides generating components presentation

78
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:54,680
ideally of a model and setting game over

79
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:57,590
if you hit the wall and this is in snake

80
00:04:57,590 --> 00:05:01,669
then I would treat as a model concern so

81
00:05:01,669 --> 00:05:06,950
what can a model look like here's an

82
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:13,070
example of check out model I made up so

83
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:16,100
you have a step because this is a

84
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:20,060
stepwise stepwise process and the first

85
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:22,970
step could for example be entering your

86
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:25,610
contact details which consists of a

87
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:29,300
bunch of fields and then perhaps yeah

88
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:31,370
perhaps based on the country you select

89
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:34,400
you offer different payment methods or

90
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,640
something so you need this for multiple

91
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,979
purposes both to influence how you

92
00:05:39,979 --> 00:05:43,490
render the view later on and to have

93
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:47,210
this logic in the system so in Iceland

94
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:49,490
you can pay with cookies but in Sweden

95
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:53,530
maybe pay with blueberries or something

96
00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:58,760
another model would be snake my favorite

97
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:02,960
model so in snake it's yeah you saw me

98
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:06,080
playing it before and I was listing or

99
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,260
showing the status

100
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:09,660
if it's game over or the game is running

101
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:13,070
the score and then you have a bunch of

102
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:15,920
details that you need to keep track of

103
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:19,230
to be able to like ya decide what

104
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:20,490
happens next

105
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:24,330
can I press up what happens when the

106
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:26,640
time goes on will I move up if I eat an

107
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,680
apple what happens then and where are

108
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:33,390
actually the apples so let's do an

109
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:36,120
experiment because we didn't introduce

110
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,370
views yet

111
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:41,930
really so how would it look if you would

112
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:55,709
just play with a model

113
00:06:55,719 --> 00:06:59,379
and we will go into this disc out a bit

114
00:06:59,379 --> 00:07:01,959
later so don't have to care too much

115
00:07:01,959 --> 00:07:06,489
about it so in a very easy way to play

116
00:07:06,489 --> 00:07:07,959
with our model is to just use

117
00:07:07,959 --> 00:07:20,070
console.log

118
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:24,220
and it's it becomes a bit trickier think

119
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:28,180
yeah already game over now that

120
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:29,710
challenge is kind of not eating the

121
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:35,530
apples but staying alive yeah so that's

122
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:37,449
how it look and it shows that the model

123
00:07:37,449 --> 00:07:39,699
is kind of enough in a sense it's what

124
00:07:39,699 --> 00:07:42,310
you need to be running whatever you do

125
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:44,500
and the check out example exam for

126
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:47,139
example you could also technically work

127
00:07:47,139 --> 00:07:49,389
with the model you see the step and you

128
00:07:49,389 --> 00:07:52,150
you're on your own say that I so now I

129
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:56,590
need to fill in the contact details but

130
00:07:56,590 --> 00:07:59,169
it's really boring to play with this

131
00:07:59,169 --> 00:08:04,840
model directly so we need views and what

132
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:07,120
is a view yeah you can see it is

133
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,710
something that you just connect to your

134
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:11,889
model kind of a mapping of your model

135
00:08:11,889 --> 00:08:14,919
into something else so you take the

136
00:08:14,919 --> 00:08:17,949
model transform it for example you

137
00:08:17,949 --> 00:08:20,319
already seen how I did it into the

138
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:23,259
browser using under the hood react

139
00:08:23,259 --> 00:08:27,159
components you also seen one of Darwin

140
00:08:27,159 --> 00:08:30,219
here console.log that I used it's in a

141
00:08:30,219 --> 00:08:33,339
sense of view and then I could also

142
00:08:33,339 --> 00:08:36,849
implement a terminal view which I

143
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:40,870
actually did but what is a view at a bit

144
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:47,620
of a higher level so in essence if we

145
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:51,070
look at the snake example you present

146
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:54,459
the model and then yeah I'm kind of

147
00:08:54,459 --> 00:08:57,880
combining also what you would if you

148
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:00,730
know MVC for example you typically treat

149
00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:04,149
this as the controller bit but in react

150
00:09:04,149 --> 00:09:07,660
world it's very common to group these

151
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:10,060
together in the component which I also

152
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:16,680
do but so a view in react world is about

153
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:20,949
present presenting what you have so we

154
00:09:20,949 --> 00:09:23,140
need to draw the status in some way so

155
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:25,990
this is the conceptual idea and we draw

156
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:27,880
the apples we draw the snake we draw the

157
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:30,819
walls and we repeat and we need to move

158
00:09:30,819 --> 00:09:32,640
the game forward by

159
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,260
the stick which moves it moves it

160
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:36,450
forward in time and then we have a bunch

161
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:39,089
of things that allow us to manipulate

162
00:09:39,089 --> 00:09:42,870
this view and as I said the snake is

163
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:45,329
just an example because it's fun to work

164
00:09:45,329 --> 00:09:47,820
with but actually this is how I think

165
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:50,700
you should be coding in your normal

166
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:54,329
day-to-day coding for example with the

167
00:09:54,329 --> 00:09:56,490
checkout flow you could have something

168
00:09:56,490 --> 00:09:58,370
like this

169
00:09:58,370 --> 00:10:01,800
so we render the contact details which

170
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:04,500
is some kind of form and this form has

171
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,690
some handlers that allow you to

172
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:09,810
manipulate the model so this set name

173
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:13,140
will give in a model and a new name

174
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:15,360
give you back your new model which has

175
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,700
this name set and then you rerender it

176
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:21,329
so it's yeah it's not limited to snake

177
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:23,820
but you can apply it for anything

178
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:27,180
basically in the front end and let's

179
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:30,240
have a quick look at how this actually

180
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:49,580
looks in real code that's also

181
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:54,090
so can can everyone see the coat is it

182
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:56,940
large enough cool

183
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:59,490
so this conceptual yeah there is some

184
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:01,950
boilerplate here because this model is

185
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:04,980
running in the terminal but you can see

186
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:08,279
these drawn methods here draw snake draw

187
00:11:08,279 --> 00:11:11,250
apples and then yeah a bit

188
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:13,520
boilerplate getting the initialize

189
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:17,040
initialization but here is the loop that

190
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,589
you saw in this conceptual idea where we

191
00:11:19,589 --> 00:11:23,760
draw the different parts and manipulate

192
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:27,350
in the model and one observation is that

193
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:31,200
it's pretty simple in there are not many

194
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,160
like if statement conditionals and stuff

195
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:48,060
and let's also have a look at react one

196
00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:51,390
cool yeah and by the way I'm using some

197
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:56,200
typescript but to such an extent so it

198
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,240
you don't really need to know it or care

199
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:03,010
about it so it looks a bit different

200
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:05,320
because I'm using react here and have to

201
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:08,530
adapt to react but the principle is

202
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:12,150
still the same so up here I have these

203
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:15,400
mappings that allow me to control the

204
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:18,760
model and yeah need to do it a bit

205
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:20,320
differently because I don't want to

206
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,450
rerender all the time

207
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:27,250
and here is the game loop and because in

208
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:31,060
react you given the state update you

209
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:34,450
render the state so so I don't do draw

210
00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:37,060
walls and stuff here but I rather do

211
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:40,780
that here that you might recognize and

212
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:44,230
again something to observe is that this

213
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:48,190
is pretty simple code there's not much

214
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:51,760
that tells you about the game for

215
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:55,270
example you can't really say even what

216
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:58,890
happens if I eat an apple all of this is

217
00:12:58,890 --> 00:13:01,930
not not existing here but everything is

218
00:13:01,930 --> 00:13:06,040
just about putting the pixels on the in

219
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:10,750
the browser basically so let's jump back

220
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:19,650
to presentation yeah

221
00:13:19,650 --> 00:13:33,480
testing so actually I wonder if I

222
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:35,380
yeah I've been running for it pretty

223
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:36,910
quick but testing is there an

224
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:39,160
interesting topic so let's try to spend

225
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:45,820
some time there so test one problem that

226
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:55,300
I often see and if you look at what

227
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:56,980
actually we will see it when we look at

228
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:59,560
the test so a problem with tests that I

229
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:01,089
often sees that they are very very

230
00:14:01,089 --> 00:14:03,459
detailed it's like for example in a

231
00:14:03,459 --> 00:14:06,070
snake game a test could be a set

232
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:08,320
movement vector should set the movement

233
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:11,740
vector and you assert on that and I mean

234
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:13,630
that's an extreme example but you will

235
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:16,570
see often a huge amount of tests that

236
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:20,589
are at a very detailed level and I want

237
00:14:20,589 --> 00:14:22,480
to show you how I think tests should

238
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:25,810
look like and how these principles when

239
00:14:25,810 --> 00:14:27,430
you put them all together makes it

240
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:41,930
really easy to accomplish that

241
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:44,190
so these are my tests for the snake

242
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:49,380
model yeah first start with a bunch of

243
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:54,600
simple tests that that you would

244
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:58,680
probably normally see also but then I

245
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,990
test confirmed that very important

246
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:03,330
properties of the snake model works for

247
00:15:03,330 --> 00:15:06,960
example different seats so this is

248
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:09,660
another point that allowed me to do

249
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:13,800
testing well that yeah I don't rely my

250
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:16,170
model is pure as well maybe that's

251
00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:21,060
something worth mentioning that the

252
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:23,700
model execution of the model will always

253
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:26,430
give the same result and one key aspect

254
00:15:26,430 --> 00:15:31,710
of that is that it's pure so I'm using a

255
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:33,870
seat that initializes our random

256
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:36,560
generator that allows me to still get

257
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:39,690
randomness in it while keeping it pure I

258
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:42,960
can show you that soon but here I just

259
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,430
confirm the property but the more

260
00:15:44,430 --> 00:15:48,030
interesting tests are here where I'm

261
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:54,660
pretty much playing the game so going

262
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:57,650
into the top wall leads to game over and

263
00:15:57,650 --> 00:16:01,800
check the order walls as well eating an

264
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:04,830
apple increases the score by 1 and what

265
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:05,340
do I do

266
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:09,080
well I just create a game instance and

267
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:12,840
play until I eat an apple and thanks to

268
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:16,410
using this seat for the random

269
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:19,830
generation I know that the apple will

270
00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:22,170
always be at the same place even if a

271
00:16:22,170 --> 00:16:24,960
user would perceive it as random of

272
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,820
course when you play the game I just use

273
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:29,340
a random seed every time that makes sure

274
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:32,160
that you can't memorize where the apples

275
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:36,750
are and stuff like that yeah but I

276
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:38,550
managed to test like pretty much the

277
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:43,710
whole game here snake is growing snake

278
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:46,050
crushing into itself leads to game over

279
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:50,370
and all of this is done with tests that

280
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:53,520
basically could be as the usage of the

281
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:57,110
code

282
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:00,910
and yeah what enables this simple

283
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:05,320
testing yeah a pure model the random

284
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:07,690
generation something very importance is

285
00:17:07,690 --> 00:17:14,709
simple construction of the object let me

286
00:17:14,709 --> 00:17:19,570
show you so to create a snake game and

287
00:17:19,570 --> 00:17:21,490
this is actually something you typically

288
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:23,830
don't fully can control because

289
00:17:23,830 --> 00:17:25,420
sometimes you just need a lot of data

290
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:30,940
but based on my experience yeah

291
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:32,740
from whenever I started being

292
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:35,560
professional software developer one of

293
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:40,090
the biggest obstacles are that it's hard

294
00:17:40,090 --> 00:17:43,630
to test and it makes people skip it so

295
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:48,250
is a construction rich model with very

296
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:51,030
meaningful modifiers so I'm a big fan of

297
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:54,700
DDD domain-driven design and this is

298
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:58,420
something I brought with me from that so

299
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:01,150
rather than having a set movement vector

300
00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:04,450
method on my model that I looked at a

301
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:06,730
lot of snake implementations and most of

302
00:18:06,730 --> 00:18:10,450
them were dealing with updating the dxdy

303
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:14,710
to to make things yeah to change the

304
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:17,050
movement but I just call it move up and

305
00:18:17,050 --> 00:18:22,090
that's what I use in my tests so I try

306
00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:25,510
to make the model very deep in a sense

307
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:28,330
so there is of course a lot involved in

308
00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:30,100
moving up I have to check if it's

309
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:34,300
possible and stuff like that but the

310
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:44,630
model on the exposes simple move up

311
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,910
yeah or we have to move down example

312
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:53,580
here and complete separation of model

313
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:55,740
and view I think that's the most

314
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:58,370
essential things and it boils down to

315
00:18:58,370 --> 00:19:01,260
separation of concerns what we discussed

316
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:04,530
in the beginning with what is what is

317
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:07,140
presentation what is model this is

318
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:10,440
really the key to to code cleaner

319
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:13,740
components because as you've seen

320
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:16,470
examples the view layers just be are

321
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:18,960
trivial basically and all the logic

322
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:22,260
lives in the model and the model itself

323
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:24,900
is also trivial or at least you can make

324
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:27,540
it it's a bit of a different small scale

325
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:30,750
challenge how you code it but as long as

326
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:34,140
the interface from it is nice then you

327
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:36,000
have something really nice to work with

328
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,220
that will kind of translate into a

329
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:42,929
simple view simple react components yeah

330
00:19:42,929 --> 00:19:45,210
nothing it's important that in your

331
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:47,280
day-to-day work you need to remove

332
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,870
obstacles you need to make it really

333
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:52,770
simple to make people test more because

334
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:56,010
this is I often heard these arguments

335
00:19:56,010 --> 00:19:57,929
like is testing really worth it it's

336
00:19:57,929 --> 00:20:01,890
such a big maintenance burdens it just

337
00:20:01,890 --> 00:20:07,049
takes a lot of time but I think if you

338
00:20:07,049 --> 00:20:10,230
showed tests where an application where

339
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:12,299
all tests looks kind of like this then

340
00:20:12,299 --> 00:20:16,679
this would partly disappear and this is

341
00:20:16,679 --> 00:20:20,460
what happened at my work for example we

342
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:24,030
we started to write way simpler tests

343
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:28,020
and it makes a lot of people write more

344
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:31,140
tests that I you can just see that that

345
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:33,000
when you extract out the logic from the

346
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,760
components then it's so easy so there is

347
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:38,190
no excuse and the tests are really

348
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:40,830
meaningful as well so you you kind of

349
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:42,809
can motivate for yourself why they are

350
00:20:42,809 --> 00:20:49,200
valuable so what are the biggest

351
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:53,370
learnings well I would say that I have a

352
00:20:53,370 --> 00:20:56,760
lot of learnings in one way but there

353
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:57,760
are only two things

354
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:01,840
that are really important to like if you

355
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,820
would start to do this I think you would

356
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:07,660
produce better code that's my belief

357
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:10,180
that if you kick up kick out the model

358
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:12,670
from your component to really be strict

359
00:21:12,670 --> 00:21:15,300
about separating it go back to the old

360
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:19,360
MVC wrote I'm sure you done it at some

361
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:26,620
point then yeah separate it out and for

362
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:29,140
example at work I am really happy every

363
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:32,380
time I see a folder which has the

364
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:35,410
component we often put it in indexed ojs

365
00:21:35,410 --> 00:21:38,260
and next to it sits a model jeaious and

366
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:41,590
this is a really small model that or

367
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:43,690
well the size doesn't matter but it's a

368
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:46,000
model where all the logic has been

369
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,940
extracted which ensures that the

370
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:52,420
component itself is super pure super

371
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:55,780
nice super easy to read and the model is

372
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:58,390
trivial to test super quick to tests and

373
00:21:58,390 --> 00:22:02,070
as I showed you the tests are not really

374
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:05,320
limited to a set movement vector or

375
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:06,610
stuff like that but you can actually

376
00:22:06,610 --> 00:22:10,630
test the whole logic such as playing a

377
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:12,970
game of snake or whatever you are doing

378
00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:21,250
our checkout flow yeah I think we can go

379
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:31,510
to if there are any questions everything

380
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:41,210
crystal yeah you in the back

381
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:44,800
that's correct and that was an example

382
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:50,260
of like kind of one of the points of you

383
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:52,150
normally you don't care about that you

384
00:22:52,150 --> 00:22:53,650
don't need to run your model in

385
00:22:53,650 --> 00:22:55,780
different places but this is a free

386
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:58,510
benefit you get and it's a clear example

387
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:01,660
of how separation of concerns help you

388
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:13,180
so if we look at my snake model so so

389
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:15,370
the snake model it really doesn't know

390
00:23:15,370 --> 00:23:17,380
anything about where it's running we are

391
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:23,980
creating the model that I showed and I'm

392
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:26,680
using some interesting concepts but not

393
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:30,280
so important but then we have these move

394
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:36,640
up move down and let's look at exported

395
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:40,890
things and at each method get the score

396
00:23:40,890 --> 00:23:43,420
so it doesn't matter where it runs and

397
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:44,590
that's why I could run it in the

398
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:49,210
terminal and browser actually I might

399
00:23:49,210 --> 00:24:03,440
also so in the terminal I also did

400
00:24:03,450 --> 00:24:10,740
I did build an interface so you can

401
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:13,280
actually play it as a real snake as well

402
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:18,810
and like abuse you can have as many

403
00:24:18,810 --> 00:24:21,060
views as you want by separating the

404
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:25,700
model out like this any other questions

405
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:28,890
or do you want to see details of any

406
00:24:28,890 --> 00:24:39,220
specific part

407
00:24:39,230 --> 00:24:42,850
okay so maybe a final question from me

408
00:24:42,850 --> 00:24:46,480
did you learn anything do you feel that

409
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:50,419
will you separate out your models a tiny

410
00:24:50,419 --> 00:24:56,150
bit more after my talk at least I see

411
00:24:56,150 --> 00:24:59,000
nodding heads very nice

412
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:03,890
it's truly it it truly has a very big

413
00:25:03,890 --> 00:25:07,640
impact on your code and for me these the

414
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,830
principles from clean architecture that

415
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:13,280
I read the book and I often apply it in

416
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:16,460
the back end and I also read Dedede book

417
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:19,240
which I really love there which

418
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:23,120
emphasizes separating out the business

419
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:25,190
logic which in this case would be the

420
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:29,299
snake model and this this theory can

421
00:25:29,299 --> 00:25:33,230
really help you to produce the cleaner

422
00:25:33,230 --> 00:25:35,600
code that is just easier to maintain

423
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:42,679
more fun to work with yeah so if there

424
00:25:42,679 --> 00:25:45,620
are no questions or anything you want to

425
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:48,980
see yeah this is what you would have

426
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:53,350
seen in my FB talk but maybe next time

427
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:58,669
but very nice in my opinion okay that's

428
00:25:58,669 --> 00:26:03,130
it then thank you very much and please

429
00:26:03,130 --> 00:26:05,780
