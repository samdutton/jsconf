00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:00,949

[Applause]

2
00:00:00,949 --> 00:00:05,370
Hey hello so I hope you're doing fine

3
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:08,040
my name is Velasco Raquel I work for a

4
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:09,389
company called Blackrock

5
00:00:09,389 --> 00:00:11,790
and yeah it's a financial company but

6
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:14,429
also a software company because we are

7
00:00:14,429 --> 00:00:16,440
selling our platform asset management

8
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:18,900
platform Aladin to other companies as

9
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:22,170
well so we have a nice office in

10
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:24,359
Budapest in a building called the white

11
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:26,789
house so you might say that I'm a

12
00:00:26,789 --> 00:00:28,830
vice-president from the White House not

13
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:31,199
the president though and it's a not a

14
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:38,219
good joke nowadays so the bridge between

15
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:40,920
people and the underlying software

16
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:43,230
systems that the V developers build is

17
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:49,680
the user interface and it could be it

18
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,719
can can come in different variations

19
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:53,940
just think about the smart speakers that

20
00:00:53,940 --> 00:01:01,859
are pretty popular today and most of the

21
00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:04,110
applications have a visual interface now

22
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:06,659
you need really need to pay attention to

23
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:10,530
this visual interface because if you

24
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:14,490
break this link then it will make your

25
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:20,260
users lose trust in your business so

26
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:24,119
later in in the hands-on part of the

27
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:26,479
talk I'm going to show you how you can

28
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:31,740
use the tool called storybook to render

29
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:33,689
your components in isolation in your

30
00:01:33,689 --> 00:01:36,990
angular project so I'm going to use

31
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:39,869
angular for this example and then I'm

32
00:01:39,869 --> 00:01:42,570
going to show you how you can use a the

33
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:46,590
add-on called story shots to create

34
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:49,229
snapshots and then later how you can

35
00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:51,030
automate this whole process to compare

36
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:53,460
the old snapshots with the new snapshots

37
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:56,250
as you're changing your code and running

38
00:01:56,250 --> 00:02:01,689
the test again okay

39
00:02:01,689 --> 00:02:05,329
so hands up if you have used this

40
00:02:05,329 --> 00:02:09,160
software okay

41
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:11,810
okay I thought it would be a bit less

42
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:14,930
but but yeah so I think this is a really

43
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:17,180
great example of a well sold out user

44
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:20,110
interface it really made life easier

45
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:22,940
compared to copying files on the

46
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:25,549
personal computers in the 90s in fact

47
00:02:25,549 --> 00:02:28,849
everybody pretty much had this had

48
00:02:28,849 --> 00:02:31,790
norton commander on their PC it was the

49
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:34,790
first thing you installed or just copied

50
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:39,170
right and for those who don't know it

51
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:43,670
it's it has two panels side by side now

52
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:46,760
on this image I just only have one panel

53
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,500
open and the other is just showing the

54
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,269
information about this but could be two

55
00:02:50,269 --> 00:02:52,910
panels with different locations on your

56
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:54,500
file system and you can easily copy

57
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:58,000
files from one panel to the other now

58
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,700
people don't believe this anymore do you

59
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:05,150
think why do you know why so I think the

60
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:07,670
reason is because people don't use

61
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:12,049
computers anymore you know what is the

62
00:03:12,049 --> 00:03:14,930
personal computer anyway so instead what

63
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:20,000
they do is they watch movies they browse

64
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,579
the Internet they message each other and

65
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:28,730
if you're talking about design in the

66
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:30,590
software industry you pretty much have

67
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:33,680
to talk about Steve Jobs and his team at

68
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,470
Apple right because Apple had this

69
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:39,650
vision that computers will one day be

70
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:43,190
just a part of our everyday life as just

71
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:46,910
just tools and pretty much hiding the

72
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:51,349
underlining technology and it turned out

73
00:03:51,349 --> 00:03:59,090
to be true and I think this is this

74
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:01,639
image really kind of represents apples

75
00:04:01,639 --> 00:04:04,160
philosophy and although I have an iPad

76
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:07,669
here it was really around 2007 with the

77
00:04:07,669 --> 00:04:10,370
introduction of the iPhone and then all

78
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:13,609
the other smartphones when things really

79
00:04:13,609 --> 00:04:15,110
changed because this

80
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:18,739
new form factor required people to be

81
00:04:18,739 --> 00:04:22,430
more creative and figure out new ways to

82
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:26,330
to do wijl interfaces and you know use

83
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:35,930
gestures and so on so now let's look at

84
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:42,050
some also I want to mention that a lot

85
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:44,600
of these changes that people figured out

86
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:47,240
on the smart phones were transferred

87
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,950
back to the desktop so let's see a

88
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:53,380
couple of examples of what changed okay

89
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:58,720
so this is a form that was previously a

90
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,460
registration form maybe it's pretty

91
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:04,370
static yeah you have some input fields

92
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:07,730
there but you get the error message once

93
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:09,380
you submitted the form and it was

94
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:11,390
rendered on the server side and sent

95
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:16,250
back with a new page yeah it's pretty

96
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:19,970
boring so now we have more sophisticated

97
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:22,910
form controls right they have different

98
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:26,270
states they have different ways to input

99
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:32,180
data as you type they show you whether

100
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:34,090
you have an error in the field or not

101
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:39,620
and yeah we can hopefully see in a

102
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:43,100
moment it you know it turns if you enter

103
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:46,760
a valid email and we have form controls

104
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:50,840
that even present you with a pop-up so

105
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,100
in one word they are more sophisticated

106
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:57,229
and of course it's more complex to

107
00:05:57,229 --> 00:06:00,650
implement so luckily we have designed

108
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:03,140
systems widely available for example

109
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:05,930
Google's material design but also maybe

110
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:12,229
bootstrap however and you as a front-end

111
00:06:12,229 --> 00:06:15,830
developer quino's can always just use

112
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:19,850
this but companies today are realizing

113
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:22,820
more and more that they actually have to

114
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:25,190
have their own branding their own design

115
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:29,150
system and inherently that means more

116
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:33,530
right because one design system wears

117
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:35,300
this many design systems you know it

118
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:44,060
cannot possibly be as good so let's now

119
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:49,200
take a look at one more example

120
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:51,410
previously this could have been a

121
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:53,960
banking application and a screen where

122
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:58,070
you transfer money from you know from

123
00:06:58,070 --> 00:06:59,630
the image you can tell that it's packed

124
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:02,660
with features and you know what happens

125
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:07,540
if if the interface is slightly off well

126
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:10,310
you don't even notice it right you you

127
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:13,120
don't really dub that it will work now

128
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:17,660
today a startup company might offer you

129
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:19,580
an application in your smartphone so

130
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:22,940
this and they are using their own design

131
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:25,070
system right not using any native

132
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:26,450
components because they want to

133
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:30,260
distinguish themselves and so they come

134
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:31,910
up with a nice-looking application and

135
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:34,010
then they promise that it's gonna be the

136
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:35,930
easiest ever experience and the most

137
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:39,230
convenient and you start using it but

138
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:41,840
what happens if the developers screw up

139
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:45,230
and the user interface is slightly off

140
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:49,400
well in this case you quickly you lose

141
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,920
trust in the whole application and the

142
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:54,680
company because you know I mean it

143
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,360
should look professional but this

144
00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:02,600
doesn't look professional and there are

145
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,220
some other things as well

146
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:06,740
that today make life harder for the

147
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:10,520
front-end developers so of course you

148
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:13,340
need to support multiple devices of

149
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:14,840
course you need to support multiple

150
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:19,250
locales and slow connections and you

151
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:21,680
need to think about accessibility so

152
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,230
user interfaces are more complex and

153
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:27,350
it's easier than ever to break them so

154
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:28,780
what do we do about that

155
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:33,380
well for one we are we do we create our

156
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:36,460
architecture in a way that supports

157
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:39,200
testing supports unit testing so as you

158
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,769
can see here there is a unit direct

159
00:08:42,769 --> 00:08:44,420
shanell flow of the data along the

160
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:47,929
yellow arrows data flows from somewhere

161
00:08:47,929 --> 00:08:50,569
the state through a container component

162
00:08:50,569 --> 00:08:52,819
to a presentation component you can call

163
00:08:52,819 --> 00:08:54,829
them smart or dumb components as well

164
00:08:54,829 --> 00:08:59,059
and then if the user clicks something

165
00:08:59,059 --> 00:09:01,459
then that action has an effect and that

166
00:09:01,459 --> 00:09:04,059
along the purple arrows it flows back

167
00:09:04,059 --> 00:09:06,379
ultimately into the state and from the

168
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:08,480
state the new data flows to the

169
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:13,639
presentation components right so of

170
00:09:13,639 --> 00:09:16,309
course the presentation components can

171
00:09:16,309 --> 00:09:17,989
have multiple layers depending on your

172
00:09:17,989 --> 00:09:21,850
composition and we all will test these

173
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:24,529
components in isolation for their

174
00:09:24,529 --> 00:09:27,309
functionality with unit tests I think

175
00:09:27,309 --> 00:09:29,749
today probably everybody is familiar

176
00:09:29,749 --> 00:09:34,519
with unit testing in angular but what

177
00:09:34,519 --> 00:09:38,420
about visual testing wouldn't it be nice

178
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:42,259
if without the whole application you can

179
00:09:42,259 --> 00:09:46,339
just test this component visually what

180
00:09:46,339 --> 00:09:48,970
if you could render it in isolation so

181
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:54,110
that's what I'm going to show you now

182
00:09:54,110 --> 00:10:00,499
and it's gonna be a live example so

183
00:10:00,499 --> 00:10:03,920
fingers crossed and what I will do is I

184
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:06,410
will click quickly show you a sample

185
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:08,420
application that I created for this

186
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:12,499
purpose and then I will tell you how you

187
00:10:12,499 --> 00:10:15,319
can add storybook it's really easy and

188
00:10:15,319 --> 00:10:19,279
storybook will help you with just that

189
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:21,889
so you can render your visual components

190
00:10:21,889 --> 00:10:23,990
in isolation it's also good for

191
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:26,059
documenting all your visual components

192
00:10:26,059 --> 00:10:28,790
then I will show you how you can create

193
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:31,730
a simple story a story is the unit test

194
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:34,399
in storybook or the equivalent of the

195
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:35,959
unit test I will show you what you can

196
00:10:35,959 --> 00:10:38,089
do with more complex components that

197
00:10:38,089 --> 00:10:41,019
have downward dependencies and

198
00:10:41,019 --> 00:10:43,309
ultimately how what you can do with a

199
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:45,679
container component that has maybe a

200
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:47,329
dependency on an asynchronous data

201
00:10:47,329 --> 00:10:52,309
source so then we move on to capturing

202
00:10:52,309 --> 00:10:55,470
images with the story shots Pauline

203
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:57,570
and storing those images for each

204
00:10:57,570 --> 00:11:01,350
component and then later when we change

205
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:03,180
the code you can run it again and

206
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:05,850
compare the new snapshots with the old

207
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:08,280
snapshots so when ultimately you can

208
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:10,380
turn that into an automated visual

209
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:28,780
regression test okay change a bit okay

210
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:34,380
okay all right so is it running it's

211
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:42,420
running okay who likes Star Wars not so

212
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:45,870
many people well okay I'm gonna afford

213
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:48,090
those who lifestyle bores I'm gonna give

214
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:50,490
you a sneak peek into the new movie

215
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:53,100
that's coming in December of course I'm

216
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:55,770
joking right this has nothing to do with

217
00:11:55,770 --> 00:11:58,790
a new movie which we're all eager to see

218
00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:02,160
but instead it's just a silly game that

219
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:07,550
I developed now in this game some virus

220
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:10,700
spread over the galaxy and some

221
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:13,260
well-known Star Wars characters turned

222
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:16,050
into zombies and now your test will be

223
00:12:16,050 --> 00:12:19,020
in the game to fight against the zombies

224
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:22,140
so all right here we have the zombies

225
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:24,030
the team zombies and then on the other

226
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:26,070
side we have the so-called renegades

227
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:27,900
there they are

228
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:31,260
people from both sides right and the

229
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:33,660
computer already chose me an opponent

230
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:36,480
from the zombies so let me choose

231
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:40,680
somebody well let me choose Bo and let's

232
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:44,100
fight okay so pong po1 it's by the way a

233
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:47,100
sophisticated machine learning algorithm

234
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,960
that calculates the winner based on

235
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:54,270
different properties okay okay so

236
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:57,900
another fight oh not looking good

237
00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:03,480
so yeah as you can see unfortunately who

238
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,820
did I choose well anyway it turned into

239
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:08,839
a zombie so I only have two team

240
00:13:08,839 --> 00:13:12,819
let's hope okay okay I'm doing good oh

241
00:13:12,819 --> 00:13:17,600
nice so I might actually even this oh

242
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:21,470
yeah I defeated the zombies great so

243
00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:25,910
that's the the application now okay so

244
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:27,350
let's let's take a look at this

245
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:29,059
application so you can kind of imagine

246
00:13:29,059 --> 00:13:33,410
that maybe this is a component write a

247
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:35,509
low-level presentation component and

248
00:13:35,509 --> 00:13:38,360
then the whole team is rendered with

249
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:41,769
another component there kind of has a

250
00:13:41,769 --> 00:13:46,660
dependency on this component so let's

251
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:50,709
okay so let's take a look at the

252
00:13:50,709 --> 00:13:54,259
structure quickly so I'm not going to go

253
00:13:54,259 --> 00:13:56,600
into the details but I'm serving the the

254
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:59,089
backend for this application from my

255
00:13:59,089 --> 00:14:01,249
local machine so I have a rest server

256
00:14:01,249 --> 00:14:03,110
and on top of that I have a graph cure

257
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:08,149
server for another talk but for now I'm

258
00:14:08,149 --> 00:14:10,069
going to just going to focus on the

259
00:14:10,069 --> 00:14:16,669
clients part and in this clients I have

260
00:14:16,669 --> 00:14:19,819
a couple of libraries and most

261
00:14:19,819 --> 00:14:21,919
importantly I have the presentation

262
00:14:21,919 --> 00:14:24,829
components right so in the presentation

263
00:14:24,829 --> 00:14:26,419
components I have all the components

264
00:14:26,419 --> 00:14:29,779
that are dumb components operate with

265
00:14:29,779 --> 00:14:36,019
inputs and outputs okay so how can I

266
00:14:36,019 --> 00:14:39,949
then take this component and render it

267
00:14:39,949 --> 00:14:43,999
in isolation so for this I can install

268
00:14:43,999 --> 00:14:46,160
storybook storybook I'm not going to

269
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,949
actually install it I cheated and I

270
00:14:48,949 --> 00:14:53,089
already installed it but then I'm gonna

271
00:14:53,089 --> 00:14:56,779
just stop the application and run

272
00:14:56,779 --> 00:15:02,989
storybook and if I run storybook evil in

273
00:15:02,989 --> 00:15:09,769
a second just building it's really quick

274
00:15:09,769 --> 00:15:13,339
by the way compared to maybe compiling a

275
00:15:13,339 --> 00:15:14,460
larger application

276
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:18,750
okay so by default I don't have any

277
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:23,130
stories right so let's create one story

278
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:26,730
which as I said is a unit test for

279
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:28,529
original digital company you can think

280
00:15:28,529 --> 00:15:32,130
about a unit test like unit so I'm going

281
00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:37,459
to go here make it larger

282
00:15:37,459 --> 00:15:40,560
okay I'm gonna copy the name of this

283
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:43,170
component and then create a new file I'm

284
00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:49,459
gonna name it dot stories dot yes okay

285
00:15:49,459 --> 00:15:54,029
so it's an empty file so how do I create

286
00:15:54,029 --> 00:15:57,720
a unit test here okay I'm writing

287
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:00,839
stories off and I'm obviously there can

288
00:16:00,839 --> 00:16:04,050
be multiple test cases for this

289
00:16:04,050 --> 00:16:06,750
component but this is going to bundle

290
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:11,459
the test cases here so I'm going to just

291
00:16:11,459 --> 00:16:16,589
name it after the component okay and

292
00:16:16,589 --> 00:16:24,300
then I'm going to I'm going to name this

293
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:28,800
test case and I'm going to name it

294
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,260
renegade view because I want to render a

295
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:38,970
renegade character there so okay I'm

296
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:41,490
adding the function that configures this

297
00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:49,410
story and what I do just simply yes I'm

298
00:16:49,410 --> 00:16:56,610
specifying the component so with that so

299
00:16:56,610 --> 00:16:59,490
with that if I go back tada

300
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:03,029
storybook recognize my story and it

301
00:17:03,029 --> 00:17:05,250
already rendered something now of course

302
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:07,500
this component has a couple of inputs

303
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,929
that I am not supplying here so it

304
00:17:09,929 --> 00:17:11,939
doesn't look good right now but you can

305
00:17:11,939 --> 00:17:13,439
see that on the left side I have the

306
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:16,110
collection of my stories just currently

307
00:17:16,110 --> 00:17:19,650
just one okay so what do I do about it

308
00:17:19,650 --> 00:17:24,300
well in this props property I can supply

309
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:26,049
some inputs to my

310
00:17:26,049 --> 00:17:32,039
opponent so I can say I want this name

311
00:17:32,039 --> 00:17:48,460
and I have an image URL as well and it's

312
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:51,820
if I did it right

313
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:58,009
no just one more zero all right sorry

314
00:17:58,009 --> 00:18:02,059
as you can see I have I have worked with

315
00:18:02,059 --> 00:18:04,250
this particular presentation component

316
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:06,289
without any other parts of the

317
00:18:06,289 --> 00:18:09,049
application I supply the inputs and I

318
00:18:09,049 --> 00:18:11,720
got it rendered on the screen very nice

319
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:14,419
but if you go into this component you

320
00:18:14,419 --> 00:18:16,190
can see that there are some other inputs

321
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:21,049
here that I am missing already so what I

322
00:18:21,049 --> 00:18:24,639
can do is just copy this part right and

323
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:27,259
I'm gonna name it

324
00:18:27,259 --> 00:18:30,980
zombie view why not and then I'm going

325
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:37,759
to say zombie true and okay I have this

326
00:18:37,759 --> 00:18:40,909
other story here so yeah

327
00:18:40,909 --> 00:18:45,220
renegades Amba view I have some other

328
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:50,610
some other things here as well so I can

329
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:57,590
say selected I'm gonna say zombie true

330
00:18:57,590 --> 00:19:01,720
and so at the - and I will name it some

331
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:09,830
selected okay and it's there but I have

332
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:12,710
one problem in the CSS there is some

333
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:15,740
negative margins there so what do I do

334
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:18,799
about it so you can get you get the idea

335
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:21,440
you can define these stories with

336
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,120
multiple combinations of the input

337
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:26,870
properties and storable storybook will

338
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:30,139
just pick up those and it will render

339
00:19:30,139 --> 00:19:34,090
them so now I have this problem that

340
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:40,460
it's slightly off the screen okay so

341
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:42,710
what I can do about that is that I can

342
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:46,250
say instead of this part I can say

343
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:51,950
template template and I can just put an

344
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:59,410
HTML template there

345
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:07,650
just a second okay okay so here I have

346
00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:10,950
the component and put it to some work

347
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:11,790
right

348
00:20:11,790 --> 00:20:15,630
why doesn't it work well if I am

349
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:18,720
specifying the template I will I will

350
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:24,560
also have to add a decorator here and

351
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:30,190
what I'm doing with this really is

352
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:33,000
something very similar to an angular

353
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:39,900
module okay so I'm going to say

354
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:43,200
declarations I need to declare this

355
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:50,820
component and I can also do imports okay

356
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:52,380
so this is what I need for this

357
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:54,450
component right and if I go back well

358
00:20:54,450 --> 00:20:57,570
it's there the only problem is whatever

359
00:20:57,570 --> 00:21:01,650
the properties yeah that's not there so

360
00:21:01,650 --> 00:21:06,540
what I can do here as well yes I'm just

361
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:11,430
going to maybe do the name property so I

362
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:14,730
can do something like this I can use the

363
00:21:14,730 --> 00:21:18,030
regular way of data binding that you

364
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:20,750
have in angular and you can see it works

365
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:24,360
so you know this is what you can do with

366
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:27,600
just a simple component so now what I'm

367
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,510
going to do is I'm going to write all

368
00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:33,150
the stories for all the components just

369
00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:48,690
pretty quickly

370
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:55,040
just a second don't need this anymore

371
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:56,730
[Music]

372
00:21:56,730 --> 00:22:00,539
and let's jump over to the master ban so

373
00:22:00,539 --> 00:22:03,609
in the background story book runs and

374
00:22:03,609 --> 00:22:07,720
picks up everything from the master ban

375
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:12,549
so you can see that I have this all all

376
00:22:12,549 --> 00:22:15,039
kinds of you know visual tests for this

377
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:16,779
component now some of these components

378
00:22:16,779 --> 00:22:21,359
for example the team view is a component

379
00:22:21,359 --> 00:22:25,090
that depends on other components so

380
00:22:25,090 --> 00:22:31,119
let's take a look at the HTML okay so

381
00:22:31,119 --> 00:22:34,330
you can see that there is a ng4 here and

382
00:22:34,330 --> 00:22:36,519
then in within the ng 4 I'm using the

383
00:22:36,519 --> 00:22:40,409
character box so what happens here is

384
00:22:40,409 --> 00:22:44,529
I'm using well first of all if I'm if

385
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:46,720
I'm doing multiple stories it's a good

386
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:49,539
idea right - to just create your

387
00:22:49,539 --> 00:22:52,779
properties as constants so you can reuse

388
00:22:52,779 --> 00:22:56,739
them and then in the stories when I'm

389
00:22:56,739 --> 00:22:58,389
adding the decorator and the module

390
00:22:58,389 --> 00:22:59,080
metadata

391
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:02,619
I'm just specifying both components here

392
00:23:02,619 --> 00:23:06,999
right and in this case I'm using this

393
00:23:06,999 --> 00:23:09,460
template but I could just use the

394
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:11,799
regular component version but what's

395
00:23:11,799 --> 00:23:14,859
important here is that I am pretty much

396
00:23:14,859 --> 00:23:18,460
mocking all the upwards dependencies but

397
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:20,619
I am NOT mocking the downwards

398
00:23:20,619 --> 00:23:23,999
dependencies because they I need them to

399
00:23:23,999 --> 00:23:26,980
render this component so this is how I

400
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:31,749
do it and then finally let's take a look

401
00:23:31,749 --> 00:23:33,879
at the container component so by the way

402
00:23:33,879 --> 00:23:39,429
as you can see I can I can use this pipe

403
00:23:39,429 --> 00:23:43,690
to to put my stories into different

404
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:45,789
categories right here I have the

405
00:23:45,789 --> 00:23:47,499
presentation component and then I have

406
00:23:47,499 --> 00:23:50,649
the container components so this is a

407
00:23:50,649 --> 00:23:53,470
container component that depends on some

408
00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:59,350
asynchronous data if you if you go

409
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:08,110
look at the cold air right here you can

410
00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:12,250
see that it has observable data bindings

411
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:16,059
from a service well so what do you do

412
00:24:16,059 --> 00:24:17,890
about this well actually it's no

413
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:21,429
surprise it's just like other unit tests

414
00:24:21,429 --> 00:24:23,799
you need to mock them so you just create

415
00:24:23,799 --> 00:24:26,620
a more class and then in the module

416
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:31,870
metadata you just use it you know as as

417
00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:35,860
the class to provide the real service so

418
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:40,299
that's all right okay so now very

419
00:24:40,299 --> 00:24:46,419
quickly what can you do to store the

420
00:24:46,419 --> 00:24:51,039
images of these components well so there

421
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:53,470
is this plugin called story shots for

422
00:24:53,470 --> 00:24:55,450
story book that you can install I'm not

423
00:24:55,450 --> 00:24:57,250
going to go into the installation

424
00:24:57,250 --> 00:25:00,309
because it's a bit more complicated but

425
00:25:00,309 --> 00:25:02,200
ultimately what's important here is that

426
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:05,230
I have created a separate library just

427
00:25:05,230 --> 00:25:10,600
for the story shots test file it's just

428
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:15,460
one one test file right and the

429
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:17,860
important part in this file is this

430
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:20,380
well I'm where I'm initializing the

431
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:22,299
story shots plug-in so I just tell that

432
00:25:22,299 --> 00:25:25,270
it's the angular framework I give it

433
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:26,830
some configuration now the configuration

434
00:25:26,830 --> 00:25:29,799
you don't need to understand it too much

435
00:25:29,799 --> 00:25:33,340
but it does just point to the stories

436
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:38,650
files and then I am also specifying that

437
00:25:38,650 --> 00:25:43,539
I want to compare newer and older

438
00:25:43,539 --> 00:25:47,320
versions of this component with images I

439
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:51,630
could also do an HTML template compare

440
00:25:51,630 --> 00:25:59,140
but I want to do the images part okay so

441
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:01,470
if I

442
00:26:01,470 --> 00:26:05,879
run this just like a unit test by the

443
00:26:05,879 --> 00:26:10,950
way you need to use jest so it's part of

444
00:26:10,950 --> 00:26:12,990
the configuration if you're not using

445
00:26:12,990 --> 00:26:15,059
just in your angular project you need to

446
00:26:15,059 --> 00:26:18,000
come to your just to run the story shots

447
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,649
plug-in well yeah that's life yeah

448
00:26:22,649 --> 00:26:28,399
and so when I run it it will create

449
00:26:28,399 --> 00:26:31,529
these image snapshots the reason it's it

450
00:26:31,529 --> 00:26:34,559
is a bit slow it's because I configured

451
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:36,659
the plug-in to wait one second before

452
00:26:36,659 --> 00:26:39,899
taking the screen shot because I'm

453
00:26:39,899 --> 00:26:42,029
loading images and although I'm loading

454
00:26:42,029 --> 00:26:45,509
them from my local machine well just to

455
00:26:45,509 --> 00:26:47,549
be sure I configure it for one second

456
00:26:47,549 --> 00:26:52,200
now the result of the oh by the way so

457
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:54,179
you know as you can see everything is

458
00:26:54,179 --> 00:26:56,940
green right when you run it the first

459
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:58,950
time it will just create the snapshots

460
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:02,580
like that and you can for example take a

461
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:04,950
look at it so this is the image created

462
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:08,179
from my component from my you know my

463
00:27:08,179 --> 00:27:11,039
visual unit test that I made in

464
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:15,179
storybook okay so now what can you do

465
00:27:15,179 --> 00:27:18,389
with this why is it useful well you can

466
00:27:18,389 --> 00:27:24,480
go into the CSS variables for example

467
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:27,419
and you know you're wondering what would

468
00:27:27,419 --> 00:27:29,039
happen what would be the effect of

469
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:35,070
changing this well let's run the visual

470
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:37,919
regression test right it takes some time

471
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:44,700
and here because storybook is watching

472
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:47,700
all the files you can actually see if it

473
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:50,669
found something because it will just

474
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:53,220
reload all the files when a new file is

475
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:57,779
written and I hope people to demonstrate

476
00:27:57,779 --> 00:28:01,480
I'm saying come on

477
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:10,030
spits low yes one failed okay

478
00:28:10,030 --> 00:28:15,710
one failed and I can go here to my image

479
00:28:15,710 --> 00:28:22,330
snapshots and I can see a diff and well

480
00:28:22,330 --> 00:28:27,260
okay I hope you can see so there is the

481
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:29,480
old version there is the new version and

482
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:31,640
in the middle you can see the difference

483
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:35,840
now this algorithm works by subtracting

484
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:38,840
the two images and so when you're

485
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:40,250
configuring this whole thing you can

486
00:28:40,250 --> 00:28:43,450
specify a threshold in percent

487
00:28:43,450 --> 00:28:47,000
percentage because sometimes there's

488
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,220
slight changes between you know the

489
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:51,790
images that you don't want to actually

490
00:28:51,790 --> 00:29:00,410
treat as an error yeah so that's it and

491
00:29:00,410 --> 00:29:03,130
so back to this slide

492
00:29:03,130 --> 00:29:07,880
okay so right so so we took a quick look

493
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:10,610
at how you know that the sample

494
00:29:10,610 --> 00:29:12,440
application how to add the new story

495
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:14,930
which is the visual unit test equivalent

496
00:29:14,930 --> 00:29:17,810
in storybook what you can do with more

497
00:29:17,810 --> 00:29:20,900
complex components how you can then

498
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:23,570
create image snapshots store them and

499
00:29:23,570 --> 00:29:26,480
compare them to newer versions and well

500
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,820
automated vision regression test is just

501
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:31,160
as easy as running this process in your

502
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,930
continuous integration as part of your

503
00:29:32,930 --> 00:29:36,470
continuous integration okay

504
00:29:36,470 --> 00:29:40,010
so visual testing is here

505
00:29:40,010 --> 00:29:43,040
don't use your losers trust and there is

506
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,870
really no excuse not to do it because

507
00:29:44,870 --> 00:29:48,200
it's so easy thank you
