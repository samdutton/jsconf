00:00:09,890 --> 00:00:13,950

thank you very much yeah my name is

2
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:16,219
gastonia cincotta and i work

3
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:19,009
company called a way in Sweden where's a

4
00:00:19,009 --> 00:00:21,590
consulting company and always looking

5
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:23,900
out for new talents and we're hiring so

6
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:25,180
please let me know if you're interested

7
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:27,890
but it's in Malmo Sweden so it's a bit

8
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:31,220
far for me and like roughly one year ago

9
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:34,190
I started to get interested in two

10
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:36,860
different topics one was hype meet AP

11
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:40,879
ice and briefly speaking it's about

12
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:43,400
avoiding putting application logic in

13
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:47,210
your API clients and then adaptive web

14
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:49,309
design I also started to get really

15
00:00:49,309 --> 00:00:51,589
interested in and briefly it's about

16
00:00:51,589 --> 00:00:54,409
coping with the multi-device web in a

17
00:00:54,409 --> 00:00:56,960
good way I think what I found out was

18
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:01,159
that these two solutions to problems

19
00:01:01,159 --> 00:01:03,229
were actually or of course independent

20
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:05,720
solutions to the different problems they

21
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:07,460
were kind of working together in a nice

22
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:10,189
way and I've thought like hey maybe you

23
00:01:10,189 --> 00:01:13,729
can combine these two in in some form ok

24
00:01:13,729 --> 00:01:17,750
so I'm going to demo a Kanban board for

25
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:21,320
you written with so which is on HTML

26
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:24,230
have media API and it's using adaptive

27
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:26,210
web design at the same time so it's both

28
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:29,300
a web and then API and there are some

29
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:33,170
rules attached to this Cameron board the

30
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:34,520
first rule is that you are only allowed

31
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:38,390
to move one state at a time and another

32
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:40,370
rule is that you're from the downstate

33
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:42,440
you are only allowed to go back to the

34
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:46,900
working state so simple but a few rules

35
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:54,979
so let's fire up yep so this is probably

36
00:01:54,979 --> 00:01:57,409
what you expect so I'm not a great

37
00:01:57,409 --> 00:02:01,390
designer but anyway so you can move this

38
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:05,930
tasks to different states and yeah

39
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:09,590
that's about it but it I think it's also

40
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:12,879
nice to accept having this overview

41
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:15,890
being able to focus more on just doing

42
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:17,870
one thing like I want to work on things

43
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:19,790
and then I then I can verify that our

44
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:24,590
market has done so I can be in focused

45
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:28,819
in this in just a working state and then

46
00:02:28,819 --> 00:02:29,760
I can pull

47
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:36,810
more work to that I work on and yeah

48
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:40,110
it's verified so and still I have a

49
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:42,989
read-only view of of the board so that I

50
00:02:42,989 --> 00:02:48,000
know what I'm doing so let's see how

51
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,459
this thing works with our JavaScript

52
00:02:50,459 --> 00:02:54,810
enabled so as you can see there's a lot

53
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:57,239
of JavaScript going on here for example

54
00:02:57,239 --> 00:03:01,739
the navigation isn't loaded and the

55
00:03:01,739 --> 00:03:06,299
board is not there but I can still pull

56
00:03:06,299 --> 00:03:10,200
some items and work with them so this is

57
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,329
just to demonstrate what's going on with

58
00:03:12,329 --> 00:03:19,859
JavaScript and what's not so this page

59
00:03:19,859 --> 00:03:30,840
is also a mobile web page using former

60
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:35,250
responsive web design and of course it's

61
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:37,049
looking huge here but on a cell phone

62
00:03:37,049 --> 00:03:40,459
it's actually quite looking quite okay

63
00:03:40,459 --> 00:03:44,160
and the board here is yeah just a list

64
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:48,449
of all the states this is particular not

65
00:03:48,449 --> 00:03:51,150
particular interesting perhaps but if i

66
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:57,329
take the exact same same view as this

67
00:03:57,329 --> 00:04:01,829
but on the api pissed api perspective we

68
00:04:01,829 --> 00:04:04,980
see that yeah maybe you don't see that

69
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:07,139
but it's it's exactly the same thing

70
00:04:07,139 --> 00:04:10,139
being rendered almost exactly so this is

71
00:04:10,139 --> 00:04:13,590
an HTML have media API and you can move

72
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:18,539
things here interact with with yet it as

73
00:04:18,539 --> 00:04:20,310
a regular HTML just strip the sea

74
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:23,820
systems and script tags and if you go to

75
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:27,150
the source you can read a bit about the

76
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:29,460
media type that I've used a documented

77
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:34,139
the media type kind of boring text with

78
00:04:34,139 --> 00:04:37,590
some important classes that you should

79
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:40,620
know about some names and some

80
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:43,289
relationships how what

81
00:04:43,289 --> 00:04:49,050
some forms mean semantically and I have

82
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:51,749
implemented a tiny Ruby client like ADA

83
00:04:51,749 --> 00:04:55,460
lines of code that consume this this

84
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:59,249
hypermedia API in HTML so I can move

85
00:04:59,249 --> 00:05:01,559
things for example from the working

86
00:05:01,559 --> 00:05:04,199
state to the backlog the kind of simple

87
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:08,539
interface and move them back and forth

88
00:05:08,539 --> 00:05:12,830
okay so how am i doing in time here

89
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:20,009
eight minutes yeah okay so what's going

90
00:05:20,009 --> 00:05:27,349
on so first let me back up a few levels

91
00:05:27,349 --> 00:05:30,959
if you have this kind of rules like

92
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:33,169
business rules application rules what

93
00:05:33,169 --> 00:05:36,270
allowed items can go to different states

94
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:38,249
depending on which state you're in or

95
00:05:38,249 --> 00:05:40,139
perhaps if you have a different user

96
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:42,389
roles for example admins can do more

97
00:05:42,389 --> 00:05:45,300
than regular users or so what are they

98
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:47,279
allowed to see and do and perhaps you

99
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:49,620
have some different rules depending on

100
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:52,469
both the items state and the user state

101
00:05:52,469 --> 00:05:55,709
then I think it makes sense to not have

102
00:05:55,709 --> 00:05:58,080
this kind of application logic on all

103
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,240
your clients because then you will have

104
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,229
duplicated code and that's regular bad

105
00:06:03,229 --> 00:06:05,610
so it might be a risk that you have

106
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:08,279
actually different applications deployed

107
00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:10,889
because they have you have missed some

108
00:06:10,889 --> 00:06:13,409
you have a bug in some some part of the

109
00:06:13,409 --> 00:06:15,119
workflow and one client and that's not

110
00:06:15,119 --> 00:06:17,639
good also it's hard when you deploy you

111
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:18,749
have to have a synchronized deployed

112
00:06:18,749 --> 00:06:20,430
because you don't want applications are

113
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:22,289
be different you know this is important

114
00:06:22,289 --> 00:06:25,229
stuff business-centric stuff probably

115
00:06:25,229 --> 00:06:28,110
what allowed States and and user

116
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:30,839
authentication and authorization the

117
00:06:30,839 --> 00:06:32,279
thing that should be in the API

118
00:06:32,279 --> 00:06:34,889
centralized but then we have another

119
00:06:34,889 --> 00:06:37,830
problem and that is how do is how can we

120
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:40,110
like Express like we tell the clients

121
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:42,389
about these workflows and rules in a

122
00:06:42,389 --> 00:06:45,389
good way and the only way I know of is

123
00:06:45,389 --> 00:06:48,360
to use rest and more specifically rest

124
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:51,749
level three hypermedia controls so let's

125
00:06:51,749 --> 00:06:55,589
talk a bit about hide media api's so

126
00:06:55,589 --> 00:06:56,849
what is the

127
00:06:56,849 --> 00:06:59,099
the hypermedia constraint in roy

128
00:06:59,099 --> 00:07:03,860
Fielding's restful architecture style

129
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:06,779
there's a bigger paragraph written by

130
00:07:06,779 --> 00:07:08,429
roy fielding but you're more put severe

131
00:07:08,429 --> 00:07:12,089
LM alliant ly by saying you do stuff by

132
00:07:12,089 --> 00:07:13,800
reading pages and then either follow

133
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,439
links or submit forms and if you think

134
00:07:16,439 --> 00:07:19,709
about it it's exactly the same way as we

135
00:07:19,709 --> 00:07:22,080
as human beings interact with the web we

136
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,959
see them something we follow a link or

137
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:27,629
submit the form and now the challenge is

138
00:07:27,629 --> 00:07:30,719
just how to teach how to code both the

139
00:07:30,719 --> 00:07:33,389
api's and the clients to kind of teach

140
00:07:33,389 --> 00:07:36,479
the machines how to interpret this these

141
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:40,709
links and forms and meet the data and so

142
00:07:40,709 --> 00:07:45,330
I really like using HTML as to as the

143
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:48,089
media type for my API and there's a lot

144
00:07:48,089 --> 00:07:51,209
of reasons for this one reason is that

145
00:07:51,209 --> 00:07:53,550
HTML is actually one of the most

146
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:55,949
competent media types it's the media

147
00:07:55,949 --> 00:07:59,429
type of most hyper media controls it's

148
00:07:59,429 --> 00:08:01,259
also very old it's like almost 20 years

149
00:08:01,259 --> 00:08:03,509
old now it's been standardized over and

150
00:08:03,509 --> 00:08:06,839
over again and I mean if you ask any

151
00:08:06,839 --> 00:08:09,959
available like if you show them some

152
00:08:09,959 --> 00:08:13,050
HTML they will like oh that is HTML hey

153
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:15,269
everybody knows about it right but it's

154
00:08:15,269 --> 00:08:17,069
which is not something that we could say

155
00:08:17,069 --> 00:08:20,180
about many days and based media types

156
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:23,279
also there's great tool in sport you

157
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:24,779
notice this thing called the browser

158
00:08:24,779 --> 00:08:27,749
which allows you to visualize your media

159
00:08:27,749 --> 00:08:29,819
type that it would take that for granted

160
00:08:29,819 --> 00:08:32,219
but if you compare with Jason based

161
00:08:32,219 --> 00:08:34,110
media types well yeah that would be a

162
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:37,229
bit harder right also on the service

163
00:08:37,229 --> 00:08:38,819
side you have template engines you have

164
00:08:38,819 --> 00:08:41,370
instant exhale adding more and more

165
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:43,709
advanced stuff which I think think is

166
00:08:43,709 --> 00:08:47,880
really good fun thing I like with HTML

167
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:50,189
as a media type is it's great for

168
00:08:50,189 --> 00:08:52,439
learning about hide media may be in

169
00:08:52,439 --> 00:08:54,240
production for some reason you don't

170
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:58,589
want to use HTML but if you want are

171
00:08:58,589 --> 00:09:00,689
interested in hive media that can

172
00:09:00,689 --> 00:09:03,360
recommend you start with HTML since its

173
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,949
baked in from the beginning and it's

174
00:09:04,949 --> 00:09:06,389
ubiquitous and you have all these tools

175
00:09:06,389 --> 00:09:07,040
and knowledge

176
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:11,949
okay so just a quick interlude here I

177
00:09:11,949 --> 00:09:16,040
think Jason is okay it's it's nice I

178
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:19,790
like Jason based media types I think

179
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:22,160
it's very exciting that all these new

180
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,110
media types are coming up all the time

181
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:27,170
basically based on Jason and I mean the

182
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:29,509
more the merrier it's just harder for us

183
00:09:29,509 --> 00:09:31,130
to choose but that's that's a luxury

184
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:35,209
problem right now I really like HTML as

185
00:09:35,209 --> 00:09:40,639
the media type for my API so and that's

186
00:09:40,639 --> 00:09:42,829
maybe yeah you should try it at least

187
00:09:42,829 --> 00:09:46,910
and see what you think but to be honest

188
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:49,610
I think I don't think that HTML vs jason

189
00:09:49,610 --> 00:09:52,399
is a pretty big deal I think that the

190
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:54,279
real barrier to entry is actually

191
00:09:54,279 --> 00:09:58,430
building and consuming on the clients

192
00:09:58,430 --> 00:10:01,639
consuming hyper hyper media itself even

193
00:10:01,639 --> 00:10:04,670
in Jason you have just kind of think in

194
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:07,430
a hypermedia aware way what are the

195
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:10,069
links for other forms how can I yet

196
00:10:10,069 --> 00:10:15,350
program for this so yeah let's so you

197
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:20,029
need a way to expose the metadata of in

198
00:10:20,029 --> 00:10:22,100
HTML you can't can I need a semantic

199
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:27,310
layer on top of HTML and that is

200
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:30,230
something i like to use is microformats

201
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:32,839
and a new version here come back forms

202
00:10:32,839 --> 00:10:36,589
to as you see there's convention here

203
00:10:36,589 --> 00:10:38,600
like one character and the dash

204
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:41,569
conveying that that there is this is

205
00:10:41,569 --> 00:10:44,240
marquis format so it's nothing no no

206
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:48,500
other type of cloth so about topmost

207
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:51,470
here you see we have an item entity with

208
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:53,209
some properties name status descriptions

209
00:10:53,209 --> 00:10:57,880
and then some forms and links and if we

210
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:01,939
drill down in the forms you see that we

211
00:11:01,939 --> 00:11:05,480
have two forms here one form that will

212
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:10,730
move this item to the backlog it go and

213
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:14,509
go into that action that URL URL and

214
00:11:14,509 --> 00:11:16,639
another one that will move this item to

215
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:18,829
Rivera Phi state and this is the next

216
00:11:18,829 --> 00:11:20,810
primary state

217
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:22,810
remove an item this is the default state

218
00:11:22,810 --> 00:11:25,670
this is this kind of metadata that you

219
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:28,430
would like to send to the clients so you

220
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:34,640
can change them in an easy way okay so

221
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:37,430
as I said in the beginning I saw some

222
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:39,860
kind of commonalities between HTML hide

223
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:42,580
media AP is an adaptive web design and

224
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:45,920
let me be more specific I saw some

225
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,410
commonalities between html5 media api's

226
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:53,480
and mobile first so both of them want to

227
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:57,680
kind of send as minimal data packages as

228
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,410
possible because as an API you young you

229
00:12:00,410 --> 00:12:01,850
don't want to send a necessary stuff

230
00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:05,570
will be angry clients done and also on

231
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:08,270
mobile you would like to be very careful

232
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:09,770
with sending lots and lots of data

233
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:12,050
because yet the two limited screens

234
00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:15,080
screen size bandwidth and maybe the user

235
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:18,589
is paying for data but that's only like

236
00:12:18,589 --> 00:12:22,190
one goal the another goal for both of

237
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:23,600
them is that you want to minimize the

238
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,210
number of round trips to achieve the end

239
00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:28,880
users intent so say you don't want to

240
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,920
follow links like 10 links and have

241
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:33,350
really tiny packages so this kind of

242
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:35,839
these two are kind of working against

243
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:37,700
each other and you have to optimize that

244
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:39,230
in a way that's specific to your

245
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:41,930
application and your domain and I think

246
00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:44,300
that this is common for both I've having

247
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:49,370
me day p ice and mobile first so let's

248
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:55,040
see how I'm doing in time so just super

249
00:12:55,040 --> 00:13:01,850
briefly about mobile first you if you if

250
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:07,030
you go this this road with just loading

251
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:10,880
the most important thing first for a

252
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:13,640
mobile page and this is this kind of

253
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:15,770
taking the almost to the extreme but

254
00:13:15,770 --> 00:13:18,110
like the most important thing for the

255
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:20,990
user was that well if it's a user follow

256
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:23,150
the link to an article that's the

257
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:26,150
article if the user want to tweet that's

258
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:28,850
the four-link the form of the tweets and

259
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:32,839
you know navigation is secondary it's

260
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:33,990
something that's set

261
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:36,990
gives one or two seconds later that's

262
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:40,020
not a primary content so you show the

263
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:41,730
thing here the primary content and then

264
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:44,279
you have links it's a lot of other stuff

265
00:13:44,279 --> 00:13:47,550
and then using a technique called

266
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:50,250
aggressive enhancement you can kind of

267
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:54,839
load follow the links and with Ajax

268
00:13:54,839 --> 00:13:58,649
pulling the content in and replacing the

269
00:13:58,649 --> 00:14:02,040
link with the probably not the entire

270
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:04,290
page but at least a fragment and this

271
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:05,940
can be achieved also on the server side

272
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:10,380
to play and of course then it could be a

273
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:13,589
lot of Ajax requests and then you can

274
00:14:13,589 --> 00:14:16,320
start to bundling the your quest making

275
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,240
sure the API and the clients like take

276
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,850
several alias aquest and sending their

277
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:23,220
number wire yeah and the server knows

278
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:25,709
about that bundling together sending

279
00:14:25,709 --> 00:14:27,990
packing up yep so you can be effective

280
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:29,940
in that way and then you need to think

281
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:31,980
hard about different cache profiles for

282
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:34,800
different links okay just to be

283
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,740
transparent here what you can do then is

284
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:42,720
to to decide the same time around time

285
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,420
if what what those things you want to

286
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:48,149
include and eventually you will end up

287
00:14:48,149 --> 00:14:51,060
with on a full screen and good bandwidth

288
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:54,899
and whatever a desktop web so building

289
00:14:54,899 --> 00:15:01,520
from mobile first to a desktop web so

290
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:07,200
and so this is kind of a one technique

291
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,930
in a deputy web design aggressive

292
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:11,660
enhancement or conditional lazy loading

293
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:13,649
there's a lot of different things

294
00:15:13,649 --> 00:15:16,829
different techniques and FD webassign be

295
00:15:16,829 --> 00:15:18,839
responsive responsive web design being

296
00:15:18,839 --> 00:15:21,570
perhaps the most popular of these

297
00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:23,790
techniques and its really an umbrella

298
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:26,700
term of a lot of different techniques

299
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:29,600
that and it's being developed and

300
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:33,180
examined really really a lot of a lot

301
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:36,720
now which i think is really exciting but

302
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,660
all these techniques are built on a

303
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:42,180
single simple principle called

304
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:45,980
progressive enhancement which is

305
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:48,800
starting with something simple that

306
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,230
everybody can use and then optimize from

307
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:54,560
that and this principle is perhaps

308
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,750
something that some of you here might

309
00:15:56,750 --> 00:16:00,410
like I might not like but I I think it's

310
00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:03,380
a good idea and but not for all thing I

311
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:05,240
mean if you build a 3d shooter game in

312
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:08,600
JavaScript come on it's it's impossible

313
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,950
to do that but forgets of announcement

314
00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:12,680
and that's of course a gray zone where

315
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:15,680
you don't really know if it's an app or

316
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,930
if it's more content based web but I

317
00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:21,920
think we are yeah and some some apps

318
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,450
should be content based web and some

319
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:26,450
content based web should be apps but I

320
00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:35,890
think this is a nice principle to use so

321
00:16:35,890 --> 00:16:38,960
but I'm so what I fine fine found out

322
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,400
and what I've been trying to tell you

323
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:44,360
here is that html5 media AP ice and

324
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:47,960
adapt and mobile first there can they

325
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:50,510
are friends there are kind of the same

326
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:52,790
thing they optimizing for two things to

327
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:54,530
minimize the data and minimize the

328
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:57,140
number of round trips and then mobile

329
00:16:57,140 --> 00:17:00,410
first is friends with all other web

330
00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:01,910
browsers all the web web experience

331
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:04,250
because you can use adaptive web design

332
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:06,590
to make better experience for better

333
00:17:06,590 --> 00:17:10,910
browsers so this means that HTML have

334
00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:13,910
media api's since all of my of your

335
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:18,040
friends or my friends that you can use

336
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:20,630
HTML at midday p ice and mobile first

337
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:23,540
and all web browsers and devices with

338
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:25,940
adaptive web design so you can combine

339
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:28,340
these two and the api in the web can be

340
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:32,600
the same thing so what something

341
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:34,820
important to think about if you combine

342
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:37,820
these two the web and api you need to

343
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:45,350
have an exit strategy because if you for

344
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:48,740
some reason would like to split in a

345
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:50,660
half year one year or three years from

346
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:53,870
now it would be kind of stupid if all

347
00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:56,150
you both your api clients and your web

348
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:58,240
browsers went to the dub dub dub site

349
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,100
so you have some can't you have to have

350
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:02,020
some some separation on your your eye

351
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:05,230
level maybe you can have some duplicated

352
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:07,540
dns entry or you can have two

353
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:09,670
deployments point it to the same

354
00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:13,780
database or yeah it's up to you there

355
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:15,400
are some other things that you should

356
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:18,700
think about and I've been time to cover

357
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:22,030
them during this presentation but if you

358
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:23,620
had you can see if you have the same

359
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:25,660
code base for your web and a pie you

360
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:28,450
should as a previously just just you

361
00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:30,910
have to separate your eyes first that's

362
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:34,210
a simple thing to do then you optimize

363
00:18:34,210 --> 00:18:36,429
the response sizes the package sizes and

364
00:18:36,429 --> 00:18:39,040
the number of RAM trips both for your

365
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:41,679
API and your mobile web and you might be

366
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:45,040
surprised to see that well oh there's

367
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:47,860
notice you have a summary site summary

368
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:51,190
page on my work mobile web but I don't

369
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:53,710
have that in my API and then you might

370
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:56,260
SSS ok why don't we have that in our API

371
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:58,090
maybe that would be a good thing to

372
00:18:58,090 --> 00:19:01,000
present for any client right and then so

373
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,100
it's the kind of helping each other also

374
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:07,630
in the in the design process and you can

375
00:19:07,630 --> 00:19:10,200
use microphones to as the semantic layer

376
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:14,530
but there's also other other ways of

377
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:16,900
doing that for example using our EF a or

378
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:21,130
our if a light and then you can use

379
00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:24,309
aggressive enhancement to make the

380
00:19:24,309 --> 00:19:28,720
mobile first page b-but be better to

381
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:31,150
pull in more content with Ajax if you

382
00:19:31,150 --> 00:19:32,800
have a bigger screen size for example or

383
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:37,059
based on some other parameters and you

384
00:19:37,059 --> 00:19:38,740
should use other adaptive web design

385
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:40,570
techniques for example responsive web

386
00:19:40,570 --> 00:19:43,660
design or yeah you have a bunch to

387
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:46,090
choose from and it's yeah like I said

388
00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:48,880
it's a huge topic and then you can

389
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:53,410
optimize the api api like i did i can

390
00:19:53,410 --> 00:19:57,520
show you if you don't remember this is

391
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:01,360
just it has not no script script

392
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:05,710
includes no no script tags know CSS

393
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:09,280
includes and if you look at this you see

394
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,600
that

395
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:14,200
there's old oh there's just the

396
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:17,340
microformats class information so in the

397
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:20,799
here I have some more classes for

398
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:25,320
styling but those you can strip away in

399
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:33,700
your templates so so now I want to make

400
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:39,760
a quick demo again how you can do if you

401
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:42,970
want to change your application so what

402
00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:45,539
I want to do is that I want to add an

403
00:20:45,539 --> 00:20:50,080
archive state after done that you can

404
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,450
you can move back and forth between the

405
00:20:52,450 --> 00:21:00,250
done and archive so let's go into the

406
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:08,530
here maybe that's better so this is of

407
00:21:08,530 --> 00:21:11,080
course prepared in the routing and the

408
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:23,379
controller actions but so

409
00:21:23,389 --> 00:21:25,710
so make a transition from down to

410
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:31,980
archive and my my convention is that the

411
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:33,450
last thing here in the list is the

412
00:21:33,450 --> 00:21:35,460
primary action just something that I

413
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:38,850
that it shows and from archive you can

414
00:21:38,850 --> 00:21:46,490
go back to them okay let's see how the

415
00:21:46,490 --> 00:21:55,740
consultant reacts on this one oh there's

416
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:58,620
a little thing from the past how

417
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:02,100
embarrassing but I can move this anyway

418
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:05,100
i can move things from the verify to the

419
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:09,480
done from the dom to the to the archive

420
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:16,320
and then I can move it back to done like

421
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:22,049
that so this was a thing that that I

422
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:24,000
didn't have to change one line of line

423
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,789
of code in my Ruby client and of course

424
00:22:26,789 --> 00:22:34,799
the the web will also be enhanced with

425
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:37,529
the archive and you can move things back

426
00:22:37,529 --> 00:22:41,220
and forth here okay and so if you think

427
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:43,350
about it if I wanted to make this change

428
00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:47,639
on for example on iphone android on the

429
00:22:47,639 --> 00:22:50,220
web and different clients i had to like

430
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:53,370
do this do a split and like hand out

431
00:22:53,370 --> 00:22:54,960
different user stories four different

432
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,059
teams or persons and they we have to

433
00:22:57,059 --> 00:22:59,340
synchronize and we have to deploy this

434
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:02,759
and in a synchronized way but here i

435
00:23:02,759 --> 00:23:05,220
could just add one line of code and the

436
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:14,330
changes it's done so

437
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:20,170
okay so just a quick summary I think

438
00:23:20,170 --> 00:23:23,440
that and and this is perhaps the center

439
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:27,310
of my talk that html5 media api's and

440
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:30,490
mobile first are really very much in

441
00:23:30,490 --> 00:23:36,040
common and then other other persons have

442
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:39,280
showed that mobile first and all the

443
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:42,280
rest of the web browsers are really

444
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:44,680
friends because you said after web

445
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:46,780
design techniques to make it's just one

446
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:50,680
web right so and this means that html5

447
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:53,800
me AP ice and the web can be the same

448
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,150
thing and you can have the same code

449
00:23:55,150 --> 00:23:59,250
base for your web and your API so

450
00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:02,220
there's some good books on hypermedia

451
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:05,590
and on adaptive webassign this is just a

452
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:09,220
few of these geo goes there's also some

453
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:12,760
links online good slide decks

454
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:14,980
presentations and there's a good site

455
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:16,660
called the resource oriented client

456
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:19,570
architecture by a guy called step step

457
00:24:19,570 --> 00:24:22,450
until Cove and two other guys that I

458
00:24:22,450 --> 00:24:25,270
really recommend you to to read actually

459
00:24:25,270 --> 00:24:27,400
if you follow one one of these links you

460
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,470
should go to the research on to client

461
00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:30,730
architecture I think it's really great

462
00:24:30,730 --> 00:24:33,820
and his I guess is from Berlin at least

463
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:38,950
his German Stefan tylko so thank you

464
00:24:38,950 --> 00:24:41,110
very much for listening to me here's my

465
00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:45,400
Twitter the code is available on github

466
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:49,720
the demo is actually running right now

467
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:53,380
on Heroku deployed both esta at Ft web

468
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:58,000
design site and as an API and I kind of

469
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,860
blocked it so you can't add items but

470
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:01,180
you can change and do whatever you want

471
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:03,780
and then the slides are available here

472
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:09,580
at the bottom so and I'll happy to ask

473
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:12,090
questions to answer questions later

474
00:25:12,090 --> 00:25:15,070
perhaps during lunch and thank you so

475
00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:17,170
much for inviting me and for having an

476
00:25:17,170 --> 00:25:28,419
often awesome conference so far
