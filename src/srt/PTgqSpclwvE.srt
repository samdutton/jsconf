00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:09,260

hello

2
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:11,990
I forgot to turn my screensaver off so

3
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:18,020
give me a second yay okay so I'm here

4
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:20,300
today to talk to you about the Internet

5
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:24,860
of cats or trying new things is scary my

6
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:26,690
name is Rachel white I'm oh ho on

7
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:29,060
Twitter I'm a front-end engineer at IBM

8
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:32,330
Watson and I live in New York so let's

9
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:37,699
go this is me I love cats it might be

10
00:00:37,699 --> 00:00:39,500
hard to see I can't see that screen

11
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:42,830
right now but um this is in Tokyo last

12
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:45,589
fall at a cat cafe and I am covered in

13
00:00:45,589 --> 00:00:48,170
about eight different cats that just so

14
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:50,089
happened to blend in with the couch it

15
00:00:50,089 --> 00:00:52,040
was one of the happiest moments of my

16
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:56,299
life and I I've always kind of liked

17
00:00:56,299 --> 00:00:59,449
cats and tried to have ideas of like how

18
00:00:59,449 --> 00:01:01,940
can I incorporate cats into technology

19
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:05,960
um but trying new things is scary and

20
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm mostly a front-end person like I

21
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,430
don't do hardware for my job I don't

22
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:12,380
really do back end except now because

23
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:13,670
they're making me and I can't really

24
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:16,460
argue with them um so I was like okay

25
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:18,590
how am I going to put this together and

26
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:22,460
I decided to think of ways that I could

27
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:25,970
try something new the ways that I think

28
00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:27,410
that trying things that are new or scary

29
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:29,540
is like you're trying something new from

30
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:31,370
the beginning it's a totally new project

31
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:33,260
you don't know how it's going to turn

32
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:36,170
out maybe it'll suck maybe nobody like

33
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:38,620
it maybe it won't even work who knows

34
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:40,790
using new technologies for the first

35
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:43,610
time is always scary to like you don't

36
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:45,170
know if all the documentation is there

37
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:46,820
you don't know if people are going to be

38
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:48,530
there to be available to help you out

39
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:50,630
you just you don't really know what's

40
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:54,140
going to happen also scary is

41
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:56,090
contributing to open source in general

42
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:58,340
and I knew that I wanted to contribute

43
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:01,940
an open source but I was afraid of all

44
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:04,010
of the negativity around close

45
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:06,530
communities and stuff and I was like how

46
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:09,500
am I going to do this pretty much like

47
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:12,050
putting yourself out there in general is

48
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:16,099
pretty terrifying let's talk about why

49
00:02:16,099 --> 00:02:19,730
it's scary for a little bit um like I

50
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:22,470
said you know maybe people laid it

51
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:24,510
maybe they won't like your project maybe

52
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:26,580
they'll think your code sucks maybe

53
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:28,170
they'll think you're stupid if they're

54
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:31,250
jerks and think that that matters

55
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:33,870
imposter syndrome sucks like are you

56
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:35,970
even good enough to finish this project

57
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:38,520
like will you be able to handle the code

58
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,570
if it's something that you're not

59
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:42,930
particularly familiar with and the

60
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:45,060
inclusiveness of communities I see this

61
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:48,330
happen more with smaller projects that

62
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:50,880
have a certain amount of contributors

63
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:53,040
that have always been contributing to it

64
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,770
and if somebody comes in and wants to

65
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:57,900
change something sometimes I'll just get

66
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:02,240
ignored or sometimes people just will be

67
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:06,630
be very receptive to the feedback a bad

68
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:08,820
behavior in open source in general and

69
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:11,520
in tech I've seen a lot of people on

70
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,380
github lately that are just the

71
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:15,120
equivalent of a Twitter egg where

72
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,250
they're anonymous they don't provide

73
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:20,280
anything really productive other than

74
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,170
complaining about terminology code

75
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:24,720
conducts that kind of stuff which gets

76
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,160
me into people complaining about code of

77
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:28,769
conducts existing which if you're a good

78
00:03:28,769 --> 00:03:31,050
person you shouldn't complain about that

79
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:34,680
obviously um so some examples of bad

80
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:37,050
behavior that I've seen our feigned

81
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:39,480
ignorance uh which is I've encountered

82
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:42,150
in jobs before where instead of giving

83
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:43,980
constructive criticism if something

84
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:45,330
doesn't if somebody doesn't know

85
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:47,730
something that you just go oh you didn't

86
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:49,650
know about this like you should have

87
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:51,299
known instead of just telling you about

88
00:03:51,299 --> 00:03:53,780
it so you don't have to ask again

89
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:56,310
completely ignoring contributions and

90
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:58,530
open source stuff so if somebody you

91
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:00,480
know takes the time to want to

92
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,620
contribute to something that you're a

93
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:03,660
part of and you just ignore them it's

94
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:04,920
not going to make them want to

95
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,540
participate in the future which isn't a

96
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:09,989
way to grow communities alternately for

97
00:04:09,989 --> 00:04:11,549
maintainer is a demanding user base

98
00:04:11,549 --> 00:04:14,370
which if you notice I've talked to a

99
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:16,590
couple people about this as soon as

100
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:19,500
somebody open sources a new project

101
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:24,780
usually the the first like slow of open

102
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:26,970
pull requests or issues will be people

103
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:30,840
complaining about spelling grammar they

104
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,070
don't like the way that certain things

105
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:34,590
are done and just like complaining in

106
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:35,440
general in

107
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,520
of being happy that there's something

108
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:40,240
new for them to try and also useless

109
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,770
pull requests for the sake of a green

110
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:45,700
timeline you don't need to be that

111
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:47,830
person that makes the first pull request

112
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:50,110
fixing a couple commas and periods just

113
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:52,690
for the sake of like commenting first on

114
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:55,150
a post it's like your github timeline is

115
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:57,100
not an indicator of your self-worth and

116
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:58,570
I really wish that more people would

117
00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:05,290
realize that also insulting the

118
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:08,080
contributor uh I don't even know why

119
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,780
this I have to say this it makes no

120
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:13,030
sense you shouldn't insult people that

121
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:14,740
are trying to be productive just don't

122
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:17,800
do it or disagreeing over trivial things

123
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:20,140
by trivial things I guess it's not

124
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:22,840
really trivial but there's been a lot of

125
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,550
stuff lately with people complaining

126
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:26,680
about wanting to change terminology and

127
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,750
get rid of the master-slave terminology

128
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:31,090
which is completely warranted and you

129
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:33,160
shouldn't argue over it if it's still

130
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,450
going to function the same way but not

131
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:38,680
make people uncomfortable so when I was

132
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,360
like starting on this project and

133
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:43,120
wanting to get involved in open source

134
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,720
and see how other people that I interact

135
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,180
with which are mostly women in tech I

136
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:52,030
polled on Twitter to see what kind of

137
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:55,210
experiences people have and I'm just

138
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:58,720
going to read them to Jen shipper said

139
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,169
vulgar and brutal harassment expectation

140
00:06:02,169 --> 00:06:04,300
and entitlement of your time without any

141
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:08,910
compensation offered the next one is

142
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:11,260
unfortunately the harassment was enough

143
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:13,120
for me to stop trying before I had other

144
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:16,300
problems so that's where I met so they

145
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:17,680
didn't even get to the point where they

146
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,360
were contributing because of the

147
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,600
harassment in general this next one's

148
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,760
anonymous because they didn't even want

149
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,380
to be attached for fear of further

150
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:29,590
harassment entitlement of time the

151
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:31,419
assumption you immediately want feedback

152
00:06:31,419 --> 00:06:34,330
when you're just starting nerd pedantic

153
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:38,740
and obstructing learning a co-worker of

154
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:41,340
mine and friend Caroline said

155
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:43,960
mansplaining mainly in a general fear

156
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:46,120
that any commit I make will be open as

157
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:46,950
an issue

158
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:49,680
debated about Caroline's involved a lot

159
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:54,140
with like security stuff and she has a

160
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:56,970
legit reason for being afraid because

161
00:06:56,970 --> 00:06:59,790
she has gotten doxxed and your family

162
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:01,950
has gotten swatted it's like not cool

163
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:05,730
that these things happen and the next

164
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:08,220
one is sent a pull request with bug

165
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:10,230
fixes that got ignored for almost a year

166
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:12,450
after which the maintainer wrote the

167
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:18,330
same fixes and said oops next is Tess

168
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:21,390
who also said mansplaining my own code

169
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:24,270
to me and trolling Tess is pretty

170
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:26,520
relevant because she open source

171
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:29,670
something a little bit last year called

172
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:31,920
echo chamber j/s which is all of the

173
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:34,410
commenting none of the comments what it

174
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:35,910
is is it's a third-party script that you

175
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:38,220
add to your website that utilizes local

176
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:40,350
storage with your comments form so all

177
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:42,480
the people that want to say garbage will

178
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:45,690
post hit that send button it'll store

179
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:47,370
locally on their machine and look at the

180
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:48,900
feel proud of themselves for being an

181
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:51,270
asshole that nobody else ever has to see

182
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:54,300
it which is really awesome and uh when

183
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:57,500
she made this which is clearly like not

184
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:00,270
serious more of like social commentary

185
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:03,290
on internet comments she got trolled

186
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:06,750
this this awesome kind gentleman with

187
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:09,350
the Steve Jobs I calm it says I dead

188
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:13,110
opened a pull request or an issue that

189
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:15,630
says you're fat and then they were like

190
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:17,250
that's not enough so they changed it

191
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:19,080
from your fat to your fat and insecure

192
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:23,370
and then another one from ghost too I

193
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:25,740
believe is one of those people that only

194
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:29,370
complains on repositories and maybe like

195
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:31,260
commits to some things I'm going to read

196
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:32,580
this whole thing because it's really sad

197
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:34,770
I'll read it maybe I'll be quick web

198
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:36,330
development or web design does have a

199
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:38,280
psychological part besides the technical

200
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:40,170
part and this library is intended to

201
00:08:40,170 --> 00:08:41,760
give the illusion to the user that he

202
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,490
and gate he engages with the website by

203
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:46,800
commenting it it clearly has the intent

204
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,080
or to do poor trick the end user as no

205
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,790
indication is given that his or her

206
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:52,170
message will not be sent through the

207
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:55,500
network I'm I'll skip the next one and

208
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,420
it says such library seems to rise

209
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:59,400
epical concerns about the relationship

210
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,780
between the maintainer of the

211
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:03,090
site and the end user it is promoting

212
00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:04,860
relationships based on duping another

213
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:06,930
that is a form of irresponsibility and

214
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:09,780
indifference is it any good just asking

215
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:11,400
to myself and I'm going to go ahead and

216
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,680
answer him and say no nobody was you

217
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,450
 and you shouldn't feel entitled to

218
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:20,610
and you shouldn't feel entitled to
even say this stuff so when coming for a

219
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:22,890
new project my proposal for new

220
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:24,600
contributors which is something that I

221
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,820
did myself is find something you're

222
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:29,550
passionate about for me it's cats in a

223
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:33,600
totally healthy way I swear or something

224
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,280
new that you want to try it for me it

225
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:38,300
was hardware and some back-end stuff

226
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:40,980
make something cool and open source at

227
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:43,260
yourself which is this grade school

228
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:45,660
science project with popsicle sticks and

229
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:48,960
tape and wires because when you do that

230
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,940
the first point of contact for use your

231
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:52,770
peers and people that respect you as a

232
00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:53,970
human being you're going to give you

233
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:56,790
constructive constructive criticism

234
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:58,860
which is a billion times more helpful

235
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:04,530
than randos being jerks so these are my

236
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:08,450
cats their names are Rick Deckard and

237
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:12,000
reset smith rick is fat and reset is

238
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,920
very handsome I like cats a lot I've

239
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,540
been talking about building a cat feeder

240
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:20,460
bought forever to the point that I think

241
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:22,020
I just annoyed some of my friends and

242
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:24,660
they were like just do you have to do it

243
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:28,650
so you shut up about it from past j/s

244
00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:32,100
comps in Florida I had loved my brief

245
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,660
experience with the node box community

246
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:37,020
it's so friendly and really helpful the

247
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:39,480
documentation is amazing and all the

248
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,950
people are really great and plus there's

249
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:43,470
slack channels there's get er channels

250
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:45,420
people even answer you on Twitter even

251
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:46,890
when you sometimes don't want them to

252
00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:50,820
it's like excessively helpful so I

253
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:52,770
decided to build a node-based cat feeder

254
00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:54,840
that works over the web and that's this

255
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:59,610
thing and it is robo kitty here's my

256
00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:01,209
cats again

257
00:11:01,209 --> 00:11:03,670
that's reset I said he was handsome and

258
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:08,410
that's fabric so the tech that I picked

259
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:12,850
for this project was no jeaious Johnny 5

260
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:16,410
which is a JavaScript robotics library

261
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:19,749
socket i/o and then when I was trying to

262
00:11:19,749 --> 00:11:21,699
decide what microcontrollers to use I I

263
00:11:21,699 --> 00:11:24,339
struggled a little bit first I I wanted

264
00:11:24,339 --> 00:11:26,019
the Arduino Uno because it already has

265
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:28,360
that Internet connectivity no it does

266
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:31,360
not and that's why it didn't work so I

267
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,339
grabbed the Arduino you which does have

268
00:11:33,339 --> 00:11:35,019
the Internet connectivity but it wasn't

269
00:11:35,019 --> 00:11:37,149
compatible with Johnny 5 and then I

270
00:11:37,149 --> 00:11:39,309
finally settled on particle photon so I

271
00:11:39,309 --> 00:11:41,350
spent a lot of money so you don't have

272
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:45,819
to UM the part list for this is a

273
00:11:45,819 --> 00:11:49,059
typical dry goods dispenser which I got

274
00:11:49,059 --> 00:11:50,889
on amazon it's the kind that they put

275
00:11:50,889 --> 00:11:53,800
cereal in at hotels for continental

276
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:56,399
breakfast it's about twenty dollars a

277
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:58,839
particle photon kit with a breadboard

278
00:11:58,839 --> 00:12:01,269
which also runs like twenty thirty

279
00:12:01,269 --> 00:12:04,360
dollars a continuous servo which is

280
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:08,589
taped on to the front and a four double

281
00:12:08,589 --> 00:12:10,660
a battery pack with on/off switch which

282
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:12,850
I would not recommend instead figure out

283
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:13,990
how to plug it in because that thing

284
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:17,350
eats batteries like crazy and a

285
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:18,970
miscellaneous harp and miscellaneous

286
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:20,649
hardware accessories that I use our male

287
00:12:20,649 --> 00:12:23,439
to male jumper wires which are for

288
00:12:23,439 --> 00:12:27,339
connecting the breadboard to the servo

289
00:12:27,339 --> 00:12:30,129
and I had to solder a little bit and

290
00:12:30,129 --> 00:12:33,040
some heat-shrink so never having worked

291
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,509
with any of this stuff before i bought

292
00:12:34,509 --> 00:12:36,850
it all and I'm at home I kind of have an

293
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:38,589
idea in my head of like how it's going

294
00:12:38,589 --> 00:12:41,799
to work from point A to point B and then

295
00:12:41,799 --> 00:12:44,410
I'm like this otter trying to like put

296
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:46,059
all the pieces together and I was like I

297
00:12:46,059 --> 00:12:47,649
really i don't i don't know what I'm

298
00:12:47,649 --> 00:12:52,209
doing I mean in short like things pretty

299
00:12:52,209 --> 00:12:54,819
pretty much one smoothly except that

300
00:12:54,819 --> 00:12:57,819
electricity scares me I don't understand

301
00:12:57,819 --> 00:12:59,679
Ohm's law at all so I thought that I was

302
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:01,240
going to constantly electrocute myself

303
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:03,069
which wouldn't really be possible even

304
00:13:03,069 --> 00:13:04,990
with the amount of power coming through

305
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:07,839
there now that I know I also didn't

306
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:09,850
realize that I needed to externally

307
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:12,830
power the servo I was like all right

308
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:15,560
this microcontroller has power so if i

309
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:18,140
plug this into the microcontroller then

310
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:21,740
it should work right no it doesn't i

311
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:24,590
also had no idea how to solder when i

312
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:27,020
began now I know how to solder I'm

313
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:29,450
really good at it but um so what I did

314
00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:31,610
is I went on YouTube and I googled how

315
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:33,680
to solder as you do when you don't know

316
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,690
how to do something and the video

317
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:38,290
results that I got was a very helpful

318
00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:40,610
doomsday prepper he was wearing full

319
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:43,760
camouflage he had I don't know probably

320
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:47,180
like ready to eat MRE food rations and

321
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:49,220
he was just like take this wire you take

322
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:50,930
this wire and he didn't even like try

323
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:52,640
and preach about any other things it was

324
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:56,770
really great so then I was ready to test

325
00:13:56,770 --> 00:14:01,580
the code was working awesome i'm using

326
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:03,950
cronjob currently because i wanted to

327
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:05,600
not only have it dispensed food

328
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,320
immediately i also wanted it to be timed

329
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,610
there's better ways to do it you can

330
00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:12,320
open a pull request if you want to fix

331
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:15,230
it for me and the server was strong

332
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:16,640
enough to turn the feeder handle which i

333
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:18,170
was a little bit worried about if you

334
00:14:18,170 --> 00:14:20,420
have it totally full is food gonna come

335
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:23,330
out so everything's working great except

336
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:25,400
it wouldn't stop at all if you push the

337
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,900
button like everything that was in there

338
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:28,520
would just keep on coming out on all

339
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:30,500
over the floor and like fatrick loves

340
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,660
that but that's like the opposite of

341
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:36,350
what I wanted to happen so I do what I

342
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:37,850
always do when that something doesn't

343
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:39,320
work which if you follow me on Twitter

344
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:41,060
I'm sure you saw this morning because I

345
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:43,670
couldn't get it to work I started

346
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:48,080
freaking out I just like yell and I'm

347
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:51,680
like why what's happening I'm sad it's

348
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,570
probably Rick Waldron's fault cuz it's

349
00:14:53,570 --> 00:14:56,060
fun to blame things on him it wasn't

350
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:59,780
this time it was that time though but I

351
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:01,670
looked my peers for help like I

352
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:03,350
mentioned before the get er chat was

353
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:06,260
amazing Brooklyn jas which is where i'm

354
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:08,390
from made a no BOTS room so i would stop

355
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:11,810
bothering them in dms people reviewed my

356
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:13,880
code actually soos who's talking

357
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,230
tomorrow reviewed my code and she was

358
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:17,930
like nothing's wrong it looks great and

359
00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:19,930
then I was like well what's happening

360
00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:23,120
but then something awesome happened it

361
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,980
was a bug in Johnny 5 and it was Rick

362
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:27,249
Waldron's fault

363
00:15:27,249 --> 00:15:30,230
so I I tweeted the code from my

364
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:32,569
automated feeder is done if I didn't

365
00:15:32,569 --> 00:15:34,910
already have a cat named Rick I'd name

366
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:38,989
the one after Rick Waldron and he he

367
00:15:38,989 --> 00:15:42,319
found the bug he fixed it and then it

368
00:15:42,319 --> 00:15:45,230
worked and that felt so good because if

369
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:46,669
somebody else wants to build it and it

370
00:15:46,669 --> 00:15:48,999
didn't work that would be a huge problem

371
00:15:48,999 --> 00:15:52,549
now I'm going to show you a little bit

372
00:15:52,549 --> 00:15:54,199
of the server code as it was when I

373
00:15:54,199 --> 00:15:57,559
first wrote it um this was my first time

374
00:15:57,559 --> 00:16:00,169
trying any of this stuff so I kind of

375
00:16:00,169 --> 00:16:03,019
just like dumped it into a huge file and

376
00:16:03,019 --> 00:16:05,869
this was done in November and it since

377
00:16:05,869 --> 00:16:08,149
evolved into way more elaborate stuff

378
00:16:08,149 --> 00:16:10,609
but i'll show you this a little bit i

379
00:16:10,609 --> 00:16:14,389
have like a regular node app running I

380
00:16:14,389 --> 00:16:16,910
didn't have any routing at the time you

381
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:18,499
just set up your little server thing

382
00:16:18,499 --> 00:16:20,689
sorry wordwrap is on but i'm not going

383
00:16:20,689 --> 00:16:23,119
to scroll over this is how you set up

384
00:16:23,119 --> 00:16:26,689
your board with Johnny Five and then the

385
00:16:26,689 --> 00:16:29,410
cron job is really ugly but there it is

386
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:33,379
and then once it's on and connected what

387
00:16:33,379 --> 00:16:35,809
it's doing is it tells the servo to stop

388
00:16:35,809 --> 00:16:38,839
in case it's on already which I don't

389
00:16:38,839 --> 00:16:40,579
know why it would be it's just like just

390
00:16:40,579 --> 00:16:43,549
in case you're on stop and then it turns

391
00:16:43,549 --> 00:16:45,169
on a little bit and goes backwards in

392
00:16:45,169 --> 00:16:46,789
case there's a jam and then turns

393
00:16:46,789 --> 00:16:49,850
forward again and is like yeah there's

394
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:51,949
food and it's set to New York so

395
00:16:51,949 --> 00:16:53,809
obviously if you're not in New York and

396
00:16:53,809 --> 00:16:55,339
you want to feed your cats on our normal

397
00:16:55,339 --> 00:16:56,779
schedule you'd have to change that and

398
00:16:56,779 --> 00:16:59,539
then so that's the server code and then

399
00:16:59,539 --> 00:17:01,399
the client code before routing was added

400
00:17:01,399 --> 00:17:06,230
in was just a plain website and it sets

401
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:07,939
it to every few hours and then clear

402
00:17:07,939 --> 00:17:10,010
schedule and then there's some inline

403
00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:13,309
script at the bottom and the site's

404
00:17:13,309 --> 00:17:15,110
really cute because it's on theme and it

405
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:16,490
looks like this which I'll show you a

406
00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:19,970
little bit later so once it works the

407
00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:22,650
cats were like yeah

408
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:26,030
this is not a picture of rec I promise

409
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:29,160
so I was almost ready to open source it

410
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:31,530
I was getting really close things were

411
00:17:31,530 --> 00:17:34,080
working out great and I put a call out

412
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,820
on Twitter for code reviews because I

413
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:37,710
wanted you know people that I trust to

414
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:40,590
check it before people tear it apart and

415
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:42,660
the response was pretty pretty

416
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:45,450
overwhelming so many people helped me

417
00:17:45,450 --> 00:17:47,640
out the contributions went from like

418
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:50,520
just me like sad at my coffee table

419
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:52,350
because my apartments not big enough for

420
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:54,930
a dining room table to like a ton of

421
00:17:54,930 --> 00:17:58,710
contributions they added in a routing

422
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:01,620
ave refactor did there's like an NPM

423
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:04,410
module I don't even know if it's done um

424
00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:07,220
but yeah they had they helped a lot and

425
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:10,920
then I was I just told you all this and

426
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,420
they review the readme for language

427
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:14,250
that's like the biggest part of this

428
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:16,320
project since I didn't know what I was

429
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:19,200
doing when I started I wanted to write

430
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,620
the readme as if someone that had no

431
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:24,330
idea what they were doing technically

432
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:28,320
could go in and get the code and do

433
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,540
everything step by step so I made no

434
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:32,280
assumptions it's really long and

435
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:33,990
honestly writing language that was

436
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:36,300
accessible to anyone without like

437
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:37,890
guessing what their technical background

438
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:39,990
was was probably harder for me than this

439
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:42,740
whole entire project but I wanted

440
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:45,030
somebody if they were interested in it

441
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:46,500
to have the same experience that I had

442
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,150
when I was interested in no bots and be

443
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:50,580
able to just like pick things and then

444
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:52,320
go find out how to do it and be able to

445
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:55,890
set it all up and after they did all

446
00:18:55,890 --> 00:18:57,510
this for me like the most exciting thing

447
00:18:57,510 --> 00:18:59,250
for me was that they actually liked it

448
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:02,400
so I was really happy and then I got to

449
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,310
test it with the cats um it worked it

450
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:07,740
used to be cardboard but cardboard

451
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:10,230
doesn't travel really well and popsicle

452
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:13,110
sticks does better Rick was my tester

453
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:17,700
and we got this really cute animation of

454
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:21,270
him being like yeah it's time to eat so

455
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:24,750
it worked really well I was ready to

456
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:27,090
launch finally and what I did is I

457
00:19:27,090 --> 00:19:30,110
changed the repository to public I

458
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:33,990
tweeted about it for some reason I

459
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:36,029
submitted a link to hacker news

460
00:19:36,029 --> 00:19:39,659
and then I took a nap uh and and when I

461
00:19:39,659 --> 00:19:41,759
woke up from my nap it was on the front

462
00:19:41,759 --> 00:19:43,469
page of hacker news and people weren't

463
00:19:43,469 --> 00:19:45,809
being jerks which is surprising it was

464
00:19:45,809 --> 00:19:47,999
off brand but i was happy although

465
00:19:47,999 --> 00:19:49,950
someone was like you could have done

466
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:51,749
this and I was like whatever you do it

467
00:19:51,749 --> 00:19:55,529
I'll have two people retweeted it a lot

468
00:19:55,529 --> 00:19:57,719
it's like way more than this now and

469
00:19:57,719 --> 00:20:01,049
there's been some forks and requests for

470
00:20:01,049 --> 00:20:02,190
it to be on different microcontrollers

471
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:04,379
which I'm going to do after this because

472
00:20:04,379 --> 00:20:05,909
I spent three hours this morning trying

473
00:20:05,909 --> 00:20:09,239
to get it to work and it was start a ton

474
00:20:09,239 --> 00:20:11,609
it's actually over 700 now which you

475
00:20:11,609 --> 00:20:14,070
know not a matter of your self-worth but

476
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:15,629
it was my first open source project so

477
00:20:15,629 --> 00:20:17,489
it felt really great but the most the

478
00:20:17,489 --> 00:20:19,649
best most exciting part was that I was

479
00:20:19,649 --> 00:20:23,129
huge in Japan and this is like this is

480
00:20:23,129 --> 00:20:25,830
like from what I can gather the the like

481
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:27,749
Japanese equivalent of TechCrunch I

482
00:20:27,749 --> 00:20:30,570
guess um there's something lost in

483
00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:32,339
translation they assumed that I had

484
00:20:32,339 --> 00:20:34,799
never done any programming whatsoever so

485
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:36,210
that's probably why they wrote about it

486
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:37,499
they thought it was a lot cooler than it

487
00:20:37,499 --> 00:20:41,519
actually was or cats who knows so the

488
00:20:41,519 --> 00:20:42,659
things that I learned from this whole

489
00:20:42,659 --> 00:20:44,729
project was um don't be afraid of the

490
00:20:44,729 --> 00:20:47,279
unfamiliar because what you don't know

491
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:49,139
at the beginning you will know at the

492
00:20:49,139 --> 00:20:50,519
end and then you'll be able to tell

493
00:20:50,519 --> 00:20:53,119
other people about it and everybody wins

494
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:55,859
also uh don't be afraid to ask for help

495
00:20:55,859 --> 00:20:58,649
this is something that I had struggled

496
00:20:58,649 --> 00:21:01,499
with for a while due to like bad

497
00:21:01,499 --> 00:21:04,080
experiences in tech but people that are

498
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,330
like willing to help you are are great

499
00:21:06,330 --> 00:21:08,669
and then once they help you you can help

500
00:21:08,669 --> 00:21:10,379
other people and it's just an endless

501
00:21:10,379 --> 00:21:14,279
nice cycle of helping people really like

502
00:21:14,279 --> 00:21:20,700
cats unless you don't and then why don't

503
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:23,070
downplay your abilities when I started

504
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:25,499
talking about this project I was like I

505
00:21:25,499 --> 00:21:29,219
mean it's just a microcontroller turning

506
00:21:29,219 --> 00:21:31,529
his servo but I probably should have

507
00:21:31,529 --> 00:21:33,269
been like it's a really awesome cat

508
00:21:33,269 --> 00:21:35,339
feeder and like the only person that was

509
00:21:35,339 --> 00:21:37,349
probably like not the only person the

510
00:21:37,349 --> 00:21:38,759
person thought it was the coolest was my

511
00:21:38,759 --> 00:21:40,289
mom and she was like you should hire a

512
00:21:40,289 --> 00:21:41,820
lawyer and get a patent I was like mom

513
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:43,919
that's not what open sourcing is like

514
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:45,779
and I don't care and if you saw this

515
00:21:45,779 --> 00:21:49,170
thing you would not agree

516
00:21:49,170 --> 00:21:51,630
also I really really really like node

517
00:21:51,630 --> 00:21:54,090
BOTS there's so much fun there's so many

518
00:21:54,090 --> 00:21:55,500
things that you can do with it I mean

519
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:58,650
you can pretty much pick there's a ton

520
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:00,690
of different microcontrollers and then

521
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:02,850
you're just like I want to connect a

522
00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:05,580
light or a switch or a button or a

523
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:07,710
potentiometer or an accelerometer and

524
00:22:07,710 --> 00:22:09,810
they'll tell you exactly how to do it

525
00:22:09,810 --> 00:22:11,520
and then you can do silly things like

526
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:17,520
this and now is the moment of truth all

527
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:22,680
right let's see if this demo works give

528
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:29,910
me one second I'm gonna close this no

529
00:22:29,910 --> 00:22:39,060
doubt yes it is connected localhost this

530
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:41,490
is Bravo kitty isn't it cute I'm gonna

531
00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:43,980
turn the battery on and there is candy

532
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:45,630
in here so if you like candy on the

533
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:55,779
floor it's your lucky day

534
00:22:55,789 --> 00:22:59,570
I'm gonna let it all right now all right

535
00:22:59,570 --> 00:23:02,239
and then they have one more thing to

536
00:23:02,239 --> 00:23:04,850
show you not on the feeder and it's

537
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:10,970
basically just the end of my talk so

538
00:23:10,970 --> 00:23:14,479
yeah thank you I'm oh ho on twitter if

539
00:23:14,479 --> 00:23:16,669
you want to contribute to the repository

540
00:23:16,669 --> 00:23:20,210
at all it's rachel nicole / robo kitty

541
00:23:20,210 --> 00:23:23,629
and my website is rachel is awesome with

542
00:23:23,629 --> 00:23:25,940
a dot Emmy and I'm cool online for all

543
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:27,649
the weird stuff that I like to make and
