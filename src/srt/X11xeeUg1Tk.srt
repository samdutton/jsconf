[Music]

2
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:17,580
thanks Jessica I so um guess this is the

3
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:21,350
last round of talks at CSS calm so sad

4
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:24,150
let's get the party started so we can go

5
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:28,170
to the party afterwards I want to first

6
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:30,210
off say a big thanks to the organizers

7
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:32,850
they put together a beautiful amazing

8
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:35,399
wonderful event so if you guys could all

9
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:37,620
give the organizers a round of applause

10
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:44,100
I owe them all so much for helping me

11
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:47,760
out so and I'm completely honored to be

12
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,559
up here with all these other great

13
00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:52,260
speakers I do have to give a quick

14
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:56,070
disclaimer really quick my slides do

15
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:58,379
feature some like optical illusions and

16
00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:01,530
animations that if you feel like visual

17
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:04,199
sensitivity I will not be offended if

18
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:06,060
you need to get up and like go outside

19
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:08,490
and take a walk because you have to take

20
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:12,000
please take care of yourself first I'll

21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,350
try to give you a warning before

22
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:17,640
something visually animated pops up on

23
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:20,460
the screen but today we're going to talk

24
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:23,460
about CSS and art history and all of the

25
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:25,159
wonderful things that we have in common

26
00:01:25,159 --> 00:01:30,390
as a front-end developer we work in an

27
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:33,000
industry where our job is to build

28
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,520
things for public consumption and the

29
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,259
thing is is that often like we're given

30
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:43,770
sets of designs and photographs and text

31
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:46,020
and we have to put that all together in

32
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:50,990
order to tell a story on a website and

33
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:53,729
what better place to look at for

34
00:01:53,729 --> 00:01:56,340
inspiration of visual storytelling than

35
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:02,579
art history so the object of art is not

36
00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:05,130
to reproduce reality but to create a

37
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:08,030
reality of the same intensity and

38
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:10,580
effective storytelling in our

39
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:14,660
it comes from a long long history of

40
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:17,540
patterns and symbolism and visual cues

41
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:19,970
that have been developed over the course

42
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:23,810
of time and what's interesting is that

43
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:25,580
today we're kind of in the opposite

44
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:29,060
situation back in medieval times and in

45
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:30,890
the Renaissance illiteracy was the

46
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:34,060
majority of like people weren't as

47
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:36,080
capable of reading as they are today

48
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,480
obviously and when we work on websites

49
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:41,750
our job is often to make text available

50
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:47,420
and readable however we're still working

51
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:49,670
in a two-dimensional media we are still

52
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:51,770
working with a screen that has quite a

53
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:53,780
lot in common with the canvas and with

54
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:59,930
the frame so during this talk there's

55
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:01,280
going to be a lot of like little

56
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,160
examples of fun CSS things that I felt

57
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:06,110
inspired to share with you

58
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:08,360
this is one of my favorite websites it's

59
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,220
actually in flash but I'm working on

60
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:13,340
building like CSS JavaScript version of

61
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:15,640
it but I just wanted to show you this is

62
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,810
animated and moves around a lot

63
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:20,239
it's a game called first-person Tetris

64
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:22,700
you can go to first-person Tetris calm I

65
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:32,239
waste a lot of time playing this so

66
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:35,120
instead of the pieces rotating the whole

67
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,750
screen rotates and the reason why I'm

68
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:41,239
showing this to you is because we often

69
00:03:41,239 --> 00:03:43,820
forget that like as long as we look at

70
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:44,900
the physical world the three

71
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:46,519
dimensionality of vision seems to offer

72
00:03:46,519 --> 00:03:48,500
no problem until we recall that the

73
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,810
optical input for all of our visual

74
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:52,910
experience consists of two-dimensional

75
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:56,570
projections on the retina like this is a

76
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:59,330
game but it's also a piece of art

77
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:00,760
because it's a two-dimensional

78
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:04,130
representation of space that you have a

79
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:11,049
three-dimensional relationship with see

80
00:04:11,049 --> 00:04:13,730
I've only ever gotten to level 10 so if

81
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:14,989
you can get past level 10 because it

82
00:04:14,989 --> 00:04:16,669
starts going really fast and then you

83
00:04:16,669 --> 00:04:22,550
get really really dizzy

84
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:28,030
so like I was saying it's we're dealing

85
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:30,370
with like a two dimensional world right

86
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:33,040
on our screens and our screens give us

87
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,840
access to the same things that you have

88
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,190
access to when you're putting together a

89
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:38,050
painting we have access to space and

90
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:40,750
lines and light and color and all these

91
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:42,669
things that come together to make form

92
00:04:42,669 --> 00:04:45,940
which is what we are talking about when

93
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:47,860
we look at art history is the nature of

94
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:51,400
form so let's break that down a little

95
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:57,250
bit more so this is a wonderful Georgia

96
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:59,620
O'Keeffe quote that I love where she's

97
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:03,100
talking about what it is to make art the

98
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:06,070
reason why we elevate art is because art

99
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:10,419
gives you the chance it gives you a

100
00:05:10,419 --> 00:05:13,150
chance to have an intimate emotional

101
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:18,639
relationship with something and that

102
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:20,590
intimate emotional relationship comes

103
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:24,100
from the arrangement of shapes and lines

104
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:26,139
and color and all of these things that

105
00:05:26,139 --> 00:05:30,460
are just two-dimensional tools and we

106
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:34,479
have access to with CSS they all

107
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:38,830
contribute to expression so starting

108
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:41,020
back from like way way beginning these

109
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:42,610
are cave paintings in the South of

110
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:43,240
France

111
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:46,840
from 30,000 to 32,000 years ago it's

112
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,460
kind of hard to carbon-date these things

113
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:50,830
but you can see that there is already an

114
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:53,440
understanding of form like there's white

115
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,270
and there's dark so there's an

116
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:57,900
understanding of highlighting and

117
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:01,180
saturation there's movement the animals

118
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:04,240
are running across the rock right but

119
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,270
just like early web design before we had

120
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:10,060
access to like flexbox and CSS grid and

121
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:11,380
all these really cool things that we

122
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:15,550
have now just like in art history CSS

123
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:18,389
was used in basic motifs that were

124
00:06:18,389 --> 00:06:22,120
changed with trends across time so cave

125
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:24,010
paintings being the earliest and then

126
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:26,830
maybe you look at greco-roman vase art

127
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:28,630
and then you look at the motifs of

128
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:30,880
medieval art they're generally all

129
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,760
sticking to the same motif in the same

130
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,080
way that very very

131
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:37,449
very early web development stuck to the

132
00:06:37,449 --> 00:06:40,780
same motif but then we have the

133
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:45,960
Renaissance and the Renaissance was

134
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:50,259
responsible for basically making us go

135
00:06:50,259 --> 00:06:52,840
from a representational form of art to a

136
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:55,810
realistic form of art and I believe that

137
00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:57,909
right now we exist in a sort of

138
00:06:57,909 --> 00:07:00,939
Renaissance period of CSS where we have

139
00:07:00,939 --> 00:07:02,740
access to all of these wonderful cool

140
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:05,770
new tools but we're still doing the job

141
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:08,669
of tradesmen and craftsmen we're still

142
00:07:08,669 --> 00:07:10,960
dictated to us what it is that we're

143
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:14,050
communicating through our web

144
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:17,560
development onto the screen same as how

145
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,599
the artists during the Renaissance were

146
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:21,550
usually patronized by the Medici in the

147
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:25,930
family and the families in the countries

148
00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:30,009
all across all across Europe and one of

149
00:07:30,009 --> 00:07:33,430
the greatest contributions of the

150
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:35,949
Renaissance to art was the concept of

151
00:07:35,949 --> 00:07:40,599
vanishing point so a vanishing point is

152
00:07:40,599 --> 00:07:43,150
a geometrical representation of an

153
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:47,379
expression of space by locating a point

154
00:07:47,379 --> 00:07:50,050
on the horizon and pulling it into the

155
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:51,539
foreground you're able to create

156
00:07:51,539 --> 00:07:54,339
three-dimensional objects so before

157
00:07:54,339 --> 00:07:56,979
during medieval and like on Greek vases

158
00:07:56,979 --> 00:07:59,110
you would see a very flat

159
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:02,740
two-dimensional picture of a person but

160
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:05,770
now with vanishing points we have the

161
00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:08,849
ability to truly understand space and

162
00:08:08,849 --> 00:08:11,500
here you can see the very famous Last

163
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,539
Supper which is a fresco by Leonardo da

164
00:08:13,539 --> 00:08:16,870
Vinci and here he takes great advantage

165
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:18,909
of the vanishing point but not only that

166
00:08:18,909 --> 00:08:22,620
there's also hidden messages with this

167
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:25,240
composition in and of itself the fact

168
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,849
that the vanishing point is centred and

169
00:08:27,849 --> 00:08:31,089
the horizon is centred is a method of

170
00:08:31,089 --> 00:08:33,180
demonstrating symmetry and symmetry

171
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:35,890
demonstrates perfection because for two

172
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:38,320
things to be equal on both sides that is

173
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,209
perfection and back in the Renaissance

174
00:08:40,209 --> 00:08:42,219
this was considered godliness

175
00:08:42,219 --> 00:08:48,120
so we derive this expectation

176
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,740
perfection and centering and it's

177
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:51,600
probably why all of us have to struggle

178
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,330
with vertical center alignment so much

179
00:08:54,330 --> 00:09:03,930
to this day because of this crap here is

180
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:08,130
a more intense version if after looking

181
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:11,910
at where the horizon exists and the

182
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:13,440
vanishing point exists in the last

183
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,450
supper we can kind of take it to the

184
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:17,580
next level with Rafael in his fresco the

185
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:20,180
School of Athens which is in the Vatican

186
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:23,550
the vanishing point itself is actually

187
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:26,220
between Plato and Aristotle therefore

188
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:28,500
centering our focus on the conversation

189
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,330
that is happening between the two

190
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:32,910
characters in the center however there's

191
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:38,460
also lines of of geometric form that are

192
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:40,980
happening in the foreground and with the

193
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:42,690
crossing of the lines we see that this

194
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:46,850
is like a much more complex version of

195
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:50,160
what was started in the Renaissance like

196
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:58,920
this is the the growth of it and you can

197
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:04,440
do it with CSS this is vanishing points

198
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,990
being executed with prospective origin

199
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:11,700
and because my slides are all HTML and

200
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:19,440
CSS I can show you how I did it so all

201
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,410
this right here is how I'm able to

202
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:24,980
execute the same thing that da Vinci and

203
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:29,670
Raphael executed in my code

204
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:33,120
so using vanishing points also gives us

205
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,510
access to depth and in that same sense

206
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:37,920
that we have access to depth with

207
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,500
vanishing points our screens are like

208
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,120
windows they're showing us what is

209
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,920
within in the same way that a frame

210
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,529
shows you what is within a painting and

211
00:10:46,529 --> 00:10:49,050
this was the big movement that happened

212
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:50,670
in the Renaissance and kind of defined

213
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:54,150
art for the next few motifs into the

214
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:55,510
Baroque period

215
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:58,300
and the neoclassical period which is

216
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:01,840
still kind of happening today I love

217
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:04,630
this piece of art it's cannot pronounce

218
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:06,460
his name I wish I could I'm horrible at

219
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:08,080
pronouncing things but it kind of looks

220
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:11,110
familiar right like you've seen this

221
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:14,380
pose before except not on Law & Order

222
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:20,380
SVU and that's because it is a physical

223
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:23,500
representation of Napoleon the first at

224
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:27,820
his coronation painted by angrist so you

225
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:31,030
can see here the artist Wylie took

226
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:35,140
inspiration and we're still like dealing

227
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:36,970
with depth and dealing with these

228
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:39,310
patterns and we haven't understand

229
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:41,290
inherent cultural understanding of these

230
00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:43,930
patterns like you understand that I see

231
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:47,800
is pronouncing that he is the king but

232
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:51,820
in the same way that IKEA is copying

233
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:57,400
Napoleon Napoleon is copying god this is

234
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:01,240
yawns onyx Ghent Altarpiece God the

235
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:04,150
Father it's a panel within an altarpiece

236
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:06,520
with multiple panels and you can see the

237
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:11,400
similarities between God the Father and

238
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:16,120
Napoleon and we continue to use these

239
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:18,820
similar patterns in CSS with the

240
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:21,340
prevalence of hamburger menus and these

241
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:23,680
representations that we all understand

242
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:26,920
and have a user experience that is

243
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:29,140
cohesive and everyone across the board

244
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:30,970
gets that and so I think that as a

245
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:33,520
community we should always be aware of

246
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,910
those choices that are being made and

247
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:39,700
what that means for the future

248
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,830
generations of web development and the

249
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:48,280
things that we're passing along but you

250
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:51,040
know you don't need to go to school and

251
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,570
get a masters degree to be an artist

252
00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:54,400
anybody can be an artist anybody can

253
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:58,270
create things just like you can create

254
00:12:58,270 --> 00:13:01,350
anything out of CSS with your code and I

255
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:04,150
think that looking at the artists of

256
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:06,130
today is going to help us figure out

257
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:08,300
what the future of CSS looks like

258
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:11,490
after the neoclassical period which was

259
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:13,980
what we just saw with Napoleon we had

260
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:15,420
the advent of photography and

261
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:17,399
photography meant that we no longer

262
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:20,009
needed paintings to represent real life

263
00:13:20,009 --> 00:13:22,500
because with photographs we could

264
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:25,920
document real life much quicker albeit

265
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,139
slightly expensive but not nearly as

266
00:13:28,139 --> 00:13:30,660
expensive as hiring an artist to paint

267
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:32,750
something for you at the same time

268
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:34,889
psychology was being developed and

269
00:13:34,889 --> 00:13:36,990
people were being encouraged to explore

270
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:39,600
their feelings and emotions so during

271
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,790
this period that's when we had the birth

272
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:50,540
of abstract art and now we're looking at

273
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:54,180
not the figure within but the figure on

274
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:57,779
the canvas as a surface is just as

275
00:13:57,779 --> 00:14:00,480
important to look at in terms of art as

276
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,930
the canvas as a window and here we have

277
00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:06,329
a piece by Chuck Close it's a portrait

278
00:14:06,329 --> 00:14:08,730
of Kara Walker who's also a famous

279
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:12,209
artist who I adore and what's

280
00:14:12,209 --> 00:14:14,269
interesting is that Chuck Close

281
00:14:14,269 --> 00:14:16,759
abstracts the portrait by painting

282
00:14:16,759 --> 00:14:19,529
individual water colors just like pixels

283
00:14:19,529 --> 00:14:22,889
and therefore turning our focus away

284
00:14:22,889 --> 00:14:26,370
from the photograph as a whole and the

285
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:28,170
image the figure of Kara Walker as a

286
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:30,029
whole and instead we have a chance to

287
00:14:30,029 --> 00:14:34,170
focus on what is on the canvas and the

288
00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:35,519
texture and the color and the

289
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:38,160
abstraction and I think that we are

290
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,990
going to see more and more of this in

291
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:43,139
the future with CSS as we become more

292
00:14:43,139 --> 00:14:45,839
aware of the screen as a surface as

293
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:50,939
opposed to a window little side trivia

294
00:14:50,939 --> 00:14:53,970
about Chuck Close he has bear with me

295
00:14:53,970 --> 00:14:58,670
while I process Pro so prosopagnosia

296
00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:02,160
which is face blindness so when he

297
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:05,459
paints these portraits he will look at

298
00:15:05,459 --> 00:15:07,470
the photo and look back at the painting

299
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:09,029
and go back and forth and he actually

300
00:15:09,029 --> 00:15:11,370
like doesn't recognize the person while

301
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:13,889
he's doing these paintings which is why

302
00:15:13,889 --> 00:15:16,410
like what people have theorized is why

303
00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:18,779
his painting seems so photographic

304
00:15:18,779 --> 00:15:21,690
because he is so able to

305
00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:24,870
separate himself from the person who

306
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:26,850
he's painting and he just sees the

307
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:30,170
elements of what he's working with and

308
00:15:30,170 --> 00:15:33,930
in the same way that we work with pixels

309
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:36,030
and now we're working with like CSS grid

310
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:38,220
and stuff we can look at this piece and

311
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:41,220
notice how it's being abstracted into

312
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:43,650
something that is completely different

313
00:15:43,650 --> 00:15:45,570
from the way we used to handle art and

314
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:49,800
it ran across this very interesting

315
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:53,150
piece that Ivana showed me earlier today

316
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:55,920
using typography portrait by Carolyn

317
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,230
Portugal she uses typography and SVG

318
00:15:58,230 --> 00:16:01,350
animation to deconstruct and subvert the

319
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:03,570
meaning of the text so just like check

320
00:16:03,570 --> 00:16:05,430
closes subverting the meaning of the

321
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:08,610
portrait we can subvert the meaning of

322
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:11,970
the text that we're given to display on

323
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:14,070
a website to provide information and we

324
00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:15,800
can provide information of our own

325
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:25,480
making

326
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:28,470
even more deeply abstracted we can look

327
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:31,170
at Mark Rothko's paintings of color and

328
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:34,769
when we look at these what you don't

329
00:16:34,769 --> 00:16:37,920
know is that there's tiny thin layers of

330
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,899
color across the whole canvas Mark

331
00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:42,540
Rothko would paint very very thin layers

332
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:44,879
over and over and over to develop this

333
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:49,110
glowing Lumosity something that I akin a

334
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:51,329
lot to the fact that our screens are

335
00:16:51,329 --> 00:16:53,939
actually light glowing from behind and

336
00:16:53,939 --> 00:16:55,860
so I like to look at Rothko and consider

337
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:57,929
the fact that when we're creating

338
00:16:57,929 --> 00:17:00,839
something with CSS oftentimes color and

339
00:17:00,839 --> 00:17:03,089
light have a lot to do with the

340
00:17:03,089 --> 00:17:05,579
expression and the emotion that is

341
00:17:05,579 --> 00:17:08,130
caused by what you're looking at on your

342
00:17:08,130 --> 00:17:11,789
screen in 1816 Schopenhauer wrote on

343
00:17:11,789 --> 00:17:15,089
vision and color which explained his

344
00:17:15,089 --> 00:17:18,209
theory of the physiological rate of

345
00:17:18,209 --> 00:17:22,049
intensity of color saturation and he

346
00:17:22,049 --> 00:17:26,579
developed a spectrum of color that he

347
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:30,210
deemed high too low too high too low

348
00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:32,940
intensity with black on one end of the

349
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:35,520
spectrum moving into violet blue and

350
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:38,429
green green and red being the center the

351
00:17:38,429 --> 00:17:40,679
highest contrasting moving down into

352
00:17:40,679 --> 00:17:43,440
orange yellow and white and you can see

353
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,929
here there's no green there's no red

354
00:17:45,929 --> 00:17:49,679
this is a very subdued painting with

355
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:53,789
notes of violet and notes of blue and we

356
00:17:53,789 --> 00:17:56,580
have a kind of calming sense when we

357
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:58,909
look at this painting the colors

358
00:17:58,909 --> 00:18:04,140
communicate to us a sense of peace but

359
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:05,909
when you look at something like orange

360
00:18:05,909 --> 00:18:09,480
and yellow it drives up your heartrate

361
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:13,020
it gets you excited it is full of

362
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:18,270
intensity and in the same way that you

363
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:21,029
can abstract down a painting into color

364
00:18:21,029 --> 00:18:23,809
to express emotion you can do so with

365
00:18:23,809 --> 00:18:29,730
CSS in the screen and color we can't

366
00:18:29,730 --> 00:18:31,860
always look at color as it really is

367
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:35,140
sometimes it's determined by the context

368
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:37,480
and here light and color help to define

369
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:42,640
space but here we have the absence of

370
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:45,550
color the absence of saturation helps us

371
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:47,680
to define space so this is a piece of

372
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:51,850
optical art by Bridget Riley she was

373
00:18:51,850 --> 00:18:56,080
basically the front runner of this art

374
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:58,990
motif and she was also the first woman

375
00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:00,760
to win an International Prize in

376
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:03,340
painting at the Venice Biennial in 1968

377
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:05,380
and what she's creating here is she's

378
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:07,420
expressing movement by manipulating the

379
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:09,730
surface and depth with the contour and

380
00:19:09,730 --> 00:19:11,650
saturation this is something that we

381
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:14,290
could execute ourselves with code by

382
00:19:14,290 --> 00:19:16,750
manipulating a line by manipulating its

383
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:18,790
curvature and it creates a wonderful

384
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:22,210
sense of tension and sense of movement

385
00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:24,820
across the page even though it's static

386
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:26,680
there's no movement in it but as you

387
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:30,600
look at it it begins to kind of wave

388
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:40,840
back and forth

389
00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:44,179
and to give you a sense of how we can

390
00:19:44,179 --> 00:19:47,380
utilize these abstractions through code

391
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:50,120
this is a project that my friend Ainsley

392
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:54,980
Wagner worked on where she took sound

393
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:58,190
and used it to manipulate an abstract

394
00:19:58,190 --> 00:20:01,000
representation with colors and light and

395
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,139
they just this wonderful performance

396
00:20:03,139 --> 00:20:10,070
piece that I love so this is making art

397
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:13,039
with code this is like the most abstract

398
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:17,990
that you can get and as we move towards

399
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:20,330
pure expression and away from our

400
00:20:20,330 --> 00:20:22,639
dependency on text and our dependency on

401
00:20:22,639 --> 00:20:26,870
like newspapers derivative layouts with

402
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:29,899
columns and rows of text I hope that you

403
00:20:29,899 --> 00:20:31,669
all are a little inspired to go out and

404
00:20:31,669 --> 00:20:35,019
make something fun and interesting thing

405
00:20:35,019 --> 00:20:36,880
thank you

406
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:37,400
[Applause]

407
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:41,300
