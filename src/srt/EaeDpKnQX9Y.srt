1
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:17,570

so rather than this being a presentation

2
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:19,700
which you've had a lot of over the

3
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:22,340
weekend we are the penultimate talk so

4
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:23,900
we thought we'd do something a little

5
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:25,970
bit different we're not exactly famous

6
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:28,250
for any open source libraries or 3d

7
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:29,750
graphics inflammations and JavaScript

8
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:32,029
whatever but we have put on a conference

9
00:00:32,029 --> 00:00:36,590
I don't even write code anymore but we

10
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:38,450
thought we'd do it sort of podcast style

11
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:40,730
and maybe just be a conversation so at

12
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:43,100
any stage we have slides and we put

13
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:45,320
together and we would like to to go

14
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:46,520
through the slides and that's just to

15
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:48,050
keep us on track if we get completely

16
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:50,000
derail but do feel free to derail us

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,400
because it's just kind of it's a

18
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:54,110
conversation so yeah we're gonna kick

19
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:55,640
anyone's gonna kick us off though so as

20
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:57,200
Paul said this isn't a technical talk

21
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,990
this is more of a talk about a journey

22
00:00:58,990 --> 00:01:01,930
well that's very personal to Paul and I

23
00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:03,680
sometimes we shared that journey

24
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,360
together and sometimes we kind of went

25
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,799
our separate ways but always kind of

26
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:10,820
found a road back to each other and on

27
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:13,520
the journey we met many people around

28
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,259
the world in various communities phrase

29
00:01:15,259 --> 00:01:16,850
open source communities developer

30
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:19,430
communities some of them are in this

31
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:22,610
room but all of them in some way kind of

32
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:25,940
guided us helped us along I helped us to

33
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:29,570
kind of really travel this personal

34
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:30,740
journey that we've come through the last

35
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:32,210
couple years ourselves I helped us to

36
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:34,970
understand it um so what does i have to

37
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:38,810
do you guys well we're all really on one

38
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:42,710
journey of some sort or another and you

39
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:44,270
know for example we're all here at JS

40
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:47,330
conf is a journey that you guys are

41
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:48,619
sharing over the course of the weekend

42
00:01:48,619 --> 00:01:50,080
on his a journey that started back

43
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,940
sometime in 2008 I think in the US and

44
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:55,150
in a dive bar in arlington virginia

45
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:58,479
Chris told me earlier on today and and

46
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:00,560
is a journey that started with an idea

47
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:06,530
and like like a great piece of open

48
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:08,030
source code that idea would have been a

49
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:10,970
iterated on and contributed to by

50
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:13,670
multiple people over time so if Amon

51
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:15,530
appears boring to anybody feel free to

52
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:17,299
Gong him so that we move on to the next

53
00:02:17,299 --> 00:02:21,769
slide you're a prick Heyman is the vice

54
00:02:21,769 --> 00:02:23,810
president of engineering at Engine Yard

55
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:27,150
his company orchestra was a PHP

56
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:30,299
Ben platform cloud it was acquired last

57
00:02:30,299 --> 00:02:31,739
year so basically he's better than

58
00:02:31,739 --> 00:02:36,629
everybody here when I met him first he

59
00:02:36,629 --> 00:02:38,549
was developing PHP and I'm pretty sure

60
00:02:38,549 --> 00:02:39,810
he was one of those guys who thought

61
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:41,519
that javascript and jquery were the same

62
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:46,750
thing or started with different things

63
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:49,290
but he did try to make up for his crappy

64
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:52,890
coding with his personality but i think

65
00:02:52,890 --> 00:03:01,349
his coding was better so sorry so last

66
00:03:01,349 --> 00:03:03,510
week he got awarded the the irish

67
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:05,639
internet association from that visionary

68
00:03:05,639 --> 00:03:08,879
award and i remember i remember when i

69
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:11,310
used to like consider the people who won

70
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:18,840
that award with all but seriously has

71
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,790
inspired me to be a better person for

72
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:22,560
the last kind of 56 years that I've

73
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,900
known him I set up a co-working space in

74
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:27,810
Dublin then I am and he was the one that

75
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:30,150
dived in with complete passion and like

76
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:32,129
his passion and his ambition is

77
00:03:32,129 --> 00:03:33,449
completely infectious and I really has

78
00:03:33,449 --> 00:03:35,639
driven me over the last few years I just

79
00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:36,989
definitely feel like a stronger person

80
00:03:36,989 --> 00:03:39,329
when I'm around him and I it's been

81
00:03:39,329 --> 00:03:40,709
awesome and he's really picking up when

82
00:03:40,709 --> 00:03:42,989
she was pursued was down and and kind of

83
00:03:42,989 --> 00:03:45,329
brought me down when I was too cocky or

84
00:03:45,329 --> 00:03:47,519
whatever so Heyman is another he's a

85
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:49,680
great catalyst for ideas and social

86
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,989
change and he's just he's not actually

87
00:03:51,989 --> 00:03:53,370
that bad of a developer i thinks

88
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:55,169
preciate it well you know i didn't know

89
00:03:55,169 --> 00:03:57,139
this is going to turn into a roast and

90
00:03:57,139 --> 00:04:01,109
so all i have to say is Paul Campbell is

91
00:04:01,109 --> 00:04:03,599
a scholar and a gentleman and I'm proud

92
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:13,530
to call my friend so take that yeah

93
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:15,150
people have called fun come from the

94
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:17,010

this podcast does it worry is called

97
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:27,690
shocked and shocked is the Irish word

98
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:32,099
for 47 and why would we choose the

99
00:04:32,099 --> 00:04:35,029
number seven well traditionally

100
00:04:35,029 --> 00:04:37,620
culturally seven has had a significance

101
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:39,630
around the world you can think

102
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:40,689
yourselves are various

103
00:04:40,689 --> 00:04:43,509
apples but you know we have lucky number

00:04:43,509 --> 00:04:46,089
seven and today indeed is the seventh of

105
00:04:46,089 --> 00:04:49,239
October when key dink I think not we

pride takes us back to Dublin from maybe

161
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:20,600
2008 2009 and we was a tech community in

162
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,750
Dublin were quite backward as everything

163
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:28,970
is in Ireland what the and we

164
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:30,680
travel there was a group of us traveled

165
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,540
to San Francisco and after we came back

166
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:35,750
we were inspired to well I wasn't

167
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:38,390
inspired i was just kind of mainly sore

168
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:41,870
um so one amongst the number a guy

169
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:43,280
called anton Mannering he put on a

170
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:46,160
meet-up called tech Lud am it was a

171
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,020
terrible name I mean but he managed to

172
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:50,600
attract tens and was either with more

173
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,970
than 100 people at these made up but it

174
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:54,740
was really great it was it was it was

175
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:55,910
the first time that we felt that there

176
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:57,020
was actually something happening in the

177
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:58,880
community and Ireland and it was so much

178
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,860
it was so bad like that there'd be

179
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:02,750
people putting out open sore her even

180
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,190
success stories and you'd read about

181
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:05,330
them in the newspaper and they lived

182
00:09:05,330 --> 00:09:07,400
like an hour away but there was no there

183
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,990
was no way to go meet them is no action

184
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:10,250
that was the first time that I had ever

185
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:11,900
done it but what was really interesting

186
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:14,090
about it was that one of the kind of

187
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:15,800
entrenched guys who had been running a

188
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:18,020
different set of meetups he was like all

189
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:20,030
know these things are damaging I they're

190
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:21,110
gonna these meetups are gonna be

191
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:22,760
terrible for our and it's gonna be was

192
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,410
really just protecting his own patch you

193
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:27,260
know and it turned out that tax code was

194
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:28,580
amazing and didn't matter that I just

195
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:30,140
 name it didn't matter that it was

196
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:30,320
name it didn't matter that it was
in

197
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,550
crouching on this other our alma mater

198
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:34,910
vs free booze it's pretty much what

199
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:39,560
Kenny I wasn't very funny so anyway the

200
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,660
lesson that I learned any way from back

201
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:44,390
then was that Anton did not need

202
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:46,370
permission to go out and put on this

203
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:47,870
this meetup he just went and did it he

204
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:49,730
went booked a bar and he invited some

205
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:52,040
people and loads of people showed up and

206
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,300
I went but for the first time I met I

207
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:55,010
thought meet up just a bunch of Irish

208
00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:57,740
people who were putting these things out

209
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:59,210
there and they just it was really good

210
00:09:59,210 --> 00:10:00,710
and they just turned out to be ordinary

211
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:02,390
Irish guys you could sit and have a chat

212
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:03,530
except instead of chatting about

213
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:05,150
football or whatever you were able to

214
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:06,770
talk about whether he used imagemagick

215
00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:09,530
to do browser based image compare that

216
00:10:09,530 --> 00:10:11,000
it was just it was brilliant the other

217
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,320
thing I learned to us on nobody really

218
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,140
owns a community and you know the were

219
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:16,430
people telling him that he couldn't do

220
00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:18,290
it because they owned the community you

221
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:20,380
know that's just so so

222
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:23,180
bright-eyed bushy-tailed Paul an emo

223
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:25,160
very valuable lesson Jesus that's a

224
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:27,320
great one and to some of the first

225
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:30,400
chapter a quote from Jeremy asking us

226
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:36,710
from last year so chapter two and yeah

227
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:40,640
so um we had a from our point of view we

228
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,350
were we were looking at that the

229
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:43,550
activity that was happening over in

230
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:45,170
Silicon Valley and other parts of the

231
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:48,080
world a lot of activity around startups

232
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,570
around developers in startups round open

233
00:10:50,570 --> 00:10:53,150
source a lot of real world communities

234
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:54,890
coming together that may have met online

235
00:10:54,890 --> 00:10:57,380
in some way and we didn't we didn't

236
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:59,090
really experience much of that in Dublin

237
00:10:59,090 --> 00:11:01,010
until this this point and and we were

238
00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:02,960
envious about what else was going on in

239
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:03,920
another part of the world and so we

240
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,650
wanted to create a bit of that on our

241
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:08,270
own you gotta understand about Ireland

242
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:10,130
is that it's it's you know it's four and

243
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:12,260
a half million people it's it's it's an

244
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:13,850
island and there's a mentality that

245
00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:15,920
comes with that and wherever you guys

246
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,030
are from maybe you've experienced a

247
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:18,230
degree that but you know when you're

248
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:21,170
live in a small population it's it's

249
00:11:21,170 --> 00:11:23,120
very easy for to be told you can't do

250
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,860
stuffins very easy to think that and

251
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:26,900
well why would we bother going abroad or

252
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:28,220
to other countries when we have

253
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:29,810
everything we need here which is you

254
00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:31,310
know it's it's totally at all so what

255
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:33,350
what what communities international

256
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:34,610
communities or better water for open

257
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:37,490
source community service and your neck

258
00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:39,650
sir and yeah so our perspective was

259
00:11:39,650 --> 00:11:42,080
local versus global and we want it to be

260
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,820
among the best or what we thought was

261
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:46,700
the best and our perspective was limited

262
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:48,440
to the people we interacted with on on

263
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,270
Twitter and so I guess what I'm saying

264
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:52,640
is that we had a motivation to go beyond

265
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,380
Ireland and that was actually half the

266
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,150
battle arena and then during this time

267
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:59,120
we in our notes for preparing we refer

268
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,970
to this period as the trough of despair

269
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:03,650
because we were putting all this effort

270
00:12:03,650 --> 00:12:05,270
and money and time into trying to build

271
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:07,130
little companies and things and stuff

272
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:08,900
didn't really work out that well oh we

273
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:10,280
were trying to figure it out but in a

274
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,870
trial and error but we we just kept that

275
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:14,360
he always had time for points are we

276
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:16,300
were still bright eyed and bushy guess

277
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:20,780
and to some of this chapter was the

278
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:24,860
whole package old Irish proverb it's

279
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:26,060
sure to be grand Paul has a different

280
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:27,920
perspective on this and I do yeah so the

281
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:28,910
interesting thing about this phrase is

282
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:30,440
that everywhere else in the world the

283
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:32,570
world grand means doing things on a big

284
00:12:32,570 --> 00:12:34,940
scale with massive production values in

285
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:37,790
Ireland sure grand means Asher just just

286
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:39,170
run it without test their every grant

287
00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:41,180
you know with me good good good enough

288
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:43,190
is good enough yeah yeah so we just

289
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:45,740
wanted we wanted to sort of take it to

290
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:47,000
the locals and say that we wanted to

291
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,210
compete on an international scale yeah

292
00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:54,410
which takes us to chapter 3 gluttony it

293
00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:57,980
takes back to this fine city from four

294
00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:00,740
years ago known almost I'm we came to

295
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:02,420
Jay a scarf for the first time I think

296
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:03,620
was the first conference that we had

297
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:07,700
traveled to together and it was it was a

298
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:10,820
life-changing experience and yeah that

299
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:12,230
sounds really douchey to say but

300
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:14,330
actually was seriously though I mean I

301
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:16,550
hope that some of you if you've come

302
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:18,770
here for the first time and would agree

303
00:13:18,770 --> 00:13:22,760
that it's hard to distill just why it is

304
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,920
I mean maybe it's the talks and maybe

305
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:26,270
it's the talks that you don't understand

306
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:27,620
but you know you hope that you'll

307
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:29,480
understand next year maybe it's the

308
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:34,190
parties but it really comes down to one

309
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:39,830
thing I think I understood it most after

310
00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:41,390
the talks when I kind of assimilated

311
00:13:41,390 --> 00:13:43,280
everything and I put out a tweet saying

312
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,920
hey I'm organizing a dinner I think I

313
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,210
said I was organizing on Ruby dinner

314
00:13:47,210 --> 00:13:50,600
because but a few people came and I just

315
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,220
learned this thing that all of these

316
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:53,720
people these heroes the people that I

317
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:54,769
revere

318
00:13:54,769 --> 00:13:57,769
as celebrities they watched breaking bad

319
00:13:57,769 --> 00:14:00,949
too and you know what i mean is like it

320
00:14:00,949 --> 00:14:03,980
was just it was just i felt like i was i

321
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:05,420
was part of a family and where i was

322
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:07,309
able to talk to talk to these people let

323
00:14:07,309 --> 00:14:08,749
Allah or let alone be in the same room

324
00:14:08,749 --> 00:14:12,829
with them and it really was just those

325
00:14:12,829 --> 00:14:14,299
are really important lesson oh my god

326
00:14:14,299 --> 00:14:15,679
because it's it's so hard when you're

327
00:14:15,679 --> 00:14:17,689
removed and you're from various

328
00:14:17,689 --> 00:14:18,799
communities and you're watching from

329
00:14:18,799 --> 00:14:20,869
afar and you hear enough people being

330
00:14:20,869 --> 00:14:22,429
spoken about on twitter or mentioned

331
00:14:22,429 --> 00:14:24,230
done conferences or whatever it's very

332
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:25,939
easy for the thing that they're they're

333
00:14:25,939 --> 00:14:27,559
big shots when really it or not they you

334
00:14:27,559 --> 00:14:29,119
know yeah they ship the same color you

335
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:33,529
do so at that conference i really need

336
00:14:33,529 --> 00:14:36,619
to think about things before saturday at

337
00:14:36,619 --> 00:14:40,579
that conference um Yan said to us of the

338
00:14:40,579 --> 00:14:42,019
on the last night that there was a few

339
00:14:42,019 --> 00:14:43,399
people getting coming to tan from github

340
00:14:43,399 --> 00:14:46,549
and that Yan had just spent five days on

341
00:14:46,549 --> 00:14:48,110
his feet he needed to go to bed but he

342
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:49,519
needed people to entertain the gate up

343
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:50,899
guys because he wanted to impress them

344
00:14:50,899 --> 00:14:53,679
so we turned to a bunch of nobody Irish

345
00:14:53,679 --> 00:14:56,929
mocha whatever I'm hilarious I don't

346
00:14:56,929 --> 00:15:00,529
remember it like that so anyway so we

347
00:15:00,529 --> 00:15:02,089
ended up I with the gate up guys and

348
00:15:02,089 --> 00:15:04,100
which was amazing here's a shot of from

349
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:07,749
7am hover after having not finished um

350
00:15:07,749 --> 00:15:10,420
here's proof that we were actually there

351
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:15,110
um and

352
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:19,660
and one of the the phrases that came out

353
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:21,040
last night as we were learning that

354
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,630
these guys were just people and that we

355
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:24,220
could actually talk to them and interact

356
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:28,510
with them was this this lovely request

357
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:31,209
that Scott from github said to me and it

358
00:15:31,209 --> 00:15:33,870
was just I'd love to come to a fun

359
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:40,180
conference in Ireland so that night that

360
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:42,850
night something changed and the seeds

361
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:46,600
were sown so the next chapter then that

362
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:47,949
moves go straight into the next chapter

363
00:15:47,949 --> 00:15:50,829
which is lost and it basically started

364
00:15:50,829 --> 00:15:52,959
in a room that following january i guess

365
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:56,769
and where you going with this well this

366
00:15:56,769 --> 00:15:59,910
is the inception of different so

367
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:03,639
it was an aim was office and we were

368
00:16:03,639 --> 00:16:05,380
talking we were talking and trying to

369
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:06,760
figure out what we didn't we scheduled

370
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:09,130
flunk out for april yeah yeah

371
00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:13,029
twenty-fourth of a pro 2010 24 okay and

372
00:16:13,029 --> 00:16:15,070
so it takes us right up so we said we'd

373
00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:16,779
do it we planned it we put tweet satan

374
00:16:16,779 --> 00:16:18,850
and people bought tickets actually and

375
00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:23,470
yeah and it this is you this is me

376
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:26,380
alright Jay my name is Ray hey so yeah I

377
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:28,839
mean we'd never organized a conference

378
00:16:28,839 --> 00:16:30,940
before the only real good example of a

379
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:32,529
conference we'd ever seen was Jay's conf

380
00:16:32,529 --> 00:16:34,300
I was blown away by the fact that I

381
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:36,279
turned up to Jay's campana on a Friday

382
00:16:36,279 --> 00:16:38,740
and went home on a on a Sunday and I

383
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:39,820
didn't have to put my hand on my pocket

384
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:41,800
for the whole weekend and thought

385
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:45,190
everything I needed was here and I've

386
00:16:45,190 --> 00:16:46,630
been to a few conferences for but I

387
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:50,290
don't blew me away and the gen genuine

388
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:52,510
nature of people just willing to connect

389
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:54,790
and we be friends you know to form new

390
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:56,560
friendships I'd never experienced at

391
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:59,319
conferences before the fact that this

392
00:16:59,319 --> 00:17:02,199
circle table seating arrangement that

393
00:17:02,199 --> 00:17:03,220
you're sitting out right now it was

394
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:04,480
there at the very first one has been a

395
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,520
consistent team through the whole way

396
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:10,089
through and it's communal I mean you're

397
00:17:10,089 --> 00:17:11,919
you may be facing this way but your son

398
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:13,839
at the same table you're not kind of

399
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:15,220
shoulder to shoulder with somebody or

400
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:16,569
looking at the back of somebody okay

401
00:17:16,569 --> 00:17:17,319
you're looking at the back of somebody's

402
00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:20,709
head but and the point is that it's is

403
00:17:20,709 --> 00:17:22,660
this is a scenario that's more open to

404
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:24,579
having a genuine conversation and maybe

405
00:17:24,579 --> 00:17:26,350
making friends and when you make friends

406
00:17:26,350 --> 00:17:27,370
in the industry you never know we're not

407
00:17:27,370 --> 00:17:27,750
go

408
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:33,340
so we were driving down to the idea was

409
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:35,740
to put fun kind of on a boss and that we

410
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:37,630
do a tour of ireland while listening to

411
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:39,850
people tell stories dokas ages to get on

412
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:41,440
that idea we were gonna do the

413
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,210
traditional kind of venue and just Paul

414
00:17:43,210 --> 00:17:45,100
was being whining about it and he said

415
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:47,049
we can't do that and I'm glad he was

416
00:17:47,049 --> 00:17:49,240
pushing banish yeah we do something

417
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:51,130
different yeah so anyways Tuesday in the

418
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:52,330
conference is starting on friday we're

419
00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:53,950
like really excited because it's gonna

420
00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:55,660
be it's gotta be funk off like it's

421
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:58,809
gonna be a good time so next thing we're

422
00:17:58,809 --> 00:18:00,580
we're which I'm then on the radio it's

423
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:03,669
like a up here you told the icelandic

424
00:18:03,669 --> 00:18:06,580
volcano has erupted where there there

425
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:09,520
may be interference with flights where

426
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,380
there may be means every single flight

427
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:13,059
in the entire sky over Europe has been

428
00:18:13,059 --> 00:18:16,330
created and nobody can fly to Ireland I

429
00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:19,030
my response was I sure it'll be

430
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:21,970
grand so hey Rose says he's like I

431
00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:24,280
wouldn't it be funny if people couldn't

432
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,809
fly to get in the front of one cough and

433
00:18:25,809 --> 00:18:28,030
I'm said I had to be terrible yeah so

434
00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:30,730
that night we decided to postpone the

435
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:34,150
event like three days before and we

436
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:36,940
didn't know what to do and the one thing

437
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:39,790
we didn't do was we didn't panic like we

438
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:41,770
didn't go oh my god this is gonna be the

439
00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:43,600
worst thing ever it's a complete failure

440
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,820
we've just this thing is just we're

441
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:48,790
doomed we a few people emailed us and

442
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:50,080
said they were gonna come anyway we were

443
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,690
like whoa she better do something this

444
00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:53,919
is why i think what i said earlier on a

445
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:55,150
bed we have different perspectives on

446
00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:56,500
our phrase shirt pocket it'll be grand

447
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,330
as done he gave his perspective but

448
00:18:58,330 --> 00:19:00,250
another way of looking at it is if you

449
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:02,320
know remain positive and and don't worry

450
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,030
too much sometimes she just worked

451
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:06,309
itself out so just like Anton had done

452
00:19:06,309 --> 00:19:08,860
in January we we booked a room yeah we

453
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:11,110
put a bit of our budget to put on the

454
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:13,630
bar and some of the speakers they flew

455
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:15,790
in and they came and gave these ad hoc

456
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:18,010
talks and I think there was about 70

457
00:19:18,010 --> 00:19:19,780
people just showed up and had a good

458
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:23,020
time we completely put the cold

459
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:25,030
conference back six months we didn't

460
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:26,260
have to issue i think we issued one

461
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:28,059
refund because the disc edgell didn't

462
00:19:28,059 --> 00:19:30,429
work all of the speakers bar one were

463
00:19:30,429 --> 00:19:32,830
able to reschedule and it was just not

464
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:36,130
it was like I mean this is what we were

465
00:19:36,130 --> 00:19:41,900
faced with

466
00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:45,610
who does that happen to and this is what

467
00:19:45,610 --> 00:19:48,040
we got we got it wasn't a conference it

468
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:50,200
was doesn't I know it looks like seven

469
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:53,950
people there but there was actually more

470
00:19:53,950 --> 00:19:56,260
people behind the photographer and that

471
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:58,570
is a cage that we're standing on so it

472
00:19:58,570 --> 00:20:00,820
definitely was a true case of like it

473
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:02,140
could have been a complete and utter

474
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:04,450
disaster but unfun cough kind of put us

475
00:20:04,450 --> 00:20:06,370
on the rail and said okay even though it

476
00:20:06,370 --> 00:20:08,680
wasn't what we had planned that this was

477
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:10,480
really good we wish let's go ahead and

478
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,550
do it in September yeah and that takes

479
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:15,520
us to chapter five slow so we didn't

480
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,170
actually do any more organization just

481
00:20:17,170 --> 00:20:19,420
to all the organization trike I tell ya

482
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:20,890
that the t-shirts were already printed

483
00:20:20,890 --> 00:20:22,570
the venues were all booked they just to

484
00:20:22,570 --> 00:20:23,800
change the bookings the deposits were

485
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,840
paid I was kind of a relaxing couple of

486
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:26,760
months while we just waited for

487
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:29,050
September to come up to after April and

488
00:20:29,050 --> 00:20:32,980
it was it was just it was crazy so it

489
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:34,480
takes us to September from from two

490
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,340
years ago and then this was the first

491
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:38,680
fun cough and it was a conference on a

492
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:42,580
bus but the really interesting thing for

493
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:47,320
me about fun conf was that a lot of what

494
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:48,730
we did was on waiting we just kind of

495
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:50,320
wanted to play with the idea of a

496
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,810
conference and we put people all

497
00:20:52,810 --> 00:20:54,310
together for breakfast in a restaurant

498
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:56,110
and then we put them all on buses

499
00:20:56,110 --> 00:20:58,240
together for speakers and attendees all

500
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,390
together in the buses in the morning we

501
00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:02,710
had an after party which was a very

502
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:06,400
enclosed self-contained area and it sort

503
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:09,190
of it it gave this sat up where there

504
00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:11,590
was no fractioning or there was no

505
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:12,970
distribution everybody was kind of all

506
00:21:12,970 --> 00:21:15,010
together at the same time and and it

507
00:21:15,010 --> 00:21:16,330
created an interest in scenario where

508
00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:18,100
people will be sitting on the bus beside

509
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:20,230
the CTO of Amazon not realized who he is

510
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:21,880
and then he you know gets up and gives a

511
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,980
talk and it's like well then then later

512
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:26,230
they'd be like that guy knew a lot about

513
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:32,620
AWS for it for an old dude it just it

514
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:34,780
was just so I mean it was fun like to do

515
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:36,400
that to kind of from master by with

516
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,890
people and and so the idea was I called

517
00:21:38,890 --> 00:21:42,040
it the trap it was we were trapping

518
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:45,760
people in this limousine party bus to

519
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,260
them actually and so even though people

520
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:49,270
were trapped it was quite good fun it

521
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:50,560
was yeah it was kind of flashing lights

522
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:51,910
to his music there was a microphone

523
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:52,690
people

524
00:21:52,690 --> 00:21:55,210
and we put did a great thing that it was

525
00:21:55,210 --> 00:21:56,950
there was no presentation so no actual

526
00:21:56,950 --> 00:21:59,260
screen rant and so people had to rethink

527
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:01,360
how they actually conveyed ideas so

528
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,920
didn't have the benefit of a big screen

529
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:05,380
and laptops so we we encourage people to

530
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:07,000
think about it more like telling a story

531
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,030
rather than giving a presentation and so

532
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:11,560
not only added to the informal

533
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:14,770
atmosphere so we put on good food that

534
00:22:14,770 --> 00:22:16,720
was important trap people with drinks on

535
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,700
the buses there's people kind of

536
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:20,290
enjoying themselves this was the bar

537
00:22:20,290 --> 00:22:22,510
that I described this was the lunch I'm

538
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:24,640
and that was us I'm doing the first one

539
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,230
as you can probably tell i mean we it

540
00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:28,720
still does have an air of like you'd

541
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,040
notice was our first conference because

542
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:31,960
we were really there was a degree of

543
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:34,240
flying by the seat of my pants but the

544
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,970
idea of kind of just shaking up and

545
00:22:36,970 --> 00:22:38,380
not doing things ordinarily like that

546
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:40,570
was really really infectious and this is

547
00:22:40,570 --> 00:22:42,040
a lovely quote that that happened

548
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:43,660
afterwards and well this was the

549
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:45,460
following you but it all came down to

550
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:46,840
that it all came just put give people

551
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:49,060
something to talk about and maybe we

552
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:51,730
could make it work so flying into the

553
00:22:51,730 --> 00:22:55,990
next chapter greed um yeah so just

554
00:22:55,990 --> 00:23:01,150
brings us to sep tember 2011 and phone

555
00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:03,520
come to we've taken some of the lessons

556
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:06,640
that we learned and we'd picked up a

557
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:09,090
couple of other things along the way and

558
00:23:09,090 --> 00:23:12,190
we really wanted to kind of one of the

559
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:13,720
things that I taught phone cam phone

560
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:16,210
went went pretty well one person came up

561
00:23:16,210 --> 00:23:17,680
to me at the end of the night and said I

562
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:18,940
was great what are you going to do next

563
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:20,800
year and I'd already in my head saying

564
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,120
we could just do the same thing every

565
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:23,740
year and you know people love it but

566
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:25,240
because you know there was an

567
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,380
expectation in that we need to do

568
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:29,200
something bigger and better it was like

569
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,060
well what do we do that's bigger and

570
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:33,670
better I remember the I was in the the

571
00:23:33,670 --> 00:23:35,500
pre-party I think for again Jay a scarf

572
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:38,230
and I think we had just done fun cuff

573
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:40,450
yeah and it was the free party and I was

574
00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:43,000
kind of high on being in Berlin and

575
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,320
meeting all the people that we've met

576
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,550
before the previous year and having

577
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:47,500
since done something I was saying if you

578
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:49,990
all wouldn't have amazing to put it in a

579
00:23:49,990 --> 00:23:52,480
castle and peaceful the look I would get

580
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:56,519
would just be yes

581
00:23:56,519 --> 00:23:59,320
it was great it was like as they parse

582
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:01,809
the idea of being in a castle in the

583
00:24:01,809 --> 00:24:03,309
sides of Ireland and then the

584
00:24:03,309 --> 00:24:04,989
realization that maybe it would happen

585
00:24:04,989 --> 00:24:06,820
like if we can do it in a bus we could

586
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:09,279
do an apostle and we did and we went on

587
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:10,779
didn't Castle show photos in a second

588
00:24:10,779 --> 00:24:13,119
and what we really learned is one it can

589
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:15,369
be done um and there is I did not know

590
00:24:15,369 --> 00:24:18,820
you could rent a castle frantic so I

591
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:20,169
went and organized the castle while

592
00:24:20,169 --> 00:24:22,749
amons company got acquired and he got

593
00:24:22,749 --> 00:24:26,970
married and I'm oh yeah thanks for

594
00:24:26,970 --> 00:24:29,529
covering my back their paltry Shannon am

595
00:24:29,529 --> 00:24:31,840
and so we put it on and but the thing is

596
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:34,269
the week before the conference Eamon

597
00:24:34,269 --> 00:24:37,690
came to me with this idea yeah I I don't

598
00:24:37,690 --> 00:24:40,179
know I just subconsciously I thought it

599
00:24:40,179 --> 00:24:42,070
would be great to have juxtaposition of

600
00:24:42,070 --> 00:24:43,720
a DeLorean and a castle with a clan and

601
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:45,970
a donkey and I wanted a stuffed badger

602
00:24:45,970 --> 00:24:48,580
and no lady smoking a pipe in a deck

603
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:49,509
chair but I couldn't get one of those

604
00:24:49,509 --> 00:24:51,340
but the guy who got the donkey from me

605
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:52,450
rang me and he said hey do you want a

606
00:24:52,450 --> 00:24:54,129
llama as well I said what really

607
00:24:54,129 --> 00:24:56,139
you got a llama yeah totally for the

608
00:24:56,139 --> 00:24:58,989
same price yeah if you think they do it

609
00:24:58,989 --> 00:25:00,309
if you've ever seen a bunch of

610
00:25:00,309 --> 00:25:03,009
JavaScript does that developers chasing

611
00:25:03,009 --> 00:25:04,720
a llama down an Avenue so that it

612
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,070
doesn't escape into the dilemma right

613
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:07,809
away it was nearly blood on the streets

614
00:25:07,809 --> 00:25:09,999
it was it was wasn't being cooperative

615
00:25:09,999 --> 00:25:12,309
the donkey was a stubborn ass uh-huh the

616
00:25:12,309 --> 00:25:14,559
question the back of my rational mind is

617
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:18,580
why why not and then the excitement was

618
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:22,109
that is going to happen next week

619
00:25:22,109 --> 00:25:24,299
annotated it was great was good fun and

620
00:25:24,299 --> 00:25:27,070
the idea about pro meaning production

621
00:25:27,070 --> 00:25:28,809
and we see it here all arenas like the

622
00:25:28,809 --> 00:25:30,549
production values here are incredible is

623
00:25:30,549 --> 00:25:32,590
it fun comp is not a professional

624
00:25:32,590 --> 00:25:34,479
conference by any means it includes a

625
00:25:34,479 --> 00:25:36,279
lot of very professional people and

626
00:25:36,279 --> 00:25:38,799
profession PA but what we learned by

627
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:40,749
kind of asking the right people and as

628
00:25:40,749 --> 00:25:42,489
it happened the people in the castle

629
00:25:42,489 --> 00:25:44,289
works like they were they were royalty

630
00:25:44,289 --> 00:25:47,440
level professional and so the production

631
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,690
value there was amazing the food was

632
00:25:49,690 --> 00:25:51,369
incredible the setting was on the screen

633
00:25:51,369 --> 00:25:52,840
actually took a lot of burden office you

634
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:54,070
know there's a lot of different scenes

635
00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:56,499
people were come when we realized that

636
00:25:56,499 --> 00:25:58,720
you could put a gig in a dining hall in

637
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,909
a castle and have the most amazing sand

638
00:26:00,909 --> 00:26:03,970
and the moat it was like okay this is we

639
00:26:03,970 --> 00:26:05,710
can actually achieve this and that's Oh

640
00:26:05,710 --> 00:26:08,570
next one look sorry yeah okay

641
00:26:08,570 --> 00:26:11,120
I'm one that's the castle it was just

642
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:14,899
like wow cool I'm and then leaving this

643
00:26:14,899 --> 00:26:17,539
chapter funk off to a quote from one of

644
00:26:17,539 --> 00:26:20,870
my favorite people in the world so it

645
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:22,340
was the idea that it didn't have to be

646
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:26,059
 just reinforced and again bring

647
00:26:26,059 --> 00:26:28,279
just reinforced and again bring
people to this great venue and just do

648
00:26:28,279 --> 00:26:29,960
 make it really comes into the

649
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:31,130
make it really comes into the
motivation and this is a big difference

650
00:26:31,130 --> 00:26:32,840
between community organized events and

651
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:35,870
say professionally designed and curate

652
00:26:35,870 --> 00:26:38,149
events by you know official event

653
00:26:38,149 --> 00:26:40,039
companies is the motivation behind it is

654
00:26:40,039 --> 00:26:42,110
is completely different and I guess

655
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:43,879
greed is there in both cases so the last

656
00:26:43,879 --> 00:26:45,860
chapter was greed and we wanted we were

657
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:47,240
greedy because we wanted to bring people

658
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:48,919
together and build a conference for

659
00:26:48,919 --> 00:26:50,360
ourselves right who do we want to see

660
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:51,409
talk who do you want to hang out with

661
00:26:51,409 --> 00:26:52,820
right so there's a self interest in

662
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:55,539
there where is professional event and

663
00:26:55,539 --> 00:26:58,250
conference organizing companies are in

664
00:26:58,250 --> 00:27:01,190
it for the money and so really those

665
00:27:01,190 --> 00:27:03,169
those two motivations are different than

666
00:27:03,169 --> 00:27:04,940
it really shows in the outcome and this

667
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:06,740
is I doing the reasons why I've always

668
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:10,190
thought Jay his comp was that and really

669
00:27:10,190 --> 00:27:12,350
a top of its game when it comes to

670
00:27:12,350 --> 00:27:13,759
conferences that the motivation behind

671
00:27:13,759 --> 00:27:15,139
this is one thing and one thing only

672
00:27:15,139 --> 00:27:18,799
community people and that's why it's

673
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:21,019
awesome okay go next route the final

674
00:27:21,019 --> 00:27:24,950
chapter tiger ha so it's takes us back

675
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:27,289
to the last month or yes two months ago

676
00:27:27,289 --> 00:27:32,360
night funk alpha 3 and we had said a few

677
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:34,340
times well there was a few things that

678
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:36,289
had been said but one of them was we

679
00:27:36,289 --> 00:27:40,190
should keep it to three um why no real

680
00:27:40,190 --> 00:27:41,720
reason it just kind of felt right and

681
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:43,759
but the other reason was that people had

682
00:27:43,759 --> 00:27:44,899
said the first time how do you top a

683
00:27:44,899 --> 00:27:47,929
boss I was like well easy a castle they

684
00:27:47,929 --> 00:27:50,200
had your dava castle and I said well

685
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:52,850
people didn't leave but I had been

686
00:27:52,850 --> 00:27:54,559
pitching this idea that maybe we could

687
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:56,000
have a bunch of people just like this

688
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,889
having lunch round tables and as they

689
00:27:57,889 --> 00:28:00,019
were sitting there they would see

690
00:28:00,019 --> 00:28:02,000
helicopters descending yeah and then

691
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,590
they would say well cool helicopters and

692
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:05,179
then they would say now you can get into

693
00:28:05,179 --> 00:28:06,440
the helicopters were going on a journey

694
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:08,480
together I didn't think it was possible

695
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,789
I did not know you could hire a fleet

696
00:28:10,789 --> 00:28:13,280
Ali grabbed one just last day

697
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:15,110
well it turns out that you can actually

698
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:19,540
hire helicopters and again why not so

699
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:22,460
for fun count of three we we wanted to

700
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:23,660
go all out we wanted to go out with a

701
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:25,700
band we wanted to go absolutely nuts and

702
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:27,350
I wanted to do the helicopter idea so

703
00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:31,460
damn bad and the Helena call the

704
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:33,440
helicopter call was in fact there was a

705
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:35,240
point where there was a point where we

706
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:38,600
reckon that if if it would just cost too

707
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:41,510
much to do it but we we stayed true to

708
00:28:41,510 --> 00:28:43,040
it and like it would not be the same

709
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:44,720
whatever the hell you got short-selling

710
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,460
update the thinking the thinking of

711
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:48,530
anybody coming along so fun craft would

712
00:28:48,530 --> 00:28:52,610
be 999 euros yeah am I thinking was I

713
00:28:52,610 --> 00:28:54,230
want to do helicopters I don't care what

714
00:28:54,230 --> 00:28:55,940
it costs out you don't want it if

715
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:57,380
people want to trust me to do this then

716
00:28:57,380 --> 00:28:59,630
yeah well I'm not that Sean true in the

717
00:28:59,630 --> 00:29:01,160
end the website no funny you guys saw

718
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:03,560
the website was just a picture of an

719
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:05,240
island with the question do you trust us

720
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:07,430
yes or no there was no schedule or

721
00:29:07,430 --> 00:29:10,760
speakers or you know anythin that was it

722
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:12,980
and when you hit yes you got asked to

723
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:17,780
pay des neuro and well we we were

724
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:20,510
successful in selling it and creating a

725
00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:21,650
big enough budget where we could afford

726
00:29:21,650 --> 00:29:23,120
helicopters and then just another quick

727
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,230
thing to say is that we didn't actually

728
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:26,450
make any money we don't we paid for our

729
00:29:26,450 --> 00:29:28,130
own plenty of tickets yeah and they

730
00:29:28,130 --> 00:29:33,650
weren't cheap so the last thing that we

731
00:29:33,650 --> 00:29:35,000
learned from doing that is that like we

732
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,190
did want to go out with a bang um and

733
00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:38,870
here's a few highlights from funk of

734
00:29:38,870 --> 00:29:40,850
three these were the this was the name

735
00:29:40,850 --> 00:29:42,980
badge like that the we double as a

736
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:45,500
drinks holder we also kind of decided a

737
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:47,600
few months beforehand up we're going to

738
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:48,950
grow at our beers actually Paul decide

739
00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:50,420
about two months ahead of me didn't tell

740
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:52,160
me suita head start so his beard is way

741
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:54,470
more impressive than mine still not as

742
00:29:54,470 --> 00:29:55,970
awesome as yours don't like we did the

743
00:29:55,970 --> 00:29:57,770
helicopter thing but the phone call was

744
00:29:57,770 --> 00:30:01,430
funny it was how's it going there I see

745
00:30:01,430 --> 00:30:03,500
you have a helicopter company and would

746
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:05,120
you be able to bring a hundred nerds to

747
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:07,040
an island next September and you're mine

748
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:10,730
was like yeah no problem I didn't know

749
00:30:10,730 --> 00:30:12,140
it did that ease into her later

750
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:15,170
helicopters and the stage setup we was

751
00:30:15,170 --> 00:30:16,970
with lots of balloons and things with

752
00:30:16,970 --> 00:30:18,290
the great thing about a couple of people

753
00:30:18,290 --> 00:30:19,670
brought their kids you can see and

754
00:30:19,670 --> 00:30:22,040
there's lets jaxon younger those photos

755
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:23,870
yeah young ridley there is being handed

756
00:30:23,870 --> 00:30:25,650
to his dad Sean

757
00:30:25,650 --> 00:30:27,630
from the helicopter and then that's Tom

758
00:30:27,630 --> 00:30:30,270
presser Warner from github he gave his

759
00:30:30,270 --> 00:30:32,700
talk with his baby strapped it to his

760
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:34,680
chest baby didn't wake up at all amazing

761
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:37,380
the cool kid and then just like why not

762
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:39,150
have a conference in a castle why not

763
00:30:39,150 --> 00:30:40,230
have a conference and have loads of

764
00:30:40,230 --> 00:30:43,620
clips yeah we didn't get the really we

765
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:44,930
didn't really get the winner that day

766
00:30:44,930 --> 00:30:50,130
but I was like cool um and the idea was

767
00:30:50,130 --> 00:30:52,920
as well at making it the last conference

768
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:54,900
making it the last one it kind of made

769
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:56,490
it that bit more special all right i was

770
00:30:56,490 --> 00:30:58,500
a bit sentimental in it lots of people

771
00:30:58,500 --> 00:30:59,820
have said all they'll read don't want to

772
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:01,830
go next year and I'm like no you won't

773
00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:04,230
it's sorry you missed that chance the

774
00:31:04,230 --> 00:31:06,360
ship or the train has passed or whatever

775
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:08,040
a helicopter has helicopter has landed

776
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:10,590
yeah um and it was it was just really

777
00:31:10,590 --> 00:31:13,350
really special to to sit and know that

778
00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:14,730
we didn't have to do it again and that

779
00:31:14,730 --> 00:31:16,500
this was the last one we really put our

780
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:18,660
absolute awe like it literally if we

781
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:20,550
could have translated our personalities

782
00:31:20,550 --> 00:31:21,720
into a conference it would have been fun

783
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:22,980
come through he couldn't have done any

784
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:24,450
more like there was there was no

785
00:31:24,450 --> 00:31:26,070
resources available to us I've no

786
00:31:26,070 --> 00:31:27,840
regrets i'm happy absolutely and this

787
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:30,660
was this was all singing i think yeah to

788
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:33,180
the lads at about it was great um

789
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:35,910
so this is the philosophy we prefer to

790
00:31:35,910 --> 00:31:37,880
be back to the future din star wars um

791
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:45,510
go go in how are we on time don't great

792
00:31:45,510 --> 00:31:49,440
two minutes ok cool so to sum up the the

793
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:52,440
final chapter is this amazing quote and

794
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:54,870
I'll read it it's what we think or what

795
00:31:54,870 --> 00:31:57,360
we know or what we believe is in the end

796
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,940
of little consequence the only

797
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:03,840
consequence is what we do so to sum up

798
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,880
we didn't need permission to do anything

799
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,500
is we didn't ask from issuing like we

800
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:09,930
just said let's go do this and we wanted

801
00:32:09,930 --> 00:32:11,490
to be amongst the best in the world and

802
00:32:11,490 --> 00:32:13,320
we fought too and like we didn't have

803
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:16,230
any right to be but we just went did it

804
00:32:16,230 --> 00:32:18,360
I'm we weren't netten discovered that if

805
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:20,190
you ask people things and they usually

806
00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:22,530
respond and it was nice oh it wasn't

807
00:32:22,530 --> 00:32:24,330
that if we asked people it was just they

808
00:32:24,330 --> 00:32:25,680
did respond to me I couldn't believe

809
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:29,730
like yeah um we didn't panic I should be

810
00:32:29,730 --> 00:32:32,520
granted we just put people in a box and

811
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:34,740
hope that by bringing good people

812
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:37,200
together that it would work and it turns

813
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,899
out that it did work really well for us

814
00:32:39,899 --> 00:32:43,270
what so you lock the exits so no one can

815
00:32:43,270 --> 00:32:45,570
leave that's a that's a great one and

816
00:32:45,570 --> 00:32:47,799
pro means production I think another

817
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:50,200
thing about that is that you don't have

818
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:52,149
to be in any way professional to have

819
00:32:52,149 --> 00:32:53,770
high production values I think that's

820
00:32:53,770 --> 00:32:56,289
the key there I'd professional has

821
00:32:56,289 --> 00:32:59,110
become used and abused sure but like we

822
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:00,490
didn't have to be in any way a

823
00:33:00,490 --> 00:33:02,940
professional to do and it was great ah

824
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:06,669
so are happy to finish so that's pretty

825
00:33:06,669 --> 00:33:08,789
much the end but there's one more thing

826
00:33:08,789 --> 00:33:12,130
so no I started a tradition i think that

827
00:33:12,130 --> 00:33:14,470
the pride of it i started this yessir

828
00:33:14,470 --> 00:33:16,659
i'm the first funcom I we were at a bar

829
00:33:16,659 --> 00:33:19,000
and I went to the bar man he was an old

830
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,480
german dude and I said can still taking

831
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:24,399
this to the next in labor or the next

832
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:26,980
day I wanted to get to the next level

833
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:29,260
and he he again it was that look of

834
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:34,330
parsing no no no it was the old guy it

835
00:33:34,330 --> 00:33:35,830
was I said it to the old guy he was very

836
00:33:35,830 --> 00:33:38,140
old and again it was his famous it's

837
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:39,730
amazing away booze you know just

838
00:33:39,730 --> 00:33:41,679
transforms your memories face his face

839
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:43,210
went quiet as he was parsing what the

840
00:33:43,210 --> 00:33:46,720
next level might be and then he went ok

841
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,730
and he leaned under the day at the table

842
00:33:48,730 --> 00:33:51,549
they pulled out this box and the box was

843
00:33:51,549 --> 00:33:53,740
kumily come rolling is some Canadian

844
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:55,059
show of hands anybody ever had come

845
00:33:55,059 --> 00:33:57,669
reeling before alright so crumbling is

846
00:33:57,669 --> 00:34:00,130
this weird cross of Jagermeister and sis

847
00:34:00,130 --> 00:34:03,010
custom cough syrup and discos acid

848
00:34:03,010 --> 00:34:06,760
assess Coulson so I led the charge for

849
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:07,870
the first one there was a local guy

850
00:34:07,870 --> 00:34:09,669
there and said that you cannot buy one

851
00:34:09,669 --> 00:34:11,290
crumbling he was actually the dude who

852
00:34:11,290 --> 00:34:12,879
was asleep in that photograph earlier on

853
00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:14,679
in the presentation you think I we had

854
00:34:14,679 --> 00:34:16,599
his head down here so he says you know I

855
00:34:16,599 --> 00:34:18,580
have one without yet completing the coma

856
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:22,030
link circle so yeah so 2009 we manage I

857
00:34:22,030 --> 00:34:23,560
came to these we managed to do 50 and

858
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:26,440
there was barely about 10 was there 2010

859
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:28,389
you know difficult second album really

860
00:34:28,389 --> 00:34:30,790
was you know we didn't maintain that

861
00:34:30,790 --> 00:34:31,960
record and there was less was there as

862
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:33,399
well I just want to say I thought that

863
00:34:33,399 --> 00:34:35,830
was enough I don't condone the

864
00:34:35,830 --> 00:34:37,720
continuation of this tradition I think

865
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:40,060
that has already jumped the shark so I

866
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:42,609
want to I want to talk about projected

867
00:34:42,609 --> 00:34:46,000
growth this year it's clear data you

868
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,679
know phone come visit the only

869
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:48,970
partnership that has been abundant

870
00:34:48,970 --> 00:34:50,830
between the two of us he's he's laid his

871
00:34:50,830 --> 00:34:52,089
cards on the table he doesn't want to be

872
00:34:52,089 --> 00:34:52,530
part

873
00:34:52,530 --> 00:34:54,179
tradition anymore I had a to the

874
00:34:54,179 --> 00:34:58,230
things last year really yeah Wow right

875
00:34:58,230 --> 00:35:02,820
too um so anyway look if that's he's

876
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:04,380
just it's just one more thing so that's

877
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:06,720
Sam that's pretty much it and this was

878
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:13,050
in no way photo shopped at all so to sum

879
00:35:13,050 --> 00:35:17,270
up that was just that we've done um

880
00:35:17,270 --> 00:35:20,060
we've learned a fair bit about it but it

881
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:22,860
doesn't have to mean anything to you or

882
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:25,320
reflect anything to you it it's just

883
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:27,120
stuff that we did and we did as a

884
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:28,460
personal experience yeah we're just

885
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:30,780
literally buddies having ideas want to

886
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:33,320
do cool stuff for people right I mean

887
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:35,370
everything that we've done we did not

888
00:35:35,370 --> 00:35:38,070
fun crafts did not make a single penny

889
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:40,830
of profit that's that's taking a

890
00:35:40,830 --> 00:35:45,390
positive spin on it but any man those

891
00:35:45,390 --> 00:35:47,070
 heading up I wouldn't regret it

892
00:35:47,070 --> 00:35:48,600
heading up I wouldn't regret it
for a second I think it was just

893
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:50,750
definitely the thing I'm most proud of

894
00:35:50,750 --> 00:35:54,000
anything I've done so far I am and it

895
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,200
was great so I run at another conference

896
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:59,610
this is my other conference it's an

897
00:35:59,610 --> 00:36:02,040
apple compazine Tony yes guy so I've

898
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:03,660
decided to treat funk off as the

899
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:05,250
shedding of my puppy fat I do plan on

900
00:36:05,250 --> 00:36:06,930
doing other conferences and it'll is

901
00:36:06,930 --> 00:36:08,670
that little bit less off the wall but

902
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:10,740
I've taken stuff that I've learned and i

903
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:13,680
plan to kind of a apply that i think my

904
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,960
