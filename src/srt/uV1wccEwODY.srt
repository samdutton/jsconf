1
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:11,620

technical problems all right excellent

2
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:14,730
why are you guys here let's go a little

3
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:17,850
meta for a moment here why are you here

4
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:22,230
in this room with me now cats cats are

5
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:24,210
pretty pretty pretty good answer you

6
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:26,250
might also say that you're here because

7
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:27,750
you want to learn more about node and

8
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:29,760
that's a pretty great answer I'm going

9
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,800
to persuade you I hope that that's not

10
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,630
the only answer you can have to that

11
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:36,960
question it's not everything you could

12
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,230
be getting from node comp or Jas vests

13
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:46,039
in general and to tell you why I'm here

14
00:00:46,039 --> 00:00:49,260
I'm here because I get something here

15
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:56,340
that I can't get anywhere else cats I

16
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:58,140
can get cats anywhere I got to confess

17
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:00,000
this to you i have i have cats at home

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,949
there are cat slides on every single

19
00:01:01,949 --> 00:01:05,820
slide deck in the universe right I get

20
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:07,500
to tell you a story about me in the node

21
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,330
community and why I get something here

22
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:12,210
that I don't get anywhere else I'm going

23
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:15,659
to start by telling you who I am why

24
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:17,310
does Michael think I'm a node badass I

25
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:18,869
don't know why he thinks I'm a noted

26
00:01:18,869 --> 00:01:21,960
badass I look like I do DevOps a 10pm

27
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:25,070
every time you install a package or

28
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:28,170
publish a package your work goes through

29
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:33,240
my code I have the responsibility of

30
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:36,780
keeping that flowing I am plugged in

31
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:39,479
very deeply to the heart of the node

32
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:43,619
community but it wasn't always like that

33
00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:45,689
for me I have not been plugged into the

34
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:48,500
heart of known community for very long

35
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:51,810
we had to tell you about what my life

36
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:54,090
was like before I was a part of this

37
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:57,509
community when I was a solo cat I've

38
00:01:57,509 --> 00:01:59,070
been writing software professionally for

39
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:00,960
a long time possibly longer than some of

40
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,259
you in this audience have been alive

41
00:02:03,259 --> 00:02:06,299
literally I first got paid for it in

42
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:08,190
1996 but I've been writing code for a

43
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:11,190
lot longer than that at the time that I

44
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:13,380
got started my community of practice

45
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:15,840
the the phrase that Carter used earlier

46
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:21,630
is was myself and my coworkers I learned

47
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:24,330
how to program more or less on my own

48
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:26,700
and for my coworkers I did not

49
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:28,980
participate in any communities at all I

50
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:31,260
didn't go to events like this if events

51
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:33,600
like this existed I didn't know about

52
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:37,080
them and that was that was pretty good

53
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:39,270
actually I have had a great career I've

54
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:41,040
worked on a lot of great things I've had

55
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,830
a lot of fun I found node completely on

56
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:48,030
my own I was as a friend shot said i was

57
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:49,980
i was interested in the async nature of

58
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:53,580
things i found node around 04 i taught

59
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:55,920
myself how to program node using the

60
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:00,180
code examples in the node node source

61
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,790
and from the code examples with express

62
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:05,730
i did not seek out anybody's help

63
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:09,410
learning knowed I was may be aware that

64
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:11,670
there was a community of people using

65
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:14,490
node but it didn't occur to me that you

66
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:18,540
all or somebody I should or could talk

67
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:23,280
to to get anything from I did this all

68
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,780
on my own

69
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:28,860
and then I did a really really scary

70
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:33,540
thing I published a package on NPM this

71
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:36,000
is the first time in my life that I had

72
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,859
ever participated and what I would call

73
00:03:37,859 --> 00:03:40,409
a programming community and this is the

74
00:03:40,409 --> 00:03:43,049
safest of all possible ways to

75
00:03:43,049 --> 00:03:44,310
participate in a programming community

76
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:46,920
to it's it's it's almost completely

77
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:49,079
anonymous right no one knows to know who

78
00:03:49,079 --> 00:03:51,000
you are you use a handle but you know

79
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,420
that's divorced from everything else

80
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:56,430
like CG bot do you know who siege bot is

81
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:57,750
you probably don't know who sees bot is

82
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:02,310
my my my icon on github is of a rocket

83
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:04,139
launch at Cape Canaveral that's you

84
00:04:04,139 --> 00:04:05,220
don't know that that's a woman or not

85
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:10,230
like it's just so putting that toe in

86
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:14,099
the water ever so gently right but I was

87
00:04:14,099 --> 00:04:18,630
still terrified it was this was you guys

88
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:20,400
probably published packages on NPM all

89
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,419
the time and don't even think about it

90
00:04:21,419 --> 00:04:23,490
that's that's actually a triumph I was

91
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:27,330
scared about this there were maybe a few

92
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:29,160
thousand packages on NPM what if

93
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:33,740
somebody noticed mine what if I had bugs

94
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:39,690
what if i was using node wrong it just

95
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:42,500
is a spoiler my first package had bugs I

96
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:45,150
almost I pitched I published a patch

97
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:47,130
release like half an hour after

98
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:48,360
publishing it because I found a bug he

99
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,430
was very embarrassing I probably was

100
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:53,430
using node wrong because I'd always

101
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:56,460
known for who knew what was going on but

102
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:59,070
I was scared that people would yell at

103
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:03,000
me or laugh at me which is a thing that

104
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,940
happens right I've seen people's code

105
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:08,159
get eviscerated on Twitter right people

106
00:05:08,159 --> 00:05:09,840
have github repos other people mock them

107
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,659
why would you do that I was really

108
00:05:12,659 --> 00:05:16,409
nervous about that in fact nothing bad

109
00:05:16,409 --> 00:05:20,659
happened nobody commented on my bug

110
00:05:20,659 --> 00:05:22,979
nobody made fun of me for publishing a

111
00:05:22,979 --> 00:05:29,770
package on NPM I did it again

112
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:33,600
but this is the thing that happens when

113
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,120
you participate in community even in a

114
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,580
simple tiny way like publishing a

115
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:40,200
package on NPM you make yourself

116
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:43,470
vulnerable I made myself vulnerable by

117
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:45,630
putting a little bit of myself out into

118
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:47,730
public in the form of a little bit of

119
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:51,570
code and any participation in a

120
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:53,880
community requires this it's a side

121
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,560
effect it's what happens when you do it

122
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,120
you're all here sitting here in front of

123
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,630
me I can I could look at you I see you I

124
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:03,270
can make fun of primes t-shirt if I felt

125
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:04,770
like it he's made himself vulnerable

126
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:10,400
just by being the same room as me so

127
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:14,490
participation entails risk humans are

128
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:17,670
spiky and dangerous sometimes except

129
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:22,590
that a lot of the time they're not as I

130
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:26,400
discovered with this community with you

131
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:32,490
guys this community welcome to me that

132
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:34,820
was actually it for me for a long time I

133
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:37,590
got going on NPM I got going with node i

134
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:39,090
did a bunch of stuff i published the

135
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:43,350
modules I got a node job I met some

136
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:47,190
people and then I went to node

137
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:49,740
conference this was a big mode move for

138
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:51,570
me I'd never done this before I was like

139
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:53,340
well I'm not sure what I'm going to get

140
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:55,320
out of this but it seems really exciting

141
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:57,630
and I've seen these peoples names on

142
00:06:57,630 --> 00:07:00,540
modules that i use and I'm kind of kind

143
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:02,490
of really excited to maybe meet some of

144
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:05,310
them even though that was really scary

145
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:08,040
this is not my first conference I went

146
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:11,160
to sig chi and 99 that was giant I hated

147
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,840
it was miserable I didn't try to repeat

148
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,760
that experience so I went to node cough

149
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:19,680
I knew one person there my coworker kit

150
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:23,130
that was it I did a lot of sitting on my

151
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:25,770
own at lunch and meals because I didn't

152
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:30,750
know anybody right meanwhile this

153
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:34,140
community is happening all around me

154
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:36,540
does it sound sort of depressing but

155
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:39,090
like I I didn't know anybody and i sat

156
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:41,940
on my own at lunch it wasn't

157
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:47,820
no cough 2013 was amazing for me it

158
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:51,660
changed everything for me it was though

159
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:53,880
I got to sit in the very first node

160
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,520
school experience the stream adventure

161
00:07:55,520 --> 00:08:00,780
which was fantastic and then something

162
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:05,760
really wild happened I met people Bryce

163
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:08,520
you're in here right yeah there you are

164
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:11,130
you and I we met each other at node cop

165
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:13,140
2013 and we both didn't know anybody

166
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:16,860
right and now we know people it's

167
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:20,850
amazing I talked to rod bag because he

168
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:22,950
had noticed that I had published modules

169
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:25,500
on NPM that used level up and he wanted

170
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,210
you is really excited about that and he

171
00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:29,150
wanted to talk to me about level up I

172
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:34,500
said oh whoa that was that was wild i

173
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:35,909
just talked to rod bag I wrote this

174
00:08:35,909 --> 00:08:40,830
level up thing this is so awesome and

175
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:43,620
then another thing happened I'm still on

176
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:46,230
node comp 2013 here I there was this

177
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:47,760
another session that was live coding

178
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:51,240
with Dominic thar mr. got to your gassed

179
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:54,870
and isn't here and rhinos they they did

180
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:57,480
this live coded distributed chat service

181
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:01,550
thing and my mind just went kaboom I

182
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:05,010
went home I wrote three modules on NPM

183
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:07,860
using scuttlebutt and consistent

184
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:11,220
replicated documents and they're

185
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:12,750
completely frivolous modules no one

186
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:14,340
should use them for anything but I was

187
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:17,790
so excited about that I it was it was

188
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:21,720
this just massive inspiration thing I

189
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:24,030
went home excited about node excited

190
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:26,510
about programming excited about

191
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:29,220
everything around me I want you guys to

192
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:31,290
go hope you're that excited about monkey

193
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:34,290
patching or about building wearable

194
00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:40,200
clothing or about that guy named check

195
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,690
Dominic tar a little bit more so said

196
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:44,160
that he's not here because because he's

197
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:48,360
he's somebody he doesn't know he's the

198
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:51,810
star of this little story but he's my

199
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:55,730
mad science at conferences inspiration

200
00:09:55,730 --> 00:10:01,050
he I see him only at conferences boring

201
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:04,110
bars surrounding conferences every time

202
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:05,490
I see him I talked to him about

203
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:07,140
something that completely blows my mind

204
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:13,980
we talked about encrypted Merkel trees

205
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:17,310
was stuck with cryptographic hashes that

206
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:18,810
you can trust so you can have secure

207
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:22,620
distributed databases he asked me to do

208
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:24,390
some things about like making content on

209
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:26,760
NPM addressable via its hash so that he

210
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,709
can always get at stuff and this is like

211
00:10:28,709 --> 00:10:30,420
the coolest thing ever i would never

212
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:32,730
think about cryptographically signing

213
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:34,470
merkel trees unless Dominic tar was

214
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:37,769
there to tell me all about it and it

215
00:10:37,769 --> 00:10:40,680
doesn't need to know that he inspires me

216
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:42,300
this way all he has to do is be himself

217
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:51,060
and talk guess what you're mad slides

218
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:52,290
inspiration might be in this room right

219
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:56,850
now it might be well Dominic isn't here

220
00:10:56,850 --> 00:10:58,380
so he can't be your inspiration right

221
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:00,300
now the sub stack might be our node

222
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:04,709
botanist might be um max I'm a fan Tosh

223
00:11:04,709 --> 00:11:07,199
blew my mind earlier today with that I

224
00:11:07,199 --> 00:11:09,600
am going to go home this weekend I'm

225
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,740
going to write I'm going to have the

226
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:12,480
equivalent of like this explosion of

227
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,829
modules because i'm going to use that

228
00:11:13,829 --> 00:11:15,660
for something i'm going to figure out

229
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:17,699
what that is good for i'm going to play

230
00:11:17,699 --> 00:11:20,279
with it all weekend i am so excited

231
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:29,490
right now here's another flip side you

232
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:32,610
yes you might be somebody's mad science

233
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:36,180
inspiration Cassandra you're mad sizes

234
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:43,940
for inspiration guaranteed all right

235
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:47,820
touchy feely right here's another wacky

236
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:50,610
thing that happened at node comp 2013

237
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:52,829
because i'm still in how one stupid

238
00:11:52,829 --> 00:11:54,089
conference changed my life right now

239
00:11:54,089 --> 00:11:57,269
okay I met Rick waldron he did it the

240
00:11:57,269 --> 00:12:01,019
the node BOTS session at node call 2013

241
00:12:01,019 --> 00:12:03,480
and you know he threw me a leap motion

242
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,949
controller before that these things have

243
00:12:04,949 --> 00:12:06,510
been released and I made my little crazy

244
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:08,310
fly copter go up and down and land and

245
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:09,810
crash into people and responses elite

246
00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:12,270
motion commands and then he did this

247
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:15,839
this really nasty nasty thing to me he

248
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:18,810
volunteered me to give a talk at

249
00:12:18,810 --> 00:12:21,480
cascadia j/s and somehow talked me into

250
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:24,420
giving an intro to robotics talk at

251
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:28,050
cascadia Jas and this was literally the

252
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:30,510
first time I had ever gotten it in front

253
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:32,610
of a room of people had talked about

254
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:38,699
something he met me at a conference I

255
00:12:38,699 --> 00:12:41,899
decided I could do that and I did it and

256
00:12:41,899 --> 00:12:47,220
it was amazingly fun and I'm standing

257
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:49,860
here now in front of you I think because

258
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:52,829
of that experience that random encounter

259
00:12:52,829 --> 00:12:55,140
with someone at a conference who I'd

260
00:12:55,140 --> 00:13:00,329
never met before I'm pretty sure that

261
00:13:00,329 --> 00:13:04,319
that this amazing job at mpm that I have

262
00:13:04,319 --> 00:13:06,839
is the culmination of this experience of

263
00:13:06,839 --> 00:13:11,220
conference going it's I'm now working on

264
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:13,709
the thing that got me involved in

265
00:13:13,709 --> 00:13:15,959
community in the first place that first

266
00:13:15,959 --> 00:13:18,480
package that I published that was me

267
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,630
putting my toe in the water I'm now all

268
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:26,600
the way in it and it is fantastic

269
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:30,360
so okay I'm talking about me and all

270
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,220
this stuff that happens to me am i

271
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:39,540
special no I'm just a human being I took

272
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:43,709
the first step though I went and I made

273
00:13:43,709 --> 00:13:46,200
contact with other human beings I went

274
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,750
to that conference and I shook Bryce's

275
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:52,230
hand and I talked to rod bag and I said

276
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:54,750
yes to Rick Waldron when he wanted to

277
00:13:54,750 --> 00:14:00,209
give me a leap motion controller this is

278
00:14:00,209 --> 00:14:02,700
I think should be no surprise to anybody

279
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:05,510
we are social animals we thrive on

280
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:08,100
connecting with other people and we

281
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:09,779
especially thrive on meet each other

282
00:14:09,779 --> 00:14:14,850
face to face we the human contact is how

283
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:16,470
we we get to know each other and we meet

284
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:18,420
each other Rick thought I could give a

285
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:20,190
talk because he'd actually met me and

286
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:25,860
see me talk and see me code so the way

287
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:28,050
the world works is not a secret I love

288
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:30,570
to say this humans are social animals we

289
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:32,550
we do a better job connecting with

290
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:34,410
people we've met at least once and

291
00:14:34,410 --> 00:14:37,350
that's what's happening right now here

292
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:39,420
in this room social connections or how

293
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:41,519
our industry works it's how our lives

294
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:47,279
work admit it live with it it's another

295
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:53,600
amazing thing that happens serendipity I

296
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,970
did not know what I woke up this morning

297
00:14:56,970 --> 00:14:59,370
when I got on bart that I would be

298
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:02,430
excited about debt I had no flipping

299
00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:04,769
clue if I max didn't know he was going

300
00:15:04,769 --> 00:15:09,990
to be talking about that this is this is

301
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:11,850
this is the awesome thing that happens

302
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:13,290
at these conferences that can't happen

303
00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:15,180
anywhere else I am going to have our

304
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:17,329
chance encounter with someone of you

305
00:15:17,329 --> 00:15:19,769
after this talk is over and you're going

306
00:15:19,769 --> 00:15:21,329
to tell me about something exciting that

307
00:15:21,329 --> 00:15:23,459
I didn't know existed then I couldn't

308
00:15:23,459 --> 00:15:27,720
have predicted existed surprising things

309
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,430
come from new experiences we learn

310
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:30,540
better when we're having new experiences

311
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:32,459
we're more creative when we're having

312
00:15:32,459 --> 00:15:34,260
new experiences you're stuck in a rut Go

313
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:35,819
Travel somewhere you haven't been before

314
00:15:35,819 --> 00:15:37,980
go travel to a conference meet someone

315
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:39,600
you haven't met before

316
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:43,900
add newness to your life in some way

317
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:46,589
being here at this conference makes that

318
00:15:46,589 --> 00:15:48,980
happen almost automatically if you

319
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:51,029
introduce yourself to someone you

320
00:15:51,029 --> 00:15:53,759
haven't met before you are bringing new

321
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:55,380
things into your mind that you hadn't

322
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:57,420
thought about our experience before and

323
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:59,810
that is going to teach you something

324
00:15:59,810 --> 00:16:09,889
completely new okay cats and love cats I

325
00:16:09,889 --> 00:16:12,690
was not noticed that there's just sort

326
00:16:12,690 --> 00:16:14,670
of a thread through all this I haven't

327
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:17,009
actually been a passive consumer of this

328
00:16:17,009 --> 00:16:22,889
community experience I took risks every

329
00:16:22,889 --> 00:16:24,360
single one of the opportunities I've had

330
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:26,490
or the experiences I had at no cough

331
00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:31,410
2013 paid off for me because I met him I

332
00:16:31,410 --> 00:16:36,990
met them halfway I had to be a stranger

333
00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:39,899
I had to have a conversation with rod

334
00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:42,360
I'd had to take that risk and publish

335
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:45,329
that first module I had to make myself

336
00:16:45,329 --> 00:16:48,329
vulnerable and put myself out in a way

337
00:16:48,329 --> 00:16:50,790
that you know maybe for some of you it's

338
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:53,189
easy your extra verts but I'm kind of

339
00:16:53,189 --> 00:16:54,810
not I like to sit in a corner and write

340
00:16:54,810 --> 00:16:57,060
code all of this experience has been me

341
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:59,130
pushing myself into some place where I'd

342
00:16:59,130 --> 00:17:01,380
never bed before here I stand in front

343
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:03,600
of you telling you about this story

344
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,740
about me I don't know whether you're

345
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:05,760
going to judge me for it or whether

346
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,020
you're interested before whether you're

347
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:09,270
falling asleep or not but this this also

348
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:11,520
is a moment of vulnerability that I hope

349
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:15,900
is going to pay off because I hope to to

350
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:17,549
get you guys excited about participating

351
00:17:17,549 --> 00:17:24,569
in this community there's is one more

352
00:17:24,569 --> 00:17:26,339
thing I want to talk about about

353
00:17:26,339 --> 00:17:31,049
community participation I want to talk

354
00:17:31,049 --> 00:17:35,880
about responsibility

355
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:38,750
every one of the opportunities that I

356
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:40,640
took advantage of comes with the flip

357
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:41,870
side and that flip side is a

358
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:44,690
responsibility that I took on what I

359
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:47,330
decided to take advantage of do

360
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:50,000
something exciting here's an easy

361
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,570
example working at mpm right I'm at the

362
00:17:53,570 --> 00:17:55,070
heart of the community that is actually

363
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:57,920
an enormous responsibility I hold the

364
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:00,050
heart of the node community in my hands

365
00:18:00,050 --> 00:18:01,850
I can bring you all down I can make it

366
00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:05,000
not work and which is not something I

367
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,130
ever want to do but that it's like my

368
00:18:07,130 --> 00:18:09,950
daily job is is important and it's it's

369
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:11,900
a burden and it's it's something I take

370
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:15,890
on and to give back to all of you all

371
00:18:15,890 --> 00:18:17,720
right that's like big and like

372
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,640
mechanical but it's actually at a

373
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:23,900
smaller level 2 when I stand up here and

374
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:26,930
i gave a talk to you I have a

375
00:18:26,930 --> 00:18:30,590
responsibility to do it well to tell you

376
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:31,880
something that you didn't already know

377
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:34,340
before to inspire you to give you

378
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:36,260
something you didn't have I don't want

379
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:39,170
to just stand up here like a look at me

380
00:18:39,170 --> 00:18:40,700
and I awesome no this is a

381
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:42,940
responsibility that I feel towards you

382
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:45,050
because I'm participating in the

383
00:18:45,050 --> 00:18:47,990
community and there's let's let's make

384
00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:52,430
it even smaller than that being kind and

385
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:55,220
welcoming to other people your behavior

386
00:18:55,220 --> 00:19:00,200
here affects other people you can make

387
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,670
the difference between a newcomer like

388
00:19:01,670 --> 00:19:04,030
me havin a miserable experience and

389
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:06,410
continuing to eat meals by myself and

390
00:19:06,410 --> 00:19:08,600
not meeting people having an amazing

391
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:11,420
experience a life-changing experience a

392
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:14,000
friend building experience I had an

393
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,310
amazing node cough because the people

394
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:17,990
around me take that responsibility

395
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:19,970
seriously they were kind and welcoming

396
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:26,169
to me and that was fantastic

397
00:19:26,179 --> 00:19:27,679
all of you are part of the node

398
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:31,639
community just by being here your

399
00:19:31,639 --> 00:19:33,409
president at a tiny conference right

400
00:19:33,409 --> 00:19:36,379
you're already like risk-taking in a

401
00:19:36,379 --> 00:19:39,379
really big way that responsibility is

402
00:19:39,379 --> 00:19:43,759
already yours okay how many of you in

403
00:19:43,759 --> 00:19:46,399
this room know me like like get a hug

404
00:19:46,399 --> 00:19:50,629
for me what do you mean okay that's

405
00:19:50,629 --> 00:19:52,009
that's not enough the rest of you can

406
00:19:52,009 --> 00:19:54,200
know me too and if you don't know me if

407
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,759
you--if like I don't look interesting

408
00:19:55,759 --> 00:19:56,960
there's somebody else in this room you

409
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:59,299
could be who's pretty interesting you

410
00:19:59,299 --> 00:20:01,220
could this is a tiny conference we could

411
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:03,200
end up knowing each other every single

412
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,940
one of these people every single one of

413
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:06,259
you guys could know me and know each

414
00:20:06,259 --> 00:20:07,639
other at the end of this conference I

415
00:20:07,639 --> 00:20:09,259
bet we could do it if you felt like it

416
00:20:09,259 --> 00:20:14,720
but the very least I want you to

417
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,940
encourage somebody be somebody's

418
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:19,940
inspiration be kind in your github

419
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:22,249
conversations answer questions in a

420
00:20:22,249 --> 00:20:24,830
friendly way share your code on github

421
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:28,159
or in 9 p.m. if you can mentor a node

422
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:30,889
school you want it that's actually not

423
00:20:30,889 --> 00:20:32,600
very hard to do you don't have to run a

424
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,129
note school just be mentor at a note

425
00:20:34,129 --> 00:20:37,240
school it's easy and it's awesome

426
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:39,499
watching newbies get going with node is

427
00:20:39,499 --> 00:20:41,690
really fun it reminds you of what your

428
00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:45,159
new node experience was the first time

429
00:20:45,159 --> 00:20:47,480
if you want to like move to advanced

430
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,730
levels run a node school talk at a

431
00:20:49,730 --> 00:20:56,299
conference let yourself be encouraged if

432
00:20:56,299 --> 00:20:58,369
you saw a talk today they got you really

433
00:20:58,369 --> 00:21:03,049
stoked roll with it be stoked write code

434
00:21:03,049 --> 00:21:04,879
do something with that monkey patch

435
00:21:04,879 --> 00:21:06,830
something ridiculous I want every one of

436
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:08,149
us to go home and watch you pack Bucky

437
00:21:08,149 --> 00:21:10,159
patch something horrible that would be

438
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:13,549
awesome take the risks when somebody

439
00:21:13,549 --> 00:21:15,399
offers you an opportunity here take it

440
00:21:15,399 --> 00:21:18,049
maybe not every opportunity but I want

441
00:21:18,049 --> 00:21:20,570
you to be a little bit daring do it this

442
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:22,190
is how our community is built this is

443
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:24,529
like where it comes from this is like

444
00:21:24,529 --> 00:21:27,110
all of it right there encouraging other

445
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:29,779
people at being encouraged yourself it's

446
00:21:29,779 --> 00:21:32,659
why we're here it's why I'm here I'm

447
00:21:32,659 --> 00:21:35,480
here because of that moment when Max was

448
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:38,119
talking about that and I said oh my god

449
00:21:38,119 --> 00:21:38,970
that's

450
00:21:38,970 --> 00:21:45,419
fantastic it's going to be okay this

451
00:21:45,419 --> 00:21:47,130
community is awesome I think there's a

452
00:21:47,130 --> 00:21:49,740
reason i picked this community rather

453
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:52,380
than any other two to do my little

454
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:55,370
daring stepping out from my cubicle farm

455
00:21:55,370 --> 00:21:58,169
i have had nothing but fantastic

456
00:21:58,169 --> 00:22:00,750
experiences the fact that i'm standing

457
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:03,630
in front of you at all right now is an

458
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:05,789
existence proof there's nothing special

459
00:22:05,789 --> 00:22:08,130
about me all of this can happen to you

460
00:22:08,130 --> 00:22:12,150
to take the shot take the chance i want

461
00:22:12,150 --> 00:22:20,940
to see you up here next year thanks CJ
