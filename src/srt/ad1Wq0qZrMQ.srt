00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,240

oh alrights just verifying am i heard

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:07,710
yeah okay it's going to keep this coming

3
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:09,210
close to nut all right all right so

4
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:10,860
hello everybody I'm tab Atkins I work

5
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:12,660
for Google I am a member of the CSS

6
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:14,910
working group and a number of other spec

7
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:17,250
working groups and I've been doing specs

8
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:18,990
for six or seven years now it's

9
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:21,900
disappears to be my passion is a number

10
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:23,609
of links up there and whatnot if you

11
00:00:23,609 --> 00:00:24,630
want to follow the slides there's a

12
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:25,949
couple of useful links in them that you

13
00:00:25,949 --> 00:00:27,960
can click on I don't have the URLs

14
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:29,490
visible so you want to click on them

15
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:32,130
that's the talk today or you just go to

16
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:33,540
slash talks and choose the one with the

17
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:37,790
right date so I'm going to once this

18
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:40,590
talk today about the future of CSS this

19
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:42,540
is a smaller screen so it's even more

20
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:46,079
here than you even know or at least a

21
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:47,789
little bit of it a lot of specs that

22
00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:51,899
I've worked on that I have been excited

23
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:53,610
about for the last several years and I

24
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:55,110
have a lot of stuff and not a lot of

25
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:56,309
time so we'll be going through pretty

26
00:00:56,309 --> 00:00:58,920
quickly here this is not meant to be a

27
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:00,989
let's learn about lots of stuff deep

28
00:01:00,989 --> 00:01:02,969
dive it's just a here's a bunch of cool

29
00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:04,470
stuff I will mention one sentence about

30
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:06,689
each of them more or less and you can

31
00:01:06,689 --> 00:01:08,490
learn more about them later just to get

32
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:10,619
you excited let you know the landscape

33
00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:14,430
of the stuff i swear i can get this

34
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:17,700
working oh that's better okay cool so

35
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:21,810
we're going to start with image values

36
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:23,400
this was actually my very first spec

37
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,590
when i started working on CSS it was the

38
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:26,970
thing that got me into the working group

39
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:29,280
I was like web kits original gradient

40
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,770
function is I can make a better

41
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:33,450
grammar for it and I did and they were

42
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:34,799
like why don't you just write the spec

43
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:38,939
you basically already done so so some of

44
00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:39,960
the new things are showing up here

45
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:42,060
exciting one is the image function a

46
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:45,060
souped-up URL three examples of

47
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:46,619
functionality right here that lets you

48
00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:48,930
do just a small bits that are worthwhile

49
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:51,810
the first one shows off fall back to a

50
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:56,090
color if you have so you have a light

51
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:58,649
website background dark buttons with

52
00:01:58,649 --> 00:02:00,360
white text on them you're using a dark

53
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:02,250
background image so that the white text

54
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:04,560
offsets nicely but if that image 404s

55
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,630
you're screwed white text on to a white

56
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:08,610
background because there's no nothing

57
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:10,770
the contrast against anymore you can use

58
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:12,390
the image function once it's implemented

59
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:13,500
to say if the

60
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,540
image doesn't load just go ahead and

61
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:18,210
make a color for me it's good enough so

62
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:20,130
instead of a dark background image that

63
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:21,060
you would like you'll have a black

64
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:24,390
square better than nothing the second

65
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:27,300
one is just straight-up color images

66
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:29,880
easy way to generate if you ever needed

67
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,860
solid color images right now you can do

68
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,570
so with linear gradient you just repeat

69
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:34,680
your color twice and it kind of

70
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,390
generates it but that's a kind of a

71
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:38,010
weird hack image lets you go more

72
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:39,840
directly you just leave off the URL and

73
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,430
the color that's left there will

74
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:43,110
generate a solid color image for you in

75
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:45,510
this particular case I am blue tinting a

76
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:46,980
background by putting a partially

77
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:49,440
transparent blue image on top of another

78
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,739
background image the third one if you've

79
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:54,780
heard about everybody's used image

80
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:57,480
spriting at some point this shows off a

81
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:00,750
syntax for media fragments that lets you

82
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:03,209
do image spriting directly this rather

83
00:03:03,209 --> 00:03:04,500
than having to do weird hacks with

84
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:05,940
background position and background size

85
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:07,860
you can literally say load up this

86
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:10,700
sprite sheet food up PNG and give me the

87
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:12,930
rectangle with these coordinates that's

88
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:14,400
the image I want gives you the correct

89
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,000
size let's a repeat etc the problem is

90
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,940
though that if a browser doesn't support

91
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:22,830
media fragments it'll just show you the

92
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:23,940
whole sprite sheet will mess everything

93
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:26,580
up image requires the browser to

94
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:29,700
understand the syntax of the hash or

95
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:33,480
else it will just fail so you can use

96
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,730
this kind of thing safely older browsers

97
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:37,320
will just ignore it ones that don't

98
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:39,120
understand the fragment syntax if we

99
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,890
introduce new fragments in Texas or new

100
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:42,630
types of things to images in the future

101
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:44,760
same thing it'll let you do fall back at

102
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:49,650
the syntax level very nicely next up is

103
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:51,209
the image set function this has been

104
00:03:51,209 --> 00:03:52,950
around for a while it was introduced by

105
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:56,510
WebKit in the before chrome forked from

106
00:03:56,510 --> 00:03:59,430
the codebase if you're familiar with the

107
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:01,470
picture element and the image source set

108
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:03,150
attribute that I've also worked on a bit

109
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:05,190
this does similar functionality there

110
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:07,260
right now it does just the basic stuff

111
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:09,090
you give a URL you give a density it

112
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:10,980
chooses which one it wants to load based

113
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:12,989
on the user's screen and then

114
00:04:12,989 --> 00:04:14,370
potentially other things their

115
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:18,510
connection speed etc in time it will be

116
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:20,370
upgraded to match picture fully in

117
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:22,650
functionality similar functionality to

118
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:25,110
what sizes and the W descriptor does you

119
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:26,880
can already use media queries

120
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,860
just naturally in CSS to get the same

121
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:30,330
functionality of art direction that

122
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:34,920
picture allows etc the crossfade

123
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:37,020
function lets you smoothly fade between

124
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:39,390
two images this currently already works

125
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:43,950
in WebKit and blink a safari and opera

126
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:47,010
and chrome slightly older syntax and

127
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:48,180
what's presented here and in the spec

128
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:49,470
but will change to it whenever we

129
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:52,140
unfreeze fun thing is this is used

130
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:54,990
already by the animation CSS animations

131
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:57,270
to do animation between images what I'm

132
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:58,830
showing right here is literally just an

133
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:00,660
animation going between for background

134
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:02,550
images and it uses crossfade to

135
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:04,920
automatically give you the transition

136
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:08,820
behavior I don't let's not install all

137
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:15,420
right cool image rendering controls how

138
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:18,360
an image scales there we go the original

139
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,430
image is there I blow it up by two times

140
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:22,530
in each dimension the original they like

141
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:24,990
normal behavior using a bilinear scaling

142
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:27,360
looks freaking terrible because this is

143
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,190
pixel art this kind of scaling algorithm

144
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:31,020
is designed for photos and nice smooth

145
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:34,470
things new values pixelated lets it keep

146
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:37,260
the big chunky pixel look so it looks

147
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:39,450
nice when it scales up pixel art crisp

148
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:42,120
edges has the potential to do even more

149
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,710
advanced things it's allowed to fall

150
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:45,810
back to the same as pixelated but it can

151
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:47,520
use advanced pixel art scaling

152
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,310
algorithms like those pioneered by a lot

153
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:52,530
of game emulators and what not to do

154
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:54,690
smoother things this and i forget what

155
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:56,280
exact algorithm this is an example of

156
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:58,860
but it's able to infer angles and colors

157
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:02,290
and whatnot for you automatically

158
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:06,750
alright next spec is flexbox everybody

159
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:08,190
is hopefully heard of flexbox hopefully

160
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:09,570
you're already using it it's pretty

161
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:12,030
widely available now so you don't have

162
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:14,700
much excuse unless you're still on ie6

163
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:18,570
who knows i'm not going to talk too much

164
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:21,930
about this just up the main reasons for

165
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:25,500
it flex box plus the next thing i'll be

166
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,690
talking about solves basically all your

167
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:30,360
layout woes there's still a few cases i

168
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,950
want to hit up but this does ninety

169
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:33,870
percent of everything you can lay out

170
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:35,880
things in any direction left down

171
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:38,729
upright with flex flow you can change

172
00:06:38,729 --> 00:06:40,200
the order of things without messing with

173
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:40,710
your mark

174
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:42,960
putting things in nice accessible order

175
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,550
with your content first and add second

176
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:46,290
and then just swapping them around on

177
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:48,360
display you can do vertical and

178
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,130
horizontal alignment including sintering

179
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:52,110
if you're still making jokes about CSS

180
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:54,210
centering you are several years out of

181
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:57,480
date by now and finally flexibility

182
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:00,090
allowing things to grow or shrink to

183
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:02,880
fill the available space very important

184
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,590
there's a lot of fun examples which I'll

185
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:07,890
have a nice link to in a little while I

186
00:07:07,890 --> 00:07:09,450
really wish I could do an entire talk

187
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:11,250
about flex because I love talking about

188
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:14,880
that but that's not for today so the

189
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,610
partner to flex is gridlayout flexbox is

190
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:19,650
designed for linear layouts anything

191
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:21,150
that's one dimensional perhaps broken

192
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:23,070
across lines because you can do a

193
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:24,510
multi-line flexbox but it's still

194
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:27,270
essentially things in order grid is

195
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:29,160
designed for two-dimensional layout what

196
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:32,580
is really going on for pages basically

197
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:33,870
all the things that you could do with

198
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:36,840
table layout grid makes it possible to

199
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:39,090
do but ridiculously easier and not

200
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:41,090
terrible markup and maintainable

201
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:45,030
everything's great so quick example here

202
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:47,400
is one possible layout of a little game

203
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,920
design thing title score stats board

204
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,720
controls everybody can probably imagine

205
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,310
how they might mark that up use floats

206
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:55,710
or what not to put it into place but

207
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:57,690
with grid it's literally nothing more

208
00:07:57,690 --> 00:08:00,300
than using a bit of ASCII art on the

209
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:02,340
container to define your page markup and

210
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:05,850
then telling each piece which section of

211
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:07,800
the ASCII art to go into the title goes

212
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,440
into the block a here's the real magic

213
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:13,560
this is a portrait orientation taller

214
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,840
than it is wide if you want it to handle

215
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:19,110
landscape as well really easily like

216
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:20,820
this layout same stuff just in a

217
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:23,160
completely different arrangement all you

218
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,870
have to do is change your Styles a

219
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:26,040
little bit give a different layout

220
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:29,400
they'll all sit in the same tile so you

221
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,630
can just use a media query to

222
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:32,130
drastically change the layout of your

223
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:34,980
page adapting to different sizes layouts

224
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:37,260
orientations etc rather than the

225
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:39,150
ridiculous series of hacks that we have

226
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:42,900
to do today to get the same thing if

227
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:44,610
you're following along on my slides

228
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:46,260
here's a bunch of great links you should

229
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:48,360
follow rachel andrews grid by example is

230
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,250
a wonderful compendium of a lot of use

231
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:52,830
cases like real world places where you

232
00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:54,270
might use grid and how to do so

233
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:56,490
examples Phillip Walt installed by

234
00:08:56,490 --> 00:08:58,380
flexbox is the same thing but for flex

235
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:01,020
box and then CSS tricks has great grid

236
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:03,960
and flexbox guides you can just google

237
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,270
for those or follow along these links on

238
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:12,030
my slides the selector spec selectors

239
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:14,610
level for the first specs that was in

240
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:16,410
level 4 but that's kind of not even a

241
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:18,620
big thing today we have a bunch of them

242
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:20,670
so touch on a few of the more

243
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:23,010
interesting additions the inth child

244
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:24,930
pseudo-class now does selector based

245
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:28,200
indexing that first selector li foo in

246
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,000
the child even doesn't do what you might

247
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,700
think it finds list items that are dot

248
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:36,360
foo and that are even not the even that

249
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,970
foos you know it doesn't let you count

250
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:41,130
particular things just elements

251
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:42,990
themselves so you can now move the

252
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:45,240
selector into the selected part that you

253
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,580
want to be counting on into the argument

254
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:49,410
of the imp child and this will now find

255
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:51,750
all the lig foos and then only grab the

256
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:53,400
even ones of them skipping over

257
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:56,280
everything else not implemented yet but

258
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:59,580
should show up in WebKit are yeah and

259
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:01,350
WebKit soon so I think Safari will have

260
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:06,930
this first the matches function lets you

261
00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:09,720
do branching in CSS I've written this

262
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:12,570
kind of code all the time long selector

263
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:14,370
i need to change one bit to apply it as

264
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:15,660
well I have to repeat the entire thing

265
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:19,110
bad for maintenance bad for reading just

266
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:21,420
not a good deal all around using matches

267
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:23,970
I can capture the fact that i want a TD

268
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:25,980
or a th in this case and just put it

269
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:28,650
directly in write a single selector fun

270
00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:30,870
thing to once this is well supported

271
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:33,570
sass can start using this for its extend

272
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:36,960
support and finally get extends to work

273
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:39,390
exactly like it's supposed to right now

274
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:40,980
they have to do a lot of heuristics and

275
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:43,710
they drop some edge cases to avoid a

276
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:46,410
giant selector explosion but matches

277
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:48,570
lets them do the semantics exactly right

278
00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:50,640
without any explosion whatsoever you can

279
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:54,240
do extend in a single nice selector

280
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:59,810
without a bunch of duplication variables

281
00:10:59,810 --> 00:11:02,040
I've been working on variables for quite

282
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,450
a while they've been a request for

283
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:06,300
forever in CSS fun thing they work right

284
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:08,130
now in Firefox if you want to

285
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:10,440
load up modern Firefox and try using

286
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:13,380
variables like this example right here

287
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:18,060
it will work you declare a bunch of

288
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:19,800
properties custom properties using

289
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,150
whatever name you want the only

290
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:22,680
requirement is they have to start with

291
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,900
two dashes give them whatever value you

292
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:28,110
want and then on any descendants of that

293
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:30,210
element you can use that property's

294
00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:32,550
value with the VAR function in this case

295
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:34,590
i'm declaring some colors for my page

296
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:37,200
using them for the a and it's visited

297
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,510
and then also using them on my h1 that

298
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:41,700
way if i want to change my main color at

299
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,020
any point i don't have to go search and

300
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:45,120
replace hope I hit everything that

301
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:49,320
requires it etc and I have nice names on

302
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,790
my values and that's really important

303
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:55,260
for maintainability as well oh we head

304
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:56,580
back real quick like I said it works

305
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:58,500
today in Firefox it works in safari but

306
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:01,890
it's prefixed chrome removed our support

307
00:12:01,890 --> 00:12:04,740
for it that was done in WebKit because

308
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:07,200
it wasn't very good and we are currently

309
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,690
replacing our CSS parser as soon as we

310
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:12,330
do that we will be able to put a good

311
00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:13,950
implementation of variables in so they

312
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:15,900
should show up in chrome soon ish I'd

313
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:18,210
say within in 2015 we should probably

314
00:12:18,210 --> 00:12:23,030
get one do to do to do the color spec

315
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:25,530
I've always been fascinated with colors

316
00:12:25,530 --> 00:12:27,210
if you know me and you follow my blog I

317
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:29,070
have several posts about color stuff

318
00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:31,970
because math and colors are just amazing

319
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:33,930
so I've been working on the color

320
00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:37,050
spectrally a few additions that have

321
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:40,470
been done from author requests for and

322
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:41,940
eight digit hex colors so you can

323
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:44,220
specify your alpha in your hex you don't

324
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:45,990
have to change to the RGB syntax and

325
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:47,790
convert your hex back into decimal just

326
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:49,370
to get a partially transparent color and

327
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:52,620
this functions in general are a little

328
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:55,080
more consistent now alpha values except

329
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,730
percentages right now if you specify

330
00:12:56,730 --> 00:12:58,800
your alpha its of number between 0 and 1

331
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,110
rather than a percentage no idea why

332
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:03,060
just people did weird things when we

333
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:05,670
first invented the color functions the

334
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:07,560
hue values also even though it's a

335
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:09,270
degree around a circle they accept just

336
00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:10,590
integers right now and assume it's

337
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:13,200
degrees so the new functions will accept

338
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,480
real angles so you can use the turn unit

339
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,920
or radians or whatever you want if you

340
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,650
feel like it

341
00:13:18,650 --> 00:13:21,060
there's a few new types of colors as

342
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:25,350
well HW b is a more intuitive variant of

343
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:28,110
hsl easier to use you just declare your

344
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:29,850
hue and then how much white and black to

345
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:31,410
add to the color to get it to a

346
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:33,930
different tinder or whatnot if you've

347
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:36,000
used Chrome's color picker the input

348
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,340
type equals color that color picker is

349
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:40,860
an HW b picker you choose your hue from

350
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:42,210
the ring then you have a triangle with

351
00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:43,980
the hue of the white and the black on

352
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:46,560
each corner and that's exactly the color

353
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:50,340
space you'd be working in with HW b the

354
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:51,990
gray function lets you specify grades

355
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:53,460
that repeating yourself because they

356
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:56,640
have r g and b all the same you can use

357
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:59,640
a percentage or specify a 0 to 255 value

358
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:02,400
just like you do today in RGB and then

359
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,780
the color function which i might

360
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:06,690
probably tweak the syntax of a lot takes

361
00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:08,820
all the as much of the functionality as

362
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:10,590
i can justify from sasses color

363
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:12,570
adjusting functions and bakes them into

364
00:14:12,570 --> 00:14:14,700
CSS this is especially useful when

365
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:17,010
you're using variables in CSS to store

366
00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:18,840
colors because then you can take a few

367
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:21,570
base colors and produce an entire suite

368
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:24,240
of colors for your site based on making

369
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,110
them a little bit lighter a little

370
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:34,500
darker etc media queries so one of the

371
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,780
big problems with dealing with mobiles

372
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:39,000
have gone along is how to convert over

373
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,580
hover based sites and detect when you

374
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:43,770
need to do an alternate solution media

375
00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:46,080
queries are trying to level up to make

376
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,340
these kind of things easier to do when

377
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:49,320
the most important ones here are the two

378
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:51,870
queries pointer and hover which are

379
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:53,820
showing up in chrome now I believe

380
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:55,670
they're being implemented in Firefox

381
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:58,440
they should be around very shortly for

382
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:01,260
everybody in particular the pointer

383
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:03,330
media query has two values course which

384
00:15:03,330 --> 00:15:05,040
means some it's a big fat pointer like

385
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,660
your finger can't select very accurately

386
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:09,300
or fine like a pen or a mouse pointer

387
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:11,760
and then hover is can you hover or not

388
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,430
yes or no and a few examples of the

389
00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:16,320
types of devices you can handle here the

390
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,420
great things about this is that if you

391
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:21,630
handle a coarse pointer properly just

392
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:23,430
making your touch targets bigger making

393
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:24,690
sure there's enough separation between

394
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:27,570
links etc anything with a coarse pointer

395
00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:29,610
a touch device or if you're viewing it

396
00:15:29,610 --> 00:15:31,770
on a wiimote or you have using connect

397
00:15:31,770 --> 00:15:32,310
to

398
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:33,810
never get the internet or whatever

399
00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:36,000
they'll all work nicely breaking things

400
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,410
down by nice features rather than by

401
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:39,690
devices makes it automatically more

402
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:42,420
accessible to interesting devices on the

403
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:45,840
outskirts of your use cases there are a

404
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:49,380
bunch more in the spec for example

405
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:51,450
looking for the ability to animate you

406
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:53,130
can tell if your view being viewed on an

407
00:15:53,130 --> 00:15:55,170
e-ink device that can't animate very

408
00:15:55,170 --> 00:15:56,790
well it can change values but it can't

409
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:58,920
do constant gradations because it takes

410
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:00,450
too long to update the screen so you

411
00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:02,520
might scale down or drop your animations

412
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:04,920
in that case there's a bunch more in

413
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:07,890
their luminosity queries you can tell if

414
00:16:07,890 --> 00:16:09,839
the phone is being used at night and you

415
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:10,830
might want to use a different color

416
00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:12,120
scheme to prevent it from being old

417
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:14,370
brighten your eyes and if you have any

418
00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:17,430
other ideas for things that you need to

419
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:19,170
know in order to design your webpage

420
00:16:19,170 --> 00:16:21,270
appropriately responsively let us know

421
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:24,330
email us on dub dub dub style at w3.org

422
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:26,730
and tell us what it is you're trying to

423
00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:28,230
do and maybe we can craft a media query

424
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:33,600
for this some new things out of

425
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,670
animation who hears heard of the web

426
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:39,600
animation spec decent number not enough

427
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,460
all right everybody is homework look up

428
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:43,050
the web animation spec just google for

429
00:16:43,050 --> 00:16:45,630
it it's taking all the functionality and

430
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:48,660
ease of use of CSS animations and making

431
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:52,440
them useful in javascript using a syntax

432
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,540
pretty similar to jquery animation if

433
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:57,000
you're used to that gives you all the

434
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,430
hardware acceleration etc that you get

435
00:16:59,430 --> 00:17:01,260
from using a CSS animation for certain

436
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:03,150
properties but rather than having to

437
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:06,240
deal with strings and the crap that you

438
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,650
have to do right now to try to use

439
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:09,839
performance CSS animations you just say

440
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:11,970
element animate food to bar it's very

441
00:17:11,970 --> 00:17:15,030
simple another very interesting one

442
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:16,230
again if you're following the slides you

443
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:18,179
just click that link is the new motion

444
00:17:18,179 --> 00:17:20,189
property that was recently proposed and

445
00:17:20,189 --> 00:17:23,459
being implemented in Chrome and Safari

446
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:26,939
right now SVG has always had a nice way

447
00:17:26,939 --> 00:17:28,740
to animate something around a page two

448
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:31,110
dimensionally you can technically do

449
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:33,060
that yourself just by using transform X

450
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:35,220
and transform why but it's ridiculously

451
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,420
difficult it's not something that you

452
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:37,950
could actually do by hand unless you're

453
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:39,270
doing the simplest of things straight

454
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:41,400
lines maybe some diagonals you don't do

455
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,929
a curve around and try to set that up

456
00:17:42,929 --> 00:17:45,090
with easing functions on the x and y you

457
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:45,929
can't do that with you

458
00:17:45,929 --> 00:17:47,580
means computers can do it for you but

459
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:49,830
it's terrible motion path just lets you

460
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:51,809
specify the path you want to do using

461
00:17:51,809 --> 00:17:55,470
the SVG path syntax and then you just

462
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:57,210
tell the element I want you to be at

463
00:17:57,210 --> 00:17:58,740
this position and animate over to this

464
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:00,299
position and it will follow the path for

465
00:18:00,299 --> 00:18:05,909
you automatically and finally we come to

466
00:18:05,909 --> 00:18:09,119
the real future of CSS what I've talked

467
00:18:09,119 --> 00:18:10,590
about before are features that are

468
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:12,480
coming up in the near future the medium

469
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,830
future things that we're giving you

470
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:16,950
Polly filling CSS is where sees us we'll

471
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:20,490
end up with you giving things to us no

472
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:24,629
language can grow forever it CSS is

473
00:18:24,629 --> 00:18:26,220
already an enormous language we have

474
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:28,169
over 400 properties and memorizing

475
00:18:28,169 --> 00:18:30,090
everything is ridiculously difficult and

476
00:18:30,090 --> 00:18:31,889
we're only getting larger every day we

477
00:18:31,889 --> 00:18:35,549
add something new the cycle time between

478
00:18:35,549 --> 00:18:38,369
us finding a need in us creating a spec

479
00:18:38,369 --> 00:18:40,019
and then it being implemented and then

480
00:18:40,019 --> 00:18:42,149
it being usefully implemented across

481
00:18:42,149 --> 00:18:44,519
enough devices for you to use on sites

482
00:18:44,519 --> 00:18:47,429
is too long flex boxes cycle time was

483
00:18:47,429 --> 00:18:49,350
about 5 years and that's not a typical

484
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:51,389
it's pretty normal there and that's

485
00:18:51,389 --> 00:18:52,950
ridiculous we can't deal with a

486
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:54,899
five-year cycle time between I have an

487
00:18:54,899 --> 00:18:58,830
idea I can use the idea on a website so

488
00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:01,529
there's a lot of places where we can

489
00:19:01,529 --> 00:19:04,590
open up CSS to poly filling to

490
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:07,320
JavaScript based approaches that still

491
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:09,389
hook into low-level browser primitives

492
00:19:09,389 --> 00:19:11,909
the things that CSS is affecting in the

493
00:19:11,909 --> 00:19:14,519
first place but let you tailor things to

494
00:19:14,519 --> 00:19:18,090
your own solution one simple example

495
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:19,559
probably one of the first that will show

496
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:21,749
up is poly filling media queries I'm

497
00:19:21,749 --> 00:19:26,850
going to start with a wrong thing doop

498
00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:32,220
doop doop starting with a sea thing oh I

499
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:33,990
can get that all right cool small screen

500
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:36,990
too small for me creating custom media

501
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:38,610
queries just to give names this is more

502
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:40,889
or less variables for media queries if

503
00:19:40,889 --> 00:19:42,179
you'll notice as well i'm using a nice

504
00:19:42,179 --> 00:19:44,429
fun syntax 500 pixels less than or equal

505
00:19:44,429 --> 00:19:46,619
to width etc that's a new syntax and

506
00:19:46,619 --> 00:19:48,299
media queries because we never really

507
00:19:48,299 --> 00:19:50,220
wanted to do min-width and max with it's

508
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:52,049
a little bit confusing we always wanted

509
00:19:52,049 --> 00:19:54,330
a nice relationship operators like

510
00:19:54,330 --> 00:19:57,080
you're used to a normal programming but

511
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:59,370
10-15 years ago when this was first in

512
00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:02,970
to XML was harder to work with nowadays

513
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:04,590
we don't care we can use less than and

514
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:07,200
greater than signs pretty freely so

515
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,960
that's fine so this just gives a name to

516
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:13,170
a longer media query you can you make

517
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:14,700
one that's just for a small screen for

518
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:16,590
example that has that maybe some other

519
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:18,240
media queries stacked on give it a nice

520
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,680
short name use that throughout your

521
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,480
document again so you don't repeat

522
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:25,410
yourself also the script based syntax

523
00:20:25,410 --> 00:20:27,240
for this lets you do more advanced

524
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:29,460
things you want to how many people use

525
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:32,970
moderniser so moderniser works by

526
00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:35,280
setting classes on the body this means

527
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,140
though that you have to use a relatively

528
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:39,660
inefficient selector to style off of

529
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:42,990
this doing body dot animation or

530
00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:45,000
whatever does and then a descendant

531
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,790
selector relatively slow instead that

532
00:20:47,790 --> 00:20:49,770
kind of thing could be set up as media

533
00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:51,660
queries which don't require searching

534
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:54,179
over the document for it set up true or

535
00:20:54,179 --> 00:20:55,890
false set up new values for what you

536
00:20:55,890 --> 00:20:58,710
want if you're using some new API on the

537
00:20:58,710 --> 00:21:01,800
web on some mobile device that isn't

538
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,540
exposed into CSS yet but you want to

539
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:04,920
style your page based on that you can

540
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,929
set up a custom media query for that

541
00:21:06,929 --> 00:21:08,309
with whatever values you want and you

542
00:21:08,309 --> 00:21:10,170
just use them in your page like any

543
00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:14,610
other media query would there's a bunch

544
00:21:14,610 --> 00:21:17,850
more that we could do here to a basic

545
00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:19,770
list here the most important one though

546
00:21:19,770 --> 00:21:21,929
is down at number five custom layout

547
00:21:21,929 --> 00:21:23,910
that's one of the things that has the

548
00:21:23,910 --> 00:21:26,070
longest cycle time right now I said flex

549
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:27,960
boxes have been a five-year cycle time

550
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:30,809
from me starting to work on it to it

551
00:21:30,809 --> 00:21:33,090
being usable across everywhere and

552
00:21:33,090 --> 00:21:35,490
that's only because I started from a

553
00:21:35,490 --> 00:21:36,929
spec that already kind of existed

554
00:21:36,929 --> 00:21:38,309
everybody already recognized it was

555
00:21:38,309 --> 00:21:40,890
useful grid has a similar cycle time a

556
00:21:40,890 --> 00:21:42,480
lot of ideas are smaller than this but

557
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,100
layout just takes a long time it's

558
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:46,410
extremely complicated to get right when

559
00:21:46,410 --> 00:21:49,520
you're trying to design forever so

560
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:52,320
recently I was in Sydney for a week with

561
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,450
the chrome team down there and we spent

562
00:21:54,450 --> 00:21:56,040
the entire week talking about how we

563
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:58,170
could make layout customizable very

564
00:21:58,170 --> 00:21:59,370
difficult because it's very perf

565
00:21:59,370 --> 00:22:01,290
sensitive it's very easy to slow down

566
00:22:01,290 --> 00:22:03,570
the entire page if you don't do things

567
00:22:03,570 --> 00:22:05,220
carefully we think we have some

568
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:06,630
solutions for this and we're getting

569
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:08,910
together with other browser vendors our

570
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:11,000
next meeting in February will be with

571
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,170
Firefox ie

572
00:22:13,170 --> 00:22:16,140
in Safari to talk about exactly how we

573
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:18,870
want to design a custom layout system

574
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:21,180
that lets JavaScript create layouts that

575
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:24,030
respond well to CSS because of course

576
00:22:24,030 --> 00:22:25,230
you can create layouts yourself right

577
00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:26,940
now you have JavaScript drives some

578
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:29,430
absolute positioning etc but you're

579
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:31,860
stuck with the container being usually

580
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:35,730
fixed size because CSS when it asks hey

581
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:38,550
what size are you you can't respond well

582
00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:40,400
you have to just give a definite answer

583
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:43,590
this kind of thing will make custom

584
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:46,110
layouts work well within CSS and make it

585
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:48,780
much easier to say I want something like

586
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:50,340
flexbox but a little bit different

587
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:52,680
details just go write it yourself or get

588
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:54,630
someone else to write it for you rather

589
00:22:54,630 --> 00:22:56,220
and then if it's a really good idea

590
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:58,200
afterwards we can come along pick it up

591
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,310
look really smart because we're

592
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:02,580
designing something great but you don't

593
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:04,050
have to wait for us to do it first

594
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:05,820
there's no more asking permission and

595
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:08,580
that's the big ideal here just letting

596
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:11,160
y'all all of y'all in this room and

597
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:15,390
outside work on the web in CSS the same

598
00:23:15,390 --> 00:23:16,860
way you do with JavaScript the same way

599
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:18,980
you do with preprocessors etc and

600
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:24,330
continue on there so that's the end I

601
00:23:24,330 --> 00:23:25,950
think it's probably time if we do have

602
00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:27,240
any time I can take questions but I

603
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,590
don't know if this is a question e-type

604
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:30,690
place all right cool no questions talk
