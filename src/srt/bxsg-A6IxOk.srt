1
00:00:09,429 --> 00:00:11,540

so about the

2
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:14,540
it's a silly way that I heard of when I

3
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:18,950
stopped start working on marketing and I

4
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:21,680
created different landing pages and only

5
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,360
done in benches people who are saying

6
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:25,540
like all the important information

7
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:28,759
should be above the fold which means the

8
00:00:28,759 --> 00:00:32,180
user data scroll and all the extras

9
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:35,840
should be below so that meant for

10
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,540
marketing that if we want the user to

11
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:41,870
convert that means to fill a forum on

12
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:44,600
something like that then we must put the

13
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:47,570
form above everything an old information

14
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:50,450
below and honestly for me that didn't

15
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:52,910
make any sense because if the usual

16
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:55,520
dozen read what we are sailing we cannot

17
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,570
asked him over here to fill out the form

18
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:04,280
so i don't agree with the theory and I

19
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:05,810
don't know if you are with me who

20
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:08,630
doesn't agree with the theory you have

21
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:10,850
some people some people again not many

22
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:14,750
but I'm going to prove it wrong so and

23
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:17,330
let's chicken and then Wikipedia

24
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:20,390
Wikipedia we have a scroll through with

25
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:23,420
video or of our lives I mean high school

26
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:27,470
is full of it we scroll we know that we

27
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:30,409
scroll and then let's check out this

28
00:01:30,409 --> 00:01:33,320
website which we all know about this

29
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:36,500
tray is khan website and according to

30
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:39,080
the above default theory this website

31
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:42,530
should be a massive fail because the

32
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:45,200
form is below the fold but on the other

33
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,040
hand it has sold out so what what's the

34
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,250
key point in this why did it work well

35
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:54,909
they engage the user basically

36
00:01:54,909 --> 00:01:58,939
information and other stuff like the

37
00:01:58,939 --> 00:02:03,080
terminal the countdown the other

38
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:07,040
countdown in the workshops again I mean

39
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,470
why did they put game in there I don't

40
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:12,200
know they just say I'm going to put a

41
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,810
game in there and it wasn't pretty well

42
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:17,150
it didn't make any sense I didn't have

43
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:19,280
to put a game in there but they engage

44
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,660
the user and

45
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:23,550
gonna spend like 30 minutes in this

46
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:26,220
website without getting bored and really

47
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:29,340
bad at it but some people may be better

48
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:34,170
and the nyan cat is like hidden in the

49
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:38,490
planetarium and then the suspicious

50
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:41,340
octopus another thing at the bottom of

51
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:44,940
the page that again it gives the

52
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:47,340
sensation of I want to keep scrolling

53
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:51,030
because I want to discover more stuff so

54
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:53,790
yeah if they ought to boost has nothing

55
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:56,580
to do with say yes maybe but it's

56
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:58,890
something else that you can add to the

57
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:02,820
website so for me really the about four

58
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:05,940
theories nothing man excuse for lazy web

59
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:08,880
design it's like I don't have much time

60
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,980
to do this I'm just gonna put the forum

61
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:14,430
over there and hope to the users to fill

62
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:17,550
out the form but now if you really put

63
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:20,490
and love into it you can make this

64
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:22,740
awesome website that the shades Khan has

65
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:27,000
made and then Troy us to paradox by whom

66
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,130
what has parallax to do with the

67
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:31,950
waterfall well parallax means scrolling

68
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:34,890
so if the user doesn't scroll he will

69
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:37,590
never enjoy parallax but parallax is a

70
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:40,560
wave of engaging the user while he or

71
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,340
she rolls so a current Wikipedia

72
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:46,350
parallax it's like moving the hbu port

73
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:48,840
which will be us but we are not really

74
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:51,330
moving we are giving the sensation of

75
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:55,350
the user moving so this trend when

76
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:58,980
design began with nike website in 2011

77
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:02,190
and it means moving different elements

78
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:04,980
in different layers along with scroll

79
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:07,080
base that means the user Scrolls an

80
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:10,140
element's move and this has the

81
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:12,360
sensation of perspective and depth that

82
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:16,620
you cannot give in any other way so how

83
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:19,739
do you do parallax in web design this

84
00:04:19,739 --> 00:04:22,980
was one of the challenges when I started

85
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:25,560
with this talk there are so many ways of

86
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:29,880
playing parallax and I found for which

87
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:32,610
were like the best one is using jQuery

88
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:34,350
the other one is Suzanne

89
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:37,650
library CSS or something called pillar

90
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:40,950
which is not really parallax well I'm

91
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:44,310
option one is shake weary and let's

92
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:48,360
imagine we have this improper thing with

93
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:52,050
an image Powerpuff Girls and son info

94
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:58,800
about that we add some CSS to it what's

95
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,980
important about the CSS is that you must

96
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:04,710
generate overflow because without

97
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:07,110
overflow parallax really doesn't work

98
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:11,460
and then info which is this red thing

99
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:14,610
about and must be relative if it's not

100
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:18,470
relative then you will have this problem

101
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:22,680
that when you apply parallax the image

102
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,810
will cover the text and you will be able

103
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:28,260
to read it so they the info must be

104
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:31,950
relative or absolute in must have some

105
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:36,480
see index applied to it so and again we

106
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:40,650
must have this info element which is all

107
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:43,110
the information relative and wiped out

108
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:46,830
when we apply parallax in this in this

109
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:50,400
form we will apply it through transform

110
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,890
property it's a CSS turn for property

111
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:57,330
and we're not really telling the image

112
00:05:57,330 --> 00:06:00,330
to be relative or absolute or fixed so

113
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:04,260
why does it cover the text well because

114
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:09,000
the transform property and create the

115
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,770
hips like position relative when Tim it

116
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:12,870
means that grace and us talking context

117
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:16,200
so that means its original space is

118
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:20,100
still occupied but with it this newest

119
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:23,580
talking context and it activates the see

120
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:26,850
index so even though the image is still

121
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:29,340
a static when we apply transform

122
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:31,500
property to it it's al aliy wicka wicka

123
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:35,910
and becomes relative it's a strange but

124
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:40,080
it does so info must be relative a list

125
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:44,790
or have AC index so when we have the CSS

126
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:46,680
then we apply some shake wearing any

127
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,969
version of jQuery

128
00:06:47,969 --> 00:06:50,819
will do and then we write some jQuery

129
00:06:50,819 --> 00:06:53,879
it's not that easier so this is one way

130
00:06:53,879 --> 00:06:56,159
of doing battle axe Russia query which

131
00:06:56,159 --> 00:06:58,739
is calling the scroll function on rapper

132
00:06:58,739 --> 00:07:02,849
and inside that you call for a scroll

133
00:07:02,849 --> 00:07:04,739
tube a scroll job is a function that

134
00:07:04,739 --> 00:07:07,619
returns how many pixels has the user

135
00:07:07,619 --> 00:07:12,179
scroll like 30-50 that so we create

136
00:07:12,179 --> 00:07:15,599
something like this mmm that means we

137
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:18,659
ask for scroll top and we save that into

138
00:07:18,659 --> 00:07:21,389
distance and then we tell the image

139
00:07:21,389 --> 00:07:23,610
inside wrapper which is the Powerpuff

140
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:27,360
Girls to translate y half of the

141
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,059
distance that the rest of the content

142
00:07:30,059 --> 00:07:35,549
and that as a result gives this so as

143
00:07:35,549 --> 00:07:37,979
you can see the image Scrolls at a

144
00:07:37,979 --> 00:07:39,719
different pace than the rest of the

145
00:07:39,719 --> 00:07:44,969
content so yeah that's really all so

146
00:07:44,969 --> 00:07:47,969
then we can apply a negative value just

147
00:07:47,969 --> 00:07:51,479
a dash and we can make the image go up

148
00:07:51,479 --> 00:07:56,309
as if it isn't working but and the image

149
00:07:56,309 --> 00:08:00,089
goes up imagine something will fail so

150
00:08:00,089 --> 00:08:02,909
yes it's often but there's a little

151
00:08:02,909 --> 00:08:05,729
problem is that a scroll function

152
00:08:05,729 --> 00:08:08,279
doesn't have really well performance I

153
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:11,579
mean if we are applying it's only to one

154
00:08:11,579 --> 00:08:14,819
image inside of website is ok but if we

155
00:08:14,819 --> 00:08:17,549
want to do everything with a scroll

156
00:08:17,549 --> 00:08:19,499
function then we have a performance

157
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:23,189
problem so the right thing will be used

158
00:08:23,189 --> 00:08:25,679
for qwest animation frame but you have

159
00:08:25,679 --> 00:08:28,499
to break like a lot of JavaScript and we

160
00:08:28,499 --> 00:08:31,169
have weird shapes from we have a lot of

161
00:08:31,169 --> 00:08:34,079
JavaScript not really so I go for option

162
00:08:34,079 --> 00:08:37,740
to rush up to our libraries well there

163
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:39,899
are many as four magic peril Akshay's

164
00:08:39,899 --> 00:08:43,979
scroller and many more I go for scroller

165
00:08:43,979 --> 00:08:47,189
what's interesting about it and you

166
00:08:47,189 --> 00:08:49,529
don't require shake wary you don't need

167
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:51,420
to be an expert in JavaScript that's

168
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:53,130
awesome for me

169
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:54,780
and its massive realizing something

170
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:57,270
called data attributes data attributes

171
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:59,850
are attributes that you apply to the

172
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:03,780
element you want to transform and you

173
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:07,830
simply in provide an encore inside the

174
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:10,350
website when the element reaches does

175
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:12,960
that anchor the animation triggers it's

176
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,520
something like this let's imagine we

177
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:17,250
have a proper with information something

178
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:20,960
called move move along with this wording

179
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:24,630
circle and the more information we call

180
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:28,740
a scroller we initiate it and then we

181
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:31,910
have something like this if we apply

182
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:37,280
this thing so what is going on here well

183
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:41,580
we indicate this to and data attributes

184
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:43,710
one if data top and the other one data

185
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:46,650
button on that atop we tell the element

186
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:49,290
to be rather and rotate 360 degrees

187
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:52,050
which means more round and then that's

188
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:54,870
about on we tell it to be blue and not

189
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:58,350
to be rotated so data top applies and

190
00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:00,840
triggers when the element reaches the

191
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:03,090
top of the page that's why we see it red

192
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:07,410
and the data bottom attributes applies

193
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:10,230
when we reach is the bottom of the page

194
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:13,260
so that's basically where we apply these

195
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:16,620
data attributes on the the anchors and

196
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:19,050
the animation three years when that

197
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:22,260
element which is that point something

198
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:24,360
like this you apply to an element when

199
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:26,850
the element which is that point it turns

200
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:29,880
to what we say and there are a lot of

201
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:33,000
data with tribute this is actually from

202
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,420
the github page of a scroller you have

203
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:42,120
all this and to like a cheat sheet you

204
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:47,940
can apply any kind of CSS to it because

205
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:54,030
it actually depends on CSS so any kind

206
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:57,920
of CSS you can apply there it will work

207
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:01,290
then and what if we want faster parallax

208
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:03,120
well

209
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,910
and we can just avoid a script because

210
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:09,240
we hate JavaScript or because just you

211
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,339
you don't want to bright JavaScript and

212
00:11:11,339 --> 00:11:13,470
you will be able to create a faster but

213
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:16,320
lacks and that's option free which is

214
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:20,700
using CSS and only CSS and what's great

215
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:23,339
about doing paralysis you don't need to

216
00:11:23,339 --> 00:11:26,070
worry you don't need JavaScript really

217
00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:27,960
you don't need anything about it's pure

218
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:34,560
CSS here are here's some one of the

219
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:44,460
examples there and so we can see this

220
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:47,610
has this parallax effects effect on it

221
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:50,130
and it's only CSS is pure CSS do you

222
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:52,920
don't worry javascript jquery or you

223
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:55,920
don't need anything else bad CSS and

224
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:59,010
what you need to do this is actually use

225
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:02,550
perspective property in CSS that means

226
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:04,589
that suddenly Internet Explorer 10

227
00:12:04,589 --> 00:12:07,709
doesn't read it but in the future it

228
00:12:07,709 --> 00:12:14,010
will and this is another example we cssm

229
00:12:14,010 --> 00:12:17,190
parallax this example is from scott

230
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:21,180
calhoun he created SS mixing in order

231
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:24,120
for every one of us to to have it easier

232
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:26,820
when we do parallax with the SS so you

233
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:31,680
can check this one out as well and then

234
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,500
another great example if this one that

235
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,990
comes with an article explaining and

236
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:41,010
step-by-step how to do this and it

237
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:42,330
worked like this you have those

238
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:44,730
different layers and as you scroll all

239
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:47,190
those layers are going one below the

240
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:49,770
other and it gives again the sensation

241
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:51,690
of reflective you because you are

242
00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:58,490
actually using perspective in CSS

243
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:01,780
then this there's option for in case you

244
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:04,030
don't get along with CSS or you don't

245
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:06,490
get along with parallax in JavaScript or

246
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:09,430
you you just don't want to write one

247
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:11,920
line of code which is something called

248
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:15,640
Peter well Peter is not really parallax

249
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:18,670
is something called bigger so sometimes

250
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:21,070
it is confused like parallax that is not

251
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:25,060
parallax and it comes with well she is

252
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:28,690
it's a small thing only three claw bites

253
00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:31,000
and he has many options for the

254
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,880
animations like the duration the delay

255
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:37,650
the duration many other cool stuff and

256
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:40,540
the only problem is that once you play

257
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:43,660
it you cannot replay it that's the

258
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:45,520
difference with paradox when I do

259
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:47,350
parallax when I scroll to the top again

260
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:51,010
the animations go again not here the

261
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:52,720
animation only triggers when the page

262
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,480
loads when the user Scrolls for the

263
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:58,150
first time but then everything remains

264
00:13:58,150 --> 00:14:00,550
like that and it's actually what the

265
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:04,600
shyest conf website uses so it goes with

266
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:07,180
animation CSS which is something like

267
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:11,350
this and you pick animation like bounce

268
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:14,800
in up system working but you can check

269
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:20,830
it out a cure hmm well can't you get a

270
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:25,600
layer it works and then you are these

271
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,810
thing with cheese and well she is with

272
00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:33,450
some brown loading images but what is

273
00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:36,310
something like this and full of comic

274
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:40,120
sans and all that and yes it doesn't

275
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:42,520
require shake wearing or JavaScript nor

276
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:46,810
any kind of code you can create this ma

277
00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:50,710
this Peter effects which is basically

278
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:53,890
this it's what the shades can we use is

279
00:14:53,890 --> 00:14:55,330
when all the things appear out of

280
00:14:55,330 --> 00:14:58,090
nowhere and as you can see as I scroll

281
00:14:58,090 --> 00:15:01,330
the animations trigger but the only

282
00:15:01,330 --> 00:15:04,270
problem is as I scroll back again the

283
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:05,950
animations don't we go again that's

284
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:07,840
different with parallax and it doesn't

285
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,430
give the sensation of perspective

286
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:11,320
because there is known perspective in

287
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:14,320
this but you don't write a line of code

288
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:19,210
in JavaScript or CSS additional so Oh

289
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:22,170
what our final recommendations for

290
00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:26,459
parallax well first of all and

291
00:15:26,459 --> 00:15:29,589
responsive first then animations them

292
00:15:29,589 --> 00:15:32,110
parallax than everything when you apply

293
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:35,760
parallax to a website you destroy the

294
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:38,110
the organization and the flow of the

295
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:40,149
content because you begin creating

296
00:15:40,149 --> 00:15:43,180
relative absolute and fixed elements and

297
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:46,060
everything's closed crazy so if you

298
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:47,860
apply parallax before making your web

299
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:51,070
site for mobile or responsive then at

300
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:52,570
the time you want you to make you want

301
00:15:52,570 --> 00:15:54,670
to make it responsive you go Gracie

302
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:56,649
because I or the whole of your website

303
00:15:56,649 --> 00:15:59,649
is kind of weird so make responsive

304
00:15:59,649 --> 00:16:01,839
first and then up the animation of the

305
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:06,250
parallax but parallax and especially a

306
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:07,990
scroller doesn't work really well

307
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:10,720
neither on mobile devices and on touch

308
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,510
devices what can you do about it you can

309
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:17,560
turn it off with inquiries or and you

310
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,630
can use moderniser to turn it off on

311
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:22,570
touchscreens yes because touch screens

312
00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:24,970
and parallax and especially scroller

313
00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:27,660
like don't get along really well and

314
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:29,920
what else it's better to animate

315
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:32,160
transform property and opacity

316
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:35,800
transforming in scale askew rotate and

317
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:38,709
translate because those are cheaper and

318
00:16:38,709 --> 00:16:40,180
they were better they have better

319
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:43,750
performance and opacity as well and if

320
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:45,730
you want to animate colors you cannot

321
00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:49,660
use Excel SML and because you cannot go

322
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:53,050
through an f 20 there's no transition

323
00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:55,510
between them you have to use our cpa or

324
00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:59,350
hsl and simply because you can go

325
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:03,880
through 255 20 but no from f20 it

326
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:07,720
doesn't work that is simple changing the

327
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:10,750
mode the color mode and don't go crazy

328
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:12,970
over absolute position in because

329
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:14,890
there's this idea that I have two

330
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:17,260
absolution everything and

331
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:19,570
it's not really necessary because once

332
00:17:19,570 --> 00:17:21,640
you apply transform the element will

333
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:24,850
have as the index and you can apply

334
00:17:24,850 --> 00:17:27,550
relative the only problem with up to the

335
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:30,310
positioning it does is really like the

336
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:32,800
black sheep of the family because it's

337
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:37,300
and just like a rebellion in it and it

338
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:39,910
does whatever you wants so you have to

339
00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:41,980
be certain that you can handle a lot of

340
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:44,980
absolute elements otherwise i recommend

341
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:48,130
you to go for a relative or fixed

342
00:17:48,130 --> 00:17:51,250
elements but on the other hand absolute

343
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:53,320
and fitch have better performance than

344
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:56,890
relative so you can like go from one on

345
00:17:56,890 --> 00:18:02,440
the order so and go soon and choose the

346
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:03,760
best implementation according to your

347
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:06,400
project needs simply there are thousand

348
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:09,010
ways of doing parallax and nobody's

349
00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:10,780
going to tell you anything is you use

350
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:13,510
pillar instead of writing hundred lines

351
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:16,120
of JavaScript or if you use a library

352
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:19,480
and you don't use pillar whatever is

353
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:24,160
great for your project use it and please

354
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:27,490
try to keep keep a clean HTML because I

355
00:18:27,490 --> 00:18:29,650
seen horrible things and I'm one of

356
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:33,640
those semantics crazy people so yeah try

357
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:37,540
to keep keep it clean okay well thank
