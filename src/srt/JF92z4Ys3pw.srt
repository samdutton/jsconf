1
00:00:07,069 --> 00:00:18,400

hello and welcome to my very first talk

2
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:20,970
yeah it's named embrace a project

3
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:23,880
animation with concepts and yeah that's

4
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:28,680
me never see my face this big and maybe

5
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:31,650
I should stick to the microphone so I'm

6
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:34,320
care scene developer at some kuhmo here

7
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,950
in Hamburg and my twitter name is busier

8
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:41,600
Dave because I love Bezier curves and

9
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:46,950
yeah I'm a former character animator

10
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:50,550
I've been working as a freelancer for

11
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:53,640
about seven years and it's I'm sorry

12
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:56,039
body in character animation and other

13
00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:59,640
things and now since ten years I'm a

14
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:03,870
front-end developer yeah so let's get

15
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:06,900
started and I hope you can see me is

16
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:10,979
pretty high here yeah I have a question

17
00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:14,760
for all of you did you ever have one of

18
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:20,119
the following web experiences loss of

19
00:01:20,119 --> 00:01:27,659
orientation increasing frustration or

20
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:35,159
maybe loss of trust I think you had so

21
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:44,020
how did it come to those feelings

22
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:56,690
think about it maybe your cognitive load

23
00:01:56,690 --> 00:02:03,990
became too high could be so cognitive

24
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:06,020
load was it what is that

25
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:16,290
I've got a seat at well thank you I've

26
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:18,870
got a quote the total amount of mental

27
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:21,870
effort that is required to complete a

28
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:27,310
task involving processing of information

29
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:31,200
so animation can fill the gap between

30
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,330
viewing and understanding

31
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:36,530
that's what's happening if you have

32
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:40,980
overload there's a gap and you have to

33
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:47,459
fix it oh yeah I'm first hark so look at

34
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:49,530
this this animation on the left-hand

35
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:52,709
side you can see someone going from home

36
00:02:52,709 --> 00:02:59,370
to contact hmm well pretty snappy where

37
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:03,170
are you on the side what about this here

38
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:06,180
wow I know where I am that's pretty cool

39
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:10,650
and look animation so maybe it's simple

40
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:11,459
as that huh

41
00:03:11,459 --> 00:03:15,720
what do you want closing the gap how do

42
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:20,010
we do that we take animation so what do

43
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:25,060
we want to animate yes

44
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:29,629
so let's animate everything yeah let's

45
00:03:29,629 --> 00:03:35,599
take some time let's animate tiles

46
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:39,290
let's any make some burger menus let's

47
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:42,290
animate some accordions looks like fun

48
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:46,400
okay let's do that so be brave and go

49
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,680
for it

50
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,409
I've got an example over here I didn't

51
00:03:51,409 --> 00:03:57,650
do that that's my pretty cruel yeah so

52
00:03:57,650 --> 00:04:01,310
where am I here well let's see I want to

53
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:06,530
go Oh what oh no no no no that was just

54
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:08,739
want to skip that okay I go there Oh

55
00:04:08,739 --> 00:04:12,440
finally whoa so let's get some

56
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:14,959
information about that side oh oh now

57
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:16,780
where am I

58
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:23,840
where when am i I can reach to them

59
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:27,320
that's fine okay thanks whoa so where

60
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:30,530
was that start page I don't know I'm

61
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:39,110
lost I'm frustrated so how do I get back

62
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:45,740
to my I'm pretty lost okay here I am I

63
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:51,610
have sir okay just relax so wait what

64
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:57,610
what what just happened here hmm

65
00:04:57,610 --> 00:05:01,280
overacting elements everywhere we've

66
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,479
been animating everything beyond so I

67
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:07,479
got a suggestion for you what about

68
00:05:07,479 --> 00:05:14,810
animating with concept so but what you

69
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:21,530
need to know first is natural movements

70
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:27,550
give comfort they don't pop in okay and

71
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:31,850
they have weights

72
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:39,710
I had to do that so and there are 12

73
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:41,830
principles of animation

74
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:45,800
let me show them to you it's by Sarah

75
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,500
villains coma

76
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:55,070
Wow there are so many like easing I can

77
00:05:55,070 --> 00:06:03,890
show you some easing it's like it's like

78
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:08,120
eating in and out what I just did was a

79
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:10,430
transform and transformation as was

80
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:12,380
going from the left side to the neck to

81
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:18,640
the right side from my side and yeah and

82
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:22,160
you need a minimum two poses and one

83
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,010
tween between is all the movement

84
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:26,900
between two poses

85
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:31,310
it's a tween so like this here or if I

86
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:37,040
do this unless opposes this but how did

87
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:42,830
I get there maybe like this or maybe

88
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:51,440
like that so I will represent to you the

89
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:56,510
animation superpowers they make context

90
00:06:56,510 --> 00:07:02,510
clear they display hierarchies you can

91
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:05,090
see okay which element is the hero of

92
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:09,790
the day who's the sidekick and they make

93
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:18,350
the usage in in to it for me yeah I did

94
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:19,310
it okay

95
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:22,340
intuitive I say that every day from now

96
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:26,990
on so and they can make artificial

97
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:30,290
shortening of waiting time pretty good

98
00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:34,890
for da jman maybe and yeah

99
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:43,850
and movement animation should be natural

100
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:48,490
predictable and comprehensive to our

101
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:53,280
users for a better user experience and

102
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:57,130
what else can you do you could maybe

103
00:07:57,130 --> 00:08:00,320
create a mindmap

104
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:04,180
guess what you already have a lot of

105
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:07,600
them every one of you has several mind

106
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:11,620
maps so let's make an experiment and you

107
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:13,240
can close your eyes you can keep them

108
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:15,790
open as you like you can listen to my

109
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:22,420
soft voice think about your home think

110
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:25,590
about your favorite mug

111
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:30,640
where do you store it and how do you get

112
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:43,470
access to it so users need a mind map to

113
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:46,450
about your project and now I have to

114
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:51,670
drink something I really have it's not

115
00:08:51,670 --> 00:09:11,410
joke and breathe okay so with a mind map

116
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:16,110
you have orientation for example and

117
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:18,550
next slide I have an example for you

118
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:22,480
from a project of mine I would like to

119
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,400
show it to you in the browser but

120
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:28,060
unfortunately it's not going live this

121
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:32,230
week maybe a Monday and so here we go

122
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:37,170
I had this from from the designer and

123
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:41,080
she said okay what you see above there

124
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:45,150
oh wait

125
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:46,959
spoiling

126
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:49,089
and what you see above there should be

127
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:51,819
the first state and what you see below

128
00:09:51,819 --> 00:09:55,470
is the last date and I was like oh okay

129
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:59,949
when I press here this and this

130
00:09:59,949 --> 00:10:05,019
disappears and what you have here these

131
00:10:05,019 --> 00:10:08,649
two they go there okay

132
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:14,019
and this one goes to the X down there I

133
00:10:14,019 --> 00:10:17,199
don't have an arrow I forgot that one so

134
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:20,889
oh no I'm just looking at my forward ok

135
00:10:20,889 --> 00:10:25,389
I'd do it again I didn't it's not the

136
00:10:25,389 --> 00:10:28,059
same as you see this I'm sorry for that

137
00:10:28,059 --> 00:10:31,959
so okay this is the button I will press

138
00:10:31,959 --> 00:10:35,709
here and this and this disappears okay

139
00:10:35,709 --> 00:10:40,920
and goes down there now you get it okay

140
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:46,470
better you X now so and almost like okay

141
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:50,740
how do we get there they look they don't

142
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:53,860
look the same and so different so

143
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:57,759
different so let me tell you about my

144
00:10:57,759 --> 00:11:04,569
story and the story it starts the secret

145
00:11:04,569 --> 00:11:12,129
I have to share now with all of you yeah

146
00:11:12,129 --> 00:11:19,150
I use pencils and paper

147
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:22,790
yeah great effect like if you got

148
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:27,470
shocked I had these cute animals so so

149
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:30,950
that's what I do I draw that's where I

150
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:35,740
come from drawing 2d and f10 3d and here

151
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:39,260
you can see my thoughts I had I was

152
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:41,030
drawing the first state and the last

153
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:43,820
date and I was thinking okay how do I

154
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:49,490
get from A to C hmm okay what do i what

155
00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:53,360
do I have to think about and I can show

156
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:58,760
you the result it's like this and I'd

157
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:01,850
like to explain to you what I thought

158
00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:06,680
why is the navigation up there going to

159
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:09,440
the right and not disappearing by by

160
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:14,330
opacity or something and yeah it's I

161
00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:15,950
would love to go there but the mic is

162
00:12:15,950 --> 00:12:22,540
here so it's that burger and magnifying

163
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:26,210
button which amplify that if you click

164
00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:29,120
on it you see all the menu down there

165
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:34,480
and the menu is hidden in those

166
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:40,190
navigation items too you see it expands

167
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:43,190
if you click on it is it expands below

168
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:45,110
I'm sorry I don't have that in a picture

169
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:47,090
you have to imagine just like your house

170
00:12:47,090 --> 00:12:52,070
and your cup and yeah for me logically

171
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:55,760
they have to move to the right into the

172
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:59,540
button because it's in there and then

173
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:04,760
it's it it expands down and yeah that's

174
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:06,800
why I could talk a little bit more about

175
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,990
that but now I'm too nervous about it so

176
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:10,880
I hope you got it

177
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:14,450
did you yeah thank you

178
00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:19,070
so I breathe again and we go so what did

179
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:21,020
i do - good get there I did some

180
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:26,300
prototyping and this is how this is how

181
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:28,190
it looks at the beginning it wasn't

182
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:31,670
about being fancy or stylish or just

183
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:32,750
looking like

184
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:35,450
the designer said no I just wanted to

185
00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:40,030
have a feeling is it right to make a

186
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:44,300
morphing the way I did it like this or

187
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:47,360
did it feel wrong and how does it feel

188
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:51,590
the timing when my navigation points are

189
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:55,970
moving what is right and when I finished

190
00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:59,200
with that I couldn't resist anymore and

191
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:04,310
I took the project and I analyzed

192
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:08,180
everything every single component yes

193
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:11,810
and I thought okay which component needs

194
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:14,530
animation which doesn't and which

195
00:14:14,530 --> 00:14:17,060
component needs what kind of animation

196
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:19,310
so which component needs some

197
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:22,190
transitions or a hover effect or a

198
00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:24,590
movement from A to Z or who's the hero

199
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:31,670
here so I had some principles I found in

200
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:33,530
the internet by a surveillance camera

201
00:14:33,530 --> 00:14:37,820
again and he says it's about micro

202
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:39,350
animation not the whole thing

203
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:41,300
it's micro just only a component

204
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:45,230
animating they have to be restrained and

205
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:47,480
narrator if they have to tell us sorry

206
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:49,970
that they have to be a reason why there

207
00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:53,510
is animation and if you do so just do a

208
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:55,760
single movement don't do it all

209
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:59,060
everything together make pauses

210
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:03,320
sometimes and animation won't save you

211
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:09,920
if if you get a design where the gap is

212
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,590
too big between the first state and the

213
00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:16,370
last state maybe just don't maybe just

214
00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:19,520
talk to them we have something else

215
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:23,120
please and if you have some little

216
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,040
details they can be opportunities to

217
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:29,000
raise up the user experience and just

218
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,160
like I said I got really

219
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:35,710
interdisciplinary and I was talking to

220
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:40,690
designers concept oh yeah I see

221
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:43,240
who's on which side I'm on both sides

222
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:45,970
and maybe I just show you the little

223
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:53,110
piggies again okay so where happened

224
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:56,170
okay I talked to everybody and and was

225
00:15:56,170 --> 00:15:59,649
like okay we're for example back end hey

226
00:15:59,649 --> 00:16:02,860
when do the information come when does

227
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:06,339
the data come do we have to make an

228
00:16:06,339 --> 00:16:11,800
artificial time thing so nobody realizes

229
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:14,920
that we are wasting time here or maybe

230
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:17,860
I've been asking they design it okay

231
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:19,779
this component it really doesn't fit

232
00:16:19,779 --> 00:16:23,019
with animation and I'm a front-end

233
00:16:23,019 --> 00:16:25,569
developer I developed it by myself but I

234
00:16:25,569 --> 00:16:28,060
if I wouldn't do that I would go to the

235
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:29,920
front and a developer and say hey come

236
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:34,019
on how do we how do we the animator and

237
00:16:34,019 --> 00:16:37,810
talking to everybody and I was asking

238
00:16:37,810 --> 00:16:39,810
the real questions who's the hero here

239
00:16:39,810 --> 00:16:43,449
not in my company but on paper in my

240
00:16:43,449 --> 00:16:47,199
project on that side which element has

241
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:50,170
to be the hero who's the sidekick yeah

242
00:16:50,170 --> 00:16:52,269
and that's what another example just

243
00:16:52,269 --> 00:16:55,660
going through all the elements I had and

244
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:59,610
exciting how they have to behave and how

245
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:02,199
does that fit in the whole project

246
00:17:02,199 --> 00:17:08,520
that's that's what a concept is about so

247
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:16,189
project benefits of animation concepts

248
00:17:16,199 --> 00:17:19,900
yeah they give more structure because

249
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:24,549
every animation has a meaning they you

250
00:17:24,549 --> 00:17:27,730
have a kind of usability testing by just

251
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:31,470
looking other hidden to bless others to

252
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:34,150
elements that look the same and note

253
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:36,880
that don't look the same but they do the

254
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:45,340
same thing they behave they behave

255
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:50,669
like twins but they are not if you look

256
00:17:50,669 --> 00:17:51,150
at them

257
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:54,929
okay so just kick one of them but you

258
00:17:54,929 --> 00:17:57,870
have to talk to everyone else before you

259
00:17:57,870 --> 00:18:01,020
do that and everything gets more organic

260
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:03,690
you have a more organic feeling it feels

261
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:08,429
more naturally and it's a user-centered

262
00:18:08,429 --> 00:18:12,660
way of development and you have more

263
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:15,440
interdisciplinary exchange that's great

264
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:19,200
so here are some developer pitfalls as

265
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:27,279
well because what great power you know

266
00:18:27,289 --> 00:18:28,799
performance performance performance

267
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:33,240
performance think about performance so

268
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:35,730
here's the critical rendering path I

269
00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:38,549
know I don't know if you heard of that

270
00:18:38,549 --> 00:18:41,610
but if you animate you can't an image

271
00:18:41,610 --> 00:18:44,669
all the properties because some are

272
00:18:44,669 --> 00:18:48,120
rendered before they like here I have

273
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:53,909
that no didn't want to spoil it

274
00:18:53,909 --> 00:19:01,049
I have to go there okay now that's app

275
00:19:01,049 --> 00:19:07,049
animate I'm just for Meetup and here you

276
00:19:07,049 --> 00:19:11,039
can see that's where we want to go we

277
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:13,400
want to animate things where the

278
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:18,980
properties here and the compositor

279
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:26,520
composite here not here not there not

280
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:29,880
there but you can check this out on code

281
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,640
pan yet there you have several

282
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:33,840
informations it's about performance

283
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:39,929
animation and so and if you wonder which

284
00:19:39,929 --> 00:19:42,419
properties are these to animate here

285
00:19:42,419 --> 00:19:44,429
there are I get another example for you

286
00:19:44,429 --> 00:19:51,780
oh man it's falling again okay here we

287
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:52,040
go

288
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:54,630
so you can go there and just see okay

289
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:55,550
it's trying

290
00:19:55,550 --> 00:19:59,650
translate X it's translates that scaling

291
00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:00,790
[Music]

292
00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:06,020
opacity rotation and translated Epsilon

293
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:07,760
and I got a little keyframe animation

294
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:14,290
for you here again there you go and

295
00:20:14,290 --> 00:20:18,820
reset okay that's my presentation again

296
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:25,250
here we go so I've been spoiling this if

297
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:30,290
you have basic animation like one two or

298
00:20:30,290 --> 00:20:33,080
maximum three elements you have to

299
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:36,880
coordinate with with each other just use

300
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:43,340
CSS if you go for more if you have to do

301
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:47,420
a complex animation like four five six I

302
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:51,220
don't know how many elements then I

303
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:57,250
would recommend you to use gzip they

304
00:20:57,250 --> 00:21:00,050
whatever you animate with your keyframe

305
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:04,870
animations every change you have to do

306
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:10,430
in CSS might take you hours and on gzip

307
00:21:10,430 --> 00:21:14,150
it takes you a few seconds so we can

308
00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:20,690
talk about that later and yeah and you

309
00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:23,330
also have some developer support what I

310
00:21:23,330 --> 00:21:28,460
did when I started to take my project

311
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:32,390
and just go through every senior element

312
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:36,260
I was wondering okay um how do we get

313
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:38,900
from here to there so I took Adobe XD

314
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:43,040
and make some made some prototyping and

315
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:45,200
it's great if you want to know okay

316
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:48,410
where do I come when I click here and

317
00:21:48,410 --> 00:21:54,140
where do I go next and yeah easy to

318
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:59,240
learn I think and then I started coding

319
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:02,510
on code pan my animations but I realized

320
00:22:02,510 --> 00:22:07,590
that after why you go so deep into that

321
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:09,570
it becomes a big and you lose all that

322
00:22:09,570 --> 00:22:13,340
time mm-hmm so how can I develop some

323
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:18,390
micro animations a bit faster then I had

324
00:22:18,390 --> 00:22:23,070
principal and principal is program which

325
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:26,760
on which you can upload your sketch

326
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:32,520
files and then make some cool animations

327
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:35,730
they have timings and so on and yeah

328
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:38,820
there are some pitfalls if you're

329
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:41,570
interested we can talk about that later

330
00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:46,020
how to handle principal and then I would

331
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:53,669
say go for it take your project look at

332
00:22:53,669 --> 00:22:57,510
all your elements which should have

333
00:22:57,510 --> 00:23:00,750
animations which not how does it feel to

334
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:03,419
be on your project hmm maybe it's all

335
00:23:03,419 --> 00:23:08,940
snappy could be and then I'd say embrace

336
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:17,560
your project thank you

337
00:23:17,570 --> 00:23:18,360
