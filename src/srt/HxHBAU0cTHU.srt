1
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:15,599

reject everyone I am Ashley and I am

2
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:17,670
from Queens actually a neighborhood

3
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:19,619
called Ridgewood two blocks over from

4
00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:21,510
Brooklyn I actually walked between the

5
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:24,689
border every day I have some slides here

6
00:00:24,689 --> 00:00:26,220
if you'd like to follow along I

7
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:27,750
recommend writing it down just because

8
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:30,539
I'm about to quote a lot of people and

9
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:32,730
so the reading list for this is well

10
00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:34,710
documented in the slides and I suggest

11
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:36,690
that you check it out

12
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:39,629
so yeah hi I'm a g-dubs you might know

13
00:00:39,629 --> 00:00:41,160
me from Twitter where I'm very prolific

14
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:43,290
I don't recommend you follow me

15
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:44,670
I always apologize when I hear that

16
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:49,530
happen so wouldn't do it so I'm from the

17
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:50,910
United States but I like to say that

18
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:53,039
these are more of my red white and blue

19
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:55,530
I took these pictures when I was in

20
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:57,300
cologne this is actually my second trip

21
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:59,789
to Germany this month which is pretty

22
00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:02,730
cool because I really really really like

23
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:05,090
it here oh this is something I treated

24
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:07,890
you guys are really awesome and I really

25
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:11,640
really dig it so yeah I am a software

26
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:14,340
engineer at the Mozilla Foundation and

27
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:15,869
you guys might have gone upstairs if you

28
00:01:15,869 --> 00:01:17,939
haven't check it out and at the end of

29
00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:20,280
this talk there's a chance that you

30
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,470
might be able to get some swag from them

31
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:23,909
they've got some really cool swag and I

32
00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:26,310
have some for you alright so at the

33
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:27,689
Mozilla Foundation a lot of people don't

34
00:01:27,689 --> 00:01:30,060
really know exactly what we do but the

35
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:31,860
way we talk about our mission is that we

36
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:35,040
want to foster universal open web

37
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,170
literacy and so that's kind of a

38
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:39,000
mouthful but the idea is that we really

39
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,259
want people to be ethical consumers and

40
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:45,450
creators on the web and that can be a

41
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:46,890
lot and I'm not going to really dive

42
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:48,960
into almost any of that but it's a cause

43
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,170
that's important to me instead what I'm

44
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:54,990
gonna say is for me this means I like to

45
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:58,680
think about thinking especially the type

46
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,479
of thinking that happens when people

47
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:03,390
write code and this kind of idea of mine

48
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:05,729
my goal leads me to do projects like

49
00:02:05,729 --> 00:02:08,369
this where I take the idea of how people

50
00:02:08,369 --> 00:02:10,349
take things apart and try and create new

51
00:02:10,349 --> 00:02:12,420
learning tools for them and you're gonna

52
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:13,590
hear throughout this

53
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:15,450
talk that I care a lot about learning

54
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:16,970
tools and I actually kind of think

55
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:21,900
everything is a learning tool so what's

56
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:23,790
my talk about who knows maybe we should

57
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:26,150
just talk about cows in space right

58
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:28,800
that's why you guys are here right to

59
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,799
hear about cousin space no all right

60
00:02:31,799 --> 00:02:33,720
well some people have talked about art

61
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,879
maybe we can talk about art this is some

62
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:38,000
cool art that I found on the Internet

63
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,440
full of cool art uh but yeah maybe maybe

64
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,739
we'll talk about JavaScript right

65
00:02:45,739 --> 00:02:49,280
JavaScript and maybe in more particular

66
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:55,079
we'll talk about es6 right yes six all

67
00:02:55,079 --> 00:02:57,120
right but what you're gonna find and

68
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,650
hopefully this doesn't disappoint you

69
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:00,750
but this talk is all about a lot more

70
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:03,870
than es6 and so I'm gonna start off by

71
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:06,140
talking about the idea of abstraction

72
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:07,620
all right

73
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:10,769
cows in space though maintain that so

74
00:03:10,769 --> 00:03:12,540
this wouldn't be a good talk if I didn't

75
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:15,150
quote Dijkstra right this is again a

76
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:17,370
good computer scientist would say and

77
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:19,709
here he defines abstraction he says the

78
00:03:19,709 --> 00:03:23,160
effective exploitation of his kind of a

79
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:25,799
bad pronoun let's say their prows of

80
00:03:25,799 --> 00:03:28,230
abstraction must be regarded as one of

81
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:30,510
the most vital activities of a competent

82
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:34,130
programmer I didn't turn my phone off

83
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:38,880
whoops all right so again what we're

84
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,680
seeing here right is that when we are

85
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,359
doing programming in its most

86
00:03:42,359 --> 00:03:48,150
fundamental we are abstracting so the

87
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:49,859
abstraction principle is defined by

88
00:03:49,859 --> 00:03:51,480
Benjamin C Pearson one of his most

89
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,639
foundational books called types and

90
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:55,260
programming languages and if you haven't

91
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:56,849
read it you should check it out but here

92
00:03:56,849 --> 00:03:58,799
he says each significant piece of

93
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:00,900
functionality in a program should be

94
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:03,000
implemented in just one place in the

95
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,549
source code where similar functions are

96
00:04:05,549 --> 00:04:07,590
carried out by distinct pieces of code

97
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:10,260
it is generally beneficial to combine

98
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:12,930
them into one by abstracting out the

99
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:14,400
varying parts and this should be

100
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,810
something that we're probably really

101
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:18,120
familiar with as developers for me this

102
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,010
is actually the joy of developing I love

103
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:22,620
refactoring things I love this feeling

104
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:25,050
of abstraction but I want to take this

105
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:26,570
idea and take it a step

106
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:28,610
there I want to get a little bit maybe

107
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:30,800
more academic or theoretical with it and

108
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,570
so to do that I obviously went to

109
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:34,550
Wikipedia which is definitely the

110
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:37,460
academic source here it says abstraction

111
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:39,980
tries to factor out details from a

112
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:41,930
common pattern so that programmers can

113
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:44,890
work close to the level of human thought

114
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:47,810
pause on that close to the level of

115
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:49,790
human thought we're gonna come back to

116
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:52,580
this but that's pretty questionable all

117
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:54,230
right so we're close to the level of

118
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:56,690
human thought leaving out details which

119
00:04:56,690 --> 00:05:00,050
matter in practice but are immaterial to

120
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:03,380
the problem being solved we're gonna

121
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:06,350
flag that too in material to the problem

122
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:08,840
being solved we've got danger danger all

123
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,020
right keep this in mind as we continue

124
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:14,510
alright so another little anecdote uh I

125
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:17,570
was the lead instructor at a boot camp

126
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:20,360
program in Brooklyn and if you have

127
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,670
questions about boot camps I understand

128
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:25,130
but this one was awesome basically

129
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:26,600
really took people who had never

130
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,880
programmed before but also were

131
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,790
unemployed so you had to meet a certain

132
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:34,610
criteria and then over the six months we

133
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:37,250
taught them to become developers and we

134
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:39,440
also got them jobs and so this was a

135
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,660
really really great program and it's

136
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:42,920
still funded today it's called the New

137
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:45,560
York City web development fellowship but

138
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:47,930
more important I think is that this is

139
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:49,670
really where I began to understand that

140
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:52,130
teaching was one of the fundamental

141
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:56,290
skills that a developer needs and so

142
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:58,610
about a week before I was going to start

143
00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:00,530
I was at a Ruby user group with the Dean

144
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:02,660
of the school and he was talking about

145
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:05,390
how great Ruby is as a development

146
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:07,610
language it was designed to be read as

147
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:09,950
if it was spoken by a human being

148
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:12,260
consequently it is in English and this

149
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:13,910
was by a Japanese person which is

150
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:17,630
extremely complicated but either way

151
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:19,970
what he said was he's like look at this

152
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:22,730
Ruby each loop even your mom could

153
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:27,770
understand that sidebar that's not okay

154
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:30,610
moms are smart and cool do not be rude

155
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:32,150
all right

156
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:34,250
so you're looking at this and you're

157
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:36,470
saying oh Ruby is so great and though

158
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:38,660
you might be getting the sinking

159
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:42,110
mission that I don't agree with him I

160
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,640
will say that at the core he had a

161
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:46,160
really important thing to say all right

162
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,610
JavaScript maybe too much punctuation he

163
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:51,920
is saying programs must be written for

164
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:55,370
people to read and only incidentally for

165
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:58,160
machines to execute and this is a really

166
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,500
important thing to understand all right

167
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,480
the people who are interfacing with your

168
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:06,470
code are primarily people the computers

169
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:08,360
involved are kind of over here the

170
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,160
people maintaining it the people using

171
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,020
it the people writing it all right they

172
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:13,610
are the people interacting and you have

173
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:15,850
to realize that they are not computers

174
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:19,400
but the idea of people being able to

175
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:24,740
read something is tough this is my door

176
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:27,530
in Queens and you can see here I wrote

177
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:30,410
some notes and then you can see down

178
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:33,740
here the UPS person saying nope we miss

179
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:36,200
you and we could not open the door so

180
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,360
again understanding what the level of

181
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:40,070
human thought is what people can read

182
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:42,670
and understand is a tricky thing

183
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:45,830
so another anecdote and as you may have

184
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:48,590
guessed I am NOT going to come out on

185
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:51,500
Ruby's side here so I was sitting at my

186
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,720
computer and my assistant instructor was

187
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,520
sitting in front of the class and he was

188
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,640
teaching iteration all right iteration

189
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:01,220
is hard for beginners and I could hear

190
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:02,810
just through the one side of my

191
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:05,690
headphones it was not going well at all

192
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:07,220
and this has been going on for a while

193
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:09,440
and so if any of you guys know me I

194
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,710
decided to do something bold and that's

195
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:13,820
quite in my nature

196
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:16,400
and so what I did is I interrupted the

197
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:20,570
class and I said hey I'd like you for a

198
00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:24,020
second to ignore all of the Ruby you

199
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:25,610
just learned this probably shouldn't be

200
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:27,260
hard because you're extremely irritated

201
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:28,760
and frustrated with it right now and

202
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:31,340
then what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna

203
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:34,669
teach you iteration using a language you

204
00:08:34,669 --> 00:08:37,550
don't know and they're like that sounds

205
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:40,150
like a bad idea like I know I know but

206
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:42,620
look just let me try this is already

207
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:44,330
kind of terrible let's let's just roll

208
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:47,210
with it and so that's exactly what I did

209
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:49,460
what I'd like to point out here is we

210
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:51,840
understand that the concept of iteration

211
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:56,330
is really three concepts state condition

212
00:08:56,330 --> 00:08:59,660
increment in that Ruby

213
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:02,430
that's all hidden away inside that

214
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:06,120
keyword each but in the JavaScript I can

215
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:09,240
point to it right there because it was

216
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:12,480
exposed by the syntax the developers

217
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,610
that I were teaching were able to see

218
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:16,260
that and it could feel more control over

219
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:18,930
it all right it exposed the underlying

220
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:21,620
concepts that the abstraction hid away

221
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:24,240
and as experienced developers we love

222
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,280
that it's in a way but beginners hate it

223
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:29,220
it's very very confusing it's this idea

224
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:31,710
of magic which sometimes we think is

225
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:33,720
good for beginners but it turns out that

226
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:38,160
it's not all right so my secret

227
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,140
physicist boyfriend Richard 5-minutes

228
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:43,500
has something to say about this a bit he

229
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:46,170
says the real problem in speech is not

230
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:49,290
precise language the problem is clear

231
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:51,660
language it is really quite impossible

232
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:54,020
to say anything with absolute precision

233
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:57,030
unless that thing is so abstracted from

234
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:59,820
the real world as to not represent any

235
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:03,540
real thing and so remember with Ruby we

236
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:05,970
were trying to be real we're trying to

237
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:09,870
be human language all right and so we

238
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:11,910
have these kinds of dichotomies that we

239
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:14,940
run into the desire to be precise but

240
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:17,490
also the desire to be clear and at the

241
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:19,230
same time we also want to be abstract

242
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:20,820
because we don't want to be writing out

243
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:23,220
everything but there's also a desire to

244
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:24,870
map things towards reality so they're

245
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:27,600
easier to reason about all right and so

246
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,340
Pablo Picasso kind of leads us in a

247
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:32,250
direction he says there is no abstract

248
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:36,260
art you must always start with something

249
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:39,920
afterward you can remove all traces of

250
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:44,160
reality so we kind of have an origin

251
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,050
problem here when we're designing

252
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:48,150
programming languages where do we start

253
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:50,820
on the edges of these dichotomies all

254
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:51,240
right

255
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:53,250
this is my favorite slide from every

256
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:55,140
conference talk ever you may have seen

257
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:57,690
it already but what I want to imply is

258
00:10:57,690 --> 00:10:59,040
with programming languages

259
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:02,160
we're often doing this to our developers

260
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,260
all right so if you can't read it it

261
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:05,100
says how did

262
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:09,840
an owl draw some circles draw the rest

263
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:12,510
of the owl that is the only

264
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:14,240
curse word in this talk unless I mess up

265
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:17,130
alright so but we need to understand is

266
00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:18,900
both of these instructions and the

267
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:21,480
instructions themselves are terrible

268
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,830
this is no good

269
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:25,320
alright we're in this kind of lock all

270
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,760
right and this is all this is from

271
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:27,780
Brooklyn not Queens

272
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:29,760
so you can kind of be right all right

273
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:33,480
we're stuck here and so hopefully some

274
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:35,850
of you got the reference the clickbait

275
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:38,190
enos of my title which is i'm going to

276
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:39,960
be walking you through a little bit of

277
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:43,440
some Carl Sagan all right and he says

278
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,390
when we're doing this we need to think

279
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:48,150
about thinking all right and for him he

280
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:52,470
says the journey starts here so let's

281
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:54,600
talk about cousin space right yeah you

282
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:57,180
guys remember that cows in space from

283
00:11:57,180 --> 00:12:00,600
our man Pablo Picasso all right all

284
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:03,270
right so when we think about thinking we

285
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:05,370
need to know humans are amazing at

286
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:08,340
pattern recognition we're able to look

287
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:12,720
at something like this and see this you

288
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:18,150
see it right now well someone saw and

289
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:21,540
convinced everyone because that we have

290
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:26,400
this right a cow in space so we need to

291
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,870
realize when we do this pattern

292
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:30,360
recognition all right we recognize

293
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,280
patterns and when we name them we're

294
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:35,010
building our abstractions now this is a

295
00:12:35,010 --> 00:12:37,890
very dangerous activity because bad

296
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:39,810
abstractions are probably one of the

297
00:12:39,810 --> 00:12:42,660
most dangerous things out there so you

298
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:45,330
might be familiar with horoscopes the

299
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:48,930
entire field of cosmology has come out

300
00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:50,610
of this all right and people spend so

301
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:52,020
much time and money and worrying about

302
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:56,280
it this is my horoscope from today maybe

303
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,780
it's right I don't know maybe I'm wrong

304
00:12:57,780 --> 00:12:59,520
about this being a false abstraction I

305
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:02,370
also had this one which told me that I

306
00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:03,990
have nothing to worry about you guys are

307
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:07,320
charming so we'll see how that works out

308
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:11,280
all right so what I'm trying to say here

309
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:13,530
is that when you're recognizing patterns

310
00:13:13,530 --> 00:13:16,470
building abstractions paving the cow

311
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:17,130
paths

312
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:18,899
yes I'm sticking with this meadow

313
00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:24,209
or we need to be very careful all right

314
00:13:24,209 --> 00:13:25,949
because again bad abstractions are

315
00:13:25,949 --> 00:13:28,559
extremely dangerous so now let's talk

316
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:29,839
about JavaScript

317
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:32,430
alright javascript has been a delightful

318
00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:34,709
beginning programming language because

319
00:13:34,709 --> 00:13:37,019
it has left a lot of abstractions and

320
00:13:37,019 --> 00:13:42,660
that's all about to change so September

321
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:45,629
28th 1980 is when JavaScript was

322
00:13:45,629 --> 00:13:49,110
invented come on guys really that's not

323
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:51,809
true all right no that's when they show

324
00:13:51,809 --> 00:13:53,610
cosmos came out and again this was by

325
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:56,009
Carl Sagan and the key to this show was

326
00:13:56,009 --> 00:13:58,829
to make available the underlying

327
00:13:58,829 --> 00:14:00,899
scientific concepts that ruled our

328
00:14:00,899 --> 00:14:02,819
universe make that available to the

329
00:14:02,819 --> 00:14:04,529
layperson and this was extremely

330
00:14:04,529 --> 00:14:07,170
important all right and in doing so he

331
00:14:07,170 --> 00:14:08,579
kind of had this catchphrase where he

332
00:14:08,579 --> 00:14:10,769
said if you wish to make an apple pie

333
00:14:10,769 --> 00:14:13,529
from scratch you must first invent the

334
00:14:13,529 --> 00:14:15,899
universe and it has to say that to

335
00:14:15,899 --> 00:14:17,910
really understand what's going on in our

336
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:20,040
world understanding the fundamental

337
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:22,529
concept is extremely important I heard

338
00:14:22,529 --> 00:14:26,069
this and I was like yes this is the

339
00:14:26,069 --> 00:14:27,540
issue we have at es6

340
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:29,519
oh yeah by the way I'm not gonna say

341
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:31,769
that he has 6 2015 thing if you get

342
00:14:31,769 --> 00:14:35,639
upset about that I don't care all right

343
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:36,990
so this was a girl say again this is

344
00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:38,519
actually me but I'd like to think that

345
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:41,429
he supports this cause all right so

346
00:14:41,429 --> 00:14:46,589
let's talk about es6 alright so as Gina

347
00:14:46,589 --> 00:14:48,870
mentioned we're gonna read some of the

348
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:52,079
spec now yay all right so Ekman script

349
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:54,899
syntax is relaxed to enable it to serve

350
00:14:54,899 --> 00:14:58,470
as an easy to use scripting language now

351
00:14:58,470 --> 00:15:00,449
relaxing is cool I love being in Germany

352
00:15:00,449 --> 00:15:02,249
I like relaxing around here have some

353
00:15:02,249 --> 00:15:04,920
beers but it's not always the right

354
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:08,519
message that's a real thing that was a

355
00:15:08,519 --> 00:15:10,829
first message on the OkCupid dating app

356
00:15:10,829 --> 00:15:15,600
all right is is relaxation really the

357
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,069
problem that JavaScript is trying to

358
00:15:17,069 --> 00:15:20,519
solve is were there not enough relaxing

359
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:22,410
languages out there and so we have

360
00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:27,120
JavaScript now probably not right so

361
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,309
what problem is JavaScript trying to

362
00:15:29,309 --> 00:15:32,610
solve like well Java scripts legacy be

363
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:34,079
and we look back at it as this like

364
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:36,149
strange artifact from computer science

365
00:15:36,149 --> 00:15:39,390
and that's a really heavy question and I

366
00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:41,790
don't really know the answer but I think

367
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:43,320
it's gonna have something to do with

368
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:46,740
this alright and this is Laurie Voss CTO

369
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:50,610
of NPM and he says fundamentally it's

370
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:52,709
hard to think of a compelling reason a

371
00:15:52,709 --> 00:15:55,290
brand new web dev would learn two

372
00:15:55,290 --> 00:15:57,450
languages when they can just learn

373
00:15:57,450 --> 00:15:59,730
JavaScript now that might sound pretty

374
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:02,550
controversial they follow up by saying

375
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:04,589
if I could pick any language in the

376
00:16:04,589 --> 00:16:06,390
world to use them both the server and

377
00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:09,140
the client it might not be JavaScript

378
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:13,380
but we don't get to pick so let's think

379
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:16,649
about that and then we'll talk about

380
00:16:16,649 --> 00:16:21,329
equity script six classes you can tell

381
00:16:21,329 --> 00:16:25,350
what I'm gonna say right robot there all

382
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:29,010
right so sugar makes me sick but like

383
00:16:29,010 --> 00:16:31,050
literally it makes me sick I have type 1

384
00:16:31,050 --> 00:16:35,519
diabetes but also syntactic sugar makes

385
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:38,459
me nervous and spectacular sugar makes

386
00:16:38,459 --> 00:16:39,959
me nervous because again we see that

387
00:16:39,959 --> 00:16:41,820
syntax always obfuscates these

388
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:45,920
underlying concepts so back to the spec

389
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,930
even though Ekman script includes syntax

390
00:16:48,930 --> 00:16:51,300
for class definitions Ekman script

391
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:53,850
objects are not fundamentally

392
00:16:53,850 --> 00:16:58,860
class-based alright so you might not

393
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:03,269
need class syntax alright so this is a

394
00:17:03,269 --> 00:17:05,669
man who if any if you take anything out

395
00:17:05,669 --> 00:17:09,120
of this talk take this away he says

396
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:13,319
remember that all models are wrong the

397
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:16,589
practical question is how wrong do they

398
00:17:16,589 --> 00:17:21,299
have to be to not be useful what that's

399
00:17:21,299 --> 00:17:25,589
it in all right so how wrong are we all

400
00:17:25,589 --> 00:17:27,270
right so in a class-based

401
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:29,900
object-oriented language in general

402
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:33,030
state is carried by instances methods

403
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:34,860
are carried by classes and inheritance

404
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:37,429
is only if structure and behavior in

405
00:17:37,429 --> 00:17:40,260
ACMA script the state and methods are

406
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:42,360
carried by objects well structure

407
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:46,880
behavior and state are all inherited

408
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,929
all right so that might be a little bit

409
00:17:48,929 --> 00:17:50,309
difficult to parse if you've never read

410
00:17:50,309 --> 00:17:51,899
this before I really dealt with them

411
00:17:51,899 --> 00:17:54,539
so I'm gonna use a blog post by this guy

412
00:17:54,539 --> 00:17:56,159
named Regan Walt who I'm gonna shout out

413
00:17:56,159 --> 00:17:57,929
for being awesome for saying stuff like

414
00:17:57,929 --> 00:17:58,500
this

415
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,659
he wrote a blog post called prototypes

416
00:18:00,659 --> 00:18:03,090
or not classes where basically and I

417
00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:05,009
won't read this to you he explains the

418
00:18:05,009 --> 00:18:07,440
idea that classes are described as often

419
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,360
as boiler plates all right their

420
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,730
blueprints the class is the blueprint

421
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:13,950
and then we make a house from it all

422
00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:16,799
right and the house is the object but

423
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:19,740
that's not true with es6 JavaScript

424
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:23,129
classes are model homes the idea here is

425
00:18:23,129 --> 00:18:24,899
that you have a model home and you can

426
00:18:24,899 --> 00:18:27,570
build a house based on it and you could

427
00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:30,419
leave the model home empty but someone

428
00:18:30,419 --> 00:18:33,870
could move in I mean that since things

429
00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:37,259
get a little tricky all right so what we

430
00:18:37,259 --> 00:18:39,419
understand here is that we have a syntax

431
00:18:39,419 --> 00:18:42,360
that cloak lis really Optus gates the

432
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:45,149
underlying functionality all right and

433
00:18:45,149 --> 00:18:47,639
so you might be thinking that I'm saying

434
00:18:47,639 --> 00:18:50,429
you know you know Java Cooper classes

435
00:18:50,429 --> 00:18:52,710
are their objects there they're not

436
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:56,370
classes really and maybe go home tc39

437
00:18:56,370 --> 00:18:57,529
you're drunk

438
00:18:57,529 --> 00:19:01,350
this is me and that is ginger ale all

439
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:04,409
right but no that's not what I'm saying

440
00:19:04,409 --> 00:19:07,139
at all I'm saying this is not a hate

441
00:19:07,139 --> 00:19:10,259
talk in any way shape or form instead

442
00:19:10,259 --> 00:19:11,759
what I'm hoping to suggest here is that

443
00:19:11,759 --> 00:19:13,950
we take a different perspective when

444
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:15,450
we're evaluating new features for

445
00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:17,190
language and that that perspective is

446
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:19,440
the educational one and so I do want to

447
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:22,440
mention just briefly all right that you

448
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,789
could easily shut me down by being with

449
00:19:23,789 --> 00:19:25,230
what even is a class is that even

450
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:27,149
defined and I'd be like meet me

451
00:19:27,149 --> 00:19:28,769
afterwards and we can talk about this

452
00:19:28,769 --> 00:19:31,289
this language which introduced them it

453
00:19:31,289 --> 00:19:34,259
is super super awesome all right so you

454
00:19:34,259 --> 00:19:35,730
might be thinking that I'm trying to why

455
00:19:35,730 --> 00:19:38,279
wage class warfare because I told you I

456
00:19:38,279 --> 00:19:40,769
was an anarchist right this is near my

457
00:19:40,769 --> 00:19:43,590
apartment here that's a real thing I

458
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:45,480
don't even want to deal with that all

459
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:47,940
right but instead what I'm trying to say

460
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:50,940
is that JavaScript might be trying to do

461
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:54,229
a lot of things and not be any of them

462
00:19:54,229 --> 00:19:58,019
if you ever go to Penn Station this is

463
00:19:58,019 --> 00:20:00,690
by Madison Square Garden it wasn't open

464
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:02,700
when I took the picture but I intend to

465
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:07,889
return yeah so uh listen the glam Boy

466
00:20:07,889 --> 00:20:10,049
has this amazing talk called syncing for

467
00:20:10,049 --> 00:20:12,539
programmers and in this talk he says

468
00:20:12,539 --> 00:20:15,299
writing is nature's way of letting you

469
00:20:15,299 --> 00:20:18,389
know how sloppy your thinking is and so

470
00:20:18,389 --> 00:20:22,080
I like to take that and I say teaching

471
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,929
is nature's way of letting you know how

472
00:20:24,929 --> 00:20:28,289
sloppy your understanding is how many

473
00:20:28,289 --> 00:20:29,609
people in here have ever taught

474
00:20:29,609 --> 00:20:33,269
programming everyone who has their hand

475
00:20:33,269 --> 00:20:38,190
down do it it is by far the own like one

476
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:39,570
of the best ways to improve your

477
00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:44,849
programming skills all right so those

478
00:20:44,849 --> 00:20:46,529
fancy people who are talking about

479
00:20:46,529 --> 00:20:48,149
programming needing to be able to be

480
00:20:48,149 --> 00:20:49,859
read by humans they wrote this amazing

481
00:20:49,859 --> 00:20:52,859
book all right and this is a huge change

482
00:20:52,859 --> 00:20:55,259
in computer science education what they

483
00:20:55,259 --> 00:20:56,399
said is we need to be teaching

484
00:20:56,399 --> 00:20:58,830
programming concepts not language

485
00:20:58,830 --> 00:21:01,679
features when we're programming we need

486
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:03,629
to understand the activities the

487
00:21:03,629 --> 00:21:05,399
abstractions that we're building not

488
00:21:05,399 --> 00:21:08,489
where to put a semicolon all right

489
00:21:08,489 --> 00:21:10,649
and this is super important when we

490
00:21:10,649 --> 00:21:12,509
think about the idea that we have

491
00:21:12,509 --> 00:21:14,729
programming concepts that conflict with

492
00:21:14,729 --> 00:21:17,580
our syntax in JavaScript JavaScript will

493
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:18,989
be the introduction to programming

494
00:21:18,989 --> 00:21:21,570
concepts for an entire generation of

495
00:21:21,570 --> 00:21:24,629
developers whether we like it or not and

496
00:21:24,629 --> 00:21:27,330
so we need to be cognizant of this idea

497
00:21:27,330 --> 00:21:29,489
and 2.2 miles this talk we need to be

498
00:21:29,489 --> 00:21:32,999
empathetic of our users our JavaScript

499
00:21:32,999 --> 00:21:34,379
users which is going to be people

500
00:21:34,379 --> 00:21:37,349
learning programming all right we need

501
00:21:37,349 --> 00:21:39,330
to be thinking about the problem that's

502
00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:41,849
being solved and oftentimes the problem

503
00:21:41,849 --> 00:21:43,830
that JavaScript is solving is teaching

504
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:46,950
people how to program so to follow up

505
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:49,349
that book sicp written by Abelson and

506
00:21:49,349 --> 00:21:50,909
Sussman was this excellent person named

507
00:21:50,909 --> 00:21:53,249
peter van roy and so what I'm not trying

508
00:21:53,249 --> 00:21:54,899
to say is that these new features are

509
00:21:54,899 --> 00:21:56,669
making JavaScript a terrible programming

510
00:21:56,669 --> 00:21:58,859
language but something a little bit

511
00:21:58,859 --> 00:22:01,349
different so he came up with this book

512
00:22:01,349 --> 00:22:02,940
that followed it up and he said we need

513
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:05,339
to teach programming as a unified

514
00:22:05,339 --> 00:22:06,970
discipline

515
00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:08,770
the way he did that in his class all

516
00:22:08,770 --> 00:22:10,299
right was to talk about programming

517
00:22:10,299 --> 00:22:12,850
languages as tools programming languages

518
00:22:12,850 --> 00:22:15,190
solve problems the solutions that they

519
00:22:15,190 --> 00:22:17,590
provide combined with those problems all

520
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:20,140
right to be paradigms and so perverting

521
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:22,210
the images are able to do well at one

522
00:22:22,210 --> 00:22:24,250
programming paradigm sometimes they do

523
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:25,809
better at others but there's not

524
00:22:25,809 --> 00:22:28,380
necessarily any bad programming language

525
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:30,730
all right and so when he taught his

526
00:22:30,730 --> 00:22:32,110
classes he would insist that people

527
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:34,960
start from the beginning to invent the

528
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,940
universe you might say and what he did

529
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:38,950
is he had them build an entire kernel

530
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:41,049
and he says a good way to organize a

531
00:22:41,049 --> 00:22:42,789
programming course is to start with a

532
00:22:42,789 --> 00:22:45,100
simple language and then to extend this

533
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:48,070
language gradually so I'm obviously

534
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:50,320
saying all right we must invent the

535
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,299
universe when we teach programming we

536
00:22:52,299 --> 00:22:53,530
need to make sure that we teach the

537
00:22:53,530 --> 00:22:55,600
underlying concepts before we teach the

538
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,780
abstractions you need to feel the pain

539
00:22:57,780 --> 00:23:00,159
before you know how do you use that tool

540
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:02,740
all right so obviously every beginner

541
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:05,409
sure at a current language right this is

542
00:23:05,409 --> 00:23:07,120
a really terrible idea no one should

543
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:10,240
ever do that unless yeah just no all

544
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,980
right but what we can take from this is

545
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:14,440
this idea of creative extension all

546
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:15,610
right and we actually are kind of

547
00:23:15,610 --> 00:23:18,309
familiar with this all right Ron

548
00:23:18,309 --> 00:23:19,870
Jeffries who did extreme programming

549
00:23:19,870 --> 00:23:22,179
every know if that's a thing anymore but

550
00:23:22,179 --> 00:23:23,980
this is something that we know always

551
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:26,049
implement things when you actually need

552
00:23:26,049 --> 00:23:28,600
them never when you just foresee that

553
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,820
you need them don't pre optimize all

554
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:33,520
right so what we need to know is that

555
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,620
prototypal inheritance is a big part of

556
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:37,630
the JavaScript universe we might think

557
00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:39,490
classes are useful but they're not good

558
00:23:39,490 --> 00:23:41,169
for teaching and we should not start

559
00:23:41,169 --> 00:23:43,179
with them all right this is how the

560
00:23:43,179 --> 00:23:45,429
apple pie gets made vegan-friendly

561
00:23:45,429 --> 00:23:50,080
metaphors all right so this is a tldr

562
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:53,230
slide so if you go back as a teacher I

563
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:54,789
always kind of like giving an index for

564
00:23:54,789 --> 00:23:56,470
my points all right but what I'm trying

565
00:23:56,470 --> 00:23:58,000
to say is that when we look at

566
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,100
programming languages we need to be

567
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:02,830
empathetic to our audience and we also

568
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:07,120
need to understand that abstraction is a

569
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,580
difficult thing for beginners all right

570
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:11,289
and that no matter what we do with our

571
00:24:11,289 --> 00:24:13,690
language when we teach we need to start

572
00:24:13,690 --> 00:24:16,000
at the beginning and now I'm going to

573
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,649
take the last five minutes I have to

574
00:24:17,649 --> 00:24:20,420
kind of put you guys on call

575
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:22,220
because I have this kind of kumbaya

576
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:26,000
question right what do we even mean when

577
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:31,940
we talk about programming right so this

578
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:33,170
is one of my favorite philosophers

579
00:24:33,170 --> 00:24:35,360
Martin Heidegger and you wrote this book

580
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:36,920
called what is called thinking which is

581
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:39,590
a very bad translation of a German that

582
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:41,030
I'm not entirely sure how to pronounce

583
00:24:41,030 --> 00:24:44,990
either but in it he says this the most

584
00:24:44,990 --> 00:24:47,480
thought-provoking thing in our

585
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:50,330
thought-provoking time is that we are

586
00:24:50,330 --> 00:24:53,990
still not thinking and you might see

587
00:24:53,990 --> 00:24:56,540
where I'm going with this because I'm

588
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:59,810
gonna ask are we programming yet when we

589
00:24:59,810 --> 00:25:02,060
look at the JavaScript language remember

590
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:04,700
the Dijkstra said abstraction is at the

591
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:06,830
core do you feel like that's what you

592
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:09,410
spend most of your time doing or is it

593
00:25:09,410 --> 00:25:13,280
just lint is it I miss the semicolon all

594
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:13,610
right

595
00:25:13,610 --> 00:25:16,130
a lot of people like to think that

596
00:25:16,130 --> 00:25:18,920
things that are difficult like C++

597
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:22,040
alright is made to be difficult to make

598
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:23,510
sure that you're a good programmer and

599
00:25:23,510 --> 00:25:25,490
doing it right but I don't think that's

600
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:28,190
a good idea at all all right there are

601
00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:30,140
people in the Academy who are taking

602
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:32,690
this idea seriously and really trying to

603
00:25:32,690 --> 00:25:34,730
think about what programming should be

604
00:25:34,730 --> 00:25:37,100
and as they design languages designing

605
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:39,350
for that all right and it's frustrating

606
00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:41,450
to me because this seems to only be

607
00:25:41,450 --> 00:25:43,790
happening in the Academy like MIT with

608
00:25:43,790 --> 00:25:46,310
scratch why are we not looking at that

609
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:49,070
in the industry and I think it's

610
00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:51,680
something that we should be doing so

611
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:53,600
Thomas Kuhn is a philosopher and a

612
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,820
scientist and you wrote in this great

613
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:57,710
book the structure of scientific

614
00:25:57,710 --> 00:26:00,410
revolutions that scientists worked for

615
00:26:00,410 --> 00:26:02,630
models acquired through education and

616
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:04,220
through subsequent exposure to

617
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:06,970
literature often without quite knowing

618
00:26:06,970 --> 00:26:10,280
or needing to know what characteristics

619
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:12,890
have given these models the status of

620
00:26:12,890 --> 00:26:16,070
community paradigms why do we want

621
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:18,590
classes are we sure that's the right

622
00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:21,950
thing or did just Ruby do it and a bunch

623
00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:23,330
of other people did it and now we've

624
00:26:23,330 --> 00:26:26,690
decided that we need to catch up is that

625
00:26:26,690 --> 00:26:28,010
the perspective we really should be

626
00:26:28,010 --> 00:26:31,720
taking so we have an awesome opportunity

627
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:34,100
to more radically think

628
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:39,110
about how we extend JavaScript all right

629
00:26:39,110 --> 00:26:41,570
we can think more radically about how we

630
00:26:41,570 --> 00:26:43,460
build the abstractions and which ones we

631
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:46,640
want to build all right I'll leave you

632
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:49,370
with this Carl Sagan says it is far

633
00:26:49,370 --> 00:26:52,580
better to grasp the universe as it

634
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:55,669
really is than to persist in delusion

635
00:26:55,669 --> 00:26:59,360
however satisfying and reassuring so I

636
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:05,179
ask you reconsider your ontology think

637
00:27:05,179 --> 00:27:07,130
about it a lot is this the language of

638
00:27:07,130 --> 00:27:09,190
these the abstractions that we need and

639
00:27:09,190 --> 00:27:21,779
always stay a beginner thank you

640
00:27:21,789 --> 00:27:30,080
all right

641
00:27:30,090 --> 00:27:34,600
all right I have a final thing and I

642
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:36,280
always like to take this back to my

643
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:37,930
students because as I said this is where

644
00:27:37,930 --> 00:27:40,270
I've learned everything they have built

645
00:27:40,270 --> 00:27:45,100
a kind of silly website called clap for

646
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:48,580
Ashley and if you tweet at this hashtag

647
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:51,280
it will pop up and clap but I asked and

648
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:52,900
as I mentioned the Mozilla swag before

649
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:55,600
if you could tweet something about how

650
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:56,950
you're going to stay a beginner or

651
00:27:56,950 --> 00:27:58,630
commit yourself to teaching other

652
00:27:58,630 --> 00:28:00,880
beginners we've got some really cool

653
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:03,310
Mozilla bags that I will hand out to

654
00:28:03,310 --> 00:28:05,860
people who tweet great stuff so again

655
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:08,650
thank you and I'll leave this here if

656
00:28:08,650 --> 00:28:11,110
anybody wants to dive in assuming that

657
00:28:11,110 --> 00:28:15,400
the internet works this is always

658
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,840
awkward cuz it's like no one's clapping

659
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:22,370
for me I understand it might be broken
