1
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:14,370

reject yeah good morning my name is rana

2
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:17,940
jaramillo and I'm developer and Omega

3
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:20,310
and I will spend the next 30 minutes

4
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:22,800
trying to convince you that you should

5
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,720
get your hands dirty and start playing

6
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:29,670
with hardware I believe that disruptive

7
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:33,000
technologies change society and we can

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,360
drive the change in different directions

9
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,129
for instance the web can be a really

10
00:00:38,129 --> 00:00:41,309
nice place in a great place but it's not

11
00:00:41,309 --> 00:00:44,700
only the technology behind it but it's

12
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:46,530
the culture that would manage to build

13
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:49,469
around it especially if it's is a

14
00:00:49,469 --> 00:00:51,680
culture the value openness transparency

15
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:56,090
collaboration diversity and creativity

16
00:00:56,090 --> 00:01:00,719
mmm and we are now moving into the

17
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:02,910
future where applications will be

18
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:05,369
connected and driven by sensors rather

19
00:01:05,369 --> 00:01:09,930
than by user input and computing will be

20
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:12,869
everywhere and on everything and we need

21
00:01:12,869 --> 00:01:14,250
to start thinking about what kind of

22
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:19,409
values we want in this new space and why

23
00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:22,380
I'm talking to you well this is a Venn

24
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:27,330
diagram by brand initial and as you can

25
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:29,670
see there is a large set of people who

26
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:31,470
knows you have a script it small set of

27
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:35,400
people who know C C++ and a large set of

28
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:39,780
people with awesome ideas and we need

29
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:43,770
more awesome you know about software and

30
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:46,350
you know about networks but we all need

31
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:48,540
to learn more about hardware not

32
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:50,640
necessarily because you will be building

33
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,700
products but we need to know enough in

34
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,439
order to dream about the possibilities

35
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:58,590
and think about what kind of future we

36
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:03,030
want my talk would go like this first a

37
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:05,670
bit about my background then why I think

38
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:07,170
now is the right time to start tinkering

39
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:10,349
a question about hardwood and you have a

40
00:02:10,349 --> 00:02:11,480
script

41
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:14,750
where you should start and at the end

42
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:16,800
fallax here we'll do a bit of walking

43
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:23,069
and i'll do some show-and-tell i was

44
00:02:23,069 --> 00:02:26,190
born in 73 the same here these three

45
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:28,160
characters first were introduced

46
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,420
probably a lot of you don't know who

47
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:35,760
they are or what they are but during my

48
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,790
childhood they fuel my life on

49
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:40,890
fascination for technology and robots

50
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:44,640
and still to this day they shake my tree

51
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,130
may interest in exoskeletons and

52
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:50,850
prosthetics and androids in all that

53
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:54,570
sort of stuff my early teens my biggest

54
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:58,260
wish was a hero one robot kit and it

55
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:00,560
probably cost it an arm and a leg

56
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,060
because my parents got me a dremel

57
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:07,530
instead and they told me that I could be

58
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:12,870
my build my own and this started a life

59
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:15,690
of tinkering and working with mechanical

60
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:21,920
contractions and much the same way I

61
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:26,100
wanted a Terry game console and my

62
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:27,959
parents they bought me an atari st

63
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:31,920
computer and that got me into coding and

64
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,290
we'll really got me hook was the first

65
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:36,329
time i was able to control pixels on the

66
00:03:36,329 --> 00:03:40,739
screen and even though i was into tech

67
00:03:40,739 --> 00:03:44,370
and software I didn't went to

68
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:48,980
engineering school writing passes and

69
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:51,810
optimizing sorting algorithm wasn't my

70
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:55,440
idea of fun so I went to art school and

71
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:58,980
did architecture and industrial and

72
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:02,130
graphic design but still in high school

73
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:05,370
I keep coding and doing small projects

74
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:08,670
and got a part-time job with multimedia

75
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:13,530
development and in this agency the web

76
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:20,150
exploded and suddenly I became a 1 pixel

77
00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:23,180
gift table ninja

78
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:27,009
and we were churning out small web apps

79
00:04:27,009 --> 00:04:31,990
even though this agency had serious

80
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:35,240
software developers but they were busy

81
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,850
doing custom desktop applications for

82
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:40,610
enterprise they didn't want to have

83
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:44,199
anything with the web five years laters

84
00:04:44,199 --> 00:04:48,530
all this sort of custom development was

85
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:51,770
done on top of a lamp stack as web

86
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:53,750
applications and the developers that

87
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:58,680
didn't embrace the web they were gone a

88
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:01,910
show of hands out of curiosity how many

89
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:04,039
of you has another background but

90
00:05:04,039 --> 00:05:15,919
software engineering okay nice the in 94

91
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:20,690
Paul Milgram described in a paper this

92
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:22,639
space we now call the Milgram continuum

93
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:28,330
at this is a place were this is a mix of

94
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:31,190
the virtual environment and one side and

95
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:33,320
the real environment on the other side

96
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:35,479
and technology is quickly filling this

97
00:05:35,479 --> 00:05:38,300
space up and the thing is that each

98
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:40,699
major technology converging in this

99
00:05:40,699 --> 00:05:43,729
space right now hardware software and

100
00:05:43,729 --> 00:05:46,729
connectivity has previously had a huge

101
00:05:46,729 --> 00:05:50,300
impact on its own so there is no limit

102
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:51,620
to the amount of how you're currently

103
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:54,620
seeing based on the spected implications

104
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:57,740
of this development for some of this

105
00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:00,500
technology media and industry has coined

106
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:03,110
this label IOT or Internet of Things and

107
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:05,210
probably you already can't find the term

108
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:09,919
in a bingo card and why I think

109
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:11,599
that you can get a foothold in this

110
00:06:11,599 --> 00:06:15,889
space well there is a trend where

111
00:06:15,889 --> 00:06:18,229
hardware is undergoing a democratization

112
00:06:18,229 --> 00:06:22,960
process and this process is driven by

113
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:26,659
different forces but I will highlight

114
00:06:26,659 --> 00:06:29,960
three open hardware component ization

115
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:33,419
and rapid prototyping

116
00:06:33,419 --> 00:06:36,580
let me ask again how many of you have

117
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:40,210
heard about Audrina's epidermal chippers

118
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:43,030
good well adrenals are the best thing

119
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:45,100
coming out of Italy since life's pizza

120
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:50,290
it was born as a platform for

121
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:55,270
prototyping Amy primarily at designers

122
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:57,190
with no background background in

123
00:06:57,190 --> 00:07:01,120
electronics or programming and their

124
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:04,570
decision to release the blue brains with

125
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:06,669
a Creative Commons license change the

126
00:07:06,669 --> 00:07:09,850
industry that on to that point was sort

127
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:14,169
of clothes and very proprietary today

128
00:07:14,169 --> 00:07:15,490
there are thousands of platforms

129
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:18,430
available for physical computing that

130
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:20,639
takes the messy details of

131
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:22,900
microcontroller programming and wrap it

132
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:26,260
up in a easy-to-use package one project

133
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:28,300
and very excited about is the tehsil two

134
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:32,800
coming in november and they they managed

135
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:37,960
to pack and node.js in the on the board

136
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:40,030
and they have to sniff the architecture

137
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:43,000
of clock and play where each component

138
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:49,870
has a corresponding npn package so let

139
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:51,099
me ask how many of you have actually

140
00:07:51,099 --> 00:07:55,810
played with an arduino oh that's nice so

141
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:57,190
I'm preaching for the claw I can see

142
00:07:57,190 --> 00:08:02,020
well the first time I I got to turn an

143
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:04,900
LED on and off with an Arduino it with a

144
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:06,700
very special feeling it was sort of the

145
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:08,860
same feeling I that that got me into

146
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:12,580
programming for the first time and the

147
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:14,919
things that code for ascending from bias

148
00:08:14,919 --> 00:08:16,870
to the physical realm is a very powerful

149
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:22,840
experience and the next aspect i will

150
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,880
talk about its component ization which

151
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,740
i'm not really sure it's a proper would

152
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:32,080
but picture what the NPM is doing for

153
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:36,240
the know Jason ecosystem but then thing

154
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,969
translated to hardware if your project

155
00:08:39,969 --> 00:08:44,290
need a GPS positioning or take pictures

156
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:47,110
or biometrics on

157
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:51,910
or any kind of sensing or communication

158
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:55,240
like Bluetooth or Wi-Fi well there is

159
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:58,269
probably a component for that and these

160
00:08:58,269 --> 00:09:03,279
components they take care of things you

161
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:04,990
don't need to think about internals or

162
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:07,420
the circuitry you just add it to your

163
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:10,839
project pluck it and import libraries

164
00:09:10,839 --> 00:09:13,029
and you're good to go and their

165
00:09:13,029 --> 00:09:15,459
companies companies like Adafruit and

166
00:09:15,459 --> 00:09:17,620
sparkfun and pollute I have you covered

167
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:20,579
they have a lot of amazing stuff and

168
00:09:20,579 --> 00:09:24,850
also tutorials it used to be like it

169
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:28,230
when you need a component you have to

170
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:32,560
read a spec sheet and out of that find

171
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,570
out how things work but today you really

172
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:37,300
have a lot of help adafruit they

173
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:39,220
themselves say jokingly that they are

174
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:41,680
not a hardware company they are a

175
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:47,500
tutorial company with a gift shop the

176
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,899
third aspect I will talk about is rapid

177
00:09:49,899 --> 00:09:54,089
prototyping 3d printers and laser

178
00:09:54,089 --> 00:09:57,310
cutters and CNC machines they are

179
00:09:57,310 --> 00:10:00,490
becoming much more accessible today you

180
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:03,190
can get desktop models of all these

181
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:05,529
machines and they're within the reach of

182
00:10:05,529 --> 00:10:09,579
individuals and the number of fab labs

183
00:10:09,579 --> 00:10:12,850
and maker spaces around the world keep

184
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:16,839
greeting at the same time the software

185
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:21,220
to manage this machine is becoming it's

186
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:24,459
constantly improving and cat system used

187
00:10:24,459 --> 00:10:26,829
to be really expensive and now they're

188
00:10:26,829 --> 00:10:29,620
becoming a commodity the latest

189
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:31,750
generation of this software is

190
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:37,089
cloud-based and collaboration and

191
00:10:37,089 --> 00:10:38,740
versioning is at the core of these

192
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:43,420
packages so how is this relevant yep I

193
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:46,000
could persone personally I can tell you

194
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,149
that the first iteration of fellig's

195
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:51,820
looked like that it was a one-off made

196
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:56,829
in my shop and made of aluminium it you

197
00:10:56,829 --> 00:10:59,380
need tooling and precision and it's easy

198
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:01,030
it's difficult to update

199
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:04,510
and it's difficult to share simplifying

200
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:06,430
the default the design and going

201
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:12,900
digitally I can create much much cleaner

202
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:16,450
hardware which is easy to reproduce easy

203
00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:19,660
to update and easy to share so what's

204
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:21,400
powerful about these machines and

205
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:24,010
software and software systems is that

206
00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:26,200
they allow you to share physical designs

207
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:31,930
the same way that we share code so

208
00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:34,390
what's about with JavaScript and

209
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:38,800
hardware the embedded system used to be

210
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:43,620
programmed with low-level languages and

211
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:47,950
they still do mostly but thanks to some

212
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:52,630
badass developers we have alternative in

213
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:59,680
JavaScript and Johnny 5 is a JavaScript

214
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,960
programming framework that allows you to

215
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:05,910
control a rich variety of hardware and

216
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:08,740
but to be honest the first time I heard

217
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:11,620
about your script and hardware I was

218
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:20,200
like hmm but I after playing with it I

219
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,760
actually found out that this is not a

220
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:24,820
case of what as we can from do in

221
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:28,210
javascript you don't need to clutter

222
00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:31,990
your code with pooling you can add an

223
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:34,150
event least attack an event listener and

224
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:37,600
wait for the call this is because and

225
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,150
and the thing that hard work being a

226
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:43,780
band base and a synchronous by nature

227
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:47,740
make it a really good March then we have

228
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:52,600
the prototypes which provide a required

229
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:56,020
flexibility to create some very neat

230
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:58,780
abstraction layers to hide some of the

231
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:00,400
underlying complexity of all this

232
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:03,040
hardware and Johnny 5 takes great

233
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,620
advantage of all these I can illustrate

234
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:08,170
with an example there are a number of

235
00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:11,200
components you can use to measure

236
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,300
distance and

237
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:17,080
all of these components they have their

238
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:19,839
own way of speaking with the

239
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:22,899
microprocessor they can be sound base

240
00:13:22,899 --> 00:13:30,930
light base or lasers and JavaScript

241
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:35,079
johnny-five wrap it up in a proximity

242
00:13:35,079 --> 00:13:37,630
class and it can looks like and it looks

243
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:42,180
like this in phallic see I have a sharp

244
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:46,980
sensor this is a infrared sensor and the

245
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:49,870
code to manage it is quite simple you

246
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:53,800
get Johnny Five and you instantiate a

247
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:56,200
board when the board is ready you

248
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:59,440
instantiate your component and you tell

249
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,380
the component if the distance to you

250
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:07,000
make sure change please tell me and say

251
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,690
I got the present for christmas i got a

252
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:14,800
light a light laser component the only

253
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,329
thing i have to change is the name of

254
00:14:16,329 --> 00:14:18,790
the controller that's that's quite

255
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:25,500
powerful and so in the same way that

256
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:29,140
jquery sort of abstract the document

257
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:32,230
object model Johnny Five is taking care

258
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:38,300
of all this underlying hardware for you

259
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:41,890
yeah well well you well you can't get

260
00:14:41,890 --> 00:14:46,660
started you can get some toys I will

261
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:49,420
recommend that you get a star kid there

262
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:52,899
are a lot of start kids that came come

263
00:14:52,899 --> 00:14:55,660
with an assortment of sensors and

264
00:14:55,660 --> 00:15:01,779
actuators and then you get 25 and start

265
00:15:01,779 --> 00:15:05,140
playing with the examples besides the

266
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:09,850
community Johnny Five has really good

267
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:11,890
thing going for it is the documentation

268
00:15:11,890 --> 00:15:14,949
and for each example you get this nice

269
00:15:14,949 --> 00:15:16,959
diagram showing how you you can wire

270
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:21,370
everything up and then get this book is

271
00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:26,380
a it's not only about robotics a

272
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:29,110
there are some neat projects wearable

273
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:32,860
projects and also IOT project they would

274
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:37,270
sort of learn you gives you some best

275
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:39,550
practices and ideas of what you can do

276
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:44,380
what's possible in this space but don't

277
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:46,600
lock you need to lock yourself in a room

278
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:51,460
and hide away and start tinkering you

279
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:53,890
can join the community you can join a

280
00:15:53,890 --> 00:15:57,400
node BOTS event there are events and

281
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:00,460
meters around the world if there is no

282
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,590
meet up close to where you live you can

283
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:06,460
consider starting your own chapter you

284
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:09,910
can join a fab lab or make a space how

285
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:13,270
many here are members of makerspace or

286
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:18,040
fab lab that's not much well really

287
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:20,770
consider it you will meet people doing

288
00:16:20,770 --> 00:16:22,120
stuff with the hands it's really

289
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:25,120
inspiring and probably you be the only

290
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,220
one around who really understand

291
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:29,200
programming and you will be treated like

292
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:39,420
a wizard so I'm into robotics I like

293
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:46,330
four legged robots the current state of

294
00:16:46,330 --> 00:16:48,970
the art is represented by person

295
00:16:48,970 --> 00:16:52,650
dynamics they have spot which is a

296
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:56,740
electric four-legged robot and big dark

297
00:16:56,740 --> 00:17:01,470
which you probably have seen that a

298
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:06,970
hydraulic engine power gas power beast

299
00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:10,089
they can run they can jump that's a

300
00:17:10,089 --> 00:17:13,990
mighty cheetahs and they can take a

301
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:17,770
beating but there is a still a long way

302
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:23,650
to go that's Daisy and I've been working

303
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:26,050
on a four-legged robot for some time

304
00:17:26,050 --> 00:17:30,040
it's called Felix and my goal was to

305
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:33,670
create a simple and cheap lake robot the

306
00:17:33,670 --> 00:17:38,560
kids out there tend to be a complex and

307
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:40,210
use a lot of servers

308
00:17:40,210 --> 00:17:42,909
and actually I think that kind of creepy

309
00:17:42,909 --> 00:17:49,899
and my goal was to create a robot with

310
00:17:49,899 --> 00:17:53,710
eight servers and the challenge

311
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:56,320
challenge there was to explore the types

312
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,840
of gates that were as possible with only

313
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:05,309
eight degrees of freedom the system

314
00:18:05,309 --> 00:18:09,429
space um in adrenal you know I have a

315
00:18:09,429 --> 00:18:12,309
server control chip some sensors on the

316
00:18:12,309 --> 00:18:19,270
adrenal we have free matter which live

317
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:24,220
as firmware and the fermata talks to

318
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:29,289
join a 5-over socket our air all over

319
00:18:29,289 --> 00:18:32,890
the serial port on top I'm using spray

320
00:18:32,890 --> 00:18:37,899
CS and socket i/o to provide the UI so

321
00:18:37,899 --> 00:18:42,010
when you have to learn to get a

322
00:18:42,010 --> 00:18:46,120
four-legged robot walking you need where

323
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:52,159
there are three steps or you need 3 a 3

324
00:18:52,169 --> 00:18:54,760
parts of your code one part will be

325
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:58,990
dealing with the position of of your

326
00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:01,990
feet because you don't want to deal with

327
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:05,460
the rotation angles you just want to

328
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:09,659
decide where you place the foot and then

329
00:19:09,659 --> 00:19:14,110
calculate the angles using trigonometry

330
00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:17,230
and then you want to do some motion

331
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:22,149
planning like how is your step going to

332
00:19:22,149 --> 00:19:24,340
work you have a track you have a lift

333
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:28,630
and then you combine these motions into

334
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:36,820
gates mmm now will do fellas will do a

335
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:44,090
bit of walking and

336
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:51,030
I think he's better can you see him is

337
00:19:51,030 --> 00:20:15,979
cease on the floor is possible team

338
00:20:15,989 --> 00:20:24,190
and you can see this sensors they map

339
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:27,759
the distance and tell him not to bump

340
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:29,529
into anything there's a lot of light

341
00:20:29,529 --> 00:20:31,599
here so he's quite confused as you can

342
00:20:31,599 --> 00:20:36,190
see but let's see if he managed to do

343
00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:46,179
some walking speak enough again the UI

344
00:20:46,179 --> 00:20:51,819
is talking is talking to the Arduino

345
00:20:51,819 --> 00:20:57,699
using socket i/o and this is a creeping

346
00:20:57,699 --> 00:21:02,909
gate I can tell him to walk forward stop

347
00:21:02,909 --> 00:21:06,219
sort of go backward you didn't want to

348
00:21:06,219 --> 00:21:08,469
go backward you're a bit not no I didn't

349
00:21:08,469 --> 00:21:11,559
want it you know well he still has to go

350
00:21:11,559 --> 00:21:15,279
forward he can turn around the thing is

351
00:21:15,279 --> 00:21:18,429
that because he doesn't have the right

352
00:21:18,429 --> 00:21:24,190
number of a mobility in the car sir he

353
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:28,959
is constrained so when he when he wants

354
00:21:28,959 --> 00:21:32,799
to turn what he does is that he take

355
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:36,940
small step steps with the lake at that

356
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:43,640
side he wants to turn to and he can sit

357
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:50,190
and he can day and he has also another

358
00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:53,220
gate which is the trot which is sort of

359
00:21:53,220 --> 00:22:22,540
a weird tapping dance let me so

360
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:32,360
and this is the little brother it's

361
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:37,430
using a smaller servos with not much

362
00:22:37,430 --> 00:22:44,330
torque and the idea is to develop this

363
00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:49,400
into kids that you can play with with

364
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:52,970
children or all the people at least in

365
00:22:52,970 --> 00:22:55,730
the hackerspace kids really like to play

366
00:22:55,730 --> 00:22:58,340
with this stuff because you can use the

367
00:22:58,340 --> 00:23:03,970
sensors to for instance he stops when

368
00:23:03,970 --> 00:23:06,550
