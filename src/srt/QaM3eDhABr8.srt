1
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:34,300

so my name is a ray Morgan I'm not sure

2
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:36,100
if who knows me and who doesn't i was

3
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:38,980
actually here last year and I I spoke in

4
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:40,930
the bee track but probably no one knew

5
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:43,420
that because in the a track Brendan Eich

6
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:47,440
was talking so I think I had four people

7
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:48,850
five people and most of them were there

8
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:50,110
just like talking about the previous

9
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:53,500
talk so alright so today I'm going to

10
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:57,790
talk about app versus web but before I

11
00:00:57,790 --> 00:00:59,080
do I want to lay down a couple

12
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:02,140
definitions of what I'm talking about

13
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:03,970
when I'm saying app and web just so that

14
00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:05,290
we're all in the same page here and we

15
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:07,990
can all understand each other so when

16
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:09,460
I'm speaking about apps I'm talking

17
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:11,680
about native apps written and usually a

18
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,470
compiled language and these are things

19
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:17,320
like objective-c apps or Java apps for

20
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:20,890
Android and when I'm talking about web

21
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:23,200
i'm talking about applications or web

22
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,899
pages that are written in HTML CSS and

23
00:01:25,899 --> 00:01:27,430
JavaScript I'm not so I'm not talking

24
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:29,979
about web is a protocol for native apps

25
00:01:29,979 --> 00:01:35,950
but actual web applications so here's

26
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:37,390
the two camps and I thought this was

27
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:38,289
interesting because this is one of those

28
00:01:38,289 --> 00:01:39,130
things that people are going to look

29
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:41,380
back on us and we're going to be known

30
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:45,100
for killing terrorists and World of

31
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:48,700
Warcraft so I think that's awesome but

32
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:50,229
so the two camps here this is actually

33
00:01:50,229 --> 00:01:53,560
on the on your left we have a native app

34
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:56,050
this is the YouTube app obviously and on

35
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:58,780
the right we have the web application so

36
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:01,599
there's two different ideas when it

37
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:03,520
comes to what this what we should be

38
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:07,030
doing and you usually fall in either one

39
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:09,490
of the other camps the native app guys

40
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:11,080
they're like oh the web sucks and you

41
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:13,420
can't really do anything with it it's

42
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:14,890
limited we can't get all the cool

43
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:17,590
features of native stuff and then on the

44
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:21,610
other side the web guys we claim that we

45
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:23,530
can do anything you guys can do but

46
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:25,330
better faster and we don't have to learn

47
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:31,510
crazy languages and ID's so once upon a

48
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:34,390
time I was a front-end developer my work

49
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:37,450
for zappos com and i've been doing

50
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:39,489
front-end development there for about

51
00:02:39,489 --> 00:02:42,790
four years now and really have a strong

52
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:45,550
passion for web technologies so when

53
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:49,000
when I first started we were still using

54
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,880
tables and stuff like that and

55
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:53,050
throughout the the years we've moved

56
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:57,720
over to you know semantic stuff and I

57
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:01,480
actually got a opportunity last year to

58
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:04,690
start working on native apps so I kind

59
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:06,820
of was tinkering with Objective C stuff

60
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:12,010
and so last August I was approached to

61
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:13,780
it's like hey you want to work on a on

62
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:15,190
the iPad app we're going to work on the

63
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:19,960
iPad app and I said sure so I kind of

64
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,250
have an interesting background I think

65
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:23,080
I've been working a lot of front-end

66
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,910
development but I also do native app

67
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:28,630
development so I'm not I'm not fully on

68
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:29,980
one side or the other I think that

69
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:32,200
there's a strong balance that we should

70
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:35,950
be striking between the two and so the

71
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:37,900
the first app we worked on was the ipad

72
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:39,280
app and i had been tinkering with

73
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,650
Objective C for probably about three

74
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:43,330
weeks maybe four weeks prior to that I

75
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:46,750
don't no idea why they let me do this so

76
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:48,370
it was me and one other guy that had

77
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:50,380
some experience so we kind of just start

78
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:54,130
hacking on it and we we release the

79
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:56,620
first version eight weeks later and this

80
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:57,940
is a full shopping app where you can

81
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:01,030
browse search view products choose your

82
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:03,010
size with color check out everything

83
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:06,340
like that and it was a native app on for

84
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:08,170
the iphone and at the same time I just

85
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:10,180
want to give a shout out to the are our

86
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:12,850
one API developer at the same time we

87
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:14,260
would do it we were making our Zappos

88
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:18,100
API so this whole thing was kind of a

89
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:21,160
crazy rush to get it out eight weeks we

90
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,980
made a native app and a full API so just

91
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:25,780
if you ever make it an API for anyone I

92
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:28,360
highly recommend making a real app or

93
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:30,820
real something with it and don't just

94
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:32,860
kind of think you know what you get what

95
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:36,850
your users are going to want so the the

96
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:40,060
point of that story is that native apps

97
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:41,950
aren't hard that aren't that hard to

98
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:45,730
write and this is kind of I think a hot

99
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:47,470
topic where you know as web developers

100
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:49,660
we think that this native platform is

101
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:52,390
impossible that we shouldn't even try

102
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:54,490
because why when we can just do web

103
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:58,150
stuff i have i've had people come up to

104
00:04:58,150 --> 00:04:59,500
me saying that they

105
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,240
been working on like these iphone apps

106
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,760
and that was their first programming

107
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,350
language that was a first introduction

108
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:09,720
to programming was these iOS and Android

109
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:12,460
apps and one of the reasons that makes

110
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:14,590
it really really easy is all the

111
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:16,870
documentation the documentation I don't

112
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:18,250
know if anyone's ever googled anything

113
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:21,280
for like objective-c it's it's

114
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,530
phenomenal there's probably like

115
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:25,570
hundreds of hours of videos I'm just the

116
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:28,510
WWDC talks from last year and then also

117
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:32,110
the Stanford classes and you google

118
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:35,610
anything and you get probably 27 or 30

119
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:38,590
Stack Overflow questions and answers and

120
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:41,740
it's it's it's great and to demonstrate

121
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:43,450
this I'm actually gonna try something

122
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:44,800
I've never done before and it's probably

123
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,880
going to crash and burn so I have a

124
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,140
back-up plan if it does but I'm actually

125
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:50,169
going to live code a objective-c app a

126
00:05:50,169 --> 00:05:53,740
really simple one so let's see how this

127
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:59,260
works that's not what I wanted yeah

128
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:03,760
we'll figure that out later okay so how

129
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,620
many here have actually written any kind

130
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:08,140
of native apps so objective-c apps with

131
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:10,780
Objective C first awesome awesome so

132
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:14,979
maybe 40 people what about like a native

133
00:06:14,979 --> 00:06:17,950
android apps java about the same number

134
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:23,919
what about windows mobile apps too okay

135
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:29,110
we're good all right so if you haven't

136
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:31,270
if you've never done this don't worry

137
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:35,710
it's not what too scary so I'm just

138
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:37,680
gonna create a new project xcode is a

139
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,410
weird tool that is good and bad at a you

140
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:43,060
hate it you love it it's one of the

141
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:44,440
things so I'm just going to choose this

142
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:46,510
a creative you base of you base is just

143
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:52,660
a very kind of doesn't really give you

144
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:59,080
much by default but alright i guess i

145
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,490
can't change use the same name there we

146
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:03,360
go all right

147
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,020
so it's going to stay up a little

148
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:06,550
structure a little project structure for

149
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:09,039
me I don't have to really do that so I

150
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:12,489
got kind of two files here which is the

151
00:07:12,489 --> 00:07:14,580
main kind of entry to the application

152
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:18,429
echo to view controller hmm and then i

153
00:07:18,429 --> 00:07:21,580
have this xib file or a nib is what they

154
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:25,050
use to be called so if you've ever done

155
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:27,819
see development this is very similar you

156
00:07:27,819 --> 00:07:28,929
have the header file and then the actual

157
00:07:28,929 --> 00:07:36,209
implementation file oh right right oh

158
00:07:36,209 --> 00:07:39,969
man I have no idea how to do that here

159
00:07:39,969 --> 00:07:42,990
we'll just dude this way how about that

160
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:50,909
I'll just code like this yeah it didn't

161
00:07:50,909 --> 00:07:53,529
yeah neither those that's what I'm used

162
00:07:53,529 --> 00:07:57,669
to yupo you know I ex good see this is

163
00:07:57,669 --> 00:07:59,050
what I'm talking about they do things a

164
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:01,360
little different I'm gonna go do fonts

165
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:08,499
oh wow look at that they have a theme

166
00:08:08,499 --> 00:08:13,769
just for this hey nice that's awesome

167
00:08:13,769 --> 00:08:16,769
alright so here we go we're just gonna

168
00:08:16,769 --> 00:08:20,079
let's do an IB I'll kind of explain what

169
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:22,419
some of this means as i go and some i

170
00:08:22,419 --> 00:08:28,240
won't so an iboutlet IBTimes for

171
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,740
interface builder which will explore in

172
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:31,360
a little bit i be outlet is just a way

173
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,550
to hook into something that you build

174
00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:35,919
with interface builder so um so I be

175
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:40,930
outlet let's just UI label so we're

176
00:08:40,930 --> 00:08:42,459
gonna make it we're going to use a label

177
00:08:42,459 --> 00:08:45,220
i'm going to call it label will make two

178
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:46,660
of these but this one's going to be a UI

179
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:52,180
text field not that there we go and this

180
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:56,670
one's just going to be called Chi field

181
00:08:56,670 --> 00:09:01,480
alright and then just copy this so these

182
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,120
so i'm doing here is i'm just defining

183
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,769
properties on this class so the class is

184
00:09:05,769 --> 00:09:07,350
to find with the at interface a

185
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:09,819
directive and i'm just defining

186
00:09:09,819 --> 00:09:11,199
properties that are in that class so

187
00:09:11,199 --> 00:09:15,550
this one will have a label and a a text

188
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:16,570
field these are

189
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:18,400
two variables and then you also have to

190
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,500
do this weird thing to kind of tell

191
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,780
objective-c to give you gathers and

192
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:25,150
setters so you can properly use these

193
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:32,280
things so i'ma do not Tom 'ok retain

194
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:36,310
copy this so non-atomic is just a

195
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:38,710
keyword to whenever you change the

196
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:42,340
property of label anything about it

197
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:45,430
it'll make sure it's or non-atomic will

198
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:47,380
make sure it's not thread-safe atomic

199
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:48,940
will make it thread-safe atomic slower

200
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:51,220
you don't really use it too much of iOS

201
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:52,510
development may be in Mac development

202
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:55,300
may be in very specific places and then

203
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:56,770
one more thing I want to do is I want to

204
00:09:56,770 --> 00:10:00,640
do I want to add one function and this

205
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,800
you the same thing I'd be action it's

206
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,180
kind of like outlets it's a I think it

207
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:06,040
is a going to event listener it allows

208
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,660
you hook up events so this is going to

209
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:12,400
be when a button espresso lon button

210
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:22,060
press and then uh you have been yeah

211
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:25,510
whatever okay so what i'm doing here is

212
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:27,280
to kind of defining the header of it i

213
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:32,950
know i did that wrong backwards boom

214
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:35,830
okay so I'm just defining that I will

215
00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:38,110
have a function called on button press

216
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:42,910
and it returns the type Ib action which

217
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:45,340
is actually null but it's like a fancy

218
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:48,280
key word and I'm gonna get one argument

219
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,780
to that function and it's going to be

220
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:53,830
the button that was pressed and that's

221
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:55,690
all I need to do in this file so I'm

222
00:10:55,690 --> 00:10:56,680
going to switch over to the

223
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:57,880
implementation file this is where your

224
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,800
all your actual code is you'll see a

225
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:00,840
bunch of stuff in there that doesn't

226
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:03,850
that apple auto generates and mostly

227
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:06,220
doesn't matter for us today so I'm a

228
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:08,650
synthesized synthesized is this stupid

229
00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:11,830
thing you have to do that lets you it

230
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:13,150
like actually creates the getters and

231
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:16,030
setters I don't know why I do both at

232
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:20,920
property and at synthesized dumb see so

233
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:24,160
label and tea fields so this is just

234
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:27,310
saying those from these guys these

235
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:29,140
properties here is label and text fields

236
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:29,950
I

237
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:33,010
actually do want to use them so do that

238
00:11:33,010 --> 00:11:34,780
and one more thing whenever you do an

239
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:37,660
iboutlet you also have to set them to

240
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:39,820
new on viewed it and unload for memory

241
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:44,290
management and these are just kind of

242
00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:46,060
things that you just you pick up really

243
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:47,380
quick there these are kind of tedious

244
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:49,840
little little things setting up

245
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:52,110
variables i wish it was just VAR but

246
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:55,060
piled languages stack p type what can

247
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:58,870
you do all right so um the last thing my

248
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:00,130
doing this file my do i'm just going to

249
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:02,530
take this guy i'm going to copy it over

250
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:06,370
to wherever so the class definition is

251
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:07,540
kind of hard to see but it's from this

252
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:10,360
implementation down to this at end they

253
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:12,520
don't like it's like weird C syntax

254
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:15,190
mixed with Objective C syntax so the at

255
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:17,590
signs or like this are like that block

256
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:19,960
right there so the ad implementation and

257
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:24,250
yeah so I'm going to define this this uh

258
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:26,320
this action right here and all I want to

259
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,540
do is whatever is in the text box I want

260
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:30,940
to put into the label so I'm just gonna

261
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:37,600
do self dot label dot txt so that's the

262
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,190
actual text property so when i change

263
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:41,920
that the view will change and the view

264
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,750
is kind of like the element and i want

265
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:48,990
to set that equal to soft t field text

266
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:52,750
simple enough so take the text from the

267
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:54,760
text fields and put it into the text of

268
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:57,790
the label alright so if we run it right

269
00:12:57,790 --> 00:13:02,470
now everything is not done because we

270
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:04,930
don't have any view all we have is the

271
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:07,900
code for the view it'll actually compile

272
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:09,760
run everything like that we just don't

273
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:13,420
have anything I put the simulator down

274
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:17,080
here later so yeah we have an empty gray

275
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:20,170
barring projective see up so let's just

276
00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:23,500
jump into this nib and I'm going to add

277
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:31,270
just loads all right a label I'm going

278
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:37,480
to add a button I'm gonna add a button

279
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:41,820
there it is and i'm going to add that

280
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:54,519
text fields ok and alice is going so

281
00:13:54,519 --> 00:14:01,220
slow

282
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:04,380
alright alright so now we have the the

283
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:07,410
elements on the screen just it types

284
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:10,470
really slow and so now all we need to do

285
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:12,180
is kind of connect the pieces so we have

286
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:13,830
the elements but they're not connected

287
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:16,530
to those references so when you push

288
00:14:16,530 --> 00:14:17,460
this button it's not going to do

289
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:19,490
anything it's like if as if you put a

290
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:22,140
button element on an HTML page into any

291
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:23,400
JavaScript it's just going to be a

292
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:24,840
button they can press it's not very

293
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:28,290
exciting so hook up the this stuff all

294
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:30,420
we have to do is magic clicking so

295
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:31,920
control dragging from what's called

296
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,320
files owner which is this weird name for

297
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,540
the class that that view that we made

298
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:39,750
the data echo to view controller so I'm

299
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:42,330
gonna drag this down to the label and it

300
00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:45,270
says hey here's an outlet barely see it

301
00:14:45,270 --> 00:14:47,340
it lists out all the outlets that those

302
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:49,410
ib outlets that we made and it already

303
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:51,750
filters down to the only the UI label

304
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:55,170
outlets because you can't connect a text

305
00:14:55,170 --> 00:14:57,720
outlet to a label outlet and things like

306
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:01,020
that because that would be weird I'm

307
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:02,520
gonna do the same thing for text field

308
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:06,480
and then also for the button press go

309
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,250
this way so that when you press the

310
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:11,430
button we want to send the event the

311
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:13,890
event of on button press so we set all

312
00:15:13,890 --> 00:15:16,050
that up already we're just connecting it

313
00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:21,780
and now if the if everything went

314
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:32,199
according to plan we should

315
00:15:32,209 --> 00:15:35,630
we should have a really really slow

316
00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:41,079
loading application um out there yeah

317
00:15:41,089 --> 00:15:45,959
ojs calm and we press it and there's the

318
00:15:45,959 --> 00:15:48,089
text you'll notice it just did something

319
00:15:48,089 --> 00:15:50,339
weird there it made it small and ellipse

320
00:15:50,339 --> 00:15:56,370
ellipse don't know how sad word so let's

321
00:15:56,370 --> 00:15:59,550
make that a little bigger so when you

322
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:03,600
run again it'll actually work as

323
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:10,050
expected so now if we do ljs calm boom

324
00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:17,959
hello Jas conf thank you thank you Apple

325
00:16:17,959 --> 00:16:20,850
so that that's kind of a really basic

326
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:23,310
intro to objective c programming it

327
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:26,550
weird syntax crazy weird syntax but all

328
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:29,790
together it's not that hard it takes it

329
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:31,019
may be a little bit of ramp up but

330
00:16:31,019 --> 00:16:32,699
there's a lot of good documentation on

331
00:16:32,699 --> 00:16:36,180
it and a lot of a lot of people that are

332
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:38,610
interested in this so you can probably

333
00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:40,380
find people to help you out and teach

334
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:42,600
you some stuff I highly recommend it on

335
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:46,019
one of my big passions besides a front

336
00:16:46,019 --> 00:16:47,970
end dev and like mobile dev is just kind

337
00:16:47,970 --> 00:16:51,870
of looking into languages and i highly

338
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:53,759
recommend looking into some languages if

339
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:55,259
javascript is like your primary language

340
00:16:55,259 --> 00:16:57,120
or if you've been using javascript and

341
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,519
say Ruby I would look into some other

342
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:01,829
languages just to kind of see what else

343
00:17:01,829 --> 00:17:03,329
is out there and how they do things I

344
00:17:03,329 --> 00:17:05,069
think it will really help the community

345
00:17:05,069 --> 00:17:07,079
as a whole to see how other communities

346
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:09,510
and other languages and frameworks work

347
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:11,490
and how people have been doing these

348
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:13,890
things so it's like objective seat on a

349
00:17:13,890 --> 00:17:15,539
Mac development they've been doing this

350
00:17:15,539 --> 00:17:17,039
forever so we can probably learn a lot

351
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:21,959
from them all right so that's a that's

352
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:23,970
that demo let's go back to here see if I

353
00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:26,939
can so yeah native apps they're not not

354
00:17:26,939 --> 00:17:29,309
that hard you can figure it out it takes

355
00:17:29,309 --> 00:17:30,419
a little bit tom a little bit overhead

356
00:17:30,419 --> 00:17:32,490
but i think most people could figure it

357
00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:35,940
out and the second point on that one is

358
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:38,400
native apps are easy to get performant

359
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,169
and i think this is something we take

360
00:17:40,169 --> 00:17:43,410
for granted is that

361
00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:45,300
when you're developing these native apps

362
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:48,180
they do so much for you for free when it

363
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:49,550
comes to performance when it comes to

364
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:52,440
rendering speed actions like how long

365
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:56,670
the things take to like run and this

366
00:17:56,670 --> 00:17:58,470
might not this isn't is isn't as big of

367
00:17:58,470 --> 00:18:00,510
a deal i think in the in the mobile web

368
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:03,000
community and it should be a lot bigger

369
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,460
of a deal so like one of the things like

370
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:06,690
i'm sure everyone's seen the objectives

371
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:08,430
like like a native app where it scrolls

372
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:10,050
i'm not sure if android does this or if

373
00:18:10,050 --> 00:18:11,160
they're working on another working on a

374
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:15,080
bunch of like GPU stuff in a 23 and 30

375
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:17,940
but Apple does some really crazy stuff

376
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:21,240
where they they actually so if the if

377
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,860
you're scrolling if you if you flick up

378
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:25,410
in the in a Cell moves off screen they

379
00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:27,750
actually take it out of the out of the

380
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:30,240
rendering path and they give you a

381
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,740
chance to reuse it so you can actually

382
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:34,020
get a real ik handle to it and push it

383
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:35,730
and it'll push it onto the bottom of it

384
00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:37,320
and so it's like it's like the cycle

385
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:39,750
that they do and it's so that they don't

386
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:42,240
have to do any kind of new object

387
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,660
allocation it's it's really and you

388
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:47,010
don't have to worry about it's all under

389
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:50,370
the hood and it's actually kind of hard

390
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:52,200
especially with these newer phones and

391
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,150
the new iPad it's hard to make an appt

392
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:56,730
not get high frame rate and what I'm

393
00:18:56,730 --> 00:18:58,140
saying high frame rate i'm talking 60

394
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:00,120
frames a second i'm not talking you know

395
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:02,130
30 frames a second i'm talking 60 frames

396
00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:05,010
a second so this is something that is

397
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:08,940
really big um so this lasts this last

398
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:11,430
year after working we released the ipad

399
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:13,320
app the iphone app and android app all

400
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:16,440
within five months of each other there's

401
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:18,600
there was three of us work this three of

402
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:21,630
us working on it and so at the end of

403
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:24,450
the the the android cycle we were

404
00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:26,970
working on a mobile website our design

405
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:28,950
resource at the time was kind of

406
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:31,620
consumed by the android platform and

407
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:34,350
working on that so you know as being a

408
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:38,790
high and mighty web dev i decided that i

409
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:40,980
would just you know copy some of the

410
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:43,590
stuff we don't from the apps we can do

411
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:45,810
this it's a the mobile web is awesome we

412
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:48,090
can make this happen so I start writing

413
00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:50,520
another yet another micro framework that

414
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:52,440
was more perfectly suited for mine

415
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:54,210
situations and I liked reinventing

416
00:19:54,210 --> 00:19:56,999
wheels so we

417
00:19:56,999 --> 00:20:00,539
I work on this and about a month or not

418
00:20:00,539 --> 00:20:03,479
a month two weeks into it two or three I

419
00:20:03,479 --> 00:20:06,359
kind of have this breakdown because the

420
00:20:06,359 --> 00:20:08,609
this mobile site you know you're

421
00:20:08,609 --> 00:20:09,929
flipping through it you're using it's

422
00:20:09,929 --> 00:20:11,939
cool there's some stuff but it's just

423
00:20:11,939 --> 00:20:14,489
wrong it just feels it feels like a

424
00:20:14,489 --> 00:20:16,799
crappy version of our iPhone app and I

425
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:18,029
don't want a crappy version of our

426
00:20:18,029 --> 00:20:22,199
iphone app I want a sweet mobile website

427
00:20:22,199 --> 00:20:26,519
and so this this brings me to the next

428
00:20:26,519 --> 00:20:28,109
point and I want to really ask this

429
00:20:28,109 --> 00:20:30,809
question should mobile web really be

430
00:20:30,809 --> 00:20:33,509
trying to emulate native apps and I

431
00:20:33,509 --> 00:20:35,339
think this is a very interesting topic

432
00:20:35,339 --> 00:20:37,589
and something that I think not everyone

433
00:20:37,589 --> 00:20:39,809
is really asking themselves like why are

434
00:20:39,809 --> 00:20:42,749
we trying to emulate everything native

435
00:20:42,749 --> 00:20:45,929
apps are trying to do is that right does

436
00:20:45,929 --> 00:20:47,969
it feel right when you go to a website a

437
00:20:47,969 --> 00:20:51,149
mobile on your mobile phone and you end

438
00:20:51,149 --> 00:20:53,249
up going and it looks kind of like a

439
00:20:53,249 --> 00:20:55,769
native app but not really like how many

440
00:20:55,769 --> 00:20:57,809
you have that experience where you get

441
00:20:57,809 --> 00:20:59,579
to a page and it's just it's confusing

442
00:20:59,579 --> 00:21:01,049
or it's just frustrating because they

443
00:21:01,049 --> 00:21:04,109
tried so hard to make it native that it

444
00:21:04,109 --> 00:21:05,999
just doesn't work and that could be

445
00:21:05,999 --> 00:21:07,799
anything from performance to just

446
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:13,469
strange scrolling to just awkward design

447
00:21:13,469 --> 00:21:19,169
and then the other thing is it takes a

448
00:21:19,169 --> 00:21:22,049
lot of code to do that the I was so I

449
00:21:22,049 --> 00:21:23,219
was writing this little micro framework

450
00:21:23,219 --> 00:21:24,749
but it was still a lot of code it was

451
00:21:24,749 --> 00:21:26,369
probably getting around eight eight

452
00:21:26,369 --> 00:21:27,839
hundred lines of code to do some of this

453
00:21:27,839 --> 00:21:30,149
stuff and I just like SAT back and I was

454
00:21:30,149 --> 00:21:33,629
like this is not the right path it just

455
00:21:33,629 --> 00:21:35,129
is something as simple as a back button

456
00:21:35,129 --> 00:21:36,989
you know we take a backbone for granted

457
00:21:36,989 --> 00:21:39,239
in the browser and sometimes we think

458
00:21:39,239 --> 00:21:40,619
that the backbone is just to get you to

459
00:21:40,619 --> 00:21:43,259
the previous page but it's not just to

460
00:21:43,259 --> 00:21:45,029
get you to the previous page it does a

461
00:21:45,029 --> 00:21:46,679
lot more than that if you if you really

462
00:21:46,679 --> 00:21:49,919
take note of it it one thing is if

463
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:51,479
you're strolling if you scroll down and

464
00:21:51,479 --> 00:21:52,889
you hit back you'll get back to that

465
00:21:52,889 --> 00:21:55,079
that part of the page where you scroll

466
00:21:55,079 --> 00:21:57,929
to this is very important and we

467
00:21:57,929 --> 00:22:00,029
actually had a I'm gonna call it a bug

468
00:22:00,029 --> 00:22:02,099
went live on the zappos a year or two

469
00:22:02,099 --> 00:22:05,399
ago and it in Firefox who kind of busted

470
00:22:05,399 --> 00:22:07,559
that mentality and it's scroll people at

471
00:22:07,559 --> 00:22:08,489
the top so they be scrolling through

472
00:22:08,489 --> 00:22:09,719
searches I click something they hit back

473
00:22:09,719 --> 00:22:10,500
and they be

474
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:14,340
top we got tons of complaints and this

475
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:15,780
is something that you might not think

476
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:18,780
about but it's a huge deal and we don't

477
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:20,280
get a lot of a lot of complaints when it

478
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:22,080
comes to technical things and that was

479
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,960
really eye-opening and another thing is

480
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,370
it doesn't just bring you back to the

481
00:22:26,370 --> 00:22:28,440
previous point in the page because if

482
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:31,470
that was all if that was all it was we

483
00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:34,230
can solve this but it also brings you

484
00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:35,640
back to the previous point of the page

485
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:38,790
with the current state of that page so

486
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:41,550
if you ever use a like a mobile website

487
00:22:41,550 --> 00:22:44,100
no take note of JavaScript that ran on

488
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:47,310
that page go to the next page hit the

489
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:48,690
back button and see what the state of

490
00:22:48,690 --> 00:22:51,180
the page is like it actually captures a

491
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:52,890
lot of like what the current state is

492
00:22:52,890 --> 00:22:54,750
and so this is something that's very

493
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:56,250
hard and you'd have to write a lot of

494
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:58,770
custom code for your app this is

495
00:22:58,770 --> 00:23:00,240
something a framework cannot handle

496
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,490
because it have to run it have to run

497
00:23:02,490 --> 00:23:05,100
very specific code for your app to get

498
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:09,780
it back in the same state and I just

499
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:11,310
think it leads to a lot of broken

500
00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:15,210
expectation expectations you know what

501
00:23:15,210 --> 00:23:16,470
are you designed just as simple as what

502
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:17,490
are you designing for are you designing

503
00:23:17,490 --> 00:23:19,950
for an iphone are you designing for an

504
00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:22,020
Android Windows Mobile which is even

505
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:23,790
more different than both of them they

506
00:23:23,790 --> 00:23:25,170
you know where do you put the back

507
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:26,850
button do you put at the top do you not

508
00:23:26,850 --> 00:23:28,260
put a back button because Android users

509
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:29,160
don't like back buttons I have a

510
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:31,440
background on the phone do you put the

511
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,970
tab bar at the bottom you put it at the

512
00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:35,120
top you know all these things are very

513
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:37,680
the each of these devices are very

514
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:41,520
specific you I kind of mentalities and

515
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,960
how they do things and I think that's

516
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:45,780
that's important that we try not to

517
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:48,320
break these expectations of what these

518
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,940
of these things and if we're trying to

519
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:53,390
emulate native apps this is hard because

520
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:56,340
they do things certain ways and if we're

521
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:57,750
trying to emulate all that it's just not

522
00:23:57,750 --> 00:24:02,610
going to work so this leads me to my my

523
00:24:02,610 --> 00:24:05,430
main point here is let's get back to the

524
00:24:05,430 --> 00:24:08,250
basics of the web a lot of times as

525
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:11,130
developers we really want to try to do

526
00:24:11,130 --> 00:24:14,400
something awesome right we really want

527
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,020
to push the envelope and I think there's

528
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:17,220
a place for that I think there's a place

529
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:18,960
for a lot of these tools I'm there was a

530
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,550
few talks yesterday on then they're

531
00:24:20,550 --> 00:24:23,190
absolutely have like the world of

532
00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:24,410
respect for these guys because

533
00:24:24,410 --> 00:24:26,480
I've been doing web mobile web

534
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,710
development for the last month and man I

535
00:24:27,710 --> 00:24:29,450
want to pull my hair out it's it's

536
00:24:29,450 --> 00:24:30,860
ridiculous some of these bugs that you

537
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:35,780
have to deal with and and so they try

538
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:36,980
their don't try and do these things and

539
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:39,530
I think if we just get back to the

540
00:24:39,530 --> 00:24:41,390
basics of what the web was all about and

541
00:24:41,390 --> 00:24:45,160
what was that what did it used to be

542
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:48,860
semantic HTML like what ever happened to

543
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:51,020
that like where's the notion that we

544
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:52,460
should be still be building semantic

545
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:56,780
HTML websites I think there is also a

546
00:24:56,780 --> 00:24:58,280
place for some of these crazy things and

547
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:00,620
uh I'm glad that Google and some other

548
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:02,150
guys are stepping up with some of these

549
00:25:02,150 --> 00:25:04,250
like crazy like hash bang specs um I

550
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:05,570
don't know what you're standing on that

551
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:07,370
but I think it's at the very least it

552
00:25:07,370 --> 00:25:10,160
allows us to do certain things that we

553
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:12,680
weren't able to do before so I think

554
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:14,120
there's a place for than that but some

555
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:15,290
of these things they just you know you

556
00:25:15,290 --> 00:25:16,790
write JavaScript it just generates all

557
00:25:16,790 --> 00:25:19,880
your HTML and while there's a place for

558
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:21,350
that and as you saw in the objective-c

559
00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:24,650
that's kind of how it is it's just it's

560
00:25:24,650 --> 00:25:27,140
it just feels wrong and you have to

561
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:29,090
learn a lot to be able to write in those

562
00:25:29,090 --> 00:25:31,160
frameworks and I'd argue why not just

563
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:32,690
learn native app development if you're

564
00:25:32,690 --> 00:25:33,920
trying to make a native app I understand

565
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:35,780
you have to make 18 different devices

566
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:39,680
but you don't really just the next one

567
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:42,350
is a progressive enhancement this is

568
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:45,860
another one those sites that run like

569
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:47,030
that they're only going to run on the

570
00:25:47,030 --> 00:25:49,610
newest platforms and with this one I'm

571
00:25:49,610 --> 00:25:50,510
not saying you have to support

572
00:25:50,510 --> 00:25:52,280
everything I don't I don't think you do

573
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:54,380
you have to know your user base so let's

574
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:55,810
a pose we actually kind of lucky because

575
00:25:55,810 --> 00:25:58,960
we really only have two types of devices

576
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:01,580
shopping on the mobile website which is

577
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:05,270
iphone and android i think we had six

578
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:08,150
blackberry request last week and i think

579
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:09,170
i know the guy that was doing that

580
00:26:09,170 --> 00:26:11,500
because he bugs me about it every day so

581
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:13,640
you don't have to support everything you

582
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:14,930
just gotta support you have to support

583
00:26:14,930 --> 00:26:18,110
your users but not all your iPhone users

584
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:21,380
are on iphone 4s you know not all your

585
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:24,350
your Android users have the latest and

586
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:30,200
greatest droid x2 or whatever that it's

587
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:35,990
it's a very it's we as developers we

588
00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:37,490
usually have some of these latest

589
00:26:37,490 --> 00:26:38,240
technologies

590
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,700
if you don't test it on these older ones

591
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:43,850
I I would you would see that things

592
00:26:43,850 --> 00:26:46,460
aren't what all peachy and nice so if

593
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:47,720
when you're using some if you are

594
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:50,120
thinking about using some of these these

595
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:52,100
all-in-one apps things I would really

596
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:53,809
highly recommend actually finding

597
00:26:53,809 --> 00:26:56,240
someone with like an old iphone iphone

598
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,520
to iphone 3 an android that's not the

599
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:00,980
latest one maybe it's maybe there's a

600
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:03,260
latest one but it's just a low-cost one

601
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:05,780
and really try some of those those

602
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:08,870
things out on them because it's it's not

603
00:27:08,870 --> 00:27:11,090
always as performing is you would like

604
00:27:11,090 --> 00:27:12,710
and sometimes it's it's borderline

605
00:27:12,710 --> 00:27:16,510
unusable and that brings me to usability

606
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:19,700
I think this is a very very important

607
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:21,710
point so when you're designing these

608
00:27:21,710 --> 00:27:24,020
things what do you design for as i said

609
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:27,020
iphone or android but i think if we kind

610
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:28,730
of abstract away from that and we kind

611
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:31,760
we did this with a kind of when kind of

612
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,650
web two point O was all catching on and

613
00:27:33,650 --> 00:27:35,240
everyone was going on that we kind of

614
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:36,520
started making these really heavily

615
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:40,000
desktop like apps and I think we've

616
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,050
realized that that is not what the web

617
00:27:42,050 --> 00:27:44,450
should be we stopped doing that and you

618
00:27:44,450 --> 00:27:48,020
get a lot of much simpler applications

619
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:49,910
come out of that and people are more

620
00:27:49,910 --> 00:27:53,960
used to certain mindsets when they're

621
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:55,580
browsing on the mobile devices and when

622
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:58,670
they're using the web and so I think

623
00:27:58,670 --> 00:28:00,110
usability is an important point that we

624
00:28:00,110 --> 00:28:02,540
need to really keep this in mind user

625
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:05,630
bill is designed around making a usable

626
00:28:05,630 --> 00:28:08,990
app and also simplicity I really really

627
00:28:08,990 --> 00:28:12,890
really love simple things complicated

628
00:28:12,890 --> 00:28:17,540
things frustrate me a lot and so if we

629
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:19,400
go back to what the web was all about

630
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:22,130
it's all about some simple ideas you

631
00:28:22,130 --> 00:28:24,170
know links should be links they should

632
00:28:24,170 --> 00:28:26,330
take you to pages they we shouldn't be

633
00:28:26,330 --> 00:28:29,390
trying to wrap this concept of the

634
00:28:29,390 --> 00:28:33,020
native app around this web model and

635
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:36,050
other things things such as a be testing

636
00:28:36,050 --> 00:28:39,260
and Google Analytics i'm sure most

637
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:42,080
places want analytics on your pages how

638
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,370
do you do this with those type of things

639
00:28:43,370 --> 00:28:45,350
you can probably do it but you would

640
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:47,090
have to write custom code for all of

641
00:28:47,090 --> 00:28:48,980
that stuff you can't just drop it in

642
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:50,820
like you used to be able to so

643
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:56,789
um yeah that's that was that point so

644
00:28:56,789 --> 00:28:58,200
that's kind of that part now I want to

645
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:01,049
go into a quick demo of some of the

646
00:29:01,049 --> 00:29:02,130
stuff we've been doing some other sites

647
00:29:02,130 --> 00:29:06,000
and then jump into some kind of weird

648
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,820
tricks and hacks and things that a I've

649
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:09,990
kind of learned doing some of this

650
00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:13,230
development um so let me go up here I

651
00:29:13,230 --> 00:29:18,840
don't need you anymore all right so I'm

652
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:21,720
gonna go to the browser here I wish I

653
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:25,529
can bump the size of this one up I don't

654
00:29:25,529 --> 00:29:31,620
think there is a way alright so it's

655
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:34,019
going to browser so i want to show you a

656
00:29:34,019 --> 00:29:36,120
couple of sites first off before i show

657
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:37,500
you kind of like the new what we're

658
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:40,259
working on zappos but flickr is a very

659
00:29:40,259 --> 00:29:41,399
interesting one where i think they did

660
00:29:41,399 --> 00:29:43,200
that they captured this this notion of

661
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:47,610
the web really well it still uses some

662
00:29:47,610 --> 00:29:49,950
some fancier tricks such as like the

663
00:29:49,950 --> 00:29:54,509
hash bang or hash minus the bang but it

664
00:29:54,509 --> 00:29:56,700
still kind of captures what the web is

665
00:29:56,700 --> 00:30:00,029
about and it allows the user to interact

666
00:30:00,029 --> 00:30:02,490
like it is a website so I'm just going

667
00:30:02,490 --> 00:30:06,019
to go to me so if you haven't used this

668
00:30:06,019 --> 00:30:09,929
it's it's really really nice so I'll go

669
00:30:09,929 --> 00:30:14,549
to this picture here so if you can find

670
00:30:14,549 --> 00:30:16,320
that guy and give them a bear hug like

671
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,899
that you can win a zappos fun bag that's

672
00:30:18,899 --> 00:30:20,879
what I heard so this is ian c myers he

673
00:30:20,879 --> 00:30:22,860
was leaving we opened up a dev dev

674
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:27,029
office and SF and so that was John bunch

675
00:30:27,029 --> 00:30:28,590
the tallest guy is a pose giving in a

676
00:30:28,590 --> 00:30:32,399
hug so yeah I mean this is it's it's

677
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:35,129
super simple it kind of interacts like

678
00:30:35,129 --> 00:30:36,720
you would think it would it's it doesn't

679
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:40,320
it doesn't do a lot of crazy things now

680
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:41,639
I do have a lot of problems with this

681
00:30:41,639 --> 00:30:43,710
one as well especially when it comes to

682
00:30:43,710 --> 00:30:44,909
the back button they kind of break that

683
00:30:44,909 --> 00:30:48,750
model whereas like if I go here I scroll

684
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:52,820
down I click on this guy or here and

685
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:57,919
then I'll hit back and I'm at the top

686
00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:00,360
it's I guess it's not as bad for them

687
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:02,730
because there's not that many but it's

688
00:31:02,730 --> 00:31:04,440
it's still not right it flush

689
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:06,510
rates people it's just not what they're

690
00:31:06,510 --> 00:31:10,380
used to another example is a facebook

691
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:12,510
they do some cool touch stuff they also

692
00:31:12,510 --> 00:31:17,700
do a lot of newer stuff and so they you

693
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:20,100
know it's it's it's simple it's you know

694
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:21,390
it's not they're not trying to emulate

695
00:31:21,390 --> 00:31:24,360
everything in native app is um they just

696
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:26,970
kind of you know I have a drop down here

697
00:31:26,970 --> 00:31:29,700
it's it's pretty simple stuff i like it

698
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:33,000
i don't actually use facebook but not

699
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,010
much so now i want to show you kind of

700
00:31:35,010 --> 00:31:37,230
what we've been working on and it's

701
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:38,610
going to be kind of slope is running on

702
00:31:38,610 --> 00:31:42,360
a dev builds going through a VPN and to

703
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:46,770
like layers of complexity so this is the

704
00:31:46,770 --> 00:31:48,360
this is what we're working on if you've

705
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:50,430
seen the current mobile website and i

706
00:31:50,430 --> 00:31:51,480
hope you and think that was what this

707
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:53,790
talk is about was that thing is i kind

708
00:31:53,790 --> 00:31:56,730
of hacked it together real quick so this

709
00:31:56,730 --> 00:32:00,380
is the the new mobile website here and

710
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:02,400
so I'm just going to do I'm sure to

711
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:05,580
search here so you'll notice that we

712
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:09,330
kind of keep the the idea behind of of

713
00:32:09,330 --> 00:32:12,270
Zappos and kind of just pulled it over

714
00:32:12,270 --> 00:32:13,470
we did some really good to have an

715
00:32:13,470 --> 00:32:15,030
awesome designer we're can I think

716
00:32:15,030 --> 00:32:16,230
that's a huge thing is we should have

717
00:32:16,230 --> 00:32:19,980
good designers helping us so we have you

718
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:22,740
know the search results here and these

719
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:25,050
buttons up here which actually pull up a

720
00:32:25,050 --> 00:32:26,550
select box so they're actually just

721
00:32:26,550 --> 00:32:28,680
select boxes kind of massed in this

722
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:30,000
button form and it works absolutely

723
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,560
beautifully because they get like this

724
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,480
kind of what they're used to and we

725
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,310
don't have to implement that because

726
00:32:38,310 --> 00:32:39,660
that would be a lot of work and it would

727
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:42,750
make it a lot of code and we're you know

728
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:47,550
lazy developers are how it should be so

729
00:32:47,550 --> 00:32:49,770
you know filtering this is installed yet

730
00:32:49,770 --> 00:32:53,820
I apologize and then stop paginate

731
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:57,200
encoder page for here and go to product

732
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:59,970
so you can see it's it's very very

733
00:32:59,970 --> 00:33:02,220
simple like a like a like a website it

734
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:06,750
doesn't feel like a mobile app but we do

735
00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:09,420
things where that where the browsers

736
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:11,130
allow us we do things that are

737
00:33:11,130 --> 00:33:13,410
interesting such as the swiping you know

738
00:33:13,410 --> 00:33:15,480
we you can swipe through product images

739
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:16,560
like you expect and people actually

740
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:17,750
expect

741
00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:20,570
at like if you give them this site and

742
00:33:20,570 --> 00:33:22,760
we've done some user testing and if you

743
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:25,010
give them this this page like this

744
00:33:25,010 --> 00:33:26,780
they'll flip through it automatically

745
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:29,920
it's not a strange concept to them and

746
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:33,650
so and another thing is pinching and

747
00:33:33,650 --> 00:33:35,300
zooming so we wanted to we have large

748
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:36,650
images on Zappos and we wanted to really

749
00:33:36,650 --> 00:33:38,870
bring pinching and zooming to the device

750
00:33:38,870 --> 00:33:41,180
and we could have implemented this in

751
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:43,880
JavaScript with some crazy complexity

752
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:46,730
but you know it was actually the

753
00:33:46,730 --> 00:33:48,650
designers idea because he didn't think

754
00:33:48,650 --> 00:33:50,690
like we could implement it in JavaScript

755
00:33:50,690 --> 00:33:52,730
and we kind of bought a heads on that

756
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:55,160
for a second but he actually came up

757
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,780
with hey why don't we just go to the

758
00:33:56,780 --> 00:33:59,960
image so we just linked to the image

759
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:04,150
here and you know you get native zooming

760
00:34:04,150 --> 00:34:08,090
native scrolling and it it's actually

761
00:34:08,090 --> 00:34:12,139
brilliantly simple and you could do that

762
00:34:12,139 --> 00:34:13,429
in them and other ways to do by just

763
00:34:13,429 --> 00:34:14,720
like going to a web page that's not

764
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:17,419
constrained by the scrolling of the zoom

765
00:34:17,419 --> 00:34:19,280
if you wanted more features on that page

766
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:25,520
so yeah that's kind of I want to show

767
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:26,750
you one more thing that I thought was

768
00:34:26,750 --> 00:34:28,790
pretty pretty sweet so I'm going to show

769
00:34:28,790 --> 00:34:29,810
you a little bit of code here let me

770
00:34:29,810 --> 00:34:32,629
bump this up and change the running out

771
00:34:32,629 --> 00:34:42,980
of time but let me go to good what's the

772
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:44,870
best one for that ah that's not too bad

773
00:34:44,870 --> 00:34:48,419
that's popped up

774
00:34:48,429 --> 00:34:53,300
alright this block right here if you

775
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:54,950
don't know if you've seen these app

776
00:34:54,950 --> 00:34:56,750
media queries and CSS but they're

777
00:34:56,750 --> 00:35:00,440
actually really cool so you could you

778
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:02,240
can actually specify like hey this is

779
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:05,240
going to be only for specific devices or

780
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:07,910
not even specific devices but specific

781
00:35:07,910 --> 00:35:09,950
qualities of a device so in this case

782
00:35:09,950 --> 00:35:13,310
the max with the min with has to be 480

783
00:35:13,310 --> 00:35:17,930
pixels so as to be 480 pixels before

784
00:35:17,930 --> 00:35:19,010
it's going to run that block and the

785
00:35:19,010 --> 00:35:20,780
cool part is if the page changes so that

786
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:22,670
it is 400 pixels at some foreign JT

787
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:23,930
pictures at some point it will then

788
00:35:23,930 --> 00:35:26,290
apply that part of the style sheet and

789
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:29,390
480 pixels is the rotation of an iPhone

790
00:35:29,390 --> 00:35:32,750
and in most androids are at least that

791
00:35:32,750 --> 00:35:35,089
but the whole idea here is so we had

792
00:35:35,089 --> 00:35:37,940
this on the cart we have this this area

793
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:39,290
we have three bonds on the bottom in the

794
00:35:39,290 --> 00:35:42,170
the subtotal of that item but when you

795
00:35:42,170 --> 00:35:45,800
rotated it we wanted to kind of lay out

796
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:48,140
slightly different it's it looks very

797
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:50,930
similar but it's different because of

798
00:35:50,930 --> 00:35:53,180
how it has to be laid out and though

799
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:55,790
it's it's hard to explain because it you

800
00:35:55,790 --> 00:35:57,470
usually it really makes it a lot more

801
00:35:57,470 --> 00:36:01,280
sense on an Android device so it's the

802
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,930
way that the buttons were spaced before

803
00:36:02,930 --> 00:36:05,480
are different and it's just so that we

804
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:07,220
can get this like grid line in the

805
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:11,000
middle so yeah so this this this block

806
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,920
runs only when it's that size I think

807
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:16,130
that's really cool some other neat

808
00:36:16,130 --> 00:36:18,349
things if you ever working on the on

809
00:36:18,349 --> 00:36:22,339
mobile web stuff there's these like some

810
00:36:22,339 --> 00:36:24,770
of these like CSS properties such as

811
00:36:24,770 --> 00:36:27,890
WebKit appearance we probably probably

812
00:36:27,890 --> 00:36:30,050
haven't seen it or maybe you have I kind

813
00:36:30,050 --> 00:36:31,460
of stumbled upon it by accident it was

814
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:32,780
one of the greatest things that happened

815
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:35,390
to me basically what it does is any kind

816
00:36:35,390 --> 00:36:37,520
of Native feel of a UI element sew a

817
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:39,230
button a select box it basically just

818
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:41,060
removes it all and makes it like this

819
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:43,670
white boring button but it's awesome

820
00:36:43,670 --> 00:36:46,040
because then you can just style it up as

821
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:48,980
however you want so we on all selection

822
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:51,230
all buttons we just kill all the native

823
00:36:51,230 --> 00:36:53,630
styling and then later down below we had

824
00:36:53,630 --> 00:36:56,390
gradients and other background images to

825
00:36:56,390 --> 00:36:58,369
them to kind of give them the effect of

826
00:36:58,369 --> 00:37:01,760
an actual button they

827
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:04,390
other thing is WebKit text size adjust

828
00:37:04,390 --> 00:37:08,240
it's a mouthful but so when you rotate

829
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:11,240
an iPhone or an Android the browser

830
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:14,180
automatically kind of images the size of

831
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:17,660
the text to kind of scale it to fit the

832
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:19,880
page more but when you're making a very

833
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:21,470
specific app where you know the sizes

834
00:37:21,470 --> 00:37:25,340
and your kind of relying on that the you

835
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:26,540
don't want that effect or things will

836
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:29,420
break at weird points and yeah so that

837
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:32,420
turns that just turns it off also

838
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:35,840
fantastic there's one more in here that

839
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:40,370
I wanted to which one was it it was so

840
00:37:40,370 --> 00:37:45,110
I'm grabbing notes here it was 0 users

841
00:37:45,110 --> 00:37:46,880
WebKit users select I don't know where I

842
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:55,730
use that whip Kate oops user up there's

843
00:37:55,730 --> 00:37:59,090
I'm so users select this is so that like

844
00:37:59,090 --> 00:38:00,440
you know that copy and paste dialog that

845
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:02,330
pops up when you're clicking around you

846
00:38:02,330 --> 00:38:05,030
can actually disable that with CSS I

847
00:38:05,030 --> 00:38:07,190
wouldn't I wouldn't that Apple gives a

848
00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:08,840
big warning on that page of don't do

849
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:11,180
this on like the body because I would

850
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:12,530
make people angry if I did want to copy

851
00:38:12,530 --> 00:38:13,880
and paste something but for specific

852
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:15,050
elements it's actually really cool so

853
00:38:15,050 --> 00:38:17,540
like you know a button sometimes you

854
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:18,920
press and you're thinking about you want

855
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:20,120
to hold it for a second and a copy and

856
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:22,480
paste dialog pops up it's it's strange

857
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:25,550
so that's also a really cool one and

858
00:38:25,550 --> 00:38:30,860
lastly box sizing which puts the you can

859
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:33,860
make it so like ghosts like I e6

860
00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:35,240
rendering mode for an element which

861
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:37,510
sounds crazy but it'll actually put the

862
00:38:37,510 --> 00:38:40,190
border and the padding inside the

863
00:38:40,190 --> 00:38:43,220
element when it's laid out and it allows

864
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:44,780
you to do like fifty percent with with a

865
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:48,140
border which is awesome you could do

866
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:53,360
that with the flexbox tough but it's not

867
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:58,550
supported fully in everything yet so yes

868
00:38:58,550 --> 00:39:01,310
so that's a that's pretty much all i had

869
00:39:01,310 --> 00:39:04,310
there so i don't know if i have time for

870
00:39:04,310 --> 00:39:08,600
questions oh yeah we're hiring it's my i

871
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:10,880
have to say that I think we're hiring

872
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,350
for a lot of stuff so pretty much if

873
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:14,690
you're into anything from front-end

874
00:39:14,690 --> 00:39:15,650
development back

875
00:39:15,650 --> 00:39:18,350
development mobile stuff cysts

876
00:39:18,350 --> 00:39:23,270
engineering call center whatever yeah so

877
00:39:23,270 --> 00:39:24,710
if i have time for questions I'd like to

878
00:39:24,710 --> 00:39:28,460
kind of field a couple questions so the

879
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:29,330
quite the question I'll repeat it

880
00:39:29,330 --> 00:39:31,400
Christian here is like for media queries

881
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:32,630
there's a lot of discussion on that and

882
00:39:32,630 --> 00:39:35,710
should we use some of the mobile stuff

883
00:39:35,710 --> 00:39:39,530
it works out but should be using it on

884
00:39:39,530 --> 00:39:42,020
our main site to make the main site so

885
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:43,190
if you go to this site it will just use

886
00:39:43,190 --> 00:39:44,720
media queries to make it a mobile site

887
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:46,690
and I think that really depends on your

888
00:39:46,690 --> 00:39:49,910
what you're going for the the zappos

889
00:39:49,910 --> 00:39:52,730
mobile website is very different than

890
00:39:52,730 --> 00:39:54,710
the website so it wouldn't have worked

891
00:39:54,710 --> 00:39:56,300
out the some of the information is

892
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:57,380
different we don't put ever we don't

893
00:39:57,380 --> 00:39:58,910
push everything down some of the

894
00:39:58,910 --> 00:40:01,010
features that aren't really required for

895
00:40:01,010 --> 00:40:03,500
the mobile experience so when it worked

896
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:05,510
out for us but if you have certain

897
00:40:05,510 --> 00:40:07,550
things I think like a good example would

898
00:40:07,550 --> 00:40:10,040
be like any kind of content side like a

899
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:11,510
blog or anything to that I think it's a

900
00:40:11,510 --> 00:40:14,870
perfect idea I don't you actually don't

901
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:16,370
know all the debating the debates on

902
00:40:16,370 --> 00:40:20,740
that and so it works it's cool I guess

903
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:26,240
that's all I care about so yeah in so

904
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:28,340
the quote the comment was on why limit

905
00:40:28,340 --> 00:40:31,340
this discussion of app versus or the app

906
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:33,650
the native app feel to mobile why not

907
00:40:33,650 --> 00:40:35,060
also desktop browser and I think that's

908
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:38,360
an excellent an excellent point I went

909
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:40,880
in I think that's a great argument to be

910
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:42,470
made on the desktop platform as well I

911
00:40:42,470 --> 00:40:43,820
think it's been something we've been

912
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:49,250
struggling with for a while I I just

913
00:40:49,250 --> 00:40:51,350
don't have the qualifications I guess to

914
00:40:51,350 --> 00:40:53,600
argue that so I'm going to argue what

915
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:55,640
I've been working on and but yeah I

916
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:57,200
think that's an awesome point and I

917
00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:05,660
fully support that anyone else

918
00:41:05,670 --> 00:41:12,310
alright well thank you roads take me

919
00:41:12,310 --> 00:41:18,100
