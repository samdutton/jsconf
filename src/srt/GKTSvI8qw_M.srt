00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:24,960

reject hi um hi I'm miles thank you all

2
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,300
for taking the time today I was thinking

3
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:29,279
you know can we just give a quick round

4
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:31,230
of applause to everyone from reject

5
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:32,460
who's put on this really amazing

6
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:40,860
conference today

7
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:43,250
like well they didn't start the timer so

8
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:45,590
that didn't work as well as I hoped but

9
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:47,420
so I'm currently pretty fun employed and

10
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:49,250
between gigs it worked out really

11
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:51,230
greatly it happened right before burning

12
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:54,620
man so I had a lot of time to enjoy and

13
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:57,650
plan but don't worry I've got something

14
00:00:57,650 --> 00:00:59,300
really exciting plan but I can't tell

15
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:02,690
you about it yet but so you know the

16
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:04,339
reason I mentioned what I do is a great

17
00:01:04,339 --> 00:01:06,470
way to start a lot of talks is to look

18
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:07,970
at the audience and let them know hey

19
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:10,580
this is why I'm qualified to tell you

20
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:13,399
what I'm about to tell you so you know

21
00:01:13,399 --> 00:01:14,930
empathy is a really interesting topic

22
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:17,420
and there is you know there's some

23
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:18,860
interesting reasons why I'm qualified to

24
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:21,020
talk to you about it so I have an

25
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:23,090
undergraduate degree in fine art I

26
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:25,360
studied some Marxism I studied some

27
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,530
digital technology culture some

28
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:29,570
posthumanism you know none of that

29
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:31,280
really matters to talk about empathy

30
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,759
though I have a master's degree in music

31
00:01:34,759 --> 00:01:36,380
you know music is all about connecting

32
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:38,360
with people and all that but like you

33
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:39,979
know that doesn't really matter either

34
00:01:39,979 --> 00:01:42,200
it turns out I'm qualified to talk to

35
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,959
about empathy because I'm a human being

36
00:01:43,959 --> 00:01:46,550
and we'll get back to why that matters

37
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:50,690
later but right now you know I'm going

38
00:01:50,690 --> 00:01:51,709
to give you a quick breakdown on what

39
00:01:51,709 --> 00:01:53,479
we're going to talk about we're going to

40
00:01:53,479 --> 00:01:55,550
give a quick definition of what empathy

41
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:57,619
is we're going to follow that up with

42
00:01:57,619 --> 00:01:59,209
describing what's the difference between

43
00:01:59,209 --> 00:02:01,880
empathy and sympathy those are two

44
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,140
things that are very very similar

45
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:05,330
they're often confused but they're also

46
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:07,970
very different and you know sympathy can

47
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:09,950
actually be pretty toxic believe it or

48
00:02:09,950 --> 00:02:11,660
not we're going to talk about the

49
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:13,819
history of the term empathy where does

50
00:02:13,819 --> 00:02:16,370
it come from how did it evolve it's not

51
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:17,450
as old as you think it's a little

52
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:19,129
spoiler we're going to talk about the

53
00:02:19,129 --> 00:02:20,900
neuroscience of empathy how we're wired

54
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:22,220
for empathy why does this actually

55
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:24,260
happen we're going to follow that up

56
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:26,090
with about the concept of learning

57
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:28,970
empathy it turns out you know even

58
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:30,410
though we're naturally wired to be

59
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:32,900
empathetic it's not supernatural to

60
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:35,209
follow through on that then we're going

61
00:02:35,209 --> 00:02:36,739
to talk about empathy as a developer

62
00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:38,360
really short we're not going to really

63
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,760
focus on that too much but we'll start

64
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,920
with this definition there's a fantastic

65
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:45,290
paper by Teresa Wiseman defining the

66
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:48,380
attributes of empathy she's a nurse this

67
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:50,450
paper is specifically focused on nursing

68
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:51,740
but she studied many professions and I

69
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:53,330
think you know it's a pretty global

70
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:53,650
thing

71
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:55,329
so the first thing about being

72
00:02:55,329 --> 00:02:56,739
empathetic is understanding the

73
00:02:56,739 --> 00:02:58,569
perspective of the person in which

74
00:02:58,569 --> 00:03:01,750
you're being empathetic to it's

75
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:03,519
important to stay out of judgment it's

76
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:05,860
really easy to judge an individual you

77
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:06,819
can't do that if you're going to

78
00:03:06,819 --> 00:03:10,150
empathize you need to recognize what

79
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:11,920
they're feeling you need to figure out

80
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,510
that feeling you need to separate it and

81
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:15,670
you need to really understand it and you

82
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:17,769
need to follow up by communicating back

83
00:03:17,769 --> 00:03:20,730
to the individual what that feeling is

84
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:27,010
empathy is feeling with people so

85
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:28,659
Theresa Wiseman have this great quote in

86
00:03:28,659 --> 00:03:30,670
our paper it is the ability to empathize

87
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:33,400
which distinguishes an average nurse

88
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,470
from an excellent nurse and the eyes of

89
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:38,260
the patient so I'm going to go and just

90
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:41,290
you know step out and say hey perhaps it

91
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:43,689
is the ability to empathize that

92
00:03:43,689 --> 00:03:46,180
distinguishes an average developer from

93
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:47,980
an excellent developer in the eyes of

94
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:50,739
others and then you know maybe even take

95
00:03:50,739 --> 00:03:52,629
it stretch further and it's the ability

96
00:03:52,629 --> 00:03:54,489
to empathize which distinguishes an

97
00:03:54,489 --> 00:03:56,920
average human being from an excellent

98
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:59,319
human being I don't know I kind of like

99
00:03:59,319 --> 00:04:02,319
that so let that sit in we'll take a

100
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:06,329
trip a trip ekt break think about that I

101
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:11,709
were good cool so empathy versus

102
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:13,810
sympathy I'm going to cheat I'm gonna

103
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:16,000
play a video it's an amazing video I

104
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,889
can't actually say it better than this

105
00:04:17,889 --> 00:04:19,510
video does so we're going to watch it

106
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:21,340
it's a video by brenÃ© Brown it's from

107
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:23,560
RSA the Royal Society of the Arts and

108
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,820
I'm just going to I'm not going to

109
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:34,870
introduce it any more than that so what

110
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:38,139
is empathy and why is it very different

111
00:04:38,139 --> 00:04:41,729
than sympathy empathy fuels connection

112
00:04:41,729 --> 00:04:45,639
sympathy drives disconnection empathy

113
00:04:45,639 --> 00:04:47,770
it's a very interesting Teresa Wiseman

114
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:50,669
is a nursing scholar who studied

115
00:04:50,669 --> 00:04:53,260
professions very diverse professions

116
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:54,760
where empathy is relevant and came up

117
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,159
with four qualities of empathy

118
00:04:56,159 --> 00:04:59,260
perspective taking the ability to take

119
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:00,760
the perspective of another person or

120
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,500
recognize their perspective as their

121
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:05,110
truth staying out of judgment not easy

122
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:06,729
when you enjoy it as much as most of us

123
00:05:06,729 --> 00:05:08,800
do

124
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,940
recognizing emotion and other people and

125
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:13,690
then communicating that empathy is

126
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:17,450
feeling with people and to me I always

127
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:19,580
think of empathy is this kind of sacred

128
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:22,700
space when someone's kind of in a deep

129
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:24,800
hole and they shout out from the bottom

130
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,680
and they say I'm stuck it's dark I'm

131
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,740
overwhelmed and then we look and we say

132
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:34,310
hey on down I know what it's like down

133
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:37,640
here and you're not alone sympathy is

134
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:46,040
ooh it's bad uh-huh uh no you want

135
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:50,960
sandwich if he is a choice and it's a

136
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,640
vulnerable choice because in order to

137
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:55,220
connect with you I have to connect with

138
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:57,560
something in myself that knows that

139
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:01,040
feeling rarely if ever does an empathic

140
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:06,440
response begin with at least I had a

141
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:09,440
yeah and we do it all the time because

142
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,000
you know what someone just shared

143
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,680
something with us that's incredibly

144
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:15,050
painful and we're trying to silver

145
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:16,760
lining it I don't think that's a verb

146
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:19,880
but I'm using it as one we're trying to

147
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,590
put this a little running around it so I

148
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:24,860
had a miscarriage at least you know you

149
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:26,810
can get pregnant I think my marriage is

150
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:29,270
falling apart at least you have a

151
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:33,580
marriage

152
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:36,050
John's getting kicked out of school at

153
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:38,660
least Sarah is an A student but one of

154
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:40,820
the things we do sometimes in the face

155
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:45,410
of very difficult conversations is we

156
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:47,900
try to make things better if I share

157
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:49,370
something with you that's very difficult

158
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:52,610
I'd whether you say I don't even know

159
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:53,810
what to say right now I'm just so glad

160
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:57,770
you told me because the truth is rarely

161
00:06:57,770 --> 00:07:00,230
can a response make something better

162
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:02,270
what makes something better is

163
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:10,040
connection so you're going to notice

164
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:12,950
that there's a handful of things that I

165
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:14,360
kind of lifted right out of that I'm

166
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,400
sampling all through this talk that'll

167
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,780
make sure to kind of give reference so

168
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:18,860
you can see where I'm grabbing things

169
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:20,480
from one of the important things I'm

170
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,260
going to do here is I'm going to

171
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:23,150
constantly repeat things that I think

172
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:24,800
are really important for you to absorb

173
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,960
and that's if any of you ever do any

174
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,220
public speaking that's a really great

175
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:30,380
technique it's just repeat yourself over

176
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:31,730
and over because like I have the

177
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:33,800
attention span of like a fly so by

178
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,570
repeating things you can make sure that

179
00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:37,040
like that important information gets out

180
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:40,430
there so as they said empathy is feeling

181
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:44,560
with you sympathy is feeling for you

182
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:47,180
empathy is about being present with

183
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:52,370
someone empathy is a choice rarely can a

184
00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:54,920
response make something better what

185
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:57,250
makes something better as a connection

186
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:59,360
another trip ekt break just think about

187
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:05,690
it I love this one it's like smoke so

188
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:06,890
let's get into the history this is going

189
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:08,840
to get really really dry I'm sorry but

190
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:12,770
it's kind of cool and a spoiler believe

191
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:14,660
it or not the term empathy is only about

192
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:18,650
a hundred years old so romantic thinkers

193
00:08:18,650 --> 00:08:20,180
in the 18th century such as herder in

194
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:22,430
Novalis question the contemporary notion

195
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:24,440
of aesthetics and aesthetics we're

196
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:26,180
talking about in kind of like art

197
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:28,010
history the aesthetics of art what makes

198
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:30,460
something beautiful what evokes emotion

199
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:33,350
the main problem was that of expression

200
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:35,630
if our nature are incapable of

201
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:38,540
expressing human feelings how then can

202
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:40,400
they if they're incapable of

203
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,320
experiencing human feelings how can they

204
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,650
express them how can i get like sad and

205
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:47,540
melodramatic looking at a pain

206
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:50,269
of a tree doesn't really make sense tree

207
00:08:50,269 --> 00:08:52,959
doesn't feel as far as i know it works

208
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:57,139
so in 1870 to a German philosopher

209
00:08:57,139 --> 00:08:59,389
Robert Fischer proposed an answer that

210
00:08:59,389 --> 00:09:01,579
the explanation must lie in some

211
00:09:01,579 --> 00:09:03,560
unconscious process of the person who

212
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:07,339
views these forms and I'm going to

213
00:09:07,339 --> 00:09:09,649
totally mess this up actually know what

214
00:09:09,649 --> 00:09:11,630
rather than me saying it on the count of

215
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:12,829
three two all the German audience

216
00:09:12,829 --> 00:09:14,959
members want to say this word for me

217
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:23,910
we're going to try it okay one two three

218
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:28,550
that was awesome and this directly

219
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:32,600
translates into feeling into so if you

220
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,370
looked at art you would feel into the

221
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:35,930
art you would see something beautiful

222
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:39,769
you would feel into it this idea was

223
00:09:39,769 --> 00:09:42,529
first elaborated by Vishal ER in his

224
00:09:42,529 --> 00:09:44,720
paper dose yeah I'm going to mess that

225
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:48,319
one up to opt each form mango fool it

226
00:09:48,319 --> 00:09:51,560
was I close no okay whatever aesthetic

227
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:53,870
pleasure may thus be explained as

228
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:55,790
objectified self enjoyment in which

229
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:59,000
subject and object are fused our ability

230
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,380
to feel into art this was further

231
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:05,660
explored by another German philosopher

232
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:07,880
Theodore lips in the aesthetic that

233
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:10,699
woman was easy he closely links our

234
00:10:10,699 --> 00:10:12,350
aesthetic perception and our perception

235
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:14,269
of another embodied person as a minded

236
00:10:14,269 --> 00:10:16,459
creature the nature of aesthetic empathy

237
00:10:16,459 --> 00:10:18,769
is always the experience of another

238
00:10:18,769 --> 00:10:23,899
human so in 1999 in 1909 the term

239
00:10:23,899 --> 00:10:26,180
empathy was introduced by psychologist

240
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:28,550
Edward itchin or as a Trent as

241
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:32,959
transliteration of the german term thank

242
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:34,740
you

243
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:42,790
so another trippy kitty break I love

244
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:50,540
that one one more time I'm a bumblebee

245
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:52,360
okay so let's talk about the

246
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:56,350
neuroscience of empathy many of the

247
00:10:56,350 --> 00:10:57,910
ideas i'm about to discuss came from

248
00:10:57,910 --> 00:10:59,350
this talk we're not good we're not going

249
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:00,610
to watch this one it's ten minutes long

250
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:02,830
that would be super cheating it was kind

251
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:03,850
of cheating before this would be really

252
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:06,490
cheating but the slides are online I'll

253
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:07,450
tweet a link to it you should definitely

254
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:10,450
watch this video it's really cool it

255
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:11,770
builds on the ideas that I'm about to

256
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:13,570
talk about I won't spoil it anymore just

257
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:16,930
watch it it's awesome but so healthy

258
00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:23,140
human brains are wired for empathy one

259
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:25,240
such phenomenon is what's known as

260
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:28,720
mirror neurons so basically the neurons

261
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,790
fires both when you're performing an

262
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:32,500
action and when you observe someone else

263
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,000
performing an action and and this is

264
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,040
like a little clip from that RSA Animate

265
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,270
video that's linked in the previous

266
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:40,390
slide so this was first discovered by

267
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:43,480
italian scientists in the 1990s giacomo

268
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,490
rizzolatti a neuroscientist at the

269
00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:46,960
university of paramount noticed this

270
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,370
strange phenomenon with a monkey and

271
00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:50,890
some peanuts so essentially they had

272
00:11:50,890 --> 00:11:52,690
this experiment setup and the monkey was

273
00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:56,620
set up to an MRI and they were watching

274
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:58,900
what happened to the monkeys brain as he

275
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:00,430
ate and so the monkey would you know

276
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:02,170
like open the pinna put in his mouth and

277
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:03,970
like all the stuff would be firing off

278
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:05,740
and they're like we're scientist this is

279
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:09,190
awesome and then something really

280
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:11,710
amazing happened one of the scientists

281
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:14,320
got really really hungry and decided

282
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,970
just eat a peanut in front of the monkey

283
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:17,860
well it was still connected to the MRI

284
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:22,180
and all of a sudden the monkeys neurons

285
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:24,610
that fired when he ate the peanut fired

286
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:26,290
when when the scientist ate the peanut

287
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:28,360
this is like people were like what is

288
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:30,420
wrong here like this machine is broken

289
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:32,530
but it turned out that there's this

290
00:12:32,530 --> 00:12:34,750
phenomenon called mirror neurons when

291
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:37,090
you witness someone doing something you

292
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:39,580
you can like sense it the neurons fire

293
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:41,890
off you know like if I fell off the

294
00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:43,270
stage right now and hit my head

295
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:45,490
everybody like a little and then I'd be

296
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:47,320
really embarrassing would suck but like

297
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,310
if you see someone

298
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:49,720
a spider you kind of get that crawly

299
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,970
feeling you know you see someone get get

300
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:54,130
hurt you feel it it were wired for this

301
00:12:54,130 --> 00:12:56,320
it's really it's pretty phenomenal and

302
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,720
this kind of challenges a lot of early

303
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:02,020
ideas about how humans are wired how

304
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:03,580
things work a lot of how our

305
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:05,680
civilization has been built on like

306
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,050
these notions of selfhood of oneness of

307
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:10,420
not being connected to people that's

308
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:11,710
what this the other talk that I

309
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:13,779
reference is all about i really suggest

310
00:13:13,779 --> 00:13:16,690
that you watch it but so Marco Jacoby

311
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:19,270
professor of psychiatry and I hate bio

312
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:21,520
behavioral sciences argue that neural

313
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:23,830
neurons are the neural basis of the

314
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:25,870
human capacity for emotions such as

315
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:29,950
empathy so you know again if we if we go

316
00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:30,880
back to what we were talking in the

317
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:33,250
history this concept has been around for

318
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:35,710
about you know like a hundred 150 years

319
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:37,900
and now all of a sudden you know like 20

320
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,970
years ago we're getting research that's

321
00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:42,130
showing hey you know like not only is

322
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:44,020
this like a phenomena that we can talk

323
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:45,820
about philosophically there's actually

324
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:47,860
like a scientific back background behind

325
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:51,190
this like we're wired to do this so like

326
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:52,480
some other examples that you can see is

327
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,670
when a baby cries in a nursery all the

328
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:56,080
other babies join in this is a

329
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:59,380
phenomenon called empathic distress so

330
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:01,450
you know we can watch the growth of

331
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:03,490
children and we can kind of see you know

332
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:04,930
around the age of two and a half a child

333
00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:06,850
starts actually being able to recognize

334
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:08,770
their self in a mirror this this sense

335
00:14:08,770 --> 00:14:10,900
of self pneus comes in and the sense of

336
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:13,180
selfhood goes hand in hand with an

337
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:15,310
empathic development now that they have

338
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:16,960
self they can look at others and start

339
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,850
like understanding you know if this

340
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:21,610
person hurts themselves I can kind of

341
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:24,940
feel it I can relate with that so the

342
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:26,740
next slide I'm going to apologize so

343
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:28,600
this first one is from the first season

344
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:29,950
of full house and I tried to find a

345
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:31,570
really good one Michelle tanner because

346
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:33,520
the next size about eight year olds but

347
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:34,510
I couldn't get an eight year-old

348
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:36,850
michelle tanner unfortunately but it's

349
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:38,440
around eight years of age a child starts

350
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,910
learning about birth and death they

351
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:42,430
learn about vulnerability and this

352
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:45,339
starts like really it starts with like

353
00:14:45,339 --> 00:14:46,959
an existential trip you start

354
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:48,640
understanding that you only have one

355
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:51,220
life that's slowly over time the things

356
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:52,690
that you do matter and then you start

357
00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:53,800
looking at other people and you think

358
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,930
wow those people only have one life and

359
00:14:55,930 --> 00:14:57,310
we're all kind of in this struggle

360
00:14:57,310 --> 00:14:59,410
together and and now you're it just

361
00:14:59,410 --> 00:15:01,000
grows that empathy you start thinking

362
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,339
hey

363
00:15:02,339 --> 00:15:05,260
that person they have their own life

364
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:09,910
it's their own thing it builds it once

365
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:11,589
you realize you only have one life you

366
00:15:11,589 --> 00:15:13,570
can now feel other struggles you know

367
00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:15,160
that they have their own lives you know

368
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:18,760
their struggles some philosophers such

369
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,980
as Schopenhauer believe that the

370
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:22,990
empathic emotions such as compassion are

371
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:25,089
possible because we're all part of a

372
00:15:25,089 --> 00:15:28,240
greater ontological whole it's pretty

373
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,860
cool concept we're all kind of part of

374
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:31,860
one thing this again kind of goes

375
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:34,390
against a lot of what our culture has

376
00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:36,040
been built upon and a lot of what our

377
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:39,970
value systems have been built upon it's

378
00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:42,399
important to remember though that while

379
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:44,410
our ability is to feel empathy may be

380
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:47,589
soft wired our ability to act on it is a

381
00:15:47,589 --> 00:15:50,080
learned trait I really want you to think

382
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:52,240
about that because not everyone is

383
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:55,209
naturally empathetic it can be really

384
00:15:55,209 --> 00:15:57,970
really hard to make yourself vulnerable

385
00:15:57,970 --> 00:16:01,120
to truly empathize with someone is not

386
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,940
easy and so you shouldn't feel ashamed

387
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:06,040
if you're not naturally just like the

388
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:08,200
most feely amazing person in the world

389
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,610
hugging everyone and feeling it

390
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:11,290
constantly this is something you have to

391
00:16:11,290 --> 00:16:13,240
work on you have to you have to like

392
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:17,650
build on these natural urges so we're

393
00:16:17,650 --> 00:16:19,330
going to now talk a little bit about

394
00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:22,839
learning empathy so this is a great

395
00:16:22,839 --> 00:16:25,810
quote from a paper on education

396
00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:27,940
expressing care for another person is

397
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:30,610
not an innate ability present more

398
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:32,920
naturally in some people than others but

399
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,510
rather a skill that can be taught and

400
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:36,190
nurtured through a supportive

401
00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:39,160
educational environment it's really

402
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:41,260
interesting as you go through some of

403
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:42,810
the literature they start talking about

404
00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:45,130
the importance of empathy as a teacher

405
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:47,920
and specifically kind of the idea that

406
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:50,200
when you're teaching you shouldn't be

407
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:52,779
teaching the content you should be

408
00:16:52,779 --> 00:16:55,420
teaching the feeling like at the end the

409
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:56,920
knowledge itself is not really as

410
00:16:56,920 --> 00:17:00,149
important as creating whole human beings

411
00:17:00,149 --> 00:17:04,120
so it turns out that for myself empathy

412
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:07,360
was something I had to learn so let's go

413
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,980
down a little bit of an anecdote and

414
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:12,910
let's get real for the second here this

415
00:17:12,910 --> 00:17:14,679
is a young me would have been even

416
00:17:14,679 --> 00:17:15,680
younger a little kid

417
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:19,610
who is my younger brother um I was a bit

418
00:17:19,610 --> 00:17:22,670
of a shithead like not totally I wasn't

419
00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:25,490
the worst but I was very self-involved I

420
00:17:25,490 --> 00:17:28,730
suffer from pretty crazy ADHD I didn't

421
00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:31,670
really understand like when they talked

422
00:17:31,670 --> 00:17:33,440
about at like eight years ago you start

423
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,790
like recognizing other people and

424
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:36,410
understanding them like that didn't

425
00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:38,750
actually come naturally to me I didn't

426
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:40,160
really understand it i was super

427
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,480
self-involved and I was super

428
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:44,720
self-involved for quite a while so like

429
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,310
you know like I wasn't exactly a problem

430
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:49,610
child but I was never very observant I

431
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:51,560
went through a good chunk of my life

432
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:53,900
without having very meaningful

433
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:55,910
relationships and this is even within my

434
00:17:55,910 --> 00:17:57,410
own family it was just you know

435
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:59,620
unfortunate but it's just what happened

436
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:05,030
then I met Christina so she's very

437
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:07,490
different than I am she patiently taught

438
00:18:07,490 --> 00:18:09,830
me how to be observant and how to feel

439
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:13,790
for others so sharing my life with

440
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:17,630
someone made me a better person and has

441
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:21,110
made me a more empathetic person it's

442
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:23,660
important to remember well our ability

443
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:26,140
to feel empathy may be soft wired our

444
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:30,260
ability to learn it our ability to act

445
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:35,260
on it is a learned trait ask yourself

446
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:41,120
Who am I who is the other and I'm going

447
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,500
to ask you all if you have time to go

448
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,840
and look up the term other there's a lot

449
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:47,360
of really amazing philosophy about this

450
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,740
concept of the other and it's something

451
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:50,390
that's like hardwired into our culture

452
00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:53,030
and super freaking toxic but who is this

453
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:57,170
other how are they other why are they

454
00:18:57,170 --> 00:19:03,940
other how do we relate what do we share

455
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:07,520
what do they need from me and I from

456
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:11,930
them so a trippy katie break I was

457
00:19:11,930 --> 00:19:16,899
really heavy

458
00:19:16,909 --> 00:19:21,619
so empathy as a developer so there's

459
00:19:21,619 --> 00:19:23,830
three places that we can focus on this

460
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:26,149
having empathy for the people you make

461
00:19:26,149 --> 00:19:30,619
things for having empathy for those you

462
00:19:30,619 --> 00:19:34,309
make things with and having empathy for

463
00:19:34,309 --> 00:19:37,220
yourself which truthfully is kind of the

464
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:38,450
place you need to start because if you

465
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:39,710
don't have empathy for yourself you

466
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:42,830
can't empathize for anyone else so

467
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:44,869
having empathy for the people you make

468
00:19:44,869 --> 00:19:46,460
things for how are ways that we can do

469
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:48,979
that accessibility is a really easy one

470
00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:50,659
we've seen some really great talks today

471
00:19:50,659 --> 00:19:52,639
about accessibility know who's using

472
00:19:52,639 --> 00:19:54,799
your software know who's using your

473
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:57,769
site's care about all of them no one

474
00:19:57,769 --> 00:19:59,509
user is less important than the other

475
00:19:59,509 --> 00:20:02,269
there's a really really great concept

476
00:20:02,269 --> 00:20:05,389
called the poor child the the idea is if

477
00:20:05,389 --> 00:20:07,700
you maintain multiple code bases one of

478
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:09,109
them is just not going to be cared for

479
00:20:09,109 --> 00:20:10,759
as much as the other make sure there's

480
00:20:10,759 --> 00:20:12,409
no poor children make sure you care

481
00:20:12,409 --> 00:20:13,909
about everyone that you're making

482
00:20:13,909 --> 00:20:16,729
software for performance and bandwidth

483
00:20:16,729 --> 00:20:19,099
not everyone that you're making software

484
00:20:19,099 --> 00:20:22,129
for is on a brand new MacBook Pro and

485
00:20:22,129 --> 00:20:24,739
living in a city with cheap data plans

486
00:20:24,739 --> 00:20:26,720
think about the people around the world

487
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,249
who are going to be using your software

488
00:20:28,249 --> 00:20:30,820
think about how to make it easy for them

489
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:33,649
empathize for them you there's tools

490
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:34,999
that are available like I think it's

491
00:20:34,999 --> 00:20:37,399
called comcast fi it's really amazing it

492
00:20:37,399 --> 00:20:39,409
will like slow down your internet

493
00:20:39,409 --> 00:20:41,659
connection to a halt so that you can

494
00:20:41,659 --> 00:20:43,609
like experience like how bad it is to be

495
00:20:43,609 --> 00:20:47,119
on Comcast but no but like put these

496
00:20:47,119 --> 00:20:48,739
tools into your workflow see what it's

497
00:20:48,739 --> 00:20:50,869
like go on to sites that can go and give

498
00:20:50,869 --> 00:20:52,369
you an idea of how much it costs to just

499
00:20:52,369 --> 00:20:55,039
load your web page on a random site and

500
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:56,779
I say this as like I have this like I

501
00:20:56,779 --> 00:20:58,340
think there's like 100 megabytes just to

502
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:00,799
load my slide presentation so you know

503
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:02,179
like I understand that you can't always

504
00:21:02,179 --> 00:21:05,090
do it but think about it platform

505
00:21:05,090 --> 00:21:07,159
support you know not everyone is going

506
00:21:07,159 --> 00:21:10,009
to be on OS X not everyone is going to

507
00:21:10,009 --> 00:21:13,070
be on Windows you know like a really

508
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:15,259
funny anecdote I recently was talking to

509
00:21:15,259 --> 00:21:17,690
a friend of mine who I won't name the

510
00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:18,619
company cuz I don't wanna get them in

511
00:21:18,619 --> 00:21:20,779
trouble but so what's really really cool

512
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:22,940
is everyone thinks you know Internet

513
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:24,499
Explorer is the worst and you know I

514
00:21:24,499 --> 00:21:27,200
don't want to support IE 8 turns out you

515
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,580
know what's going to really make our

516
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:30,350
lives really difficult

517
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:35,049
safari because because it turns out that

518
00:21:35,049 --> 00:21:37,100
windows at least gives people the option

519
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:39,230
of updating their browser if you have an

520
00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:40,760
old macbook like you know your

521
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:42,289
grandmother you gave her your macbook

522
00:21:42,289 --> 00:21:44,600
because you're such a nice grandkid or

523
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:46,580
you gave it to your grandfather or your

524
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:49,220
cousin an old macbook actually can't

525
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:53,630
upgrade to the new OS X which means you

526
00:21:53,630 --> 00:21:55,490
can't upgrade to the new safari so you

527
00:21:55,490 --> 00:21:57,470
end up with all these old safaris that

528
00:21:57,470 --> 00:21:59,960
have all these really weird bugs think

529
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,760
about that be aware of that when you

530
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,860
make like a really flashy splash page

531
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:06,590
for your like healthcare startup maybe

532
00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:12,380
that's a bad idea build your user not

533
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:15,049
for yourself this is a huge thing I see

534
00:22:15,049 --> 00:22:16,970
people doing all the time you know you

535
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:18,169
feature creep yourself with all the

536
00:22:18,169 --> 00:22:19,549
amazing things you think your site could

537
00:22:19,549 --> 00:22:22,220
do maybe your users just don't care

538
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:24,710
which brings us to the final one listen

539
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:26,960
to them talk to them like actually go

540
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:31,039
meet them care about them having empathy

541
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:34,090
for those you make things with

542
00:22:34,090 --> 00:22:35,980
documentation is just like a no-brainer

543
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:38,929
I'm not even gonna bother talking but

544
00:22:38,929 --> 00:22:40,419
you all know what I'm going to say

545
00:22:40,419 --> 00:22:43,789
testing same thing just do it like let's

546
00:22:43,789 --> 00:22:46,159
do it onboarding this is a really

547
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:48,230
interesting one so I helped organize a

548
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:49,820
conference called jQuery SF and there

549
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:52,309
was a really amazing talk by John rezac

550
00:22:52,309 --> 00:22:54,020
who's the creator of jQuery and he

551
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:57,620
talked about empathy for for his you

552
00:22:57,620 --> 00:22:59,030
know end users who were developers

553
00:22:59,030 --> 00:23:00,950
working with the jQuery platform so it's

554
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:02,270
interesting too if you make developer

555
00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:04,130
tools empathizing for those who make

556
00:23:04,130 --> 00:23:06,320
things with is empathizing for those you

557
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:07,760
make things for it's the same person

558
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,530
it's also kind of empathizing for

559
00:23:09,530 --> 00:23:11,780
yourself to 10 turns out they're all the

560
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:14,960
same but so he talks about onboarding

561
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:17,179
people on the first day and the first

562
00:23:17,179 --> 00:23:19,580
week and the first month someone should

563
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:21,590
be able to sit down and get running

564
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:23,900
within 20 minutes without really hitting

565
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:25,909
any roadblocks then in the first week

566
00:23:25,909 --> 00:23:27,230
they should be able to get running and

567
00:23:27,230 --> 00:23:29,150
not really have problems to have the

568
00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:30,919
documentation they need to do a basic

569
00:23:30,919 --> 00:23:32,840
something and then a month like they

570
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:34,730
should have the support that's necessary

571
00:23:34,730 --> 00:23:37,159
to just get things done that was one of

572
00:23:37,159 --> 00:23:38,780
the first things jquery did that's why

573
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:41,419
it was so successful ray-ban go is the

574
00:23:41,419 --> 00:23:42,799
first developer working on the jquery

575
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:44,029
project and he literally would go

576
00:23:44,029 --> 00:23:45,559
around the entire internet and find

577
00:23:45,559 --> 00:23:47,119
every single problem that anyone had

578
00:23:47,119 --> 00:23:49,759
with jquery hunt them down and fix it or

579
00:23:49,759 --> 00:23:51,679
at least support them first class

580
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:53,809
support was really important so think

581
00:23:53,809 --> 00:23:54,739
about that when you're bringing new

582
00:23:54,739 --> 00:23:56,659
employees into your office how did it

583
00:23:56,659 --> 00:23:57,979
feel on your first day when you showed

584
00:23:57,979 --> 00:23:59,690
up and someone handed you like a massive

585
00:23:59,690 --> 00:24:01,340
rail stack was like install post grass

586
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:02,929
and you're like what's address you know

587
00:24:02,929 --> 00:24:07,909
why am i posted be a good Ally and boast

588
00:24:07,909 --> 00:24:09,830
in the sense of a 11 y and also in the

589
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:11,629
sense as a human being if you haven't

590
00:24:11,629 --> 00:24:13,129
heard this term go Google what it means

591
00:24:13,129 --> 00:24:14,899
to be an ally go Google what it means to

592
00:24:14,899 --> 00:24:16,879
be a bad a lie that's a great one look

593
00:24:16,879 --> 00:24:18,649
at like there's some really really great

594
00:24:18,649 --> 00:24:19,969
blogs if you want to know tweet me I'll

595
00:24:19,969 --> 00:24:21,919
send you some of them one of the best

596
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:23,779
things you can do to is go out and find

597
00:24:23,779 --> 00:24:26,029
this out for yourself don't expect every

598
00:24:26,029 --> 00:24:27,710
person from an underrepresented minority

599
00:24:27,710 --> 00:24:29,989
to go and be a text book for you the

600
00:24:29,989 --> 00:24:33,070
information is out there go find it

601
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:36,229
listen to them talk to them listen to

602
00:24:36,229 --> 00:24:39,529
them hear what they have to say having

603
00:24:39,529 --> 00:24:43,039
empathy for yourself which as I saying

604
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:45,589
was one of the most important things set

605
00:24:45,589 --> 00:24:47,960
healthy boundaries be in at a certain

606
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:50,210
time be out at a certain time something

607
00:24:50,210 --> 00:24:51,830
that I really enjoy doing at my last job

608
00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:54,739
I'm one of those people who like if I'm

609
00:24:54,739 --> 00:24:57,200
not into something I just can't do it

610
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,609
but the second I get like wired on it

611
00:24:58,609 --> 00:25:00,830
I'll just like work non-stop and usually

612
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:01,909
that happens it like two in the morning

613
00:25:01,909 --> 00:25:03,889
if you go on my github report card it's

614
00:25:03,889 --> 00:25:05,899
really funny and like starts and it like

615
00:25:05,899 --> 00:25:07,489
you know like eleven o'clock it goes up

616
00:25:07,489 --> 00:25:08,779
and I'm like three o'clock i'm really

617
00:25:08,779 --> 00:25:10,580
doing integer job and then it dumps

618
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:12,229
around like six when I go home and I

619
00:25:12,229 --> 00:25:13,489
hang out with Christina and then she

620
00:25:13,489 --> 00:25:14,719
usually goes to bed around eleven and

621
00:25:14,719 --> 00:25:15,979
that shoots up again around two in the

622
00:25:15,979 --> 00:25:17,389
morning and then it bottoms out around

623
00:25:17,389 --> 00:25:20,359
like four or five so I had to deal with

624
00:25:20,359 --> 00:25:22,489
my manager which was essentially hey if

625
00:25:22,489 --> 00:25:24,229
I have a really really good night and

626
00:25:24,229 --> 00:25:26,239
I'm really dialed in I'm going to work

627
00:25:26,239 --> 00:25:27,889
and you know what I'm not coming in the

628
00:25:27,889 --> 00:25:29,599
next day and it was fine because the

629
00:25:29,599 --> 00:25:31,849
work got done set healthy boundaries for

630
00:25:31,849 --> 00:25:33,919
yourself be honest with the people that

631
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:37,369
you work with listen to your body one

632
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:38,749
thing that I learned recently which was

633
00:25:38,749 --> 00:25:40,429
really great and I'm not going to lie I

634
00:25:40,429 --> 00:25:42,859
did it last night instead of staying up

635
00:25:42,859 --> 00:25:44,029
all night you know what I'll do is I'll

636
00:25:44,029 --> 00:25:45,830
go to sleep early and then wake up at

637
00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:47,149
like five in the morning and get things

638
00:25:47,149 --> 00:25:49,339
done when I'm well-rested think about

639
00:25:49,339 --> 00:25:50,929
how your body is if you're hungry eat if

640
00:25:50,929 --> 00:25:52,220
you're not hungry don't eat I like I

641
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:53,419
don't need to tell you that you know how

642
00:25:53,419 --> 00:25:56,690
to listen be aware of imposter syndrome

643
00:25:56,690 --> 00:25:57,810
it's a thing if

644
00:25:57,810 --> 00:25:59,160
you haven't heard about it google it if

645
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,780
you have heard about it stop doing it

646
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:04,800
we're all awesome but seriously like I

647
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:07,800
mean we're all pretty amazing people

648
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,480
like when you actually look at how many

649
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:11,370
people are able to do what we're doing

650
00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:13,230
in the world it's not many like

651
00:26:13,230 --> 00:26:15,180
recognize that recognize how amazing you

652
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:17,790
are don't tear yourself down you'll be

653
00:26:17,790 --> 00:26:20,340
the first person to do it listen to

654
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:22,260
yourself talk to yourself not in public

655
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:26,490
but talk to yourself okay so let's bring

656
00:26:26,490 --> 00:26:28,500
it all back let's repeat everything i

657
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:29,850
said before so we can think about it

658
00:26:29,850 --> 00:26:33,750
again let's hack time well we may be

659
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:36,990
soft wired for empathy the term is only

660
00:26:36,990 --> 00:26:39,650
existed for about a hundred years

661
00:26:39,650 --> 00:26:42,150
theresa Wiseman's defining attributes of

662
00:26:42,150 --> 00:26:43,560
empathy let's go over this one more time

663
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,270
do people want to say it with me or is

664
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:46,290
that just weird you want to say it with

665
00:26:46,290 --> 00:26:47,820
me that's cheesy I'm going to just say

666
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:51,480
it understand perspective stay out of

667
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:54,750
judgment recognize what they are feeling

668
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:59,580
and communicate it back it is important

669
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:01,740
to remember well our ability to be to

670
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:03,780
feel empathy may be soft wired our

671
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:06,020
ability to act on it is a learned trait

672
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:08,280
don't be down on yourself if you're not

673
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:11,340
naturally empathetic you you can build

674
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:13,800
on this you can learn and even if you're

675
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:16,530
not soft wired for it you can learn

676
00:27:16,530 --> 00:27:18,060
you're in this room because you're good

677
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:22,560
learners you can learn empathizing

678
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:25,410
requires for you to be vulnerable that

679
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:31,700
can be scary empathy is a choice

680
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:35,640
astronaut how am I unique but rather how

681
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:43,050
are we the same feel with people rarely

682
00:27:43,050 --> 00:27:45,380
can a response make something better

683
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:47,460
what makes something better is

684
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:52,110
connection maybe what you say doesn't

685
00:27:52,110 --> 00:27:55,590
matter maybe the only thing that matters

686
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:58,470
in the end are the relationships that

687
00:27:58,470 --> 00:28:08,340
you build thank you very much
