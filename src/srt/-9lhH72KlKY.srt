all of the talks are going to be live

35
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:04,079
captioned in real time yeah I think my

36
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:06,659
accent is not too bad we can we can get

37
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:09,840
that through there yeah we also have a

38
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,090
code of conduct of course and the

39
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:13,830
official kind of statement there is be

40
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:15,180
excellent to each other if you have any

41
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:17,460
problem you know reach out to us or any

42
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:18,930
of the organizers and we'll get that

43
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:25,050
sorted okay so if you've been to other

44
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:27,330
CSS comps GS comps before you might

45
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:29,250
notice we are in a brand new venue this

46
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:34,110
year arena Hall and oh and this is where

47
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:35,910
it is in the city this is where you are

48
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:39,690
right now just what if someone asks you

49
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:42,140
later

50
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:45,180
and so this amazing building was built

51
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:46,710
in nineteen twenty seven twenty eight

52
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:49,710
and at the time it was the largest like

53
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:53,070
free span in all of Europe and it was

54
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:58,920
built to house buses for the transit

55
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,720
company and I thought this was really

56
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,970
cool because the bus was also the

57
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:04,920
world's largest bus at the time this is

58
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:08,700
the 1927 store double-decker and so they

59
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:11,130
would fill this whole space with the

60
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:13,020
buses and clean them and store all of

61
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:15,800
the buses here we've come a long way I

62
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:18,660
feel like it was built in 1927 in

63
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:20,670
Australia I would not want to be under

64
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:22,860
the roof but considering its German it's

65
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:26,730
going to be here forever okay so we have

66
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:28,890
a ton of good sponsors you can see all

67
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:30,390

80
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:04,470
emcee presentations we kind of looked

81
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:06,930
through the previous ones and there was

82
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:08,640
Jed and there was Nick and there was a

83
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,330
ton of puns and a lot of CSS puns and

84
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:14,100
they were really good and I don't know

85
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:15,540
if you get this thing when you try to do

86
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:17,459
puns but whenever anybody says one you

87
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:18,810
like that was really good and I can't

88
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:21,479
use that now and I just think we're kind

89
00:04:21,479 --> 00:04:22,860
of done there they're all kind of

90
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:23,889
through

91
00:04:23,889 --> 00:04:25,060
so I kind of wanted to do something

92
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:27,520
different and we we kind of discussed

93
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,750
back and forth of what we're going to do

94
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:30,220
and we kind of came up with with

95
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:32,350
something that we've called the CSS come

96
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:34,270
party pack hashtag CSS compound crack

97
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:41,139
trademark patent pending yeah so yeah so

98
00:04:41,139 --> 00:04:44,169
one of the amazing things about this

99
00:04:44,169 --> 00:04:47,410
event about J's comp and this whole week

100
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:50,500
of events is the community right such an

101
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,030
amazing community there's so much going

102
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:54,850
on we really like being together with

103
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:57,850
everyone but maybe you don't have a

104
00:04:57,850 --> 00:05:00,610
community maybe you work remote and you

105
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:05,289
really want that feeling so I don't know

106
00:05:05,289 --> 00:05:07,870
if anybody has kind of knows me and I've

107
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:09,280
seen the things that I do I kind of like

108
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,220
to do this thing that I call bad cop'

109
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:13,690
development where you take a good thing

110
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:16,330
and you make it bad and you learn from

111
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:20,470
it and I've been working from home the

112
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:22,449
last con a couple of years and one thing

113
00:05:22,449 --> 00:05:24,509
that I've kind of missed is

114
00:05:24,509 --> 00:05:25,930
passive-agressive

115
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:29,680
office notes and this is kind of like

116
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,660
whenever I find a note in my house it's

117
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:33,430
me that left it to me oh you left the

118
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:36,639
banana out good one so I kind of wanted

119
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:38,169
to bring this back into back into my

120
00:05:38,169 --> 00:05:39,550
life so I made a passive-aggressive

121
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:43,360
office simulator blackpot it's going to

122
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,460
keep everyone kind of going and it's

123
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:48,880
very intelligent it's very well fed with

124
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,139
real live data

125
00:05:50,139 --> 00:05:51,490
don't forget the organ Amish lunch later

126
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:53,860
on what's the other no explanation can

127
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:55,510
go to that this is the third time this

128
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:56,770
year we've had to buy new folks at the

129
00:05:56,770 --> 00:05:57,909
office please don't take these home

130
00:05:57,909 --> 00:06:00,520
they're for everyone I actually have to

131
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:03,340
buy folks over a couple of years and it

132
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:04,930
kind of remembers things as well so

133
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:06,849
it'll be like whoever left the yogurt in

134
00:06:06,849 --> 00:06:08,530
the fridge please remove it and you're

135
00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:09,699
kind of sitting there and you forget

136
00:06:09,699 --> 00:06:11,440
about it and then a couple of weeks

137
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,940
later we like well it looks like no one

138
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:15,909
who removed the yogurt classic office

139
00:06:15,909 --> 00:06:18,880
life you can get it today see home accom

140
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:23,820
office has simulator

141
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:26,870
all right so not only do we benefit from

142
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:29,210
excellent German engineering in this

143
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:33,050
amazing space but we benefit from German

144
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:35,539
design and things like Bauhaus that are

145
00:06:35,539 --> 00:06:37,430
incorporated today and all kinds of

146
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:40,430
design and typography and so what could

147
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:43,759
be a really good way to tribute the

148
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:47,389
great German laughing everybody here

149
00:06:47,389 --> 00:06:48,919
really appreciates design that's a big

150
00:06:48,919 --> 00:06:51,979
part of CSS and of course I'm kind of

151
00:06:51,979 --> 00:06:54,050
again in this mindset of a bad cop

152
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:55,669
development so I've created something

153
00:06:55,669 --> 00:07:00,379
called smell vodka and anybody with any

154
00:07:00,379 --> 00:07:01,789
sense is going to start feeling

155
00:07:01,789 --> 00:07:04,610
uncomfortable at the kerning in this

156
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:07,819
Helvetica you can actually install this

157
00:07:07,819 --> 00:07:09,529
on your machine and this is what it

158
00:07:09,529 --> 00:07:10,159
looks like

159
00:07:10,159 --> 00:07:14,509

machine mow vet occur is the future all

168
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:40,969
right and so we also know that CSS has

169
00:07:40,969 --> 00:07:43,339
come a long way and people have done

170
00:07:43,339 --> 00:07:46,209
amazing games and animations created

171
00:07:46,209 --> 00:07:49,669
animation libraries and really great

172
00:07:49,669 --> 00:07:53,709
code pen examples of these silky smooth

173
00:07:53,709 --> 00:07:57,529
animation remember we do that yeah we

174
00:07:57,529 --> 00:07:58,999
have a lot of people that are going to

175
00:07:58,999 --> 00:08:00,169
talk about animations and things like

176
00:08:00,169 --> 00:08:01,669
this as well and it's super exciting and

177
00:08:01,669 --> 00:08:03,919
of course I'm the party pooper

178
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:08,120
so CSS come party pack I have created

179
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:11,199
something that I call obnoxious LCSs

180
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:13,610
rockin sub CSS is the future apart from

181
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:15,860
snow vatika and it's kind of like a take

182
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:18,139
on den eating's animated CSS except the

183
00:08:18,139 --> 00:08:22,689
