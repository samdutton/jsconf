9
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,390

10
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:41,820
that's me Francisco Spanish guy here

11
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:44,700
those are some bits of my digital life

12
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:46,380
okay so you can find Miller in Twitter

13
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:48,540
github and i'm working for telephonic a

14
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:52,340
digital and you are going to sing okay

15
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:54,960
why it's a guy from telefonica critical

16
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,450
digital talking about farfus first so

17
00:00:57,450 --> 00:00:59,190
let's start with a bit of history okay

18
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:01,320
and i will explain your why and talking

19
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:07,170
about this so in early 2011 and we are

20
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:08,880
telefonica digital started to realize

21
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:13,470
that the mobile landscape was already

22
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:18,360
dominated by two mainly brand and we

23
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,550
didn't like the way that it was that it

24
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:22,170
was working at all because the problem

25
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:25,229
was that or either do you have our real

26
00:01:25,229 --> 00:01:27,630
expensive device or you have a phone

27
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:28,950
that is not going to be updated at all

28
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:32,100
and talking about buying a iphone or

29
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:34,590
super nice android device that is like

30
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:38,310
500 600 pounds or either you buy a cheap

31
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:40,920
android phone let me show you the error

32
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:43,170
so we didn't like that at all because

33
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:44,970
especially we are really being that in

34
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:48,659
south america so we said okay we want to

35
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:50,760
do something we want to create a device

36
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:54,390
that is cheap that anyone can buy is

37
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:55,830
able to deliver the same experience that

38
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:59,100
you have in in your iphones and super

39
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:02,750
900 so in order to do that we decided to

40
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:05,939
to go for with quite technologies by the

41
00:02:05,939 --> 00:02:07,770
time we thought okay what technologies

42
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:09,509
are mature enough to deliver these kind

43
00:02:09,509 --> 00:02:11,099
of things we are going to create this

44
00:02:11,099 --> 00:02:12,450
phone and we are going to be biased

45
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:15,720
missing in this web technologies so we

46
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:16,950
were thinking about it we were

47
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:18,569
prototyping and so on and you know what

48
00:02:18,569 --> 00:02:21,689
happened and in two thousand june june

49
00:02:21,689 --> 00:02:24,779
july a theme past year Mazel already

50
00:02:24,779 --> 00:02:26,459
announced today about to make a project

51
00:02:26,459 --> 00:02:28,520
and it was like

52
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:32,300
do the same idea the same principles is

53
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:33,710
amazing in the other part of the world

54
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:35,450
there were other people having this

55
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:38,180
thing idea what we're going to do are we

56
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:41,600
going to compete with them go away we

57
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,190
call them we called Mozilla and say hey

58
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:45,170
guys we really love your idea within the

59
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:46,970
distinct level can we work together and

60
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:50,090
the answer was yes come on let's go and

61
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:52,760
that's what today I'm here ok so we

62
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:54,710
started working together I don't know

63
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:56,630
you guys see in the motorway Congress

64
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:59,330
you teach her prototype that we were

65
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:01,460
coming with two different new eyes using

66
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:03,020
the same back end we were already

67
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:04,460
collaborating band then we realize that

68
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:06,620
it was a waste of time and resources to

69
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:09,350
create in two separate you guys so we

70
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:12,200
said okay no stop it let's try to work

71
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,750
together and what we are doing so far is

72
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:17,120
the photo fast telefonica and gosh

73
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,880
Mozilla we are trying to achieve that

74
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,920
it's great fire sauce android loading

75
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,870
remember I said that we want to create a

76
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:26,930
cheap phone that is going to be able to

77
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:30,560
deliver that that experience okay so the

78
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,760
open where device is going to be this

79
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,260
first film is going to be launched in

80
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:36,380
Brazil in q1 next year okay so if you

81
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:39,530
count the number of moles that means

82
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:41,709
them Mozilla will be able to deliver a

83
00:03:41,709 --> 00:03:43,640
completely new and shiny operating

84
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,890
system in less than one year and a half

85
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:48,890
that's blow minding is incredible I mean

86
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:50,870
who is able to say that you can deliver

87
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:52,630
a new operating system in that that time

88
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:56,240
so remember what I want to do to realize

89
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:58,070
about the open where device is going to

90
00:03:58,070 --> 00:03:59,690
be a cheap phone really really cheap

91
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:01,190
whoa where you going to deliver that

92
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:05,540
kind of super nice experience and now

93
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:07,220
it's enough talking about open with

94
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:08,720
device Alyssa still talking about

95
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:12,500
Firefox OS okay so okay it's chip that

96
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:13,820
means that the resources that we are

97
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:14,900
going to have in the four are not like

98
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:16,880
the best one memory is not going to be

99
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,590
infinite the screen maybe is not the

100
00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:21,919
best one but experience is going to be

101
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:23,180
amazing on how we're going to deliver

102
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:26,300
that okay so five or six I want 50 sauce

103
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:28,940
is the one who is going to deliver that

104
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:33,230
experience all that is a prototype okay

105
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:35,660
think that that's a nice Firefox's I'm

106
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:36,710
going to explain you what are the

107
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:39,050
principles I went to there are going to

108
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:42,110
make fascist or becoming that I'm

109
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:44,840
theme from so we are going to have like

110
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,460
three layers in the up in the in the

111
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:49,280
whole phone and I go to explain the

112
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,380
three of em okay the first one is the

113
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:54,200
one that we call Gong Gong is a solid

114
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:57,980
linux okay stripers is a kernel is a

115
00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:00,500
linux running on the phone I'm here

116
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:03,440
Mozilla were really really smart instead

117
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,060
of saying okay let's reinvent the wheel

118
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:07,100
let's create our own version of lino

119
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:08,810
studies going to be able to run here no

120
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:11,600
no no no I this already are open source

121
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,820
project that does this is called Android

122
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:15,740
ok we have android this open-source

123
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:18,440
pretty cool let's remove the part i will

124
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:22,820
live from it java ok we're through java

125
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:25,640
and what we have is that solid a linux

126
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,830
kernel on toast relations oh and this is

127
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:29,390
pretty good is pretty nice which means

128
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:32,210
that Firefox OS is going to be quite

129
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:35,060
easy to port platforms are already

130
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:36,590
running on Android that's pretty

131
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:39,410
important ok that means that so far you

132
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:42,530
have like fastest horse running in

133
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:47,630
samsung galaxy s2 in galaxy nexus nexus

134
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:51,320
one prototype is and some LG phones and

135
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:53,660
so on and even things like raspberry pi

136
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:55,370
can you imagine you know it's like if

137
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:58,250
you are able to run android maybe well

138
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:00,320
you will be able to run at some point

139
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:02,600
fortunate fire forces I think that is

140
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:05,260
particular idea ok now we had this

141
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:08,720
colonel we have these drivers what else

142
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,380
we have another layer it's called gecko

143
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:14,240
I'm sure that this name is familiar for

144
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,940
you all ok this is the magic engine that

145
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:19,790
is powering the Firefox in your laptops

146
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:24,170
and your bro in your list of browsers is

147
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:25,910
the same one that is forwarding the fire

148
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:28,100
phone sauce ok and the good things about

149
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:29,870
it is like this is talking directly to

150
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:32,420
the that kernel and O's driver there is

151
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:34,460
not any other layer of operating system

152
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:36,740
behind it which means that we are saving

153
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:39,380
like a lot of resources you see here we

154
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:41,630
are just saving resources instead of

155
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:43,430
having needing like a lot of memory to

156
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:45,050
running an operating system and then

157
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:47,300
putting a brush during the top do is the

158
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:48,740
browser or they prostrate you've already

159
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:52,220
running here that's incredible but we

160
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:55,040
will need more things extra AP is in

161
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:55,920
order to

162
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,630
being able to run a phone because at the

163
00:06:57,630 --> 00:06:59,640
end of the day I phone needs to make

164
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:02,490
calls isn't it not it's like that ice

165
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:04,230
cream it's pretty cool but we need to be

166
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:06,510
close we need to send SMS and things

167
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:11,010
like that so later we will talk about

168
00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:13,200
all those new API is ok we will talk

169
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,570
about what Mozilla is doing for

170
00:07:15,570 --> 00:07:18,000
providing us with those aps in order to

171
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,540
create the phone and the last layer is

172
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:25,350
Gaia okay guy is just on you I but we

173
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:27,810
put in top of that process arranging and

174
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:29,580
we create the experience the user

175
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:31,050
experience for for the firefox sauce

176
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:33,870
it's called Gaia but at the other day

177
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:35,970
you just a set of web AP day web apps

178
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:38,340
you can create your own later I want to

179
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:39,900
show you that we can create whatever you

180
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:42,030
want so this is amazing and this is what

181
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:44,160
what today I will try to to show you

182
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,980
that is not just an operating system

183
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:50,220
that is a philosophy it's much more sour

184
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:53,990
things so let's stop talking about those

185
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:57,810
those api's so Mozilla is doing a

186
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:00,450
greater for its incredible is life okay

187
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:02,790
we don't have all the we need more

188
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:04,800
things we want to create a phone no we

189
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,420
need like making calls we need a

190
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:08,820
telephone API we need to make the phone

191
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:11,220
vibrate we will have a our vision API

192
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:13,710
but the most important thing for me is

193
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:15,660
not just that they are creating the

194
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:17,280
api's that they need they are trying to

195
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,380
standardize them that's quite important

196
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:21,810
okay that means that it's not okay i'm

197
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:22,980
going to create this no no no they're

198
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:24,480
going to the process talking with the

199
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:27,030
industry to talking with the standard

200
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:29,250
organizations in order to standardize

201
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:31,350
those those api's that's amazing that's

202
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:33,660
a really great year from them that means

203
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:36,660
that anyone can participate in defining

204
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:39,210
those api's discussing and things like

205
00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:40,950
that and that's very important guys that

206
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:42,900
you can go and start discussing what

207
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:45,030
what would you like to do to be working

208
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:47,460
on the SMS api all still like that so

209
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:50,610
please take a look to that wiki page and

210
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:52,290
you will realize that there is a lot of

211
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:56,340
new api's they're incredible sorry also

212
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:59,940
an important thing is some of those KPIs

213
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:02,460
are not just going to live in the phone

214
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:05,340
itself know all those ideas are going to

215
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:08,390
jump to the browser actually to in fact

216
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:10,970
the latest version of the browser

217
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:13,500
professionally already contains some of

218
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:17,010
those AP ice so that's an another great

219
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:19,770
effort and that's opening as well our

220
00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:22,770
new possibilities okay so now what I

221
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:25,050
would like to do is show you a bit of

222
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:26,610
code allowed to say p is what they are

223
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:28,350
doing and you will realize that at the

224
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:31,290
holiday this is just JavaScript so

225
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:32,700
that's an example of the delay phone the

226
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:35,520
API okay it's quite simple you can read

227
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,290
it it's not a problem you can understand

228
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:40,290
it is I've been oriented so whenever you

229
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:42,390
receive a call you have you have a cold

230
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:43,820
wet that to handle that call

231
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:47,370
synchronously you can do stuff so any

232
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:49,230
one of you can read that perfectly it

233
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:51,240
can understand it there's no like a

234
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,700
black magic there it's like quite simple

235
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:56,880
the same thing for sending SMS or

236
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,910
receiving SMS the code is quite simple

237
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:01,500
for you you all can understand perfectly

238
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,360
we don't mean having to explain it what

239
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,190
it's doing that's one of the great

240
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:08,060
things of this also more examples api's

241
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:10,740
the open web apps api this is one of my

242
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:12,330
favorite ones i would like to spend some

243
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:14,700
time explaining here open with us is

244
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:17,070
just a definition outside okay i have

245
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:19,140
this application the web application is

246
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:20,670
an application what I'm going to defying

247
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:22,740
is a manifest file very suggestion file

248
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:24,510
that contains things like name

249
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:28,440
description icons where's my lunch but I

250
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:31,050
things like that and also the API

251
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:33,390
provides a set of methods to installing

252
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:36,360
an application and installing it or even

253
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,710
querying all the applications are

254
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:40,500
installed this is an example of to say p

255
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,270
is that I told you that they are jumping

256
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:44,580
not just they are not just about to wake

257
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:46,680
oh okay they are also as well in the

258
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:49,110
Firefox nightly already so that means

259
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:52,080
you can install a web application in

260
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:54,660
whatever is running the gecko ng what it

261
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:56,130
means that the same applies in that you

262
00:10:56,130 --> 00:10:58,500
are going to run in the phone is the one

263
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,630
that you can run in a browser your

264
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:02,910
desktop is the same code is in render

265
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:05,490
the same thing so that's pretty cool

266
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:07,170
open with us or something that is

267
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:12,510
fantastic and you will think okay well

268
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:14,640
but this is just by Mozilla no just no

269
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,830
again until s doing therefore of

270
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:19,260
standardizing please I think that's

271
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:20,430
quite important okay

272
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:21,510
is not just one thing that they're

273
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:23,160
someone created this is something that

274
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:25,560
is going to is trying to become a

275
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:29,190
standard another example Web API is no

276
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:31,440
it's like this is for Android developers

277
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,390
is quite quite familiar okay this is

278
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:36,630
like hey please system there is an

279
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:37,950
application that is able to do some

280
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:41,130
tests for me like sending sms yes please

281
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:42,450
this is the phone number i want to send

282
00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:46,500
an SMS someone take take the task of

283
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,779
sending an SMS for me this is quite

284
00:11:48,779 --> 00:11:50,970
similar for for android and things like

285
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:52,920
that and also a good example of

286
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,540
standardization there is already

287
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:56,459
something like web intents from google

288
00:11:56,459 --> 00:11:58,290
okay machine on google are working

289
00:11:58,290 --> 00:12:01,440
together trying to have the same way of

290
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,810
auto in this country stuff so maybe in

291
00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:06,240
just three months time this becomes a

292
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,540
standard again again an example with

293
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:12,420
your Wi-Fi eph okay i could be talking

294
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:15,089
about VBS forever okay because there's a

295
00:12:15,089 --> 00:12:18,330
lot of them we have web Bluetooth API we

296
00:12:18,330 --> 00:12:21,630
have settings API that we have wet FM

297
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:24,300
API is incredible the new set of AP ice

298
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:26,880
that has been created for this all they

299
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,740
need javascript and all of them quite

300
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:30,810
easy to use for you so please take a

301
00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:32,130
look I mean for example you had a

302
00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:34,620
contacts API Gregor come on with your

303
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:38,970
hand raised here he created that API you

304
00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:41,070
know it's incredible I mean there's so

305
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:42,870
many things I'm what I want to do to

306
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:45,390
show and share with us I'd go there take

307
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:46,800
a look and you realize that you can

308
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,720
start doing incredible things with

309
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,410
JavaScript okay well I know also another

310
00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:54,140
in here would like to talk about the

311
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:57,240
connection connectivity API please this

312
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:59,130
is not just for using bout to waco you

313
00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:00,750
can detect when a user doesn't have

314
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:04,680
connections right now please use it okay

315
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:07,260
because we we are used to people having

316
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:09,150
connection having kabul cables having

317
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:11,360
with you and so on but in a mobile phone

318
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,430
people go offline quite often so please

319
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:16,440
turn into account okay not just for

320
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:21,480
Portugal for anything okay so we had a

321
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:24,450
set of API is incredible and I don't

322
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:26,220
know how big is the list is quite big I

323
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:28,529
can tell you what we created with those

324
00:13:28,529 --> 00:13:31,020
api's what we created with those api's

325
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:33,029
is the last part of the ice cream that

326
00:13:33,029 --> 00:13:34,110
you saw before

327
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:36,779
is the Gaia is the UX is the UX for this

328
00:13:36,779 --> 00:13:39,930
firefox operating system but what I

329
00:13:39,930 --> 00:13:43,740
Gallia is just a set of apps of open web

330
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,360
apps that once that I defined if you're

331
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:48,450
the ones that I said before so those are

332
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:51,420
screenshot taken from the phone I mean

333
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:52,980
those are not designs and things like

334
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:54,600
that that actually the implementation

335
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:57,420
okay so what you have on your on your

336
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:59,880
left is an example of the system

337
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,220
application is an open web app you can

338
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:04,200
go check it and you will realize that is

339
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:07,320
pure HTML Javascript and CSS nothing

340
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:10,380
else using those new API but at the

341
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:12,899
other day is whatever you're doing you

342
00:14:12,899 --> 00:14:15,990
are able to do I mean it's not black

343
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:19,320
magic go check it you have things like I

344
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:22,860
screen locker settings you have a lot of

345
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:24,839
applications for example that one that

346
00:14:24,839 --> 00:14:27,269
you have on your right is the home

347
00:14:27,269 --> 00:14:30,329
screen application in the first app that

348
00:14:30,329 --> 00:14:31,950
you see when you when you open the

349
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:34,800
engine on stuff own this home screen

350
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,420
application what is doing is something's

351
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:39,120
really really simple is going and using

352
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,760
the open web apps API asking how many

353
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,560
applications you have installed going

354
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,720
through them and showing and present in

355
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,610
the icons for its application in a grid

356
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:50,790
format but think about this this is an

357
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:53,459
HTML Adam that you can modify and you

358
00:14:53,459 --> 00:14:55,709
can do whatever you want in this case we

359
00:14:55,709 --> 00:14:58,740
are showing a grid okay by you it's up

360
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:00,750
to you I mean you can decide to show

361
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:03,870
wherever you want if you have a new idea

362
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:06,630
and want to do it on 3d or wherever is

363
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:09,209
there okay that's important thing that

364
00:15:09,209 --> 00:15:11,399
you can do whatever you want you have a

365
00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:15,990
white canvas here to do a staff so more

366
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:18,240
things native why what means negative

367
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:21,959
here is quite funny native this lady

368
00:15:21,959 --> 00:15:24,570
with the web is the native here the open

369
00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:26,160
web is this thing that you don't need

370
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:29,279
anything else firefox sauce is was made

371
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:32,760
for am by the web so remember i love

372
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,260
that trace that said the web is the

373
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:36,839
platform yes it is okay so these are

374
00:15:36,839 --> 00:15:39,269
examples are the native dialer and the

375
00:15:39,269 --> 00:15:41,160
native contacts are just web

376
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:43,649
applications that can run in the Firefox

377
00:15:43,649 --> 00:15:45,899
browser for example the only thing that

378
00:15:45,899 --> 00:15:47,790
you will need at this set of ApS that we

379
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:48,030
say

380
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:51,960
before for example just think about it I

381
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:55,170
learn what the tire is doing so far it's

382
00:15:55,170 --> 00:15:56,850
quite simple we had the settings API

383
00:15:56,850 --> 00:15:59,940
okay so we are going to store a we have

384
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:02,010
the vibration API for example so we are

385
00:16:02,010 --> 00:16:04,200
going to store if we need to vibrate and

386
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:08,000
we need to ring also in settings when we

387
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,520
store we can store the ringtone for the

388
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:13,560
phone so what we do is just check the

389
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,240
settings API when we receive an incoming

390
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:18,060
call check we need to vibrate or make a

391
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:21,960
sound we have a node and I will do note

392
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,670
in the dome where we change the source

393
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:27,030
pointing it to the audio file that we

394
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:28,650
want to make the song and we start

395
00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:31,500
playing whenever we get the call we stop

396
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,720
playing this like that you know it's

397
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:37,860
like it's not really complicated I mean

398
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:40,740
of course it has her for a bit more of

399
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:42,960
science here but what I mean is I using

400
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,790
your hands to modify the way that this

401
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:50,600
does this work so how do we create it

402
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:54,600
this application is open web apps so far

403
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:57,630
I didn't mention anything about an SDK

404
00:16:57,630 --> 00:17:01,020
you know when you are trying to working

405
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,160
on your platform the first thing that

406
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,230
you think about is like which the SDK

407
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:08,870
how I can work on it there is no SDK why

408
00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:13,650
because this is the open web lass anyone

409
00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:15,150
tells you how you had to create your

410
00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:19,200
website no one why should Mozilla tell

411
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,300
you how you have to create web apps for

412
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:25,350
the phone remember the phone 53 sauce is

413
00:17:25,350 --> 00:17:27,540
made for the open web so no one is going

414
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:29,250
to tell you how you have to create your

415
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:31,740
of your webs so there's the reason why

416
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:34,110
there is no like SDK there is not

417
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:36,030
something like that also take into

418
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:37,890
account that we said that the phone has

419
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:41,340
a really limited number of resources so

420
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:43,380
instead of using a standard on generic

421
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:45,690
libraries we decided to create a

422
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:48,390
specific vanilla plain JavaScript just

423
00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:50,040
to save in memory and things like that

424
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:54,690
okay but what we did is like okay once

425
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:56,940
all of the old UX people get together

426
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:59,520
and and they decided how they look and

427
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,860
feel the phone was looking

428
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:03,780
for the developers like like me what we

429
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:06,990
did is like okay we need to kind of use

430
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:08,610
have the same look and feel at least for

431
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:09,660
the applications that we are going to

432
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:11,549
ship at the beginning and what we have

433
00:18:11,549 --> 00:18:14,010
is lie so it's a guideline this

434
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:15,480
guideline is what we call building

435
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:18,240
blocks building blocks is another open

436
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,820
source project ok just to define the

437
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:23,340
markup and the CSS that the application

438
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:26,600
shall have that's just a recommendation

439
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:29,040
doesn't mean that you need to use it for

440
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,570
us or developers working right now in

441
00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:32,309
the project is a way of creating

442
00:18:32,309 --> 00:18:34,710
applications in a faster way so there

443
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:37,290
were we have issues just the markup and

444
00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:40,140
the CSS no javascript cuz remember these

445
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:41,850
are the things that we can do so far

446
00:18:41,850 --> 00:18:43,679
without JavaScript transitions an

447
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:46,830
emergency like that we don't need to to

448
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:48,480
go and modify the Dom for doing that

449
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:51,330
it's better that we let the CSS ng into

450
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:54,090
to do this thing for us so the building

451
00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:56,130
blocks you will have a list of common

452
00:18:56,130 --> 00:18:58,200
companies that we are using we are

453
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,059
repeating across the applications that

454
00:19:00,059 --> 00:19:02,940
we're going to lunch okay so yeah that's

455
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:05,270
the building blocks go there take a look

456
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:08,309
at you will realize so now is the time

457
00:19:08,309 --> 00:19:11,250
for trying it I told you this is running

458
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:14,340
in several devices already but I'm sure

459
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:17,250
that you want to try it now you can do

460
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:18,929
it I was telling you this is the open

461
00:19:18,929 --> 00:19:21,240
web you don't need the physic physically

462
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:24,059
default for trying it so here is like

463
00:19:24,059 --> 00:19:26,160
there are like three metal three ways of

464
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,950
of trying it first is Firefox nightly as

465
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:31,230
I said it's like they are sharing the

466
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:34,470
same a magical engine because we go it's

467
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:37,049
the same one you won't have somewhat

468
00:19:37,049 --> 00:19:38,790
open API so you already have in bought

469
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:40,650
you a go but basically if you want to

470
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:42,360
test the look and feel on everything

471
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:44,850
wherever renders preferably in Firefox

472
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:46,710
nightly will render perfectly in Firefox

473
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:49,590
OS okay so that's pretty cool you can go

474
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:52,530
download it it's pretty nice then you

475
00:19:52,530 --> 00:19:54,600
have BTW but to gecko yes it's

476
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,429
cross-platform and you can compile it

477
00:19:56,429 --> 00:19:58,980
for your own and architecture not just

478
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:01,410
for the phone itself this is like a pure

479
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:05,250
emulator this contains all the aps is

480
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:06,960
exactly the same software is running in

481
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,790
the device but you can have it on your

482
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:10,890
you can have it on your on your machine

483
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:14,429
okay oh and also mozilla is is providing

484
00:20:14,429 --> 00:20:15,779
us nightly builds for this

485
00:20:15,779 --> 00:20:17,249
so you don't have to compile it you can

486
00:20:17,249 --> 00:20:19,049
click just go there under load it for

487
00:20:19,049 --> 00:20:21,090
your for your operating system it's

488
00:20:21,090 --> 00:20:22,200
pretty cool is the same thing that you

489
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:25,019
have in the in the form but you have it

490
00:20:25,019 --> 00:20:27,960
on your key architecture this week or

491
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:30,929
one week ago this new thing that is

492
00:20:30,929 --> 00:20:36,090
called r2d2 v2g that actually stands for

493
00:20:36,090 --> 00:20:39,299
ready to deliver to boot to gecko is a

494
00:20:39,299 --> 00:20:41,969
political extension you need to install

495
00:20:41,969 --> 00:20:45,509
in your in your Firefox nightly ok what

496
00:20:45,509 --> 00:20:48,210
it does is like it as it adds an extra

497
00:20:48,210 --> 00:20:50,309
menu and if you are browsing our web

498
00:20:50,309 --> 00:20:53,009
page you can click and install it and

499
00:20:53,009 --> 00:20:55,589
what it will do it will launch a BG

500
00:20:55,589 --> 00:20:57,749
emulator with that application already

501
00:20:57,749 --> 00:20:59,849
installer and you can check it you don't

502
00:20:59,849 --> 00:21:02,729
have to configure it or things like that

503
00:21:02,729 --> 00:21:05,639
so i will highly recommend to you i

504
00:21:05,639 --> 00:21:07,609
would highly recommend to you guys to

505
00:21:07,609 --> 00:21:13,019
try to using this this new sniffing and

506
00:21:13,019 --> 00:21:15,690
once that you try hopefully you will

507
00:21:15,690 --> 00:21:17,129
feel what I'm feeling when I working on

508
00:21:17,129 --> 00:21:19,919
this project for me is a predator is

509
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:22,979
basically means freedom the freedom of

510
00:21:22,979 --> 00:21:25,039
creating anything that is on my mind

511
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:27,509
firefall sauce is the chance that we

512
00:21:27,509 --> 00:21:29,759
have for first participating in a

513
00:21:29,759 --> 00:21:31,739
project being able to collaborate and

514
00:21:31,739 --> 00:21:34,109
decide how things are working but also

515
00:21:34,109 --> 00:21:35,999
Mozilla is giving us the chance or

516
00:21:35,999 --> 00:21:38,399
creating these things in this white

517
00:21:38,399 --> 00:21:41,369
canvas what right now we are running

518
00:21:41,369 --> 00:21:43,979
gaya you can create wherever you want ok

519
00:21:43,979 --> 00:21:45,779
whatever you want even when I say

520
00:21:45,779 --> 00:21:48,029
whatever you want means whatever you

521
00:21:48,029 --> 00:21:50,249
want right now we are creating a phone

522
00:21:50,249 --> 00:21:52,649
but you can decide this to create any

523
00:21:52,649 --> 00:21:55,469
other thing is an open web app you

524
00:21:55,469 --> 00:21:57,539
create web apps so you can put something

525
00:21:57,539 --> 00:21:59,249
on the phone that the first thing that

526
00:21:59,249 --> 00:22:01,099
it does when he runs whatever you decide

527
00:22:01,099 --> 00:22:04,369
ok an example of this is is this this is

528
00:22:04,369 --> 00:22:07,379
a considered a colleague on me that is

529
00:22:07,379 --> 00:22:10,259
working next to me it's had in mind okay

530
00:22:10,259 --> 00:22:12,179
he's not working in the project but he

531
00:22:12,179 --> 00:22:14,759
sit next to me and I always telling him

532
00:22:14,759 --> 00:22:16,619
this is amazing this is amazing try I

533
00:22:16,619 --> 00:22:19,799
try and he he can with this idea i'm

534
00:22:19,799 --> 00:22:21,779
going to create a phone for other people

535
00:22:21,779 --> 00:22:24,359
the littler the phone is going to do is

536
00:22:24,359 --> 00:22:27,960
just too much has some for quick dials

537
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,760
or so i'm going to the files

538
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:32,010
zones and I'm going to track the people

539
00:22:32,010 --> 00:22:34,410
with the GPS if the people get out of

540
00:22:34,410 --> 00:22:37,380
the safe zone i'm going to send a signal

541
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:40,440
and things like that he came with this

542
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:44,060
design and literally just in two weeks

543
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:46,800
that was running on the phone and that's

544
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:49,590
not just a simple application that's why

545
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:51,920
you have when you turn on the phone that

546
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:54,240
device what he's doing is just doing

547
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,880
that okay what it means and you can

548
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,230
create whatever you want in this case

549
00:22:58,230 --> 00:23:00,300
it's a phone that what it does is just

550
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:03,120
having these four quick dials but again

551
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:05,520
this is a blank canvas what you have in

552
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,680

553
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,060
computer will extremely good

554
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:11,040
communication capabilities and a lot of

555
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:13,980
sensors so imagine the amount of things

556
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:17,010
that you can do is incredible so it's

557
00:23:17,010 --> 00:23:20,460

new incredible staff so please start

559
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:25,620

560
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:27,810
new ideas are you can start creating

561
00:23:27,810 --> 00:23:31,170
with these um yes it will blow your mind

562
00:23:31,170 --> 00:23:33,600

know like it's in your hands please

566
00:23:40,770 --> 00:23:45,360
please do it also you yesterday I saw

567
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:48,840
they actually the presenters measuring

568
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,670
their time and I'm really bad with

569
00:23:50,670 --> 00:23:52,860
timing conferences so I decided to

570
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:55,320
create an application that measures the

571
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:58,050
time ok so is here I used to spend 15

572
00:23:58,050 --> 00:24:00,450
minutes creating that web application

573
00:24:00,450 --> 00:24:02,790
and if you think about it it is a timer

574
00:24:02,790 --> 00:24:05,850
and you're updating each second just to

575
00:24:05,850 --> 00:24:07,710
show the time there it took me 15

576
00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:09,630
minutes guys for you it will taper all

577
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:13,260
the time ok so what what with this what

578
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:14,550
I can what I want to tell you is like

579
00:24:14,550 --> 00:24:18,180

584
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:30,660

and the top thank you

600
00:25:18,299 --> 00:25:22,209
I have one question I've been a palm

601
00:25:22,209 --> 00:25:25,119
user for a long time I had every rep OS

602
00:25:25,119 --> 00:25:28,359
device possible and it's open web breath

603
00:25:28,359 --> 00:25:31,209
this is the same thing why the hell do

604
00:25:31,209 --> 00:25:33,759
we need this well because we didn't have

605
00:25:33,759 --> 00:25:36,549
webos hope until this week and this has

606
00:25:36,549 --> 00:25:38,469
been open source since I know it like

607
00:25:38,469 --> 00:25:40,899
one year ago maybe now it's taina work

608
00:25:40,899 --> 00:25:43,539
together and I think that the two

609
00:25:43,539 --> 00:25:45,190
projects have to learn a lot from each

610
00:25:45,190 --> 00:25:47,949
other but so far Weber's wasn't open

611
00:25:47,949 --> 00:25:50,619
till literally this move this tuesday i

612
00:25:50,619 --> 00:25:54,669
think so this another chance this is the

613
00:25:54,669 --> 00:25:57,729
open web we have several changes several

614
00:25:57,729 --> 00:26:06,219
options to go for them could you detail

615
00:26:06,219 --> 00:26:09,159
steps i would have to take two runners

616
00:26:09,159 --> 00:26:12,969
on my phone yeah if you want to running

617
00:26:12,969 --> 00:26:14,709
in your phone actually what you had to

618
00:26:14,709 --> 00:26:17,889
check is not the guy a project is the BG

619
00:26:17,889 --> 00:26:20,349
project and there there is a list of

620
00:26:20,349 --> 00:26:22,239
steps that you have to follow so

621
00:26:22,239 --> 00:26:24,549
basically the loader repo connect your

622
00:26:24,549 --> 00:26:26,949
phone and execute configure and execute

623
00:26:26,949 --> 00:26:29,169
make it will download some wineries

624
00:26:29,169 --> 00:26:31,749
there are proprietary that's why we

625
00:26:31,749 --> 00:26:36,459
cannot distribute distribute images of

626
00:26:36,459 --> 00:26:37,959
the phone because it contains

627
00:26:37,959 --> 00:26:40,149
proprietary firmware but during the

628
00:26:40,149 --> 00:26:41,859
build process that firmware is

629
00:26:41,859 --> 00:26:43,779
downloaded and then put it back to their

630
00:26:43,779 --> 00:26:49,119
to the device it's quite simple so i can

631
00:26:49,119 --> 00:26:51,579
run firefox on my android phone will

632
00:26:51,579 --> 00:26:54,069
avail to run chrome on this I'm chrome

633
00:26:54,069 --> 00:27:01,929
uh I server you a question I I never try

634
00:27:01,929 --> 00:27:03,879
well I try but there are some things

635
00:27:03,879 --> 00:27:06,699
that are that are not looking completely

636
00:27:06,699 --> 00:27:09,729
ok because as you know they still there

637
00:27:09,729 --> 00:27:11,049
are some differences between the two

638
00:27:11,049 --> 00:27:17,229
engines so Chrome's a nice if C C++ app

639
00:27:17,229 --> 00:27:18,699
so it's not actually impossible to run a

640
00:27:18,699 --> 00:27:21,789
c++ I upon this hey know what's far as I

641
00:27:21,789 --> 00:27:23,469
know maybe they people from Mozilla can

642
00:27:23,469 --> 00:27:25,719
tell you know yesterday but as far as I

643
00:27:25,719 --> 00:27:27,429
know what you are running on the phone

644
00:27:27,429 --> 00:27:29,549
are pure web apps

645
00:27:29,549 --> 00:27:34,169
so its web what you run any more

646
00:27:34,169 --> 00:27:38,220

00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:39,989
