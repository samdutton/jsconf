1
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:21,400

you

2
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:24,529


3
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:27,000
so I'm actually giving my talk on my

4
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,499
surface not because I want to increase

5
00:00:28,499 --> 00:00:30,570
the number of Windows users from four to

6
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:33,030
five in the room or to see if it works

7
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:35,790
on an incline which it does for now

8
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:37,769
thankfully is a lip here at the end but

9
00:00:37,769 --> 00:00:40,820
because I think it really represents a

10
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:43,409
new class of machines that we need to

11
00:00:43,409 --> 00:00:47,659
think about as web developers whoops

12
00:00:47,659 --> 00:01:08,820
hopefully come on okay aha oh I'm going

13
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:16,740
to restart though here's my demo for

14
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:22,049
later and the reason that it really

15
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:24,479
represents a new class of machines is

16
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:27,990
that the the web and unless you've been

17
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:29,640
trapped underneath a rock you know that

18
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:32,100
the web has mobile web has been great

19
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:33,479
you know increasing really really

20
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:46,889
rapidly

21
00:01:46,899 --> 00:01:58,690
sorry

22
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:06,660
okay let's try this again yay okay so as

23
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:09,810
you know thank you I knew it was a huge

24
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:11,490
risk using the surface I'm gonna push

25
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:13,470
out anyway so as you know unless you've

26
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:15,690
been trapped underneath a rock the usage

27
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:17,190
of the mobile web is increasing at a

28
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:19,290
phenomenal rate right that's that

29
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:21,150
shouldn't be a surprise it to anybody if

30
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:22,580
you were underneath the rock you know

31
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:25,950
welcome back other news the Berlin Wall

32
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:29,040
has fallen but what really compounds

33
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,870
this and the reason that I brought the

34
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:34,620
surface up is that it's not only it's

35
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:36,300
not only mobile devices that are getting

36
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:38,610
touched but also desktop devices and

37
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:40,739
assert their surface is emblematic of

38
00:02:40,739 --> 00:02:43,530
that what that really means is that in

39
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:47,670
as we think about our websites is that

40
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:50,400
touch is really going forward going to

41
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,090
be the predominant way that people use

42
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:57,510
the web I'm going to pick on so some of

43
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:58,950
the research we've done is part of the

44
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:01,620
surface is there's you know obviously

45
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:03,600
patterns that don't work with the web or

46
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,400
with the touchable web and one of them

47
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:08,640
I'm gonna pick on is the hover obviously

48
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,959
hover does not work with touch a web

49
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:11,640
there's no state when you're using your

50
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:15,239
finger where you're not you know you're

51
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:17,459
not your kind of over a bit but not on

52
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:19,560
it and i'm going to pick on that but

53
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,060
there's number of other UI techniques

54
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:23,989
like that and our research we found that

55
00:03:23,989 --> 00:03:26,160
over sixty-five percent of websites

56
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:28,830
we're using some mechanism like this

57
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:30,930
that made it very difficult views at a

58
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:33,090
very high level you I technique to use a

59
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:35,880
touchable web so I ask is that if you're

60
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,440
one of those 65 I have a look at your

61
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,060
website and make sure you're not you're

62
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:41,880
not breaking the touchable web the

63
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,739
second thing I want to think it wanted

64
00:03:43,739 --> 00:03:46,560
you to think about is that the touchable

65
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,910
web means that you need to think about

66
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:50,160
the size of your touch targets and as

67
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:52,650
part of doing the surface we did a lot

68
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:54,450
of research around what's the optimal

69
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:57,420
size of touch targets and we did that we

70
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:59,100
measured people's fingers we found that

71
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:02,430
the kids when they first are able to use

72
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:04,200
a touch with where they've roughly eight

73
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:07,380
millimeter fingers up to the largest may

74
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:10,440
our adult has you know roughly a 19 in

75
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,700
millimeter finger

76
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:15,599
with kind of a 11 millimeter average and

77
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:18,120
we use that to do research on what the

78
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,220
smallest target size or kind of the

79
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:22,740
optimal target size you should use and

80
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:24,270
so we ran a bunch of experiments

81
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:27,470
changing the size of the touch target

82
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:29,910
over a range of different values and

83
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:32,280
what we found is that as you went below

84
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:35,190
five millimeters asymptotically the

85
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:37,080
error rate at which they you know the

86
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,700
error rate they had trying to complete

87
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:41,700
that task went up asymptotically and

88
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:43,290
it's compounded by the fact that they

89
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:46,200
spent asymptotically more time trying to

90
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:49,260
select that that particular touch target

91
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:51,060
so what our research showed was that

92
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:53,070
somewhere between seven and nine

93
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:55,020
millimeters for a touch target is kind

94
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:57,150
of the kind of the sweet spot and an on

95
00:04:57,150 --> 00:04:58,830
screen that works out to something like

96
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:02,250
forty to fifty pixels eighty-five

97
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:03,870
percent of sites that we looked at had

98
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:06,270
some some page that violated into this

99
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:09,840
this rule and made it hard for touch

100
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,460
users to you so if you're one of you

101
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:14,610
know if you're building a navigation

102
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:18,150
that you want used on and devices with

103
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:19,590
touch I encourage you to look to make

104
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:20,880
sure that you're not one is eighty-five

105
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:25,320
percent another thing we did is we

106
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,539
looked at kind of a heat map of where is

107
00:05:27,539 --> 00:05:30,780
easy for people to to to reach on their

108
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:33,000
on their mobile device and this is an

109
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,100
example we use for the surface the green

110
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:36,690
area show the areas that are very easy

111
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:40,830
to reach for the 90 percentile of users

112
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:43,590
the red areas are the people with the

113
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:45,240
biggest hands and then kind of the 10th

114
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:48,120
percentile and what's obvious from this

115
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,789
is that the middle right and left are

116
00:05:50,789 --> 00:05:53,700
the easiest places for people to to to

117
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:55,530
hit touch targets they have the most

118
00:05:55,530 --> 00:05:57,630
accuracy they're the most you know

119
00:05:57,630 --> 00:06:00,240
ergonomically correct and so as you're

120
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,800
thinking about this and what we do at

121
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,889
Microsoft is as we guidance we give our

122
00:06:04,889 --> 00:06:08,760
designers is essentially that that the

123
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,889
the band that runs kind of in a you from

124
00:06:10,889 --> 00:06:12,599
the left and the right middle down

125
00:06:12,599 --> 00:06:14,490
through the bottom and back up are the

126
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:15,900
best places to have your interaction

127
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:18,210
area and on the phone probably makes a

128
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:19,560
lot of intuitive sense kind of in the

129
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,940
middle of the screen are the best places

130
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:23,280
to have your touch targets it's kind of

131
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,289
the opposite for where you want

132
00:06:25,289 --> 00:06:28,080
people to be able to read so in terms of

133
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,930
reading areas the places where the hands

134
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:33,899
are not obscuring the screen you know

135
00:06:33,899 --> 00:06:36,360
work out to be the best places to have

136
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,669
to have touch targets that's probably

137
00:06:38,669 --> 00:06:42,479
not not very surprising didn't Evo's in

138
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:45,539
this room the other thing I wanted to

139
00:06:45,539 --> 00:06:51,689
mention is good okay is that people come

140
00:06:51,689 --> 00:06:53,849
from native applications to them to the

141
00:06:53,849 --> 00:06:55,289
you know the touchable what a lot of

142
00:06:55,289 --> 00:06:58,830
expectations so they they expect to be

143
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:01,949
able to use multi multi point gestures

144
00:07:01,949 --> 00:07:03,539
in order to control the web and a lot of

145
00:07:03,539 --> 00:07:05,819
browsers have implemented that natively

146
00:07:05,819 --> 00:07:08,389
to kind of keep up with that expectation

147
00:07:08,389 --> 00:07:11,069
but obviously building an application

148
00:07:11,069 --> 00:07:14,189
like this within the browser is is

149
00:07:14,189 --> 00:07:16,169
something that's been beyond us and so

150
00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:18,089
as Angelina said we've been working with

151
00:07:18,089 --> 00:07:21,659
the w3c and it's not just us it's it's

152
00:07:21,659 --> 00:07:23,520
Mozilla we jointly proposed this with

153
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:27,059
Mozilla and a lot of thanks to them to

154
00:07:27,059 --> 00:07:29,309
bring a unified model for these these

155
00:07:29,309 --> 00:07:31,319
pointer devices that are beyond the

156
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:33,269
mouse we've been using you know

157
00:07:33,269 --> 00:07:36,240
essentially a mouse event model for the

158
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,120
last 15 odd years it really assumes that

159
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,469
there's only there's only a mouse

160
00:07:40,469 --> 00:07:42,779
attached to the computer we need we need

161
00:07:42,779 --> 00:07:45,599
to improve on that and it's moved from a

162
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:47,789
first public working draft or candidate

163
00:07:47,789 --> 00:07:50,610
recommendation in roughly five months

164
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:52,949
which we think you know demonstrators

165
00:07:52,949 --> 00:07:54,300
there's a lot of lot of momentum and

166
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:55,740
recognition that this is a real a real

167
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:58,830
problem and so I'm going to spend the

168
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:00,809
rest of the kind of presentation working

169
00:08:00,809 --> 00:08:02,939
through what that means and essentially

170
00:08:02,939 --> 00:08:06,389
the top level in a way to think about

171
00:08:06,389 --> 00:08:08,729
this is it's an evolution of mouse

172
00:08:08,729 --> 00:08:12,869
events to be more general uses the same

173
00:08:12,869 --> 00:08:15,330
event model more or less you can drop in

174
00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:17,309
pointer events for Mouse events and your

175
00:08:17,309 --> 00:08:18,749
applications should still work the same

176
00:08:18,749 --> 00:08:22,169
we have added one event a pointer cancel

177
00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:24,479
event which is primarily used for when

178
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:26,219
there's an orientation change in it it

179
00:08:26,219 --> 00:08:30,360
makes sense to not process the maybe

180
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,880
some some previous touch events that

181
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,219
have occurred but otherwise it's very

182
00:08:35,219 --> 00:08:38,200
similar what has changed is we've added

183
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,780
number of attributes to provide a richer

184
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:44,020
model for handling handling pointer

185
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:47,140
events but your existing button client

186
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:49,150
ex-client why those attributes remain

187
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:52,480
the same have the same semantics are

188
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,840
still available to you as web developers

189
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:57,750
and so working through them one by one

190
00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:01,480
width and height provides you with the

191
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:04,270
ability to have the you know or the

192
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:06,550
recognition that in the real world many

193
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:08,230
pointing devices have a real physical

194
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:10,690
size and kind of the canonical example

195
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:13,180
of that is your finger your finger can

196
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:16,030
have a small amount of contact area if

197
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:18,430
you're using your fingernail and

198
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:20,560
obviously a larger one if you're pushing

199
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,080
down very hard and so this is passed

200
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:25,170
through in terms in a bounding box

201
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:27,910
around the client AXA client why that

202
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:30,070
gives you some indication of how much of

203
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:33,100
the the pointing utter devices in is

204
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:35,170
intersecting with the screen and this

205
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:39,790
obviously see this later is it is a good

206
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:41,260
way of doing things like finger painting

207
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:42,520
applications where you want to have that

208
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:45,120
richness of of taking advantage of that

209
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,940
intersection with the screen there's

210
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:51,370
also the concept of pressure for screens

211
00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:54,970
that support it and tilt accident tilt

212
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:58,150
why pressure is what you'd expect if the

213
00:09:58,150 --> 00:10:00,670
digitizer surface or screen supports it

214
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:02,590
it gives you an indication of how much

215
00:10:02,590 --> 00:10:04,560
pressure is being applied to the screen

216
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:08,710
tilt tilt accent tilt why are you know

217
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:10,780
probably the canonical example there is

218
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:13,300
a pen where you might want to have a

219
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:14,770
different effect on the screen depending

220
00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:16,120
on the tilt you know prove it but

221
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:19,240
perhaps apply a sonography kind of

222
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,710
different line style or what not to

223
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:24,890
match up with the users expectation

224
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:30,030
these to provide you know the ability to

225
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:34,900
understand more to handle separates so I

226
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:36,610
point of type it gives you the ability

227
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:41,050
to handle pointer devices differently in

228
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:42,340
general you're going to want to handle

229
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:44,890
them the same but pointer type allows

230
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:46,540
you to handle you know for instance a

231
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:48,010
pen device differently from a mouse

232
00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:50,410
device in you know situations where

233
00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:51,250
that's important

234
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:53,440
and then pointer ID is kind of a new

235
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,600
concept because there can be multiple

236
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,970
streams of pointer events if you think

237
00:10:57,970 --> 00:10:59,290
about if you have two or three fingers

238
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:01,540
on the screen at once those are actually

239
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:04,600
all separate pointer devices in terms of

240
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,670
in terms of this event model and so

241
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:08,740
pointer ID allows you to disambiguate

242
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:10,750
all those different events dreams so

243
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:12,310
that you can handle them in the way that

244
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:13,240
makes the most sense for your

245
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:17,740
application all right so I'm going to

246
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:23,170
switch over and do a demo all right

247
00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:27,280
great and so the devil i'm going to do

248
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:29,470
is really simple finger painting

249
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:31,450
application not sure how visible that is

250
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:33,940
it's fairly visible and basically have a

251
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:38,320
canvas I've added some pointer events

252
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:41,770
here as additive as event listeners I'm

253
00:11:41,770 --> 00:11:44,350
using in navigators pointer enabled

254
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:47,280
which tells you if this if player

255
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:49,720
pointer events are possible in your

256
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:52,270
browser there's two types of that in

257
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:54,280
ie10 we actually have the vendor

258
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:57,070
prefixed version and then as as browsers

259
00:11:57,070 --> 00:11:58,930
adopt this there'll be a non prefixed

260
00:11:58,930 --> 00:12:02,260
version called pointer enabled and then

261
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:04,839
from there every time we get an event we

262
00:12:04,839 --> 00:12:06,640
start painting I'm going to maintain a

263
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:11,310
list of essentially four points and then

264
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:15,040
as we get individual pain events I am

265
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,170
going to just do a curve between all

266
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:19,060
those those points that we've built up

267
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:22,930
and and finally as we're doing multiple

268
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:24,880
of these will shift them off the end and

269
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,650
Athen do went to it so it's pretty

270
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:27,910
straightforward I'll show you what that

271
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:32,140
looks like I just thought of a problem

272
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:35,110
okay so when you know the mouse this

273
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:38,800
work this works perfectly fortunate I

274
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,210
didn't die didn't think about this

275
00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:44,770
problem but when you touch it it also

276
00:12:44,770 --> 00:12:48,040
has this problem I have is that because

277
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,420
I'm displaying on the screen I can't

278
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:51,940
touch this screen but imagine that was a

279
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:58,030
touch let's see okay so the problem you

280
00:12:58,030 --> 00:13:00,310
have there is that we're not using so if

281
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:01,690
you look back at this code we're not

282
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:05,180
using we're not using the point

283
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:09,050
our ID to actually to actually

284
00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:10,790
disambiguate the different streams so if

285
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,710
I had to use multi-touch there it would

286
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:14,030
it would have done back and forth across

287
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:15,860
the to the different streams of events

288
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:19,220
that we're we're being received by the

289
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:23,660
browser and so to disambiguate that and

290
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:26,270
this in this example I'm using a pointer

291
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:28,430
ID to eventually to basically build up

292
00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:33,080
separate sets of content and so when we

293
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,670
draw the lines will be a separate lists

294
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:37,550
and it in it in it and it'll display as

295
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:42,950
you'd expect so doing two at the same

296
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:44,960
time you know essentially it uses a

297
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:47,180
separate separate streams a list to

298
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:49,880
display it the final thing you notice

299
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:51,560
there is i'm not using any concept of

300
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:55,010
the width to display or sorry the width

301
00:13:55,010 --> 00:13:56,180
and the height that's passed through as

302
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:58,250
part of the pointer event to display a

303
00:13:58,250 --> 00:13:59,900
different width and height to the line

304
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:04,010
and we can do that with event dot with

305
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:07,070
an event height and essentially use that

306
00:14:07,070 --> 00:14:09,650
to drive the width that we're using for

307
00:14:09,650 --> 00:14:13,730
the the line that's displayed and and

308
00:14:13,730 --> 00:14:17,660
and if we do that that's hard to do with

309
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:21,020
my finger we get slightly bigger wets

310
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:22,580
and why it works better if it's on the

311
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:24,950
actual screen but what you'll see is

312
00:14:24,950 --> 00:14:26,540
it'll it'll depend on if you're using

313
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:28,340
your you're with a higher quality

314
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:31,040
digitizer you'll see that if that

315
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,960
increases and decreases you by two with

316
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:36,140
your your finger so that's that's a

317
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:44,520
brief example of how you use it natively

318
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:46,400
just want to talk a little bit how you

319
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:49,400
get started so i eat n has vendor prefix

320
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,620
support for this this is in without

321
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:55,490
vendor prefixes in I 11-hour open tech

322
00:14:55,490 --> 00:14:57,590
teams open tech inside Microsoft as a

323
00:14:57,590 --> 00:14:59,210
team of folks that contribute to open

324
00:14:59,210 --> 00:15:01,310
source projects and they've done a

325
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:04,040
WebKit prototype of this it's available

326
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:07,820
here I believe they've also have

327
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:09,860
announced an intent to implement for the

328
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:12,630
blink project as well

329
00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:15,600
as a formal implementation but if you

330
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,890
really want to get started today there's

331
00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:18,470
a couple of polyfills that are available

332
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:22,530
hand j s was developed by a person at

333
00:15:22,530 --> 00:15:25,650
microsoft and then there's also points j

334
00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:28,580
s which is developed by richard harris

335
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:31,610
so that's kind of a quick overview of

336
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:36,780
pointer events i am around the rest of

337
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:37,680
the day if you have any more questions

338
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:46,500
but thank you

339
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:48,190
I already see a question in the audience

340
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:55,330
so let's kick this off here hey um to

341
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:57,790
kind of stress what Dominic Nicola told

342
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:00,730
about told us about forcing vendors to

343
00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:03,340
expose richer functionality pointer

344
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:05,070
events are great in the sense of

345
00:16:05,070 --> 00:16:07,810
obstructing my mouse and touch events

346
00:16:07,810 --> 00:16:09,760
uh-huh what about gestures is there

347
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,560
anything sure there is there's not

348
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:13,540
anything I really encourage people look

349
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:15,340
to that spac there's not anything in

350
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:16,720
this specification about gestures

351
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:19,240
themselves it's just as this event model

352
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:22,270
but it does make a ton of sense to start

353
00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:24,070
building on top of that for which is I

354
00:16:24,070 --> 00:16:26,740
think most gestures are becoming kind of

355
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:29,530
popular exactly so yeah I makes total

356
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:33,400
sense yeah thanks yeah other questions

357
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:41,850
okay went over there

358
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:45,140
one question about interpreted movements

359
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:47,300
of like where you have a free assumption

360
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:48,950
of what the user wants to achieve like a

361
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:51,560
scroll which is essentially a touch on

362
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:54,589
mobile devices yep is anything in this

363
00:16:54,589 --> 00:16:56,450
back there that makes that easier if you

364
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:58,339
want to do like headers that like

365
00:16:58,339 --> 00:17:00,560
retract or something no there's nothing

366
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,149
