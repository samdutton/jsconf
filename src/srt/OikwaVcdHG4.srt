1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:09,860

I never heard so much enthusiasm for it

2
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:13,610
so here we go

3
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:17,220
so as Paris said in Thank You Paris

4
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:19,830
my name is Jeremy Wagner I am a web

5
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:22,439
performance consultant and a sort of

6
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:25,769
general web tinkerer and I'd love to

7
00:00:25,769 --> 00:00:27,300
thank the organizers for such a great

8
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:29,789
opportunity and for you for your

9
00:00:29,789 --> 00:00:30,840
willingness to come to a talk called

10
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:33,239
make it boring at a JavaScript

11
00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:36,870
conference so okay turn on presenter

12
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:40,800
remote I'm an adult okay so this talk is

13
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,360
the live version of an opinion piece

14
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:43,800
that I wrote earlier this year by the

15
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,500
same name so if you've read that post

16
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,059
you probably already know what you're

17
00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:50,850
getting into and before warned there's

18
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:54,140
not much actual code in this talk so

19
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:56,940
like the post it's based on it's kind of

20
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:58,469
this melange of thoughts and

21
00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:00,090
philosophies and opinions so if you're

22
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:02,940
like as they close the doors if you are

23
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:04,500
like you know I really kind of just want

24
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:07,740
to like maybe see something Cody the HP

25
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:09,659
track has an awesome talk by Simeon on

26
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:13,200
on Chrome extensions but if you're here

27
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,330
cool I won't be offended but thank you

28
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:17,400
for chilling out any in any case I hope

29
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:21,540
you like it okay so I think we have a

30
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:23,810
little echo on this mic okay I

31
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:25,950
originally wanted to open this talk with

32
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:28,229
a boring story or anecdote but that

33
00:01:28,229 --> 00:01:31,860
would be boring so instead I'll kick

34
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:34,320
things off and talk about an exciting

35
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,259
thing and how that exciting thing ended

36
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:39,210
up being so risky and destructive that

37
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:41,400
it wiped out trillions of dollars of

38
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:44,369
wealth most of you probably remember the

39
00:01:44,369 --> 00:01:46,619
subprime mortgage crisis which played

40
00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:51,390
out between 2007 and 2008 before I

41
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:52,860
continue I'd like to assure you that

42
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:54,630
this is a talk about web development not

43
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:59,340
finance the subprime mortgage crisis was

44
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:01,259
an entirely avoidable economic

45
00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:02,909
catastrophe that began with the creation

46
00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:06,270
of the mortgage-backed security exciting

47
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:08,550
right the mortgage-backed security is a

48
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:10,200
financial product backed by home

49
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,090
mortgages it was created long before the

50
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:13,300
crisis ever occurred

51
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:14,950
and a big chunk of home loans get

52
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:16,630
bundled up into this product which

53
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:19,060
investment banks then offer to investors

54
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:21,790
it's generally considered a very safe

55
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:24,010
investment most people don't default on

56
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:26,290
their loans this limits the risk

57
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:29,020
so while returns are relatively modest

58
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:32,440
they're dependable seems pretty boring

59
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:35,320
so far right here's where it gets

60
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:38,370
exciting when Congress deregulated

61
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:41,320
Investment Banking in the 90s investment

62
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:44,530
banks got all ginned up the lack of

63
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:46,420
proper regulations allowed banks to

64
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:48,460
offer high-risk subprime mortgage loans

65
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:50,380
and sometimes even these disgusting

66
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:53,500
interest-only loans and then on the

67
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,840
investment side came credit default

68
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,030
swaps where investors could bet against

69
00:02:58,030 --> 00:02:59,920
the US housing market effectively

70
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,590
rooting for and ultimately profiting

71
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:05,310
from the downfall of the US economy and

72
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:09,400
that's exactly what happened as the Fed

73
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,080
raised interest rates in an attempt to

74
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,120
cool things down

75
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,800
adjustable rate subprime loans adjusted

76
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,720
accordingly which spurred defaults on a

77
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:21,130
massive scale and then markets tanked

78
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:24,160
taking the economy with them all because

79
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,920
investing wasn't risky or exciting

80
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:31,720
enough already this is a perfect example

81
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,430
to me of when boring would have been

82
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:34,600
preferable to exciting

83
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:37,930
if markets and banks had been properly

84
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:39,700
regulated and yielded boringly

85
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:41,709
predictable returns things would be

86
00:03:41,709 --> 00:03:43,450
different today people would have been

87
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:45,010
set who were set to retire would have

88
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:46,570
been able to at that time instead of

89
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:49,330
having to rebuild their portfolios some

90
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:50,800
people would have been able to keep

91
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,530
their homes and just as an aside and

92
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:56,050
it's a total aside this is why ethics

93
00:03:56,050 --> 00:03:58,690
and regulations are critical because

94
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:00,700
just because you can fleece someone for

95
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:02,080
everything they've got doesn't mean you

96
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,470
should if it sounds like I'm drawing a

97
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:07,660
parallel between the state of modern

98
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:10,030
development and this kind of crisis it's

99
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:12,550
because I am but I acknowledge that we

100
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:14,709
are not hurtling toward a comparable

101
00:04:14,709 --> 00:04:16,989
crisis with even remotely similar

102
00:04:16,989 --> 00:04:19,840
consequences but we are headed towards

103
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:22,570
something and the trend doesn't look so

104
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:24,700
great and part of the reason why this

105
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:26,800
trend persists at least I believe is

106
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,879
because we're not operating with

107
00:04:27,879 --> 00:04:31,000
sensible defaults and more and more web

108
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,800
development has become more like

109
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,720
software engineering in some respects I

110
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,550
believe this is a welcome in logical

111
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:39,849
progression but I do sometimes wonder in

112
00:04:39,849 --> 00:04:42,460
the dead of night if we're ready for all

113
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:44,280
the responsibilities that that entails

114
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,780
because rather than evaluating each

115
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:48,580
individual projects requirements and

116
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:51,250
adapting our choice of tools to them we

117
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:53,289
tend to dive into right into what makes

118
00:04:53,289 --> 00:04:55,990
development exciting and fun for us so

119
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:57,550
to that end what do we do when we start

120
00:04:57,550 --> 00:05:01,180
a new project we npm install a preferred

121
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:04,930
framework and then we might install a

122
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:06,819
client-side router for that framework

123
00:05:06,819 --> 00:05:10,270
and then maybe even a state management

124
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:14,110
library for the framework of course and

125
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:16,780
before you know it a project has started

126
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:18,909
with an amount of overhead that's baked

127
00:05:18,909 --> 00:05:21,219
in until you decide to migrate away from

128
00:05:21,219 --> 00:05:25,060
it somehow your preference for what

129
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:26,710
makes development more exciting or

130
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:29,139
perhaps I should say more convenient or

131
00:05:29,139 --> 00:05:31,360
comfortable has forced you to make

132
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,039
trade-offs that could make your apps

133
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:37,889
lower less accessible and less usable

134
00:05:37,889 --> 00:05:39,909
when it comes to software development

135
00:05:39,909 --> 00:05:41,560
there's a word that I think is really

136
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,949
important and that word is constraints

137
00:05:43,949 --> 00:05:46,180
think of your favorite video games from

138
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:48,490
your childhood most Super Nintendo games

139
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:50,590
of the time could fit on a 1 megabyte

140
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:52,419
cartridge sometimes even in a quarter of

141
00:05:52,419 --> 00:05:55,240
that size this point has been done to

142
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,190
death I know but it endures because it

143
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,930
demonstrates how much can be done with

144
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:02,860
so very little yet I don't think it

145
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:04,690
fully acknowledges that the constraints

146
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:06,699
game developers faced at the time we're

147
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:10,449
far more fixed than ours are now so when

148
00:06:10,449 --> 00:06:12,490
developers make console games they knew

149
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:14,080
every consumer had the same hardware

150
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,969
those were the constraints and they were

151
00:06:15,969 --> 00:06:19,779
very predictable our constraints however

152
00:06:19,779 --> 00:06:22,930
make our job uniquely difficult people

153
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:24,460
access the web on a variety of devices

154
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:26,949
with wide ranging capabilities such as

155
00:06:26,949 --> 00:06:29,680
this affordable but slow moto G for

156
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,500
Android phone and this is to say nothing

157
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,509
of the varying quality of the networks

158
00:06:34,509 --> 00:06:36,930
these devices access the web through

159
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:39,370
this is a reality which requires us to

160
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:40,540
make architectural choice

161
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:42,880
is that our best for people because

162
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,680
while our tools are convenient and they

163
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,360
help us to be productive they do

164
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:49,600
sometimes confer an external cost on

165
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,160
users that we must acknowledge and

166
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:54,910
redress in some capacity this is

167
00:06:54,910 --> 00:06:57,220
relevant because for example here in the

168
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:58,810
US while many people live in large

169
00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:00,400
cities which are typically well served

170
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,500
by fast broadband and mobile internet

171
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,360
connections there are gaps even

172
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,970
sometimes chasms in this coverage that

173
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:10,030
we must be mindful of this 2016 article

174
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:12,040
by the MIT Technology Review revealed

175
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,810
that 58% of the households in the

176
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:15,580
cleveland metro area with yearly income

177
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:19,240
under $20,000 had no broadband internet

178
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:21,550
access these are people who rely on

179
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:23,860
mobile internet connections often with

180
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:26,490
data caps and overages to access the web

181
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:29,800
internet access is not a luxury it's a

182
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:32,830
right and more striking as this passage

183
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:34,300
in which Pew Research found that

184
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:36,880
one-third of Americans don't have an

185
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,020
internet connection in their homes

186
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:41,710
faster than dial-up I sincerely doubt

187
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:44,380
this is significantly improved since the

188
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:47,050
article was written the economic and

189
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:49,210
infrastructural challenges have not been

190
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:50,860
sufficiently addressed to broaden

191
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:54,070
broadband access in these areas and to

192
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:56,650
me this is a compelling reason to make

193
00:07:56,650 --> 00:08:00,420
things boring again I can empathize with

194
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:02,710
wanting to make web development exciting

195
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:05,320
it's a big reason why I started doing

196
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:07,360
this stuff in the first place and when I

197
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:12,040
started I wanted to do everything my

198
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,600
first experience with making webpages

199
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,580
was in a WYSIWYG editor in middle school

200
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:18,490
and once I hit the limits of what that

201
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:20,650
thing could do I had a novel thought

202
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:24,010
which was hey the hell happens when I

203
00:08:24,010 --> 00:08:26,140
opened this here index dot HTM in a

204
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:29,740
notepad that thought clearly changed my

205
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:31,660
life for the better I think it's fair to

206
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:32,979
say that I wouldn't be standing here in

207
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:35,800
the stage if I hadn't done that everyone

208
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,419
in our industry has an origin story and

209
00:08:37,419 --> 00:08:39,010
for many of us that story begins with

210
00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:41,770
the making of the fanpage for whatever

211
00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:43,920
thing we were obsessed with at the time

212
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:47,470
and for me that obsession was fixed on

213
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:49,390
the just fixed on the popular

214
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:50,980
first-person shooters of the day like

215
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:54,200
doom and hexan and quake and the ops

216
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,690
itself was irrelevant but but it gave me

217
00:08:56,690 --> 00:08:58,790
an excuse to propel myself down a path

218
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:00,830
of relentless and sometimes reckless

219
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:03,050
experimentation I wanted to do

220
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:05,960
everything everything I mean everything

221
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,580
I wanted to put every last bit of new

222
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:09,110
knowledge I quite I acquired about

223
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:11,510
making webpages to work right away and

224
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:13,970
in the most glaringly obnoxious way

225
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:19,430
possible apparently yeah that's that's

226
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:22,670
mine don't go look for it and in my

227
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:24,770
fervor I was inspired to make countless

228
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:27,400
garish sites with horrid color schemes

229
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:30,710
crappy animated gifs guest books that no

230
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:34,040
one ever signed what web rings that no

231
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:37,910
one ever joined and then there was flash

232
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:43,250
Oh flash three iterations of my personal

233
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:44,960
website were crappy to advanced

234
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,970
knockoffs where cosmetics and flashy

235
00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:49,820
animations won out over literally any

236
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:52,820
kind of sensibility and like anyone my

237
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:54,650
inspiration was just a conduit through

238
00:09:54,650 --> 00:09:56,900
which I developed my skillset but what I

239
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:58,490
didn't develop for the longest time was

240
00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:01,100
discipline I didn't understand basic

241
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,840
design principles accessibility

242
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,880
performance user experience or literally

243
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,650
anything that would help me to make

244
00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:09,290
websites anyone would want to use and

245
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:12,110
that's not to say that my excitement for

246
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:13,610
the medium or our excitement for the

247
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:16,070
medium is ill motivated I was just

248
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:18,110
inexperienced but the work that we're

249
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:20,510
paid to do requires us to build boringly

250
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:23,690
useable things sometimes that work is

251
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:25,580
the equivalent of creating digital push

252
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:28,310
brooms they're ordinary as hell but yes

253
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:29,690
there are also tools that help people

254
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:32,510
accomplish tasks online banking job

255
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:34,610
applications buying essentials for the

256
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:36,110
home you name it

257
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:39,140
when our excitement for building for the

258
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:40,700
web is coupled with our thirst for

259
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:43,130
pushing it to do more all the time we

260
00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:45,530
can inadvertently build heavy unusable

261
00:10:45,530 --> 00:10:47,690
things that can hinder rather than

262
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:50,030
enable people to complete the tasks our

263
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:53,450
work enables them to achieve and so to

264
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:55,550
that end many new developers these days

265
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:57,320
aren't entering the industry with a

266
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,030
decade of learning and experimentation

267
00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:00,680
under their belts or even a four-year

268
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:03,550
degree boot camps are a big thing

269
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:06,230
they're people who are both new to and

270
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:08,060
really excited about building

271
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:10,040
stuff for the web and making a living

272
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:13,010
from that work and we need these people

273
00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:15,140
among us they're going to be the next

274
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:16,580
generation of developers that brings

275
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:18,710
renewed fervor to this industry and I

276
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:22,010
can't wait to see what they do but this

277
00:11:22,010 --> 00:11:23,660
isn't an experience that I can speak to

278
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:26,150
as my path was so radically different I

279
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:28,220
didn't join a web developer boot camp

280
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:29,990
and make a living off of my skills

281
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:33,350
within a year I had ten years of

282
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:35,570
unfettered experimentation before I

283
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:37,730
could make anything that anyone would

284
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:40,910
want to use or consider usable it takes

285
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:42,830
time and continuing education to develop

286
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:46,400
these sensibilities and because

287
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,020
employers favor skill sets that

288
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:50,120
prioritize the fastest way of building

289
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:52,460
applications that means they're going to

290
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:54,440
hire people who know today's frameworks

291
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:57,200
and so the fastest way to start getting

292
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,700
paid after you graduate from boot camp

293
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:01,520
is to apply for jobs that match the

294
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,170
framework based skills they taught you

295
00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:04,510
in boot camp

296
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:07,790
thus hiring in the industry has become

297
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:10,070
an Ouroboros where employers want

298
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:11,750
applicants with framework specifics

299
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:14,810
centered skillsets and consequently

300
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:16,580
developers learn those frameworks to get

301
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:18,710
gigs because hiring managers want to

302
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:21,050
tick off the boxes and get devs to ship

303
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:24,530
code fast and often and so in this

304
00:12:24,530 --> 00:12:26,510
seemingly infinite loop frameworks

305
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:28,040
become the scaffolding upon which we

306
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:30,680
build our careers this isn't the worst

307
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:32,900
thing that can happen framework and

308
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:35,030
library specific knowledge can propel

309
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:37,550
you to learn their underpinnings I would

310
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:39,320
never would have went as deeply into

311
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:41,060
JavaScript as I have if not for the

312
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:43,250
awesomeness that was jQuery in the late

313
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:46,280
2000s but I believe that a sole reliance

314
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:48,650
on these abstractions can eventually

315
00:12:48,650 --> 00:12:50,690
become a limiting factor in your

316
00:12:50,690 --> 00:12:53,450
long-term growth and unless your

317
00:12:53,450 --> 00:12:55,370
curriculum sufficiently covers the

318
00:12:55,370 --> 00:12:57,260
fundamentals or you've had to learn them

319
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:59,540
on your own you'll always be reliant on

320
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:01,810
the abstractions to do the work

321
00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:03,950
front-end development has been this way

322
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:06,770
for about a decade more so read the

323
00:13:06,770 --> 00:13:08,270
resume of any veteran front-end

324
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:10,760
developer and you'll quickly see that it

325
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:12,890
resembles like a geologic column of

326
00:13:12,890 --> 00:13:16,670
different skills this industry has

327
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:19,520
always chased what's so hot right now

328
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:21,860
and we're set up from day one of our

329
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:24,860
careers to feed into that arguably the

330
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:26,120
worst part of this is that our

331
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:29,360
continuing education in HTML CSS and

332
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:32,000
platform API is gets relegated to some

333
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,690
day or worse after hours where you have

334
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:37,399
to sacrifice some amount of work-life

335
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:40,519
balance just to keep up and by the way

336
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:42,589
not everyone has the time to devote in

337
00:13:42,589 --> 00:13:44,630
their off hours to do that work they

338
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:46,279
have families they have responsibilities

339
00:13:46,279 --> 00:13:48,320
in my opinion we shouldn't compel them

340
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,870
to but rather enable them to explore and

341
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:54,290
learn on the job and all of this is

342
00:13:54,290 --> 00:13:56,180
ostensibly done in the name of

343
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:58,510
productivity sometimes at our own peril

344
00:13:58,510 --> 00:14:01,370
this constant churn as Rachel Andrew

345
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:03,560
suggests in this very brilliant post I

346
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:06,110
suggest you read has us bound to a cycle

347
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:07,760
of never-ending site rebuilds and

348
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,500
framework migrations that can seem

349
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:12,740
counterproductive in hindsight and so

350
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:15,290
without careful consideration for which

351
00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:17,180
abstractions are truly beneficial for

352
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:19,250
the purpose you're trying to serve being

353
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:21,740
lashed to this wheel becomes a brutal

354
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:23,420
affair where progress becomes difficult

355
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:26,440
to sustain over the long term

356
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:29,810
whether it was jQuery then or react now

357
00:14:29,810 --> 00:14:32,089
these tools are designed to make us more

358
00:14:32,089 --> 00:14:37,670
productive and they do blood if we were

359
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:40,459
pressed to admit it this constant churn

360
00:14:40,459 --> 00:14:42,170
is at least in part due to our desire to

361
00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:44,000
make our work more fun and exciting and

362
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,190
it's something I like to call laptop

363
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:48,440
sticker culture something will can't see

364
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:50,120
it from here but something I'm clearly

365
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:52,699
guilty of where everything we do

366
00:14:52,699 --> 00:14:55,550
outwardly appears badass or glamorous

367
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:57,260
and if I didn't know any better I'd

368
00:14:57,260 --> 00:15:02,360
swear some of us are on tour it's also

369
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:06,250
why even in the year of our Lord 2019

370
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:09,019
you still see job postings every so

371
00:15:09,019 --> 00:15:11,540
often with with these superlatives like

372
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:15,290
rock star guru or ninja like am I

373
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:17,000
supposed to pack some shuriken z' with

374
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,649
my laptop like but hey hey why shouldn't

375
00:15:21,649 --> 00:15:23,390
our work be more fun and exciting a lot

376
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:25,360
of career fields are boring Drudge work

377
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,050
shouldn't be shouldn't it be more

378
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:32,270
exciting right we're all propelled by

379
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:33,590
our interests

380
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:35,660
and for you that interest could be

381
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:38,120
JavaScript and friends could be HTML

382
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:40,700
could be CSS or it could be the various

383
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:42,890
abstractions of these technologies but

384
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:45,110
if you could for a second put aside your

385
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:47,330
interests and ask yourself what what's

386
00:15:47,330 --> 00:15:49,580
the purpose you're trying to serve when

387
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:50,930
you build something for the web

388
00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:52,220
what are you helping people to

389
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:55,220
accomplish the varying answers we give

390
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:57,170
to that question should form a curve

391
00:15:57,170 --> 00:15:59,000
around which we adjust our philosophy

392
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,150
for how we build for the web because if

393
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:03,560
you're in charge of any remotely

394
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:05,870
critical resource on the web your desire

395
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:08,060
for a rich developer experience simply

396
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:11,540
must take a backseat to the task people

397
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:13,160
depend on the web for more than just

398
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:17,450
buying the web is a portal for many

399
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:19,580
critical resources stuff like job

400
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:22,190
applications public assistance crisis

401
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:24,410
intervention and other services we tend

402
00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:26,890
not to think about until we need them

403
00:16:26,890 --> 00:16:31,690
ours is a job done by people for people

404
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:34,070
plumbers might get excited about PEX

405
00:16:34,070 --> 00:16:36,440
piping but they also understand that

406
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,030
their job is to ensure that the water

407
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:39,950
gets from the main to the faucet the

408
00:16:39,950 --> 00:16:41,260
same as before

409
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:44,030
PEX pipe confers a material improvement

410
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:46,339
for both installers and end-users

411
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:49,640
without hampering functionality can we

412
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:51,470
consistently say the same thing about

413
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:54,460
all the conveniences that we rely on

414
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:57,380
data flows through pipes of sorts but

415
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:59,330
the environmental constraints imposed on

416
00:16:59,330 --> 00:17:00,950
us by the network and the devices people

417
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:03,350
use demand our most careful

418
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:06,020
consideration factors like network

419
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:08,079
bandwidth and latency are quite evident

420
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:11,060
but others such as server protocol or

421
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:12,620
device capabilities are a little more

422
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:15,290
subtle and then there's the person

423
00:17:15,290 --> 00:17:17,900
holding the phone or tablet or sitting

424
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:20,329
behind a laptop each of which is an

425
00:17:20,329 --> 00:17:22,370
individual case study of capabilities

426
00:17:22,370 --> 00:17:23,929
and limitations that demand our

427
00:17:23,929 --> 00:17:27,530
attention and so knowing this I think

428
00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:29,420
it's important we avoid one assumption

429
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:31,220
like the plague which is that our

430
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:33,920
conveniences always confer equal

431
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:37,310
benefits for users your enthusiasm for

432
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:39,590
virtual Dom frameworks probably doesn't

433
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:41,090
benefit someone who's been thrown out of

434
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:43,400
their home by an abusive partner when

435
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,640
they turn to the web to find shelter

436
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,630
someone trying to find public

437
00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:49,820
assistance information or apply for a

438
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:52,310
job on spotty Wi-Fi isn't helped by your

439
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:56,480
client-side router somewhat arts are

440
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,220
conveniences have a time in a place and

441
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:01,310
that time is not always every time nor

442
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:04,700
is that place always everywhere and I'm

443
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:07,100
not shaming anyone here for their choice

444
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:11,030
of tools I use I use tools I love them

445
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:13,490
but to stress that simply using them

446
00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:15,320
won't do the difficult work of design

447
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:18,710
and user experience for you and so as

448
00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:22,040
developers our ethical Duty isn't

449
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,630
limited to identifying and removing

450
00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:26,000
excesses in code we also need to

451
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,770
challenge excesses which may look nice

452
00:18:27,770 --> 00:18:29,690
and design comps but only serve to

453
00:18:29,690 --> 00:18:32,660
frustrate people in practice excesses in

454
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:34,700
design and development are necessarily

455
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:37,520
intertwined every interaction you can

456
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:40,180
simplify every boondoggle you can remove

457
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:43,820
represents a benefit for the end-user so

458
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:50,000
let's make it boring the web is

459
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,230
frustrating when it creates obstacles

460
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:54,950
for people an obtrusiveness in websites

461
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:56,900
are the result of every project manager

462
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:59,900
designer and developer unwilling or most

463
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:01,370
of the time unable to question

464
00:19:01,370 --> 00:19:03,590
ill-conceived business requirements

465
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:05,300
design decisions or architectural

466
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:07,610
decisions or architectural choices it's

467
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:10,820
on all of us and josh clark wrote an

468
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:12,380
article about design systems a while

469
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:14,240
back and what struck me was his emphasis

470
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,940
on the role of boring in UX I'd be lying

471
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:20,000
if if I said I wasn't inspired by you

472
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,320
know this talk wasn't inspired by this a

473
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:23,540
little bit he discussed how when he

474
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:24,980
helped his clients to create design

475
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:27,200
systems he stressed the importance of

476
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,560
simplicity and I quote the more common

477
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:33,260
the problem the better design systems

478
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:36,290
should prioritize the mundane and in a

479
00:19:36,290 --> 00:19:37,970
world where everyone feels like they

480
00:19:37,970 --> 00:19:40,580
just want to disrupt without it

481
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:42,440
considering the consequences this is

482
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:44,690
sage advice and for me it's a kind of

483
00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:47,540
revitalizing tonic avoiding

484
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:49,490
obtrusiveness in design is the very soul

485
00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:51,700
of designs that work best for people

486
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:54,080
without acknowledging that we can only

487
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,600
create fast accessible and usable

488
00:19:56,600 --> 00:20:01,159
websites entirely by accident a perfect

489
00:20:01,159 --> 00:20:02,809
ample of obtrusive design was a

490
00:20:02,809 --> 00:20:04,309
little-known visualization project

491
00:20:04,309 --> 00:20:06,229
developed by Apple's research division

492
00:20:06,229 --> 00:20:09,200
called hot sauce which was an attempt at

493
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:12,549
visualizing site maps for websites

494
00:20:12,549 --> 00:20:15,289
instead of presenting this data in a

495
00:20:15,289 --> 00:20:17,299
very straightforward way it was

496
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:20,570
presented as a 3d spatial field to its

497
00:20:20,570 --> 00:20:22,639
credit hot sauce was a novel

498
00:20:22,639 --> 00:20:25,159
presentation of this data it was neat it

499
00:20:25,159 --> 00:20:27,799
was a fun experiment but no one wanted

500
00:20:27,799 --> 00:20:29,419
to browse a spatial rendering of a

501
00:20:29,419 --> 00:20:31,190
website's hierarchy as if they were on

502
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:35,149
the holodeck they wanted a boringly

503
00:20:35,149 --> 00:20:37,429
predictable and utilitarian way to

504
00:20:37,429 --> 00:20:40,429
access that information an unordered

505
00:20:40,429 --> 00:20:45,169
list may be examples of obtrusive design

506
00:20:45,169 --> 00:20:46,789
as they exist on the web are a little

507
00:20:46,789 --> 00:20:47,299
different

508
00:20:47,299 --> 00:20:50,090
I don't know about you I don't even like

509
00:20:50,090 --> 00:20:52,849
one hamburger menu let alone three of

510
00:20:52,849 --> 00:20:57,799
them it's not excitement that produces

511
00:20:57,799 --> 00:20:59,779
patterns like this I don't think maybe I

512
00:20:59,779 --> 00:21:01,099
god I hope not

513
00:21:01,099 --> 00:21:03,440
but a sort of unwillingness or inability

514
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,929
to address the unsustainable growth of

515
00:21:05,929 --> 00:21:09,200
an application over time eminently

516
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,179
usable designs and architectures result

517
00:21:11,179 --> 00:21:13,909
when simplicity is the default it's one

518
00:21:13,909 --> 00:21:16,999
of the iron laws it's why unstyled HTML

519
00:21:16,999 --> 00:21:19,519
just works it so beautifully solves the

520
00:21:19,519 --> 00:21:21,259
problem of presenting documents to the

521
00:21:21,259 --> 00:21:23,690
screen that we don't consider all of the

522
00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:25,609
careful thought that went into its jaw

523
00:21:25,609 --> 00:21:29,330
achingly boring presentation now I'm not

524
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:33,739
holding a torch aloft and in marshalling

525
00:21:33,739 --> 00:21:35,440
the Village People and demand that we

526
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,249
transport ourselves back to the

527
00:21:37,249 --> 00:21:39,739
aesthetics of 1994 that would just

528
00:21:39,739 --> 00:21:42,109
that's absurd and it's antithetical to

529
00:21:42,109 --> 00:21:44,869
the spirit of progress but I do think

530
00:21:44,869 --> 00:21:46,609
that this ideal is something that we can

531
00:21:46,609 --> 00:21:49,220
carry on in our daily work especially

532
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:51,590
when more websites are consumed as web

533
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:54,830
apps we can make apps more resilient by

534
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:57,139
adhering to semantics platform solutions

535
00:21:57,139 --> 00:22:00,289
and progressive enhancement and as it

536
00:22:00,289 --> 00:22:02,269
stands we're accustomed to serving heaps

537
00:22:02,269 --> 00:22:04,489
of div burgers on silver platters of

538
00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:06,559
JavaScript that not everyone can access

539
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:08,710
in all the places they may need to

540
00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:11,089
accessibility advocates aren't lecturing

541
00:22:11,089 --> 00:22:13,639
you and screaming at you to use semantic

542
00:22:13,639 --> 00:22:14,960
HTML because it's Joe

543
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:19,399
like so much fun you'll pass out but

544
00:22:19,399 --> 00:22:21,020
because it's well understood how people

545
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:23,360
benefit from it the built-in

546
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:24,440
functionality you get from those

547
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:26,059
semantics allows you to travel lighter

548
00:22:26,059 --> 00:22:27,980
as you won't need to build or install

549
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:30,590
accessible alternatives does this mean

550
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:31,940
your choice of tools are in direct

551
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:33,919
opposition to the goal of creating good

552
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:37,850
user experiences and depends depends on

553
00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:40,490
how you use those tools it at least

554
00:22:40,490 --> 00:22:41,960
requires us to understand the trade-offs

555
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:44,270
we might be making if we choose to use

556
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:48,230
them so we need to bifurcate our focus

557
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:50,179
on what we learn we should learn

558
00:22:50,179 --> 00:22:53,000
frameworks and abstractions yes but we

559
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,710
also need to learn the platform api's

560
00:22:54,710 --> 00:22:56,360
that server that serve as their

561
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:58,760
foundation so that we can adapt more

562
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:02,330
nimbly as the wind shifts the long-term

563
00:23:02,330 --> 00:23:05,029
health of the web cannot be sustained if

564
00:23:05,029 --> 00:23:06,830
we ignore what the web platform brings

565
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:08,390
to the table solely for our own

566
00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:11,809
convenience and underscoring the

567
00:23:11,809 --> 00:23:14,840
importance of those fundamentals is the

568
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:16,909
fact that we're wired to want things to

569
00:23:16,909 --> 00:23:18,649
be boringly predictable

570
00:23:18,649 --> 00:23:22,419
we not only want it we expect it and

571
00:23:22,419 --> 00:23:27,169
subconsciously demand it so when things

572
00:23:27,169 --> 00:23:29,600
are predictable they embody the expected

573
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:32,480
qualities of the essential we don't want

574
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,340
any surprises with the planes landing

575
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:35,990
gear as we come in for a landing

576
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:38,890
that is not excitement I can get behind

577
00:23:38,890 --> 00:23:41,840
this is an example of a critical fixture

578
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:44,299
and some of what we preside over as

579
00:23:44,299 --> 00:23:46,820
developers are also critical fixtures of

580
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:50,360
a sort these fixtures especially need to

581
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:52,460
remain fast and accessible part of

582
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:54,260
getting there necessarily involves

583
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:57,500
relying more on HTML CSS and platform

584
00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:01,429
api's to reduce overhead and if your

585
00:24:01,429 --> 00:24:03,440
reaction to what I'm saying is to assert

586
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,899
that this is boring work that will

587
00:24:05,899 --> 00:24:08,510
create boring websites that users will

588
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:11,570
find boring then I must viciously retort

589
00:24:11,570 --> 00:24:13,700
with the emergence of reader mode

590
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:15,320
features that exist in several browsers

591
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:19,429
at its core reader mode is just a boring

592
00:24:19,429 --> 00:24:21,679
mode toggle that strips away scripts and

593
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:23,870
styles to distill a page down to its

594
00:24:23,870 --> 00:24:28,370
core content people are so tired of

595
00:24:28,370 --> 00:24:28,840
grass

596
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:30,669
playing with stuttering script Laden

597
00:24:30,669 --> 00:24:33,250
pages that they'll gladly strip away

598
00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:34,779
everything exciting to get to that

599
00:24:34,779 --> 00:24:37,289
crucial nugget of content more easily

600
00:24:37,289 --> 00:24:40,809
still reader mode won't work everywhere

601
00:24:40,809 --> 00:24:43,870
and we shouldn't expect it to its

602
00:24:43,870 --> 00:24:45,880
intended application for is for written

603
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:47,500
content like articles not rich

604
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:50,409
applications solving human problems does

605
00:24:50,409 --> 00:24:53,500
require a human touch after all and so

606
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:56,679
to that end we are wired as human beings

607
00:24:56,679 --> 00:24:59,679
to want external consistency which is

608
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:01,029
when an object's function and

609
00:25:01,029 --> 00:25:03,399
recognizable appearance is reinforced by

610
00:25:03,399 --> 00:25:05,409
other similar implementations in the

611
00:25:05,409 --> 00:25:08,620
environment imagine a house with zero

612
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:11,200
external consistency we're turning on

613
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,970
turning the knob on the stove changes

614
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:15,159
the television channel or flipping the

615
00:25:15,159 --> 00:25:16,630
lights which flushes the toilet

616
00:25:16,630 --> 00:25:19,000
and as Eric Bailey notes in an article

617
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,159
on a list apart and I highly recommend

618
00:25:21,159 --> 00:25:22,779
you read this and follow him he is an

619
00:25:22,779 --> 00:25:24,789
excellent person in the accessibility

620
00:25:24,789 --> 00:25:27,549
field browsers themselves are flush with

621
00:25:27,549 --> 00:25:29,950
examples of external consistency and we

622
00:25:29,950 --> 00:25:31,659
would do well to ensure that we don't

623
00:25:31,659 --> 00:25:33,490
break those externally consistent

624
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:38,529
behaviors now I am fully aware of the

625
00:25:38,529 --> 00:25:40,120
danger of saying this on stage at a

626
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:42,789
JavaScript conference so hold your

627
00:25:42,789 --> 00:25:46,419
tomatoes for a second but one of the

628
00:25:46,419 --> 00:25:48,130
most common subversions of external

629
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:50,169
consistency in browsers is the single

630
00:25:50,169 --> 00:25:54,490
page application or s.p.a my personal

631
00:25:54,490 --> 00:25:56,289
inclination is to avoid building sites

632
00:25:56,289 --> 00:25:58,840
as SBA's this isn't because I hate them

633
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:01,630
or I don't understand how they work or I

634
00:26:01,630 --> 00:26:03,640
think they're filthy filthy dirty awful

635
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:07,390
things it's just that the behavior they

636
00:26:07,390 --> 00:26:09,580
replace is one that browsers already do

637
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:12,640
very well when we decide to take on the

638
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:15,789
task of implementing that ourselves we

639
00:26:15,789 --> 00:26:17,340
are taking on a lot of unnecessary

640
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:20,039
responsibilities and risks in many cases

641
00:26:20,039 --> 00:26:22,630
how browsers navigate from page to page

642
00:26:22,630 --> 00:26:26,230
is part of a specification arrive to

643
00:26:26,230 --> 00:26:28,510
after a deliberative process of debate

644
00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:30,760
and consensus and continual improvement

645
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:34,360
and in my opinion it takes a whole lot

646
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:36,909
of courage with just a dash of hubris to

647
00:26:36,909 --> 00:26:38,200
assume we can do this better than

648
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:41,760
browsers have done in 25 or so years

649
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,890
and when a client-side router is used

650
00:26:43,890 --> 00:26:46,230
accessibility can become a casualty in

651
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:48,090
that effort there's a whole host of

652
00:26:48,090 --> 00:26:49,980
things we end up reinventing or miss

653
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:52,830
altogether or shift beneath us as things

654
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:55,590
change history must be managed tabindex

655
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:57,360
and scrolling position must be accounted

656
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,730
for navigation cancelling can fail and

657
00:26:59,730 --> 00:27:03,600
so on even if we get client-side routing

658
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:06,930
just perfect there's another problem we

659
00:27:06,930 --> 00:27:10,140
have to grapple with which is when we

660
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:12,210
neglect to send server generated markup

661
00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:13,800
in favor of rendering everything on the

662
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,990
client an app's contents are not only

663
00:27:15,990 --> 00:27:19,160
inaccessible if and when when by the way

664
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:21,720
JavaScript fails but loading performance

665
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:26,070
suffers as well when we serve content

666
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:27,660
from the server sure we lose that

667
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:29,910
snappiness after the initial load I will

668
00:27:29,910 --> 00:27:32,940
concede that gladly but we retain that

669
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:35,280
external consistency that people respect

670
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:38,790
or expect sorry that's not to say that

671
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:41,160
we can never use client-side routers if

672
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:43,290
you provide server-side versions of all

673
00:27:43,290 --> 00:27:45,360
your client-side routes people will have

674
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:48,030
a way to access your site from literally

675
00:27:48,030 --> 00:27:50,670
any context whether it's a link from the

676
00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:54,630
outside or an internal link and then if

677
00:27:54,630 --> 00:27:56,220
components are attached to server side

678
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:57,900
markup through client side hydration

679
00:27:57,900 --> 00:28:00,210
people are going to get a progressively

680
00:28:00,210 --> 00:28:02,460
enhanced experience that gives us

681
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:04,140
freedom a lot of freedom to try

682
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:05,490
different things perhaps only the

683
00:28:05,490 --> 00:28:07,470
authenticated part of your app as an SP

684
00:28:07,470 --> 00:28:10,260
a or and I like this and I've been

685
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:11,370
experimenting with it a little

686
00:28:11,370 --> 00:28:13,110
perhaps client-side routing could be

687
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:16,140
opted into as an app setting ensuring it

688
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:18,570
only happens if people want it to where

689
00:28:18,570 --> 00:28:22,740
we make no assumptions which brings me

690
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:26,810
to my final point and the end of my talk

691
00:28:26,810 --> 00:28:31,530
no tool or any amount of automation will

692
00:28:31,530 --> 00:28:33,780
ever be a perfect substitute for a

693
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:35,940
human's judgement which is a which is

694
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:37,800
finely honed over years of experience

695
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:42,060
solving human problems and solving human

696
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:44,970
problems necessarily requires that you

697
00:28:44,970 --> 00:28:46,620
accept that humans have limitations

698
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:50,700
either inherent or imposed it also

699
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:52,380
requires you to accept that the tools

700
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:55,180
you use can fail you in some ways

701
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:57,070
and your judgment is necessary in those

702
00:28:57,070 --> 00:29:00,220
situations now let me tell you another

703
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:01,170
story

704
00:29:01,170 --> 00:29:05,320
this is stanislav petrov he was a

705
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:06,970
lieutenant colonel in the soviet air

706
00:29:06,970 --> 00:29:09,040
forces during a dangerously tense period

707
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:12,790
of the Cold War while he was on duty in

708
00:29:12,790 --> 00:29:15,520
1983 a brand-new Soviet missile

709
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,740
detection system reported that five

710
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:19,510
nuclear missiles were launched by the

711
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:21,900
United States and on the way to Russia

712
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:24,700
through a reason and no small amount of

713
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:27,010
intuition he was convinced that the

714
00:29:27,010 --> 00:29:30,340
system was wrong in the moment he

715
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:31,690
concluded that five missiles was

716
00:29:31,690 --> 00:29:34,090
illogical because the us strike would

717
00:29:34,090 --> 00:29:37,420
have been all-out so he did not inform

718
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:38,890
his superiors and therefore a

719
00:29:38,890 --> 00:29:41,550
retaliatory strike was never authorized

720
00:29:41,550 --> 00:29:44,890
he turned out to be right the system was

721
00:29:44,890 --> 00:29:45,340
wrong

722
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:47,830
turned out to be sunlight reflecting on

723
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:50,740
some clouds of both North Dakota that

724
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:54,220
triggered the false positive so while

725
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:55,660
we'll never know all the factors at play

726
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:57,550
of the various levels of command in this

727
00:29:57,550 --> 00:30:00,730
situation it is not unreasonable to

728
00:30:00,730 --> 00:30:02,620
speculate that his decision to

729
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:04,240
disbelieve the tools at his disposal

730
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:07,180
when the time came for it may have

731
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:11,010
averted a global nuclear war obviously

732
00:30:11,010 --> 00:30:13,420
no JavaScript engine here in this room

733
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:14,770
will ever be charged with such a

734
00:30:14,770 --> 00:30:17,410
perilous decision I hope not let's hope

735
00:30:17,410 --> 00:30:19,210
that javascript isn't the mechanism on

736
00:30:19,210 --> 00:30:25,600
which that operates but I think it is a

737
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,040
great lesson about how the tools we

738
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:30,340
depend on can still get things wrong if

739
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:32,110
that was if that wasn't the case every

740
00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:34,140
github issues page would be a ghost town

741
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:38,560
zero issues zero pr's a million stars

742
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:44,020
for everyone yay so it is on us to

743
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:45,730
realize and own up to our responsibility

744
00:30:45,730 --> 00:30:48,220
to people as well as how our preferences

745
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:50,080
as developers and the needs of real

746
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:52,360
people can intersect in a way that's

747
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:55,120
mutually beneficial and knowing where

748
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:57,280
that intersection lies involves

749
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:59,260
realizing that while an accessibility

750
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:01,510
inspector can tell you what semantic

751
00:31:01,510 --> 00:31:03,850
elements you should use knowing why

752
00:31:03,850 --> 00:31:05,860
those elements are preferable to a div

753
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:08,000
soup is just as vital

754
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,529
it's also realizing that y-you could

755
00:31:10,529 --> 00:31:12,929
install a layout framework such problems

756
00:31:12,929 --> 00:31:15,029
are best solved by relatively new and

757
00:31:15,029 --> 00:31:17,340
widely supported CSS layout modes such

758
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:18,890
as flexbox and grid

759
00:31:18,890 --> 00:31:22,320
in fact if you want to create layouts

760
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:23,700
that catch the eye and push the

761
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:25,770
boundaries beyond the ordinary you need

762
00:31:25,770 --> 00:31:27,570
to rely on these new layout modes

763
00:31:27,570 --> 00:31:30,059
you can't keep kicking that bootstrap

764
00:31:30,059 --> 00:31:33,000
can down the road people because not

765
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,890
only is the overhead of bootstrap

766
00:31:34,890 --> 00:31:36,750
ownerís it's just not where the web is

767
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:39,149
is destined to go nor will it allow you

768
00:31:39,149 --> 00:31:41,100
access to the full power of these new

769
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:43,620
layout modes there are people called UI

770
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:48,299
engineers hire them for all of my

771
00:31:48,299 --> 00:31:50,190
whinging about the evils of JavaScript

772
00:31:50,190 --> 00:31:52,409
and all the simple excitement it and its

773
00:31:52,409 --> 00:31:54,450
framework brethren brain I firmly

774
00:31:54,450 --> 00:31:56,520
believe it has its place this is not a

775
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:58,260
diatribe against JavaScript

776
00:31:58,260 --> 00:32:01,080
I believe javascript is great it's given

777
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:03,120
a lot of us a living and I'm thankful

778
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:06,480
for that but we do need to rebalance our

779
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:08,039
use of it against other parts of the web

780
00:32:08,039 --> 00:32:11,520
platform javascript is most resilient

781
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,809
when we can use it with progressive

782
00:32:12,809 --> 00:32:15,630
enhancement in mind that's to say when

783
00:32:15,630 --> 00:32:17,549
we can build a baseline everyone

784
00:32:17,549 --> 00:32:20,250
benefits from and then add that

785
00:32:20,250 --> 00:32:22,440
candy-coating to enhance usability

786
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,210
further for those who can benefit from

787
00:32:24,210 --> 00:32:26,399
it we're not just building better user

788
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:29,720
experiences but more inclusive ones and

789
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:33,059
that to me is the really good work

790
00:32:33,059 --> 00:32:35,580
that's worth doing because inclusivity

791
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:37,350
is not something we should just make

792
00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:39,720
room for at conferences it needs to be a

793
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:43,649
part of our daily work if you care about

794
00:32:43,649 --> 00:32:46,260
the web as I know you all do because if

795
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:48,990
you're here you definitely care you'll

796
00:32:48,990 --> 00:32:50,429
come to find out that this approach to

797
00:32:50,429 --> 00:32:52,500
our work isn't boring at all but really

798
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:55,590
quite rewarding we have two objectives

799
00:32:55,590 --> 00:32:58,740
as developers one work to make things

800
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:00,539
better this week than they were last

801
00:33:00,539 --> 00:33:04,500
week and to continue our education to

802
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:05,730
ensure the success of the first

803
00:33:05,730 --> 00:33:10,200
objective I genuinely truly believe our

804
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:13,230
work can never be boring so long as it

805
00:33:13,230 --> 00:33:15,510
helps us deliver on these objectives in

806
00:33:15,510 --> 00:33:18,240
the spirit of making the web faster more

807
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:21,210
accessible and therefore more usable

808
00:33:21,210 --> 00:33:25,290
for everyone every where thank you

809
00:33:25,290 --> 00:33:31,370
[Applause]
