[Music]

2
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:16,800
do one more why not hi papoom I'm gonna

3
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,930
talk about CSS pranks J's Kampf I know

4
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:21,810
but CSS pranks you used to I don't even

5
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:22,859
know if I'll need the whole five minutes

6
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:25,500
here they used to be a really cool way

7
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:26,699
that you could do this in Chrome there

8
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:28,650
was a file called custom CSS and if you

9
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:31,380
open that file and you put CSS in it it

10
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:33,030
would apply that CSS to every single

11
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:35,160
website that this person went to which

12
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,480
was an awesome way to just kind of mess

13
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,430
with them and mangle with them but that

14
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:41,579
was eventually deprecated but you can

15
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:43,320
now pretty much build a small extension

16
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:45,539
add to CSS into it install the extension

17
00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:46,950
on anybody who's really kind of

18
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:48,690
unsuspecting and if they've just left

19
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:50,129
that computer open you can kind of do

20
00:00:50,129 --> 00:00:52,829
that it used to be funnier because in

21
00:00:52,829 --> 00:00:54,390
custom CSS it would apply to all the

22
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:56,760
settings and everything like that in the

23
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:57,870
browser so sometimes it was really

24
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:00,840
confusing to kind of turn things off but

25
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,340
yeah so once you kind of enter this

26
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:03,840
point where you can enter CSS into

27
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,280
anybody's page you can really start to

28
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,740
kind of mess with some people so here's

29
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:09,840
a really really simple example if you

30
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,060
put grayscale 100% on everything

31
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:13,979
everybody's websites are gonna be black

32
00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:16,140
and white and it's just every single

33
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:18,090
thing you're looking at Google Images

34
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:19,290
anything like that it's black and white

35
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:21,270
and the key I think to messing with

36
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:25,830
people is subtle fuckery rather than

37
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:30,030
full-blown unusable 'ti if you rotate

38
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:32,880
the page just by a tiny tiny amount it's

39
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,350
gonna look normal at the start this is

40
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:35,759
my old website but as they start to

41
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:37,829
scroll down it's gonna start to get

42
00:01:37,829 --> 00:01:39,900
weirder and weirder where here's my my

43
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:44,159
current website for example you can do

44
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:45,420
that to every single website that

45
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:47,759
somebody visits and they're just I guess

46
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:49,049
you just gotta kind of start to tilt

47
00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:52,140
your head something like that this is

48
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:54,119
another kind of funny one is it's kind

49
00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:56,100
of trying to take advantage of class

50
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:57,630
names that are used by a lot of websites

51
00:01:57,630 --> 00:01:59,939
so here's a keyframe animation that will

52
00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:03,869
that will spin something if you apply

53
00:02:03,869 --> 00:02:06,630
that to the class logo the ID logo logo

54
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:09,000
images logo image

55
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,070
every site is not gonna start to have a

56
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:13,020
logo that kind of spins around here's

57
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:13,680
code pen

58
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,870
yeah there's Google if you do this to

59
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:18,960
somebody again it doesn't really give

60
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,670
them enough reason to think what's going

61
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:23,640
on here I need to fix this so just say

62
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:26,490
have you notice the logo of spinning on

63
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:29,700
a lot of websites it's just a trend just

64
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:33,630
a design trend yeah you can change every

65
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:36,480
every link make it hot pink there's

66
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,220
there's TweetDeck another one odds for

67
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:41,209
breast cancer who doesn't even yeah

68
00:02:41,209 --> 00:02:44,070
there we go this is this is something

69
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:45,540
that you can do that's kind of really

70
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:48,300
messing is make a keyframe animation

71
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:51,780
that rotates the hue of things so when

72
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:54,600
you do that this is just an image you

73
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,100
can kind of start to see that it really

74
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:58,770
slowly changes in tones and that'll be

75
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:01,290
every women on every website that these

76
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:02,820
people go to and if you really want to

77
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:05,070
mess with them cleverly you make it over

78
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:07,590
a minute long the animation so it's just

79
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:10,860
really not something they kind of notice

80
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:13,200
but you you can tell it really messes

81
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,019
with their braids just make every

82
00:03:16,019 --> 00:03:18,330
transition really really slow on every

83
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:20,400
page make it important if they're doing

84
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,900
any animations everything that's going

85
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:24,510
to run for three seconds and then you

86
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:26,250
can mess with just like obnoxious just

87
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:29,610
CSS that I kind of showed in my talk you

88
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:31,350
can just have all their fonts kind of go

89
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:32,850
crazy but you will actually send

90
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:34,260
somebody insane by doing that that's all

91
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:35,680
I have to say thank you
