community leased by the people right so

provide to the community a good time at

10
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,960
our meetups is to find people to who are

11
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,690
willing to stay here and talk to the

12
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:49,950
others and they have usually all the all

13
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:51,570
