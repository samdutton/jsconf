00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:22,040
good afternoon talking a little css grids for those who do not know 

2
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:28,590
is a new layout is a new way to organize the page is something that

3
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:33,780
It is still quite green but you will see that it has a potential

4
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:39,780
huge and it's good I am fascinated by the truth it's very very good

5
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:46,519
start first ariel I'm an energy developer I'm

6
00:00:46,519 --> 00:00:49,780
working almost five years ago

7
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:55,730
I went through quite a few companies before that

8
00:00:55,810 --> 00:01:00,880
this go through many of the things that all of us went through at the time of

9
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:07,060
fight with the code this work with flash as many of you will have

10
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:13,480
also worked this pass through the tables as many others will also have

11
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:21,370
past and then good came the new way to build dips sites with

12
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:28,350
css this which makes things a little easier for us and now something better is coming the future

13
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:32,619
I hope this is the future because the truth is that it is very good that

14
00:01:32,619 --> 00:01:35,940
are the villas

15
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:43,560
so as we make a grid let's think about it first we can say it is

16
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:49,380
a new way that allows us to define a structure where we have rows and

17
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:55,620
columns this item or we can choose what to put in each column in each row of

18
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:58,970
a very easy way now let's see

19
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:06,509
We have a normal grid, as many people will have experienced something as simple as that.

20
00:02:06,509 --> 00:02:12,620
that we can hang this in many ways we can this

21
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:18,230
grab a match rubbing binds them left to right clicker

22
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:24,560
of the putter and well this is going to work like everywhere now you grid what

23
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:30,030
proposes is to think this differently we have several basic concepts that there are

24
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:34,460
to understand before starting to regret a little in the css

25
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:39,350
one of them is grit lines chris lines can or what we can see

26
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:43,540
exactly what are all the red lines marked

27
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:49,079
which are basically what makes up the grid are horizontal or vertical

28
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,600
on the other hand at we are seeing the numbered ones

29
00:02:55,600 --> 00:03:03,540
there are six lines for the rows subject and four lines for the columns

30
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:08,840
on the other hand we have a grid track that would be the area between two

31
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:14,840
lines between two grid lines in this case there is this creature that contains the

32
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:17,980
content ya la side

33
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:23,060
grisel which is a unit the smallest unit that we can find within

34
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:28,610
the grids which is exactly all content that has that is between 4

35
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:30,970
games

36
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:37,770
and yell since it's basically the same thing as a network track only it can

37
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:41,310
contain several grip cels in this case we are talking about yelling and footer

38
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:43,890
now we will see later why

39
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:48,240
this this looks very closely related to a concept that we are going to see a

40
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,720
a little later

41
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:56,790
as we define a grid well following the example above in this

42
00:03:56,790 --> 00:04:01,230
case we have 44 dips sandro a container

43
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:07,620
and we define for contaminating a new type of display that describes this what

44
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:12,690
going to do is all the direct children of that container will be

45
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:19,109
trying as a grid so far we have nothing we have the definition and the

46
00:04:19,109 --> 00:04:23,190
elements are not yet positioned in that grid because we have to

47
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:29,199
say by css so here we have a couple of concepts

48
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:32,520
let's see if i can

49
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:39,110
in addition to display grid we have two properties

50
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:44,450
with template rose and template columns this is what we are going to say is the

51
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:48,890
definition of how many columns and how many rows will I have and what

52
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:54,200
size in this case what I'm defining for example is

53
00:04:54,200 --> 00:05:01,790
the first road is going to be 200 pixels later it is going to have another 35 pixels another one of

54
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:09,380
420 another of 35 and finally one of 200 and for the columns there will be three

55
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:17,210
columns about 740 135 and another of 185 after there are basic properties

56
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:22,820
I'm basically centering the container at a width of 960 and

57
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:27,860
basic style properties for elements for the children of that

58
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:32,950
container something important we can use flex inside

59
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:36,280
of those containers this just using them to center

60
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:41,240
the elements on both the x-axis and the axis

61
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:45,990
we do see this we have the same values ​​that we define

62
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:54,629
in the css a column of 740 another of 35 that would be this space between the

63
00:05:54,629 --> 00:06:03,020
content of the output and another of 800 185 the same for rows 235 420 35 and 200

64
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:12,600
we identify each grid with a number as we see here each greenline

65
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:15,710
why do we do this

66
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:20,990
that number will tell us where we want to position each element

67
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:24,690
we have these four properties that we will now see can be written

68
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:30,300
another way in principle we have scream to start grip volume scream rose start and

69
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:32,130
darling and basically robben what we're telling you

70
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:35,960
is i want you to start on the grid on line 1

71
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:41,060
as for the column and you end up at 4 I want it to start at row 1 and

72
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:47,770
i ended up in row 2 the same for the other elements in all defined

73
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:51,600
and if we see this example

74
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:56,750
huge

75
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:10,710
a company

76
00:07:19,849 --> 00:07:22,539
very difficult

77
00:07:40,889 --> 00:07:43,819
and complicated

78
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:47,880
I think I'm going to have to change the resolution

79
00:07:51,289 --> 00:07:53,860
lets try

80
00:07:57,529 --> 00:08:01,749
a moment things that happen

81
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:11,020
I don't know that he doesn't want to work

82
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:18,560
okay

83
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:24,240
to do something I'm going to do something very easy is

84
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:33,590
I have problems with the resolution

85
00:08:35,099 --> 00:08:37,849
if you let me down

86
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:46,830
i'm going to change the resolution very easily that's the power

87
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:59,829
this time the display is perfect

88
00:09:13,769 --> 00:09:16,459
is

89
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:27,560
and it's better

90
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:39,379
well I don't know if you see a lot but I hope much less you see

91
00:09:39,379 --> 00:09:41,889
East

92
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:49,890
well we are

93
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:58,990
well after a little trying what good we have then

94
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:03,889
and as you can see the definitions and we have our

95
00:10:03,889 --> 00:10:07,809
our perfectly armed shore

96
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:10,550
now

97
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:16,340
this same this same syntax we can write it also

98
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:21,330
we can say directly written alum and grid road where the first value is

99
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:25,980
the grid what would be the scream like and in the second value that would be the

100
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:31,820
I scream lumen and the same for each other

101
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:35,740
we separated them by a with a flash from Navarra

102
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:40,870
and it's a little bit easier way let's say we describe the same thing we can

103
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:46,179
do something else even a little bit more which for me is more complicated in

104
00:10:46,179 --> 00:10:49,449
actually i would use this in general but hey you can directly define a

105
00:10:49,449 --> 00:10:54,369
crit area where the syntax is grid rose start virtual long start grid

106
00:10:54,369 --> 00:10:58,209
robben grip volume I really like more

107
00:10:58,209 --> 00:11:01,509
this way because it seems a bit more understandable to me but hey this is another

108
00:11:01,509 --> 00:11:06,980
way to define where our content goes

109
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:12,079
well so far what we saw is a grid in which we specify

110
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:16,610
Let's say the gap that would be the margin between each of the

111
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:21,440
elements and we had to specify it directly here in the grid row and the

112
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:28,670
cry of the 35 pixels refer to these 35 pixels and these 35 pixels thing

113
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:33,440
it's not that good because the truth could be better we could mean

114
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:40,220
Well, I have this gap and I just want to have the columns in this account

115
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:44,680
actual and actual rows without having to specify that margin good luckily

116
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:50,200
my life to the rescue but it's a Greek property in this

117
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:55,150
case this value is taking the 35 pixels for both the road and the

118
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:59,949
column but we could basically change it and

119
00:11:59,949 --> 00:12:04,959
put a different gap for columns than for rows but this allows us

120
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:10,959
simplify this whole system a little bit and then now it's much more readable

121
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:16,810
we have three rows and two columns and we specify the gap with this

122
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:19,110
property

123
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:23,050
therefore our graph would be a little more simplified we would have to

124
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:27,940
basically tell that the second wickline would be this is

125
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:33,130
like the gap we are putting it directly the css

126
00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:38,770
then we would have nothing more than 4 grit lines for those for the rows and 3 for

127
00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:41,280
the columns

128
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:48,720
therefore our being is also changing a little bit but this basically

129
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,160
the same looks the same way

130
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:57,029
we may also like to use the word funk this will ring a bell if you ever

131
00:12:57,029 --> 00:13:03,100
they will work with tables with span rose pan well this this syntax the levels

132
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:08,440
we are saying is I want you to start in column 1 and expand it over

133
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:14,709
the second is also the same as putting 1/3 is another way to describe it

134
00:13:14,709 --> 00:13:20,170
in this case the future and the header as both are being exposed to more than

135
00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:24,209
a column carry this key

136
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:29,760
I can also name each of those

137
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:34,180
and lines are set to 5 chetes it would be like

138
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:36,690
a parameter

139
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:46,080
this would be the name of the first of the first row has 200 pixels the name

140
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:53,280
of the second 420 the name the third and we give the final name to the row what

141
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:55,910
same for columns

142
00:13:56,819 --> 00:14:02,129
then also in the css we can directly specify that name of

143
00:14:02,129 --> 00:14:06,299
line instead of having to explain numerically

144
00:14:06,299 --> 00:14:10,470
each of the rules and this added up is pretty good because it allows you

145
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:13,889
remember a little more you don't have to be fixing you what is the line that in

146
00:14:13,889 --> 00:14:16,709
the one that I had to add well with these fairly descriptive names

147
00:14:16,709 --> 00:14:21,089
we can specify in the same way and this code is going to

148
00:14:21,089 --> 00:14:25,169
always be the same anyway you see this and it will continue to be exactly

149
00:14:25,169 --> 00:14:27,829
same as it was before

150
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:32,370
missing the fruit that is a little wrong I think I missed

151
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:37,670
so have you put the align justify well

152
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:46,300
we can also do this specify the same name the same here for

153
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:51,180
columns and for the rows they all share the same let's say the

154
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:53,389
same

155
00:14:54,110 --> 00:15:01,020
and what we specify directly is that name and the line number

156
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:05,970
then you can tell that ingrid row by

157
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:11,550
example I the only thing that is said specify is road because

158
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:16,240
if we go to the example again

159
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:26,510
in this case rose 1 start says that we are talking about the header is

160
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:33,279
saying I want it to start on the first line no I didn't have to specify

161
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:39,670
the second line because the algorithm understands that once you specify

162
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:44,350
the start is going to go yes or yes to the second line unless you

163
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:47,769
we specify that it goes further so in this case

164
00:15:47,769 --> 00:15:53,470
we had to specify it but if not the soul understands in all cases with the

165
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:58,480
columns is just like it was going to take up to the up to the next line not what

166
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:03,389
we can specify nothing more with the first with the first call and nothing more

167
00:16:10,089 --> 00:16:15,220
until now we have been seeing examples of an explicit grid in the

168
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:20,250
that we define in the css the size that the

169
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:26,550
columns and of the rows that happens if we add more elements have tips

170
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:32,150
extra added how are you going to see those tips good

171
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:35,020
let's see the example

172
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:41,580
I added 4 extra dips with more content

173
00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:50,590
the grid algorithm what it does is it's going to try

174
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:57,400
apply the same the same definitions that we told ourselves in the

175
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:03,510
container to the other elements so how do you know they are two columns

176
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:10,450
I directly positioned them in the two columns and if I keep adding two I will

177
00:17:10,450 --> 00:17:13,870
going to keep adding in the same way that's because the algorithm is

178
00:17:13,870 --> 00:17:19,300
smart and knowing how to position the elements even when they are out of

179
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:24,430
explicit grid this would be just then we talk about and implicit which is

180
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:30,780
the grid outside the definition that we gave the css

181
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:46,010
now we have two more properties that we can

182
00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:51,230
use that are grid auto rose and auto columns this property is what I

183
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:56,060
allow is to specify to the implicit grid what value I will have in

184
00:17:56,060 --> 00:18:02,150
As for height, you have already used those new elements that are in the grid

185
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:06,680
implicit then in this case I'm telling you that all my rows that you create

186
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:12,020
that you think are outside that explicit grid have a value of 500

187
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:15,320
pixels and that all my columns have a value of 200 pixels

188
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:20,090
then it exists we see it is the same example

189
00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:28,820
so our content has 500 pixels

190
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:34,870
and 200 pixels as we said here we can easily change this

191
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:45,320
and now our content has 100 because they are presented the same for

192
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:47,590
columns

193
00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:55,620
We can also do something very interesting that esther bits are

194
00:18:55,620 --> 00:19:00,960
which are grids inside the grid in this example that if you remove

195
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:06,620
inside maine which is our main content we have 3 sub contents

196
00:19:07,630 --> 00:19:10,590
pretty simple

197
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:18,180
to those who in that same container I defined as a condition that will be

198
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:20,880
grid then all the elements are inside they will also be gray

199
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:25,290
ians in this case add a 10 pixel padding to separate it a little bit

200
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:31,920
of its container and a gray gap of 10 pixels for both columns and

201
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:35,980
rows and here we are introducing a new

202
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:42,370
concept that is this of fr that would be a fraction that is a fraction

203
00:19:42,370 --> 00:19:47,260
I am saying that my columns are occupied

204
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:53,650
a fraction so there are two fractions of the fraction would be

205
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:59,680
the white space I have left in the container then I say I want you to

206
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:03,749
there are two blanks and this will calculate me

207
00:20:03,749 --> 00:20:08,610
automatically if we see it

208
00:20:11,650 --> 00:20:16,390
we have 3

209
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:22,480
let's see the properties so we understand how it is positioned by its

210
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:27,940
content 1 I said I want column 1 to go 3

211
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:33,539
that's why the funk is done until the end and in the others I put them both the

212
00:20:33,539 --> 00:20:39,350
arrow 21 in the first or second column

213
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:45,399
the good thing about fraction is that it is an automatic calculation that is

214
00:20:45,399 --> 00:20:52,059
pretty good pretty efficient and allows us to make laws the way

215
00:20:52,059 --> 00:20:57,990
that we want this is very powerful so we will continue

216
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:02,480
another important concept which is I love the truth

217
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:07,970
are called yelling jazz is another way to define a grid we have this

218
00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:12,950
grid template property arias that what we can do is define as a

219
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:17,420
sort of graphic representation we would have to do of how it is going to be

220
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:23,390
our grid so if you see it here we would have two columns the

221
00:21:23,390 --> 00:21:29,159
first column has the header that is both in the first and the

222
00:21:29,159 --> 00:21:33,809
second later in the left column we would have the content of the

223
00:21:33,809 --> 00:21:38,490
across the side and the future also behaves like heather up to 100%

224
00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:42,229
of the screen as we define then where each

225
00:21:42,229 --> 00:21:46,450
good element we have this area grid property

226
00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:51,100
basically I tell the header to put it in header

227
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:57,450
at least because they are not happy and the same for more

228
00:21:57,500 --> 00:22:01,880
We see this and it will be exactly the same as the previous example, another way to

229
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:07,049
define a villa exactly the same

230
00:22:07,049 --> 00:22:11,759
allows us to do things like it's not designed says the future in the end

231
00:22:11,759 --> 00:22:17,030
we want it up and the axis of work lay down of the designers

232
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:21,470
well we do like this

233
00:22:22,890 --> 00:22:27,270
we have football upstairs beautiful and the one I work and it's that easy to change

234
00:22:27,270 --> 00:22:32,550
let's say this is so simple it allows us to do really cool things now

235
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:36,260
we will see another type of positioning

236
00:22:38,119 --> 00:22:44,449
we can also define where the content goes according to its name now

237
00:22:44,449 --> 00:22:46,809
we'll see

238
00:22:47,430 --> 00:22:52,130
like we came here

239
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:57,670
we can use these kits that we define in complete ideas

240
00:22:57,670 --> 00:23:00,910
when we select where we want our elements to go now we are going to

241
00:23:00,910 --> 00:23:03,030
see

242
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:08,680
for example we have a law that we want to put on that grid that is on the outside

243
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:14,380
of anything else I say aside well I tell you know I want you to be in

244
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:19,830
the column where the content begins this is the quiz script start and script in

245
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:25,060
it would be to put me where is the content where do you think content and this

246
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:28,720
it is here that we define in grit temple tasks then I want this double and

247
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:32,680
this where content starts where the content ends and in the rows

248
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:35,779
I want it to be where heather starts and where he doesn't watch the content

249
00:23:35,779 --> 00:23:38,469
if we see it

250
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:46,570
but it is a law that just begins in the header and ends in the

251
00:23:46,570 --> 00:23:50,590
content against the rows and starts where the content begins in the

252
00:23:50,590 --> 00:23:54,850
columns and ends the content that we define this we can

253
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:58,049
quietly change too

254
00:24:04,149 --> 00:24:08,500
well i still want it to go into the future

255
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:13,210
and it goes to the future or anything we could well this

256
00:24:13,210 --> 00:24:15,960
from the example of fasting

257
00:24:33,539 --> 00:24:39,269
we can put what we want let's say answer with we have power to

258
00:24:39,269 --> 00:24:43,919
whatever is possible and it's that easy we have to change the structure of the

259
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:48,479
free we are put it any anywhere total the css takes care

260
00:24:48,479 --> 00:24:52,400
of all support

261
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:58,330
and we are this yesterday's description is complicated

262
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:02,470
there's a lot of red out there surprisingly internet explorer

263
00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:07,030
supports it quite well which is a surprise for me for all the only thing

264
00:25:07,030 --> 00:25:10,700
bad is that it has a slightly different syntax than what we are seeing now

265
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:15,350
in chrome and firefox this is actually red but good because it is supported

266
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:19,790
we have to enable it with a flyer to show how safari also

267
00:25:19,790 --> 00:25:23,300
support well well we're still screwed this is a pretty aspect

268
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:27,740
fairly new that is still changing then well let's have

269
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:31,430
We have to adapt and wait a bit, but at some point we will be able to

270
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:37,880
use it as it is but as we inhabit it from firefox

271
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:45,070
well you don't see anything but we have to work in order and although I don't read anything

272
00:25:45,070 --> 00:25:47,990
I think it is law to point c that is the gray point

273
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:53,610
and level and we have to do it between for chrome with flags

274
00:25:53,610 --> 00:25:58,080
and we have to enable you to experiment it was captured by features because all

275
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:02,490
examples if they don't all look the same you don't see anything at all but well we can

276
00:26:02,490 --> 00:26:07,520
and start using it to try things out if you want to do it

277
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:12,230
it's pretty good well this was all pretty examples

278
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:20,269
singles of what is gray gray with a fairly normal and expected law but what

279
00:26:20,269 --> 00:26:24,929
happens with the real world well I found this site that I found

280
00:26:24,929 --> 00:26:32,070
good enough to be able to enable it with grids because it has enough of the

281
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:37,880
things that we could recreate in this way if we see it

282
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:46,010
this is the stop site

283
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:49,440
simple

284
00:26:50,230 --> 00:26:53,250
and if we see it on mobile

285
00:26:57,059 --> 00:27:02,659
normal single column items to 100%

286
00:27:02,659 --> 00:27:10,000
well I said well we could see how to recreate this in grids well

287
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,980
this is the sketch that tells me we can define on the one hand the grid lines

288
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:23,310
we have these three now I am going to tell you why in this example I don't use grid apps

289
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:29,610
and that is why we have a 28 pixel one above and another

290
00:27:29,610 --> 00:27:34,850
18 pixels here this is something that is not contemplated in the green rose that

291
00:27:34,850 --> 00:27:41,280
I proposed it in fact they did not give me a ball but to be able to specify different

292
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:45,639
grit rose grit rose gaps with a different gaps

293
00:27:45,639 --> 00:27:50,630
pixel sizes in this case I had to do it because they were different

294
00:27:50,630 --> 00:27:56,240
or put them both at 28 at 18 pixel speed the old way we saw

295
00:27:56,240 --> 00:28:03,570
previously contained and the last green line

296
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:11,390
and at stop here we do have a gap of 50 pixels

297
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:17,510
they are oops the 50 pixels both for the columns compare the rose then

298
00:28:17,510 --> 00:28:22,220
we can use grid up and we have the gdr the banner

299
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:26,559
content left and content right

300
00:28:28,090 --> 00:28:31,770
let's see a little how is this

301
00:28:34,429 --> 00:28:39,649
this is the hug the truth yes quite ugly because we are in this but let's say

302
00:28:39,649 --> 00:28:44,860
that this is the last example I don't know if

303
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:54,630
let's look

304
00:29:06,410 --> 00:29:13,190
well then there we define imagine this on mobile because this would be read

305
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:18,370
for mobile we define a container that is grid

306
00:29:18,370 --> 00:29:25,490
we follow our rows and columns there is the auto value that explains to us that

307
00:29:25,490 --> 00:29:31,280
it would be good to explain what it is basically we define a row in the

308
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:34,340
we don't know how much the content is going to be, so we say

309
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:40,100
auto that contained the height of the development height is going to be the height of your

310
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:43,310
content after we have 28 grid pixels that

311
00:29:43,310 --> 00:29:48,670
up to this gap is another car that would be all of

312
00:29:48,670 --> 00:29:55,200
the articles with the articles 18 gap pixels and another car to make

313
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:58,220
a short list of articles

314
00:30:00,130 --> 00:30:05,380
I also tell you that the columns - 100% therefore takes me 100% of the

315
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:07,710
screen

316
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:13,289
and then basically what I did is position each element of the container

317
00:30:13,289 --> 00:30:18,399
that would be this red they were going to the container both are in the one of chris

318
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:23,140
lowe one as we said this we can also ignore it

319
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:25,920
and it will look the same

320
00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:35,970
and then we have the content that is on road 3 and ends on 4

321
00:30:36,350 --> 00:30:40,160
and the content 2 that is in the network 5 and also 6 a little bit of an English father

322
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:45,030
that he had and nothing else we already have the half armed

323
00:30:45,030 --> 00:30:52,520
for when we want to see the layout of this

324
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:21,159
if we see this example

325
00:31:23,410 --> 00:31:28,830
we have the is quite similar to what the live site is

326
00:31:29,110 --> 00:31:33,750
we are in mobile we go to the mean and stop

327
00:31:34,450 --> 00:31:40,000
we define a max wheat and center it at 1,064 which gives the size that it was set

328
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:47,230
in the real site and we define on the one hand the rows that are going to be automatic in

329
00:31:47,230 --> 00:31:52,540
both cases the two rows because because our content we do not know if it will

330
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:55,690
having more than one item can have one can have four by having twenty

331
00:31:55,690 --> 00:32:00,260
so we want it to be automatic where we define a fixed height

332
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:04,640
and we can also define in this case how we saw the columns in

333
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:09,020
percentages we have 40 percent for the first column and 60% for the

334
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:13,410
second we position the elements

335
00:32:13,410 --> 00:32:19,160
and we have something more interesting in the content

336
00:32:26,450 --> 00:32:32,960
content 1 and content are néstor grids each of them

337
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:39,610
therefore all your children are going to be bought like grids

338
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:49,200
In the case of the content in stop, what we define is a gap of 10 pixels

339
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:52,220
that we love each other here

340
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:56,320
we took out the father in which we had a dance and we put the columns

341
00:32:56,320 --> 00:33:02,650
they are we have them at 50% each one therefore this one looks like this we could

342
00:33:02,650 --> 00:33:08,220
change it calmly we could put 30 and 70 so if

343
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:10,370
we make

344
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:17,150
and we would have a little bit different data if we wanted to do it

345
00:33:17,150 --> 00:33:22,230
so well this is a real example of how we could implement it in the

346
00:33:22,230 --> 00:33:25,090
moment there is support we are still

347
00:33:25,090 --> 00:33:28,690
we are difficult in this matter but well I wanted to give you an explanation

348
00:33:28,690 --> 00:33:33,310
pretty quick how it works it seems to me it's it's something that has a lot

349
00:33:33,310 --> 00:33:39,490
potential and in a few years when it is really alive and can be used we will

350
00:33:39,490 --> 00:33:44,740
solve life a little bit everyone you can download this talk by miguel

351
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:50,350
house also pdf and all the examples we saw are in me

352
00:33:50,350 --> 00:33:55,860
I for unha if they also want to follow me on twitter sometimes I write things
