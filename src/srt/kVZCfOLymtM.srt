[Music]

2
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:14,940
my name is Deanna and I want to talk

3
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:17,400
today about Hell meant to tell and

4
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,550
whatnot but I will not tell you

5
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:22,710
something that you don't know already

6
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:25,880
but I just wanted to more share my story

7
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:32,820
because I figure maybe if I share my

8
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:35,010
story maybe I can help somebody before

9
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:38,989
they come to the point that I was so I

10
00:00:38,989 --> 00:00:41,700
wanted to speak mostly about health

11
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:44,309
because about two years ago I started to

12
00:00:44,309 --> 00:00:48,570
have pain in my arm and I ignore it for

13
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:53,239
like about a year and then a year after

14
00:00:53,239 --> 00:00:55,949
suddenly like there were like days that

15
00:00:55,949 --> 00:00:58,829
I have this freakin pain in my arm even

16
00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:00,930
when I was in coding like over the

17
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:02,789
weekend doing other stuff and I was like

18
00:01:02,789 --> 00:01:05,400
what's wrong what I guess I never even

19
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,710
heard from other people or even myself

20
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:10,710
even when I work in the industry now

21
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:14,220
almost for 10 years never read so much

22
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:17,310
about it now and I went to a doctor on a

23
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:19,080
Saturday to the emergency because it was

24
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,600
really terrible and then they told me I

25
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,909
think you have to donate is probably you

26
00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:27,869
need to go on Monday - I know specialist

27
00:01:27,869 --> 00:01:33,659
just to give you the accurate analysis

28
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:35,610
of that but the doctor in the emergency

29
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:37,799
room told me that then I wonder and they

30
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:38,759
told me yes

31
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:42,030
you actually have tennis elbow

32
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:45,090
I believe it's calling Yurman and then

33
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:47,130
they told me I was in a point where they

34
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:48,630
told me you need to take a break at

35
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:52,140
least for a month and do Frankham

36
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:54,840
gymnastic which is the therapy and

37
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:59,009
massage for the arm and I did that and I

38
00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:03,329
remember I was very shocked because I

39
00:02:03,329 --> 00:02:05,729
never thought this kind of stuff would

40
00:02:05,729 --> 00:02:07,910
happen to me

41
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:10,440
as well because I'm very passionate

42
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:13,709
about the stuff that I do and I do spend

43
00:02:13,709 --> 00:02:17,010
time in the computer even outside work

44
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:19,050
experimenting with stuff so for me to

45
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:21,060
tell me for a month to sit in the

46
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:23,220
computer or even use the telephone

47
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:25,380
because they told me that as well not

48
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:26,819
only the computer but the fact that you

49
00:02:26,819 --> 00:02:28,950
spend time probably in your telephone so

50
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:32,310
I pin the tendons get tired of that and

51
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:35,130
everybody's different now - every person

52
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:37,769
can happen and anyway after that

53
00:02:37,769 --> 00:02:39,870
happened to me I started to take care of

54
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:43,230
myself I got myself birdy called Mouse

55
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:47,640
and I started to take more breaks and

56
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:52,709
watch out in my free time not spending

57
00:02:52,709 --> 00:02:54,690
too much time in the computer doing

58
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:59,310
stuff more active and it came it became

59
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:03,510
better after a year actually taking care

60
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:06,000
of that I stopped having the pain of my

61
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,069
arm but I guess when it got better I

62
00:03:10,069 --> 00:03:13,620
again thought okay now I'm good so it

63
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:16,290
doesn't matter I can still like push it

64
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:19,109
again and then half a year later earlier

65
00:03:19,109 --> 00:03:21,000
this year I started to have really

66
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,450
really a lot of pain now in my back so

67
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:28,829
then I am back to the doctor and they

68
00:03:28,829 --> 00:03:32,609
told me out let's go onto an MRI so to

69
00:03:32,609 --> 00:03:34,440
see if there's actually something

70
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:36,630
particular in there and then it turns

71
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:38,760
out that actually yes I started to

72
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,630
off one of my discs in my lower back now

73
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:45,180
it the gel that we have in our spine in

74
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:47,280
the lower back if somebody had ever had

75
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:52,019
this it starting to get out of or expand

76
00:03:52,019 --> 00:03:56,160
it's cold and I'm really lucky the

77
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:58,709
doctor told me that it's not so much

78
00:03:58,709 --> 00:04:01,380
that is going out at the moment that he

79
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:03,389
told me I don't need any medicine or

80
00:04:03,389 --> 00:04:06,810
surgery because some people if this gel

81
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:10,549
that we have in our spine gets out

82
00:04:10,549 --> 00:04:12,989
usually you might need surgery or

83
00:04:12,989 --> 00:04:15,180
cortisone and

84
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:19,590
yeah more therapy but he just

85
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:21,510
recommended me to do more exercise and

86
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:23,100
to what more heat on me if you don't

87
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:26,100
like to do sports just go out and don't

88
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:28,620
fit too long if you go back home as well

89
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:31,470
sometimes sitting in the sofa is way too

90
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:34,530
much so I started to do that again and

91
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:37,410
taking care of myself going out trying

92
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:39,870
to take a walk in the winter I find it

93
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:41,760
always very hard in here in this country

94
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:44,550
I'm from Mexico so then every time I

95
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:46,949
have to go out I'm like please no so

96
00:04:46,949 --> 00:04:49,080
that probably why I develop the problem

97
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,450
during the winter and and that's it I

98
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:53,340
just wanted to share my story because

99
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:55,550
before you get into this point always

100
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:58,780
listen to the signals so that's it

101
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:02,010
[Applause]
