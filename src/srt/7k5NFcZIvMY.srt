00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:21,510
lied to and stuff like that but I i I'm

6
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:23,970
a hardware guy so I don't really know

7
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:25,800
much about Java scream and stuff but I'm

8
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,199
gonna shave you guys what you can do so

9
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:30,750
I hope you guys can make use of the hard

10
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:32,969
way that you have they got you in the

11
00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:35,579
registration so there's my hand dollar

12
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:37,440
name you can find in the forum as well

13
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,660
if you need more help so I'm just gonna

14
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:41,430
show you the hardware that we are gonna

15
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:43,800
work with oh sorry I forgot to mention

16
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:47,100
that mariko is an IOT company so this

17
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:48,480
all of the Internet of Things

18
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,079
development kit which is the middle of a

19
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:54,750
lot of API endpoints so you guys should

20
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:58,410
be very familiar with it so I can run

21
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:00,930
the device here because i think the

22
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:02,730
mighty puppy blocks the part that we

23
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:05,549
need to talk to so i'm gonna send it to

24
00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:07,710
the device on the writing the one on the

25
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:09,180
right side that is running somewhere

26
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:11,670
else in my home okay so the two on the

27
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:13,740
left are like cellular versions but you

28
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,180
can spin too they're using the same

29
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:18,770
endpoint okay so um let me do the demo

30
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:23,009
so what I'm gonna do first it's let's

31
00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:25,189
look at this one here so one of the

32
00:01:25,189 --> 00:01:29,520
developer for party co-wrote d-sub web

33
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,520
app basically so it shows you the let me

34
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:36,420
just refresh so it shows the devices

35
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:38,369
that are online my car right now so you

36
00:01:38,369 --> 00:01:42,869
see three devices online and um let it

37
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:45,899
load so I guess you guys are familiar is

38
00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:47,430
open source you can take a look at this

39
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:49,619
one so these are some of the functions

40
00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:51,509
that are available the device that we

41
00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:53,850
coded so you can call it based on an API

42
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:55,729
endpoint so let me give you an example

43
00:01:55,729 --> 00:01:57,899
so let's say I have two device running

44
00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:00,329
now here so I want to know what's the

45
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:03,090
battery percentage left right now so i

46
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:07,199
just hit update here

47
00:02:07,209 --> 00:02:10,160
and your we get a value so the battery

48
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,750
is like ninety two percent right now so

49
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:13,790
everything is done by unaware if I know

50
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:15,260
you're not hot web developer you can

51
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:16,940
interact with a hardware device so

52
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:18,319
that's the beauty of using the

53
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:21,200
particular hardware key so let's do

54
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,330
something more interesting so I have a

55
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:25,580
code right now over here is using the

56
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:27,739
online web ide so what I'm gonna do is

57
00:02:27,739 --> 00:02:30,650
I'm gonna send this code publish it or

58
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:33,140
rather flashy to the device in my house

59
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:36,500
and it's gonna do a publish message

60
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:39,170
every 1.5 seconds so I guess you guys

61
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:40,580
are pretty familiar with the Popish

62
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:44,269
subscribing in in your Chavez people so

63
00:02:44,269 --> 00:02:49,070
let me just flash the code here so i got

64
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:50,930
even sent to the server compound and

65
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:52,910
what sitcom pulse it sends over to the

66
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:55,239
device so it is our flesh successful

67
00:02:55,239 --> 00:02:58,340
they have a dash both feature here as

68
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:02,510
well so you see a series of servers SS

69
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:05,720
events so you can see right now over

70
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,790
here the device is actually publishing

71
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:10,579
the event so these are some things that

72
00:03:10,579 --> 00:03:13,160
you can do you can check out the

73
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:17,269
documentation as well so it's as things

74
00:03:17,269 --> 00:03:18,470
that you guys are really familiar with

75
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:22,250
like API jason taylor coming back and

76
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:24,290
stuff like that so i hope you guys will

77
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:26,810
go home and explore the device play

78
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:29,630
around with it and do some cool stuff so

79
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:31,579
I'm some place that you can go to we

80
00:03:31,579 --> 00:03:34,489
have the forum so in the forum there's a

81
00:03:34,489 --> 00:03:36,200
lot of like project sharing and stuff

82
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,910
like that you can go and get some

83
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:40,220
project ideas I'm going east of your

84
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,630
hardware body and get them to do

85
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:43,640
something for you and make something

86
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:47,150
interesting with JavaScript so I hope

87
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:48,739
you guys had a better understanding of

88
00:03:48,739 --> 00:03:50,090
the highway there was even out the

89
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:52,570
innovation and hope you have some fun

90
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:54,920
Thank You Kenneth
