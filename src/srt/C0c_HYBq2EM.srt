00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:23,509

okay so yeah Nicole said I'm Ryan sin

2
00:00:23,509 --> 00:00:25,609
and you can find me on twitter i have a

3
00:00:25,609 --> 00:00:28,310
blog called the CSS ninja calm i also

4
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:32,000
work on moderniser and i work for a

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,910
company in Australia I called seek which

6
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:36,829
is like a job search website so monster

7
00:00:36,829 --> 00:00:40,879
com I think you guys I feel yes I hail

8
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:42,589
all the way from Melbourne Australia was

9
00:00:42,589 --> 00:00:45,949
a long flight here 25 hours all up if

10
00:00:45,949 --> 00:00:47,870
there's a one cool thing you need to

11
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:50,960
know about Melbourne is it was founded

12
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,830
by Batman that's a fact whether or not

13
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:56,299
it's the actual Batman is beyond the

14
00:00:56,299 --> 00:01:01,250
point so you're posting checkboxes a

15
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:02,989
pretty boring you know usually just

16
00:01:02,989 --> 00:01:04,420
agree to our Terms and Conditions

17
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:09,650
they've just go away that's because

18
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:13,420
maybe you are incorrect because oh

19
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:19,579
because when we use the check

20
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:21,170
pseudo-class we can get some awesome

21
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:24,650
stuff happening and that's it so that's

22
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:26,360
a custom check pork using check and it's

23
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:27,650
just putting up at animated gif from the

24
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:29,450
background so it's all powered by CSS

25
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:33,590
only it so essentially allows you to

26
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:35,840
create interaction with our JavaScript

27
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,960
so it gives you state to CCA so it gives

28
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:39,979
you an on state gives you an off state

29
00:01:39,979 --> 00:01:42,409
and allows you to react to a user's

30
00:01:42,409 --> 00:01:45,320
quick without having to do event

31
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:49,400
listeners with JavaScript so the first

32
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,320
thing you might think of is you can do

33
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:55,370
custom checkboxes and radios this is a

34
00:01:55,370 --> 00:01:56,960
cool example that I took from a

35
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,940
developer that Leah talked about who did

36
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:01,490
those are 11 buttons he did a really

37
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:03,470
cool example of doing radio buttons

38
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:05,090
where has a shiny dot looks like it

39
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:07,610
travels through and then the further way

40
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:08,989
you click the faster it looks like it

41
00:02:08,989 --> 00:02:13,849
moves and that's incredibly simple so

42
00:02:13,849 --> 00:02:15,680
all is is just in the mark-up this is an

43
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,080
input and a label and what we do is we

44
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,299
kind of throw away the input and we just

45
00:02:20,299 --> 00:02:21,950
use that for their it's checked ability

46
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:24,049
so whether it's checked or unchecked and

47
00:02:24,049 --> 00:02:26,180
what we do is we style the actual label

48
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:29,060
and we do that by using the direct

49
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:31,340
sibling Combinator selector which is the

50
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:33,410
plus so it allows me to say

51
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:34,700
want to target a label this directly

52
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:37,250
followed by an input and so all those

53
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:38,450
Styles pick up and then we've got the

54
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:40,190
checked class on the input so I can say

55
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:41,600
well when the inputs checked I want to

56
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,340
target the label change ourselves on

57
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:45,710
that and then the little neat trick here

58
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:48,410
to get all the other labels and inputs

59
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:50,210
to react to make it look like that dots

60
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:53,240
flowing through the whole the whole list

61
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:56,360
of radio buttons you can use the general

62
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,190
civilian Combinator which is will target

63
00:02:58,190 --> 00:03:00,650
any any sibling not the direct not just

64
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:04,430
the direct one and then that shiny dot

65
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:06,830
is just just a background image using

66
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:10,040
radial gradients I've haven't included

67
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,660
all the prefixes because otherwise it'll

68
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:15,380
be huge use border radius which we will

69
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:17,060
learn about and then the tricky irony is

70
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:18,260
just transitioning the background

71
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:20,720
position and then using a our cubic

72
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,940
Bezier curve to give it the illusion

73
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:25,420
that of speeding up the longer way it is

74
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:27,740
lever has got a really cool website

75
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:30,290
called cubic Bezier com which allows you

76
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:32,450
to visualize all those all those

77
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:36,650
animations it's really handy so I wrote

78
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:38,690
an article about this technique of doing

79
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:41,750
custom radios and checkboxes couple

80
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:44,180
years ago now so you can check out my

81
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:46,520
blog these slides would be up and off

82
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:49,580
the talk so you can check it out another

83
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:55,250
example is the tree menu have you ever

84
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:58,730
used a file system in a new computer you

85
00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:03,290
can expand folders I'm sure you've all

86
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:09,050
used up before and that's so that's

87
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:12,260
using check boxes believe enough so it's

88
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:13,790
just an ordered list and then so they

89
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:15,140
can go infinitely deep and you can have

90
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:16,970
infinite amount of check boxes in the

91
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:19,190
CSS is relatively simple to accomplish

92
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:22,070
that so you once again have an input in

93
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:23,900
the label and you style the label to

94
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:26,210
have the plus or minus since got like

95
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:28,040
the folder name and then below that

96
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:31,220
you've got like children ordered list to

97
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:34,130
denote that is like a subtree of that

98
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:38,419
folded list so I've simplified CSS

99
00:04:38,419 --> 00:04:40,130
soybeans fit in here so just picked out

100
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:43,970
the important bits so use the general

101
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:45,470
similan Combinator again to target all

102
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:45,980
ordered

103
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:48,050
this that our insider checked input and

104
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:50,450
we can set the height auto soda will

105
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:52,160
just expand to show all that all its

106
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,320
children we push it in to give the

107
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:57,380
illusion like it's you know below that

108
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:01,790
folder and it means a few after and

109
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:04,790
before generated content to add the icon

110
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:06,170
so the plus and minus depending of is

111
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:08,360
checked or unchecked and just using a

112
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:10,820
sprite and then all we do here is that

113
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:13,190
initially all this Titans display none

114
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:14,630
and then when you put checked they're

115
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:16,430
all block so just like expanding the

116
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:20,300
folder really simple stuff I wrote an

117
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:21,680
article about a two so they're going to

118
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:26,420
take it up so you know that's okay to be

119
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:32,480
boring so I i wrote a young thing called

120
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,940
bootleg dot CSS affection called the

121
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:37,280
dodgy version of bootstrap because I

122
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,720
took a whole bunch of bootstrap plugins

123
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,760
and made them say so silent using

124
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:45,590
checkboxes the first one is the drop

125
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:47,600
down so this is all I've just removed

126
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,890
all the JavaScript and just kept the

127
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:52,550
bootstrap CSS file so you can see now

128
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:55,250
I've made this red just so for visually

129
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:56,230
you can see what's going on but

130
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:59,300
essentially these dropdowns here if you

131
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:01,610
can see them they're just labels and

132
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:03,080
when I click that I check see the

133
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:06,950
checkbox that then shows the menu below

134
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:09,800
it and this red background is actually

135
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,870
another label that expands to the full

136
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:13,250
width of the window this is an iframe so

137
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:14,360
that's why it's not expanding the full

138
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:17,090
width so then I can click anywhere in

139
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:18,920
dismiss it so used to clicking somewhere

140
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,120
and I'll just click over here I don't

141
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,760
want that menu up anymore just to give

142
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,080
that interactivity and basically this

143
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,540
label targets another input that just

144
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:27,950
make sure is everything is closed and

145
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:29,960
it's a common sort of technique I use

146
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:33,870
throughout some of these other plugins

147
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:36,320
so the mark-up is exactly the same as

148
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:39,470
the the bootstrap example as is Bruce

149
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:40,910
trapped too I'm not sure of receptor has

150
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:44,330
changed yeah so you can see here of the

151
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:47,960
label is that drop-down button and then

152
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:49,250
it's just got the unordered list which

153
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:51,530
shows the menu items and then I've got

154
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:56,150
that label down here which when this

155
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:58,520
one's checked it expands to the full

156
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,590
width of the window so you can click

157
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:02,210
anywhere to dismiss it quite easily and

158
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:03,919
then just down the bottom this is the

159
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:05,599
input that our targets to make sure

160
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:08,120
everything's hidden saying any false

161
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:11,360
negatives and then the CSS is real easy

162
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,970
so initially for the dismiss I have a

163
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:15,259
display none but I have a whole bunch of

164
00:07:15,259 --> 00:07:16,940
style set up to say its position fix and

165
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:18,530
it expands to the full container of the

166
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:22,009
window and then all I have down here is

167
00:07:22,009 --> 00:07:24,379
on the input I say when that inputs

168
00:07:24,379 --> 00:07:26,740
checked or so the radios checked I

169
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:29,270
display the drop-down menu in dismissing

170
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:31,069
set the display block and then all the

171
00:07:31,069 --> 00:07:32,240
blue stripe styles take care of how

172
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:36,620
everything else looks there's a collapse

173
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:39,830
or accordion once again I've got there

174
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:43,400
the red showing there so you can see

175
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,319
where not when I activate one of them it

176
00:07:45,319 --> 00:07:46,580
actually displays the label of the top

177
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:48,530
psyche and then just dismiss it keep

178
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:57,680
showing it and this also has a so has

179
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,229
like a top level collapse all radio

180
00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:01,639
button that is targeted to make sure if

181
00:08:01,639 --> 00:08:03,229
I have none of them checked and they're

182
00:08:03,229 --> 00:08:05,330
all collapsed and you know in the odd

183
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:08,840
styling I've got the input up here for

184
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:12,199
each specific item that needs to be open

185
00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:13,479
and closed and then I've got the label

186
00:08:13,479 --> 00:08:15,860
here and I just use the for attribute to

187
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:18,319
make sure I can target it the reason the

188
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:20,810
input is not inside this accordion

189
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:22,969
header is because the limitations of

190
00:08:22,969 --> 00:08:26,690
using CSS I can't work my way out of a

191
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:28,279
container after work my way down using

192
00:08:28,279 --> 00:08:30,620
the general civilian Combinator or the

193
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:32,060
direction coming out of the plus all the

194
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:38,029
tilde and then so the CC is here so I

195
00:08:38,029 --> 00:08:40,130
use a trick so you may have noticed that

196
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:43,490
I'm like this one's a different height

197
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:44,390
to the other ones but it's still

198
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:47,029
experienced to just be the height of the

199
00:08:47,029 --> 00:08:51,320
content so you can use a trick of using

200
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,820
Mac's light rather than height so

201
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:55,370
originally I think near Safari 6 and the

202
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:58,100
latest chrome can transition from height

203
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:01,010
0 to high order before you can do that

204
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:02,360
another browsers can't so you can use

205
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:05,390
the trick or max height so initially

206
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:07,370
when it's not checked it's got max 50

207
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:09,740
the height you set to auto we set up the

208
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:12,380
transition when it's checked

209
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:15,200
set the height to 500 so it may not be

210
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,600
500 a might be like 100 pixels and then

211
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:21,110
we'll just expand to its container then

212
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:23,050
you get some of your timing issues

213
00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:25,130
because it's doing max Heights trying to

214
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:27,440
calculate it so when it's when it's

215
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,360
collapsing it will collapse over 200

216
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,400
milliseconds and then I adjust the

217
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,680
duration here to say it's over seven

218
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:34,670
hundred milliseconds so they sort of

219
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:35,930
look like they're happening at the same

220
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:40,290
time but you still get some odd behavior

221
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:44,000
we've got some tabs this is where you

222
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,800
start get to the ugly side of this this

223
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,900
hack and you have to have specific

224
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:49,580
marker placement and the CSS selectors

225
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:53,330
get really nasty so the mark up here we

226
00:09:53,330 --> 00:09:57,200
have to have each top-level tab item has

227
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,940
to be input label can't be inside any

228
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:01,000
sort of ordered list or unordered list

229
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,920
because there'd selector restriction and

230
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:07,220
then each container is shown and so let

231
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:10,310
me get huge selectors like this because

232
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:14,570
of their constraints so I need to target

233
00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:17,000
the first input and I do enth of type

234
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,490
and not into child because we've got

235
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:21,860
input label input label if i did a child

236
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:24,920
and it'll get the wrong item so you make

237
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:26,270
sure that it's an input and it's the

238
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:28,760
first one and if it's checked then we

239
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:31,370
find the tab content sibling and then we

240
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:33,460
look inside that and we find the first

241
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:35,930
deaf so everyone so when the first one's

242
00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:37,010
checked we wanted to show you the first

243
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:39,830
content and vice versa when a son check

244
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:47,480
that's them displaying on modals that's

245
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,490
cool so you get the same same transition

246
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:50,840
you've got it fades in the background

247
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:53,120
pops down I've made a background red so

248
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:56,360
you can see see it fading a bit better I

249
00:10:56,360 --> 00:11:00,860
can click there dismiss it I can click

250
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:02,510
the cross so like tan all behavior that

251
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:07,880
you used to with the bootstrap Murray so

252
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:10,610
yeah the that label is styled to look

253
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:12,920
like a button but really it's a label

254
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:15,200
we've got the input and then you've got

255
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,450
the modal container so these need to be

256
00:11:17,450 --> 00:11:20,690
at sibling level so in order for me to

257
00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:22,460
go when he puts check toggle that modal

258
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:24,290
and show it and do the animations and

259
00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:25,860
then we use

260
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:29,310
the clothes modal input to do the

261
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:32,130
overlay so when the when you've launched

262
00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:35,010
a mogul we use the red background I saw

263
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:36,630
was a just a label that's expanded to

264
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:39,480
the full width of the window and so

265
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:41,459
that's used to close it and and as the

266
00:11:41,459 --> 00:11:43,290
transparent background that you get that

267
00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:47,910
used to seeing with modal's and the CSS

268
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:51,589
is is really easy so you've got there

269
00:11:51,589 --> 00:11:54,720
using the General Assembly Combinator

270
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,920
the target the mobile in cases any

271
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,990
elements in between the input and actual

272
00:11:57,990 --> 00:12:00,300
motor container this is just an initial

273
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:03,000
Stiles to get it set up we use we

274
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,459
transition the transform over a period

275
00:12:05,459 --> 00:12:07,260
of time when we do the opacity as well

276
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:10,890
and then to get it out of you initially

277
00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:13,050
we just set its initial translate value

278
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:14,640
to be one hundred percent out of the

279
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:15,930
viewport so it's sitting up out of the

280
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:18,269
window you can't see it anywhere just

281
00:12:18,269 --> 00:12:20,760
checked what we want to do to get that

282
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,260
same effect of the background fades in

283
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:25,290
and then then the thing slides downs we

284
00:12:25,290 --> 00:12:27,329
just want to stick we just adjust the

285
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:31,260
transition delay to not not do that

286
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:32,850
transition for 400 milliseconds while

287
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:35,820
the other things fading in so you can

288
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:38,790
see on the on the modal close input with

289
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:42,180
in transition the opacity then and so

290
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:44,279
when it's checked the opacity is changed

291
00:12:44,279 --> 00:12:46,709
you could always use a rgba as well you

292
00:12:46,709 --> 00:12:49,260
don't have to use a pacity and then we

293
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:51,180
just make sure there's no delay I want

294
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:52,500
to check and I need to make sure that

295
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,000
it's not actually the clothes modal

296
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,110
because then you will get confusion

297
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:57,360
where when the clothes input is checked

298
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,430
then we'll get we'll try to target the

299
00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:01,019
label below it and we'll get in a red

300
00:13:01,019 --> 00:13:03,480
state so we just use not selector say

301
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,940
well if if the input is not closed modal

302
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:07,199
that's currently checked so we want to

303
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:08,880
make sure that when they launched the

304
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:09,959
modal we don't get any weird behavior

305
00:13:09,959 --> 00:13:12,029
then then target the modal clothes label

306
00:13:12,029 --> 00:13:18,449
and display it there's a image carousel

307
00:13:18,449 --> 00:13:22,079
as well it's just nice and you may

308
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:24,839
notice some similarities between this

309
00:13:24,839 --> 00:13:29,550
and the slide deck so it's like going on

310
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:33,959
this so I got to be carried away with

311
00:13:33,959 --> 00:13:35,760
this talk I go call it in the meta

312
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:36,860
process

313
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:43,280
of a deep as always I get caught up in

314
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,870
the meta process of creating slides and

315
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:46,340
they ended up creating a check box

316
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:50,330
powered slide for my check box talk so

317
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:54,290
and I and I called it book I've

318
00:13:54,290 --> 00:13:56,000
always liked that name so the carousel

319
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,350
and slide show Bob have very much and

320
00:13:57,350 --> 00:14:02,030
very similar in how they work so we'll

321
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:04,700
jump to the editor so I just push this

322
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:06,770
to github the slideshow book but

323
00:14:06,770 --> 00:14:12,170
basically it is it is just a bunch of

324
00:14:12,170 --> 00:14:15,950
classes here and then I use SAS because

325
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:19,250
there's some some crazy selectors going

326
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:20,900
on there and be like you're just not my

327
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:22,160
brain trying to work out all the math

328
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,810
because it needs to know how many slides

329
00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:25,760
you have to calculate where it's best to

330
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,530
transform the slide as you transition

331
00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:30,260
between each slot so I've got this mix

332
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:32,480
in that loops over a variable so good a

333
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,100
variable slow count so you know demo one

334
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:37,250
there's 11 slides I'll then loop over

335
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:40,160
that and we'll work out all the

336
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,160
calculation and he seduces lots of um

337
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,330
working out well if it's this slide

338
00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:45,920
number they need to divide it by 100 and

339
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,720
work out the percentage that needs to do

340
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:50,000
based on this light count and SAS made

341
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,800
it really easy let's go a nice build

342
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,210
process so I just run grunt and will

343
00:14:53,210 --> 00:14:54,680
generate based on this load count the

344
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:59,240
CSS file so the output here you can see

345
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:04,250
first scroll down you can see it's

346
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:05,720
putting out all these crazy selectors to

347
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,580
work out when it needs to show the left

348
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:08,870
and right button when it needs to flip

349
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:11,450
it based on which cat you're on so like

350
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:13,490
initially you've got the second label

351
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:15,710
that sits on the right side and then

352
00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:17,030
when I go to the second one then it

353
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:18,620
suddenly needs to position on the left

354
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:19,820
side and you need a third one there

355
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:22,250
there's a lot going on so SAS makes this

356
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:24,020
a lot easier and I don't have to worry

357
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:26,240
about working out or the the

358
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,970
calculations you can see like the

359
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:31,670
default decimal places percentage it

360
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:34,070
gets gets a little out of hand so sets

361
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:36,950
makes it it's usually much easier

362
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:45,210
process

363
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:48,910
so quirks and bug so it's not all some

364
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:54,490
sunshine lollipops in chat box world so

365
00:15:54,490 --> 00:15:57,160
for a while there WebKit couldn't handle

366
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:00,339
checked and the general signaling

367
00:16:00,339 --> 00:16:02,259
Combinator that's being fixed down and

368
00:16:02,259 --> 00:16:05,079
Safari 5.1 and chrome 13 we're up to

369
00:16:05,079 --> 00:16:09,819
like chrome 900 now I think so yeah

370
00:16:09,819 --> 00:16:11,259
that's like a long-gone thing but if you

371
00:16:11,259 --> 00:16:12,370
have to support older browsers

372
00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:14,339
especialista fire which is I up to six

373
00:16:14,339 --> 00:16:17,110
it wouldn't actually activate the style

374
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:18,970
so if you initially had the checked

375
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:20,620
attribute on input it would pick up

376
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:23,290
these styles but if you wants you as a

377
00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:24,970
user you checked another tech box it

378
00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:27,579
wouldn't actually pick it up so that was

379
00:16:27,579 --> 00:16:29,319
a big issue so it would work with a

380
00:16:29,319 --> 00:16:30,519
directive in Combinator but that

381
00:16:30,519 --> 00:16:34,269
restricted you to the position of a

382
00:16:34,269 --> 00:16:36,639
container that input should alter when

383
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:42,069
you check it any of the kenai people

384
00:16:42,069 --> 00:16:43,240
there may have noticed I had a lot of on

385
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:45,480
click empty attributes on the labels

386
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:48,069
this is there because of an issue in iOS

387
00:16:48,069 --> 00:16:52,209
5 where a label click click on a label

388
00:16:52,209 --> 00:16:53,850
wouldn't actually check the checkbox and

389
00:16:53,850 --> 00:16:57,550
I figured out somehow that I'm putting

390
00:16:57,550 --> 00:16:59,649
an empty on click on there would

391
00:16:59,649 --> 00:17:02,139
actually give it a kick up the ass and

392
00:17:02,139 --> 00:17:05,439
tell to check the checkbox that was a

393
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:06,789
really known bug bears good to find a

394
00:17:06,789 --> 00:17:09,549
solution to that but then you get there

395
00:17:09,549 --> 00:17:12,189
because of a click event has a throwing

396
00:17:12,189 --> 00:17:14,350
a millisecond delay you get that issue

397
00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:15,789
where it can be a bit slow when it

398
00:17:15,789 --> 00:17:17,380
checks on RS 5 it's been fixed and I or

399
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:22,870
six which is good downsides it is a huge

400
00:17:22,870 --> 00:17:29,549
hack there's no denying that there's

401
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:32,049
accessibility issues so i talked to a

402
00:17:32,049 --> 00:17:35,679
good friend jason kiss who's based in

403
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:37,570
new zealand is on very good

404
00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:41,049
accessibility expert no just wanting to

405
00:17:41,049 --> 00:17:43,659
review and confirm my beliefs that this

406
00:17:43,659 --> 00:17:46,210
is horrible if you have screen reader

407
00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:48,610
users and you confirmed that it was

408
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:50,850
horrible

409
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:53,680
because the problem is that a label

410
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,810
can't have a role attribute to make it

411
00:17:55,810 --> 00:17:58,690
appear as like a button it's an invalid

412
00:17:58,690 --> 00:18:00,730
thing so a label cannot ever be a button

413
00:18:00,730 --> 00:18:03,220
so like the pad the modal with a label

414
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:05,110
styled like a button a screen reader

415
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:06,250
would see a label and black what the

416
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:07,900
hell's going on you've got no way of

417
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:13,390
switching switching so you put the Aria

418
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:15,550
attributes of like Aria hidden equals

419
00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:17,290
true and then when you switch to display

420
00:18:17,290 --> 00:18:18,880
some you can't programmatically change

421
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,350
attributes and CSS that's where you need

422
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:24,680
JavaScript so thorough downfalls there

423
00:18:24,690 --> 00:18:27,400
sometimes requires specific places of

424
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,620
markup and by sometimes I mean all the

425
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:32,230
time so you need you've got that

426
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:34,080
restriction of that it's only siblings

427
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,220
the sibling combinator so they need to

428
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:38,440
be on the same level so like would i

429
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:39,790
share with tabs you get that sort of

430
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:41,920
ugly placement of markup and you get the

431
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:45,010
crazy CSS selectors to gso you get

432
00:18:45,010 --> 00:18:47,200
overly complex electives using the plus

433
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:50,170
until the which son can hope your head

434
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:54,050
when you need to manually work them out

435
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:59,290
so browser support look at the browser

436
00:18:59,290 --> 00:19:01,930
ponies here pretty cool so basically

437
00:19:01,930 --> 00:19:03,340
basically means that they support

438
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:05,950
checked fancy is like Renault Sport

439
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:08,170
transitions and all the other nice stuff

440
00:19:08,170 --> 00:19:13,410
to done makes it nicer to look at so now

441
00:19:13,410 --> 00:19:15,670
least you there I 9 didn't support

442
00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:17,110
transitions it was the first one to

443
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:19,390
support checked before that I didn't

444
00:19:19,390 --> 00:19:24,030
support it I 10 introduced the

445
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:26,170
transitions animations so you can get

446
00:19:26,170 --> 00:19:27,640
the nice effects going on here and

447
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:32,080
otherwise it's pretty safe to do a hack

448
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:39,550
around with it so the future maybe so

449
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:42,520
that is a spec roller who works with

450
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:44,350
google called tab Atkins who on his blog

451
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:49,840
blog wrote a proposal on there for being

452
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:52,180
able to toggle any element they

453
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:53,830
introduce these properties as four of

454
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:55,750
them and I've got to hear called toggle

455
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:59,340
dash star so toggle states toggle share

456
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:02,960
so going back to that modal example

457
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,360
on that modal I can say well this models

458
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:08,029
got two states it's other hidden or

459
00:20:08,029 --> 00:20:10,520
displayed the idea is this is well you

460
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:11,779
can have more than two states so you can

461
00:20:11,779 --> 00:20:14,299
just keep cycling through and have you

462
00:20:14,299 --> 00:20:16,460
know as many states as you need and then

463
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:19,460
and then I can use that checked pseudo

464
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:22,820
class on any element so I doesn't have

465
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:25,130
to be an input and I can react to when

466
00:20:25,130 --> 00:20:27,740
when the state changes and then using

467
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:29,809
the toggle share which is which works

468
00:20:29,809 --> 00:20:31,100
the same way as a for attribute on a

469
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:34,940
label so I can associate toggling of

470
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:36,559
state with no element I can just say

471
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:40,159
well on this model Moodle button pass in

472
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:43,460
a simple CSS selector saying well you've

473
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:45,890
got it you can alter the toggle state of

474
00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:48,140
that element and then you can avoid

475
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:50,809
those crazy selectors that you saw makes

476
00:20:50,809 --> 00:20:52,789
it much easier but at the moment it's

477
00:20:52,789 --> 00:20:54,820
just a blog post on his personal blog

478
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:57,049
then who knows if you actually get to

479
00:20:57,049 --> 00:20:58,490
look at it and propose it and if people

480
00:20:58,490 --> 00:20:59,899
who accept it but I think that would be

481
00:20:59,899 --> 00:21:01,640
cool if we could have that rather than

482
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:04,960
using checkboxes and radios to hack it

483
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:09,830
that's it slides bootleg and slideshow

484
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:11,870
blogroll up and get up check it out from
