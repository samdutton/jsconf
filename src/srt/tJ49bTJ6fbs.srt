1
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:03,870

yeah so I'm galaxy Kate you can find me

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:05,310
at pretty much anything at galaxy Kate's

3
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:07,049
a comb I've got a total dumpster fire of

4
00:00:07,049 --> 00:00:10,740
a github repo also at galaxy Kate the

5
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:12,750
slides for this talk are going to be I'm

6
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:14,340
gonna go pretty fast so the slides for

7
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:16,529
this talk are at Galaxy heat comm slash

8
00:00:16,529 --> 00:00:19,350
PDFs I'll show a lot of random apps that

9
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:20,550
I've made and those are at galaxy

10
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:22,590
kake-dot-com such apps and you can just

11
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:24,390
find a bunch of stuff of mine at galaxy

12
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:27,330
Kade calm so a little bit about me I did

13
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:29,670
five years on spore in Sim City if you

14
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:32,430
ever played Spore I did the planets I'm

15
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:35,850
now six years into a PhD in generative

16
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:38,149
games and creativity tools of all types

17
00:00:38,149 --> 00:00:40,469
this is at the expressive intelligence

18
00:00:40,469 --> 00:00:44,460
studio at UC set UC Santa Cruz also can

19
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:45,660
I make a pitch to the conference

20
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:47,370
organizers to have decaf because I had

21
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:48,780
caffeinated this morning and we're all

22
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:51,140
gonna be the worst for it

23
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:52,980
life is hard for the chemically

24
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:55,199
sensitive I've done some contracting on

25
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:57,149
chatbots for the Google home and I

26
00:00:57,149 --> 00:00:59,489
released that open source as the battery

27
00:00:59,489 --> 00:01:01,079
finite state machine platform if any of

28
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:02,670
y'all saw the really excellent finite

29
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:04,439
state machine talk clearly this morning

30
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:06,360
here's another take on it yeah I made

31
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:08,010
tracery a language for generative BOTS

32
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:09,960
that currently runs about six thousand

33
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:12,990
active BOTS which is pretty exciting and

34
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:15,479
yeah I make generative art BOTS games

35
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:17,369
art tools and more and I like to teach

36
00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:18,750
other people how to do it so you know

37
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:22,259
here's a projected head that I've done I

38
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:24,210
really like the leap motion and leap

39
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:27,420
motion works I've done procedural dance

40
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:28,829
generation

41
00:01:28,829 --> 00:01:32,100
here are some generated butterflies this

42
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:33,780
is a little generated train travel

43
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:36,270
through Europe game and then this is

44
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:37,710
just some flowers doing attractive

45
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:43,200
things yeah so my talk today is about

46
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,880
generative art but like why should I

47
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:45,960
bring this to a JavaScript conference

48
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:47,850
it's because a lot of my favorite

49
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:49,710
generative art pieces both my own and of

50
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:51,689
others they're interactive there are

51
00:01:51,689 --> 00:01:53,759
things that people can touch and play

52
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:55,770
with and this is true of a lot of

53
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:57,750
interesting generative stuff we've we've

54
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:59,670
all worked with generative art if you've

55
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:00,920
used a pottery wheel it sort of

56
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,979
mechanically assisted creativity

57
00:02:03,979 --> 00:02:06,270
everything from spire graphs to mitting

58
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:08,700
can kind of fall into this category you

59
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:11,599
may have feelings when you see this

60
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:14,480
if denied we use kid pecks as a kid now

61
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,859
not so many people and what if it was an

62
00:02:15,859 --> 00:02:17,209
American thing but this is like a

63
00:02:17,209 --> 00:02:19,609
generative creativity tool from the very

64
00:02:19,609 --> 00:02:22,909
late 80s that got me started on this but

65
00:02:22,909 --> 00:02:25,180
you can generate pretty much anything

66
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:27,499
I've made tools for people but I've also

67
00:02:27,499 --> 00:02:29,180
gotten to see a lot of people making

68
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:31,189
interesting things everything from music

69
00:02:31,189 --> 00:02:33,950
to poetry Industrial Design generative

70
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:38,359
cocktail recipes so these are the top

71
00:02:38,359 --> 00:02:39,950
one is a poet there's a pottery

72
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:41,780
generator there's a necklace generator

73
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:44,419
and a music generator at the bottom but

74
00:02:44,419 --> 00:02:45,349
you can generate things like

75
00:02:45,349 --> 00:02:46,639
tensegrities architecture which is a

76
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:47,959
form of architecture that couldn't exist

77
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:50,810
before computers could help us generate

78
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:53,709
it this is some work by a group called

79
00:02:53,709 --> 00:02:56,239
nervous system and they do generative

80
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:59,269
dresses and generative necklaces but

81
00:02:59,269 --> 00:03:00,709
these are all interactive prototypes you

82
00:03:00,709 --> 00:03:02,120
can actually change how the necklace

83
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,680
looks before you get it 3d printed and

84
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,699
sent to you you can generate here we go

85
00:03:07,699 --> 00:03:10,730
these are two projects by NASA to do

86
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:12,739
procedurally generated stuff with

87
00:03:12,739 --> 00:03:15,560
genetic algorithms so if you represent a

88
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,750
radio antenna as a bent piece of metal

89
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:20,599
you can represent that as a string of

90
00:03:20,599 --> 00:03:23,389
DNA for each radio antenna decide how

91
00:03:23,389 --> 00:03:24,680
well it's going to perform how the

92
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,389
successful ones have lots of babies and

93
00:03:26,389 --> 00:03:28,099
those babies have babies and are judged

94
00:03:28,099 --> 00:03:30,709
and they got their best-ever radio

95
00:03:30,709 --> 00:03:32,000
antenna off of that which looks like a

96
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,139
BET paper clip but it's a very

97
00:03:33,139 --> 00:03:35,479
specifically bent paper clip later on

98
00:03:35,479 --> 00:03:37,009
they use that same method to figure out

99
00:03:37,009 --> 00:03:38,419
how to make a tensegrities ball walk

100
00:03:38,419 --> 00:03:40,400
this is something that no human could

101
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,159
program but it was you know the the ball

102
00:03:43,159 --> 00:03:45,409
that wobbled the best got to have many

103
00:03:45,409 --> 00:03:46,879
babies and then it's babies had babies

104
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:48,109
and eventually you get something that's

105
00:03:48,109 --> 00:03:52,790
sort of lurches here is a hot rod that

106
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:55,459
is procedurally generated the chassis is

107
00:03:55,459 --> 00:03:56,900
something that no human would design but

108
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:59,900
a machine could design it there's tools

109
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:01,159
like grasshopper 3d that make

110
00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:04,040
interesting pair of metric models you

111
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,479
can kind of 3d print these out in

112
00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:08,060
interesting ways there's a woman named

113
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:09,259
Bathsheba Grossman who's actually in

114
00:04:09,259 --> 00:04:11,439
Santa Cruz where I am he does

115
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:13,759
mathematical 3d generated models that

116
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:15,949
are 3d printed out sometimes quite large

117
00:04:15,949 --> 00:04:19,370
as art pieces you can generate things

118
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:20,690
with particles so these are strange

119
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:22,430
attractors which are imaginary swarms of

120
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:24,639
particles orbiting

121
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:27,520
strange way some sort of gravitational

122
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,830
body and then you can map their trails

123
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:31,659
on to 3d geometry and print those out

124
00:04:31,659 --> 00:04:33,969
you can print things using grammars so

125
00:04:33,969 --> 00:04:35,710
the grammars are a way of recursively

126
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:37,659
sticking objects to other objects so

127
00:04:37,659 --> 00:04:40,090
this is a bot that rolls Thingiverse

128
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:42,069
which is a 3d printing sight grabs

129
00:04:42,069 --> 00:04:43,569
objects glues them together and then

130
00:04:43,569 --> 00:04:46,120
reuploads them as art the community is

131
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:49,389
very confused as to whether that's a

132
00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:52,090
good thing or a bad thing I use a lot of

133
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:54,370
parametric particle based generations so

134
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:55,930
these are fabric generators that I've

135
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:59,650
made and these are all in canvas

136
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:02,169
processing your canvas some of them are

137
00:05:02,169 --> 00:05:05,139
SVG oh I did put little symbols of the

138
00:05:05,139 --> 00:05:08,110
technology that I used for all the ones

139
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:10,569
that are mine I uploaded these to a

140
00:05:10,569 --> 00:05:11,889
website and you can now buy them as

141
00:05:11,889 --> 00:05:15,099
t-shirts I made a version of this that

142
00:05:15,099 --> 00:05:19,150
generates the fabric patterns and then

143
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:21,039
prints it out on spoon flour so I'm

144
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:22,870
currently wearing a Java Script made

145
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:26,409
skirt one of the swags I have our Java

146
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:30,909
Script made scarves so yeah there's that

147
00:05:30,909 --> 00:05:33,520
skirt you know for you can of course

148
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,990
generate all sorts of things you can

149
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:40,120
generate animations games textures all

150
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:42,189
sorts of things for games so here's one

151
00:05:42,189 --> 00:05:43,089
of the creatures that I made when I

152
00:05:43,089 --> 00:05:47,020
worked on spore but then the the skins

153
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:48,610
of the creatures you have this 3d model

154
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:50,770
and you want a texture in some way you

155
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:52,419
can procedurally unwrap that creature

156
00:05:52,419 --> 00:05:53,919
even if it's a dynamic creature that the

157
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:55,029
user is made that you've never seen

158
00:05:55,029 --> 00:05:56,919
before you can unwrap it into you this

159
00:05:56,919 --> 00:05:59,289
sort of skin here and then the way we

160
00:05:59,289 --> 00:06:00,580
texture these creatures was actually

161
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:02,020
with particles where if you imagine you

162
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:03,639
have a white horse but you want a zebra

163
00:06:03,639 --> 00:06:06,520
you spawn black paintballs on top of it

164
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,710
drop them on top of the horse they stick

165
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:10,240
to the back of it they roll down getting

166
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,560
smaller and smaller as they go and you

167
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,360
get this sort of stripe pattern but then

168
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,300
if you put like a VW minibus or any sort

169
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:17,560
of object underneath that and run the

170
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,639
same script you'll get something that

171
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:20,860
has like zebra stripes even though you

172
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:22,449
didn't know you wanted the universe

173
00:06:22,449 --> 00:06:25,149
stripes before there's lots of video

174
00:06:25,149 --> 00:06:26,500
games that do procedural content

175
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,689
generation I don't think any of these

176
00:06:28,689 --> 00:06:30,060
are in JavaScript I think they're on

177
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:34,120
Java or Java like s-- but yeah these all

178
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:36,129
do procedurally generated levels so you

179
00:06:36,129 --> 00:06:38,380
can kind of if you have a game Java

180
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:40,300
you can make infinite levels to run

181
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:43,090
through you can generate stories so this

182
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:46,240
is minecraft not minecraft sorry Dwarf

183
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,060
Fortress which simulates years and years

184
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:53,230
of geology sociology ecology to simulate

185
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:56,440
3000 like 10000 years of dwarvish

186
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,670
history and then it puts you in the

187
00:06:57,670 --> 00:06:58,480
middle of it you can kind of

188
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:01,870
procedurally excavate as gameplay the

189
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:02,950
history of this world

190
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:05,590
you can even generate game rules so this

191
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:10,210
is work out of I believe NYU that

192
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:12,270
generates an adventure game dynamically

193
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:15,250
this one is generated game levels this

194
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:17,650
is a project called refraction and it

195
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:20,380
uses procedural generation not just to

196
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:22,180
design the levels but actually verify

197
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:23,740
that the levels are unbreakable by

198
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:26,620
players and then you can design games

199
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:28,480
themselves this is Yahveh this was also

200
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:32,190
a genetic algorithm that could design

201
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:34,540
systems of rules kind of like go where

202
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:35,860
it's like one piece can move like this

203
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:37,150
and you capture another piece like this

204
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:38,400
and the game board looks like this

205
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,720
generated thousands of those generated

206
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,400
the players for them have the players

207
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,990
play the games and then pick the ones

208
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:45,160
that the players made the most

209
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:47,380
interesting decisions and then they

210
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:49,330
produce that game gave it a generative

211
00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:51,730
name and sell it in stores so you can

212
00:07:51,730 --> 00:07:54,400
generate pretty much anything a common

213
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,380
phrase or a common sort of theme with

214
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:58,540
PCG talks is often oh wow

215
00:07:58,540 --> 00:07:59,770
you can save so much time and money

216
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:02,530
generating things and you don't have to

217
00:08:02,530 --> 00:08:03,940
hire artists anymore won't that be great

218
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:06,540
this actually doesn't work that great

219
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:11,970
you won't get robot artists but instead

220
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:14,230
you can have art that's made from user

221
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:16,360
input so you can have like in Spore we

222
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,950
had the users creating these complex

223
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:19,900
creatures and then we could dynamically

224
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:23,290
like on a millisecond level skin them

225
00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:25,360
texture that animate them and so the

226
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,590
player just feels like they're making

227
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:29,290
like magical clay and that's something

228
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:30,910
that no you can never have an artist

229
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:32,560
sitting there modeling those you know

230
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:34,360
millisecond by millisecond a second you

231
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,440
can have art that the computer and the

232
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,440
users make together and you can have art

233
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,849
that just goes on forever and ever and

234
00:08:39,849 --> 00:08:41,800
ever I make a lot of Twitter BOTS and

235
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,479
the Twitter bots if you set a Twitter

236
00:08:43,479 --> 00:08:45,010
bot to posting and the service never

237
00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:47,260
goes down it'll just keep producing

238
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:51,070
content every n seconds you can even

239
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:51,820
have an arts

240
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:53,560
bass that you can explore mathematically

241
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:55,600
I won't go too far into this but these

242
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,260
bots made scarves are actually made with

243
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:01,960
roughly a hundred sliders from zero to

244
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,700
one so each one has kind of a different

245
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:06,250
position of sliders you can imagine that

246
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:08,260
those are vectors in a tent in a hundred

247
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:10,660
dimensional space and so if I have this

248
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:12,340
scarf over here in this scarf over here

249
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:13,660
I can mathematically say what is this

250
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:16,360
scarf directly in the middle of those so

251
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,610
you can do interesting like interactions

252
00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:23,110
with that and yeah ways to interact with

253
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:25,690
a generator there's a lot of different

254
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:27,070
ways these are a couple of bots that are

255
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:29,410
running on my actually the sorting hat

256
00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:32,650
bot isn't running on my technology but

257
00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:34,030
these are bots that respond to people

258
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:35,950
that add them on Twitter so what do you

259
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:38,800
do with in with a JavaScript generator

260
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,650
well you can have it talk to people so

261
00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:43,150
the one at the bottom left is like my

262
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:46,630
bad comic generator and if you add it it

263
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:47,950
will make a little comic and say hey I

264
00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:50,620
made you this done since and Dragons is

265
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:52,090
an IKEA theme done just in the Dragons

266
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:56,020
bot and you can tweet at it to have a

267
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:57,870
little Dungeons and Dragons adventure

268
00:09:57,870 --> 00:09:59,890
there's lots of other really interesting

269
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:01,240
ways to interact with them everything

270
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:03,760
from you know I'm going to use my camera

271
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:07,030
like my can't like my face is input so

272
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:08,590
the one on the bottom right is Apple the

273
00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:11,380
one on the bottom left is me I'm doing a

274
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:12,790
particle simulation that kind of draws

275
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:14,740
these interesting rainbow things this

276
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:16,360
from interaction is really interesting

277
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,370
because you get people kind of having

278
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:21,730
this mask that moves and they start to

279
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:23,350
move their heads and body is in really

280
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:24,580
interesting way so if you've ever

281
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:26,050
studied you'd like masks or dance or

282
00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:29,050
costume theory you can get people to

283
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:31,510
move differently when you generate stuff

284
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:34,300
around them the one on the top left is

285
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,970
somebody who used tracery to generate

286
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:40,080
code and then that code ran through a

287
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:44,400
dynamic Creator of texture and of

288
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,690
animation and sound and they use this to

289
00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:49,300
like do a rave in London

290
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:50,950
the one in the upper right is like kind

291
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:52,570
of you have a gesture so the user has

292
00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:54,100
made some sort of gesture and you're

293
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:55,510
doing something with that gesture so

294
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:57,460
that one actually is the one in the top

295
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:58,480
right and bottom left are both running

296
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,850
in JavaScript so the one on the top

297
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:03,370
right is this is a commission from a 3d

298
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:04,600
printing company and they wanted

299
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,649
something so it's that

300
00:11:05,649 --> 00:11:06,999
anybody could draw a pennant that could

301
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:09,009
be 3d printed out so this is basically

302
00:11:09,009 --> 00:11:10,540
like if you take one thing away from

303
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:12,970
this talk it's that symmetry is like the

304
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:16,089
MSG of generative art if you have

305
00:11:16,089 --> 00:11:18,189
something bad just put symmetry on it

306
00:11:18,189 --> 00:11:22,029
and suddenly it looks a lot better so

307
00:11:22,029 --> 00:11:23,379
yeah you can generate anything like

308
00:11:23,379 --> 00:11:25,929
geometry sound texture texts recipes you

309
00:11:25,929 --> 00:11:27,279
can use it for any reason you can make

310
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:28,990
generators so I know a lot of the people

311
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:30,759
in this room or like at this conference

312
00:11:30,759 --> 00:11:33,879
might be like doing very fairly serious

313
00:11:33,879 --> 00:11:36,879
like div pushing for large enterprise

314
00:11:36,879 --> 00:11:39,550
solutions but you can also just go home

315
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:41,350
and make a Twitter bot in like five

316
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:41,889
minutes

317
00:11:41,889 --> 00:11:43,420
you can make something for an arts

318
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:44,679
festival you can make something to amuse

319
00:11:44,679 --> 00:11:47,379
yourself you can make something that has

320
00:11:47,379 --> 00:11:49,959
a political aim or you can do it for fun

321
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:52,360
or for fashion but yeah so how do you do

322
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:54,399
it so second half of this talk let's

323
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:57,040
talk about making a generator these are

324
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,990
two art BOTS the one on the left is from

325
00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:01,990
the 1700s and it uses cams to

326
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:03,639
mechanically draw images it's actually

327
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:05,740
programmable where you can like set the

328
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:07,480
cogs in certain ways that it like writes

329
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:09,970
text the one on the right is the

330
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:11,589
watercolor bought from evil mad

331
00:12:11,589 --> 00:12:13,749
scientist labs where you draw in a

332
00:12:13,749 --> 00:12:15,939
window and then it like has the robot

333
00:12:15,939 --> 00:12:20,230
draw it for you with watercolors so yeah

334
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:23,949
these are two different things there's a

335
00:12:23,949 --> 00:12:25,179
phrase we used to use on Spore which is

336
00:12:25,179 --> 00:12:26,589
called an artist in a box so you're

337
00:12:26,589 --> 00:12:29,610
making your generator is trying to be

338
00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:31,839
like trying to have the mind of an

339
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:33,370
artist but you're putting it in a box

340
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:35,379
and sending see user whether or not you

341
00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:36,639
know on Spore that was actually a shiny

342
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:38,439
plastic disc but now you know you're

343
00:12:38,439 --> 00:12:39,939
creating something that's gonna run on a

344
00:12:39,939 --> 00:12:43,540
server so the idea is kind of what are

345
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:45,819
the virtues of your artist this depends

346
00:12:45,819 --> 00:12:48,220
on what you're making this talk is

347
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:50,110
always hard to give because I as I've

348
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:51,069
just said you can make pretty much

349
00:12:51,069 --> 00:12:52,689
anything so what does it mean to be a

350
00:12:52,689 --> 00:12:54,699
good architect what does it mean to be a

351
00:12:54,699 --> 00:12:56,290
good storyteller on Twitter what does it

352
00:12:56,290 --> 00:12:58,689
mean to like be good at having a

353
00:12:58,689 --> 00:13:00,579
conversation with somebody so you

354
00:13:00,579 --> 00:13:02,079
basically once you figure out those

355
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:03,699
constraints about what must and must not

356
00:13:03,699 --> 00:13:06,189
happen and use those to build your

357
00:13:06,189 --> 00:13:08,379
generator I have more about that in this

358
00:13:08,379 --> 00:13:09,459
blog post so you want to build a

359
00:13:09,459 --> 00:13:11,499
generator so yeah how do we actually

360
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:14,949
build it so I have this thought I've

361
00:13:14,949 --> 00:13:17,199
built probably at least a hundred

362
00:13:17,199 --> 00:13:20,090
various art generators of various

363
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:21,440
and out of all this I've realized that

364
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,900
generativity is a pipeline so up here

365
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:26,450
are two fairly odd projects these are

366
00:13:26,450 --> 00:13:27,560
not mine

367
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:29,000
but they're both out of Design Studios

368
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,010
in Europe the well and they're both

369
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:33,260
taking brain waves and turning them into

370
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:34,880
furniture so you start with brain waves

371
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,740
and you're going to furniture and they

372
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:38,930
take very different paths to this so

373
00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:41,450
what the one on the left you are put

374
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:43,700
under an MRI scanner or a brain wave

375
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:46,160
scanner of some sort and told to think

376
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,890
about different kinds of furniture

377
00:13:47,890 --> 00:13:54,140
orange blue solid like not solid round

378
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:56,540
sharp and it measures your brain waves

379
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:57,830
and then it like generates a piece of

380
00:13:57,830 --> 00:13:59,390
furniture based on that and they've made

381
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:00,560
that guy that piece of furniture and he

382
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:04,640
hates it and so it's art the one on the

383
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:06,410
right is it actually measures your brain

384
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:09,140
waves as the waves and then it stacks up

385
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:10,580
those waves and makes a piece of

386
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:11,600
furniture out of it but you're supposed

387
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,370
to think of the world weird comfortable

388
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:17,570
as it does so like two inputs two very

389
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:19,670
like two inputs to outputs that are the

390
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:22,010
same but the paths through them are very

391
00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:25,010
different so yeah you have some inputs

392
00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:27,950
and some outputs I made so I make a lot

393
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:29,270
of free tools and I open sourced them

394
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:31,340
all this is the deck of cards that I

395
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:33,500
made to help people think through how to

396
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,930
make generators and they're called the

397
00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:37,300
General Munoz and you can print them out

398
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:40,010
I have some decks of cards with me but I

399
00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:42,830
actually they're already promised to

400
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:45,830
people but ask me tomorrow we show you

401
00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:47,960
one and the idea is you have some inputs

402
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,490
so the ones with the blue stripe at the

403
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:52,640
top are inputs so here's the Kinect and

404
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:54,710
this is basically the pipeline of data

405
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:56,360
like you can never turn data into other

406
00:14:56,360 --> 00:15:00,110
data without like putting an algorithm

407
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:03,050
on it so this was why is it really hard

408
00:15:03,050 --> 00:15:04,850
to design for the leap motion versus

409
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:07,640
like the DDR pad and a lot of video

410
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,290
games take events and States as their

411
00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:12,260
input so like the sort of little beads

412
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:14,720
on a string are events and States so a

413
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,250
gamepad will create events in states

414
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:18,950
like I'm holding down a trigger or I'm

415
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:21,140
pressing a button and games are really

416
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:22,760
good at taking those as inputs so if I

417
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,320
have a gamepad I can make a game no

418
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,960
problem if I have a like rock band

419
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,490
guitar that's producing events in States

420
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:29,960
and oh boy I can totally make a game out

421
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:32,960
of that if I have a Kinect it's actually

422
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:36,410
like a mesh of vertices so like there's

423
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:38,930
a bunch of vertices sort of floating in

424
00:15:38,930 --> 00:15:40,610
space well how am I going to convert

425
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:43,130
those into you button presses that my

426
00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:44,930
videogame needs well you kind of have to

427
00:15:44,930 --> 00:15:46,310
have the detect gestures one so it's

428
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:48,980
like okay I'm gonna turn this set of

429
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:51,709
vector data into press button a and I'm

430
00:15:51,709 --> 00:15:53,029
gonna turn this set of vector data into

431
00:15:53,029 --> 00:15:56,209
press button maybe I wanted to do a

432
00:15:56,209 --> 00:15:58,339
project that had kind of a different

433
00:15:58,339 --> 00:16:00,830
approach to that so this is a project I

434
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:02,089
did called idle hands for an Arts

435
00:16:02,089 --> 00:16:02,660
Festival

436
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:04,670
this takes sleep motion data which is

437
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:07,279
vector data and then runs a Voronoi

438
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:09,200
algorithm on it which takes vector data

439
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:11,300
and turns it into triangles and that was

440
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:14,060
pretty much all I did this had my best

441
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:16,279
ever review which was from somebody who

442
00:16:16,279 --> 00:16:17,779
was fairly chemically altered he thought

443
00:16:17,779 --> 00:16:20,540
his hands were stuck in the screen not

444
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:21,980
in a bad way just in a way that he had

445
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:24,770
to like sit with for a while so this is

446
00:16:24,770 --> 00:16:27,140
kind of the general knows these are two

447
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:28,550
different ways of documented on Jenna

448
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:32,060
Rama knows but yeah like basically you

449
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:33,830
get the particle data you run it for one

450
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:35,149
hour you diagram you triangulate the

451
00:16:35,149 --> 00:16:36,649
regions you draw the polygons and you

452
00:16:36,649 --> 00:16:39,410
projected on a screen so this is kind of

453
00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:41,270
ways to think of how data wants to

454
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:43,880
transform into other data so yeah it's

455
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:46,100
kind of a pipeline but I want to show

456
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:47,480
you the Lego bricks that you're going to

457
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:50,180
use in the pipeline this is basically

458
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:53,540
the like tools you can use section if

459
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:54,740
you've ever wanted to generate something

460
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:57,170
and these are kind of the big ones that

461
00:16:57,170 --> 00:16:58,580
they fall into

462
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:00,830
so there's grammars which is one of my

463
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:02,420
favorites this is like you're making

464
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:04,579
things out of other things I have this

465
00:17:04,579 --> 00:17:05,929
language called tracery that I made

466
00:17:05,929 --> 00:17:08,209
which is basically like writing in JSON

467
00:17:08,209 --> 00:17:10,850
these recruits recursive recipes because

468
00:17:10,850 --> 00:17:12,470
it's JSON which is fairly safe somebody

469
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:14,480
actually made a node bot or like a node

470
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:17,300
service that host these JSON files and

471
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:19,250
post them to Twitter periodically this

472
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:20,420
is the one that's currently running six

473
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:22,490
thousand BOTS this is one the earliest

474
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:24,319
ones is hipster cocktails and you can

475
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:25,760
kind of see the recipe for making a

476
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,520
hipster cocktail you know it's got a

477
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:32,990
name it's got you know combine some

478
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:35,420
liquid with some other liquid put in

479
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:41,110
something and maybe make like yeah

480
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:43,100
somebody also figured out that because

481
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:44,450
it's generated text

482
00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:46,370
what's a kind of recursive text

483
00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:50,059
SVG HTML and so because I like fun

484
00:17:50,059 --> 00:17:52,130
JavaScript things I just been learning

485
00:17:52,130 --> 00:17:53,390
JavaScript at that point and my online

486
00:17:53,390 --> 00:17:57,080
editor had used HTML in jQuery to fill

487
00:17:57,080 --> 00:18:01,130
in my divs instead of txt text and so

488
00:18:01,130 --> 00:18:02,570
everything you put in would be parsed as

489
00:18:02,570 --> 00:18:04,610
actual HTML and so if somebody you

490
00:18:04,610 --> 00:18:06,080
figured out that you could do SVG with

491
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,260
that and then suddenly we had art bots

492
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:10,160
so yeah these are a couple of things

493
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,660
that I've made with tracery and SVG

494
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:14,180
these are some art generators spaceship

495
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:17,600
generators I made a taiko ytt outfit

496
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:18,890
generator because he wears really out

497
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:22,429
awesome outfits you can also do tiles

498
00:18:22,429 --> 00:18:23,990
which is the idea that like if I have

499
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:25,520
something that is split up into even

500
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,590
sections and I can kind of put things

501
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:28,730
into this section if you've ever played

502
00:18:28,730 --> 00:18:30,950
Settlers of Catan where you have like

503
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:32,420
this grid and you're putting tiles

504
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:34,880
randomly on it that's kind of using tile

505
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,040
based things but Diablo was one of the

506
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,179
first games that kind of use this for

507
00:18:38,179 --> 00:18:39,830
map generation and you can totally not

508
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:41,480
see that those are Maps up there but

509
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:42,410
there are maps that somebody is

510
00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:44,840
documented this is one of the oldest

511
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:48,800
ones this is an example of using tile

512
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,840
based music so this is not only

513
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:54,080
generation generativity from 1700 it's

514
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,990
IP infringement from the 1700s this is

515
00:18:56,990 --> 00:18:58,670
not actually by Mozart but it the

516
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:00,920
publisher said it was and this is called

517
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:02,780
vais music and so you roll some dice and

518
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:04,640
then you pick out the measure and you

519
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,860
like put a bunch of measures together so

520
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:09,890
it's like I mean if music is kind of a

521
00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:12,050
grid of measures then you can just like

522
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:15,250
paste in the tiles of new measures

523
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:17,630
parametric is another one that I use a

524
00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:19,130
lot this is basically the idea that you

525
00:19:19,130 --> 00:19:21,530
have a lot of sliders as seen up above

526
00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:24,320
so this is a flower generator that uses

527
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:27,260
32 different sliders and I can do all

528
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:29,780
sorts of fun stuff like I can actually

529
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:31,820
control this with music or I can control

530
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:34,309
it with hand gestures or I can have the

531
00:19:34,309 --> 00:19:36,080
the user navigate it in different ways

532
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,670
so the one at the bottom is you're just

533
00:19:37,670 --> 00:19:38,750
picking the flower that you like the

534
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:40,010
best and you're sort of procedurally

535
00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:43,790
evolving them there's kind of a whole

536
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:45,230
class of ones that are like geometric

537
00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:47,390
transformations this is something like

538
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:50,860
you've got a curve you play okay cool so

539
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:53,120
the user has made some sort of gesture

540
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,940
either with your hand or with a mouth

541
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:58,370
mouth mouth or with whatever input

542
00:19:58,370 --> 00:19:59,710
you've got

543
00:19:59,710 --> 00:20:01,610
you could do it with a mouth that would

544
00:20:01,610 --> 00:20:03,799
be interesting and then you're gonna

545
00:20:03,799 --> 00:20:05,269
take that curve and do something

546
00:20:05,269 --> 00:20:07,190
interesting along it so a lot of these

547
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:08,690
techniques are kind of like you have

548
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:10,700
some input I want you to exaggerate and

549
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:13,669
riff on that input in some way so the

550
00:20:13,669 --> 00:20:16,100
one at the top is IO brush you can use a

551
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:18,799
webcam to sort of slurp up images and

552
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:20,360
then you can paint them along a curve

553
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:22,789
that's about maybe 12 years old by now

554
00:20:22,789 --> 00:20:25,190
but at the bottom is tilt brush which

555
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:27,200
you're drawing curves in 3d and then

556
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,179
they've got all sorts of like a whole

557
00:20:29,179 --> 00:20:30,710
library of interesting stuff that you

558
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:32,480
can do along that curve like glitter

559
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:33,950
effects and particle effects and

560
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:36,590
animations and like sort of different

561
00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:39,259
stuff here a couple of works that I've

562
00:20:39,259 --> 00:20:42,320
done in curves these the one at the top

563
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:45,679
is how I generated any scarves using

564
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:47,179
these curves and making interesting SVG

565
00:20:47,179 --> 00:20:49,009
along them the one at the bottom is

566
00:20:49,009 --> 00:20:50,149
actually a lick motion thing where you

567
00:20:50,149 --> 00:20:51,649
can draw with your hands and then it

568
00:20:51,649 --> 00:20:54,440
makes kind of interesting living curves

569
00:20:54,440 --> 00:21:00,200
out of it yeah let's see oh here we go

570
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,210
here's one that like takes curves and

571
00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:04,070
draws floral patterns along am i I

572
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:05,419
really don't know what I'm doing with a

573
00:21:05,419 --> 00:21:06,649
lot of these like I just kind of

574
00:21:06,649 --> 00:21:09,259
decorate the curves and then figure out

575
00:21:09,259 --> 00:21:10,909
an interesting form of interaction for

576
00:21:10,909 --> 00:21:12,440
them I don't know how to interact with

577
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:15,259
the flowers yet but here's a really good

578
00:21:15,259 --> 00:21:17,149
example of using that this is actually a

579
00:21:17,149 --> 00:21:20,539
gallery piece come on play here we go

580
00:21:20,539 --> 00:21:22,190
this is called the treachery of

581
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:24,740
sanctuary by Chris milk and you would

582
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:27,590
have these sort of monolithic mirror

583
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:29,960
projections and as you extend your arm

584
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,850
it takes the geometry of your arm and

585
00:21:31,850 --> 00:21:33,470
extends it out into wings so this is

586
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:35,600
taking like a small scrap of geometry

587
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,070
and making it something bigger and more

588
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:39,860
expressive this is great cuz like you

589
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:41,360
don't need to be taught how to do this

590
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,129
it's just continuously like shifting

591
00:21:43,129 --> 00:21:47,120
what your arm means distribution this is

592
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,590
a really common one this is just like I

593
00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:50,990
have a bunch of stuff and I want to

594
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:54,169
scatter it around so you can think of

595
00:21:54,169 --> 00:21:55,879
how things are scattered in nature so

596
00:21:55,879 --> 00:21:56,899
like go outside and look at the lava

597
00:21:56,899 --> 00:21:58,370
fields and like see how rocks are

598
00:21:58,370 --> 00:21:59,750
clustered around other rocks and then

599
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:03,019
the moss is clustered around those there

600
00:22:03,019 --> 00:22:04,519
are really interesting things to do with

601
00:22:04,519 --> 00:22:06,919
generativity in distribution in like

602
00:22:06,919 --> 00:22:09,139
alternate reality games so if you have

603
00:22:09,139 --> 00:22:10,610
something like Pokemon go how are the

604
00:22:10,610 --> 00:22:12,830
monsters scattered around the world like

605
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:13,620
what logics are you

606
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:16,080
using for that you could have what they

607
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,309
do which is like where there's more foot

608
00:22:17,309 --> 00:22:18,420
traffic we're gonna scatter more

609
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:20,970
monsters you could say like in every

610
00:22:20,970 --> 00:22:22,380
piece of land that was taken by Native

611
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:24,150
them taken from Native Americans like

612
00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:26,130
before 1900 we're going to put the

613
00:22:26,130 --> 00:22:27,690
monsters there and you're going to

614
00:22:27,690 --> 00:22:29,640
actually like see where the landscape

615
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:32,730
was defined so you can like make

616
00:22:32,730 --> 00:22:35,670
different choices about distribution you

617
00:22:35,670 --> 00:22:36,900
know where do you want to put things in

618
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:38,550
your world is it where there's more

619
00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:40,140
pollution less pollution more people

620
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:42,000
less people more to car traffic less car

621
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,360
traffic particles in simulation I do a

622
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,620
lot of stuff with particles just because

623
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:49,260
it's like it's my personal favorite tool

624
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:51,590
so the the body's up there actually

625
00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:53,400
particles that are being pushed around

626
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,770
by the music so imagine like you created

627
00:22:55,770 --> 00:22:58,200
dance because you have a little sentient

628
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,400
Tribble on your wrist and every time it

629
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:02,070
hears a bass beat it does that and like

630
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:04,830
you'd do another one like and then you

631
00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:06,450
would apply those to your hips so you

632
00:23:06,450 --> 00:23:07,530
can kind of like create little dances

633
00:23:07,530 --> 00:23:10,050
out of that the one on the bottom left

634
00:23:10,050 --> 00:23:11,700
is Boyd's flocking which is like how you

635
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:13,500
create flocks of things that stay

636
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:15,690
together what can you do with that well

637
00:23:15,690 --> 00:23:17,640
you can leave trails behind it so these

638
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:19,230
are actually little particles that are

639
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:21,150
zooming around with their little physics

640
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:23,520
pushes and I'm leaving trade trails

641
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:24,750
behind them and that creates these kind

642
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:27,990
of interesting 3d flowers I really

643
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:29,190
wanted to mention machine learning just

644
00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:30,660
because like what do you do with machine

645
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:32,820
learning well it's another part of the

646
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:34,740
pipeline so remember how I talked about

647
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:36,150
we're turning curves into other things

648
00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:37,890
this is you tell the user to draw a

649
00:23:37,890 --> 00:23:40,230
couple of curves and then you are going

650
00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:41,490
to run a little machine learning thing

651
00:23:41,490 --> 00:23:43,410
on it that for every pixel tries to make

652
00:23:43,410 --> 00:23:45,110
it look as much like a cat as possible

653
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:47,400
and just kind of iterative like for this

654
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,410
patch of pixels how do I like sort of

655
00:23:49,410 --> 00:23:51,660
wobble the pixels such that they look as

656
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:54,090
much like a cat as possible so this is

657
00:23:54,090 --> 00:23:58,320
like procedural cat wobbling to generate

658
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,820
that sort of thing you can use it for

659
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:01,380
more serious stuff this is Alex Hoffman

660
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:03,720
dard who's got a start-up now which is

661
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:06,260
trying to do artistic stuff with

662
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:08,550
interactive machine learning where you

663
00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:11,550
can like color in sort of mspaint style

664
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:13,650
and then it will just like it with the

665
00:24:13,650 --> 00:24:15,270
cats waggle the pixels until it looks as

666
00:24:15,270 --> 00:24:18,809
much like it thinks Monet should look so

667
00:24:18,809 --> 00:24:20,309
yeah like a little bit I wanted to talk

668
00:24:20,309 --> 00:24:21,780
a little bit at least about JavaScript

669
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:23,940
because it's got a lot of features that

670
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:25,440
are really well suited for generativity

671
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,130
I used to do processing

672
00:24:27,130 --> 00:24:30,520
then our about 2012 I got contracted to

673
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:31,990
teach a class in JavaScript so then I

674
00:24:31,990 --> 00:24:34,090
had to learn JavaScript and then I got

675
00:24:34,090 --> 00:24:36,010
into processing yes and that was just a

676
00:24:36,010 --> 00:24:38,020
huge life changer because I love the

677
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:40,540
functional programming stuff so you can

678
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:44,590
like new maps and filters and reduces so

679
00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:46,720
it's all like it's a pipeline sort of

680
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:49,570
thing actually works with kind of

681
00:24:49,570 --> 00:24:53,860
different options in in JavaScript where

682
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:55,360
like you know you might have a user

683
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:56,890
gesture and you're gonna turn that into

684
00:24:56,890 --> 00:24:58,690
curves and then you're going to turn

685
00:24:58,690 --> 00:25:00,670
those curves into like different stamped

686
00:25:00,670 --> 00:25:03,550
shapes or styled curves in some way you

687
00:25:03,550 --> 00:25:05,020
might have particles doing like a

688
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:07,030
particle physics simulation you can turn

689
00:25:07,030 --> 00:25:09,030
those into curves or into stamped shapes

690
00:25:09,030 --> 00:25:11,710
any one of those might turn into u3 dot

691
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:13,300
J's models or they might turn it through

692
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:15,970
like p5 canvas stuff or SVG you might

693
00:25:15,970 --> 00:25:18,310
take that p5 canvas thing and turn it

694
00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:21,580
into a PNG that you're using in 3GS so

695
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:23,190
here's like some physics sim that's

696
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:25,780
pushing particles around and turning

697
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:27,580
them into curves

698
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:29,470
here's physics that are like

699
00:25:29,470 --> 00:25:31,660
procedurally on kinking the curves that

700
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:34,330
the particles are making and then here's

701
00:25:34,330 --> 00:25:37,000
something where this project I did a 3GS

702
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,090
butterfly simulator and I'm using

703
00:25:39,090 --> 00:25:41,290
process I'm using particles and

704
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:42,760
processing to draw the wings that I'm

705
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:44,140
rendering to canvas that I'm sending

706
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:47,050
over to 3GS as my textures so you can

707
00:25:47,050 --> 00:25:49,360
really set up these wild chains there's

708
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:50,380
a whole bunch of different generative

709
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:52,660
libraries everything from dance rjs to

710
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:54,850
take music and give you numbers and if

711
00:25:54,850 --> 00:25:55,990
you have those numbers what are you

712
00:25:55,990 --> 00:25:56,770
gonna do with those numbers

713
00:25:56,770 --> 00:25:59,140
I don't know generate something Voronoi

714
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:01,210
I've made these like libraries called

715
00:26:01,210 --> 00:26:03,700
tracery and battery but you know you've

716
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:06,910
got s e-g canvas 3GS processing all

717
00:26:06,910 --> 00:26:09,760
different ways to output art and then I

718
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,410
really like how you can get different

719
00:26:11,410 --> 00:26:13,030
interfaces so you can make stuff with

720
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:15,160
Twitter data you can make stuff with big

721
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:17,350
data ap is something that I didn't

722
00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:20,050
mention here is like visualization is a

723
00:26:20,050 --> 00:26:22,390
form of generative art you are taking

724
00:26:22,390 --> 00:26:23,620
some data you are running some

725
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:26,050
interesting tools on it pop you know

726
00:26:26,050 --> 00:26:28,890
grammars or parameters or whatever and

727
00:26:28,890 --> 00:26:30,940
you're getting some interesting art out

728
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:32,020
of it

729
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:33,400
I like the leap motion even though it's

730
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,350
kind of on the downturn now it's like

731
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:36,670
unpopular because nobody could figure

732
00:26:36,670 --> 00:26:38,410
out what to do with it

733
00:26:38,410 --> 00:26:40,270
you can do mouse gestures you can do 3d

734
00:26:40,270 --> 00:26:41,739
printing API

735
00:26:41,739 --> 00:26:43,659
I don't know what people are gonna do

736
00:26:43,659 --> 00:26:46,419
with augmented reality but if you've got

737
00:26:46,419 --> 00:26:49,360
like I'm gonna scan this room and do

738
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:51,009
some augmented reality and stuff in it

739
00:26:51,009 --> 00:26:53,739
I'm gonna need generative art to figure

740
00:26:53,739 --> 00:26:55,090
out like what do I do with the table

741
00:26:55,090 --> 00:26:56,230
what do I do with the table that's got

742
00:26:56,230 --> 00:26:59,009
like that arrangement of glasses on it

743
00:26:59,009 --> 00:27:01,119
you know if I wanted to wait a

744
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:02,860
generative garden over this entire thing

745
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:05,080
there are processes I just showed you

746
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:07,090
that I could use to simulate interesting

747
00:27:07,090 --> 00:27:09,070
garden stuff but I could never have an

748
00:27:09,070 --> 00:27:11,499
artist sit here and like dynamically

749
00:27:11,499 --> 00:27:12,820
figure out what everything is going to

750
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:15,100
be on every table and then 3d printing

751
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:16,690
api's which are fun but spoon flower

752
00:27:16,690 --> 00:27:18,070
which is the fabric printing one that I

753
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:20,470
did no longer has a direct API you can

754
00:27:20,470 --> 00:27:21,909
still upload stuff to it but like you

755
00:27:21,909 --> 00:27:24,039
can't have it dynamically respond to

756
00:27:24,039 --> 00:27:28,480
users actions oh yeah and that's the kid

757
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:32,919
using my idle hands thing so yeah in

758
00:27:32,919 --> 00:27:35,259
conclusion javascript has a lot of good

759
00:27:35,259 --> 00:27:37,899
features it has libraries plays well

760
00:27:37,899 --> 00:27:40,149
with unusual interfaces you can make

761
00:27:40,149 --> 00:27:41,590
something that makes something it's not

762
00:27:41,590 --> 00:27:43,720
hard to build these things what are the

763
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:46,210
swags that I brought with me is I made a

764
00:27:46,210 --> 00:27:48,759
bot and my bot makes art buttons or

765
00:27:48,759 --> 00:27:51,159
sorry stickers so if you've ever made an

766
00:27:51,159 --> 00:27:52,509
art bot or something that makes what you

767
00:27:52,509 --> 00:27:54,220
consider art come up to me and you can

768
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:56,139
totally get one of those stickers if you

769
00:27:56,139 --> 00:27:58,119
haven't come up to me later and I will

770
00:27:58,119 --> 00:27:59,590
show you how to use tracery and in five

771
00:27:59,590 --> 00:28:00,820
minutes you will have an art bot and

772
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:05,980
then a sticker so yeah
