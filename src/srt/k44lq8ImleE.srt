1
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:24,550

you

2
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:27,980
hi my name is Astrid first of all I want

3
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:30,080
to say how thrilled I am to be here and

4
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,180
thank you to the organizers for such an

5
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:34,580
amazing conference with such a great

6
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:36,410
number of speakers I've learned so much

7
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:39,860
too some last day and a half so my name

8
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:43,970
is Astrid and I'm meant to be starting a

9
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:47,540
PhD tomorrow but I'm at Jas comps so I

10
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:49,610
pushed it a week I'm actually starting

11
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:53,900
next week at Queen Mary in London my

12
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:56,989
area of specialization is media

13
00:00:56,989 --> 00:01:01,250
technology and that's my website Astra

14
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:04,040
been calm you can see the stuff I do and

15
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:07,730
on Twitter I'm disaster it and what I'm

16
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:10,010
gonna be talking about is how JavaScript

17
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:13,180
can influence how we tell stories

18
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:15,470
because I really feel that storytelling

19
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:17,960
is changing for the first time in about

20
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:20,180
well it's evolved over the last hundred

21
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:21,380
years but it's starting to go will

22
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:23,930
undergo a real change and JavaScript's

23
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:25,400
one of the technologies that can really

24
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:28,010
help with this or inform this this

25
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:29,630
change so that's what I'm gonna be

26
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:31,820
talking to you about today the first

27
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:35,420
things first I'm not a developer I know

28
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:37,189
most people who talk here are developers

29
00:01:37,189 --> 00:01:40,850
I'm not one of you but what I am is I'm

30
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:44,060
an artist a designer a researcher and a

31
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:46,939
writer and when I say research show me

32
00:01:46,939 --> 00:01:48,560
at such an ambiguous term but really

33
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,140
what I mean by that is noticing trends

34
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:52,719
and culture and noticing trends and

35
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:55,789
creative output and in culture in

36
00:01:55,789 --> 00:02:00,350
general and identifying where more work

37
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:03,579
can be done that's really what what I do

38
00:02:03,579 --> 00:02:05,450
everything I'm talking about today I'm

39
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:06,920
going to talk about two of my projects

40
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:09,200
and one project by somebody else that

41
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,540
I've never met but when I talk about my

42
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:12,200
projects

43
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,360
I'm not these projects aren't just by me

44
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:17,390
I actually work with a partner this is

45
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:21,080
Pete he is a developer some of you might

46
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:23,780
know him he's a front-end developer and

47
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:25,760
digital artist beat hockey he's my bike

48
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:26,990
we do a lot of creative work together

49
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:29,900
and you know we're also married but you

50
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:31,580
can find him at peat hockey comment on

51
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:34,730
Twitter as Pete of Republic and

52
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:38,150
we kind of work together in these sorts

53
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:39,920
of digital projects so that's what I'm

54
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,959
kind of gonna talk about today the first

55
00:02:41,959 --> 00:02:43,940
when we talk about storytelling we've

56
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:45,530
really got to talk about what where do

57
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:47,239
we get these ideas and what a story is

58
00:02:47,239 --> 00:02:49,670
and how a story works because my story's

59
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:50,989
been around since the beginning of time

60
00:02:50,989 --> 00:02:52,790
but we all understand stories in like

61
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:54,860
very specific ways and one of the

62
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:58,000
biggest influencers on that is of course

63
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,590
Hollywood and I know we all want to

64
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:01,940
thank well you know like Hollywood's not

65
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:03,470
you know the be-all and end-all of

66
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:04,790
stories but it has been the most

67
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:06,260
influential thing in the Western world

68
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:07,700
on storytelling in the last hundred

69
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:12,019
years and its advances in its own

70
00:03:12,019 --> 00:03:15,400
technology and it's a its creative

71
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,600
manipulation of that technology has been

72
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,280
really really influential so I'm gonna

73
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,049
talk about how the Hollywood model of

74
00:03:21,049 --> 00:03:22,370
storytelling is starting to break down

75
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:24,380
and where technologies like JavaScript

76
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:25,819
can kind of get in there and push

77
00:03:25,819 --> 00:03:28,549
forward and change how we use how we

78
00:03:28,549 --> 00:03:31,880
approach stories the Hollywood story

79
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:34,730
this I mean a million PhD theses can be

80
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:36,950
written on this topic of how Hollywood

81
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:37,940
tells stories so I'm gonna talk about

82
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:40,310
three really specific tiny little points

83
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:42,519
but this isn't by no means exhaustive

84
00:03:42,519 --> 00:03:44,690
first thing is that it with the

85
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:46,430
Hollywood model stories are meant to be

86
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:49,670
consumed in a specific venue and as also

87
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:52,130
that stories are consumed passively by

88
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:53,540
the audience that you see even when you

89
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:55,310
rent a movie or you download a movie and

90
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:56,540
you sit at home and watch it you're

91
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:57,829
sitting in front of a screen and it

92
00:03:57,829 --> 00:04:00,049
shows a bit of posture associated with

93
00:04:00,049 --> 00:04:01,880
it a physicality associated with it and

94
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,530
the third thing is that stories are

95
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:05,660
dependent on chronology and their

96
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:07,640
designs deliver an emotional response

97
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:10,310
and there's very specific reasons for

98
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:14,120
all these things and but right now what

99
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,039
we expect from stories and more

100
00:04:16,039 --> 00:04:17,870
importantly what counts as a story is

101
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:21,350
changing and when you have these three

102
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:23,600
elements of Hollywood storytelling

103
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,370
there's very they kind of break down to

104
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:28,700
three really simple ideas which is where

105
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:31,460
we experience stories how we experience

106
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:34,160
them and what purpose stories serve so

107
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,510
that's really the three elements that

108
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:36,979
I'm talking about and where they come

109
00:04:36,979 --> 00:04:40,250
from the first question is where where

110
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:43,039
do we consume stories in the Hollywood

111
00:04:43,039 --> 00:04:45,840
model and traditionally at

112
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:49,199
movie theater and there's always reasons

113
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:50,880
for these things and the reason for that

114
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,400
was because that's where the projector

115
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:56,280
lives and the whole idea I mean when I'm

116
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:58,470
you know looking at the the tradition of

117
00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:00,270
Hollywood I was like but that's crazy

118
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:02,070
that your technology lived in one

119
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:03,900
specific place in the center of town you

120
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:05,340
had to pay to go and look at it like

121
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:08,580
amazing because now the technology is

122
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:11,040
everywhere and this is one way that I

123
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:13,699
won really influential way that I think

124
00:05:13,699 --> 00:05:17,520
stories are starting to change the story

125
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,260
that the project I'm going to talk about

126
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:21,570
now is one that's very close to my own

127
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:23,370
heart it was a called the redemption

128
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:25,650
machines and redemption machines was a

129
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:28,800
pervasive media story that was told via

130
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,169
smartphone it was it was built in

131
00:05:31,169 --> 00:05:34,530
PhoneGap using javascript and what the

132
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:36,120
redemption machines was was a story

133
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,940
about man versus machine but it took

134
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:40,560
place in Belfast has anyone here ever

135
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,910
been to Northern Ireland is anyone ever

136
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:46,080
been to Belfast couple people now what

137
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,699
everybody knows about Belfast is that

138
00:05:47,699 --> 00:05:49,320
you know it's the trouble listen there's

139
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,970
been a civil war there for you know

140
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:53,669
decades but what people tend to forget

141
00:05:53,669 --> 00:05:55,620
even people that live there is that 200

142
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:58,320
years ago Belfast was the most it was

143
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,760
the wealthiest part of Britain and it

144
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,139
was actually the center of British

145
00:06:01,139 --> 00:06:03,389
technology and engineering and that was

146
00:06:03,389 --> 00:06:04,979
because of the industrial tradition in

147
00:06:04,979 --> 00:06:06,720
Belfast and now you look at you look at

148
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,039
the city and people that live there

149
00:06:08,039 --> 00:06:09,630
don't even notice this architecture

150
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:11,370
these incredible buildings that are left

151
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:14,970
over from this glittering industrial

152
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:17,130
past that everyone's forgotten about so

153
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:19,380
I developed this project called the

154
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:21,960
redemption machines and it was a story

155
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,880
that led the viewer around the city so

156
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:26,520
it used the story as a stage and it used

157
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,289
the buildings as players and it was an

158
00:06:28,289 --> 00:06:29,820
audio story that was delivered by

159
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:32,940
headphones and it was administered by a

160
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:38,070
smartphone so that is this is and if

161
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:41,280
there was no mobile phones this wouldn't

162
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,500
have been possible now I'm going to I've

163
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,419
made a short video for something else

164
00:06:45,419 --> 00:06:49,340
I'm actually going to show you now and

165
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:55,390
maybe I'll show you now here we go

166
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:59,419
remember when I had a cursor there it is

167
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:01,740
mission machines is a pervasive media

168
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:04,110
experience means that stands at the

169
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:06,120
intersection of fiction audio art

170
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,220
theater and game and allows the

171
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:09,810
participant to interact with their urban

172
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:11,790
surroundings in a new and meaningful way

173
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:14,250
it premiered in Belfast Northern Ireland

174
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:19,350
in May 2013 using Belfast existing

175
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:21,360
social and architectural history woven

176
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,280
into a fictional narrative the

177
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,750
redemption machines breathe life into

178
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:27,240
the urban terrain by activating Belfast

179
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,070
past glory days of industrialization

180
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:31,440
when mechanization changes city's

181
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,990
fortunes forever the story also

182
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:35,310
investigates the human-machine

183
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:37,530
relationship reflecting on what the

184
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:39,180
costs and benefits are of mass

185
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:41,520
production and mechanization on a grand

186
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:45,510
scale here's how it works the starting

187
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:47,120
point for the experience was a gallery

188
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,470
participants arrived at the gallery and

189
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:50,700
it was set up to look like a waiting

190
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:52,440
room and I was performing the role of

191
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,300
attendant they were issued with

192
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:56,370
headphones and a smartphone running a

193
00:07:56,370 --> 00:07:58,889
custom-designed app they sat down and

194
00:07:58,889 --> 00:08:00,030
tap the screen when they were ready

195
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:04,710
which triggered the audio story this

196
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:06,900
where you're standing is the membrane

197
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:09,390
place a place between the human and

198
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:11,760
machine worlds it's the world where the

199
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,770
walls are closing in a world whose

200
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:16,700
integrity is failing we need your help

201
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:18,810
there have been events that bring

202
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:20,640
machines and humans together too closely

203
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,650
the events going on at the moment it

204
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:24,870
happens are trapped here doomed to an

205
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:27,900
eternity of repetition the ghosts must

206
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:31,729
be released and the repetition must end

207
00:08:31,729 --> 00:08:34,140
the participant departs from the gallery

208
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:35,700
and moves around the city to a variety

209
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:38,010
of stop points checking in with the app

210
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:40,050
each time to receive a story's next

211
00:08:40,050 --> 00:08:42,839
chapter the first stop near the gallery

212
00:08:42,839 --> 00:08:45,360
is belfast oldest public building now a

213
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,180
disused eyesore it has not always been

214
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:50,130
this way and was originally used as a

215
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:51,990
meeting place for those made wealthy by

216
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:55,380
the products of industrialization if you

217
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:57,300
can stare past your own reflection you

218
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:00,270
can see an empty room there are ghosts

219
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:03,270
here and there having a party the ghosts

220
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:05,100
sip deeply from their bottomless glasses

221
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:06,900
of good drink and the scent of fresh-cut

222
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:08,720
flowers lingers in the air

223
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,720
the sunlight comes through the window

224
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,100
these ghosts were once human beings

225
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:15,110
raised to the upper classes by the

226
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:17,480
machines they commandeered steam power

227
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:19,280
somewhere else does the work for them

228
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:21,560
and the humans that stoke those great

229
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:24,310
fires live a very different existence

230
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:28,280
but now just look at them twirling and

231
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:30,350
eating having the same conversation

232
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:36,530
dance begins again not far away's bridge

233
00:09:36,530 --> 00:09:39,080
street an unremarkable thoroughfare that

234
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,880
sustained a direct bombing hit during

235
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,130
World War two during which Belfast

236
00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:44,930
suffered the highest numbers of civilian

237
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:49,150
casualties in the UK outside of London

238
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:50,780
starting at 10:00 p.m.

239
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:52,820
wave after wave of landmines and

240
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:55,190
incendiary explosives rained down on the

241
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:59,270
city the planes kept coming Bridge

242
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:00,920
Street where you are standing was

243
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:03,710
obliterated by a direct hit this was a

244
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:06,140
high-density working-class area reduced

245
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:09,890
to dust and rubble humanity had learned

246
00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:11,780
to fully wield machines as weapons of

247
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:14,540
war as instruments of mass destruction

248
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:18,920
so that was the Redemption machines it

249
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:21,440
was something that allowed the viewer to

250
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,630
stand in the environment of the story

251
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:26,510
world and this is not this is kind of

252
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:28,820
goes against this what one of the most

253
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:29,960
exciting things about mobile technology

254
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:33,200
I think is the ability to place viewers

255
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,210
within the story world instead of having

256
00:10:35,210 --> 00:10:37,010
to look at a screen that's a window to a

257
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:40,210
fictional world and uncoupling the

258
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:42,530
storytelling experience from the theater

259
00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:44,660
from a from a seat is I think that's

260
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:46,010
something that is really important and

261
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:48,380
that was built in PhoneGap I wrote it

262
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:50,210
recorded it produced it design the

263
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:53,390
interface and Pete implemented it in

264
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:56,960
PhoneGap using the PhoneGap API I know

265
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,580
everyone has diverging opinions on

266
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:00,500
PhoneGap but without PhoneGap that

267
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:03,890
wouldn't been possible just let me how

268
00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:07,970
do you even so that's the redemption

269
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:10,760
machines the other thing that I'd like

270
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:16,040
to talk about is how we how we confront

271
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,660
stories how we consume them and

272
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:20,870
traditionally the audience sits in a in

273
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:21,509
a

274
00:11:21,509 --> 00:11:24,029
you know in a theater seat and watches a

275
00:11:24,029 --> 00:11:25,889
movie and passively consumes it we're

276
00:11:25,889 --> 00:11:27,449
supposed to have this sort of you know

277
00:11:27,449 --> 00:11:29,339
emotional experience with the roomful of

278
00:11:29,339 --> 00:11:32,579
strangers and however one thing that

279
00:11:32,579 --> 00:11:33,899
I've been really interested in is how

280
00:11:33,899 --> 00:11:35,699
the audience how the person is

281
00:11:35,699 --> 00:11:38,639
experiencing the story can influence it

282
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:41,999
and the reason traditionally is because

283
00:11:41,999 --> 00:11:44,009
the story's independent of the audience

284
00:11:44,009 --> 00:11:46,800
and it happens to them so started

285
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,300
playing with how the audience can happen

286
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:51,300
to the story and now the story can

287
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:53,040
respond to the viewer and this is one

288
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,420
thing that I've been really interested

289
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:56,699
in with browser games actually and there

290
00:11:56,699 --> 00:11:58,379
was one thing that Pete and I again

291
00:11:58,379 --> 00:12:01,559
produced for a Microsoft Game Jam called

292
00:12:01,559 --> 00:12:03,360
Dark Tower we wanted to produce an

293
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,399
audio-only game and I realize I'm

294
00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:07,110
showing you a bunch of audio stuff so

295
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:08,160
you're just listening to me like blah

296
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,499
blah blah this whole time so it's bear

297
00:12:10,499 --> 00:12:14,790
with me but Dark Tower was a game that

298
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:17,100
has almost no interface and it's all

299
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:20,509
audio and the idea was to create a

300
00:12:20,509 --> 00:12:23,100
immersive audio environment and we did

301
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:26,040
this with the library buzz jas which

302
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:30,230
allows you to turn on and off various

303
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:34,679
audio files as in response to events so

304
00:12:34,679 --> 00:12:36,749
what I will do is I will show you a

305
00:12:36,749 --> 00:12:40,139
little bit of Dark Tower Dark Tower is

306
00:12:40,139 --> 00:12:42,569
played in the browser and the whole idea

307
00:12:42,569 --> 00:12:44,999
is that this is atmospheric and as you

308
00:12:44,999 --> 00:12:46,920
the ideas that you wake up in the top of

309
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:48,059
the tower and you've got to find a way

310
00:12:48,059 --> 00:12:49,319
to make it down to the bottom but you

311
00:12:49,319 --> 00:12:50,610
can't see anything you can only listen

312
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:52,709
and each you know it's kind of a horror

313
00:12:52,709 --> 00:12:55,379
story so each room has its own like

314
00:12:55,379 --> 00:12:57,959
gross things you only experience by

315
00:12:57,959 --> 00:13:04,170
audio but I'll show you a little bit now

316
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:08,660
you wake up in a room it's dark your

317
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:11,120
head hurts the taste of blood is in your

318
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:14,750
mouth your lips are cracked something is

319
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:17,269
poking into your back you are crumpled

320
00:13:17,269 --> 00:13:18,949
on a metal bed frame that is pushing

321
00:13:18,949 --> 00:13:21,860
that springs into your body you become

322
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:23,449
aware of something on your face

323
00:13:23,449 --> 00:13:27,589
something wet it's water leaking from

324
00:13:27,589 --> 00:13:30,230
somewhere above you you can hear a storm

325
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:33,050
outside rain falling on the roof the sky

326
00:13:33,050 --> 00:13:36,470
feels close from where you are as you

327
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:38,420
feel your vision fight for focus you are

328
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:41,720
alarmed you can see nothing you wake

329
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,910
your hand in front of your face nothing

330
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:47,139
a moment to panic have you gone blind

331
00:13:47,139 --> 00:13:49,370
you turn your head to the side and

332
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:51,439
detect a shift between shades black on

333
00:13:51,439 --> 00:13:53,750
the wall you realize you're not blind

334
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:56,600
you're just in complete darkness you

335
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,459
experience a moment of clarity and your

336
00:13:58,459 --> 00:14:00,379
confusion gives way to a feeling that

337
00:14:00,379 --> 00:14:05,329
seems primal old it's fear why are you

338
00:14:05,329 --> 00:14:08,149
here how did you get here you shiver as

339
00:14:08,149 --> 00:14:09,649
you realize you're wearing pajamas that

340
00:14:09,649 --> 00:14:12,490
have been dripped on for some time

341
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:15,680
adrenaline floods your limbs panic grips

342
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,930
your heart you're overcome with a desire

343
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:21,500
to get out of here but how the fear

344
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,089
bubbles up inside you and you want to

345
00:14:23,089 --> 00:14:25,699
yell out shout into the darkness maybe

346
00:14:25,699 --> 00:14:30,350
someone will hear you and help now

347
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:31,579
there's a choice do you want to shout

348
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:33,199
help hello or is there anybody there

349
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:41,519
what do you think is there anybody there

350
00:14:41,529 --> 00:14:43,720
there's no response so each time you

351
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:46,399
experience an event in dark tower you

352
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:48,350
want to move you want to get out of here

353
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:50,750
each time you get you get a choice in

354
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:53,120
dark tower the audience the audio shifts

355
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,910
and especially as you move down through

356
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:58,160
the tower the audio environment of each

357
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:01,339
room shifts and fades in and out and all

358
00:15:01,339 --> 00:15:03,290
of that is done by amplifying and

359
00:15:03,290 --> 00:15:05,089
attenuating very and fading in and

360
00:15:05,089 --> 00:15:07,040
fading out various tracks as it's about

361
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,620
I think is that there's about 50 tiny

362
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:11,329
audio tracks involved in that whole

363
00:15:11,329 --> 00:15:14,779
thing so it's this concert of audio

364
00:15:14,779 --> 00:15:16,699
tracks that is all controlled by buzz

365
00:15:16,699 --> 00:15:18,410
Jay yes and a great thing is that

366
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:21,680
because it's not one long audio track it

367
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:26,680
can really respond to the to the viewers

368
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:28,790
actions and button presses hang on a

369
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:30,860
second I've lost it I've lost a cursor

370
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:37,010
there it is so that was Dark Tower and

371
00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:38,600
as I said like usually when you produce

372
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,850
audio it's it's you have all of these

373
00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:42,199
different discrete tracks and you mix

374
00:15:42,199 --> 00:15:44,089
them all down to one track whereas with

375
00:15:44,089 --> 00:15:46,760
buzz Jay s what we did was we had all of

376
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:48,350
these different tracks going on at once

377
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:50,089
and depending on the events that happen

378
00:15:50,089 --> 00:15:52,190
through the viewer you they turn on and

379
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:54,709
off they fade in and out so this was

380
00:15:54,709 --> 00:15:55,850
great to create like a really

381
00:15:55,850 --> 00:15:57,949
atmospheric and rich audio environment

382
00:15:57,949 --> 00:15:59,930
and it's also the best part it's really

383
00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:03,680
easy to edit if you have one mix down

384
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,060
track if you need to make a change

385
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:06,980
you've got to like go back into the da W

386
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:08,600
inline-6 a little bit and then mix it

387
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,310
all down again and export it whereas

388
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:13,100
this you can change just a little bit if

389
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:15,260
like the beginning part there that I was

390
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:16,850
showing you I think there were seven

391
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:19,130
audio tracks playing at that point but

392
00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:20,630
you know there's a wind there's a

393
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:23,600
mechanical roar there's the rain there's

394
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,920
the vocal there's like all this stuff

395
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:27,529
going on and if you want to change or

396
00:16:27,529 --> 00:16:29,779
adjust any of that environment you only

397
00:16:29,779 --> 00:16:31,130
have to change you only have to edit one

398
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:33,440
little track put it back into the put it

399
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,870
back into the app and then it accepts

400
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:38,720
that change so that was what Dark Tower

401
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,100
and that was something that I was really

402
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:43,010
inspired by audio wise was this idea of

403
00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:46,240
being able to respond to audience events

404
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,260
the last thing I'm going to talk about

405
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:52,110
is what purpose we what purpose there is

406
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:56,430
with stories and stories were have

407
00:16:56,430 --> 00:16:57,900
always been used by Hollywood in a very

408
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:59,400
specific way and a lot of those reasons

409
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,380
are economical is that they want to sell

410
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:02,910
tickets so there was this idea of using

411
00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:05,459
a story as an emotional experience that

412
00:17:05,459 --> 00:17:06,959
you need to experience in a specific

413
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:09,150
place in a specific way and the reason

414
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:10,440
you did that is because want people to

415
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:12,420
sell tickets to buy tickets to have that

416
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:14,370
experience there's a lot of economical

417
00:17:14,370 --> 00:17:16,350
reasons behind why we've been

418
00:17:16,350 --> 00:17:18,120
experiencing stories in this way for the

419
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:20,339
love all through the 20th century and

420
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:21,089
even till now

421
00:17:21,089 --> 00:17:24,540
and so what counted as a story was a

422
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:26,640
story with conflict that elicits an

423
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,839
emotional response

424
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:30,210
now if anyone's interested in movies or

425
00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:31,410
you're interested in the story telling

426
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:33,120
is there 100 Joseph Campbell's everyone

427
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,850
know Joseph Campbell he wrote yeah he

428
00:17:35,850 --> 00:17:37,050
wrote this book called the hero with a

429
00:17:37,050 --> 00:17:38,670
thousand faces and if you're at all

430
00:17:38,670 --> 00:17:40,740
interested in writing or stories or

431
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:43,020
screenplays or movies read this book

432
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,790
because what Joseph Campbell did he was

433
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:46,920
a sociologist who and a comparative

434
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:49,020
literature expert and he went and looked

435
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:51,780
at stories from like ancient myths like

436
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:54,480
Beowulf and like you know oral history

437
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,340
myths all the way up to Hollywood movies

438
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:58,890
in the 20th century and he picked out

439
00:17:58,890 --> 00:18:01,560
what are the parts what are the things

440
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:03,570
in stories that human beings respond to

441
00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:06,570
and his ideas were taken on board

442
00:18:06,570 --> 00:18:08,820
completely by Hollywood and really have

443
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:10,140
influenced the way that Hollywood

444
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:12,090
structure stories there's always a hero

445
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:15,480
who has a quest and then he gets starts

446
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:16,710
the quest and someone gives him

447
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:18,330
something and then he goes on the quest

448
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:20,220
and he has this big ordeal he might meet

449
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:21,660
people along the way then he enters the

450
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:23,040
belly of the beast by himself and he

451
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,660
overcomes it and then he returns this

452
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:26,790
hero thing and this is true from like

453
00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:29,250
you know Beowulf

454
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:31,800
to Gone with the Wind to the matrix to

455
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:34,740
Wizard of Oz this this model of stories

456
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:38,460
is very very pervasive and so but these

457
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:39,780
stories have always been used by

458
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:41,430
Hollywood to sell tickets right there

459
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:43,170
and that there's an emotional response

460
00:18:43,170 --> 00:18:44,550
there that's what the audience is

461
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:46,710
getting is this emotional experience in

462
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:49,860
a very specific context and all of that

463
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:52,880
is there's very clear economic reasons

464
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,500
but now stories are not only used for

465
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,600
emotional response and not only used to

466
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,810
communicate these like you know

467
00:18:59,810 --> 00:19:02,880
chronological events but also they can

468
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,980
be applied to all sorts of things and

469
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:08,340
were uncoupling stories from this light

470
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:10,679
really stories are appearing everywhere

471
00:19:10,679 --> 00:19:12,690
they're not only delivered to us by you

472
00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:15,929
know media giants there's stories can be

473
00:19:15,929 --> 00:19:17,340
applied to all kinds of interesting

474
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:18,900
things and when you think about

475
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:21,090
chronological events what struck me when

476
00:19:21,090 --> 00:19:22,530
I started thinking about like alright

477
00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:23,910
well what is the story if it's a series

478
00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:25,860
of chronological events then lots of

479
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:27,510
things or stories instructions or

480
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:30,210
stories methods or stories procedures or

481
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:33,120
stories and so what is it that that you

482
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,530
know makes those things different or how

483
00:19:34,530 --> 00:19:37,260
can we bring story elements to a set of

484
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:39,299
instructions to make them more

485
00:19:39,299 --> 00:19:43,440
interesting or more appealing and one of

486
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,059
the most beautiful examples I've seen of

487
00:19:45,059 --> 00:19:47,030
this is something called Penguin Navi

488
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:50,400
this was a project that was done in

489
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:54,360
Japan and I'm just going to show you the

490
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:56,640
video because I don't even think I can

491
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:01,110
explain it this is Tokyo 35 year old

492
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:04,679
aquarium here there are so many

493
00:20:04,679 --> 00:20:08,580
thousands of things to do even worse the

494
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:10,679
aquarium is almost a kilometer from the

495
00:20:10,679 --> 00:20:13,770
station but that was our job we had to

496
00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:16,080
attract the visitors the aquarium and

497
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:20,610
make sure they could find it idea let

498
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:22,880
banelings bring people to the aquarium

499
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:26,059
so we created GPS penguin

500
00:20:26,059 --> 00:20:30,229
by using a our GPS Penguins will show

501
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:33,169
you the way to the aquarium oh you

502
00:20:33,169 --> 00:20:37,090
people can't help but to follow them

503
00:20:37,090 --> 00:20:40,299
what an amazing sense of road direction

504
00:20:40,299 --> 00:20:43,639
we human beings are magically drawn to

505
00:20:43,639 --> 00:20:47,539
cute animals human instinct need new

506
00:20:47,539 --> 00:20:51,320
technology it was a world first motion

507
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:53,869
capture technology applied to penguins

508
00:20:53,869 --> 00:20:57,349
are GPS penguins walk exactly like real

509
00:20:57,349 --> 00:21:03,739
penguin genuine penguin movements are

510
00:21:03,739 --> 00:21:10,729
you deducing the serotonin that you must

511
00:21:10,729 --> 00:21:14,359
me result mobile phones change boring

512
00:21:14,359 --> 00:21:19,030
point-to-point travel into entertainment

513
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:21,920
just follow the penguin you won't notice

514
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:23,450
other distractions

515
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:25,940
you'll arrive at the aquarium's before

516
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:29,900
you know it look people continue coming

517
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:34,940
today with this ah

518
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:38,669
domination company GPS payments for hot

519
00:21:38,669 --> 00:21:45,769
topic in many media

520
00:21:45,779 --> 00:21:51,470
emmalin's brought not only people

521
00:21:51,470 --> 00:22:02,900
but also smile now I saw that at a

522
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:06,440
conference recently has anyone ever seen

523
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:09,500
something so delightful I just thought

524
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:12,080
that was such an amazing way of applying

525
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,840
story to what is basically a procedure

526
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:17,840
and I found that I found that really

527
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,490
inspiring and I that really made me

528
00:22:19,490 --> 00:22:21,350
think like what what is it that you know

529
00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:22,940
we're actually telling what stories are

530
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:25,850
we telling and that was made with an AR

531
00:22:25,850 --> 00:22:27,679
authoring system called Mateo

532
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:30,440
M ETA IO I didn't put on the slide which

533
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:32,929
is really bad form of mine and what it

534
00:22:32,929 --> 00:22:35,929
is that is a custom browser called you

535
00:22:35,929 --> 00:22:36,320
neo

536
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:37,730
so I'm trying to get the presentation up

537
00:22:37,730 --> 00:22:40,780
but my cursor is not cooperating and

538
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:45,010
Mateo is based in Munich actually and

539
00:22:45,010 --> 00:22:47,840
they have various offices around the

540
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:50,120
world but their biggest offices in

541
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:52,429
Munich and it's an AR authoring system

542
00:22:52,429 --> 00:22:54,320
that uses JavaScript to glue together

543
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:57,289
the SDK and the HTML the logic is

544
00:22:57,289 --> 00:22:59,030
written in JavaScript and you also write

545
00:22:59,030 --> 00:23:02,900
they you style the GPS features like

546
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:04,850
bubbles that would appear on maps and

547
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:08,690
stuff like that with jf and you also use

548
00:23:08,690 --> 00:23:11,809
jf to listen for and handle events like

549
00:23:11,809 --> 00:23:14,510
screen tap and stuff like that and I was

550
00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:16,880
just blown away by this I mean first of

551
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,230
all I would follow that was penguins

552
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:22,159
into hell playa and but I thought what a

553
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:24,710
beautiful way of applying making this

554
00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:26,270
into a story except it's not a story

555
00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:27,799
with a beginning a middle and an end but

556
00:23:27,799 --> 00:23:29,780
there is a story there that where are

557
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:31,159
these penguins going why are they going

558
00:23:31,159 --> 00:23:32,270
there they're getting home like I've got

559
00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:34,490
I gotta go I gotta follow them and I

560
00:23:34,490 --> 00:23:36,159
thought that was such a beautiful way of

561
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:40,520
using applying a story to what is

562
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:43,429
generally just a procedure so what we

563
00:23:43,429 --> 00:23:45,409
expect from stories and what counts as a

564
00:23:45,409 --> 00:23:47,450
story is changing and and these are

565
00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:52,690
three ways that jss is doing this with

566
00:23:52,690 --> 00:23:54,799
enabling mobile I mean we can do all

567
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:56,390
these things with a number of a number

568
00:23:56,390 --> 00:23:58,159
of different technologies but these

569
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:01,070
three were done with gjs which is this

570
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:02,750
application done in PhoneGap which puts

571
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:04,740
the audience member in

572
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:07,770
the center of the imaginary world mixing

573
00:24:07,770 --> 00:24:12,360
mixing audio mixing various audio tracks

574
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:14,429
in order to create these atmospheric

575
00:24:14,429 --> 00:24:17,610
environments and also applying story and

576
00:24:17,610 --> 00:24:20,940
like whimsy and delight to a very boring

577
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:24,179
set of instructions so that's really all

578
00:24:24,179 --> 00:24:25,800
I have to say but this is where that's

579
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:26,640
that's me

580
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,890
Astrid Ben Esther Ben calm and on

581
00:24:28,890 --> 00:24:31,260
