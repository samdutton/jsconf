[Music]

2
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:25,160
hello hi yes

3
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:27,150
incredibly good to be back here

4
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:29,580
third time actually here at here in

5
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:31,650
Singapore I was here five years ago when

6
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:34,980
Thomas organized J s Camtasia was called

7
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:36,930
back then my name is Yong Yong boom

8
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:39,239
I am developer evangelist IOT at arm

9
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:42,420
arms the company that makes it basically

10
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:44,730
all the chipsets all the chips are in

11
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:45,539
your phones

12
00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:47,910
in a lot of the smart devices that you

13
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:50,100
might have in your house have ARM chips

14
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:54,390
in them and we're going to talk a little

15
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:56,550
bit about JavaScript and IOT I know that

16
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:59,879
this morning if we're talk from woman

17
00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:02,219
from tehsil we're gonna build on top of

18
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:05,100
that we're gonna take it one step

19
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:07,710
further we're not just gonna look at

20
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:11,130
okay how do I do my prototyping in

21
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:14,130
JavaScript but if we go from there how

22
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:16,680
can I run that application then on a

23
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:19,740
coin sell for multiple years which is a

24
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:23,189
challenge so when I propose this to to

25
00:01:23,189 --> 00:01:25,290
Thomas Thomas said this was me and

26
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:26,930
Thomas in Bali earlier this year

27
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:29,220
Thomas said yeah it's fine if you come

28
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:32,070
back but you need to bring lasers so

29
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:34,890
what we have in front of ear for lasers

30
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:37,380
that we're gonna utilize later in this

31
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:39,439
point and later at later in this talk

32
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:41,549
and hopefully I have something for you

33
00:01:41,549 --> 00:01:47,909
to take home as well so in the last five

34
00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:49,820
years I've seen JavaScript change a

35
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:51,770
tremendous bit

36
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:55,740
javascript has more or less and don't

37
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:57,420
ask me how it happened jobs get this

38
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:58,640
taken over the world

39
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,860
we we've seen JavaScript pop up

40
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:03,840
basically everywhere in the last few

41
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,790
years you know when I started

42
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:07,259
programming and this were in the days

43
00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:10,009
that Phoebe script was still a thing

44
00:02:10,009 --> 00:02:13,320
JavaScript first took over the browsers

45
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:15,640
then all of a sudden it started taking

46
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,560
over servers as well when we got no GS

47
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:20,050
and the situation that we're now in is

48
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:22,210
that is even making its way into the IOT

49
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:25,030
space two years ago or a year and a half

50
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:29,170
ago it's J's conf us we did a program

51
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:31,270
called node Rockets in which we

52
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:34,150
developed and builds senior just by

53
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:38,470
ourselves a rocket powered by JavaScript

54
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:41,110
videos that based on water power will

55
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:43,570
shoot up in the air write a JavaScript

56
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:46,210
program where we can verify whether it

57
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:48,910
was already going down when it goes down

58
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:50,800
deploy a parachute lengthen things

59
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,870
safely get a nice video everything had

60
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:54,460
happened as you might see from this

61
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:57,340
photo our rocket didn't completely work

62
00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:00,520
as planned but there was JavaScript

63
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,860
inside and the reason the JavaScript

64
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:05,920
gains momentum here around these kind of

65
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,870
solutions like I want to build something

66
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:09,910
connected or something smart that

67
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:11,710
doesn't even need a screen or doesn't

68
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:13,960
even it's not even mains powered it's

69
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,240
because it's easy to learn and because

70
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,070
there we can easily make a big community

71
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:21,190
around it you know we've seen libraries

72
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:25,120
like like Johnny Five with team boards

73
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,430
like tehsil they make it really easy to

74
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:29,350
leverage JavaScript leverage the amazing

75
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:32,080
community that is around javascript that

76
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,020
we might miss from traditional

77
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:36,130
programming languages traditional

78
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:38,650
programming methods for IOT devices and

79
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:40,900
see them here to quickly help us build

80
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:44,110
connected devices now typically these

81
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:46,300
these solutions including the the rocket

82
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:48,760
that we built run on a development board

83
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:51,970
like a recipe by a chip or maybe a

84
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:54,520
tehsil often using a library like Johnny

85
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,440
v the JavaScript robotics framework

86
00:03:56,440 --> 00:04:00,459
there many others the key is everything

87
00:04:00,459 --> 00:04:03,430
is built on top of no GS and that has a

88
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:06,700
number of really big downsides the most

89
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:08,830
important one is that well no GS is

90
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:13,720
desktop software right battery usage has

91
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:17,200
never been a concern no Jess's desktop

92
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,910
software running on desktop great

93
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:21,640
computers I can run a full desktop on a

94
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:25,120
Raspberry Pi so it means that

95
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,710
the two biggest downside that I see

96
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:30,880
there its first of all it's way over

97
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,850
powerful we're trying to do every time I

98
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:36,520
see an article on the interrupts where

99
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,050
basically someone says well I got this

100
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:40,000
super cool temperature sensor on a

101
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,120
recipe by three running yeah I wrote the

102
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,560
program in OGS the only thing that I'm

103
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,780
thinking at that point is well that

104
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:48,639
you're using a quad-core machine to run

105
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:50,830
a temperature sensor it's got this

106
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:54,070
computer good way around right and this

107
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:55,930
is bad if you if you want to go a little

108
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:57,940
bit further than just simple prototyping

109
00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:01,330
on one end it is equally expensive to

110
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:03,820
put a Raspberry Pi in everything runs

111
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:08,470
you $40 the other thing which is no I

112
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:12,419
think is is worse in that sense is that

113
00:05:12,419 --> 00:05:14,770
well look at look at battery usage

114
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:16,660
current consumption arrests replied

115
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:18,970
three in idle modes consumes 2 + or 20

116
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:23,590
milliamps of current if you if you told

117
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:25,330
me this a year ago or no idea what you

118
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:26,740
were talking about but let's compare it

119
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:28,660
if we want to run that rest free pie 3

120
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:30,940
for a year on a battery you know it's

121
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:32,950
not even a coin cell relatively powerful

122
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:34,840
this is the budget that we need to work

123
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:38,110
with we need to be sixteen hundred times

124
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:40,900
more efficient to run a recipe by three

125
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:44,789
off a battery than we can currently do

126
00:05:44,789 --> 00:05:51,749
can we do better

127
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:58,569
I bet you were expecting Obama here sure

128
00:05:58,569 --> 00:06:00,129
so let's look a bit at like how

129
00:06:00,129 --> 00:06:02,050
professional companies do that if I'm

130
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:05,110
building a real IT solution today what

131
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:07,509
am i using well this for example a

132
00:06:07,509 --> 00:06:09,669
Honeywell sensor temperature sensor that

133
00:06:09,669 --> 00:06:12,159
you put outside these weren't fine on

134
00:06:12,159 --> 00:06:14,080
batteries and if they've run fine on

135
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,830
batteries for many years the key here is

136
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:21,039
my controllers my controllers are really

137
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:22,870
tiny computers running on really really

138
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:27,339
tiny chips this is one this is a chip

139
00:06:27,339 --> 00:06:29,379
from Nordic semiconductors it's point

140
00:06:29,379 --> 00:06:30,849
six centimeters five point six

141
00:06:30,849 --> 00:06:33,129
centimeters that's a scale that we're

142
00:06:33,129 --> 00:06:34,870
thinking about this is a development

143
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:36,669
board for that ship this little thing

144
00:06:36,669 --> 00:06:37,960
you can't even see it from the audience

145
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:40,509
that is responsible for all computing it

146
00:06:40,509 --> 00:06:43,899
combines the MCU it combines RAM and

147
00:06:43,899 --> 00:06:45,550
combines flash storage and a Bluetooth

148
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:47,740
chip in a half centimeter by a half a

149
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:53,050
centimeter it's insanity but you know

150
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:55,270
it's a trade-off yes they're small and

151
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:57,520
yes they are cheap typical mic

152
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,560
controllers run one dollar two dollars

153
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,939
very easy to integrate in your own

154
00:07:00,939 --> 00:07:02,680
design but it has a trade-off

155
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:05,020
I can't run Linux on of it Linux on it I

156
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:06,639
can't run another operating system on it

157
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:09,370
the cons run v8 on it so that means that

158
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:11,949
no GS is kind of out of the question the

159
00:07:11,949 --> 00:07:13,569
way they're not powerful enough for that

160
00:07:13,569 --> 00:07:17,919
a powerful mic controller will maybe

161
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:20,110
have 80 megahertz of processor speeds

162
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:26,009
and 64 kilobytes of RAM you know and

163
00:07:26,009 --> 00:07:28,689
with with a lack of power also comes a

164
00:07:28,689 --> 00:07:33,189
lack of ecosystem because it's hard as a

165
00:07:33,189 --> 00:07:37,029
program then it's C++ it's assembly that

166
00:07:37,029 --> 00:07:38,589
means that we don't get a nice ecosystem

167
00:07:38,589 --> 00:07:43,659
around that we have with JavaScript sort

168
00:07:43,659 --> 00:07:45,639
of got me thinking I've been I've been

169
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:47,199
toying with the idea of JavaScript and

170
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:49,959
connected devices for the past two three

171
00:07:49,959 --> 00:07:53,409
years and in a way I want best of all

172
00:07:53,409 --> 00:07:56,379
worlds I want two cheap designs of a

173
00:07:56,379 --> 00:08:00,099
microcontroller I want the easy way of

174
00:08:00,099 --> 00:08:03,189
integrating that into my own designs but

175
00:08:03,189 --> 00:08:05,620
also love to have a vibrant and

176
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:07,660
community around that similar to what we

177
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:09,250
can currently do in the know GS

178
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:13,330
connected devices ecosystem wouldn't it

179
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:15,580
be amazing if you could run JavaScript

180
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:23,410
on these microcontrollers in arm we've

181
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:25,060
been thinking about ways of making my

182
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:26,620
controller development easier already

183
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:29,020
for about the last seven years so we we

184
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:30,790
developed a product called

185
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:33,130
embeds mr. program working on the day to

186
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:36,039
day basis well the first thing that we

187
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:37,419
wanted to do is make Mike control

188
00:08:37,419 --> 00:08:39,370
developing in general easier so we

189
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:41,380
created the ambit platform with over a

190
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:42,789
hundred board support that's two hundred

191
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:44,680
thousand developers you guys have no

192
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:45,730
idea what it is because you're not

193
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:49,330
embedded deaths but it also means that

194
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:50,980
we already have lots of api's libraries

195
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:53,560
and community around it's not enough

196
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:55,000
that's what I'm saying is if LR

197
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,740
evangelist I wanna want to have a bigger

198
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:58,930
community of course I want that you know

199
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:02,260
it's all in C++ and then game along Sam

200
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:03,480
Soon

201
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:07,480
Sampson developed a Jerry script is not

202
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,490
the official logo if you've seen

203
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:11,770
Seinfeld you understand the reference

204
00:09:11,770 --> 00:09:13,360
let's develop a Samsung and it's a

205
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,459
JavaScript VM for ultra constraint

206
00:09:15,459 --> 00:09:18,880
devices the Jerry's give VM unlike no GS

207
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,800
runs on Mike Rotolo the whole idea is

208
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,860
that it fits in 64 K of RAM and it's

209
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:26,740
written in Japanese he plus plus so I

210
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:28,240
figured if we can combine these two

211
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:32,740
projects we have a met on this side

212
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:35,230
making it super easy to program on my

213
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:36,580
controllers for a lot of different ones

214
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:39,010
so we don't need to port to a new market

215
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:41,380
role every time comes out we still have

216
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:43,390
the flexibility of JavaScript VM so

217
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:45,520
that's the project that there were that

218
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:48,730
was launched actually this morning and

219
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:50,110
worked really hard to get the website

220
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:51,730
out which is called JavaScript and

221
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:53,500
embeds and it combines the best of all

222
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:56,110
worlds of my controller development with

223
00:09:56,110 --> 00:10:00,100
JavaScript it combines the power to run

224
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:03,160
on little tiny boards like these and

225
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:06,450
this is a this is a microcontroller

226
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:10,300
under $2 retail price and they're two

227
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:11,470
dollars you can buy it in single

228
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:14,350
quantities as a Wi-Fi chip on board and

229
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:16,630
now can run JavaScript can run all your

230
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:19,510
programs that is freaking

231
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:22,060
awesome that is okay getting ahead of

232
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:25,840
myself so today we're releasing that we

233
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:28,750
runs on 40 different boards already so

234
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:30,100
you can just go to a website pick any of

235
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:31,950
those boards so my Wi-Fi so my bluetooth

236
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:35,050
all the critical parts drivers operating

237
00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:38,530
system etc are still written in C++ it's

238
00:10:38,530 --> 00:10:39,880
it's a project that's been has been

239
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,590
going for about seven years already so

240
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:43,210
we have stuff like deep sleep and have a

241
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:44,530
way of like putting your microcontroller

242
00:10:44,530 --> 00:10:48,190
in really really deep sleep states you

243
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:50,200
can leverage or C++ ecosystem around

244
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,210
it's in every connectivity methods your

245
00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:53,950
whole application code Korean JavaScript

246
00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:56,170
still take advantage of our stuff that

247
00:10:56,170 --> 00:10:57,940
we done on making it run efficiently

248
00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:00,960
making it go to sleep whenever possible

249
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:03,160
while still maintaining the flexibility

250
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:06,510
of writing your application in Jas so

251
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:08,860
this is one of the simple programs that

252
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:10,960
we have really easy how to override

253
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:14,020
blinky you start with cloning our sample

254
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:17,490
write a little bit of code run gulp

255
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:20,470
JavaScript stuff it creates a file and

256
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:22,330
you just drag the file onto your boards

257
00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:24,400
the development board mounts as a USB

258
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,230
mass storage device so you don't need

259
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:28,570
any drivers just drag and drop them

260
00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:32,890
application running nice flexible be

261
00:11:32,890 --> 00:11:35,710
aware if you think like yeah I want to

262
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:38,650
do this javascript is really really slow

263
00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:42,430
on this on these things raw performance

264
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:45,570
is about a hundred times slower than C++

265
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:47,830
but because we've written all the

266
00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:51,790
critical parts in C++ you know the boot

267
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:54,310
load our networking stacks basically

268
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:57,120
everything else that not your user code

269
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,040
efficiency is relatively good especially

270
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,030
if you sleep a lot

271
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:03,250
you can spawn out of JavaScript whenever

272
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:05,200
we need it we can run stuff in C++ in a

273
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,940
separate thread but this way we have

274
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:10,270
like a with a model where we have the

275
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:12,040
nice flexibility of Java scripts but

276
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:14,890
still can run stuff at native speed in

277
00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:17,350
C++ a bit similar how nodejs does that

278
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:22,720
on on Linux systems but it's through

279
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,480
microcontroller right yeah applications

280
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,650
code might run a bit slow but it's a

281
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:28,180
real microcontroller it's come with all

282
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:30,910
the benefits we can run this is one of

283
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:32,380
the development boards again this one

284
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:33,350
even as a

285
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:36,170
little coin cell holder welcomes a

286
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:37,850
little here and that's because it's

287
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:39,970
actually meant to run off a coin cell

288
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:42,110
using this approach we can write

289
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:43,520
JavaScript applications that run

290
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,530
straight on that absent members later it

291
00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:46,700
also allows you to do some really

292
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:50,210
interesting experiments the BBC micro

293
00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:52,820
bits is a low computer that's been given

294
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:56,240
to every 10 and 11 year old kid in both

295
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:59,420
the UK and ins and in Iceland now it is

296
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:02,900
how they learned blurt program as part

297
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:05,600
of their official primary school

298
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,130
curriculum it's really cool

299
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:09,020
all these kids like a million kids have

300
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:10,820
gotten like this little board and had

301
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:12,320
learned a program and by having an

302
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,240
abstraction layer on top of it on top of

303
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,550
like our native api's we can all of a

304
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:21,190
sudden have little simulators that run

305
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:23,530
sobriquet the program it in the browser

306
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:25,610
drag little blocks together we can

307
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:27,350
simulate it and after that we compile it

308
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:29,840
run it in our VM and all of a sudden

309
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:32,090
have the same experience on the device

310
00:13:32,090 --> 00:13:35,480
and here same thing we can do and this

311
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:38,600
simulator that comes with J's and embeds

312
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:41,380
I hacked it together in the plane here

313
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:44,720
so on top you see basically three three

314
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:47,210
LEDs toggling will run exactly the same

315
00:13:47,210 --> 00:13:48,980
on the board and then we can also fake

316
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:50,960
extra peripherals like the Bluetooth

317
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,490
stack so in this case you can connect I

318
00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:54,860
see what is happening if I could connect

319
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:57,290
my phone to the device and for example

320
00:13:57,290 --> 00:14:00,620
toggled toggle the LED year which I just

321
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:02,360
did so it's some really interesting

322
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:05,030
things some other stuff do we do is that

323
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:06,920
we abstract away many microcontroller

324
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:09,860
problems manual threat management

325
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:12,680
interrupts switching it's all abstracted

326
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:15,890
away behind the JavaScript event loop so

327
00:14:15,890 --> 00:14:17,120
even if you wanted to make like a real

328
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,250
product out of this having a JavaScript

329
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:20,800
abstraction on top of it is really nice

330
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,030
in the future what I would really like

331
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:24,500
to do is because we have everything in

332
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,120
the event loop automatic power

333
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:28,130
management just put the device to sleep

334
00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:29,240
you don't need to do anything you don't

335
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:31,070
need to call sleep we just realize oh

336
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:33,320
every second do this in between I'll go

337
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:36,350
to sleep and make everything magic so to

338
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:38,690
come back can we run this on on a on a

339
00:14:38,690 --> 00:14:40,760
coin cell right now yes

340
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:45,410
remember to 20 point 1 to 7 milliamp is

341
00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:47,030
the budget that we have you want to run

342
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:50,090
is one year in AAA battery these are

343
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:52,130
numbers of a JavaScript beacon with

344
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:54,080
Bluetooth on sending a message every

345
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:57,890
seconds broadcasting it outs her budget

346
00:14:57,890 --> 00:15:00,710
is point zero to a there's seven years

347
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:02,990
in an AAA battery and on a coincidence

348
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:05,720
out a year and a half that is freaking

349
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:10,100
impressive search how script yes thank

350
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:14,660
you so current States its released today

351
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:16,550
it's some embedded comm /cas

352
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:20,300
with 40 board support it's unfortunately

353
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:22,160
at the moment if you want to use C++

354
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,900
libraries we have about 6,000 of them

355
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:25,340
for basically every peripheral that

356
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:27,410
you'll find if you buy sensor if you buy

357
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:29,420
an actuator if you buy an accelerometer

358
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:32,600
ever we need a C++ binding right now I'm

359
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,160
hoping that someone here in the audience

360
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,630
will say yon of course I'm gonna help

361
00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:37,550
you with that because then we can

362
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:39,290
automate that shooting me to art it's

363
00:15:39,290 --> 00:15:42,560
Apache 2 license it's better but please

364
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,810
help us it's gonna be freaking amazing

365
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:46,910
I said everything available Emma thumbs

366
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:49,010
yes here's one of the things we can do

367
00:15:49,010 --> 00:15:53,630
with that whoo got lasers controlled

368
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:55,880
through JavaScript and I can do stuff

369
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,080
and I don't know if you can actually see

370
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,280
this from the audience because they're a

371
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,780
little bit less bright than I thought

372
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:03,050
but lasers JavaScript's all kinds of

373
00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:05,090
cool stuff runs on the coin cell if this

374
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:06,350
is not the future then I don't know what

375
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:12,410
is and with that I want to thank you all
