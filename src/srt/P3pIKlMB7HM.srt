[Music]

10
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:25,270
so a few years ago I was at the

11
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:28,000
barbershop it was my first time in there

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,529
my first the only time there so their

13
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:30,579
group of students over there waiting

14
00:00:30,579 --> 00:00:33,250
their turn and so I'm intensely focused

15
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:36,190
at the mirror it's gonna like this is

16
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:37,420
trying to figure out like is he cutting

17
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:40,149
my hair right yes he is but in the midst

18
00:00:40,149 --> 00:00:42,039
of those buzzing I heard a group of

19
00:00:42,039 --> 00:00:43,570
students talking about college

20
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:46,000
admissions Dartmouth Williams and all

21
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,340
these are the colleges and I'm thinking

22
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:50,890
to myself whoa I went to this school I

23
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:53,260
could so help suggestions things to

24
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:55,300
consider all this kind of advice I

25
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:56,739
wanted to give and since now I'm just

26
00:00:56,739 --> 00:00:59,140
like super excited like yes yes yes but

27
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:00,910
then it dissipates because I'm thinking

28
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:04,390
wait I don't know them they don't know

29
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:06,909
me yeah they got they still figured out

30
00:01:06,909 --> 00:01:09,939
on themselves so the haircuts done and

31
00:01:09,939 --> 00:01:12,270
as I'm walking out the barbershop I

32
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:15,820
freeze because all these memories come

33
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:17,650
rushing in like when I was at a coffee

34
00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:19,659
shop and I saw someone with an effective

35
00:01:19,659 --> 00:01:21,729
JavaScript book or when I was at the

36
00:01:21,729 --> 00:01:24,010
library and I saw someone with this ap

37
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:26,110
computer science book in each one of

38
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:27,970
those times I wanted to go up in them

39
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:30,280
and say hey JavaScript that's awesome

40
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,900
please what can I do can I do to help

41
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:33,790
AP Computer Science data structures

42
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:35,170
algorithms let's talk I'd love to talk

43
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:37,960
about those but I did it because I was

44
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:40,119
shy I was apprehensive a little bit

45
00:01:40,119 --> 00:01:43,180
embarrassed but I thought okay this has

46
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:45,430
to stop somewhere so I turned back

47
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:47,860
around introduce myself to the group of

48
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:50,380
students and said hey I'm get it please

49
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:51,520
feel free to reach out for anything I

50
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,049
can do to help with the college

51
00:01:53,049 --> 00:01:56,439
application process etc a few weeks

52
00:01:56,439 --> 00:01:58,930
later one of them did reach out and that

53
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:00,369
turned into this beautiful beautiful

54
00:02:00,369 --> 00:02:02,350
friendship he's now at the skov his

55
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:04,360
dreams pursuing pre-med on the path

56
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:07,119
towards becoming a neurosurgeon so by

57
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:09,280
the way I didn't go back to the barber

58
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,629
shop and I figured hey I could actually

59
00:02:10,629 --> 00:02:12,250
probably just cut my hair myself and

60
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:14,860
then this happened and then I'm like

61
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:18,189
okay let me start going back again so my

62
00:02:18,189 --> 00:02:19,569

00:02:19,569 --> 00:02:22,300

00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,340
it's an honor to pleasure thank you I'm

68
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:29,020
a developer I assumes working with react

69
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:31,150
node and Java to build the better

70
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:32,620
recruiting experience for both job

71
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:35,410
seekers and employers it's overall just

72
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:37,240
surrounded by great people doing good

73
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,710
work helping clients like Microsoft

74
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:41,460
Amazon 7-eleven South that the Airlines

75
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:45,700
Boys and Girls Club overall a blast but

76
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:48,070
really at the barbershop why did I have

77
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:52,030
to do that did I have to not really but

78
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:55,420
I wanted to and it was because deep in

79
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:57,310
my heart I know that I wouldn't be here

80
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:59,800
today without my mentors I wouldn't have

81
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,150
majored in computer science had I not

82
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:03,190
been from my mentors nor would I even be

83
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:05,080
the developer that I am today had it not

84
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:07,810
been for my mentors their encouragement

85
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:10,239
their resources their guidance they were

86
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:12,580
highly highly highly invaluable and

87
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:15,040
important to my life but more so what

88
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,690
they really taught me was just that a

89
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:19,450
candle loses nothing by lighting another

90
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:22,300
candle you know I believe that for our

91
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:25,270
community to be more inclusive more

92
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:26,980
collaborative and even more innovative

93
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:29,500
we need more mentorship and now there is

94
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,150
good progress being made already with

95
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:32,980
formal programs like when you're a new

96
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:35,200
hire or you're an intern and you meet

97
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,120
with someone on a regular basis I think

98
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,620
those are great and it's really good

99
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:41,920
progress that said I'm not here to talk

100
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,750
about that kind of mentorship I'm here

101
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:45,190
to talk about a mentorship that is more

102
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:49,330
organic it's more fluid but that said

103
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:51,610
there are some obstacles with mentorship

104
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:53,530
obstacles that I myself experienced

105
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:55,930
greatly so by raise of hands raise your

106
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:57,100
hands if you think if you consider

107
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:58,510
yourself a mentor or if you're like me I

108
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:00,280
do like the little halfsie hand or do

109
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,480
like a quick when I'm quick bring it

110
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:05,200
back down and the thing is at first I

111
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,810
didn't consider myself a mentor for many

112
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:10,540
reasons one I'm like I don't have the

113
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:14,160
time to I'm not part of a formal program

114
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:16,540
nor do I even really consider myself a

115
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:19,930
quote/unquote expert and frankly I was

116
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:21,519
it was quite intimidating I'm like those

117
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:23,950
are some big shoes to fill I mean one

118
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:26,320
what if I'm giving the wrong advice or

119
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,229
maybe I'm giving too much advice or if

120
00:04:29,229 --> 00:04:30,490
you really want to get to the crux of it

121
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:32,830
it was more of like I'm actually pretty

122
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:35,140
good why do I even need to or have to

123
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:37,629
help

124
00:04:37,639 --> 00:04:39,650
but mentorship is important and it's a

125
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:43,669
few reasons one of them helps them you

126
00:04:43,669 --> 00:04:45,740
know imagine the fulfillment knowing

127
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:46,729
that you helped someone with their

128
00:04:46,729 --> 00:04:50,330
career even if it's a teeny tiny bit or

129
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:51,469
what if you helped provide one of those

130
00:04:51,469 --> 00:04:54,259
aha moments with the tool or framework

131
00:04:54,259 --> 00:04:56,449
or a concept I still remember when

132
00:04:56,449 --> 00:04:57,740
someone explained the whole redoubts

133
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:00,050
flux architecture to me like oh okay I

134
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:02,300
see that's how that works I mean I will

135
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:03,560
never forget that day because for the

136
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,180
longest I was like I don't know what I'm

137
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:06,939
doing here but then it clicked

138
00:05:06,939 --> 00:05:11,449
at the same time mentorship helps us as

139
00:05:11,449 --> 00:05:11,930
well

140
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:14,210
it's by paying it forward we benefit in

141
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:16,009
different ways you know it's been times

142
00:05:16,009 --> 00:05:19,490
I remember so I was explaining the

143
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:21,770
JavaScript develop to someone and he

144
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:23,060
kept asking these questions it was this

145
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:24,770
back and forth then before I know it I

146
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:27,500
realized wow I don't know they said ah I

147
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:28,849
do not know this you've been looped at

148
00:05:28,849 --> 00:05:30,979
all which forced me to go out and go

149
00:05:30,979 --> 00:05:32,449
find some videos on how that literally

150
00:05:32,449 --> 00:05:34,400
works there's been other times we're

151
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,249
just hearing people's life experiences

152
00:05:37,249 --> 00:05:39,080
their perspectives on life has only made

153
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:42,169
my own worldview that much more dynamic

154
00:05:42,169 --> 00:05:46,069
and richer but more so I mean you get to

155
00:05:46,069 --> 00:05:47,900
make new friends a new ally and the

156
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:49,250
supporter we're just helping one another

157
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:51,379
we reach your own goals and your dreams

158
00:05:51,379 --> 00:05:54,560
all that good stuff but more so I'm a

159
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,449
big believer that are certain feelings

160
00:05:56,449 --> 00:05:59,060
and there are certain experiences that

161
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:00,740
money you really can't buy you could buy

162
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:02,509
a lot of really good things but it can't

163
00:06:02,509 --> 00:06:03,949
buy certain experiences and feelings

164
00:06:03,949 --> 00:06:06,669
that really only mentorship can provide

165
00:06:06,669 --> 00:06:09,110
and more so it just helps the community

166
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:11,389
I'm a big believer that what we put in

167
00:06:11,389 --> 00:06:14,149
we get out it's about raising these

168
00:06:14,149 --> 00:06:16,550
waters so that we're all uplifted

169
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:19,219
together more collaborative more

170
00:06:19,219 --> 00:06:22,460
innovative more inclusive and it's more

171
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:24,080
so it's like this ripple effect it's

172
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,279
this ripple effect where you affect

173
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:27,409
someone and they affect another and they

174
00:06:27,409 --> 00:06:29,120
affect another it's like a boomerang or

175
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,729
it's just like until before you know

176
00:06:31,729 --> 00:06:34,069
just like it just comes back with that

177
00:06:34,069 --> 00:06:35,870
helping return from nowhere or you won't

178
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:39,740
even have expected it growing up there's

179
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:42,050
a lot of things I wanted to do but one

180
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:44,210
of my goals is always to really make an

181
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:45,889
impact on this world how can I make the

182
00:06:45,889 --> 00:06:48,589
world a better place and well I still

183
00:06:48,589 --> 00:06:50,180
haven't come up with that solution that

184
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:51,300
would affect

185
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:54,120
millions tens of millions hundreds of

186
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:57,690
millions this quote the fact that maybe

187
00:06:57,690 --> 00:06:59,159
to the world I may just be one person

188
00:06:59,159 --> 00:07:02,190
but to one person I may be the world it

189
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:03,780
makes me realize that even if it's just

190
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:05,849
one person I'm affecting today I mean

191
00:07:05,849 --> 00:07:07,770
that's to me that's that's key and

192
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:10,289
that's important and you know throughout

193
00:07:10,289 --> 00:07:12,840
the course of my life I will forget many

194
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:15,240
many many things and I've already

195
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,110
forgotten many already

196
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:17,940
I've forgotten many names Africa and all

197
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:19,259
the places of all out of you people work

198
00:07:19,259 --> 00:07:21,860
at but the things I will always remember

199
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:24,719
are those who help me those stick with

200
00:07:24,719 --> 00:07:28,289
me so this is a mentorship I'm trying to

201
00:07:28,289 --> 00:07:30,509
talk about people need your help and you

202
00:07:30,509 --> 00:07:33,240
can help them you want to help them and

203
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,430
more so it also benefits you as well and

204
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:36,930
the thing is it doesn't have to be

205
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:38,669
stressful it doesn't have to be

206
00:07:38,669 --> 00:07:40,740
complicated it doesn't even have to be

207
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:43,500
so involved it's more about a mentorship

208
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:46,530
it's organic it's fluid to me it's

209
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:49,969
really more about sharing what you can

210
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:51,360
when you can

211
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:56,669
and how you can mentorship is like

212
00:07:56,669 --> 00:07:58,319
walking through a garden with the

213
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:00,060
watering jug and so you're walking

214
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:01,380
through a guarding and sure you can

215
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:03,389
choose one plant and come every morning

216
00:08:03,389 --> 00:08:07,080
to water it or you can pick and choose

217
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,819
walking through this garden here's some

218
00:08:08,819 --> 00:08:11,099
for you here's some for you oh here's a

219
00:08:11,099 --> 00:08:13,229
lot for you and you just pick and choose

220
00:08:13,229 --> 00:08:14,759
you can go the whole morning you can

221
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:17,430
spend the entire day in fact you could

222
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:19,080
go to a different garden altogether next

223
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:22,139
time and the thing is if you think it's

224
00:08:22,139 --> 00:08:24,300
a good thing just do it you don't have

225
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:27,300
to rationalize justify a reason about it

226
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:29,490
just go ahead and do it as long as

227
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:31,620
they're genuine sincere and honest

228
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:33,209
intentions to try to better someone's

229
00:08:33,209 --> 00:08:35,310
life I'm a big believer that just dive

230
00:08:35,310 --> 00:08:40,079
in so going back on this idea what would

231
00:08:40,079 --> 00:08:41,969
you actually share as a mentor you know

232
00:08:41,969 --> 00:08:43,529
how can I do this if I'm not a

233
00:08:43,529 --> 00:08:46,410
quote/unquote expert and that's the

234
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:47,730
thing you don't need to be and the

235
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:48,930
things you even share don't even have to

236
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:52,320
be related to tech you know what if you

237
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,660
could condense what took you five years

238
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:57,779
to figure out and package that and share

239
00:08:57,779 --> 00:08:59,670
with someone else so that they also

240
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:01,980
don't have to spend five years as well

241
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:04,290
you know it could be about knowledge and

242
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:06,690
experiences you know one of my favorite

243
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:08,490
things I've done this entire year was

244
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:10,980
just speaking at organizations like Rosa

245
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:14,040
code sharing my experiences in how in my

246
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:17,400
journey the tech I used to ask myself do

247
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:20,190
I belong am I good enough am i

248
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:21,930
passionate enough I really like this

249
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:26,430
field and hearing their responses you

250
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:29,190
know those eyes lit up high school

251
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:31,200
junior and senior girl just talked

252
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,940
telling me stories of how they also felt

253
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:34,800
the same way and how they were relieved

254
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,420
that they weren't the only ones feeling

255
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:38,040
this way I mean to me I was like nah

256
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:41,490
just give me the one fuzzies and the

257
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:43,170
thing is perhaps you know the thing

258
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:46,200
about a framework or to service three

259
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:49,050
dogs all different kinds of things maybe

260
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:51,060
you can share that or maybe you can talk

261
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:52,590
about the obstacles you faced on your

262
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:54,510
journey to here and tell them about hey

263
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:56,340
watch out for that tree why don't you

264
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:58,140
make a left on that turn you don't want

265
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:01,380
to go that way go this way instead the

266
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:02,850
type of advice you give could also be

267
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:05,670
both general or specific I myself I

268
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:08,220
personally enjoy talking about though I

269
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:09,720
personally do mentoring those who are

270
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,760
both entering or switching to the tech

271
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,590
industry and also about applying

272
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:16,140
psychology to our daily day but on the

273
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:17,400
other hand I have a friend who just oh

274
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,710
man he just you could talk for hours and

275
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:21,630
hours and hours on end about

276
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:23,310
surveillance architecture and Lando's

277
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:25,020
and all of that so if you want that kind

278
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:27,240
of you just go to him I have another

279
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,890
friend on the other hand who just who

280
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:30,690
really makes yourself available to new

281
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:32,130
joiners when they're learning the code

282
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:33,960
base so there's different ways we can do

283
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:36,540
it perhaps you were a developer and now

284
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:38,460
you're a manager you can give that kind

285
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:40,590
of advice your experiences or your now

286
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:44,850
you're a dev from to a team lead more so

287
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:46,350
I mean I even saw someone tweeting about

288
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:48,180
performance reviews and advice that

289
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:52,410
consider when that time comes you know

290
00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:54,990
I'm a big believer and for a long time I

291
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:57,320
used to underestimate the power of

292
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,670
encouragement and active listening and

293
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:02,250
frankly just being there for someone you

294
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:03,480
know several months ago I was helping

295
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:06,900
someone apply to some jobs and she was

296
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:08,190
very apprehensive because she thought

297
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:10,140
her background in music would be looked

298
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:12,990
down upon and I was talking to her and

299
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:14,970
we brainstorm ways and how to remedy

300
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:15,830
that

301
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:17,150
they threw a cover letter and all of

302
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:18,950
that and but more stuff was reminding

303
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:20,660
her that her skill spoke for themselves

304
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:22,850
and that she was in fact a really really

305
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:26,300
good developer but more so what I was

306
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:27,520
really doing was just listening

307
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,510
providing encouragement and helping

308
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:31,640
build their confidence today

309
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:33,560
I mean she's happily employed at this

310
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,210
company's Innovation Lab doing great

311
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:39,650
things or you can share connections and

312
00:11:39,650 --> 00:11:42,140
questions you know there was another

313
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:43,370
time where I was reached out about

314
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:45,050
advice between deciding two job offers

315
00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:47,540
do I take this one or did I take this

316
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:51,590
one and he's like okay you know these

317
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:53,540
are the pros and cons for Company A but

318
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:55,220
at the same time Company B has these

319
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:56,600
kind of things I don't know I don't know

320
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,400
get it what do you think as I'm thinking

321
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,560
like wait actually I think I know

322
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:03,290
someone that company a so said okay give

323
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:05,450
me give me like ten minutes call the

324
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:07,250
friendly hey do you actually have

325
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:08,660
someone who's thinking about joining

326
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:11,630
that company used to work there can you

327
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:13,250
you know give your your feedback your

328
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:14,270
advice on what you thought about the

329
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:17,450
company and so connected them both and

330
00:12:17,450 --> 00:12:18,260
the rest is history

331
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:21,380
other times connections are just

332
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:22,790
resources themselves

333
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:23,960
there's been times where I've been

334
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:26,150
shared a certain book assert an article

335
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:28,130
a certain video that had quite the

336
00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:29,510
impact I'm I like that frankly when I

337
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:31,640
google something there's so many like

338
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:33,110
how do I even pick and choose but when

339
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:34,550
someone can say actually ignore these

340
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:37,550
start with this one first that's big big

341
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:42,230
big big help now going back to when you

342
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:45,290
can you know we have families we have

343
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:48,710
friends responsibilities we have so many

344
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:51,050
other hobbies and interests as well how

345
00:12:51,050 --> 00:12:53,920
do you actually fit mentorship into this

346
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,660
and that's the thing mentorship doesn't

347
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:59,060
have to be time-consuming it's an

348
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:01,040
ongoing process where frankly you're

349
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,710
just aware of one you can help and then

350
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:08,750
you do it for example a while back I

351
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:10,220
have a lot of interest I like business I

352
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:11,690
like psychology I like tech I like

353
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:15,290
people and I emailed in alumnus for

354
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:17,630
advice career advice and now he's a busy

355
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:20,030
guy he's a co-founder of this a startup

356
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:22,400
out in Boston and I'm like I don't know

357
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,990
if he's ever gonna reply but let me try

358
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:28,220
and he did and this email had follow-up

359
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:29,120
questions his

360
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,700
some shins insights things to consider

361
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:35,240
it was this long and the thing is we

362
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:38,420
never had a phone call never met in

363
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:41,830
person but that email had an impact and

364
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:45,380
it's because time isn't equal you know I

365
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:48,100
estimate that it took him about one hour

366
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:52,220
to write that email but on my end that

367
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:55,760
email easily easily save me about a few

368
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:56,960
weeks worth the time in terms of things

369
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,970
to consider what to research so on and

370
00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:01,040
so forth and it's the same with

371
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:05,390
mentorship other times I think about you

372
00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:07,510
know sometimes I have a busy week

373
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:10,970
sometimes I do not and so the weeks

374
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:12,710
where I have less time I leverage more

375
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:14,060
asynchronous forms of you can

376
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:18,260
communication email slack message boards

377
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:20,930
all of those other times when I have

378
00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:23,150
more time then I go into Ashley yeah

379
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:25,010
please let's grab a phone call it's meet

380
00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:26,589
in person or let's have a video chat

381
00:14:26,589 --> 00:14:31,550
just staying flexible and adaptable but

382
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:33,050
really what I want to emphasize is

383
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:35,120
mentorship in whatever way you can

384
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,640
that's best for you that you feel most

385
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:40,370
comfortable with you know I am not

386
00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:42,920
advocating nor saying that you should go

387
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:46,240
out and go find the mentee and say okay

388
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,890
for the next eight weeks every Wednesday

389
00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:50,360
at 6 p.m. we're gonna meet and we're

390
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,350
gonna talk you're going to talk about

391
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:52,730
life and your career goals I'm not

392
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:54,830
saying to do that you can if you want to

393
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:57,980
but you don't have to it's more about

394
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:01,580
taking it one conversation at a time you

395
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:03,580
know maybe you like to write blog posts

396
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:06,529
maybe you like to stream maybe videos

397
00:15:06,529 --> 00:15:08,720
maybe you like to speak at events those

398
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:12,200
are all good and the thing is it doesn't

399
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,940
really have to be about your job either

400
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:16,190
you know I have a friend who just E is

401
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:18,260
an avid guitarist any anyone who wants

402
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:19,490
to learn guitar he's like please send

403
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:20,690
them my way I just want to you know

404
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:22,600
teach amount of strum and all of that

405
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:25,040
he's a great he's a great engineer but

406
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,000
he doesn't like talking about that he

407
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,200
likes talk about the guitar and music

408
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:33,320
and the thing is really you open

409
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:35,270
yourself up for future conversations you

410
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:37,520
answer just one one single question you

411
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:40,520
leave the door open so that they can

412
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:42,780
follow up or maybe they don't and

413
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:45,900
right and regarding actual mentorship

414
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:48,180
you can happen anywhere anywhere and

415
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:49,950
everywhere it could be in your

416
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:52,680
organization it can be in your local

417
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:55,680
communities it can be even online you

418
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,420
know you remember one of my favorite

419
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:58,980
things I was going through Cora and

420
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:01,830
stackoverflow and someone asked if I

421
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:03,930
don't understand bubble sore if I don't

422
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:06,090
understand some sort of sorting or

423
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:08,670
common algorithm am i cut out to be an

424
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:10,830
engineer and just searing the

425
00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:13,050
overwhelming support of people saying no

426
00:16:13,050 --> 00:16:15,660
no no please no that's you can don't

427
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:17,700
don't no don't stop keep at it

428
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:20,160
just work it it'll come but then I think

429
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,900
about what about the flip side what if

430
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:23,580
people said oh yes please you got to

431
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:24,930
stop you just get out of the industry

432
00:16:24,930 --> 00:16:27,480
that would have been heartbreaking but

433
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:29,670
seeing that support online was both uh

434
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:31,610
it was it was fantastic

435
00:16:31,610 --> 00:16:34,650
at the same time I there is there's a

436
00:16:34,650 --> 00:16:36,840
person in my company now whenever

437
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:39,030
there's a new joiner he actively goes

438
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:41,040
out of his way to say hey let's grab a

439
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,590
coffee let me take you out to lunch let

440
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:45,420
me actually meet let me connect you with

441
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:47,670
someone else so it can just happen

442
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:50,940
anywhere and everywhere so the thing is

443
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:53,930
where do you actually find mentees

444
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:58,470
there's two ways I go to them and so one

445
00:16:58,470 --> 00:17:00,440
of the best ten dollars I've ever spent

446
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:02,610
around these business cards they were

447
00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:04,380
simple nothing flashy essentially they

448
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:06,390
just had my name and my email address

449
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:09,750
and so then I go to meetups or events

450
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:11,700
you know I talk and then afterwards like

451
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:13,500
hey by the way here's my card please

452
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:18,600
feel free to reach out so us it was

453
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:20,730
inspired because you know a friend was

454
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:22,410
telling me sometimes it's not that we

455
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:25,890
don't want to reach out it's not that we

456
00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:27,210
don't want to put in the work it's

457
00:17:27,210 --> 00:17:29,730
sometimes we're shy or were embarrassed

458
00:17:29,730 --> 00:17:31,530
or were uncomfortable or we don't know

459
00:17:31,530 --> 00:17:34,110
who to reach out to and so I mobility

460
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:35,700
I'm a believer that we can actually take

461
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:37,740
that first step and take that initiative

462
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:41,040
so whether it's contacting your own alma

463
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,510
mater Zoar schools whether it's your

464
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:44,220
middle schools high schools colleges

465
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:46,650
coding boot camps they would love to

466
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:48,090
have people come in and talk to the

467
00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:49,590
students like this is me this is where I

468
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:51,690
came from these are my stories these are

469
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:52,830
my experiences these are the really

470
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:54,240
really cool things that I get to build

471
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,220
now at

472
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:57,809
same time there's organizations like

473
00:17:57,809 --> 00:18:00,600
tech job store code 2040 girls who code

474
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:01,919
all just different kinds of

475
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:03,750
organizations who are desperately

476
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:06,809
desperately in need of people with your

477
00:18:06,809 --> 00:18:08,880
talent with your experiences who could

478
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,470
just share stories and they don't have

479
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:12,330
to be these formal commitments it could

480
00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:14,159
just be one time and that's more than

481
00:18:14,159 --> 00:18:18,440
enough for people to see and believe or

482
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:21,120
instead you can take this approach of

483
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,730
like a lighthouse and you're out there

484
00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:25,289
and you're kind of just like hey I'm

485
00:18:25,289 --> 00:18:27,150
over here please if you want to reach

486
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:30,510
out email me and so whether so for

487
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:34,080
example I have it on my my LinkedIn

488
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:37,440
summary my Twitter bio it's just a

489
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,760
little note that says and on my personal

490
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:41,250
site hey if there's anything I can do to

491
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:44,940
help you please reach out so at the same

492
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:46,080
time I know some of you are fairly

493
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,789
fairly fairly famous in the whole

494
00:18:47,789 --> 00:18:50,730
Twitter community so for those with

495
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:51,809
large followings there are ways to

496
00:18:51,809 --> 00:18:54,090
mitigate that with email aliases and

497
00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:56,880
filters as well but more so again I was

498
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,190
told that sometimes people don't know

499
00:18:59,190 --> 00:19:01,289
who to reach out to and again they don't

500
00:19:01,289 --> 00:19:04,080
want to come off as rude or intrusive or

501
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,480
as a little too forward just helping

502
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,340
them know like hey I am actually a

503
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:10,380
fellow Ally I'm a fellow supporter

504
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:14,370
please reach out to me more so what this

505
00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:16,830
really is it's it's a it's a communal

506
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:20,909
effort it's it's about how can we as a

507
00:19:20,909 --> 00:19:23,760
community redefine and rethink what

508
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,409
mentorship is again I think the former

509
00:19:25,409 --> 00:19:27,059
programs are really great but it's more

510
00:19:27,059 --> 00:19:28,830
about how can we make it more organic

511
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:31,740
and more fluid and so after this talk

512
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:33,720
I'll be sharing this repo in this online

513
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,820
document that has tools it has

514
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:36,659
techniques

515
00:19:36,659 --> 00:19:38,850
it has strategies and these really

516
00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:41,549
contain actionable steps and all of that

517
00:19:41,549 --> 00:19:43,380
so that you can get started and adding

518
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:44,820
more of a framework and more like step

519
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:47,549
by step guide but really this this is

520
00:19:47,549 --> 00:19:50,159
that's just my thinking and that's a few

521
00:19:50,159 --> 00:19:51,960
others thinking this really should be a

522
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:54,450
mind share a collective of every one of

523
00:19:54,450 --> 00:19:58,500
what the community embodies so please

524
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,450
feel free to make a pull request or send

525
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:02,880
me a message and I'll add it myself it's

526
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,559
really just talking about hey actually

527
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:06,330
these are things to consider these are

528
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:09,140
some edge cases these are some outliers

529
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:10,580
this should this could be a one-stop

530
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:12,260
shop for those who think wow I really

531
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:13,820
can't mentor it but I really want to

532
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:16,040
deep down but but then I'm like no it's

533
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,510
about minimizing that barrier to entry

534
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:19,970
so people can and go out and a ripple

535
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:20,980
effect

536
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:24,110
granted I do acknowledge that mentorship

537
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:25,790
is a two-way street it's not just the

538
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:27,800
whole onus and responsibility isn't just

539
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:30,560
on us there is responsibility on the

540
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,960
mentee themselves granted that's

541
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:35,060
probably a whole blog post in the talk

542
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:36,500
for another day but for right now this

543
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,810
is more about the mentorship part and

544
00:20:38,810 --> 00:20:40,910
what I asked right now as a call to

545
00:20:40,910 --> 00:20:43,010
action of sorts to take this brief

546
00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:45,320
minute whether it's your phone whether

547
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:46,880
