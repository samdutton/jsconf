[Music]

2
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:18,480
I'm here my name is Wilson - originally

3
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,130
from Brazil live in two years Australia

4
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:23,070
and today I will talk some point some

5
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:25,949
tips and tricks things that can help you

6
00:00:25,949 --> 00:00:29,330
to evolve your application like from

7
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:31,800
mono leaf application to a micro surfs

8
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:35,780
application but first of all let's talk

9
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:39,870
few things like I'm not that good with

10
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:43,370
jokes but trust me I'll do my best and

11
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:46,079
one thing that really interesting about

12
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:51,180
myself like I really like products so I

13
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:54,449
just want to call you guys to take a

14
00:00:54,449 --> 00:01:00,180
small picture here and hey do something

15
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:09,150
crazy yeah I'm recording guys but yeah I

16
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:12,930
really love that things so you guys know

17
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:14,189
about me and know a little bit about

18
00:01:14,189 --> 00:01:18,360
yourselves but let's talk about our

19
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:21,540
story once upon a time in the web

20
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:24,119
because every good story starts with

21
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:30,450
this phrase we had a few people who just

22
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:33,780
come together as a startup and they

23
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:36,329
create an application called my amaze

24
00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:39,869
app larmes app came your idea of MVP

25
00:01:39,869 --> 00:01:43,049
just to validate few few points about

26
00:01:43,049 --> 00:01:46,380
the business and it works pretty well

27
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:51,450
but in a business way but in besides the

28
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:52,079
code

29
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:56,240
the initial version had some issues

30
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,979
first of all it was a mono life

31
00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:01,170
application so after six months after

32
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:03,570
one year they realized that was an

33
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:05,909
application was hard to evolve hard to

34
00:02:05,909 --> 00:02:08,879
maintain like add the feature or remove

35
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:10,830
a feature or evolve a feature was

36
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:13,140
something really painful for the team

37
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:16,980
and why because it was highly called

38
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:21,000
corporate code like it was presentation

39
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,100
layers and data based layers and

40
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:25,410
back-end layers everything was you guys

41
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:27,180
in the same place like we're talking

42
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:29,160
about an application that starts 10

43
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:32,970
years ago so that was something that in

44
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:35,430
that moment was not the main focus but

45
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:38,100
it started to be and because of mix of

46
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:42,330
layers they had some issues one of the

47
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:45,150
issues was related to the page load like

48
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:48,000
as you guys can see you have three HTTP

49
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,019
requests each one for each component but

50
00:02:52,019 --> 00:02:54,720
you have some issues around like the

51
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,690
first ATP ATP call it was successfully

52
00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:02,040
the second was just failed and the third

53
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:06,090
one it is still painting and the

54
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:07,920
application was not resilient for those

55
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:14,280
things so that was another point let's

56
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:17,310
talk about mobile website ten years ago

57
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:19,890
this was something that was interesting

58
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:23,220
for some companies and after that they

59
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:25,320
realized okay now we have two code bases

60
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:28,730
we have to duplicate a logic which is

61
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:33,190
insane

62
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,510
another point pretty much this company

63
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:42,450
had to care a lot about SEO and Google's

64
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:44,910
not benevolent if you're not following

65
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:47,430
the rules not only Google every surgeon

66
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:49,019
team if you're not following some

67
00:03:49,019 --> 00:03:51,930
cereals SEO rules you just being

68
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:55,340
punished all right this is one of

69
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:59,220
auditions and as you guys can see we

70
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:02,010
have really really bad numbers like ten

71
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:05,070
performers and this was just example

72
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:09,359
using a tool called lighthouse and it's

73
00:04:09,359 --> 00:04:13,310
enough so okay we know those points and

74
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:15,810
we know the code wedgie time when you

75
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:17,729
look is something like that you have

76
00:04:17,729 --> 00:04:19,979
that feeling it really have that feeling

77
00:04:19,979 --> 00:04:23,640
geez it's hard to maintain so what

78
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,289
happens every time there had that

79
00:04:25,289 --> 00:04:26,850
feeling you try to avoid

80
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:29,760
that behavior okay if I just wanted to

81
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,800
add something of just add more code add

82
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:34,340
more code it's a natural behavior

83
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:36,890
it's not a good way to play this game

84
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:45,510
not at all so okay we came into this

85
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:50,160
idea why not now that we have the

86
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,700
business values totally validated let's

87
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:56,610
start improving because improvements are

88
00:04:56,610 --> 00:04:59,640
cycle right so let's start with MVP our

89
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:04,650
main P now version 2 with few ideas in

90
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:09,020
your mind one of them is first do it

91
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:13,140
second gen do it right and then do it

92
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:15,660
better it's one of the phrase who came

93
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:18,570
long time ago of Russia agile manifest

94
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:20,400
it just another interpretation of the

95
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:24,420
same idea who is released early release

96
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:27,900
often do do it better do it always

97
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:32,220
better yeah let's talk about make it

98
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:34,740
better so we have few things that we

99
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:36,000
need to keep in mind right

100
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,090
our current application had to care

101
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:42,990
about SEO should be easy to maintain now

102
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:46,020
the company grow and it it's working

103
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:49,070
distributed across three three three

104
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:52,860
countries like Australia Brazil and

105
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:55,740
India for example we have really really

106
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:59,490
huge gaps on the stem zones should be

107
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:01,820
easy to maintain should be reusable

108
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:05,360
however every time they look those codes

109
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,940
you you can say ok I won't have this

110
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:12,240
feeling but in the end that's the first

111
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:15,480
idea who came in your mind just let it

112
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:18,750
be right because you can create a brand

113
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:21,840
new application from scratch it should

114
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,660
be great know you can use all the real

115
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:26,580
green technologies but in the other hand

116
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:30,270
you need to have empathy not only with

117
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:32,580
the code but with the whole history

118
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:34,710
dairy have all validations that that

119
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:37,710
code which not simple to read but

120
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:40,140
already had all the experience

121
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:44,100
so this is not a possibility a big bang

122
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:47,240
is not a possibility and what it can do

123
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:51,750
mark restraints few things we just

124
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:55,560
realized that you shouldn't have in any

125
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:58,890
important this mobile website all the

126
00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:01,350
things should be the same codebase you

127
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:04,050
need to duplicate logic now doesn't make

128
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:04,740
any sense

129
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:08,640
like before it doesn't make two but it

130
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:11,190
was something that that company couldn't

131
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:15,630
see and locus architectures some ideas

132
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:17,880
some approaches should be something

133
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:21,630
component based like because right now

134
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:23,970
if we talk about front-end if we talk

135
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:26,280
about web applications it's pretty much

136
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,990
one of the good things that came to

137
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:31,980
right should be worth web friendly now

138
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:34,050
we have different browsers we have html5

139
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:36,660
API we have all the things I can use to

140
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:39,680
improve the usability they use a journey

141
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:44,490
from starting application until do what

142
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:48,270
they want to do and last but not least

143
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:54,960
it should migrate page by page but what

144
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,420
that means how can you just migrate one

145
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:59,730
page in the home on a leaf let's talk

146
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:06,000
about the monolith few years ago we just

147
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,770
heard about microservice it's a cool

148
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:13,080
architecture pattern so you can use it's

149
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:16,950
pretty pretty pretty heavily used and we

150
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:19,320
start with one question can I use micro

151
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:23,880
services as pwe application using react

152
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:28,680
or angular or vgs or any other framework

153
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,780
library we create frameworks and

154
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:33,500
libraries javascript every single minute

155
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:37,160
and yes we can

156
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:40,890
why firstly first of all let's talk

157
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:43,920
about architecture some i really a

158
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:46,710
really top layer when we talk about

159
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:48,330
micro services and those things micro

160
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:50,850
frameworks and micro bundles we are talk

161
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:54,490
about a micro way

162
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:57,950
the first goal is how is it is to

163
00:08:57,950 --> 00:09:02,030
upgrade your application they start with

164
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:04,520
these ideas and the polenta together in

165
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,530
the car and now micro services like if

166
00:09:06,530 --> 00:09:08,360
you have a bundle in you don't need to

167
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,620
care about a lot of things you have a

168
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:12,860
micro bundle and if you have a framework

169
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:14,270
they need to care about a specific

170
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:16,490
boundary you can you can use a micro

171
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:18,590
framework and so on and so forth

172
00:09:18,590 --> 00:09:21,470
so long time ago angularjs just called

173
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:31,490
this as micro whatever and VW and micro

174
00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:37,190
fronting okay so it's a micro service so

175
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:43,130
a front-end quick quiz what is a micro

176
00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:43,640
fronting

177
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:46,430
is that a new tooling is that a new

178
00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:50,600
framework like Zen a new Chrome

179
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:56,960
extension it's a technique so every time

180
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:59,900
someone talk about you like to use these

181
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:03,080
you can you should use this primer or to

182
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,780
use that you need to use this tooling

183
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:08,090
it's not totally related we talk about

184
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:10,160
approaches we'll talk about abductor

185
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:16,010
things and about architectural patterns

186
00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:18,770
who here have you heard about strangle

187
00:10:18,770 --> 00:10:24,590
pattern okay few people the interest

188
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:26,440
point of strangle partner is one of the

189
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:29,240
foundations of Microsoft's but people

190
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,610
usually don't talk too much about it but

191
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:33,530
what is a strangle partner at the end of

192
00:10:33,530 --> 00:10:36,260
the day and how can these will be useful

193
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:38,990
for application let's give a small

194
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:42,680
example let's say that we have a

195
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:44,570
monolith application which this is

196
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:48,320
tagged to and you have a brand new stack

197
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,810
with only one page that we want to

198
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:55,670
migrate you need our vex arrest proxy so

199
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:58,340
you say when you let's think about the

200
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:02,900
rest proxy like when you go to a shop

201
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:07,230
market and they ask you hey Jonah pay by

202
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:10,320
by card you have different cues depend

203
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:13,050
of your gangster this guy that we call

204
00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:15,870
reverse proxy just say okay you're going

205
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:18,870
to the new page so go to that side oh no

206
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:20,670
it's not that page it's not the page

207
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:21,270
emigrate

208
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:23,730
go to the old one and you can't start to

209
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:26,730
say okay let me just check 10% of the

210
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:28,620
new page it works fine

211
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:30,870
no eros it's working so far so good

212
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:32,880
twenty percent thirty percent and

213
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,620
carefully date for the thanks you can

214
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:37,140
use some matrix so the game starts will

215
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:46,230
be cool and hot so called problems now

216
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:47,490
we will talk about the texture thing

217
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:51,360
okay we understand how the broad and

218
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,250
concept among about micro front-end but

219
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:55,680
about code because we are talking about

220
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,360
the mono live application right so we

221
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:01,110
need to clean the kitchen before start

222
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:02,480
cook

223
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:06,050
first of all online design teams and

224
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:09,480
your developer teams to they should work

225
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,970
together and they have a lot of approach

226
00:12:11,970 --> 00:12:14,940
talk about front-end right now one of

227
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:17,970
old code but really really useful is

228
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:22,830
atomic design by Brad Frost concept is

229
00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:25,050
quite it's quite interesting like you

230
00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:28,230
have atoms molecules start to be

231
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:31,620
granular until you become with a page

232
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:35,790
and but it was a long time ago that was

233
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:37,320
created now you have a lot of other

234
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:40,560
options so keep open like like we have

235
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,690
here at the bottom we are talking about

236
00:12:42,690 --> 00:12:45,210
material design which pretty much same

237
00:12:45,210 --> 00:12:48,210
idea outline everything all the teams

238
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:50,760
should be thinking together we have the

239
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:56,280
same goal and things interesting about

240
00:12:56,280 --> 00:13:00,000
those two approaches at the end they

241
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,540
have the same goal this same idea so the

242
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:06,780
page one component is a composition of

243
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:11,700
components page two you can use or not

244
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:14,520
one of those components and it starts to

245
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:18,280
be things they start to be plug and play

246
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:22,750
and everything's a component like if you

247
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:25,620
go back here with talk about pages and

248
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:28,180
other protectress parts pretty much

249
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:30,610
component page one is a component and

250
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:35,200
all the UI components are creating our

251
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:40,150
kupuna still so Y components it's all

252
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:42,370
scope so you really have well-defined

253
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:46,660
boundaries about that idea okay I'm

254
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:49,540
doing a search box I don't need to know

255
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:51,700
about the whole world I just need to

256
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:55,030
know how to do a search and sometimes

257
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:56,080
that doesn't I just

258
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,670
even need to know like if you have a

259
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,350
really component totally the corporate

260
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:01,480
you don't even know any to know that we

261
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:03,880
have to cop something in some way and

262
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:07,840
should work and everything component is

263
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:10,480
kind of plug and play which is great

264
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:13,000
that was the first idea of the component

265
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:22,230
and that was the idea right beautiful

266
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:24,700
other things we talked about teams

267
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:27,070
distributed teams so when you do a small

268
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:30,280
component it doesn't matter if a small

269
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:32,170
component which has been used in only

270
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:35,880
one page or 30 pages please think about

271
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:39,640
empathy all the teens shouldn't prove

272
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:42,070
that that code should evolve that code

273
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:45,520
it is one idea create demo page in this

274
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:48,940
case it's being used storybook which is

275
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:51,280
a pretty cool library then you can you

276
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:54,700
can integrate if all the best frameworks

277
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:57,130
that we have right now and in the other

278
00:14:57,130 --> 00:14:58,660
side you have Auto validation so you can

279
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:00,820
read easily prologue in play you can

280
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:03,400
create scenarios create some fixtures

281
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,830
okay you have this component and when

282
00:15:05,830 --> 00:15:08,589
this component app receives a specific

283
00:15:08,589 --> 00:15:11,020
property or when this property changed

284
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:13,390
what should happen you have all the

285
00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:16,570
things together so easy it's easy to

286
00:15:16,570 --> 00:15:18,460
read it me someone who don't know how to

287
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:21,130
code know what that cop that component

288
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:28,019
thus and on think that now is

289
00:15:28,029 --> 00:15:30,519
really really up a string and it's

290
00:15:30,519 --> 00:15:31,930
interesting that we have this discussion

291
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:33,939
right now because years ago we didn't

292
00:15:33,939 --> 00:15:37,600
have it's about zero config part forms I

293
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,629
would say you can have bundles with the

294
00:15:40,629 --> 00:15:42,939
your config you can have a setup with 0

295
00:15:42,939 --> 00:15:46,930
config and so on but a long time ago we

296
00:15:46,930 --> 00:15:48,610
didn't have this discussion so we didn't

297
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:50,319
have a lot of packages open source

298
00:15:50,319 --> 00:15:53,889
packages so in some scenarios you just

299
00:15:53,889 --> 00:15:56,709
can't use one of those zero configs

300
00:15:56,709 --> 00:15:58,420
because of a lot of reasons internal

301
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:01,110
reasons and some business reasons or

302
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:05,829
even some rules based on the country in

303
00:16:05,829 --> 00:16:08,410
those and others think and boilerplates

304
00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:11,740
as a solution I will explain a little

305
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:14,939
bit more about it like why zero config

306
00:16:14,939 --> 00:16:19,449
first of all opinions everyone here has

307
00:16:19,449 --> 00:16:22,439
a really and great opinion about all

308
00:16:22,439 --> 00:16:27,750
those steps bundle tests publish linked

309
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:30,939
we have a lot of tool is for linked

310
00:16:30,939 --> 00:16:36,040
right now reporter and so on and if you

311
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:38,290
look at github right now it's pretty

312
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:40,509
impressive because when we start the

313
00:16:40,509 --> 00:16:42,490
discussions you can find a lot of other

314
00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:44,470
packages talking about zero

315
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:47,459
configuration such as great react app or

316
00:16:47,459 --> 00:16:53,920
angular CLI ember CLI and this is great

317
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:57,269
for us because there's a lot of opinions

318
00:16:57,269 --> 00:17:05,049
that we can integrate or extend however

319
00:17:05,049 --> 00:17:07,510
as I said before in some scenarios you

320
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:11,110
cannot just use one of this okay let's

321
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:14,530
think about a good way to integrate you

322
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:16,299
have a tooling for example can be you

323
00:17:16,299 --> 00:17:19,120
just use a yeoman generator just for a

324
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:21,610
small piece as we said before we are

325
00:17:21,610 --> 00:17:23,589
working with components so we can create

326
00:17:23,589 --> 00:17:25,720
a small piece and can create as a

327
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:30,460
standard in your team's and photos for

328
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:32,740
those if you have to improve or like

329
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:35,770
your boilerplate just upgraded and have

330
00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:37,840
to upgrade the components who are using

331
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:38,470
this boilerplate

332
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:40,840
you can use this package called update

333
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:41,980
yeoman generator

334
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:46,030
it's pretty fun it just is solid in that

335
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:48,670
case is globally go to your component

336
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:51,970
folder and around the common and when

337
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:56,310
you read this comment it will be updated

338
00:17:56,310 --> 00:18:00,610
magic that's what we like don't repeat

339
00:18:00,610 --> 00:18:05,890
yourself and other thing that you can

340
00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:08,200
have some benefits using this

341
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:11,710
architecture is you have a lot of firing

342
00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:13,770
validations let's think about it like

343
00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:16,720
first of all when you doing a bundle

344
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,990
when you do a deployment you had to burn

345
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:22,510
create a build bundle file for your

346
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:25,270
vendors or your page one you're paid to

347
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:27,220
sometimes we just put up there together

348
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:30,250
we talk about application long years ago

349
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:33,040
and now you can have different

350
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:35,580
approaches like now have different pages

351
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:39,340
you can create specific files for the

352
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:43,180
page one page two page three and when

353
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:44,710
you have in validations instead of

354
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:47,980
having validations for the specific

355
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:49,750
vendor you can have for the specific

356
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:52,170
file when we talk about validations USA

357
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:55,030
is a different files and you fire your

358
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:59,190
browser need to download anymore again

359
00:18:59,190 --> 00:19:03,970
if you don't know more about it Sam did

360
00:19:03,970 --> 00:19:07,750
a really really good talk and at chrome

361
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:09,820
dev summit last year about the future

362
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:13,030
the future of loading or web which

363
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:15,130
pretty interesting talk about this and

364
00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:18,220
other points and how the web platform is

365
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:24,700
evolving to help all of us so we have a

366
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:27,460
checklist from China Kentucky right now

367
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:30,640
is great so we have volved the

368
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33,940
application and we are happy with this

369
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:38,560
and its component based as we saw a lot

370
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:41,380
of applications the market is using a

371
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:43,360
component based application its web

372
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:47,560
friendly so every single developer who

373
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:49,750
is using that has the whole knowledge

374
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:52,600
and can use all the power of the web

375
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,450
platform

376
00:19:54,450 --> 00:19:58,770
it's mind-blowing like we'll talk about

377
00:19:58,770 --> 00:20:01,950
one thing that we had a real really

378
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:03,450
application that we had ten years ago

379
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:06,120
and now we let's talk a brand new

380
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:09,360
architecture it was validated we had all

381
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:14,010
the steps it's a production and metrics

382
00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:18,840
but metrics pretty much everywhere after

383
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:22,620
you just deployed the first page you

384
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:24,660
think okay the first page done let's

385
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:27,360
keep the flow let's create some metrics

386
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:30,150
to validate and those much kusa can be a

387
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:32,790
mix of combinations can be a usual

388
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:36,060
conversion can be errors errors that you

389
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:38,600
have in that page you can create your

390
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:42,350
what makes sense for your application

391
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:46,260
there is one just one example screenshot

392
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:48,900
of a platform called New Relic so you

393
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:50,970
can just go there and do some searched

394
00:20:50,970 --> 00:20:57,600
and create your your visualization for

395
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:01,020
that data and start to see hey this just

396
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:03,720
increased a little bit probably we're

397
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:06,000
having memory leak we can work on that

398
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,940
or okay it was it they use the

399
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:10,530
conversion just increased that's really

400
00:21:10,530 --> 00:21:12,600
good let's start work at that new relic

401
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,640
is just example you can use a lot of

402
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,330
them for example Google tag manager and

403
00:21:17,330 --> 00:21:23,730
adopted manager and all of them all

404
00:21:23,730 --> 00:21:28,790
those steps are related to one thing

405
00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:32,580
release early release often when you

406
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:35,400
have only one page you don't need to do

407
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,430
a deployment for the whole application

408
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:41,070
what that means things can have full

409
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:44,670
ownership of that thing at that code

410
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:48,180
that that behavior usually they should

411
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:49,950
have since since the beginning but

412
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:51,660
sometimes I thought something happened

413
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:53,850
in the mirror of the process and they

414
00:21:53,850 --> 00:21:58,940
just lost this truck and release early

415
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:01,440
you have something you can easily

416
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:05,070
validate ship the production or ship and

417
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:07,320
other environments before do some

418
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:08,300
validations business

419
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:10,910
validation or even front-end validations

420
00:22:10,910 --> 00:22:12,380
performance validations and so on

421
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:16,700
and now we have our amazing happen the

422
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:20,420
Division two is mobile-friendly so it's

423
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:23,330
totally web platform friendly and this

424
00:22:23,330 --> 00:22:30,020
so nice and about SEO google now loves

425
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:34,850
this application if you see their last

426
00:22:34,850 --> 00:22:36,200
edition it was great

427
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:40,990
91 of 100 pretty cool

428
00:22:40,990 --> 00:22:44,120
everyone is happy the users happy the

429
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:46,010
developer team is happy the business

430
00:22:46,010 --> 00:22:57,080
team is happy and how should be now

431
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:59,530
another point next steps right

432
00:22:59,530 --> 00:23:04,790
we always think and ok we did that it's

433
00:23:04,790 --> 00:23:07,970
a cycle make it make it work make it

434
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:10,250
better and we need to think about it

435
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:12,890
like now we have a micro service but

436
00:23:12,890 --> 00:23:17,120
things like zero downtime what zero

437
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:20,660
downtime is what happens if your server

438
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:23,720
just goes down what's happened for the

439
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:30,050
user just see your page or the person

440
00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:33,110
just don't see anything how can you work

441
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:35,480
with that so you can use some tools for

442
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,840
this one example is you create a service

443
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:41,810
function and store your HTML in some

444
00:23:41,810 --> 00:23:44,060
place just example or you create our

445
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:47,300
engine X and store some cash so at least

446
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:50,390
for the user when it goes it access that

447
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:53,450
page it can see something and you can

448
00:23:53,450 --> 00:23:56,120
make sure that at least specific or

449
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:59,090
features are available so in case like

450
00:23:59,090 --> 00:24:02,000
your application if your page just goes

451
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,420
down for 10 minutes for the user

452
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:08,720
it's transparent the person didn't

453
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:13,310
notice that

454
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:19,390
and more about code if you wanna see a

455
00:24:19,390 --> 00:24:23,290
real case just a proof of concept so you

456
00:24:23,290 --> 00:24:25,690
can have first your monolith application

457
00:24:25,690 --> 00:24:29,470
and after you can check page by page my

458
00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:31,720
grade a if you wanna see those things

459
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:35,020
and play around this is a github repo

460
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:38,710
quick that I created so just download it

461
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:40,930
and start to play around it's required

462
00:24:40,930 --> 00:24:43,000
talker but it's really straightforward

463
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,880
you just need to install it and run a

464
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:52,360
comment easy how should be yeah that's

465
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:52,990
it

466
00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:55,720
I hope you guys enjoy as much as I enjoy

467
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:58,360
it and thanks so much
