1
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,110

so yet so my talk is sweating the small

2
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:24,750
stuff recreating subtle design details

3
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:28,230
using SAS and I was going to have a

4
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:31,710
longer title but it wouldn't fit so but

5
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:33,570
my name is Tim hatler I'm an open

6
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:36,269
standards developer at r/ga in New York

7
00:00:36,269 --> 00:00:39,000
City and so for the next 20 minutes I'm

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,590
going to be talking about this button

9
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:42,690
and the process that it took from going

10
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:44,910
from Photoshop comp to something that is

11
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:49,559
in production today so we were doing a

12
00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:52,170
redesign for a client last year we were

13
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:54,270
kind of embraced progressive enhancement

14
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:57,600
css3 and we're like we're not going to

15
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,140
cut up sprites anymore we're going to do

16
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:02,640
we're going to do this with CSS and so

17
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,649
this is what our designers created in

18
00:01:04,649 --> 00:01:06,690
Photoshop we have a normal state and an

19
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:09,720
active state and it looks like a pretty

20
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,100
straightforward conversion you know

21
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:13,380
there's rounded corners gradient

22
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:15,990
overlays text shadows drop shadows it

23
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:17,610
should be something easy to convert the

24
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:20,340
CSS so the designers just kind of gave

25
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:21,930
the developers the photoshop file and

26
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:23,880
they're like all right go to town and so

27
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:26,670
this is what our developers came back

28
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:30,360
with and this is not exactly what we're

29
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:32,819
looking for so that obviously the colors

30
00:01:32,819 --> 00:01:34,920
are all wrong the drop shadows are weird

31
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,630
and they're like I don't know we just

32
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:38,459
looked at the photoshop file and we just

33
00:01:38,459 --> 00:01:40,259
put everything in and so we started

34
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:42,030
talking with the designers and the

35
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:44,670
developers about like what the problem

36
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:46,979
was and so we realized in some cases the

37
00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:48,869
design what the designers use to

38
00:01:48,869 --> 00:01:50,429
describe something is different than

39
00:01:50,429 --> 00:01:52,770
what the developers need and in other

40
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:55,080
cases the designers have vocabulary that

41
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:59,940
developers just don't have it all so you

42
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:01,289
know we have a failure to communicate

43
00:02:01,289 --> 00:02:03,989
here designers and developers aren't

44
00:02:03,989 --> 00:02:06,360
speaking the same language what the

45
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,190
designers put in the Photoshop isn't

46
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:11,730
what developers need for CSS so how do

47
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:14,610
we solve this translation issue well the

48
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:17,040
traditional approach was to create you

49
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,020
know a style guide like this and this is

50
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:21,060
comically complex and large you're not

51
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:22,590
supposed to be able to read what it is

52
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:24,870
but this is actually what are our

53
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:27,030
designers had to produce for us because

54
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:29,550
they they stopped trusting us basically

55
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:32,610
to produce to take our Photoshop files

56
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:33,480
and make it

57
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,129
in the CSS without screwing it up so

58
00:02:35,129 --> 00:02:37,019
this is like we have so many different

59
00:02:37,019 --> 00:02:39,180
color buttons it's an e-commerce site

60
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:40,590
that we're working for so it was like

61
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:42,390
all these different buttons and we had

62
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:44,280
to define the top grading the bottom

63
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:47,099
gradient for all the states and also in

64
00:02:47,099 --> 00:02:48,480
there's a second level of complexity

65
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,860
because some of the buttons need white

66
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:51,120
texts and some of the buttons needed

67
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,970
dark text for contrast reasons so we

68
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:56,280
have this really kind of complex style

69
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,170
guide and there's a lot of failure

70
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:00,209
points with this traditional translation

71
00:03:00,209 --> 00:03:02,160
process I mean the designers have to

72
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:04,500
translate their own designs and then the

73
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:07,019
developers have to take that file and

74
00:03:07,019 --> 00:03:09,540
then translate it back into CSS and so

75
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:11,730
wouldn't it be great if we could cut out

76
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:13,349
the middleman and we could automate this

77
00:03:13,349 --> 00:03:15,870
translation well of course we can

78
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:17,569
otherwise my talk would be really sure

79
00:03:17,569 --> 00:03:20,760
and so we can automate this translation

80
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:23,640
with preprocessors they can act as the

81
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,500
Rosetta Stone between designers and

82
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:28,379
developers and we can use them to to

83
00:03:28,379 --> 00:03:30,239
translate our designs from Photoshop to

84
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:34,560
CSS flawlessly and so let's go back and

85
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,019
try to rebuild this button using sass

86
00:03:37,019 --> 00:03:39,329
and compass just to note about the

87
00:03:39,329 --> 00:03:42,090
technologies all my examples are in SAS

88
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:45,709
but if you use less or stylists you can

89
00:03:45,709 --> 00:03:48,540
you can definitely use the same ideas

90
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:49,980
and if you haven't use a preprocessor

91
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:51,840
yet your mind is about to explode

92
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,690
because they're amazing and so I'm also

93
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:56,190
using compass which is a framework

94
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:58,829
that's built on top of sass which adds a

95
00:03:58,829 --> 00:04:00,959
bunch of mix-ins and functions to solve

96
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:03,959
a lot of common problems that we that we

97
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:06,389
have as developers and compass kind of

98
00:04:06,389 --> 00:04:08,130
it feels like the jelly that goes with

99
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:11,760
sass peanut butter and so I don't use

100
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,109
them separately at all anymore it's

101
00:04:13,109 --> 00:04:16,440
always a Santa compass so first before

102
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,239
we get into like our translation we have

103
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:20,370
to like build up our base and we have to

104
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:22,500
sort of build all the stuff that isn't

105
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:23,849
going to change about our button

106
00:04:23,849 --> 00:04:25,950
regardless of the color in the context

107
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:27,720
and so we start off with like a

108
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:32,150
prototype placeholder button placeholder

109
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:34,110
selector and there's all the stuff

110
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:36,330
that's just going to undo what browsers

111
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:39,300
do by default two buttons and kind of

112
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:40,740
add all the stuff that isn't going to

113
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:42,390
change like our font and our border

114
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:45,210
radius stuff like that and so now when

115
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:47,340
we write our SAS we can

116
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:49,380
extend that button placeholder and so we

117
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:51,120
can work in sort of a object or any a

118
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,270
modular approach in our SAS and then

119
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:57,479
when it gets output to CSS it's done in

120
00:04:57,479 --> 00:04:59,160
a performant way so you can see here

121
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:01,830
instead of copying those 16 or so

122
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:04,290
properties we actually just increase the

123
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:06,600
selector chain and so this is one of the

124
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,770
the more powerful things with

125
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:09,600
preprocessors because you can the way

126
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,910
that you write the source code isn't

127
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:14,130
necessarily how it gets compiled so you

128
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:16,169
can write in a way that is comfortable

129
00:05:16,169 --> 00:05:17,820
for you and like make sense from

130
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:19,919
maintenance perspective but then when it

131
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:22,410
gets compiled it's it does what it needs

132
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:25,800
to do to have the smallest file size and

133
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,860
so now we have our base we and so what

134
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:31,650
we extend the button placeholder then we

135
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:33,030
just add the unique things about that

136
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:35,430
button so the only thing that's

137
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:36,870
different is is the background color

138
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:38,639
here and we actually we're already

139
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:41,729
running into a problem here because we

140
00:05:41,729 --> 00:05:43,740
as I said before we want our dark

141
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:45,210
buttons they have light texts and our

142
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:47,340
latex the light buttons have dark text

143
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:49,229
so let's see how we can use sass to

144
00:05:49,229 --> 00:05:51,330
automate that translation process so

145
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:55,020
that individual developers can't can't

146
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:57,900
screw it up basically so we can use a

147
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:59,940
built-in sass function to compare color

148
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:01,350
lightness there's a function called

149
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:03,630
lightness that returns a value between 0

150
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:06,539
and 100 just based on like the hsl value

151
00:06:06,539 --> 00:06:08,550
of that color and so here we just do

152
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:10,770
some simple logic and we're saying if

153
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:12,930
the color is greater than 50 so if the

154
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:14,370
background color is a light color we

155
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:16,740
want to return dark text and you know

156
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:19,919
vice versa so now our text color gets

157
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:22,320
set programmatically instead of setting

158
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:24,240
that color explicitly we call a function

159
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,340
and give it the background color and

160
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:27,630
then so you see on the right here when

161
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:30,570
our CSS gets compiled that decision gets

162
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:32,700
made for us and we don't have to worry

163
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:35,400
about like if an individual developer is

164
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,900
going to read our style guide properly

165
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:39,960
or not so sass allows us to abstract

166
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,610
design logic and this is a really

167
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:45,030
powerful tool because we can we can

168
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:47,190
abstract this stuff so these changes

169
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:49,740
these decisions happen behind the scenes

170
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:52,380
and so also later on if like you know

171
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:54,360
our marketing department or comes in or

172
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,740
like you know it really should be like

173
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:59,159
444 not 333 that a be test better we can

174
00:06:59,159 --> 00:07:00,599
change that in one place and then when

175
00:07:00,599 --> 00:07:00,930
we

176
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:02,639
recompile all these changes get made

177
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:06,600
automatically so now that we have our

178
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,820
base and some simple design logic let's

179
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:11,490
talk about how to translate to commonly

180
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:14,759
used layer styles from Photoshop and how

181
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:16,650
to convert them the CSS we're going to

182
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:18,630
start with drop shadow and how to turn

183
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:22,110
that into into a CSS box shadow and so

184
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:24,509
this is a CSS conference so I assume

185
00:07:24,509 --> 00:07:26,310
you've all written a box shadow before

186
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:27,690
but just to make sure we're on the same

187
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:31,020
page the CSS syntax we have x and y

188
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:33,479
offset the blur radius of spread radius

189
00:07:33,479 --> 00:07:35,910
and then a color and so this is and this

190
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:37,470
is what photoshop gives us which is

191
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:39,389
pretty similar but there's some

192
00:07:39,389 --> 00:07:41,210
important differences color and opacity

193
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:44,130
straightforward and spread in size are

194
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:46,229
pretty close to what we need but the big

195
00:07:46,229 --> 00:07:47,220
difference here and what we're going to

196
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:49,530
talk about is angle and distance and so

197
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:52,590
Photoshop hasn't it uses angle and

198
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:55,229
distance to set the the size of our

199
00:07:55,229 --> 00:07:57,210
shadow instead of just a straight up x

200
00:07:57,210 --> 00:08:00,300
and y offset and so you probably you

201
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:01,770
might not know right now but at some

202
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:03,840
point you're like 15 year old self knew

203
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:07,110
how to do this and so basically what we

204
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:09,510
have an angle in a distance which is so

205
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:11,460
we have a right triangle and so to

206
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:15,360
convert this from Photoshop to CSS we

207
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,430
just we need to find missing sides of a

208
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:20,550
triangle so good old sohcahtoa comes to

209
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:22,800
play here when I when I was like

210
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,780
building these slides I was going to

211
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:26,550
make a joke about like well the only

212
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:27,840
thing I remember from trigonometry is

213
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,639
sohcahtoa but then that actually ended

214
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:32,339
up being exactly what I needed and so I

215
00:08:32,339 --> 00:08:34,110
didn't even realize it until eyes like

216
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:37,979
wait okay yeah so anyway our our X

217
00:08:37,979 --> 00:08:40,229
offset is our is our Jason side of the

218
00:08:40,229 --> 00:08:42,120
triangle and our Y off says the opposite

219
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:46,589
side and so I I don't remember too much

220
00:08:46,589 --> 00:08:49,440
about trigonometry but but so they're

221
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,420
these basic formulas come into play

222
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:53,550
where it's just cosine of the angle

223
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:55,890
times the distance for the X offset the

224
00:08:55,890 --> 00:08:57,870
sine of the angle times the distance for

225
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:00,720
the y offset we can create a function

226
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,180
that takes all the values that were that

227
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:04,740
are in the Photoshop layer style and

228
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:07,649
does all these conversions automatically

229
00:09:07,649 --> 00:09:09,870
and then returns a list of values that

230
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:13,770
turns into a valid CSS syntax and so

231
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:14,700
this has actually been

232
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:17,970
as a compass extension that you can that

233
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:19,980
you can download on github I was I was

234
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:21,570
working on it myself but then I was

235
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:24,420
doing some research for this talk and

236
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:25,860
somebody had already pretty much done

237
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:28,140
the exact same thing i had so i'm i'm

238
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:30,540
linking to their stuff and because why

239
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:34,080
reinvent the wheel so so now let's add

240
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,670
the box shadow art button we can take

241
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:39,570
these values and put them right into our

242
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:42,270
SAS code using these functions and then

243
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:44,760
when it gets compiled into CSS we have a

244
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,860
valid box-shadow so now our button has a

245
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:49,290
nice subtle drop shadow in the normal

246
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:51,810
state and then an inset drop shadow in

247
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:54,930
the active state and so we so now we

248
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:57,360
have confidence that this drop shadow is

249
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,460
exactly what our designer intended

250
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:01,260
because we're using the same values that

251
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:04,110
they put in the photoshop and so we'll

252
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:05,580
go over text shadow because this is kind

253
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:09,240
of a freebie won the all the math is the

254
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,400
same for text shadow obviously but the

255
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,710
only difference between text shadow and

256
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:16,050
box shadows that and CSS of the spread

257
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:19,110
radius is not used by text shadow for

258
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:21,180
some actually I don't know why but it's

259
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:25,260
just not there so so this function takes

260
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:28,470
the photoshop takes the the list that we

261
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:30,990
return for this box shadow and it just

262
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:34,440
breaks up that list sasken can

263
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:37,290
manipulate list kind of like a raise so

264
00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:39,390
we're returning just the values that

265
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:41,370
we're omitting the the fourth value

266
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:43,530
which is the spread radius so that it

267
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:48,180
returns a valid text shadow value and so

268
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:49,500
again we're going to add this to our

269
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:50,940
button we're going to put in the values

270
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:53,340
directly from photoshop and then when we

271
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:55,560
get them what gets output is a valid

272
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,480
text shadow so now we have a text shadow

273
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,310
that alternates when we click on it it

274
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:01,800
just goes from top to bottom so giving

275
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:06,240
the illusion of depth so so we have our

276
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,300
shadows and now let's talk about how to

277
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:11,460
convert a gradient overlay to linear

278
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:13,290
gradient and so this is a little more

279
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:16,470
complex this is the the hard mode of the

280
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:18,960
talk but so again you guys have all

281
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,940
probably written a linear gradient

282
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:22,650
before but to make sure around the same

283
00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:24,960
page we start with an angle or keyword

284
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,250
which is the direction of the gradient

285
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:28,470
and then a series of color stops

286
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:31,590
and so Photoshop what they give us is

287
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:33,270
color and opacity which again is you

288
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:34,680
know straightforward stuff and then our

289
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:36,330
gradient which can be a simple to color

290
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:39,180
fade or it can be something crazy like

291
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:41,610
many many stops and we have the angle

292
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:43,410
which is the direction and then the

293
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:45,300
scale which is the size of the gradient

294
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:47,700
Photoshop allows you to create grading

295
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:49,530
overlays that are larger is smaller than

296
00:11:49,530 --> 00:11:53,160
the containing element and so angle you

297
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,960
think at first maybe is pretty

298
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,040
straightforward might be able to just

299
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:58,260
actually put in that value in the in the

300
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:01,110
CSS but surprise there are some browser

301
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:04,770
inconsistencies here the vendor prefixed

302
00:12:04,770 --> 00:12:07,380
version of linear gradient 0 degree

303
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:11,520
points to east but in the in the unfixed

304
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:14,010
version 0 degree equals north and in

305
00:12:14,010 --> 00:12:15,840
Photoshop actually the the vendor

306
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,700
prefixes is the same as the Photoshop

307
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:19,140
version so we have a lot of

308
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:21,090
inconsistencies of what 0 degrees

309
00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:23,550
actually where that actually points and

310
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:26,760
so how I've gone around this is I

311
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:29,010
created a function that converts the

312
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:32,220
angle to to a keyword when possible so

313
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:36,210
if if the angle is is like in a cardinal

314
00:12:36,210 --> 00:12:39,390
or ordinal distance like 0 45 90 degrees

315
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:42,300
it'll convert it to a keyword but

316
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:44,340
otherwise it assumes that you want the

317
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:46,950
unpriests the angle and so it subtracts

318
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:49,890
90 degrees from it so this I've never

319
00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:51,990
most of the time whenever I've worked

320
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:54,570
with a designer it's a you know they're

321
00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:56,430
working from like top or laugh or bottom

322
00:12:56,430 --> 00:12:58,680
so this has never been a problem in real

323
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,900
life before but there are there is some

324
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:03,390
limitations to what this conversion can

325
00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:06,900
do but then so let's move on the scale

326
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:09,090
scale is a little more complex to want

327
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:10,830
it to be we wanted to grow and shrink

328
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:12,810
and so at first you might be like well

329
00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:14,730
we'll just use the the background size

330
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:16,920
property but really we want to write

331
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,270
this as a function and functions only

332
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:20,490
return one value we can't return to

333
00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:23,280
different properties but the way around

334
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:26,040
this is to actually to the chain to

335
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:28,950
manipulate our color stops and like

336
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:31,290
where they are and so in CSS you're

337
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:33,150
actually allowed to have stops that are

338
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:34,740
less than zero percent are greater than

339
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:37,520
a hundred percent so if we won the scale

340
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:39,780
something to this gradient to one

341
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:42,060
hundred fifty percent say we still want

342
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:43,440
the middle to be in the middle of our

343
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,270
element so we'd actually start at

344
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:47,370
negative twenty-five percent and go to

345
00:13:47,370 --> 00:13:50,490
one hundred twenty-five percent and I I

346
00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:52,470
worked out this formula myself because I

347
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:54,660
couldn't I couldn't find it by googling

348
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:56,670
and this this actually ended up being

349
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:58,290
the hardest part of this talk is working

350
00:13:58,290 --> 00:13:59,850
at this formula so I'm really proud of

351
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:04,680
it but so now we so so now we need to

352
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,300
take all of our color stops and we need

353
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:08,670
to manipulate them based on our scale

354
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:11,580
and the way we do that with SAS is we're

355
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:13,140
going to put our gradient colors and our

356
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:14,340
gradient stops in the two different

357
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:16,470
lists and then we're going to use a for

358
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:18,540
loop just you know just like any other

359
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:19,860
programming language and we're going to

360
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:21,330
go through all those colors and we're

361
00:14:21,330 --> 00:14:23,460
going to manipulate that stop based on

362
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:25,950
the scale and so we're going to sort of

363
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:28,260
break those apart and then rebuild a new

364
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:31,590
list that that is and that it's what CSS

365
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:33,990
needs to create a linear gradient so

366
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:35,970
this works for simple gradients like a

367
00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:39,000
simple black to white fade or if your

368
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,740
designer is on LSD and wants to do

369
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:43,890
something super psychedelic you can put

370
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:45,840
in many color stops you can mess with

371
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:48,870
the the direction and the scale and no

372
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:50,820
matter how complex of a greeting you

373
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:52,970
have in Photoshop it will convert to CSS

374
00:14:52,970 --> 00:14:56,820
perfectly and so now so let's do the

375
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:59,010
same thing we've done with all the other

376
00:14:59,010 --> 00:15:00,060
stuff we're going to add the linear

377
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:01,290
grain to our button we're going to put

378
00:15:01,290 --> 00:15:03,240
in the values that are designer wanted

379
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:05,520
and then when it get converts to CSS

380
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:11,220
plot twist something went wrong and so

381
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:13,320
the the gradient looks right it goes

382
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:15,270
from you know dark to light but the

383
00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:17,610
color values are incorrect and so

384
00:15:17,610 --> 00:15:20,100
there's been a piece of our Photoshop

385
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:21,630
layer styles that we've been ignoring

386
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:25,080
this whole time blend modes and so let's

387
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:27,150
talk about blend modes real quick the

388
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:28,830
blend modes are there a way to combine

389
00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:30,750
two different colors of background

390
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:32,910
foreground color together using

391
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:35,090
different mathematical functions and so

392
00:15:35,090 --> 00:15:38,130
when I was kind of working out trying to

393
00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:39,480
figure out a way to programmatically

394
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,010
solve these problems that didn't have to

395
00:15:41,010 --> 00:15:44,580
rely on on just style guides you know

396
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:45,870
when I was reading about blend modes and

397
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:47,340
I'm like oh it's all just math functions

398
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:49,230
like the light bulb went off in my head

399
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:50,970
I was like oh well they're just math

400
00:15:50,970 --> 00:15:53,130
functions than we can create you know we

401
00:15:53,130 --> 00:15:55,110
can create this incest we can recreate

402
00:15:55,110 --> 00:15:56,010
all these things

403
00:15:56,010 --> 00:15:59,220
so these are three examples of of common

404
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:01,500
blend modes the first one is normal

405
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:04,050
which is like no blend mode actually so

406
00:16:04,050 --> 00:16:05,640
it just returns to foreground color so

407
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:07,320
what you what you put in is what you get

408
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:10,410
but the second one is our x mode which

409
00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:12,870
is a darkening blend mode and this

410
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:14,970
combines the two colors together decay

411
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:18,780
to create kind of a nice dark rusty sort

412
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:23,220
of more a darker color basically and so

413
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:25,200
finally but what our designers wanted us

414
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:27,540
to use is the overlay blend mode which

415
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:29,940
is a contrast blend mode so the light

416
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:31,560
colors get lighter in the dark colors

417
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,660
get darker it's uh it's actually a

418
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:35,640
pretty sexy blend mode i think overlay

419
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:39,000
is one of the best but so there are a

420
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,400
few limitations with these blend mode

421
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,050
functions you have to know the

422
00:16:43,050 --> 00:16:44,490
foreground color in the background color

423
00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:46,590
ahead of time and Photoshop all that

424
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:49,620
stuff is sort of done on the fly so for

425
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:52,010
like drop shadows and stuff like that

426
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:54,180
blend modes might not be a good choice

427
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:55,920
because they're outside of the element

428
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,510
so you don't necessarily know what the

429
00:16:57,510 --> 00:16:59,700
background color is going to be but for

430
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:01,200
gradient overlay is we know what our

431
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,420
base background colors and we know the

432
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:04,890
gradient that we want to put in front of

433
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:07,020
it so blend modes work perfectly there

434
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:11,240
so let's update our gradient overlay

435
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:13,470
conversion and so this time instead of

436
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:14,940
we're going to loop through all the

437
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:16,320
colors but instead of just returning

438
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:18,060
that color what we're going to do is

439
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:19,290
we're going to blend it with our

440
00:17:19,290 --> 00:17:20,640
background color first and then we're

441
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,260
going to return that blended color and

442
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:24,870
so this has been Turing I turned this

443
00:17:24,870 --> 00:17:26,820
into a compass extension too so if you

444
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:28,920
want to use this you can go on my github

445
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:31,950
account and check it out but so let's

446
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:34,710
put that into our our project now and if

447
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:36,630
we when we use those blend modes and we

448
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:39,150
compile our CSS our button looks perfect

449
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:41,700
so now we've created a tool kit that

450
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:44,610
allows us to translate our designs from

451
00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:48,210
Photoshop to CSS flawlessly with you

452
00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:50,250
know a hundred percent confidence and so

453
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:52,200
we used like we used to have a problem

454
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,700
we're like every time a button got

455
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:55,080
created on the site we'd have to go

456
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:57,090
through and do visual cue a and there

457
00:17:57,090 --> 00:17:59,070
were so many times where it was just

458
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:00,570
like well the drop shadow isn't right

459
00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:03,060
but now with these with sass and with

460
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:05,430
the with these functions we we can just

461
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:07,320
have confidence that everything is going

462
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,690
to work perfectly and so no

463
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:11,129
project is complete without a little bit

464
00:18:11,129 --> 00:18:14,370
of refactoring so let's go and see how

465
00:18:14,370 --> 00:18:16,440
we can make things work a little bit

466
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:19,950
better there's a lot of redundancy here

467
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:21,269
like there's a lot of like the

468
00:18:21,269 --> 00:18:23,789
background color is a repeated a bunch

469
00:18:23,789 --> 00:18:24,990
of times and if we want to make a new

470
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:27,029
button we'd have to copy all this but

471
00:18:27,029 --> 00:18:28,529
what we a better way to do it would be

472
00:18:28,529 --> 00:18:30,690
to take all that code and put it into a

473
00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:32,610
mix and that takes a background color as

474
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:37,529
a as a parameter and so now we can style

475
00:18:37,529 --> 00:18:40,159
a button with one line of code and

476
00:18:40,159 --> 00:18:42,299
creating new buttons stuff that like

477
00:18:42,299 --> 00:18:44,610
buttons and colors that we didn't think

478
00:18:44,610 --> 00:18:47,460
of originally is easy and all of our

479
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:49,799
design logic is always followed and we

480
00:18:49,799 --> 00:18:51,419
can be confident that everything works

481
00:18:51,419 --> 00:18:54,139
perfectly which i think is pretty badass

482
00:18:54,139 --> 00:18:58,500
so so this is kind of shows the power of

483
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,330
sass in the way that like once you start

484
00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:01,830
using preprocessors how you can start

485
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:04,889
thinking about CSS differently and how

486
00:19:04,889 --> 00:19:07,049
you can think about designing your site

487
00:19:07,049 --> 00:19:10,500
I think with preprocessors we can we

488
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:13,169
should start relying less on style

489
00:19:13,169 --> 00:19:15,149
guides and designers and developers

490
00:19:15,149 --> 00:19:16,950
should be working together to build

491
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:19,350
reusable systems that translate their

492
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:21,389
designs flawlessly it means we can work

493
00:19:21,389 --> 00:19:23,610
faster and we can also be more confident

494
00:19:23,610 --> 00:19:25,799
that our subtle design details are going

495
00:19:25,799 --> 00:19:31,270
to translate perfectly thanks guys
