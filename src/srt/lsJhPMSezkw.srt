1
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:08,470

so how's the ER the Wi-Fi holding up

2
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:12,100
here good awesome because my my

3
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:15,670
presentation uses none of its ah so

4
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:19,619
how's that for an introduction question

5
00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:24,610
so anyway so it's it's actually a very

6
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:26,290
important question because I've gone to

7
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:29,710
a lot of conferences lately where where

8
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:32,259
the the Internet is suspect at best and

9
00:00:32,259 --> 00:00:34,180
what you're finding is people have their

10
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:37,300
Dropbox active everything else active

11
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:40,239
and it's in its causes your your

12
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:43,659
complete system to go down so how would

13
00:00:43,659 --> 00:00:47,800
you like I instead to be able to create

14
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:50,170
an app that shares data with everybody

15
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:52,809
else without requiring all of the the

16
00:00:52,809 --> 00:00:54,969
cell phone and/or Wi-Fi infrastructure

17
00:00:54,969 --> 00:00:57,819
and not only that but I just want to

18
00:00:57,819 --> 00:00:59,289
kind of change the way we think about

19
00:00:59,289 --> 00:01:03,460
the web and especially the pier web who

20
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:06,100
reads the user end user agreements when

21
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:10,149
you actually install some software Wow

22
00:01:10,149 --> 00:01:13,030
one person all right do you realize how

23
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:14,950
much data you're giving away a personal

24
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:17,380
data you're giving away okay she

25
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:20,189
realizes firstborn and all of that

26
00:01:20,189 --> 00:01:23,560
beautiful and you know especially when

27
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:27,640
it comes to to the topics of the pier

28
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:29,710
web you know people think about data

29
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:31,600
loss they think about data theft and

30
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,520
they think about things like Edward

31
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,640
Snowden in terms of how much data people

32
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,329
are really collecting so as was stated I

33
00:01:40,329 --> 00:01:44,590
am indeed a principal sde at this

34
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:47,560
aforementioned company and I'd like to

35
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,149
think that I'm bringing a little bit

36
00:01:49,149 --> 00:01:56,500
more metal to the company so most people

37
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:59,229
recognize me mostly for this particular

38
00:01:59,229 --> 00:02:02,200
project and so I'm starting to to kind

39
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,299
of get more away from this and on to

40
00:02:04,299 --> 00:02:07,030
other things but what's very fascinating

41
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:10,030
about this project is the fact that now

42
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:12,370
Google and Netflix are the biggest

43
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:13,900
contributors to its who would have

44
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:17,349
guessed that Google and Netflix and

45
00:02:17,349 --> 00:02:18,910
Microsoft would be working on

46
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:24,700
same project all at one time so really

47
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,480
this is about starting conversations and

48
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:32,530
back in 2011-2012 timeframe you know we

49
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:35,740
we had this this great idea Chris

50
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:37,180
Williams and I have you know how do we

51
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:39,730
change the world how do we as software

52
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:42,730
developers fundamentally change change

53
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:45,280
how how we interoperate with the world

54
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,670
and everyone was welcome whether they

55
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:51,640
drank alcohol or not it was just a

56
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:54,070
convenient name since we happen to meet

57
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:57,730
at a bar when we started that but that

58
00:02:57,730 --> 00:03:00,310
ended up turning into robots comp which

59
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:02,140
I think a lot of people I've seen a lot

60
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:04,630
of swag around so that's really kind of

61
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:06,970
cool that a lot of people who came here

62
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:10,840
also supported us there but going back

63
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:14,350
to Cascadia j/s 2012 Chris Williams came

64
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:16,060
up with this talk to basically

65
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:19,330
challenged us all and to say what are we

66
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:21,460
doing as developers are we creating the

67
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:24,130
next flappy bird to you know create a

68
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:26,350
few moments of joy or are we

69
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:28,570
fundamentally doing something to for

70
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:31,180
betterment of society as developers are

71
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:33,700
we helping grow new developers are we

72
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:37,390
helping in areas of hard science those

73
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:40,510
kinds of questions and so that's really

74
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:43,720
kind of a mantle that I picked up and

75
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:47,350
ran with so let's just talk a little bit

76
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:51,010
about the Internet of Things you know it

77
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:53,140
really is about the things and how

78
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:54,850
they're they're connected to each other

79
00:03:54,850 --> 00:04:00,100
whether it's a the your nest that you

80
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:03,580
have at home or a raspberry pi you know

81
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:05,530
quite honestly a lot of that's very

82
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:07,209
interesting I mean I have literally a

83
00:04:07,209 --> 00:04:10,510
stack of these these boards at home I

84
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:12,489
have no idea what to do with them all

85
00:04:12,489 --> 00:04:15,100
but I am a collector and I'm a maker of

86
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:18,640
basically just about anything but what's

87
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,980
what's really kind of interesting about

88
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:23,470
this is to see a lot of people building

89
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:24,730
a lot of really really fascinating

90
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:27,640
things but yet leaving the the door wide

91
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,480
open on

92
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,930
purity which really really troubles me

93
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:33,820
but I think when it comes to the

94
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:35,170
Internet of Things I think the most

95
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:37,300
important piece that you're that you're

96
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:41,710
missing is this your phone your phone is

97
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:44,320
largely who you are nowadays in terms of

98
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,390
its your central access point for pretty

99
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:48,550
much anything whether it's paying for

100
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:50,260
something whether it's controlling your

101
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:52,840
house whether it's opening doors etc

102
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:55,720
your phone is usually where it's at and

103
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,940
so that's why I really wanted to focus

104
00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:01,270
on on the phone as being that that's

105
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:04,930
that piece that really changes what I OT

106
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:09,910
is so taking that that idea from Chris

107
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:12,160
and really let's let's take on some big

108
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:16,630
challenges here so for example could we

109
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:19,090
reinvent manufacturing as we do as we

110
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:21,310
think of it today and the answer is

111
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:24,850
absolutely I for example these factories

112
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:27,310
have millions of thousands of machines

113
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:29,440
that are all trying are all

114
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,720
interconnected and all need to transmit

115
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:35,800
data so how do you actually wire those

116
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:38,260
things up and save these companies a lot

117
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:40,210
of money millions upon millions of

118
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:42,640
dollars because these companies you know

119
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:45,130
keep each piece of their hardware for

120
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:47,920
years you know 20 years or more how do

121
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:51,310
you allow them to modernize without

122
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:54,790
costing them a fortune here's another

123
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:56,650
one how do we improve the lives of

124
00:05:56,650 --> 00:05:59,260
communication of everybody regardless of

125
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:03,520
economic status whether you are the

126
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,880
whether you're in the the lower economic

127
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,580
brackets or the upper economic brackets

128
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:11,650
you should have the same access to

129
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:14,950
communication everybody else does that's

130
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:17,100
fundamentally important to me is that

131
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:19,810
everybody should have access to to

132
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:23,920
information and regardless of whether a

133
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,540
nation state decides that you should

134
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:28,960
have internet access or not so that's

135
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,610
more of a political issue but I think

136
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:33,430
it's still fundamentally fundamentally

137
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:35,620
interesting especially some of the

138
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:37,450
research that's going on now around

139
00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:39,730
radio white space and allowing the

140
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:41,950
internet to pre pretty much anywhere

141
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:44,710
but I think also helping in times of

142
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:48,850
crisis IOT has a huge huge role to play

143
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:52,290
in in helping in times of crisis from

144
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:54,760
because what happens the first thing

145
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,920
that happens is that your right is the

146
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,660
cell phone infrastructure completely

147
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:01,090
fails your communication infrastructure

148
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:04,500
completely fails how do you fix that

149
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:10,030
here's the answer IOT and the phone and

150
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:12,910
that so not only it will help first

151
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:15,580
responders be able to find who is in

152
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:17,980
need of who is in need of assistance but

153
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:20,440
also help people find and connect with

154
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,940
their loved ones to make sure that

155
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:23,980
they're not panicking and they know

156
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:28,630
exactly what's going on and indeed going

157
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:32,050
even further saving lives because as

158
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:34,180
people such as our reporters without

159
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:37,300
borders go into hostile zones what

160
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:39,940
happens well they leave behind all sorts

161
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:41,980
of interesting tracing data about

162
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:44,560
themselves why because your phone of

163
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:47,050
course is emitting any number of pieces

164
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:49,540
of information but if you use it

165
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:52,030
specifically only as a peer device that

166
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:54,970
doesn't happen and that's why I think

167
00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:59,800
it's very important now most of all I

168
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,810
believe when we're developing these

169
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:03,640
these kinds of applications especially

170
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:06,370
as we're building things internet of

171
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:09,700
things we believe especially I believe

172
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:12,880
that you as a user have a bill of rights

173
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:17,410
and that we as ethical developers must

174
00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:22,540
abide by them so i will i will just coin

175
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:26,740
it as the devices Bill of Rights now as

176
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:29,730
part of this we're working with with

177
00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:32,800
Bluetooth Bluetooth Low Energy and in

178
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:35,800
Wi-Fi direct per job to provide that

179
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:38,530
local discovery mechanism the ability to

180
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:42,669
do to discover who's around you I is is

181
00:08:42,669 --> 00:08:45,790
is both fascinating but yet terrifying

182
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:48,790
at the same point so i'll try to i'll

183
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:51,670
try to enumerate exactly those kinds of

184
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:53,800
Rights that you should have as we're

185
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,790
developing these these Apple

186
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:58,250
Asians and I'll and I'll refer to Kim

187
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:00,410
Cameron who is a computer scientist who

188
00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:05,270
works on identity issues so that that

189
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:07,070
you have a basic understanding of what

190
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:10,780
we are trying to go for so the so

191
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:14,660
Cameron's laws of identity the first law

192
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:16,880
is that the position the solution

193
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,500
discloses the least amount of

194
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:21,920
information and the best limits its use

195
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:27,260
of the for its stable long-term use so

196
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:30,470
what that really means is that the the

197
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:32,750
users information does not go out on the

198
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:35,530
air unless they specifically say so and

199
00:09:35,530 --> 00:09:38,450
then users also must be prominently

200
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:41,150
notified when exactly it is going out

201
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:44,750
there you know discovery is different

202
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:47,090
than any type of other services because

203
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:50,000
it has imminent dangers along with it

204
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,530
why because for example stalking

205
00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:57,170
harassment and so forth when you're

206
00:09:57,170 --> 00:10:00,350
you're when you're broadcasting this

207
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:02,570
information you're opening yourself up

208
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:05,420
to that so users must be able to of

209
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:08,270
course disable this this kind of feature

210
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:10,820
and they must specify constraints on

211
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:13,310
that such as if I'm leaving work I don't

212
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:15,980
want to be not notified anymore so

213
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:18,820
that's where it's really key is to is to

214
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:23,450
to help people keep boundaries because

215
00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:25,550
if someone's being harassed especially

216
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:28,250
over these these kinds of programs what

217
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:30,620
kind of recourse do they have well

218
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:32,480
turning it off isn't exactly the right

219
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,300
answer but certainly limiting access to

220
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:39,860
to the harasser certainly does now

221
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:44,500
that's that is a total key part of of

222
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:47,390
limiting harassment but it's also about

223
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:50,720
limiting people's access to to getting

224
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:55,610
people's locations as well so the second

225
00:10:55,610 --> 00:10:58,520
law is pretty you know pretty

226
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:02,900
self-explanatory I and so you have this

227
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:06,920
and then you have the digital identity

228
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:09,100
systems must be designed so disclose

229
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:13,750
identify is limited and only justify a

230
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:16,950
justifiable place given a relationship

231
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:20,410
now these to the previous law in this

232
00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:22,990
law kind of work together thats the

233
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:25,420
users data only must be exposed in the

234
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:27,430
smallest amounts of the smallest number

235
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:31,260
of devices within the users desire

236
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:37,090
that's it now number four is a really

237
00:11:37,090 --> 00:11:39,160
huge kind of law and I don't expect

238
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:41,440
everyone to read all of this but

239
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:45,880
basically the users ID of the users ID

240
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:48,070
that you're giving out must not

241
00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:50,170
necessarily be their true name but just

242
00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:52,210
something that represents who they are

243
00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:54,940
for immediate purpose only not to keep

244
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:58,600
it out there in perpetuity and then of

245
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,640
course you also must keep it open that

246
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:03,190
other people can use other providers for

247
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:09,010
your particular application now the

248
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:12,040
sixth law is once again rather long but

249
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:14,110
what this really means is that it has to

250
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:17,200
be understandable to humans well I don't

251
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,000
think that's very possible so we'll just

252
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:24,370
keep on moving the seventh law is is

253
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:27,280
that we will use our technology to

254
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:31,900
enable itself and the community to use

255
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:33,550
the identities that will be separate

256
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:37,000
from all other identities so hopefully

257
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,690
basically will convince others that we

258
00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:43,330
are we are providing an identity system

259
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:46,450
that other people will start to to to

260
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:50,140
buy into so you might ask yourself you

261
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:52,870
know is this all this privacy a bunch of

262
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:55,920
nonsense am i full of crap up here

263
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:59,800
possibly i but there are a lot of people

264
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,810
that still say if you've gotten nothing

265
00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:04,750
to HOD nothing to hide then you've got

266
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:07,270
nothing to fear that's one of the most

267
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:09,100
ridiculous statements I've ever heard is

268
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:11,050
because why don't you just give me your

269
00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:13,960
email password your slack github and and

270
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,910
everything else and i'll just post it to

271
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:19,690
your employer to your to your insurers

272
00:13:19,690 --> 00:13:22,570
and everyone else still have nothing to

273
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:22,899
hide

274
00:13:22,899 --> 00:13:26,050
I don't think so but you also might say

275
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:29,680
well our phones themselves broadcast a

276
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:30,970
lot of information what are they

277
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:33,639
broadcast well they broadcast not only a

278
00:13:33,639 --> 00:13:35,920
self cell phone number but also the

279
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,290
equipment ID that it has and your

280
00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:40,569
subscriber number based upon who you're

281
00:13:40,569 --> 00:13:44,860
using so how do you actually minimize a

282
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:46,600
lot of that well when we're talking in

283
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,730
privacy terms we're saying first do no

284
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:51,699
harm make them more no more vulnerable

285
00:13:51,699 --> 00:13:56,949
than they already were so it's my belief

286
00:13:56,949 --> 00:13:58,839
that a lot of these addresses that we

287
00:13:58,839 --> 00:14:00,730
have right now are kind of you know

288
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:02,679
permanent but I think that they can be

289
00:14:02,679 --> 00:14:04,329
random in the future and there's no

290
00:14:04,329 --> 00:14:07,629
reason why they shouldn't be now when it

291
00:14:07,629 --> 00:14:09,459
comes to owning your own data I think

292
00:14:09,459 --> 00:14:11,470
it's really really key is the fact that

293
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:14,829
now we have a way of of talking to one

294
00:14:14,829 --> 00:14:18,550
another that we own our own data we are

295
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:20,170
not sending it to Facebook we're not

296
00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:21,910
sending it to Twitter we can send it

297
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:24,279
back and forth and keep the ownership of

298
00:14:24,279 --> 00:14:27,699
our of the data by ourselves what kind

299
00:14:27,699 --> 00:14:29,769
of implications does that have well for

300
00:14:29,769 --> 00:14:31,240
example if you have something like this

301
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:33,730
around your house where each of the your

302
00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:35,529
things are emitting data well you can

303
00:14:35,529 --> 00:14:37,540
start to collect it on your phone and

304
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:39,459
then you can decide whether you send

305
00:14:39,459 --> 00:14:46,839
that data off to somebody else so what

306
00:14:46,839 --> 00:14:48,670
we came up with was called the tally

307
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:51,370
project and that was these to serve as

308
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:53,410
the basis of what we're building here

309
00:14:53,410 --> 00:14:58,120
and that's it and it's a Indian and

310
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:01,389
nepalese term and it's basically four

311
00:15:01,389 --> 00:15:04,480
plates and usually what the it's a plate

312
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:09,040
of various different things such as as

313
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:12,370
holding six flavors of sweet salter

314
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:16,299
bitter astringent and spicy now we feel

315
00:15:16,299 --> 00:15:20,379
that the ideas behind all of that become

316
00:15:20,379 --> 00:15:22,689
very very interesting especially as as

317
00:15:22,689 --> 00:15:25,929
we start to think about privacy I access

318
00:15:25,929 --> 00:15:28,149
control and so forth each of those are

319
00:15:28,149 --> 00:15:30,459
little dishes in the big thing so let's

320
00:15:30,459 --> 00:15:33,069
actually show you enough of my my

321
00:15:33,069 --> 00:15:35,350
blathering on my soapbox yes i will type

322
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:36,250
in my password

323
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:41,950
is 1234 don't judge me ah and so what we

324
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:44,410
have here is we have we have a device

325
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:47,260
here our Nexus 6 who would have guessed

326
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:49,210
a microsoft guy would have a nexus but

327
00:15:49,210 --> 00:15:53,880
here is and we have a nexus 9 tablet I

328
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:57,400
think all right and so we what we can do

329
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,230
is we can start to send messages back

330
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:02,530
and forth so for example I can type in

331
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:07,600
je s comp here and sure enough as

332
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:11,020
immediately showed up right here and and

333
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:13,330
how is that possible because if you can

334
00:16:13,330 --> 00:16:15,430
see right there there is no sim card in

335
00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:18,490
here nor am I connected to any Wi-Fi the

336
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:19,990
only thing that I that I have running

337
00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:22,900
right here is is Bluetooth right now so

338
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:25,960
how it works is is that it actually uses

339
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:29,650
Wi-Fi direct for discovery purposes and

340
00:16:29,650 --> 00:16:31,960
then it uses Bluetooth to do the data

341
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:34,360
syncing and why let's actually go

342
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,640
through a little bit of that of how we

343
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:42,430
actually built it so what we thought is

344
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:44,920
is well gee this could be a bunch of

345
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,510
Lego blocks that we can just put

346
00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:49,170
together and why I'm here is because

347
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:52,650
well you always bet on Jas because well

348
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:55,990
everybody does right that's what

349
00:16:55,990 --> 00:16:58,180
everybody builds their solutions on so

350
00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:02,170
we might as well follow suit but just as

351
00:17:02,170 --> 00:17:04,870
well thinking about it your phone here

352
00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:08,020
is more powerful than servers that you

353
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:10,689
would buy 10 years ago it has so much

354
00:17:10,689 --> 00:17:13,930
capability and so much storage that why

355
00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:16,750
wouldn't you use it as a server in fact

356
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:18,579
companies such as uber and others are

357
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:21,490
already doing just that to offload a lot

358
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:23,459
of computation and a lot of storage

359
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:27,220
directly off onto your phone so we

360
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:30,340
really want to be able to to take full

361
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:33,130
advantage of everything from down to the

362
00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:34,600
encryption stack to all the way

363
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:37,750
communicating its with the the Bluetooth

364
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:42,310
and Wi-Fi directly in node but note

365
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:45,700
itself doesn't exactly do that so

366
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:47,710
unfortunately since note is tied

367
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:50,880
directly to to VA

368
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:54,640
we want instead to run on every device

369
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:59,380
and JX core which is a kind of a forked

370
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:02,020
from from New bisa allows you to do just

371
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:05,590
that it has a number of additional

372
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:08,590
features that regular node doesn't have

373
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:11,650
such a shared memory concurrency and so

374
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:14,200
forth but but the the biggest part is

375
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:16,090
the fact that you can swap out which

376
00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:20,830
which particular JavaScript engine that

377
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:23,290
you happen to be using and why that's

378
00:18:23,290 --> 00:18:25,780
important is because now if you go to

379
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:30,640
iTunes or if you go to Google Play guess

380
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:34,630
what you can start shipping these kinds

381
00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:38,290
of node apps today they have they have

382
00:18:38,290 --> 00:18:40,300
right here the the Wi-Fi shopping list

383
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:43,000
and this is from the from the J explore

384
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,540
folks on how you can just share with

385
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:49,300
share with your friends I a shopping

386
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:52,900
list over Wi-Fi so like I said you have

387
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:54,940
all of this capability right in the palm

388
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:58,780
of your hands already today now how did

389
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:01,330
we actually deploy it well thanks to

390
00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:06,130
Brian larousse liver and himself we have

391
00:19:06,130 --> 00:19:09,010
Apache Cordova which allows us to

392
00:19:09,010 --> 00:19:10,660
basically use it as a packaging

393
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:14,230
mechanism for us to deliver deliver the

394
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:16,600
data as we need to but it's not that

395
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,429
we're actually using any of the api's

396
00:19:18,429 --> 00:19:22,090
we're actually writing all of our all of

397
00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:24,370
our stuff as as node modules there's no

398
00:19:24,370 --> 00:19:29,190
real cordova magic happening here and

399
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:32,260
when I was showing you the the post card

400
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:34,420
app that we have here which by the way

401
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:37,360
if you go to github.com / thali project

402
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,910
/ post card app you can actually run

403
00:19:39,910 --> 00:19:44,530
this yourself what's what's neat about

404
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:49,300
this and even though the thereof I was

405
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:50,820
showing you just you know how

406
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:52,870
instantaneously this was going between

407
00:19:52,870 --> 00:19:55,150
this devices you have to think it's

408
00:19:55,150 --> 00:19:57,040
actually going through node and it's

409
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:59,169
going through pouch DB to synchronize

410
00:19:59,169 --> 00:20:01,090
with one another but yet it's blazingly

411
00:20:01,090 --> 00:20:03,760
fast and that's really cool too

412
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:07,800
see and really it's about enabling

413
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:11,290
communication so what exactly are our

414
00:20:11,290 --> 00:20:14,020
phones and tablets today well what are

415
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:16,840
they the radios there are any number of

416
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:19,060
radios whether it's Wi-Fi whether it's

417
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:22,000
Bluetooth it all has the same capability

418
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,440
in terms of communicating with one

419
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:27,160
another so why not be able to use those

420
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:29,680
things directly instead of having to to

421
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:33,040
use the the wife a public Wi-Fi or

422
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:37,870
something like that now for security

423
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:40,600
obviously if you're carrying the most

424
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,910
important parts about your your company

425
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:45,310
your most private details you obviously

426
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:48,670
wanted secure so for that we're using

427
00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:52,720
tos and public keys so for each of us

428
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:55,210
when you install one of these apps will

429
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:57,490
get a public key and that will be used

430
00:20:57,490 --> 00:20:59,610
for authentication and authorization

431
00:20:59,610 --> 00:21:02,290
purposes and not only that but we

432
00:21:02,290 --> 00:21:05,020
actually will deep down to the pouch DB

433
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:12,070
level enforce the enforce those ACLs now

434
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:14,620
a good question to ask especially when

435
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:16,930
you're doing identity exchange with with

436
00:21:16,930 --> 00:21:19,540
a particular device such as this is how

437
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:23,320
do you get exchange IDs with one another

438
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:27,210
without absolutely hating yourself and

439
00:21:27,210 --> 00:21:29,860
that was a really hard question for us

440
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:32,170
especially because originally right oh

441
00:21:32,170 --> 00:21:34,390
yeah QR codes that's easy enough just

442
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:36,790
walk up to another device hold it up and

443
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:39,550
maybe they'll line up and and then we'll

444
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:44,410
have a complete identity exchange turns

445
00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:46,000
out that wasn't really easy at all

446
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,880
because I it it's rather terrible

447
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:52,630
actually so what we came up with was an

448
00:21:52,630 --> 00:21:55,710
idea using the coin flipping algorithm

449
00:21:55,710 --> 00:21:58,900
so that we could exchange public keys

450
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:02,080
back and forth with one another and yes

451
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:04,960
there are there are attack vectors that

452
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,450
maybe a one-in-a-million chance that

453
00:22:07,450 --> 00:22:09,790
you'll get a man-in-the-middle attack

454
00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:11,620
but for the most part we are using these

455
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:15,190
keys in such a way that we only

456
00:22:15,190 --> 00:22:17,100
advertise it when we're

457
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:18,780
do identity exchange with someone so

458
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:21,630
that's a very very small window and not

459
00:22:21,630 --> 00:22:26,280
only that but it's it's a small window

460
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:28,049
and chances are if there's a

461
00:22:28,049 --> 00:22:29,910
man-in-the-middle attack it just

462
00:22:29,910 --> 00:22:32,370
wouldn't happen at the right time it

463
00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:33,990
would have to be very very coordinated

464
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:36,450
so really what we want is we want

465
00:22:36,450 --> 00:22:38,820
something that just easily says that I

466
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:42,630
give this to tracy has one and I have

467
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:45,770
one and I said ok my number is 123456

468
00:22:45,770 --> 00:22:48,840
she says okay yes my number is also one

469
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:50,669
two three four five six let's go ahead

470
00:22:50,669 --> 00:22:55,169
and and pair these devices together so

471
00:22:55,169 --> 00:22:59,159
that's that it is probably the least

472
00:22:59,159 --> 00:23:01,799
painful at way we could think about

473
00:23:01,799 --> 00:23:05,460
doing security now when we're talking

474
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:07,770
about doing these devices because we're

475
00:23:07,770 --> 00:23:09,510
talking about supporting this on both

476
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:12,750
iOS and Android right now so basically

477
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:15,090
you can go out you can download Holly

478
00:23:15,090 --> 00:23:19,710
and you can run run it today but what's

479
00:23:19,710 --> 00:23:22,559
what's really fascinating is is the nut

480
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:24,870
the sheer number of Android devices and

481
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:27,299
the sheer number sheer number of

482
00:23:27,299 --> 00:23:29,190
versions of that we want to make sure

483
00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:31,590
that every time we do a delivery that

484
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:34,289
we're not breaking something so this is

485
00:23:34,289 --> 00:23:37,679
actually our CI environment here which

486
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:41,250
is love as you can see ton of phones

487
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:43,650
just all hooked up to a single server

488
00:23:43,650 --> 00:23:46,440
and every time we do a github push sure

489
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:48,780
enough it hits against our CI server and

490
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:52,049
spits out the results as a gist so we

491
00:23:52,049 --> 00:23:57,059
live and die by this now where are we

492
00:23:57,059 --> 00:24:01,020
going in the future well that's a that's

493
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:03,210
kind of a hard question because we there

494
00:24:03,210 --> 00:24:05,429
are a lot of ideas of where we're going

495
00:24:05,429 --> 00:24:07,320
right now we're still kind of an

496
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:10,590
experimental platform for building these

497
00:24:10,590 --> 00:24:13,820
pure apps but there are very very

498
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:16,320
concrete things that we want to do for

499
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,750
example we will want to do mesh

500
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:20,700
networking so for example if I want to

501
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:22,350
start to send data to the back of the

502
00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:24,780
room I might not have range to do that

503
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:27,240
automatically what instead I would do is

504
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:29,130
I would send the data at halfway around

505
00:24:29,130 --> 00:24:30,160
the room to someone

506
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:32,470
Alice and then send it via another

507
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:35,470
couple people until it finally reaches

508
00:24:35,470 --> 00:24:38,170
its destination in the meantime it's

509
00:24:38,170 --> 00:24:40,870
still encrypted at rest so you might see

510
00:24:40,870 --> 00:24:43,300
a little file on your on your device but

511
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:46,060
you can't actually open it and the other

512
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:49,120
thing is is getting around on the

513
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,560
general internet so if we're available

514
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:52,600
on the general internet then we can use

515
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:55,240
something like tour for example to

516
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:57,850
completely hide your traffic using tor

517
00:24:57,850 --> 00:25:00,040
hidden services not only to hide your

518
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:02,500
traffic but to also get around the rules

519
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:06,490
that most people have on their most

520
00:25:06,490 --> 00:25:08,110
people have on their on their local

521
00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:10,420
routers which is to not allow local

522
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:12,460
traffic to go back and forth so we can

523
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:15,760
get around all of that that we're also

524
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,800
investigating for example radio

525
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:20,650
whitespace Wi-Fi and allowing that to be

526
00:25:20,650 --> 00:25:22,990
used as well and what that is is

527
00:25:22,990 --> 00:25:25,390
basically it's using unused channels

528
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:28,270
within Wi-Fi and it's able to right now

529
00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:31,270
we're working with microsoft research to

530
00:25:31,270 --> 00:25:35,050
to enable for example indian villages to

531
00:25:35,050 --> 00:25:37,960
talk to one another by using by setting

532
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:40,810
up these Wi-Fi beacons between the two

533
00:25:40,810 --> 00:25:43,570
just using that white space that nobody

534
00:25:43,570 --> 00:25:48,190
else uses right now so as I said this is

535
00:25:48,190 --> 00:25:51,610
no more than what you saw here than just

536
00:25:51,610 --> 00:25:54,850
an NPM module so all you really have to

537
00:25:54,850 --> 00:25:59,410
do is type mjx using JX core NPM install

538
00:25:59,410 --> 00:26:03,250
thali and you're ready to go now you can

539
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:05,890
also go and visit visit our sites at

540
00:26:05,890 --> 00:26:10,560
tully project.org but together I think

541
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:14,400
we can make the the pier web grade again

542
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:19,710
so with that thank you very much
