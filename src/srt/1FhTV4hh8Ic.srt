so i would like to tell you a story

3
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:21,180
about the firefox OS and html5 games

00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:23,590
quick question how many of you heard

5
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:29,500
about Firefox OS awesome right how many

6
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:34,530
of you are html5 game developers ok feo

7
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:40,780
ok cool so my name is Angie mizzou and I

8
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:43,450
started a small company called enclaves

9
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:47,290
games in which I just make html5 games

10
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:50,830
for fun it's not even a company at it's

11
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:54,850
just you know working on something that

12
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:59,170
I love in every time I ran the jest 18k

13
00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:02,970
Games competition that will end tomorrow

14
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:05,259
any one of you heard about the

15
00:01:05,259 --> 00:01:12,720
competition ok nice thank you I run a

16
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:16,119
meetup scene were so game of joyous

17
00:01:16,119 --> 00:01:20,260
meetups only a couple of them it's not

18
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:26,550
so so big so I also write on the block I

19
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:30,270
can find me on Twitter and on github and

20
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:33,780
I will tell you about the game I created

21
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:37,420
with my friend I did the cutting part

22
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:42,100
and heated the graphics and game I would

23
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:45,159
like to tell you was prepared for the

24
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:50,860
Firefox OS platform especially and the

25
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:53,260
story goes like this it's it's very

26
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:55,990
simple game it's not complicated you

27
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:58,150
just fly with your rocket and avoid the

28
00:01:58,150 --> 00:02:05,260
asteroids so so the idea was to have a

29
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:08,970
very simple game but polished and

30
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:12,500
finished

31
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:16,230
that you can ship the the finished

32
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:19,980
product it was built with impact Gia's

33
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:24,590
game engine quite popular one and

34
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:27,989
optimized for Firefox OS you will seen

35
00:02:27,989 --> 00:02:30,750
in the presentation that it wasn't so is

36
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:35,400
so hard to to prepare the version for

37
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:39,390
the Firefox OS it's very easy and the

38
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:42,629
submit process was also done in a minute

39
00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:49,890
so after a week or two off of time spent

40
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:52,109
on development to submit that in the

41
00:02:52,109 --> 00:02:54,739
marketplace and a few days earlier later

42
00:02:54,739 --> 00:02:57,780
the game was in the marketplace and you

43
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:03,060
could just download it and play so few

44
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:07,799
words about the Firefox OS so it's a

45
00:03:07,799 --> 00:03:10,709
mobile operating system developed by

46
00:03:10,709 --> 00:03:15,540
Mozilla and the thing that that this

47
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:17,250
system is different from the others is

48
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:20,790
that it's built with html5 and

49
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:24,030
JavaScript it's awesome for me for a

50
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:25,980
front-end developer that worked for a

51
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:28,169
couple of years in JavaScript that I

52
00:03:28,169 --> 00:03:31,019
have I can have a whole play operating

53
00:03:31,019 --> 00:03:34,260
system on my mobile device that runs

54
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:38,280
java script I can change one CSS style

55
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:42,480
and the icons will be squares so it's

56
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,090
very easy to customize its open sourced

57
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:48,030
it's on github you can check it you can

58
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:52,250
commit your changes as I said you can

59
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:56,310
easily modify it for now it's targeted

60
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:58,590
for low-end devices so it will work on

61
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:03,840
our cheap phones but there is a plan to

62
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:08,069
have devices with more hardware better

63
00:04:08,069 --> 00:04:12,359
hardware and its new all the consistent

64
00:04:12,359 --> 00:04:17,340
because you don't have to well if you

65
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:19,440
have experience with html5 and

66
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,959
JavaScript you're already prepared to

67
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:25,530
build applications for

68
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:30,340
firefox because it's just just the web

69
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:35,430
the problem with the html5 is the

70
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:38,160
question is if it's ready for for gaming

71
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,040
because there are some problems that we

72
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:47,580
face but there are also good things it's

73
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:50,130
it html5 is free of course you don't

74
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:53,100
have to pay for a license you can create

75
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:57,600
a gaming one code base and just deploy

76
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,350
it in different environments as I said

77
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:03,810
earlier there are already developer

78
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:06,500
student have to learn a new language

79
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:10,980
it's cross-platform you can create the

80
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:13,530
game and put it in five stars different

81
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:18,180
stores and only the only thing that you

82
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:22,500
need is just a browser so you can play

83
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:25,400
your game on a smartphone on a tablet on

84
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:30,450
your laptop maybe on a TV maybe on your

85
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:33,450
fridge if you want to if it have a

86
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:37,560
browser the distribution distribution is

87
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,780
very easy because you can just send the

88
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:43,260
link to the game chatting with your

89
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:46,830
friend and he can play it to 17 he don't

90
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:51,930
need to have any plugins to play it and

91
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:54,600
it's easy to learn from far from the

92
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:57,840
code you get instant access you don't

93
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:02,760
have to wait two weeks to have your next

94
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,740
version except that you just change your

95
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:07,830
code and refresh the browser and the

96
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:10,680
changes are there and its story

97
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:13,710
independent you don't have to stick to

98
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:17,539
the one store you can share the game

99
00:06:17,539 --> 00:06:22,919
wherever you want so the Firefox OS just

100
00:06:22,919 --> 00:06:25,830
takes the good good parts of the html5

101
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:30,570
and gives the hardware the technology on

102
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:32,220
which the

103
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:37,930
the applications the the camera so at

104
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:41,340
least for me at the Firefox OS is just

105
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:45,040
the mobile web on which I will I was

106
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:50,890
waiting for some words about the weak

107
00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:53,290
spots because the technology isn't

108
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:56,200
perfect there are still some problems

109
00:06:56,200 --> 00:07:00,070
with the audio api performance model

110
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:04,270
cessation and working of line the Web

111
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:08,200
Audio API is looking quite decent it's

112
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,060
it's okay on the desktop machines it's

113
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:15,610
still problem on mobile devices but I

114
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:19,870
think it in a few months it will be

115
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:22,480
better and better because the the the

116
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:24,400
the guys from the specification are

117
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:33,250
working on it the performance there are

118
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:37,540
many accusations that the performance is

119
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:44,290
bad but if you gave the device to which

120
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:48,850
you can have access to from the

121
00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:53,050
JavaScript and access the camera or

122
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:58,540
other contacts etc and other things then

123
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:01,450
the the boost of the performances is

124
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:07,510
quite quite high and the monetization

125
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:11,710
problem if you focus on one store you

126
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:14,560
can optimize everything to make it work

127
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:20,919
there but the the problem is with html5

128
00:08:20,919 --> 00:08:25,140
games that there are still not so many

129
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:28,419
publishers and platforms that help you

130
00:08:28,419 --> 00:08:33,969
sell your game so here the Mozilla

131
00:08:33,969 --> 00:08:35,589
marketplace comes into place and you can

132
00:08:35,589 --> 00:08:37,960
of course sell your game there in the

133
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:41,080
marketplace but as I said earlier it's

134
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:43,690
it's independent from the stars so you

135
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:45,520
can put it there you can put it

136
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,920
your own website you can package it

137
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:51,040
using for example phonegap and put it in

138
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:56,410
the app store so yeah it's it's

139
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:59,830
independent and you can put the in-app

140
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:06,100
purchases using the html5 AP ice of

141
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:09,660
course you can you can add

142
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:13,240
advertisements to the game you can sell

143
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:16,240
the license so there are many many ways

144
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,420
you can monetize the game and it's a

145
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:22,660
getting better and better every month

146
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:27,970
because I am receiving the emails from

147
00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:31,690
the publishers and that they are waiting

148
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:34,660
for for me to make more games because I

149
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:38,380
made one game it's okay I saw the

150
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:45,880
license and there are still not so many

151
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:48,130
developers and many publishers that want

152
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:51,430
working games so it's some it's

153
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:54,700
situation where the publishers are

154
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:56,320
waiting for the developers and need the

155
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:00,190
games so if you start working on the

156
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:02,590
games it won't be a problem to sell the

157
00:10:02,590 --> 00:10:12,900
license and money working offline yeah

158
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:20,110
so theoretically html5 app is website so

159
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:23,590
as a website it's in the internet and it

160
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:27,340
it works in the internet so if you turn

161
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:31,630
off the Wi-Fi it won't work but we have

162
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:37,300
the offline stuff like different

163
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:38,860
technologies that that will help you

164
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:44,030
store your data on the machine of the

165
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:47,900
of the the guy that that browse the

166
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:50,930
website and we'll start the holding all

167
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:55,370
the information and he will he will look

168
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:57,500
at the website when it's offline and it

169
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:03,350
will work the Firefox OS goes further

170
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:06,980
and gives you the possibility to have a

171
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:10,520
package zap so we can just zip out the

172
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:14,480
resources and it will work everywhere

173
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,870
without the internet of course you can

174
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:23,210
also host the host the game files on

175
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:30,380
your own and implement the storage so it

176
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:32,690
will also work offline and will you will

177
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:35,450
have a full control and you will have

178
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:42,980
the option to upgrade it instantly so

179
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:46,300
let's talk about the the Firefox itself

180
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:51,020
how to start the development what to

181
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:56,090
look for first you can test your game or

182
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:58,940
application in the browser the Firefox

183
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:02,750
OS has a plug-in that works as Firefox

184
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:07,070
OS simulator and it works pretty nice

185
00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:11,270
there are great tools that will help you

186
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:15,110
in the development process and of course

187
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:19,070
you can look for a device the first ones

188
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:24,500
was the geeksphone Keong that were given

189
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:27,670
to the developers it looks like this and

190
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:34,780
it it's theoretically a quite low budget

191
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:40,150
but but the game works very smooth and

192
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:44,060
if you compare it to the phone that that

193
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:46,760
you can buy for the same money running

194
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:52,370
and Android especially if it's 2.3 it

195
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:56,630
will work with like five frames per

196
00:12:56,630 --> 00:12:57,680
second or something like

197
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:00,320
this so it's a huge difference that you

198
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:03,470
have you have direct access to the

199
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:07,220
hardware of the device and there are

200
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:09,710
more devices coming there are a new

201
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:12,470
countries that start selling that the

202
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:19,450
phones with Firefox OS yeah so the

203
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:26,209
optimization part you could just pack it

204
00:13:26,209 --> 00:13:28,850
your app put it in the missoula

205
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:32,690
marketplace and it will work so if you

206
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:36,560
don't want to optimize it you can just

207
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:40,790
leave it but it's a great improvement it

208
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:43,490
will it will work a lot faster so these

209
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:46,430
are the optimization methods that you

210
00:13:46,430 --> 00:13:54,410
can you can use in your own html5

211
00:13:54,410 --> 00:13:57,230
applications or games it's not firefox

212
00:13:57,230 --> 00:14:02,120
OS specific so it's a for example whole

213
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,560
pig surrendering when you're rendering

214
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:06,440
the the whole pixels not the parts of

215
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:11,120
the pixels and it's a huge difference so

216
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,770
if you're interested in this you can you

217
00:14:12,770 --> 00:14:16,370
can search for more information you

218
00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:18,470
could for example caused catch the

219
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:22,250
drawing on the different screen node

220
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:25,279
which is quite popular because you can

221
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:28,070
draw it on the canvas that is not

222
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:31,790
visible and it will be just shown on the

223
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:37,760
copied to the visible canvas there is

224
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:40,820
one thing that this Firefox OS specific

225
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:44,930
it's using mouse opaque on the canvas

226
00:14:44,930 --> 00:14:49,850
tag that it's I've tested it on the same

227
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:54,589
code base and it was like running 30

228
00:14:54,589 --> 00:14:57,589
frames per second compared to 60 frames

229
00:14:57,589 --> 00:15:01,220
per second so I was amazed that it's a

230
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:07,010
huge difference with only 11 tag you can

231
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:10,459
also scale the canvas using css3

232
00:15:10,459 --> 00:15:11,360
transforms

233
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,890
instead of scaling it using javascript

234
00:15:14,890 --> 00:15:18,399
there are there are ups and downs but

235
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:23,810
I've noticed that this way it's not

236
00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:27,230
perfect for every game there are games

237
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:31,820
that you have to if if the screen on

238
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:34,370
which the player is playing is different

239
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:37,700
on different devices then playing on on

240
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:42,640
different devices can give advantages to

241
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:46,190
the one player and the other player now

242
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:50,149
so so so it's important to adjust this

243
00:15:50,149 --> 00:15:53,589
to the game that you are working on but

244
00:15:53,589 --> 00:15:56,480
for most of the games it's the easiest

245
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:00,050
way to scale the canvas and just fill

246
00:16:00,050 --> 00:16:02,320
the screen and that you don't have to

247
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:09,740
worry about screen resolution another

248
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:12,940
optimization technique is using CSS for

249
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:17,329
background images if you don't have to

250
00:16:17,329 --> 00:16:20,750
if you have a big background that you

251
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:23,930
are still rendering every frame then you

252
00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:28,490
can just drop it and use the image set

253
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:31,040
as a background of of a deeper canvas

254
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:34,970
just to show it once and just it will

255
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:38,839
stay there and the rendering loop in the

256
00:16:38,839 --> 00:16:40,940
canvas will render all of the things and

257
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:43,360
the background will stay the same and

258
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:47,240
you can of course use different multiple

259
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:50,600
canvases for a different layers of your

260
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:54,920
games so you can shout the background on

261
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:57,860
the separate layer I do the UI on a

262
00:16:57,860 --> 00:17:01,160
separate and the player with with bosses

263
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:05,449
and enemies on another and there are

264
00:17:05,449 --> 00:17:07,760
great there is a great article on the

265
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:12,890
Mozilla hugs I will give the address of

266
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:14,890
the slides so we can check the article

267
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:19,669
about the optimization techniques that I

268
00:17:19,669 --> 00:17:23,360
mentioned here and so let's talk about

269
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:25,600
the Firefox marketplace a bit

270
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:32,870
it's a marketplace hello and it works as

271
00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:38,630
a place where you can put your game as I

272
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:42,590
said it's it's not you're not forced to

273
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:44,330
use only this you you you don't have to

274
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:49,370
use it at all but it's it's a great

275
00:17:49,370 --> 00:17:51,700
place to start there are not so many

276
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:56,450
games and applications so you can start

277
00:17:56,450 --> 00:18:00,530
early and outrun the competition and

278
00:18:00,530 --> 00:18:04,580
there are two types of applications for

279
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:07,190
a Firefox OS the packaged ones and the

280
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:08,659
self-hosted ones that i mentioned

281
00:18:08,659 --> 00:18:12,110
earlier the package one you you just

282
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:15,260
upload the zip package and it's

283
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:18,260
distributed and the self-hosted just you

284
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:22,280
host it on your website there is a

285
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:25,250
concept of install instant install

286
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:28,789
button that you can put on your website

287
00:18:28,789 --> 00:18:31,850
and just install the game directly you

288
00:18:31,850 --> 00:18:34,340
don't have to go to the marketplace to

289
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:36,049
install the game you don't have to

290
00:18:36,049 --> 00:18:38,330
search for it you can just put it on

291
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:40,909
your website tell your friend just click

292
00:18:40,909 --> 00:18:45,260
the button and we'll if it if he goes to

293
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:48,140
the website and from the firefox OS

294
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:49,640
clicks the button and have the game

295
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:53,659
installed and and yeah as I said it's

296
00:18:53,659 --> 00:18:57,020
almost no competition so it's a great

297
00:18:57,020 --> 00:19:02,090
time to to start early and for example

298
00:19:02,090 --> 00:19:07,010
my game is very simple it was built like

299
00:19:07,010 --> 00:19:13,549
a week or two weeks and it's it's quite

300
00:19:13,549 --> 00:19:15,890
popular in the marketplace so it's easy

301
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:19,730
to start and to to be there before

302
00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:25,370
others let's talk about preparing your

303
00:19:25,370 --> 00:19:32,539
game it's easy because it's html5 so you

304
00:19:32,539 --> 00:19:34,580
don't have to learn new technology you

305
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:38,030
don't have to learn your language the

306
00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:39,160
only thing that you need

307
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:42,880
there's a manifest file which this is

308
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:47,470
the basic version in which you see just

309
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:49,870
the name of your application description

310
00:19:49,870 --> 00:19:54,010
etc you can of course at the more

311
00:19:54,010 --> 00:19:57,310
information to the manifest but it's the

312
00:19:57,310 --> 00:20:01,150
basic one that will just work and the

313
00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:02,680
information will be provided to the

314
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:06,040
marketplace this can be shown on your

315
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:10,630
website etc and when you have your

316
00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:14,980
manifest file already and your game zip

317
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:17,770
ting the into the package you can just

318
00:20:17,770 --> 00:20:22,360
use the submit form send the file add

319
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:25,440
the description screen shots etc and

320
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:28,930
just submitted wait like two or three

321
00:20:28,930 --> 00:20:32,380
days and the game will be in the

322
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:38,920
marketplace so here's here is the

323
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,410
screenshot of the game in the

324
00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:47,020
marketplace the game itself is in

325
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:50,740
English but the description is like in

326
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:56,110
eight languages or so so if the if the

327
00:20:56,110 --> 00:21:00,520
someone enters the market place from

328
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:02,410
different country he will get the

329
00:21:02,410 --> 00:21:07,180
description in his own language mmm yeah

330
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:10,390
and the actual device I will be here you

331
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:14,530
can grab me and see the device it's the

332
00:21:14,530 --> 00:21:18,250
geeksphone key on and I can show you the

333
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:20,410
device I can show you the game it runs

334
00:21:20,410 --> 00:21:26,380
pretty smoothly okay listen lessons

335
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:29,290
learned from the making of the game for

336
00:21:29,290 --> 00:21:34,660
that platform it was it was very easy

337
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:37,870
because as I said it's just html5 and

338
00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:45,070
JavaScript so you don't have to do much

339
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:48,790
to implement

340
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:53,870
the to adapt to the the Firefox OS and

341
00:21:53,870 --> 00:21:57,840
to upload it to the marketplace the

342
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:01,800
documentation is ready if you're looking

343
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:05,130
for if something is not working you can

344
00:22:05,130 --> 00:22:08,010
google for it and get the answer most of

345
00:22:08,010 --> 00:22:10,860
the problems are not perfect so specific

346
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:15,720
so you can just look for a problem in if

347
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:18,570
you have a problem in JavaScript you can

348
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:21,270
find the answers the documentation for

349
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:24,360
the Firefox s is there so so you can use

350
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:31,050
it the the whole thing with with the

351
00:22:31,050 --> 00:22:37,050
game came from the from the event that I

352
00:22:37,050 --> 00:22:43,020
attended and it was good to see that the

353
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:47,390
the technologist is new and you have

354
00:22:47,390 --> 00:22:51,900
influence on it there was a one-day

355
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:56,400
hackathon that we managed to find like

356
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:59,370
three bucks or four bucks in the Firefox

357
00:22:59,370 --> 00:23:04,680
OS in the early version and I think two

358
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:09,690
are fixed almost immediately so so if

359
00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:13,400
you have like feature requests or ideas

360
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:17,490
or whatever you can just send the

361
00:23:17,490 --> 00:23:21,060
feedback or change something by yourself

362
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:23,370
because that the whole system is hosted

363
00:23:23,370 --> 00:23:26,850
on github and it's very easy to add

364
00:23:26,850 --> 00:23:33,000
something change something etc so to

365
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,820
summarize the the presentation and how

366
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:39,540
idea making a game for a Firefox Oasis

367
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:44,760
is very easy it's very easy to build and

368
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:47,100
very easy to publish in the marketplace

369
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:50,130
just the manifest file just a few

370
00:23:50,130 --> 00:23:54,930
optimizations and it works perfectly you

371
00:23:54,930 --> 00:23:58,050
have the device to which you have access

372
00:23:58,050 --> 00:24:01,530
to from the JavaScript

373
00:24:01,530 --> 00:24:05,860
for me it's awesome and you're building

374
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:08,170
not for the Firefox OS but you're

375
00:24:08,170 --> 00:24:12,310
building for the web because the the

376
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:15,970
Firefox OS itself is a web app built in

377
00:24:15,970 --> 00:24:19,270
html5 and JavaScript so the applications

378
00:24:19,270 --> 00:24:21,160
and the games also are just web web

379
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:26,890
applications just html5 games so you can

380
00:24:26,890 --> 00:24:30,240
just put it on your website it will work

381
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:34,900
and there will be a conference in or so

382
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:41,530
in like a week about html5 games and if

383
00:24:41,530 --> 00:24:44,740
