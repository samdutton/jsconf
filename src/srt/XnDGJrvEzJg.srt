[Music]

2
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:19,920
that's me I wrote a blog starter block

3
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,430
back in 2014 and I didn't really know I

4
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:25,800
was thinking about other than I wanted

5
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,400
to write about front-end development

6
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:32,489
today I helped over 40,000 developers a

7
00:00:32,489 --> 00:00:34,710
month with their front-end related

8
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:38,040
questions I never thought that my

9
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:39,960
smaller block would be able to help so

10
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:43,110
many people so writing this blog and

11
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:47,039
helping people is an honor for me I also

12
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:48,629
didn't think that I would be able to

13
00:00:48,629 --> 00:00:51,329
write books or courses but I did so

14
00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:52,079
anyway

15
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:56,190
in 2015 I launched my first book that's

16
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:59,789
called learning Suzie in 2016 I launched

17
00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:02,359
my second book automating a workflow in

18
00:01:02,359 --> 00:01:05,400
2017 my first course mastering

19
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,710
responsive typography and just two weeks

20
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:10,560
ago I launched the latest one learn

21
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:16,229
JavaScript in 2018 I never would have

22
00:01:16,229 --> 00:01:19,500
gotten so far without writing writing

23
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,380
has taught me a lot about communication

24
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:27,600
about talking to people about creating

25
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,820
relationships and even about selling the

26
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:32,820
things that I make and today I'd like to

27
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:35,100
share with you three things that I've

28
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:37,259
learned through the process of writing I

29
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:39,090
believe that these three things are

30
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:43,140
important for all of us so three lessons

31
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:47,640
here's the first one silence the inner

32
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:51,509
critic we all have a critic at the back

33
00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:52,200
of our hitch

34
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,000
it's the voice that tells us not to

35
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,590
write the blog post that we wanted to

36
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:57,420
write it's the voice that tells us not

37
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:59,280
to contribute to open source because we

38
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,040
are not good enough it is the voice that

39
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,570
tells you not to ask your boss for a

40
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:05,219
raise because you're going to get fired

41
00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:07,259
instead of getting the race that you

42
00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:10,500
want and that's the voice that tells me

43
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,959
not to stand on stage today to share

44
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:14,040
with you about writing

45
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,810
because I'm gonna embarrass myself in

46
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:24,780
front of 400 people this voice goes by

47
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:28,560
many names Steven Pressfield calls it

48
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,769
the resistance Seth Godin calls it the

49
00:02:31,769 --> 00:02:34,109
lizard brain some of us will know it as

50
00:02:34,109 --> 00:02:36,209
the imposter syndrome I'm just gonna

51
00:02:36,209 --> 00:02:39,750
call it the critic today the thing about

52
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:42,480
the critic is whenever you want to do

53
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,150
something important it will be there to

54
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:48,959
stop you it will say nasty things in

55
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:51,720
your face it will try to make you lose

56
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,549
confidence and you will probably lose

57
00:02:53,549 --> 00:02:57,540
confidence along the way it will and the

58
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:00,329
sucky part about this all is that the

59
00:03:00,329 --> 00:03:03,810
more important something is to you the

60
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:05,669
more you care about the results that you

61
00:03:05,669 --> 00:03:10,310
want to make the louder the critic gets

62
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:12,780
many people think that the critic will

63
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:15,200
go away when you become more experienced

64
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:19,049
unfortunately it doesn't the critic gets

65
00:03:19,049 --> 00:03:21,150
louder as you become more experienced

66
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:23,629
because you're playing at bigger stakes

67
00:03:23,629 --> 00:03:26,699
sir Sweden who is a front-end developer

68
00:03:26,699 --> 00:03:29,010
there respect a lot still here security

69
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:32,310
and I'm sure that the speakers that have

70
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:34,500
gone before me have experienced the

71
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,239
critic and the speaker's they will go

72
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:39,060
after me will also experience the critic

73
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:45,510
as well so to overcome the critic your

74
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:48,900
honor consider a question what is more

75
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:50,639
important is what you are doing more

76
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:52,709
important or is the critic more

77
00:03:52,709 --> 00:03:55,470
important if what you are doing is more

78
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:57,689
important than the critic are you

79
00:03:57,689 --> 00:04:00,109
willing to pull it above the critic if

80
00:04:00,109 --> 00:04:06,720
you are then start doing the work start

81
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,030
talking to people start designing start

82
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:10,500
making the thing that you want to make

83
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,629
no matter whether it's for profit or for

84
00:04:12,629 --> 00:04:15,060
fun it doesn't matter just start doing

85
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:19,859
it do it over and over and over again

86
00:04:19,859 --> 00:04:21,900
and you'll learn to tell the critic that

87
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:24,900
hey it's okay leave it to me

88
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:27,000
trust me to handle things and if it all

89
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:27,730
goes to

90
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:31,470
 the world probably wouldn't end I

91
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:33,790
the world probably wouldn't end I
will probably be able to handle things

92
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:38,710
and it's fine we leave the CNR they so

93
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:41,710
do the work do it because it's important

94
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:44,020
to you and do it because it's important

95
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:49,150
to all of us second lesson it's about

96
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:52,750
them there are many ways to take in this

97
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:57,040
lesson so here's a few here's the first

98
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,460
way the work that you put into whatever

99
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:03,730
you want to do it's about them not you

100
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:07,750
not anyone else if you want a raise from

101
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:09,520
your boss then you kind of have to think

102
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,710
about your boss it's not about you

103
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:14,050
anymore if you want better relationship

104
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:16,390
with your family members it's about your

105
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:19,570
family members not about you if you want

106
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:21,250
to write a blog post and you want it to

107
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:24,550
be good you think about the readers who

108
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:26,560
are reading your blog posts not about

109
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,670
you not about anyone else if you put the

110
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:35,110
focus on the work on them you release

111
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:36,760
the focus on yourself and when you

112
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:39,640
release the focus on yourself there your

113
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:42,370
critic weakens yes

114
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:44,230
the kriti will still tell you that you

115
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:47,470
are lousy and what she teach what she

116
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:49,420
teaches you got yourself into like what

117
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:50,790
am i doing over here

118
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:52,990
and it will tell you how unfair the

119
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:55,620
world is but it doesn't matter anymore

120
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:58,390
because what's important is about them

121
00:05:58,390 --> 00:05:59,860
it's about the people you're trying to

122
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,450
help it's about the people who will read

123
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:05,530
your work not anyone else so let's say

124
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:08,320
you put a critic aside and you manage to

125
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:11,530
put on some work what's the most scary

126
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:14,590
thing that's going to happen for all of

127
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:15,130
us

128
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:16,570
the most scary thing that's going to

129
00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:19,360
happen is that people will ignore you

130
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:25,090
and that is going to happen nobody will

131
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:28,420
see your work nobody will notice your

132
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:33,990
existence and that is going to happen

133
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:36,430
and here's the second way to think about

134
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:41,350
this lesson because people are busy

135
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:44,470
their lives people don't care about you

136
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:46,300
they don't care about your work they

137
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:48,760
don't care about what you do all they

138
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:51,250
care about is themselves and the things

139
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:53,680
they want to care about so just think

140
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,670
about it this way

141
00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:56,560
you don't care about a person who is

142
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,090
sitting two seats away in front of you

143
00:06:58,090 --> 00:07:02,350
in this conference don't you not unless

144
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:07,060
you know them personally so don't worry

145
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:09,570
about what others think of your work and

146
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:12,070
don't worry if others don't pay

147
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:14,220
attention to what you are trying to say

148
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:18,610
because if you focus on helping them if

149
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:21,640
you focus on them sooner or later they

150
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:25,210
will notice you and when they do notice

151
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:27,550
you some of them will thank you for the

152
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:29,860
work that you do some of them will

153
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:32,500
encourage you to write more to do more

154
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:36,570
and some of them will on you and

155
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:41,080
that comes to the third lesson you

156
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:43,630
further face haters gonna hate if they

157
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:46,930
hate your work that is fine because it's

158
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:50,230
not about you it's about them what they

159
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:52,150
are doing is underneath the who if you

160
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:54,640
think about it think about a person you

161
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:58,240
hate or you dislike why do you dislike

162
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,070
this person or why do you hate this

163
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:02,710
person if you dive deep into the

164
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:04,450
question you're going to come with an

165
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:06,610
answer that feels somewhat similar to

166
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:06,970
this

167
00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:10,570
I hate or dislike this person because of

168
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:12,610
a personal experience that I hate about

169
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:17,140
this situation so that is what haters is

170
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:19,030
actually doing they are not hating your

171
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:22,630
work they are not hating you they are

172
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:24,900
hating and experience that they have

173
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:28,450
about someone else or about themselves

174
00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:31,630
so don't let your protec smash you for

175
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:33,849
something that is not your fault

176
00:08:33,849 --> 00:08:36,430
don't let your critic smash you for a

177
00:08:36,430 --> 00:08:39,880
problem that belongs to someone else go

178
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:42,219
in there put in the work because it is

179
00:08:42,219 --> 00:08:47,050
important for all of us now is one I

180
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:51,730
have to say that sometimes reasonable

181
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:55,080
people say hateful things to enjoy

182
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:59,520
fifteen I wrote my first guest post for

183
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:02,580
Smashing Magazine and you guys probably

184
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:04,560
know what Smashing Magus if not you

185
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,120
wouldn't be here so I will it shouldn't

186
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:09,900
explain in 2015 I wrote my first post I

187
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:12,600
put it everything I got to make it the

188
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:15,840
best post I have ever written so far the

189
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:18,480
more the morning the guest post got

190
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,000
released I checked my Twitter feed and I

191
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,440
saw this I felt confused and bizarre

192
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,450
that this article was published in the

193
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:29,640
prestigious website like Smashing

194
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:33,810
Magazine and mind you this is a from a

195
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:37,380
hater this was from expert that I

196
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:46,410
respected it hurts it took me a while to

197
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:49,590
get over it emotionally and you can see

198
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:53,910
that it's still hurting me right now but

199
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:56,100
bear in mind that whatever the expert

200
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:59,340
said about you is his or her opinion as

201
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:03,000
well whatever the experts say doesn't

202
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,400
mean that your work is it doesn't

203
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,860
mean that your work is not valid because

204
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:09,630
if you focus on the people you are

205
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:12,870
trying to help and the people get it

206
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:15,030
then it's all worth it I know the

207
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:16,740
article was good because people came

208
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:20,070
back and thank me for it so remember

209
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:26,430
it's all about them not about you not

210
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:31,370
about the experts not anyone else and

211
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:33,900
with that let me come to my third lesson

212
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:39,690
and that is be human as humans we have a

213
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:43,740
gift we have the ability to put

214
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:45,870
ourselves in someone else's shoes we can

215
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:49,380
empathize with people but we don't use

216
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:52,110
it many of us don't I'm pretty sure the

217
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:54,150
expert who wrote the tweet didn't care

218
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:56,400
about my feelings as someone was trying

219
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,650
to contribute back to the community I'm

220
00:10:58,650 --> 00:11:01,560
pretty sure he didn't he or she didn't I

221
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:11,570
can't forget he or she

222
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:15,310
but why why don't we empathize different

223
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:20,770
people more one reason maybe because we

224
00:11:20,770 --> 00:11:22,600
are so absorbed in our own worlds that

225
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:25,570
we completely forgot that anyone else

226
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:29,170
exists and we don't care about them at

227
00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:35,440
all and as I said another reason might

228
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:39,220
be because we are brought up that way we

229
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:41,170
are brought up to treat people how you

230
00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:44,980
want others to treat you and to us that

231
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:48,700
is respect but there's a fatal flaw in

232
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:52,570
this statement because it assumes that

233
00:11:52,570 --> 00:11:55,930
you and I are the same it assumes that

234
00:11:55,930 --> 00:11:58,180
you and I like the same things

235
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:02,770
yep but I am NOT you and you are not me

236
00:12:02,770 --> 00:12:06,030
we like and dislike different things I

237
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:09,190
don't want to be treated like you I want

238
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:11,770
to be treated like me and that applies

239
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:14,470
to all of us in this room and everyone

240
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:17,920
else in the world so instead of treating

241
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,650
people how you want them to treat you I

242
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:24,700
say you treat them how they need you to

243
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:29,920
treat them need not want because

244
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,510
sometimes you need to treat people

245
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:34,510
harshly for their own sake for example

246
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:37,120
if your kids are naughty sometimes you

247
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,970
have to spoil them you one like that

248
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:42,850
they won't like that but you need to do

249
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:47,890
it for their sake but how do you treat

250
00:12:47,890 --> 00:12:50,440
people how do how do you know how to

251
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,690
treat people and how better duner need

252
00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:56,920
them or not and for that you need to put

253
00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:00,220
yourself in their shoes you need to

254
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:02,860
figure out what they are feeling before

255
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:07,290
you can find out but empathy is

256
00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:10,930
difficult it is tempting to say come

257
00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:14,700
into the room and say that I know oh

258
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:17,290
it's an it's tempting to come into the

259
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:17,670
room

260
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:21,240
say that I know exactly what you are

261
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:23,580
feeling so that's why you should do this

262
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:26,790
and follow my instructions that is

263
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:28,980
 my friend that is

264
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:31,590
my friend that is
because there is no way that you won't

265
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:33,240
know how I feeling because you are not

266
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:35,460
me and you have not gone through my

267
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:38,100
experiences so you don't know that

268
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:40,350
magnitude of my fears of my anxieties of

269
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:43,470
my worries and of my pain there is no

270
00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:47,910
way but if you are willing to you can

271
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:51,300
come close and if you are being real

272
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:52,020
about it

273
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:54,300
you can make a connection in that moment

274
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,790
and when you make a connection in that

275
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:59,820
moment that is when we open up people

276
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:02,520
open up we open up because we know you

277
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,980
understand us and we know you care and

278
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:08,760
we trust you we trust your words this is

279
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,980
the golden moment where everything

280
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:14,250
methods because what you say even though

281
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:16,440
if you don't know it what you say will

282
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,150
stay in their hearts for a long long

283
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:22,290
time to come and if they don't act on

284
00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:24,720
what you say if they don't act on your

285
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:28,050
advice that is fine because what snakes

286
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:31,250
is up to them you have done your work

287
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:35,910
what snakes is about them and with that

288
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:38,430
I would like to wrap up the top for

289
00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:41,930
today I believe that these three lessons

290
00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:45,420
silence a critique is about them not you

291
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:48,960
and being human are three lessons that

292
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,670
are very important for all of us over

293
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:54,330
here why let's imagine for a moment if

294
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:57,690
all of us in this room and I mean just

295
00:14:57,690 --> 00:15:00,270
all of us in this room only not anyone

296
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:02,700
else who is outside watching the stream

297
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:05,640
not anyone else who is at home reading

298
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:08,910
watching the live stream if all of us in

299
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:11,970
this room follow these three lessons if

300
00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:14,790
we all put aside our critics if we all

301
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:17,490
focus on the people we want to help if

302
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:21,290
we encourage and help each other and

303
00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:23,880
understand each other and the people we

304
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:27,780
want to help what can we build in 10

305
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:31,139
years what kind of war will really

306
00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:37,559
in ten years now imagine if everyone in

307
00:15:37,559 --> 00:15:41,190
the world does the same thank you
