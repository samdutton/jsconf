1
00:00:10,629 --> 00:00:12,530

so I'm a software too

2
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:15,090
/ but i took a rather unusual path to

3
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:17,280
to code I taught myself out of code by

4
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:20,850
making 180 websites and 180 days so I

5
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:22,410
grew up on the east coast of the United

6
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:25,290
States in a suburb of Philadelphia where

7
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:28,170
my family has lived for over 250 years

8
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:31,430
as farmers and small business owners and

9
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:33,660
while there was a lot of Duty yourself

10
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:35,670
spirit in my community there wasn't a

11
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:37,940
lot in the way of art and technology and

12
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:40,290
growing up I didn't have any role models

13
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:43,530
for what a software engineer even was so

14
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:44,879
when I went to college I ended up

15
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:47,640
studying fine art in part because it had

16
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,399
absolutely nothing to do with farming

17
00:00:49,399 --> 00:00:51,899
but also because I was really passionate

18
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:55,410
about making things so while I was there

19
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:58,500
I ended up going to an art museum with a

20
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,149
friend and we were wandering the halls

21
00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:01,620
we got down to the basement

22
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:03,690
we turned around a corner and we were

23
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:05,729
confronted with this an amazing

24
00:01:05,729 --> 00:01:08,729
sculpture it's wrong you expand and this

25
00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:10,110
the sculpture is incredible

26
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:12,690
it's a 7-foot tall hyper-realistic

27
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:16,500
sculpture of a very large dude and it's

28
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:18,360
absolutely breathtaking as soon as my

29
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:19,950
friend and I stepped into the space we

30
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:21,600
immediately dropped our voices down to a

31
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,270
whisper it was that powerful and I

32
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:26,090
remember thinking to myself how

33
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:28,500
unfathomable it was that this thing even

34
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:31,170
existed I mean the sheer size of this

35
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:31,530
thing

36
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:34,679
the weight the cost and especially the

37
00:01:34,679 --> 00:01:37,500
amount of skill an artist would need to

38
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,899
build something so complicated and so

39
00:01:39,899 --> 00:01:42,270
detailed and so beautiful it was an

40
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:43,649
experience I took with me all the way

41
00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:49,050
through grad school so after grad school

42
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:51,840
I felt like there was this explosion of

43
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,090
Technology happening all around me we

44
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:55,530
have all these amazing products that are

45
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:58,289
getting made from open-source projects

46
00:01:58,289 --> 00:02:00,330
like docker we have new communication

47
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:02,310
platforms like Twitter wearables

48
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:04,560
Internet of Things all these amazing

49
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,319
things and I realized I wasn't satisfied

50
00:02:07,319 --> 00:02:10,170
with just using these products I wanted

51
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:11,190
to get out there and actually be able to

52
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:15,120
build them I wanted to learn to code now

53
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,590
when a lot of people think about what it

54
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:18,510
takes to learn how to code they think

55
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:20,069
I'll I have to go to some special course

56
00:02:20,069 --> 00:02:22,319
and I need to take special classes and

57
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:24,180
get certification for certification and

58
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:26,250
then then I'll finally be able to make

59
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:27,710
some web apps or something

60
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:29,810
but along with this explosion and

61
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:31,880
technology has been an explosion in

62
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:34,670
information and so all the knowledge you

63
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:35,870
need is actually already out there

64
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:39,530
online and most of its free so as long

65
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:40,850
as you have a project that you want to

66
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:43,100
work on and the motivation to do it you

67
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:44,450
already have all the tools that you need

68
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:47,960
to be able to learn and grow and I love

69
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:50,540
working on self-directed projects so I

70
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:52,310
knew when I wanted to learn to code that

71
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:54,890
going through a bootcamp or an online

72
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:56,950
course just wasn't going to work for me

73
00:02:56,950 --> 00:02:59,870
so when I started thinking about what a

74
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:01,310
good self-directed project would look

75
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:03,980
like I came up with a few guidelines for

76
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:10,250
myself so first I wanted to start small

77
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:13,190
I knew that I had never done any coding

78
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:14,990
before and so I wanted to take these

79
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:17,150
large coding concepts and condense them

80
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:19,370
down into something manageable something

81
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:22,700
I could tackle as a beginner - I wanted

82
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:24,680
to code something I could see I wanted

83
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,390
to what I was working on to result in

84
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:28,640
something tangible and so that I could

85
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,430
play with it and explore and then three

86
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:34,840
is I knew in order to develop the

87
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:37,010
interactive dynamic web apps I was

88
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:38,630
ultimately interested in making I would

89
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:43,430
need to develop for the full stack so

90
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:44,750
that left me with a couple of different

91
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:47,240
ideas for how to approach this first I

92
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,550
thought okay well why don't I take a few

93
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:51,560
small websites and just start there and

94
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,210
then eventually jump on to something

95
00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:55,400
bigger and this was appealing in a lot

96
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,560
of ways because you know I didn't know

97
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:58,910
what I was doing so this would allow me

98
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:00,560
to get comfortable with tools for

99
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,780
building websites and also how websites

100
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:04,910
were even built but then I was left with

101
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:06,020
the nagging question of how many of

102
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:08,210
these websites would I need to make

103
00:04:08,210 --> 00:04:09,410
before I moved on to something bigger

104
00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:12,050
and would I ever actually feel like

105
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:14,750
moving on to something bigger so I said

106
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:16,880
okay what if I just jump right in tackle

107
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,850
one big app and this is appealing to to

108
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:21,320
me in a lot of ways because it would get

109
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,760
me right to what I was ultimately

110
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:25,580
interested in doing and a lot of people

111
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:27,260
have gone down that path themselves and

112
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:29,960
been very successful but as a beginner

113
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,490
this seems like a really large mountain

114
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:34,040
of knowledge to try to climb so that

115
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,780
left me about 1/3 crazy option which was

116
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:38,870
build 180 websites in 180 days and it

117
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:40,669
turned out this was great for me it was

118
00:04:40,669 --> 00:04:41,330
in

119
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:42,949
hence immersive learning environment

120
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:45,020
that allowed me to explore any and all

121
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:46,580
ideas that I found interesting along the

122
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:49,039
way and and gave me plenty of room for

123
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:52,250
productive failure so I said all three

124
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:55,849
rules for myself first I would build one

125
00:04:55,849 --> 00:05:00,500
website one website a day excuse me

126
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:03,259
one website a day every single day 480

127
00:05:03,259 --> 00:05:06,379
days each website would be accompanied

128
00:05:06,379 --> 00:05:09,259
by a blog post and three all of the code

129
00:05:09,259 --> 00:05:11,000
that I wrote would be public publicly

130
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,520
published on github and so throughout

131
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,110
the project I was able to do a whole

132
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:16,940
bunch of different things I was able to

133
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:21,020
learn HTML CSS JavaScript Ruby on Rails

134
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:24,289
even a little bit of nodejs I was able

135
00:05:24,289 --> 00:05:28,789
to make toys games tools data

136
00:05:28,789 --> 00:05:30,110
visualizations even real-time

137
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:32,270
communication apps and by the end I was

138
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:34,039
able to build the dynamic interactive

139
00:05:34,039 --> 00:05:39,229
web apps I'd originally set out to do so

140
00:05:39,229 --> 00:05:40,639
on April 1st 2013

141
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:42,620
I made the very first website for the

142
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:45,050
project and that's the homepage now this

143
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:46,729
is just a couple of lines of HTML and

144
00:05:46,729 --> 00:05:49,009
CSS and it took me all freaking day to

145
00:05:49,009 --> 00:05:52,849
do so it's not much but it was a start

146
00:05:52,849 --> 00:05:56,479
and so by day three I was ready to get

147
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:57,740
into some interactive JavaScript

148
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:59,539
awesomeness this is random color

149
00:05:59,539 --> 00:06:01,310
background and as you can see you click

150
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:03,259
the button up the top you get a random

151
00:06:03,259 --> 00:06:05,240
color background so it's a really simple

152
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,129
concept but I was super excited about

153
00:06:07,129 --> 00:06:08,930
this because it was the first time I'd

154
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:10,759
made something that people could

155
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:15,110
actually interact with and change and

156
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:16,940
now that I had the power of JavaScript

157
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:18,560
as an arbitrary coding language I was

158
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,120
able to go out and explore a whole array

159
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:23,089
of coding concepts so object-oriented

160
00:06:23,089 --> 00:06:24,680
programming came pretty quickly for me

161
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:27,080
this is dropping boxes this is from Dave

162
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:30,860
15 and here you can see I'm already

163
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:32,509
starting to think about these objects on

164
00:06:32,509 --> 00:06:34,819
the screen as little individual beings

165
00:06:34,819 --> 00:06:38,029
and so you click on them they get a CSS

166
00:06:38,029 --> 00:06:40,219
animation that I coded up and I really

167
00:06:40,219 --> 00:06:41,870
like this one just because the the boxes

168
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:43,039
all seem to take on their own little

169
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:45,680
individual personalities and this would

170
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,210
also mark the start of something of a

171
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:49,190
CSS obsession of mine at the beginning

172
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:52,610
of the project and so this is silly

173
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:54,860
kitty and this is the ultimate Express

174
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:57,050
of that CSS obsession so this is all

175
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:59,090
done with CSS there's no images on the

176
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:01,639
screen there's just a couple of

177
00:07:01,639 --> 00:07:04,280
JavaScript handlers and it's 656 lines

178
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:10,550
of CSS yeah so I was super proud of it

179
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:13,189
really excited by it but I also realized

180
00:07:13,189 --> 00:07:14,270
that maybe I should start thinking about

181
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:18,680
using proper JavaScript objects and so a

182
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,150
few days later I made little dude this

183
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:22,939
is from day 36 and he's this little

184
00:07:22,939 --> 00:07:25,099
Tamagotchi guy you can feed him you can

185
00:07:25,099 --> 00:07:26,900
hug him you can play with him and like

186
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:28,629
all good Tamagotchis you can kill him

187
00:07:28,629 --> 00:07:32,479
and he still depends really heavily on

188
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:36,680
CSS particularly for how he looks but he

189
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,300
is a proper JavaScript object as

190
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:42,529
maintaining his own state and so here we

191
00:07:42,529 --> 00:07:45,379
have picnic from day 126 and so this is

192
00:07:45,379 --> 00:07:46,849
at this point I've got a good handle on

193
00:07:46,849 --> 00:07:48,469
JavaScript objects all of these little

194
00:07:48,469 --> 00:07:49,610
bugs on the screen are their own

195
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:50,870
individual objects and they're all

196
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:52,969
managing their own state on the system

197
00:07:52,969 --> 00:07:54,680
and you can see that they're they're

198
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,599
interacting both with the mouse to try

199
00:07:56,599 --> 00:07:58,389
the cursor to try Boyd getting squished

200
00:07:58,389 --> 00:08:00,680
then they're also interacting with each

201
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,120
other and actually transferring energy

202
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,770
as they bump into each other across the

203
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:08,719
blanket and I got into physics for a

204
00:08:08,719 --> 00:08:10,819
while so once I started working with

205
00:08:10,819 --> 00:08:12,110
JavaScript objects I naturally

206
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:14,270
gravitated toward the html5 canvas

207
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:16,339
element and this is one of the things I

208
00:08:16,339 --> 00:08:17,479
did during the project that I wouldn't

209
00:08:17,479 --> 00:08:18,830
have necessarily done going through a

210
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:21,259
bootcamp or an online course but it was

211
00:08:21,259 --> 00:08:22,639
actually really incredible because it

212
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:24,529
gave me the opportunity to use

213
00:08:24,529 --> 00:08:27,110
JavaScript as an arbitrary coding

214
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:28,610
language and actually explore coding

215
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:32,349
Kandra coding concepts using javascript

216
00:08:32,349 --> 00:08:35,719
so this is from Dave 55 it's called

217
00:08:35,719 --> 00:08:37,310
paratroopers it's a little game where

218
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:39,199
the object is to land your paratroopers

219
00:08:39,199 --> 00:08:40,849
on that island so that they can take a

220
00:08:40,849 --> 00:08:44,870
vacation and I had not done any physics

221
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:46,730
to speak of since high school when I

222
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:48,380
started this project so getting those

223
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:50,360
little dudes to jump out of that plane

224
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,800
and fall through the air in a realistic

225
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,959
way was a pretty complicated task for me

226
00:08:53,959 --> 00:08:54,980
it took me a while to figure out the

227
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:56,779
formulas and equations to get it to work

228
00:08:56,779 --> 00:08:58,850
so I was really happy by the end of the

229
00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:01,399
day that I was able to make it happen so

230
00:09:01,399 --> 00:09:06,780
the next day I took a little breather

231
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:11,360
okay it's supposed to say hooray and

232
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,490
came back right back the next day with

233
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:14,990
bug blaster so this is a little cannon

234
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:16,160
game where we have these bugs up in the

235
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,930
sky and you're supposed to hit him with

236
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:19,580
this cannon and you can adjust the

237
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:22,250
parameters so this was also another

238
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:23,870
difficult physics problem for me to

239
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:26,000
tackle and it took a long time for me to

240
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,440
actually get the cannon to work

241
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,840
correctly so I didn't get to add as much

242
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,550
design as I wanted to but then a friend

243
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:33,200
mentioned that I've gone from basically

244
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,200
from 0 to 2d kinematics in two days so I

245
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:39,880
felt a little bit better about that and

246
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:42,800
this is blinky this is from day 123 and

247
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,050
this is based off of my favorite prices

248
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:47,750
right games link go and you can see you

249
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:49,190
drop a disc and it has to bounce off

250
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:51,200
these little pins and you're supposed to

251
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,990
get it into the green area and I had set

252
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:56,390
out on the day to make this unbelievably

253
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:58,850
awesome game and it was incredibly

254
00:09:58,850 --> 00:10:00,500
difficult for me to actually get that

255
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:01,820
ball to bounce off of those pins

256
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:04,580
correctly so it ended up taking to the

257
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:05,900
wee hours of morning just to get it this

258
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:07,490
far so I was pretty bummed because I had

259
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:10,130
set out to do something a lot more with

260
00:10:10,130 --> 00:10:12,080
this and didn't get as far as I wanted

261
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:15,470
to so I felt like kind of a failure but

262
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:17,870
in reality there were a number of

263
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:20,290
failure days throughout the project

264
00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:22,730
so the first failure day comes from day

265
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:25,190
8 this is more drop shadow and I had

266
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:28,850
this vague concept of you could give

267
00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:30,650
users an ability to kind of play with

268
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:33,290
the drop shadow design element and I

269
00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:35,690
don't know but what ended up happening

270
00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:37,940
is I started the day and I made a mock

271
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:40,010
and it made another mock-up I made

272
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:41,510
another markup and before I knew it it

273
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:43,400
was 8 o'clock at night I had nothing on

274
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,380
the screen and it was totally panicking

275
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:47,510
so I just quit grabbed whatever mark I

276
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:49,160
could find and this is what I came up

277
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:52,160
with and I was totally totally bummed

278
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,890
out about this because I hadn't executed

279
00:10:54,890 --> 00:10:56,720
on my vision it's already day 8 and I'm

280
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,090
failing hard and like what is this crap

281
00:10:59,090 --> 00:11:00,500
who might how am I gonna show this to

282
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:05,870
somebody and in reality I as much as I

283
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:08,000
was upset I didn't I hadn't failed right

284
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,290
I had never set out in my rules that

285
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:11,090
every website had to be great or even

286
00:11:11,090 --> 00:11:14,540
good or mediocre and in fact the failure

287
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:17,450
days often came with really valuable and

288
00:11:17,450 --> 00:11:19,019
interesting

289
00:11:19,019 --> 00:11:21,339
so this is the San Francisco hipster

290
00:11:21,339 --> 00:11:24,639
quiz and it's just a basic form and it

291
00:11:24,639 --> 00:11:26,199
was super easy for me to get that up and

292
00:11:26,199 --> 00:11:29,320
running but it turns out writing content

293
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,910
is incredibly difficult

294
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:33,250
in fact so difficult that it took me

295
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:35,050
eight hours just to write the content

296
00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:39,759
for this dumb quiz and some failures are

297
00:11:39,759 --> 00:11:41,410
kind of I can be kind of proud of this

298
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:43,240
is Swivl this is from day one ninety

299
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:45,579
three and it's I had this idea for a

300
00:11:45,579 --> 00:11:48,130
game where you had these wedges and then

301
00:11:48,130 --> 00:11:49,990
when the when you clicked on one it

302
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:52,000
would turn and then when the edge of a

303
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,589
wedge lined up with the edge of another

304
00:11:53,589 --> 00:11:55,149
wedge then that wedge would turn it

305
00:11:55,149 --> 00:11:56,680
would set off this crazy chain reaction

306
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:59,019
and there would be points and strategies

307
00:11:59,019 --> 00:12:01,509
and and bells and whistles and all this

308
00:12:01,509 --> 00:12:03,610
fancy stuff around it and it turns out

309
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:06,190
you might be surprised that is kind of

310
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:08,050
hard and tricky to get that system

311
00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:10,750
actually working correctly so took me

312
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:12,430
several several tries over the course of

313
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:13,660
the day and at the end of the day I

314
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:15,339
didn't get to add in any of the gameplay

315
00:12:15,339 --> 00:12:17,170
that I wanted so in that sense it was

316
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:19,360
kind of a failure but I still think it's

317
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,709
really cool that I got the system to

318
00:12:20,709 --> 00:12:22,870
work and in fact it's kind of fun to

319
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:24,399
watch the system go from this chaotic

320
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:29,380
state into a lot of order and sometimes

321
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:32,319
failures can be really amazing and

322
00:12:32,319 --> 00:12:34,899
interesting so I this is fireworks this

323
00:12:34,899 --> 00:12:38,139
is from day 58 and I set out with the

324
00:12:38,139 --> 00:12:39,970
day and I said okay I've got three main

325
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:41,529
goals that I need to hit one I got to

326
00:12:41,529 --> 00:12:44,380
get that rocket to go up in the air - I

327
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:46,269
got to get the particles to explode out

328
00:12:46,269 --> 00:12:48,430
and fall down the screen and then three

329
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:51,160
I got a style it make it so that those

330
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:52,959
particles kind of fade out randomly and

331
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:54,760
that the fireworks at the top are bigger

332
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:55,959
and basically just make it look like

333
00:12:55,959 --> 00:12:58,600
fireworks so I started with step one

334
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,370
that was great I got this step two that

335
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:02,110
looked good and then I figured okay I

336
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:03,610
better you know I've got all these

337
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:05,110
particles falling off the screen and I

338
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:06,819
better you know clean them up out of the

339
00:13:06,819 --> 00:13:08,920
array so I don't end up with a memory

340
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:10,569
leak blowing up my browser so I went

341
00:13:10,569 --> 00:13:12,100
into did that real quick and then I came

342
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:14,279
back just to check on things and

343
00:13:14,279 --> 00:13:16,959
everything was perfect it looked amazing

344
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:20,040
I had a beautiful randomly fading out

345
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:22,540
particles there was like even like these

346
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:24,160
trailers that were really cool I was

347
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,860
like I have no idea what's going on here

348
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:29,170
but you know what it ship it I'm

349
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:30,670
good to go I get a couple extra hours of

350
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:31,200
sleep

351
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,420
and it wasn't until later that night

352
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:35,850
that I was started thinking about it and

353
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:37,889
you know how you're not supposed to

354
00:13:37,889 --> 00:13:39,889
delete items from array in place

355
00:13:39,889 --> 00:13:42,209
turns out the visual representation of

356
00:13:42,209 --> 00:13:47,190
that as fireworks and so I didn't lose

357
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:49,860
my artistic side during the project my

358
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:52,100
family was keeping along with me and

359
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:54,360
especially in the early days I didn't

360
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,820
have Attili make a website that didn't

361
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:58,320
have quite enough direction about what

362
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,149
you were supposed to do and my family

363
00:14:00,149 --> 00:14:02,459
would very helpfully send me an email

364
00:14:02,459 --> 00:14:04,139
telling me my website was broken for the

365
00:14:04,139 --> 00:14:05,730
day because they were too afraid to

366
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:06,810
actually click somewhere and break

367
00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:08,579
something so that's where the idea for

368
00:14:08,579 --> 00:14:13,560
snare came from and this is TOS this is

369
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:15,449
the Terms of Service for Jennifer Dewalt

370
00:14:15,449 --> 00:14:18,480
comm and it was it's actually been

371
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,100
adapted from automatics Terms of Service

372
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:21,899
for WordPress which is released under a

373
00:14:21,899 --> 00:14:25,220
creative commons share-alike license and

374
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:27,540
this is electro bounce I love this one

375
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:30,089
this is from day one 96 and so we have

376
00:14:30,089 --> 00:14:31,470
these nodes on the screen and they're

377
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:32,970
bouncing around and when they get close

378
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:34,740
to each other aligned forms between them

379
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:35,820
and as they move away the line

380
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:37,740
dissipates and you can change all these

381
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:41,070
parameters from the speed the distance

382
00:14:41,070 --> 00:14:43,110
the color the width all these different

383
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:45,720
things and I love how you get so many

384
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:48,360
different moods and emotions and

385
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:50,610
feelings from this app so I'd love to

386
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:52,079
see this one installed in like a party

387
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:53,339
or something where people can come up

388
00:14:53,339 --> 00:14:55,050
and play with it and change the way it

389
00:14:55,050 --> 00:14:57,630
looks based on how the feeling of the

390
00:14:57,630 --> 00:15:02,070
room is and it made a bunch of tools

391
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:03,990
during the project as well so this is

392
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:05,880
email impact and this the point of this

393
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,560
is to keep your help you keep your

394
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:09,480
emails concise because nobody likes

395
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,940
really long drawn-out boring emails and

396
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:14,850
so here as you type in words the font

397
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:16,529
actually contracts and gets smaller so

398
00:15:16,529 --> 00:15:18,390
the more content you put in the harder

399
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:24,240
it is to read and this is trees for the

400
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,579
forest so this is a big favorite of mine

401
00:15:26,579 --> 00:15:30,089
so this is from day 117 and I mentioned

402
00:15:30,089 --> 00:15:31,860
that I got really into physics for a

403
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:33,930
while I also started thinking about how

404
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:36,089
things like how code reflects reality

405
00:15:36,089 --> 00:15:39,029
and how math is related to code and

406
00:15:39,029 --> 00:15:40,709
nature and all these crazy geeky things

407
00:15:40,709 --> 00:15:43,319
and I've came to fractals I start

408
00:15:43,319 --> 00:15:44,420
thinking about fractals and I remember

409
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:46,670
that as a kid when I learned to draw

410
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:49,220
trees I learned by drawing these crazy

411
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:52,370
fractal patterns so here for trees for

412
00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:53,480
the forest you can actually click on the

413
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:55,490
screen and they grow these beautiful

414
00:15:55,490 --> 00:15:57,980
fractal trees and add colorful leads to

415
00:15:57,980 --> 00:15:59,060
them and when you have your whole scene

416
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:00,709
ready and beautiful you can actually

417
00:16:00,709 --> 00:16:03,730
download it to save it for later and

418
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:06,740
then this is color work so this is a

419
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:08,180
tool that I actually needed in the

420
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:10,910
project so I built it every day I was

421
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:12,019
creating a new color palette and I

422
00:16:12,019 --> 00:16:14,350
needed to very rapidly build up the

423
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:17,149
shades and the and the end of textures

424
00:16:17,149 --> 00:16:20,000
and thing and colors for for what I was

425
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,500
working on that day for buttons and

426
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,360
headers and shadows and all that stuff

427
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,639
so I came up with this because I needed

428
00:16:25,639 --> 00:16:28,730
to very quickly play with the saturation

429
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:31,399
and the lightness and darkness of colors

430
00:16:31,399 --> 00:16:34,550
and this is this doesn't have I still

431
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:36,740
use actually whenever I'm whenever I'm

432
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:38,089
working on a new color palette I go to

433
00:16:38,089 --> 00:16:40,730
this one and color became an interesting

434
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:43,639
theme throughout the whole project and I

435
00:16:43,639 --> 00:16:45,680
I've always been interested in color but

436
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:46,880
I'm not it's not something I've ever

437
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,350
worked with extensively before this

438
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:51,800
project I as an artist I started out and

439
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,180
working with black and white photography

440
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:55,490
I tend to wear a lot of black but I

441
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:57,380
think the reason it became so important

442
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:59,300
is because color is one of the more

443
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:01,699
important tools we have as developers

444
00:17:01,699 --> 00:17:05,929
for conveying our meaning and so I made

445
00:17:05,929 --> 00:17:08,179
a bunch of games too this is Simon and

446
00:17:08,179 --> 00:17:10,490
Simon was a really popular game back

447
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:12,020
when I was a kid and it was super cool

448
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:13,370
because it was all like electronic and

449
00:17:13,370 --> 00:17:15,740
beeping noises so now I can play it

450
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:19,220
whenever I want and here's a chess

451
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:21,110
sketch this is also from kind of my

452
00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:23,689
crazy CSS mind days this is all done

453
00:17:23,689 --> 00:17:27,110
with CSS and I have memories of fighting

454
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:28,220
with my sister in the backseat of our

455
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:30,500
car over who's a sketch was better but

456
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:31,850
it turns out that even though I have a

457
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:33,290
background in art I've never been a very

458
00:17:33,290 --> 00:17:34,720
good at chess sketch artist

459
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,520
and this is snake this is a really

460
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,840
interesting game it actually dates back

461
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:41,720
to the late 70s but didn't become

462
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:44,620
popular until the late 90s when Nokia

463
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:46,880
released a cell phone that had this game

464
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:49,040
pre-loaded on it which if anybody

465
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,540
remembers the late 90s that was like a

466
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:55,250
really big freaking deal and so after

467
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:57,080
making a few real-world games I decided

468
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:58,220
to try my hand at

469
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:00,769
making one of my own so this is alien

470
00:18:00,769 --> 00:18:02,899
attack and this this is a game based off

471
00:18:02,899 --> 00:18:07,610
of Atari games my dad had this old Atari

472
00:18:07,610 --> 00:18:08,990
gaming system but I love playing with

473
00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:10,100
them because the games even though the

474
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:11,960
graphics were really basic the gameplay

475
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,370
was really easy to get started with and

476
00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:16,100
really hard to master so this is a based

477
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:19,309
off of one of those games and then when

478
00:18:19,309 --> 00:18:20,960
I started using rails I started thinking

479
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,919
about how to connect people together I

480
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:26,600
finally had the ability to allow people

481
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:29,960
to leave like a signature or some sort

482
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,820
of mark that showed other people that

483
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:33,139
they had been there so I came up with

484
00:18:33,139 --> 00:18:34,879
quick counter and as you can see the

485
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:36,620
buttons been clicked over three hundred

486
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:39,620
thousand times and then a few days later

487
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:41,149
I decided to see what little dude was up

488
00:18:41,149 --> 00:18:43,100
to so this is make a dude and here you

489
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:44,539
can make your own little dude and give

490
00:18:44,539 --> 00:18:47,539
him a name a message a color and when

491
00:18:47,539 --> 00:18:49,129
he's all styled up you can submit him

492
00:18:49,129 --> 00:18:51,769
and he will join the army of little

493
00:18:51,769 --> 00:18:54,379
dudes on the homepage and when I say

494
00:18:54,379 --> 00:18:57,470
army I mean army they're over 16,000

495
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:58,519
little dudes that have been made and

496
00:18:58,519 --> 00:19:02,750
Counting and here we have the tiny notes

497
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:05,509
this is from day 80 this is totally not

498
00:19:05,509 --> 00:19:09,379
a rebuff of a famous social network so

499
00:19:09,379 --> 00:19:10,850
you enter in your message on the left

500
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:12,470
hand side and then it goes into the feet

501
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:15,860
on the right and of course most of the

502
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:17,629
notes that were made are just kind of

503
00:19:17,629 --> 00:19:19,429
garbage going spitting out to the ethers

504
00:19:19,429 --> 00:19:22,460
the internet likes to do but a lot of

505
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:23,480
people took the opportunity to actually

506
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:25,370
say something very specific to me with

507
00:19:25,370 --> 00:19:28,970
the app and I got really into data so

508
00:19:28,970 --> 00:19:32,889
this is weather now so you enter in your

509
00:19:32,889 --> 00:19:35,929
city and it queries the world whether

510
00:19:35,929 --> 00:19:38,809
online API and returns the current

511
00:19:38,809 --> 00:19:42,169
weather displayed really simply and here

512
00:19:42,169 --> 00:19:43,490
we have elevations this is a favorite of

513
00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:45,350
mine too so you enter into cities here

514
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:47,029
we've got San Francisco and New York and

515
00:19:47,029 --> 00:19:50,059
we go in and this queries the Google

516
00:19:50,059 --> 00:19:52,879
Places API and gets the elevations

517
00:19:52,879 --> 00:19:54,409
between the two places and then displays

518
00:19:54,409 --> 00:19:55,820
it on the screen so you get a visual

519
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:57,649
representation of the terrain actually

520
00:19:57,649 --> 00:20:01,000
between these two these two cities and

521
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,769
this is de 165 and I'm really hitting my

522
00:20:03,769 --> 00:20:05,840
stride here this is this is I'm pulling

523
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,159
together all sorts of different concepts

524
00:20:07,159 --> 00:20:08,659
that I've been working on everything

525
00:20:08,659 --> 00:20:09,970
from physics to

526
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:13,450
down to data visualization even

527
00:20:13,450 --> 00:20:15,490
shareability and so the way this works

528
00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:18,250
is we've got different notes on the

529
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:20,520
screen those are the colored dots and

530
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,720
you can move them around you can add as

531
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,250
many as you want and then from the

532
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:26,650
center we have these pulses that are

533
00:20:26,650 --> 00:20:28,720
coming out and you can add more of those

534
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:29,260
as well

535
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:31,990
and as the pulses move out they pass by

536
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:33,640
the notes and they pluck them and they

537
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:36,010
flash and so you can add all these

538
00:20:36,010 --> 00:20:37,750
different things get them all styled up

539
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:39,430
and the thing I really love about this

540
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:43,780
app is that the more visual beauty you

541
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:45,280
put into the system the more audio

542
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:47,110
discord goes into it so it's a really

543
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:58,430
interesting contrast between the two

544
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:02,770
okay real fast close it up so at the end

545
00:21:02,770 --> 00:21:04,600
of project I started using node.js which

546
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:07,480
gave me access to real-time data so here

547
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:08,680
we've got a bunch of hashtags on the

548
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,540
screen these are listening to the

549
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:13,210
Twitter streaming API and as those as

550
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:15,700
those hashtags come in they flash on the

551
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:17,080
screen and they get tallied up into a

552
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:18,520
positivity rating so you can see how

553
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:22,000
happy twitter is right now and from day

554
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,440
one seventy nine this is all drawl and

555
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,840
it's a collaborative drawing up and so

556
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,160
here you can join with your friends and

557
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:30,100
you can you can sketch together you can

558
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:31,420
draw messages you can mess up each

559
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:34,120
other's stuff whatever and the thing

560
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:36,070
that's always fundamentally fascinated

561
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:38,260
me about the Internet is its ability to

562
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:40,750
connect us in a way that we can share

563
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:44,530
ideas and and information in basically

564
00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:46,270
real-time and I think all draw early

565
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:50,110
encapsulates that feeling for me so

566
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:52,030
those are 40 of my websites and along

567
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:54,100
with the other 140 that I made is how I

568
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:55,840
taught myself to code by making 180
