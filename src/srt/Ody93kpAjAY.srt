everything that we do here tonight is

8
00:01:39,729 --> 00:01:44,140
done with JavaScript so I know right so

9
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:45,880
before we start actually giving you a

10
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,979
show we thought what we'd do is just

11
00:01:47,979 --> 00:01:50,200
take you through very briefly every

12
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,810
single aspect of what you just saw so

13
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:54,850
grab a tray I assume you got drinks

14
00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:57,130
outside at some war that's fine relax

15
00:01:57,130 --> 00:02:02,020
and enjoy the show and I'm supposed to

16
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:06,759
be starting my fix of the screen get up

17
00:02:06,759 --> 00:02:10,479
sweet it's gonna be fun right so yeah as

18
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:13,600
you may have gathered I make music and I

19
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:18,580
use computers to do that however it's I

20
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:22,360
can hide there I haven't even drank

21
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:26,980
anything it anyway okay all right sorry

22
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:29,319
I just we yeah we good we good ok all

23
00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:34,240
right so I got sick of making music with

24
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:36,280
computers and I decided to make software

25
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,740
to make music with computers and I did

26
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:41,020
it with JavaScript because javascript is

27
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:43,060
the thing I know but I know what you're

28
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:46,959
thinking today I'm going to show you a

29
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:49,510
super simple turkey recipe that gives

30
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:51,099
you the most perfect delicious bird

31
00:02:51,099 --> 00:02:53,739
every time we'll start by tossing out

32
00:02:53,739 --> 00:02:56,070
the giblets

33
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:58,240
but we'll keep the Nick will be using

34
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:00,940
that now for the stuffing will need 1

35
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:03,730
cup of celery 1 cup of carrots and X and

36
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:27,010
a dog

37
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:31,190
why would you do that why on earth what

38
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:33,560
anyway I have a very good reason

39
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:36,750
basically playing computer music is

40
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:39,950
really weird it's it's a strange thing

41
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:45,270
so most of my life the last 10 years no

42
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:46,980
not most my life almost the last 10

43
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:48,630
years i have been using computers to

44
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:52,370
make music in my bedroom and going from

45
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:56,850
composing stuff in a timeline to

46
00:03:56,850 --> 00:03:58,620
actually trying to play a gig in front

47
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:00,720
of people it's something that every I

48
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,000
think pretty much anyone that's doing

49
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,070
modern music these days faces but

50
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:06,090
particularly people that are doing

51
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:08,010
entirely computer-based music with

52
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:08,940
they're not actually playing any

53
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:10,320
instruments themselves they're just

54
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:12,209
putting little dots on the screen and

55
00:04:12,209 --> 00:04:14,010
they're tweaking parameters and it's

56
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:15,870
just it's just really strange for us to

57
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:18,570
try and play live and compared to

58
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:22,590
someone like a guitarist because what

59
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:23,610
they're doing on the album is really

60
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:25,320
similar to what they're doing on stage

61
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:27,240
they just playing the guitar and so if

62
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,440
they're on stage they play the guitar

63
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:30,090
people are like woohoo if they're on the

64
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:32,100
album then the recording engineers like

65
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:34,110
do that again but otherwise it's pretty

66
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:37,770
much the same so what are my options as

67
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:41,130
a musician if I want as a computer

68
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:42,990
musician if I want to actually play my

69
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:45,270
stuff for real to an audience well one

70
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:46,950
of them is I could just get some real

71
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:48,360
musicians to play everything for me and

72
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,950
I could be like the conductor or

73
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:52,650
something and there are a lot of really

74
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:54,060
cool electronic bands that do that so on

75
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,560
the album it's just like one guy doing

76
00:04:55,560 --> 00:05:00,210
everything or one gal but in the stage

77
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:02,490
they start getting some guy on the drums

78
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:04,590
and someone else on the guitar and some

79
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:05,910
of the sense and someone on the crazy

80
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:08,060
stuff and it's kind of cool but I think

81
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:10,110
you kind of get a different complete

82
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:11,310
different vibe from that and some of

83
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:13,110
this kind of better I mean why do we

84
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:14,220
even doing computer music which is just

85
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:17,250
play real instruments but the next

86
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:20,100
option of course is you can DJ it and

87
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:24,000
this is more like exhibited as a musical

88
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,330
artist so rather than

89
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:30,389
just rather than trying to like recreate

90
00:05:30,389 --> 00:05:31,739
everything on stage it's like you know a

91
00:05:31,739 --> 00:05:33,899
painter isn't going to paint something

92
00:05:33,899 --> 00:05:37,289
every gallery it's they painted this

93
00:05:37,289 --> 00:05:39,300
thing in the beautiful little mentioned

94
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:40,979
somewhere up and he'll and then they've

95
00:05:40,979 --> 00:05:42,599
shifted all this stuff into a beautiful

96
00:05:42,599 --> 00:05:44,099
space that you can come view their

97
00:05:44,099 --> 00:05:46,889
painting and so I think DJ's are kind of

98
00:05:46,889 --> 00:05:49,319
doing that and this is my favorite

99
00:05:49,319 --> 00:05:54,300
example to welcome this gentleman to the

100
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:59,309
stage please give it up for darude so

101
00:05:59,309 --> 00:06:01,499
everyone is so hot to see this amazing

102
00:06:01,499 --> 00:06:04,800
musician perform have paid thousands of

103
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:09,319
dollars and learn miles or kilometers

104
00:06:09,319 --> 00:06:12,779
and here he comes is so cool this is

105
00:06:12,779 --> 00:06:16,159
darude darude is like the most amazing

106
00:06:16,159 --> 00:06:22,529
electronic artist of all time he's

107
00:06:22,529 --> 00:06:30,149
coming up on stage and what does he do

108
00:06:30,149 --> 00:06:34,829
are you ready for it he pushes play and

109
00:06:34,829 --> 00:06:37,199
the rest of this is just him going

110
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:40,319
height and lots of light show so Madden

111
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:50,080
has a really useful role for the river

112
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:54,080
but that is not what I wanted to do for

113
00:06:54,080 --> 00:07:00,139
vyas reasons maybe to some people so

114
00:07:00,139 --> 00:07:02,520
really I was only one their option which

115
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:03,720
is I actually have to play everything

116
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:07,830
myself and I have and well I mean I'm

117
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:09,270
not really going to show you the music

118
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:11,009
that I've been that I used to make

119
00:07:11,009 --> 00:07:12,960
because it's completely changed since I

120
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,150
started trying to play everything myself

121
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:20,940
but yeah it's if you want to find out

122
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:23,130
about that story you should look at my

123
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:24,630
talk I gave last year jazz conf there

124
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:27,840
was anyone here at last JS conf yeah

125
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,539
cool some people yeah you should look it

126
00:07:30,539 --> 00:07:31,770
up because i'm going to explain what I

127
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:33,000
makes you doing so what I'm going to do

128
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,550
now is I'm just going to show you what

129
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:42,599
my JavaScript software does so oops I

130
00:07:42,599 --> 00:07:44,699
haven't get my web camera working and we

131
00:07:44,699 --> 00:07:46,349
able to OB have yeah can you get a

132
00:07:46,349 --> 00:07:51,810
close-up of my hands sweet so I can just

133
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:55,220
play sounds

134
00:07:55,230 --> 00:08:06,580
instruments I can also play perfectly in

135
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:16,640
time with the beat

136
00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:19,000
and then i can look whatever I've just

137
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:40,720
done and I can just build up whole songs

138
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:43,240
doing those things and so all of these

139
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:45,370
different colors represent different

140
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:46,780
sounds that I can trigger at any moment

141
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:48,730
that I want to and I can have as many

142
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:52,360
different things loaded and I can mix

143
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,860
between them kinda like it has somewhere

144
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:56,980
between a DJ and a musician yeah so

145
00:08:56,980 --> 00:09:00,130
that's pretty much how this all works so

146
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:01,960
I'm going to be doing this for another

147
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:04,210
hour after this but without talking it's

148
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:07,840
gonna be much better thank you very much

149
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:10,420
Matt so what you're saying is you make

150
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:12,700
music with JavaScript I do that's

151
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:16,420
amazing cuz I need music really yeah I'm

152
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:19,360
the VJ right you what now well it's a VJ

153
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,090
I know I get this question a lot so I

154
00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:24,910
put visuals to music that's what a VJ is

155
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:27,490
I might need a llama in a minute so how

156
00:09:27,490 --> 00:09:31,270
out of the audience waiting for that to

157
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:33,520
be ready yeah okay good who remembers

158
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:39,450
this we're now it really whips the law

159
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:48,400
haha the best internet in heaven and

160
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:53,050
Eminem I honestly I'm taking that DJ

161
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:56,320
everywhere with me from now on no best

162
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,170
mp3 player of all time right for those

163
00:09:59,170 --> 00:10:00,550
of you don't know it's a really really

164
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:02,200
light mp3 player for when we actually

165
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:05,830
kept mp3s on hard drives but this wasn't

166
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:07,630
the best thing about winner this lovely

167
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:09,580
piece of software no no the best thing

168
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:12,580
about winamp was this the visualization

169
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:15,010
engine he remembers that so this was

170
00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:16,450
actually a part of the software so you

171
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:18,190
could fire this up and it would show you

172
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:20,440
visualizations that went in time with

173
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,660
the music this is probably the biggest

174
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:25,660
influence of any VJ of my generation we

175
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:26,980
used to sit there in our teenage years

176
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:28,360
and just watch it

177
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,620
like I wouldn't be caught if we could

178
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:32,589
make this ha funnily enough we can in a

179
00:10:32,589 --> 00:10:35,860
browser okay so the first thing you need

180
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:38,260
to create visuals in browsers to analyze

181
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:40,540
the sound so we can do that with the Web

182
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:42,370
Audio API it has an analyzer node that's

183
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:43,930
really cool so this is just a quick

184
00:10:43,930 --> 00:10:46,959
example of what we can do this is mostly

185
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:49,269
sort of analyzing my voice now it's a

186
00:10:49,269 --> 00:10:50,769
little bit of latency cuz I'm running it

187
00:10:50,769 --> 00:10:53,290
within the slides so we just grabbed the

188
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:55,800
analyzer node from the Web Audio API and

189
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:58,630
all we're doing or we get back is an

190
00:10:58,630 --> 00:11:00,430
array of frequency velocities all right

191
00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:02,200
so frequencies that's low sounds too

192
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,329
high sounds and all it's doing is

193
00:11:04,329 --> 00:11:06,579
telling us what volume those frequencies

194
00:11:06,579 --> 00:11:09,220
are any given time so we can take that

195
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:10,990
data and it's just numbers we can just

196
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:13,149
take that data and do whatever we want

197
00:11:13,149 --> 00:11:14,350
with it and we can do that when they're

198
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:16,060
browser so you can use a whole bunch of

199
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:18,130
sort of browser features so we can do

200
00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:19,540
stuff on the Dom we can do stuff on

201
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:21,459
canvas we can we can do stuff with WebGL

202
00:11:21,459 --> 00:11:23,230
we can do whatever we want we can use

203
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:26,589
new features so one of the visuals do so

204
00:11:26,589 --> 00:11:28,600
at the beginning uses CSS blends and

205
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,730
filters which is nice these lovely

206
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:32,740
speakers here you saw some of them

207
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:35,380
earlier that's all blend modes that was

208
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:37,209
fun building that it's a little bit it's

209
00:11:37,209 --> 00:11:38,680
a little bit cranky unerring a bit it

210
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:41,140
was fun building it other things like

211
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:45,100
custom properties right so this is a fun

212
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:47,230
one this is JavaScript all up in your

213
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:49,690
CSS so what you can do is you can take

214
00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:52,810
one of the frequency values pass it into

215
00:11:52,810 --> 00:11:54,519
a custom property which is basically a

216
00:11:54,519 --> 00:11:57,040
CSS variable and pass it back into your

217
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:00,310
CSS right so we can do that here we're

218
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:02,019
using the get byte frequency data so a

219
00:12:02,019 --> 00:12:03,640
frequency data here is our frequency

220
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,500
data array and then we're just doing

221
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,720
document.documentelement style step

222
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:10,060
property and then the level there that's

223
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:13,000
my CSS variable and I'm just passing

224
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,130
that data back into my CSS so i can

225
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:17,860
change anything in the browser CSS wise

226
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:19,720
with that frequency data so i can not

227
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:21,100
only can I do it in my JavaScript I can

228
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:24,730
do my CSS as well that's fun so it's

229
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:26,170
pretty it's pretty easy to make visuals

230
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:27,850
I'm sure we can all code right if you

231
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:29,230
want to see more of my visuals I've been

232
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:31,060
doing code member this month so if you

233
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:33,100
go on code pen and look me up and see a

234
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:34,630
whole bunch of experiments I've been

235
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:35,620
doing I've been trying to do them in

236
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:36,790
different ways as well whether that's

237
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:39,430
normal Dom elements like looping over

238
00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:40,440
sort of il

239
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,540
and changing sizes which is the spectrum

240
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:44,670
you saw earlier or trying new things out

241
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:46,680
like using d3.js that's a really really

242
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,960
nice library to use for taking the data

243
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,430
and manipulating it and doing things

244
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:55,080
with it but how do we control it web

245
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:58,020
MIDI API right so when my favorite

246
00:12:58,020 --> 00:12:59,790
things to talk about you say midi to

247
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:01,530
somebody and everybody just assumes it's

248
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:03,840
bleep e electronic music i am going to

249
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,820
i'm going to break your brains it is not

250
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:09,300
even sound midi is a data protocol it

251
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:10,860
came about in the 80s and a bunch of

252
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:12,600
industry experts and music manufactures

253
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,220
got together and they said we've got all

254
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:15,720
these amazing electronic instruments

255
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:16,860
these days and they've got no way to

256
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:18,390
talk to each other and they weren't

257
00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:20,970
let's make let's make a protocol so they

258
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:23,220
did we are all running midi controllers

259
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:25,110
here all three of us only one of them is

260
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:27,480
being used to make sounds like he's

261
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,950
using went to control lights with which

262
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:31,980
is pretty brilliant this this is a

263
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:33,690
million a word instrument so this has

264
00:13:33,690 --> 00:13:36,810
onboard audio right we pretty much steam

265
00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:38,340
run of these this is a keyboard you play

266
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:40,440
it play sounds it also sends MIDI data

267
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,300
so you can plug this into your computer

268
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:46,500
and it will send MIDI data this this is

269
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,840
a controller this is what we're using so

270
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,010
it does the same thing it sends midi

271
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:51,480
data but it doesn't have any onboard

272
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,610
audio so you can just plug into a laptop

273
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:55,140
you run the web MIDI API you're

274
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:58,620
basically getting numbers so this is my

275
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:00,720
midi controller I've got a little one

276
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,250
they've got big once it's my handbag

277
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:06,090
midi controller oh and if we get the

278
00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:07,410
camera over here so you can see what

279
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:09,780
would undoing can i point it that way

280
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:12,240
what should happen i say this happens is

281
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,880
when I crossfade using the bottom slider

282
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,520
here it will fade from one visual into

283
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:18,810
the other visual there's a tiny bit of

284
00:14:18,810 --> 00:14:21,510
latency but yeah we're going from the

285
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:24,150
love the opening for JSA de into the

286
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:26,610
speakers and back again and all I'm

287
00:14:26,610 --> 00:14:28,470
doing is just picking up on the numbers

288
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:30,240
and making sure that happens we make it

289
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,960
go back again there you go thank you so

290
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,910
MIDI is a great data protocol and it

291
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:38,100
actually influenced other things like a

292
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:41,280
lighting protocol which is DMX which I

293
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:46,710
believe Martin is using I am actually

294
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:51,880
so just a bit of background information

295
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,890
if you so there's this protocol called

296
00:14:53,890 --> 00:14:56,680
DMX which is basically used by any sort

297
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,450
of professional lighting equipment but

298
00:14:58,450 --> 00:15:01,930
if you ever have a look at how these

299
00:15:01,930 --> 00:15:04,420
lights are normally operate their huge

300
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:07,960
custom-made computers that are terribly

301
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:11,010
expensive I couldn't afford one so I

302
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:15,010
look like mmm I can build something like

303
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:18,040
that myself so this is one of the two

304
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:21,130
medium two phases notnot media DMX DMX

305
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:23,500
interface is that I'm using to control

306
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:27,010
all the lights here in this venue um so

307
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:31,630
how DMX works as a pretty simple so DMX

308
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:36,720
has 512 channels hence the name DMX 512

309
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:40,020
and all each of these channels is

310
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:44,230
basically just one byte number and in

311
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:47,050
DMX there's always only one sender and

312
00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:51,150
all the other devices are receivers

313
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:54,820
there's something I call device mapping

314
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:57,100
happening which means that every device

315
00:15:57,100 --> 00:16:00,220
needs to know which of these 512

316
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:03,810
channels it should read from a stream of

317
00:16:03,810 --> 00:16:08,710
512 bytes so I define a start address

318
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:10,810
for each device which is the first

319
00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:13,420
address agreed and then the menu says

320
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:15,760
for instance or device will read like

321
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:19,360
four channels for different functions or

322
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,790
maybe just one channel if it's just a

323
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:24,910
lamp that I can doom or switch on and

324
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:27,580
off or something like that but the most

325
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:29,530
annoying thing about DMX is how its

326
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:31,480
implemented because every manufacturer

327
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:34,060
does completely different things with it

328
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:36,880
so that they're sometimes you can

329
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:39,220
control the color with 16-bit well I use

330
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:41,830
using two channels sometimes just ate

331
00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:44,860
but were you so it's kind of horrible to

332
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:48,030
just manipulate the spider race manually

333
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:52,870
however we look at something like this

334
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:55,780
this is basically DMX translated to

335
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:58,270
JavaScript so I have a unsigned int

336
00:16:58,270 --> 00:16:58,860
array

337
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:03,870
512 bytes and this device data would be

338
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:05,880
a slice of that array that the device

339
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:09,680
sees in this case starting at address 42

340
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:13,590
obviously and gather the array index

341
00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:16,020
zero bias dmx addresses are always one

342
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:19,740
based and so for instance some device

343
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:21,120
mapping could look like those that I

344
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:22,800
have one channel the control to

345
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:25,290
brightness and three channels and

346
00:17:25,290 --> 00:17:30,840
control a color value but however most

347
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:33,450
devices especially adult that way i have

348
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:37,010
here i'm not that simple so the

349
00:17:37,010 --> 00:17:39,630
spotlights we have here in the venue

350
00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:43,500
have like 20 stepper motors and all

351
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:46,260
sorts of really complex stuff going on

352
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:49,140
so they are moving hat spotlights like

353
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:51,510
you see in a picture so you can control

354
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:53,310
with pan until you can control the

355
00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:56,100
motion then there's the brightness and

356
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:57,900
the color value the caliber you is not

357
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:01,250
RGB but it is an see my color mixing

358
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:04,980
then we have configurable lenses so I

359
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:08,430
can move both lenses back and forth so I

360
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:10,620
can have half parameters like zoom and

361
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:12,840
focus and then there are special beam

362
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:15,930
shaping effects and a lot of more stuff

363
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:19,740
so in total verse 27 channels for each

364
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:23,670
of these devices in order to manage that

365
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:27,210
I wrote this library called 512 and I

366
00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:29,220
did that for last year's jazz comfy you

367
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:32,160
where I was first presented which is

368
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,680
basically just a really neat abstraction

369
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:39,960
library for this dmx512 protocol coat

370
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:43,620
looks like this so I have DMX device the

371
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:46,350
first parameter as an address the second

372
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:47,790
parameter is a list of all the

373
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:50,460
parameters that device accepts I left

374
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:52,710
them out because it's usually really

375
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:58,200
really long list and yeah once I have

376
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,240
those device I can just assign values to

377
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,450
a property is so which is quite amazing

378
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:06,090
what define property year allows me to

379
00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:10,590
do there there are also things automatic

380
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:12,750
version from degrees to the internal

381
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:15,710
system of the Miller moving heads or

382
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:18,630
even every CSS Calla values

383
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:20,640
automatically translated into see my

384
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:27,659
color format so um I wanted to do some

385
00:19:27,659 --> 00:19:29,940
light show with it so the simplest way

386
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:32,640
would be so I I have some sort of

387
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:36,000
integral function and yeah I can I can

388
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,960
just use something like trigonal

389
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:43,850
trigonometric functions I had those were

390
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:46,770
just to control the motion and and that

391
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:50,539
works give me a smooth motion but

392
00:19:50,539 --> 00:19:53,130
controlling this was something like

393
00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:54,990
these mini midi controllers here and

394
00:19:54,990 --> 00:19:58,190
constantly switching and not knowing how

395
00:19:58,190 --> 00:20:00,570
exactly the lights are layout and when

396
00:20:00,570 --> 00:20:02,700
you I would have magic numbers

397
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:04,649
everywhere so I decided to go a

398
00:20:04,649 --> 00:20:07,860
different route and Reeve real bad cold

399
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:12,809
so it look like this so um you might you

400
00:20:12,809 --> 00:20:15,720
might notice what I did there I still

401
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,850
the same properties but it's just CSS

402
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:21,120
syntax which is really very much easier

403
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:26,279
to ride um but yeah how could that even

404
00:20:26,279 --> 00:20:31,500
work so the first thing i did was i have

405
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:34,740
some HTML so I have something that I can

406
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:37,500
style which looks like this so I have

407
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:40,200
devices I have the device route and no

408
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:43,020
browser of a dentist it's just chrome

409
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:45,899
didn't complain about there being some

410
00:20:45,899 --> 00:20:48,149
unknown texts I could still style them

411
00:20:48,149 --> 00:20:50,820
as I liked so I have these channel

412
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:53,820
numbers so one coulomb is the business

413
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:55,950
interface number so which of these two

414
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:58,799
interfaces will handle this title the

415
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:02,070
second one the channel number and then I

416
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:04,320
have some classes and stuff that i can

417
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:07,799
use when writing that CSS and then there

418
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:11,100
is a little bit of JavaScript so i can

419
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:13,649
just very all these device notes from

420
00:21:13,649 --> 00:21:16,770
from the document and then I can use get

421
00:21:16,770 --> 00:21:19,649
computed style doing this repeatedly in

422
00:21:19,649 --> 00:21:21,450
an animation loop so i can always get

423
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:22,210
the

424
00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:25,360
current value of all my custom

425
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:28,780
properties that I just made up and then

426
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:31,150
I just need to decode what is in the

427
00:21:31,150 --> 00:21:34,750
style so from string to number

428
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:37,630
conversion stuff like that and write it

429
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:42,970
out using the dmx interfaces but there's

430
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:46,360
one problem with that because if I just

431
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:50,170
write pan colon zero degrees the browser

432
00:21:50,170 --> 00:21:51,940
will just say and now that's invalid

433
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:53,950
seus as I don't have that in computed

434
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:57,160
style so I had to do a little trick

435
00:21:57,160 --> 00:22:00,490
which is using custom properties so

436
00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:03,040
color is something the browser knows and

437
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:04,840
animation is something the browser knows

438
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:06,550
but everything else just gets the plug

439
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:08,590
custom property so i can read out the

440
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:12,670
values but i don't know if you've been

441
00:22:12,670 --> 00:22:15,930
here yesterday's talk by Leah veeru

442
00:22:15,930 --> 00:22:18,700
custom properties and animations don't

443
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:21,370
mix so there's a proposal for that and I

444
00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:23,580
would have hoped i have a working

445
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:25,840
implementation of that now here but

446
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:28,480
didn't show up so I needed a hack for

447
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:33,610
that this is this one so I figured I can

448
00:22:33,610 --> 00:22:35,560
just use any animatable feels as

449
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:39,040
property and just instead of writing pan

450
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:40,750
I can right left and instead of right

451
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:43,570
until I write lat riot and instead of

452
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:46,120
brightness I could write top or all

453
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:49,420
these margins or all these border radius

454
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:51,550
and any any animatable sees as property

455
00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:53,800
would work for this so i have a huge

456
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:56,860
repository of properties that i could

457
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:58,960
animate instead of my own custom

458
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:02,380
properties so the heck is this I pass

459
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:06,280
all those years SI right and then modify

460
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:09,340
the AST so i can add these custom

461
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:13,090
properties and animation for bags then

462
00:23:13,090 --> 00:23:15,940
finally reassemble it into a CSS source

463
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:18,460
code and inject it into the browser and

464
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:21,970
finally in this animation group that are

465
00:23:21,970 --> 00:23:24,160
shown that i've shown you get computed

466
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,720
style will always give me the current

467
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:31,660
value of all those animations and to

468
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:32,770
prove this

469
00:23:32,770 --> 00:23:35,950
this is um the code that has been

470
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:39,340
running all the time so we have for

471
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:44,140
instance as a whole lot of CSS that I

472
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:48,220
wrote last day but um so I have these

473
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:50,770
abbreviations like you p for the quantum

474
00:23:50,770 --> 00:23:54,850
profile and AQW for the quantum wash

475
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:58,900
light and i can now just go ahead and be

476
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:08,460
like nah QW and let's say brightness 1

477
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:14,840
this will be full brightness all right

478
00:24:14,850 --> 00:24:20,490
and it gets even brighter now this app

479
00:24:20,490 --> 00:24:24,400
III know I no no no problem is i'm

480
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:32,650
missing it's been in pin being overrun

481
00:24:32,650 --> 00:24:36,720
by and here i can also show you that

482
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:40,240
this is actually happening right in my

483
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,940
browser so here's this device root and i

484
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:47,860
can now just look at this here and so

485
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:50,590
which one stage floor stage fours

486
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:56,220
interesting let's look at this one ah so

487
00:24:56,220 --> 00:25:00,070
come up and here you see all these

488
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:03,790
others generators style so i have this

489
00:25:03,790 --> 00:25:06,520
color white here which is now over

490
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:11,260
written somewhere here and i believe i

491
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:14,850
should be able open those aren't on okay

492
00:25:14,850 --> 00:25:19,650
so i can also just go ahead and write

493
00:25:19,650 --> 00:25:25,600
directly until my dev tools additional

494
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,490
CSS for all these sir for all these

495
00:25:27,490 --> 00:25:34,090
devices anyway so it's about to reload

496
00:25:34,090 --> 00:25:41,130
um and now stuck here

497
00:25:41,130 --> 00:25:46,560
okay this bed oh that's great yeah I

498
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:52,950
guess wow the little what I what I will

499
00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:55,560
be presenting with for the for the next

500
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:59,340
hours and the final thing what I need to

501
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:02,250
know tell you is this thing will do

502
00:26:02,250 --> 00:26:05,340
nothing out and toggling CSS classes on

503
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:09,420
that devices element on the top so if i

504
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:13,170
just press these buttons you see devices

505
00:26:13,170 --> 00:26:16,230
updates the style and animations start

506
00:26:16,230 --> 00:26:21,630
and stop and move and so on right was my

507
00:26:21,630 --> 00:26:24,690
part roof that's amazing it if you

508
00:26:24,690 --> 00:26:26,550
haven't discovered midi controllers is

509
00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:28,230
hardware enabling your browser you

510
00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:30,720
really need to do that you press buttons

511
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:35,070
things change it's amazing would you

512
00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:38,630
like to help us make a song make a track

513
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:44,870
yeah yeah okay great let's do that

514
00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:48,900
alright so i have a audio recorder here

515
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:51,150
in my hand and you guys have voices and

516
00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:53,580
you have feet and you have hands and you

517
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:55,020
can whack all those things together

518
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:56,640
we'll see what happens not each other

519
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:02,550
though okay and just adjust that we will

520
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:04,820
hear can I just get everyone to yell out

521
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:08,010
javascript on the count of three one two

522
00:27:08,010 --> 00:27:22,100
three just words yeah I think it worked

523
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:27,220
that's good enough that was just the

524
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:31,960
warmup what is with it okay okay um can

525
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:35,020
I get everyone to on the count of three

526
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:38,140
to stomp their foot I know it sounds

527
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:39,760
unusual but it makes a very good

528
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:45,340
standing kick drum hang on okay one two

529
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:59,200
three it's all right we can we can make

530
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:10,150
it better though it's all right okay can

531
00:28:10,150 --> 00:28:11,920
I get everyone to on the count of three

532
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:28,120
to clap one two three that's right ok

533
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:29,890
now let's do some let's make out this

534
00:28:29,890 --> 00:28:31,900
make some melody here anyone got a

535
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:37,000
beautiful singing voice or just a voice

536
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:41,680
is good enough voices so I'm creating a

537
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:43,450
new chunk which I'm going to drop on my

538
00:28:43,450 --> 00:28:46,450
launch pad as you can see on the screen

539
00:28:46,450 --> 00:28:50,590
there these here they curl correspond to

540
00:28:50,590 --> 00:28:53,200
my actual hardware so I'm just saying on

541
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,420
this particular pair XY coordinates i

542
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:57,580
want this particular sound and so now

543
00:28:57,580 --> 00:29:00,880
i'm going to record something into it

544
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,650
whoops so i'll just show you what it's

545
00:29:02,650 --> 00:29:05,360
