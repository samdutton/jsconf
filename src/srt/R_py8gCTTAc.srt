00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,509

yeah hi how is everyone CSS I look yes

3
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:10,170
way too comfortable you need like

4
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:12,870
plastic chairs we were send out on

5
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:14,790
belief that's what's happening thanks

6
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:15,780
everyone for coming out today

excited to be here this is the first

10
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:23,990
time we've given a tandem talk together

11
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:26,490
manjar has given most of this talk

12
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:28,830
before but not without me here to hassle

13
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:32,399
him and take over half of it so let us

14
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:33,690
know how it goes by heckling us

15
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:36,780
throughout please heed there we go there

16
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:37,770
we go all right

17
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:40,890
cueing it this is us we're Connors and

18
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:43,950
MBO on Twitter and github I'm just

19
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:45,090
kidding I'm not gonna use that's how you

20
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:48,300
can find as Alex said we both work at

21
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:50,129
github I've been there for just over two

22
00:00:50,129 --> 00:00:51,899
years Connor a little over a year and a

23
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:55,140
half we work on github calm basically

24
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:56,370
but a couple of different product

25
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:57,420
features around there which we'll talked

26
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:58,829
about talked about a little bit later

27
00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:01,050
before that we both worked at Twitter I

28
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:02,190
worked there for two and a half years

29
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:04,379
Connor about the same amount as well I

30
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:05,820
was pretty good time together

31
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:07,200
we've actually been together for about

32
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,810
six years now it's the second longest

33
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:12,630
relationship I've ever had in addition

34
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:14,880
to work in a cool product companies we

35
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,729
we really like open source I created

36
00:01:17,729 --> 00:01:20,280
bootstrap which is the be and Connor

37
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,770
created ratchet which is the are both of

38
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:24,659
them are front-end frameworks ratchet is

39
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:25,799
for if you ever heard a ratchet ratchet

40
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:27,119
is for basically if you want to build

41
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:29,790
mobile applications in HTML CSS that's

42
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:32,070
what that does for you bootstrap then is

43
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:36,180
mobile to desktop bottom line was point

44
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:37,470
of mentioning this is that we've spent a

45
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:39,509
lot of time writing HTML and CSS Adam

46
00:01:39,509 --> 00:01:41,460
mentioned he's been writing CSS for 10

47
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:43,380
years I don't mean to one-up him but as

48
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:45,530
a good friend of him I will he does by

49
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:49,799
15 years and it's awesome but anyway

50
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:51,479
here's gonna take it away now with his

51
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:54,860
talk all right

52
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:56,810
all right you can sit down it's fine um

53
00:01:56,810 --> 00:01:59,330
cool so yeah thanks for letting us be

54
00:01:59,330 --> 00:01:59,840
here

55
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,970
so we're designers right so this

56
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:03,350
conference is really interesting I've

57
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:05,300
been to a number of them one other one I

58
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:08,330
don't know I exaggerated anyways up in

59
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:10,580
Australia once but anyways what's really

60
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:11,720
cool about this is that we've got like

61
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,580
designers and developers right like we

62
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:16,820
got a mix of people and you know even

63
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:18,230
though we're product designers that's

64
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:20,060
sort of what we identify as like when

65
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:21,560
people say what do you do I'm a designer

66
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,990
right but we write a lot of code and and

67
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:26,000
we work with a lot of engineers every

68
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,970
day and you know fancy to say we've

69
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:30,950
written some Ruby before and JavaScript

70
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:33,020
so I mean a lot of these principles even

71
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:33,920
though we're talking about design a

72
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,780
little bit you know it applies to

73
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:38,930
everybody so we're gonna step back and

74
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:40,850
just talk a little bit about like design

75
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:42,760
in general like what do we actually mean

76
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:46,340
because I think it's important so yeah

77
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:47,750
design is a process I'm not gonna read

78
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,130
just every slide by the way I now keep

79
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:51,200
I'm looking up there yeah design is a

80
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,800
process and it's getting to a solution

81
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:56,060
you got a problem you trying to solve it

82
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:58,580
and a lot of times design kind of looks

83
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:00,320
something like this and hopefully you

84
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:03,590
can see the circles they look little dim

85
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:06,019
but anyways you know you do a lot of

86
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:07,190
sketching and do a lot of wireframe

87
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:08,840
getting Photoshop you get in the code

88
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,610
and it's like this whole big ordeal it's

89
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:12,620
exhausting design gosh it's supposed to

90
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:14,570
be this uppity like thing right we're

91
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:18,019
all designers and we realize that like

92
00:03:18,019 --> 00:03:20,600
really just solving the same problems

93
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,769
like over and over again in different

94
00:03:21,769 --> 00:03:23,720
fidelity right were you sketching and

95
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,739
I'm not saying anything I mean this is

96
00:03:24,739 --> 00:03:26,360
bad like this is a good good step but

97
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,190
when you're sketching like you're trying

98
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:29,330
to solve the problem then you get the

99
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:30,380
wireframes you get a little bit more

100
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:32,000
context and like you get a little more

101
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,650
handle on the problem you realize that

102
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:34,760
all those decisions you made are

103
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,290
probably wrong or like half of them

104
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:37,940
wrong so start making them again and

105
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:39,890
then you get the Photoshop and you spend

106
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:41,630
a lot of time in Photoshop and you're

107
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:43,070
doing that and and then you get into

108
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:44,090
code and you realize all of those

109
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:45,530
decisions were stupid you wasted all

110
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:46,700
your time you have to read make all

111
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:48,260
those decisions as soon as you do things

112
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:49,610
like what Adam was talking about in here

113
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:51,590
you know you have people using the thing

114
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:53,239
and it's a real tangible piece of

115
00:03:53,239 --> 00:03:56,390
software that you build and really what

116
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:58,790
it boils down to for us at least and

117
00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:01,100
based on our you know the six years

118
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:03,620
we've been together as mark says it

119
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:05,000
boils down to just working through ideas

120
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,220
and no matter what we do and then moving

121
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:08,270
into CODIS

122
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:09,230
quickly as we can because that's

123
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:11,210
actually where you know we think the

124
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:14,270
best part of design is made and and yeah

125
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:15,980
so I mean this is the point sort of what

126
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:17,780
we're thinking about is that practice

127
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:19,489
I'm greatly improves when you move into

128
00:04:19,489 --> 00:04:21,860
code the design process becomes way more

129
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:23,900
clear and focused your decisions become

130
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:26,960
quicker they become clearer and we think

131
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,880
they just make for better products and

132
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,800
that's why we like HTML and CSS we spend

133
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,500
obviously bootstrap we spend a lot of

134
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:39,650
time working with CSS so so why why this

135
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:41,360
code make it better

136
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,640
well I think the first thing is that it

137
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:46,820
actually elevates the conversation so I

138
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:48,350
don't know about you guys but I've been

139
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:49,820
in like a lot you know I spent some time

140
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:51,920
doing like contracting work and stuff

141
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:54,370
back in the day or old graphic design

142
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:56,630
boutique firms and things like that and

143
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:58,280
you spent a lot of time like biessing

144
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:00,320
everyone you know like hey look at you

145
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,060
know this is the theme and the metaphor

146
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:03,380
we're working with no that's bad I don't

147
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:06,620
mean to like downplay it but a lot of

148
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:07,970
times you end up like looking at a

149
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:10,490
picture of software and that's not very

150
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:13,370
helpful like oh you know design is the

151
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:15,740
thing we're building it's not the file

152
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:17,240
that goes into the trashcan after we're

153
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:20,630
done and and so this conversation we've

154
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:22,100
time and time again and meetings like

155
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:24,140
you're looking at this piece of paper

156
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:25,880
and you're trying to make decisions and

157
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,620
what that boils down to is arguments

158
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:29,870
over box-shadow or I guess drop shadow

159
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:31,130
if you're talking in Photoshop terms

160
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:33,290
like whatever like these conversations

161
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:35,420
kind of get stupid so when you're

162
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:37,490
dealing with like code and you can get

163
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:39,980
real data in there and real feels it

164
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:43,130
feels real you know it all sudden your

165
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:45,560
conversation becomes way more focus so

166
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:47,150
that's one reason why you should move in

167
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:49,820
the code quicker your decisions get

168
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:51,230
faster and hopefully your product

169
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:56,380
development cycle is is faster code

170
00:05:56,380 --> 00:06:00,500
inherently promotes or ideally promotes

171
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:03,050
systemic design and by systemic design

172
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:05,330
we just mean like design patterns I you

173
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:07,520
know as you're designing things you find

174
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,960
that you're building the same thing over

175
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,220
and over again well maybe you should

176
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:11,600
simplify that we just got done talking

177
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,669
about a a talk that does is talking

178
00:06:13,669 --> 00:06:15,200
about this exact same thing but even

179
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,990
like on a higher level than just CSS

180
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:19,540
attributes we're talking about like

181
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:21,560
modules on the side like

182
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:24,260
a user card on say a social media site

183
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:26,000
or something like that like we ended up

184
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,250
making those user cards like 15,000

185
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:30,320
times and they're all different it ends

186
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,820
up being like 5,000 lines of code and

187
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:33,230
that's no good

188
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:35,240
and that 5,000 lines of code is off

189
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,669
oftentimes like a very good indicator of

190
00:06:37,669 --> 00:06:39,950
maybe you need to simplify make it one

191
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:42,020
module that works everywhere and so much

192
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:44,180
simpler amount of code so code allows

193
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:46,220
you to figure that stuff out way easier

194
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:48,740
than a Photoshop document or maybe 50

195
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:51,620
Photoshop documents up on this wall and

196
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:54,650
we'll go over that and a little bit but

197
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:57,560
lastly and I think most importantly and

198
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,940
I think this conference is a testament

199
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:00,380
to this is that it lets you speak the

200
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:03,680
same language we're all here and we can

201
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,210
all talk to each other and we have a

202
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:06,889
commonality no matter if you are like a

203
00:07:06,889 --> 00:07:08,960
hardcore visual designer that works with

204
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:12,260
CSS or a hardcore you know engineer and

205
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:14,000
it's working mainly with JavaScript or

206
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,639
whatever you know go down the list we

207
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:18,200
all can look at this stuff and it's blue

208
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,120
down to text that we can all speak the

209
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,919
same language and we call with software

210
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:25,040
like github shameless plug we can all

211
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,419
work together and I think that's really

212
00:07:26,419 --> 00:07:28,190
important because it's really hard you

213
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:29,419
know Marc and I tried to like

214
00:07:29,419 --> 00:07:32,210
collaborate over you know this document

215
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:34,250
this keynote document it went horrible

216
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:35,660
it was terrible I just didn't make any

217
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:37,789
change there's terrible but code like

218
00:07:37,789 --> 00:07:39,289
this is all just a code which I guess we

219
00:07:39,289 --> 00:07:40,390
could have done that I don't know

220
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:43,400
realization right now um wouldn't let us

221
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,510
speak the same language work better

222
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:45,890
together so I think that's another

223
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:49,940
benefit of the design process in code so

224
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:54,200
anyways so putting that into perspective

225
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,910
a little bit though one of the the

226
00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:57,889
biggest projects that Connor and I the I

227
00:07:57,889 --> 00:07:59,990
guess the privilege to work on was nunu

228
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:01,669
Twitter and if you're not familiar this

229
00:08:01,669 --> 00:08:02,840
hashtag nunu Twitter

230
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:05,060
refers to the version of Twitter comm

231
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:07,130
and then the mobile clients that came

232
00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:10,000
out exactly three years in one day ago

233
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,840
which was when they went from the

234
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,400
sliding drawer to the expanding

235
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:16,039
collapsing tweets on Twitter com we

236
00:08:16,039 --> 00:08:17,570
worked on that we worked on for that for

237
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:20,990
six months in early 2000 or mid 2011 all

238
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:24,800
the way to early December so the gist of

239
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,240
this talk should be stuff that hopefully

240
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,370
we all realized and at least know or

241
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:29,659
I've heard people talk about which is

242
00:08:29,659 --> 00:08:32,000
that code is better let's get the code

243
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:32,959
faster because that's where everything

244
00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:34,370
is going to be anyway so why don't you

245
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:35,090
move there very quick

246
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:36,529
so hopefully this shouldn't be anything

247
00:08:36,529 --> 00:08:38,479
too profound we just want to explain

248
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:39,950
some some cool stories I think from this

249
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:42,229
so this is new new Twitter this is what

250
00:08:42,229 --> 00:08:44,060
it looked like it's kind of pretty

251
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:45,500
similar still except they've changed the

252
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:46,940
header and a couple of things they've

253
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:49,460
doesn't some new type and whatnot but so

254
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:51,200
Jack Dorsey came back and Bennett

255
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,270
mid-2011 he's like I'm gonna put my mark

256
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:55,820
on this this product again and so he

257
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:57,050
pulled a bunch of designers there about

258
00:08:57,050 --> 00:08:59,060
a dozen of us or so into a conference

259
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:02,180
room and we basically stayed there for

260
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:03,740
four weeks it was a four-week design

261
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:07,430
sprint and the idea was to basically

262
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:09,680
whiteboard and then go to photoshop and

263
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,779
mock up the iPhone clients and the the

264
00:09:11,779 --> 00:09:13,670
desktop web clients of how this brand

265
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:15,260
new reimagining of his product would

266
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:17,660
look and so it wasn't very pretty to

267
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:19,310
start there's a lot of sketches here

268
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:20,870
that's a lot like there's a nav mental

269
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:22,250
model I don't remember what it was but

270
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:23,900
there was three circles above and I

271
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:24,950
think that's what we're getting at we

272
00:09:24,950 --> 00:09:27,290
just need three things but I was like we

273
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:28,550
couldn't figure in that out by just

274
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:30,710
whiteboarding and doing tons of

275
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:32,510
Photoshop mock-ups and I can tell you

276
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:33,890
why we didn't figure it out by doing

277
00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:35,570
tons of Photoshop mock-ups so we did a

278
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:38,240
ton of Photoshop mock-ups for every

279
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,070
single view and it's a little grainy

280
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:41,660
it's actually horrible to look at I'm

281
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:44,540
sorry but we had these monster documents

282
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:46,070
and these are literally every single one

283
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:48,770
of these phones and screens is a PSD and

284
00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:50,570
when we updated one we had to update

285
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:53,600
about 4,000 more which was awesome at

286
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,370
the time but not really and we did the

287
00:09:55,370 --> 00:09:56,930
same for desktop and then we did the

288
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:59,360
same for our m5 client html5 client

289
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,470
they'd be the same for our Android

290
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:02,030
client and so that was the first four

291
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:03,380
weeks it was awesome we just

292
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:05,540
photoshopped all the things and then

293
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:08,420
then our boss pulls us aside and he

294
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:10,820
tells us this scope prototype it but

295
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:12,110
don't write prototype code this is gonna

296
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:13,220
write production cuz we're not time to

297
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:15,920
write prototype code and we're like cool

298
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:19,610
look at this we got this do this and

299
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:21,589
then let me start think about cuz we're

300
00:10:21,589 --> 00:10:23,180
gonna write we write twitter calm that's

301
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:25,700
so that's unbelievably awesome and then

302
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:29,060
it's oh no what are we gonna do how do

303
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:31,730
we do that this is range of emotions in

304
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:33,620
this couple of weeks while we try to do

305
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:36,200
this and so myself Connor and one of the

306
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,970
guy are on this we're tasked with

307
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:39,410
rewriting all of Twitter comms

308
00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:41,870
HTML and CSS and we're like let's just

309
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:43,430
start programming let's just get right

310
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:44,030
to it

311
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:45,709
shout-out to Jessica Dillon for the

312
00:10:45,709 --> 00:10:47,630
photo here she tweeted it a couple

313
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:48,350
months ago

314
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:49,670
I think it's fantastic so we just

315
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:52,280
started coding and the first this is the

316
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,600
first time we actually realized this

317
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,270
which is that PSD s don't mean squat

318
00:10:56,270 --> 00:10:57,800
when you're building things on the web

319
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,390
because you'll have this pixel perfect

320
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:01,610
design but once you actually start to

321
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:02,780
code it you realize all these different

322
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:04,100
things and a lot of madama brought up as

323
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:06,920
well and is that you're gonna have all

324
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,540
these different people accessing this

325
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:09,680
content from different devices and you

326
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,090
don't know their situation you just have

327
00:11:11,090 --> 00:11:12,740
to do your best to accommodate for all

328
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:15,020
those unknowns and so when we started

329
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:16,880
coding this we cut it up and maybe like

330
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,830
a week of real basic prototype here of

331
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:20,930
it and then we loaded it 97 it just

332
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:24,020
promptly crashed the entire computer fun

333
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:25,670
fact this is because we were using HTML

334
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:28,010
semantic elements and the html5 shim

335
00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:29,600
which apparently just didn't work for IE

336
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,400
7 welcome that's that version or

337
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,080
something so we had to scrap all those

338
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:35,720
plans and we rewrote that entirely but

339
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:36,980
we didn't we would not have realized

340
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:38,660
that if we just stuck in Photoshop for

341
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:39,830
even longer while we try to figure out

342
00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:42,200
design decisions one of those design

343
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,990
decisions for example was consolidating

344
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:46,940
all these similar things into one

345
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:48,680
component one instance of this component

346
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:50,510
one do one thing have one thing do one

347
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:53,450
thing really really well and an example

348
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:55,280
of that is like an avatar full name

349
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:57,170
username or two lines of text next to it

350
00:11:57,170 --> 00:12:00,680
we had about six of those in those four

351
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:02,720
thousand mock-ups and Photoshop that we

352
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,240
had done and so when we got them and

353
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,740
we're starting to code this for the

354
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:08,240
engineers with the engineers we're

355
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,560
seeing stuff like this where it's like

356
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:11,840
this is the same thing but slightly

357
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:14,720
different and we'd be into lazy people

358
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,130
that we are we don't want to code the

359
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:18,560
same thing multiple times so we said no

360
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,360
no we're doing one thing and this is

361
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:22,280
what it's going to be and so we become

362
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,750
like we became like an intermediary

363
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:25,310
between the rest of design and the

364
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:26,920
people that actually know engineering

365
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:29,030
where that are writing all the

366
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:30,620
JavaScript and then the the rails code

367
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:32,210
to actually power this stuff one

368
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:34,070
component one piece of data it pushed

369
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:35,630
the product forward because instead of

370
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:37,310
having six different things that users

371
00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:38,930
would see that are slightly the same

372
00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:40,490
there was either gonna see just one

373
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:41,870
thing and that's how they know they're

374
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:43,040
actually looking at Twitter they've seen

375
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,050
the same thing what's actually

376
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:46,460
interesting about this is it Maps really

377
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:47,810
well up to today's frameworks and style

378
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:49,370
guides if you go to a company they have

379
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:50,810
a style guide this is how we do this

380
00:12:50,810 --> 00:12:53,480
this how we do buttons and forms and how

381
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,830
we lay out our pages and things like

382
00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:56,570
that it's a lot of that shared knowledge

383
00:12:56,570 --> 00:12:58,390
but a lot of its also unique

384
00:12:58,390 --> 00:13:01,670
lastly three years ago we didn't really

385
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:03,440
know this like this is still thing

386
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,550
people are talking about today is like

387
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:06,470
it's at github it's not it's not shipped

388
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:09,350
until it's fast and at Twitter when

389
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:11,900
we're crashing things that 500 million

390
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:13,820
monthly uniques I think we're trying to

391
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:16,520
access that's not a good thing so speed

392
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:18,440
becomes the future that we talk about so

393
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,940
instead of having the conversation about

394
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:22,250
what size box yet oh we're gonna use we

395
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:24,500
said no no no no box shadow because

396
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,540
browsers three years ago couldn't do it

397
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:29,000
especially ie9 at the time just one of

398
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,380
the amount of box shows we wanted to do

399
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:31,910
and if remember twitter.com it's

400
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:33,170
infinite scroll you just getting more

401
00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:34,970
and more tweets more and more box

402
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:37,700
shadows it's just just bringing the page

403
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:39,560
to a crawl so it answered all those

404
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:41,210
stylistic questions and allowed us to

405
00:13:41,210 --> 00:13:42,980
focus on the actual interactions and the

406
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:44,780
speed and the overall picture of the

407
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:46,820
product and it was immensely useful and

408
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:48,890
I think I can speak for the both of us

409
00:13:48,890 --> 00:13:50,240
want to say it was by far the most

410
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,470
illuminated an awesome product we've

411
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:52,010
ever worked on

412
00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:56,170
you're not allowed to speak for me but

413
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:59,300
it's carried forward in the three years

414
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:01,160
since then that we released that and two

415
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,840
more projects we worked on at Twitter

416
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,630
and even practice worked on github so

417
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:07,430
see what that looks like yeah so I mean

418
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:08,900
we talked a little bit about Twitter we

419
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:10,910
joke around like it's been like two and

420
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:12,290
a half almost three years since we're at

421
00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:13,520
Twitter we should probably stop talking

422
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,260
about Twitter for a while all right it's

423
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:18,470
it's in the past mark anyways so let's

424
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:25,520
talk about Twitter a little bit we did

425
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:27,230
twitter.com your new Twitter and then we

426
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:28,610
had to iterate on it so I mean one of

427
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:30,560
the first projects we sort of picked up

428
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,320
after that was the profile redesign so

429
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:35,360
you kind of have me to blame for like

430
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,370
this well not really I can't really take

431
00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:38,990
credit for the center to avatar somebody

432
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:41,170
centered an avatar before I did but

433
00:14:41,170 --> 00:14:43,190
anyways we started doing this project

434
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:45,350
and you know we started falling into the

435
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:47,420
same traps like alright let's start

436
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:49,850
doing Photoshop documents for a thousand

437
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:52,930
different iterate or like every you know

438
00:14:52,930 --> 00:14:56,210
permutation of this profile everything

439
00:14:56,210 --> 00:14:58,850
that could happen so yeah we did that

440
00:14:58,850 --> 00:15:00,530
for about a day I was like oh Wayne I

441
00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:02,330
remember we already figured out what not

442
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:03,770
to do in this project so we started

443
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:05,780
coding it again right and this is just a

444
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:07,370
mobile prototype you know we mentioned

445
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:09,020
that a lot of bootstrap and ratchet are

446
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:10,340
open source projects came out of our

447
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:12,230
work at Twitter well this is a perfect

448
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:13,370
example this is like sort of what

449
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:16,010
ratchet started which was a mobile Iowa

450
00:15:16,010 --> 00:15:18,500
prototyping tool originally came out of

451
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,180
and so we started building this stuff

452
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:21,710
and it you know it did a couple of

453
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:23,290
things obviously we already talked about

454
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:26,360
letting us figure out you know real data

455
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,520
even if it's just JSON dumps that we

456
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:31,910
were able to plug in it let us do user

457
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:34,040
testing let us get in front of users and

458
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,840
actually hand it to them but one of the

459
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,520
biggest things this particular project

460
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,680
actually taught us was they allowed a

461
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:42,380
small group of people to get a lot of

462
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:44,840
momentum around a very simple idea and a

463
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,520
big company I don't know about you guys

464
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:48,050
like obviously you know I hadn't

465
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:49,370
mentioned Salesforce that's a pretty big

466
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:49,880
company

467
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,650
well little bigger some medium-sized

468
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:53,930
would you say anyways yeah we some of us

469
00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:55,580
may work at big companies it's really

470
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:57,980
hard to get momentum going well I think

471
00:15:57,980 --> 00:16:00,080
code and our experience is it's proven

472
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,280
that it's like really easy to get

473
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,750
momentum when you're actually to have

474
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:04,790
something that feels real so in this

475
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:07,040
particular case like we're running a

476
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,180
bunch of red blocks I won't name names

477
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:10,460
but anyways I'm just kidding I will name

478
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:14,960
names it was Marc Jacobs I was able to

479
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,640
take you know the phone and say alright

480
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:18,110
here's this profile here's something

481
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:19,460
cool we could do really quickly and just

482
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:21,320
go up to the CEO go up to dick and say

483
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:23,510
hey man can we build this they could be

484
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:24,770
really cool if we could build this and

485
00:16:24,770 --> 00:16:26,810
of course he's like it looks done why

486
00:16:26,810 --> 00:16:28,760
isn't it shipped right because you know

487
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:30,170
he's not trying to figure out this low

488
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:32,120
level organizational crap he just wants

489
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:34,310
to ship product and get stuff done and

490
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:36,470
so like you know you get that momentum

491
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:38,870
going and yeah it's really cool so I

492
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:41,900
mean this is just one example so again

493
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,970
not to talk about Twitter forever

494
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:46,280
I went over to github and you know we've

495
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:48,020
been talking a lot about big projects

496
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:50,030
like new Twitter and profiles that's

497
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:52,340
pretty cool but this really just applies

498
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:53,660
to everything so this is a really small

499
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:55,670
project first project I worked on it I

500
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:58,610
get up I just sort of grabbed you know I

501
00:16:58,610 --> 00:16:59,900
looked at the site and I was like what

502
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:02,180
sucks on github.com that I could fix

503
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:04,459
really simply and it was our Senate page

504
00:17:04,459 --> 00:17:07,280
our joint page and I sort of was able to

505
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,420
open up a pull request and of course

506
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:10,550
this is what github is based around open

507
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:11,959
up a poll or Kratz cut a branch and

508
00:17:11,959 --> 00:17:14,570
start working on it so it's really cool

509
00:17:14,570 --> 00:17:16,459
to be able to like get in there and

510
00:17:16,459 --> 00:17:18,490
start designing some stuff but just

511
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:20,540
roping back to like that design process

512
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:23,030
it's not saying this isn't a design in

513
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:24,199
the browser talk like we're not trying

514
00:17:24,199 --> 00:17:27,050
to say like old design philosophies and

515
00:17:27,050 --> 00:17:29,870
old design techniques are antiquated and

516
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:31,460
throw them out and you're a loser if use

517
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:34,430
them cuz I sketch all day long like this

518
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:36,590
is sort of like what I think is you know

519
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:38,300
one of the things that allows you to

520
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:39,770
even code faster is getting your ideas

521
00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:41,059
really quickly going back to that

522
00:17:41,059 --> 00:17:42,770
simplified process just get your idea

523
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:44,690
out as quickly as possible whether it's

524
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:47,059
a sharpie or a pin and then move it

525
00:17:47,059 --> 00:17:49,130
through to code as quickly as possible

526
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:51,170
so I mean this is just a quick flow but

527
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:53,210
it's another example of how we were able

528
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:55,850
to get momentum around in just a new

529
00:17:55,850 --> 00:17:57,590
company I didn't know anybody but mark

530
00:17:57,590 --> 00:18:00,260
and be able to get something ship really

531
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:01,940
quickly and obviously that it's gonna

532
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:03,800
vary you're gonna get different mileage

533
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,780
from company company but in general

534
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:07,790
whether there's a lot of bureaucracy or

535
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:10,340
none at all like it's proven to be like

536
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:13,100
a really good technique and of the many

537
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:14,630
right ways of doing something this is

538
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:19,610
one that's worked out for us the other

539
00:18:19,610 --> 00:18:21,670
one for me has been split this which

540
00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:24,110
until very recently was probably the

541
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:25,970
most requested feature in all of github

542
00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:28,309
history how many people use split this

543
00:18:28,309 --> 00:18:32,600
side by side this yes nobody like half

544
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:33,950
the room at least half the room Connor

545
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:37,160
come on you guys check so in addition to

546
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:39,559
Pawnee bridge names we jump right into

547
00:18:39,559 --> 00:18:40,730
polar coasts because we can actually

548
00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:43,130
show people these things I bought a year

549
00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:44,780
and a half ago I did a quick mock-up and

550
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:47,120
then tweedle Twitter with some code and

551
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,950
tried to make side-by-side this happen I

552
00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:50,240
just couldn't because the code was so

553
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,059
convoluted in that case I got shut down

554
00:18:52,059 --> 00:18:54,200
I'm gonna shut myself down by trying to

555
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,210
do even more mock-ups with it and then I

556
00:18:56,210 --> 00:18:57,679
got a little more momentum behind me and

557
00:18:57,679 --> 00:18:59,240
I was able to do it after some brief

558
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:02,420
refactoring to our diffing code and we

559
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:04,130
made it happen by opening the polar

560
00:19:04,130 --> 00:19:05,600
quest and exactly two months later we

561
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,010
had it shipped to the entire user base

562
00:19:07,010 --> 00:19:09,950
and so went about two and a half weeks

563
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:11,870
of like in this code in this in this

564
00:19:11,870 --> 00:19:13,820
pull request here and it includes

565
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:14,900
screenshots from the stuff that I'd

566
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:17,480
worked on you see today's split this

567
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:19,190
actually collapsed the additions and

568
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:23,300
deletions onto us combined rows whereas

569
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:24,830
the original prototype didn't so that

570
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:26,750
was a product decision we made after we

571
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:28,490
started feeling it out in the browser

572
00:19:28,490 --> 00:19:29,809
after we start actually using it

573
00:19:29,809 --> 00:19:31,490
ourselves because do you imagine trying

574
00:19:31,490 --> 00:19:34,309
design like dips in Photoshop or sketch

575
00:19:34,309 --> 00:19:35,840
that sounds horrendous I'd have to copy

576
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,309
and paste code a bunch of times and then

577
00:19:37,309 --> 00:19:38,840
by the way we just shipped syntax

578
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:40,520
highlighting on tips today we'd have to

579
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:42,140
do that to you because that was going on

580
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:43,820
at the same time and trying to recreate

581
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:45,530
all this stuff which is horrible so we

582
00:19:45,530 --> 00:19:46,910
figure out the basics jumped into code

583
00:19:46,910 --> 00:19:48,679
open up a branch or start a branch open

584
00:19:48,679 --> 00:19:50,360
a pull request and we got this cool

585
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:51,860
thing at the top my top comment you can

586
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:53,060
actually play with it on a staging

587
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:54,320
environment cuz I have a cool thing

588
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,970
called branch labs we just push code out

589
00:19:55,970 --> 00:19:58,790
there and I got some vulgar commits and

590
00:19:58,790 --> 00:20:00,650
some really shitty commits there too and

591
00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:02,720
we just kept iterating on this branch

592
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,250
and we actually got to play with it and

593
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:05,690
that's the point is that you get to did

594
00:20:05,690 --> 00:20:07,280
you get to those real fields of like oh

595
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,570
click this button all the sudden I have

596
00:20:08,570 --> 00:20:10,100
a split diff and I'm writing these

597
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:11,450
comments on one side and these comments

598
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:13,130
on another side I'm telling Conor how

599
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:14,720
awesome or how bad his code is and

600
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,850
that's awesome that's how we should be

601
00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:18,590
doing these things as close to the end

602
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:21,110
goal as possible and that's what we

603
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:22,490
basically want to reiterate today is

604
00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:25,010
just that get to code real fast and no

605
00:20:25,010 --> 00:20:26,150
matter if you're a designer or developer

606
00:20:26,150 --> 00:20:28,130
by title you will be an awesome product

607
00:20:28,130 --> 00:20:29,870
designer because you're building it

608
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:31,520
where it's gonna end up and that's

609
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,320
what's most exciting about what we do

610
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:35,750
why we write all the HTML CSS that we do

611
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:38,360
and that I think about wraps it up for

612
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:40,520
us thanks so much for coming out
