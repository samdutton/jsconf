1
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:11,780
Thank you for having having me.

2
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:13,059
My name is Alvaro Videla.

3
00:00:13,059 --> 00:00:16,160
I'm from Uruguay.

4
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:22,279
I work as an engineer on a SQL database.

5
00:00:22,279 --> 00:00:29,270
Please visit the websites so my manager knows
I'm here!

6
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:31,050
[Laughter].

7
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:36,850
I wrote this article laugh year which got
100,000 visits.

8
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:39,000
Basically explaining my story on how I got
into programming.

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:47,249
Ten years ago, I was basically selling food
in the streets in the countryside of Uruguay.

10
00:00:47,249 --> 00:00:53,640
But this talk is called metaphors we compute
by and you can read it on the ACMQ website,

11
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:59,640
and the communications of the ACM.

12
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:03,559
The year is 1980, one year earlier for me
being born.

13
00:01:03,559 --> 00:01:09,970
There is a book published called Metaphors
We Live By, so you can tell the title of my

14
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:16,850
talk is nothing original, it is a copy of
that ing, because this work was so influential

15
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:29,159
that, after it came, metaphors we socialise
by, so, this work the idea was to study the

16
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:35,490
brain because they would scientists, but you
cannot go and open people's brains and see

17
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:36,490
what is there inside.

18
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:39,780
That's kind of illegal — it tends to be.

19
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:45,679
So they say, okay, try to understand the brain,
by using a proxy, which is language.

20
00:01:45,679 --> 00:01:55,210
And they found out that metaphor isn't just
a matter of poetry, like rhetoric al flourish.

21
00:01:55,210 --> 00:02:05,399
Metaphors dictate how we think, behave, how
we perceive, and how our conceptual system

22
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:08,050
is built.

23
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:14,370
To give you an example, the first from their
book, they say argument is war.

24
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:17,970
War is a metaphor in which we frame argument.

25
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:21,580
I think this is kind of in line with the previous
talk.

26
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:25,260
Why people have these flame wars on the internet?

27
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:32,580
If we think of argument as war, we will say
things like, "Your claims are indefensible."

28
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:37,370
"He attacked every weak point in my argument.

29
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:40,110
I demolished his argument.

30
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:43,280
I never won an argument with him.

31
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,420
His criticisms were right on target."

32
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:53,630
The point being, because of this framing of
as a war, we literally tried to destroy the

33
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:55,260
other person.

34
00:02:55,260 --> 00:03:00,962
And they ask in this book, asked like what
if argument will be dance which is a kind

35
00:03:00,962 --> 00:03:08,090
of metaphor using, and then thinking about
arguments, because we need to collaborate

36
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:12,740
together to reach a common goal, and then
maybe a metaphor would be you should not be

37
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:15,690
stepping on my toes or something like that.

38
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:18,690
It will be a more collaborative thing.

39
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:21,860
But I can see your favourites that you're
not convinced.

40
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:26,680
When people are not convinced, we talk about
politics, right?

41
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:34,110
There was a really nice article from the BBC
called How metaphors Shape Women's Lives,

42
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:42,210
but but it talked about all this glass-ceiling
metaphor, what not, how you're stopped from

43
00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:47,010
progressing at companies, but for me, even
more interesting in that article, was this

44
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:54,480
research done where they grabbed a group of
student, and they tell them there is a wild

45
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:57,260
beast preying on the city.

46
00:03:57,260 --> 00:04:00,260
Crime is a wild beet preying on the city.

47
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:04,700
The other they say that a virus is infecting
the city.

48
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:08,210
Both groups get the same data, statistics
and so on.

49
00:04:08,210 --> 00:04:11,010
They have a different framing metaphor.

50
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:22,230
When people are asked what are the solutions
they propose, 75 per cent of the beast students,

51
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:26,560
they wanted to put people in jail and do strong
punishments.

52
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:33,100
The people in the virus case wanted to help
the other and help them, improve, progress,

53
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:34,100
and so on.

54
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:37,960
When they asked them why did you choose that
kind of punishment, or why do you want to

55
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:40,910
kill people, get better, and so on?

56
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:43,870
They say, "Because the data says so."

57
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:48,360
None of them realised they were primed with
a particular metaphor.

58
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:58,240
There is also a book from the 1980s called
Feminism Confronts Technology, and it's really

59
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:04,430
good if you want to have a deep dive into
feminist point of view into technology.

60
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:10,840
And it is like how the words "hard" and "soft
"have been changing across the history of

61
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,780
technology.

62
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:19,000
At some point, intellectual work was not considered
interesting, whatever, and the machos out

63
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:26,960
there deemed the work soft, and suddenly,
we have computers, so all this macho mentality

64
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:34,810
brought the "hard" word into programming with
these aggressive metaphors, like you need

65
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:44,830
to be coding 24/7, pushing for that release,
about your stamina, and so on.

66
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:56,090
She said no matter how masculinity is defined,
it always construes women as ill-suited to

67
00:05:56,090 --> 00:05:57,870
technological pursuits.

68
00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:06,610
Language is also important, even if how we
approach different groups if you want to make,

69
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:11,040
for example, technology frame there for women,
friendly for women or other groups like in

70
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:14,440
Latin America, for example.

71
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:17,260
Still not convinced?

72
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:20,290
Human resource management.

73
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:25,220
If you think with this metaphor, you will
think that the same way that you replace a

74
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:31,120
hard drive on a server, you replace a programmer
on your team, and there are many managers

75
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:38,120
that think this way, but we need to understand
that people are not resources, like we are

76
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:44,370
not here ... [Cheering].

77
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:50,460
We bring more to the world that can be replaced.

78
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:56,700
We build interpersonal relationships, organise
things to happen in certain times, and so

79
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:57,700
on.

80
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:04,320
We are very rich living beings.

81
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:10,340
Finally, giving platform to racist people.

82
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:15,919
There is a conference in the United States,
I won't name them, that they like to have

83
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:18,900
keynoters, like racist people.

84
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:24,100
Last year, the keynoter, was one that considered
women to be inferior, and so on.

85
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:30,199
When the community came against this conference,
and they criticised them for having a racist

86
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:39,680
person as a keynoter, they wrote a blog post,
and it was called "wrestling with inclusion"

87
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:44,900
at whatever the name of that conf.

88
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:47,260
I wonder "wrestling".

89
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:50,090
Why do you need to wrestle with inclusion?

90
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:56,320
Why can't you have a dialogue or talk with
people involved in these communities?

91
00:07:56,320 --> 00:08:03,940
No, they decided to wrestle very, "I'm going
to beat you down", right?

92
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:09,470
I guess you're here to talk about computers,
right?

93
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:16,302
So computers: have you seen the movie "hidden
figures" where this astronaut from the States,

94
00:08:16,302 --> 00:08:23,760
this the black women helped put a man, an
American in space, the Russians had done that

95
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:28,510
already?

96
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:29,790
They were doing calculation.

97
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:33,370
They were doing computing by hand.

98
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:37,620
So these women were called computers.

99
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:46,029
But at some point, we had this very fast electronic
machine that was doing what they were doing

100
00:08:46,029 --> 00:08:52,660
really fast, so how do we call those things
that do what these people are already doing,

101
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:53,660
okay?

102
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:54,660
Automatic computers.

103
00:08:54,660 --> 00:09:00,220
The automatic word was dropped, and now we
just call them computers.

104
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:01,220
Why is this?

105
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:04,620
Because metaphors, they enable understanding.

106
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:10,860
When we don't know how to talk about something,
we probably will use some sort of a metaphor.

107
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:19,720
I don't remember yesterday if you give me
a second, I was watching a talk here about

108
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:33,749
simulation for blind people, he said additional
screen real estate that you account for.

109
00:09:33,749 --> 00:09:38,129
Now there is real estate that we account for.

110
00:09:38,129 --> 00:09:43,850
This is a metaphorical way of understanding
what is going on that is just the screen is

111
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:47,690
bigger and we need to do something with that
bigger screen.

112
00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:55,660
But when I say the metaphor to enable understanding,
the typical metaphor is from Shakespeare,

113
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:59,490
that says Juliet is like the sun.

114
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:04,970
And we need to understand that metaphors aren't
a one-to-one mapping between source domain

115
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:07,149
and target domain.

116
00:10:07,149 --> 00:10:13,910
Metaphors just illuminate some areas so we
understand what is meant but Juliet means

117
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:17,950
for Romeo in this case, his life depends on
her.

118
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:22,259
He resolves around her all day, he thought,
whatever.

119
00:10:22,259 --> 00:10:24,290
She is the light of his life.

120
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:31,639
We don't think Juliet gave him skin cancer
because we are smart enough to understand

121
00:10:31,639 --> 00:10:37,910
that metaphors are not a one-to-one mapping,
like Juliet is not an atomic bomb walking

122
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:40,300
around Italy, right?

123
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:51,240
There is a book by a guy I think from either
the Netherlands or Belgium, called the Geometry

124
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:54,809
of Meaning, semantics based on conceptual
spaces.

125
00:10:54,809 --> 00:11:03,639
Long story short: somebody got paid in Europe
for doing geometry research of language.

126
00:11:03,639 --> 00:11:05,560
These things in South America don't happen.

127
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:11,940
We try to make sure that our cows make better
meat, basically!

128
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:16,889
In that book, it is really interesting because
he said that metaphorical mappings preserve

129
00:11:16,889 --> 00:11:22,420
the cognitive topology of the source domain
in a way that is consistent with inherent

130
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:29,929
structure of the target domain, so, source,
sun, target, Juliet.

131
00:11:29,929 --> 00:11:36,000
Metaphor transfers information from one conceptual
domain to another, and what is transferred

132
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,450
is a pattern rather than domain-specific information.

133
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:45,689
Juliet is not giving you cancer, and a metaphor
can thus be used to identify structure in

134
00:11:45,689 --> 00:11:49,529
a domain that will not have been discovered
otherwise.

135
00:11:49,529 --> 00:11:55,139
So that is the power that metaphor brings
us when we need to understand how the world

136
00:11:55,139 --> 00:11:56,300
actually works.

137
00:11:56,300 --> 00:12:03,800
And, for me, I stole this animation from that
link town there, this is what we are doing

138
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,709
in a way with our brain, with metaphors.

139
00:12:05,709 --> 00:12:11,940
We're doing like a problem that we solve constantly
when we're able to apply a method in a context

140
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:14,259
that has nothing to do with it.

141
00:12:14,259 --> 00:12:20,720
This is how metaphors create new knowledge.

142
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:26,829
But the problem with metaphors is that they
also obscure understanding.

143
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:34,699
Back in the 18th century when they tried to
create the telegraph, the metaphor was the

144
00:12:34,699 --> 00:12:37,199
"far writing" tele graph.

145
00:12:37,199 --> 00:12:41,399
Because of this metaphor, they were so tied
to the metaphor, this they would create a

146
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:46,860
device that would write remotely instead of
[unclear] having something like Morse code

147
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:56,279
or whatever, because Morse code was not a
thing, thanks to — they started encoding

148
00:12:56,279 --> 00:13:03,269
on language, our language, in a different
code that is not the one that we use for speaking,

149
00:13:03,269 --> 00:13:09,319
humanity realised like okay, we can trust
that we talk in a different way before Morse

150
00:13:09,319 --> 00:13:17,370
code, before telegraph, we hadn't realised
as a species or society that we could do these

151
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:20,160
things with language.

152
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:31,170
In this book The Shadows said sometimes our
tools do what we tell them to, but otherwise,

153
00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:35,259
we adapt ourselves to our tool's requirements.

154
00:13:35,259 --> 00:13:36,749
We need to be careful with this.

155
00:13:36,749 --> 00:13:43,110
We're today adapted to having a phone and
Twitter every day, let's say.

156
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:46,980
Or back in the day when people invented this
in Switzerland.

157
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:51,410
I'm sure it wasn't invented in Switzerland
but I live there so I need to say these kinds

158
00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:53,279
of things!

159
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:59,589
Before people didn't live by the second or
the minute, whenever the church bell rang

160
00:13:59,589 --> 00:14:04,879
before the going to mass, or whatever this
be , they knew they had to gather at the town

161
00:14:04,879 --> 00:14:11,430
square, or something like that, but it wasn't
like they were clocking every single thing.

162
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:17,089
This is also, for example, I learned in London,
like this is why they know the exact locations

163
00:14:17,089 --> 00:14:21,180
when Jack the Ripper was doing things because
there are so many churches in London, that

164
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:25,929
they were hearing the bells, so after this
many bells, Jack the Ripper did something

165
00:14:25,929 --> 00:14:26,929
somewhere.

166
00:14:26,929 --> 00:14:29,399
That was a way of tracking time back then.

167
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:37,410
Today, we're totally adapted to having this
super precise information.

168
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:43,029
Metaphors are the tools of thought, so, going
back to the beginning of the talk, depending

169
00:14:43,029 --> 00:14:47,930
on the metaphors we use, it's how we understand
the world around us.

170
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:53,679
And also, how we can understand code.

171
00:14:53,679 --> 00:15:08,600
This paper, no-one knows who wrote this paper,
it would be to me is the best unknown paper.

172
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:13,350
It is from back in the 1960s, if I'm not mistaken.

173
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:22,640
And they say to programme is to write to another
parameter about our solution to a problem.

174
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:28,959
So programming is forget about the computer,
it's just a tool, what we are doing with programmes

175
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:33,089
is communicating ideas, communicating solutions.

176
00:15:33,089 --> 00:15:38,259
And, as they say also in the structure and
interpretation of computer programmes, programmes

177
00:15:38,259 --> 00:15:45,070
must be written for people to read, and only
incidentally for machines to execute.

178
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:46,809
And this is not something new.

179
00:15:46,809 --> 00:15:56,160
If we go back to the 1955/54, David Wheeler
from England, he invented the sub routine,

180
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:59,769
because that's what people in do in England,
they invent sub routines and computers, stuff

181
00:15:59,769 --> 00:16:01,829
like that.

182
00:16:01,829 --> 00:16:07,279
Anyway, at the end of the paper, he says that
there is no need for the sub routine when

183
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:15,089
you have assembly code, because the above
remarks might be summarised by saying sub

184
00:16:15,089 --> 00:16:21,489
routines are useful but not absolutely necessary,
and that the thing to be borne in mind when

185
00:16:21,489 --> 00:16:27,730
won instructing them is simplicity of use,
correctness of code.

186
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:31,889
All complexity shall be, if possible, be buried
out of site.

187
00:16:31,889 --> 00:16:33,839
Yes, there is no need for a sub routine.

188
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:35,800
There is no need for refactoring code.

189
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:41,089
But because we are communicating between people,
we want make sure we understand what they

190
00:16:41,089 --> 00:16:42,670
Waugh in that particular problem.

191
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:50,730
By the way, this woman here, this is a picture
from a book that David Woolly wrote because

192
00:16:50,730 --> 00:16:58,910
he wrote the first programming back in 1956
maybe or earlier, and this is the first programmer

193
00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:02,819
ever pictured in a programming book.

194
00:17:02,819 --> 00:17:10,960
So there you go with your — anyway — machitos
are the only ones programming.

195
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:16,189
If you look at the text below.

196
00:17:16,189 --> 00:17:20,470
Look at the text back then that were not metaphors.

197
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:29,740
She has a library of tapes where the sub routines
are punched, that was a natural library of

198
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:33,830
sub routines like some paper thing that they
will punch into the machine.

199
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:36,910
I don't even know.

200
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:39,690
Everything we talk is metaphorical in a way.

201
00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:42,210
You will see more later.

202
00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:45,420
But metaphors and code.

203
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:55,070
In code, I say that types are the characters
telling the story of your programmes, but

204
00:17:55,070 --> 00:18:04,250
for the Haskell people cheering behind, chillax,
because I'm not talking about those — data

205
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:06,590
types by Barbara Liskov.

206
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:14,790
She had to fight, you know this that we have
today on, if it was Twitter times, she was

207
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:24,100
full of those telling her that you don't need,
the construction was wrong, because they were

208
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:33,460
already in the post-war of go-to, and they
managed to move away from go-do in 1964, and

209
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:42,440
so on, so in 1974, but we also can do instruction,
and people were all fighting against her ideas.

210
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:46,679
But the problem is is that if we don't have
types, we just have operations on a stream

211
00:18:46,679 --> 00:18:48,269
of bytes.

212
00:18:48,269 --> 00:18:52,510
So let's talk about choosing the right data
structure.

213
00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:56,919
We have a problem where we needed, for example,
to count or to keep somewhere all the people

214
00:18:56,919 --> 00:19:00,600
that came to the JSConf EU.

215
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:04,100
You can use an array that works perfectly.

216
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:08,720
Put everybody inside there — fine.

217
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:17,690
If you use a metaphor that has a meaning,
it is telling you that that bunch of whatever

218
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:24,179
it is, in this case of users, those users
have to be unique, so just like changing the

219
00:19:24,179 --> 00:19:28,990
data type, you're telling me a lot of information
about how you solve your programme.

220
00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:32,559
If you use a living list, you're telling me
you can traverse this in this way but you

221
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:35,700
can do inserts however you want.

222
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:40,570
If you have a queue, you're telling me, first
in, first out.

223
00:19:40,570 --> 00:19:44,720
Stuck the reverse operation.

224
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:51,230
Because a programme, explanatory power, is
the measure of its own elegance.

225
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:58,059
If your programme can't explain what we are
trying to do, can't satisfy the initial goal.

226
00:19:58,059 --> 00:20:06,419
The data structures, they have explanatory
power that can give us cognitive lips.

227
00:20:06,419 --> 00:20:08,510
For example, scaling.

228
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:15,160
We want to be able to serve food based on
the order in which people arrive at the counter,

229
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:20,770
and blah, and their country's food, maybe
we need to bring another person to — too

230
00:20:20,770 --> 00:20:24,720
boring, but if we start talking about queuing
theory, we understand this is a problem in

231
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:29,920
queuing theory, not only we have a bunch of
languages to talk about that problem, there's

232
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:37,420
a whole theory of queuing that was developed
by airlines back in the 1930s for telecommunications,

233
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:43,789
and we can base analysis of the problem on
actual mathematical theory.

234
00:20:43,789 --> 00:20:47,320
The same here: how do I get from here to Tegel
Airport?

235
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:51,309
Number one, don't take the bus!

236
00:20:51,309 --> 00:20:57,299
You can try to guess and try many things,
but at some point, you will know, you have

237
00:20:57,299 --> 00:21:00,230
a graph theory problem here.

238
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:04,020
With there, we have the mathematics to solve
this.

239
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:10,919
By the way, not only that map is not a map
of the territory — if you have heard that

240
00:21:10,919 --> 00:21:17,120
sentence — the graph is a metaphor of that
territory, and that graph is enabling you

241
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:23,179
to do things to the territory, and also it's
for forbidding you to do things with the territory,

242
00:21:23,179 --> 00:21:31,580
so that metaphor of the graph in graph theory
and maps is what I was saying before: it has

243
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:33,580
constraining powers.

244
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:41,380
But I think the most interesting example from
the replication.

245
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:49,200
They tried to build an algorithm to spread
data using rumour-mongering, basically.

246
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:53,980
I am a computer, I have some data, I say to
this computer, and this other computer, and

247
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:58,980
then this computer spread the rumour to other
computers, and so on, like a Latin American

248
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:01,830
TV novella, the way to spread rumours.

249
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:06,059
This is the way we spread the word.

250
00:22:06,059 --> 00:22:14,210
The problem is really easy to explain with
this metaphor but it is really hard to reason

251
00:22:14,210 --> 00:22:19,090
of about the correct ness of the algorithms.

252
00:22:19,090 --> 00:22:32,990
But they saw that this also mapped to epidemics,
and, an epidemic, there is a book that is

253
00:22:32,990 --> 00:22:39,780
the mathematical fear from the 1940s and 1950s,
using the math in that book to prove their

254
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:45,110
algorithm will spread the data to all those
in the replication because they understood

255
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:50,100
another metaphor, the same way an epidemic
goes through a population is how you can send

256
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:52,900
data through a bunch of nodes.

257
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:58,399
And is everything a metaphor, then, like this
is what you're trying to say?

258
00:22:58,399 --> 00:22:59,669
Yes.

259
00:22:59,669 --> 00:23:07,550
Actually, when I was watching this film, I
heard her saying, "Metaphors be with you"

260
00:23:07,550 --> 00:23:11,159
because I was so in this thing.

261
00:23:11,159 --> 00:23:14,179
Did she really say metaphors be with you?

262
00:23:14,179 --> 00:23:15,309
Yes, she did!

263
00:23:15,309 --> 00:23:16,309
Everything is a metaphor.

264
00:23:16,309 --> 00:23:20,140
I don't believe you, I just read one slide,
because I don't have much time.

265
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:23,740
This is the distributed system literature.

266
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:30,789
Whenever nosed needs to agree on a common
value, we start a consensus algorithm to — there's

267
00:23:30,789 --> 00:23:36,010
usually a leader process that takes care of
making the final decision based on the vote

268
00:23:36,010 --> 00:23:38,399
it was it has received from its peers.

269
00:23:38,399 --> 00:23:44,350
We send messages on a channel, the channel
gets congested, too much traffic, we get bottlenecks,

270
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:50,850
and so on, and end up with partitions, and
the response of the computer — is it dead?

271
00:23:50,850 --> 00:23:55,090
This is all metaphorical language, and there
are more metaphors there than I want to bore

272
00:23:55,090 --> 00:23:56,900
you with.

273
00:23:56,900 --> 00:24:02,570
Yes, when we don't know how to explain something,
we use metaphorical language all the time.

274
00:24:02,570 --> 00:24:09,820
Yes, it is time that we don't talk any more
about master-slave.

275
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:11,120
Take it out.

276
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:15,539
It's very, very easy!

277
00:24:15,539 --> 00:24:16,639
[Applause].

278
00:24:16,639 --> 00:24:19,730
Let's talk about passwords.

279
00:24:19,730 --> 00:24:23,669
You know this one, right?

280
00:24:23,669 --> 00:24:25,429
Containers.

281
00:24:25,429 --> 00:24:28,940
I was wondering why containers picked up so
much?

282
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:34,820
If we think about containers like the actual
physical cache, it is a standard thing that

283
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:38,159
can be shipped anywhere, fits on trains, ships,
and trucks.

284
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:40,920
You can stack and reuse them, and so on.

285
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:47,730
It is a very good language to speak about
this thing I'm trying to build or sell you.

286
00:24:47,730 --> 00:24:53,600
I wonder at some point if people will have
a start-up to recover from shipping containers,

287
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,549
I don't know.

288
00:24:55,549 --> 00:25:00,740
But another password is microservices.

289
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:09,769
When I read this blog post ... isolation collaboration,
small is better, big is cumbersome, David

290
00:25:09,769 --> 00:25:14,580
versus Goliath, whatever, when you read the
next, you say this is Erlang.

291
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:22,950
I don't know if any of you worked in Erlang?

292
00:25:22,950 --> 00:25:27,500
But, I was like, these guys literally stole
everything from he recall Lang and gave them

293
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:33,980
a new name in the very last paragraph on the
footnote, it says, "In another direction,

294
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:38,379
one could argue that microservices are the
same thing as the Erlang model but applied

295
00:25:38,379 --> 00:25:42,909
to an enterprise application context" are
you crying little Erlang boy because I don't

296
00:25:42,909 --> 00:25:43,919
use Erlang?

297
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:48,769
My yes is what it Erlang's elevators' pitch.

298
00:25:48,769 --> 00:25:54,590
These are the metaphors in Erlang: kill children,
you spawn children.

299
00:25:54,590 --> 00:26:00,620
You have supervisors on those children, and
the actor model, what is even the actor model?

300
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:05,010
Imagine trying to sell Erlang with this type
of vocabulary.

301
00:26:05,010 --> 00:26:06,840
Very hard.

302
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:14,860
First, get people to understand things, and
then explain how things actually work.

303
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:21,200
For example, RabbitMQ, a server, also a developer
advocate.

304
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:26,250
When people ask me this question, I say no,
it's not, it's a Q server.

305
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:29,220
A message is a higher attraction than jobs.

306
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:37,909
You can do — it is a job server, yes, understand
rabbit, with that metaphor, and then we can

307
00:26:37,909 --> 00:26:43,070
go deeper to see what it actually is.

308
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:50,230
Conclusion: we need to master the art of metaphor
selection, we need to master the art of meaning

309
00:26:50,230 --> 00:26:59,820
amplification, and, finally, our programme
is a metaphor for the solution we found.

310
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:04,509
If you want references, some of the books
I read, some of the pictures I stole from

311
00:27:04,509 --> 00:27:21,360
the internet.

312
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:22,360
Thank you.

313
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:23,840
[Cheering and Applause].

314
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:29,879
I want to say thanks to the organisers, because
it's not objective that you see a conference

315
00:27:29,879 --> 00:27:35,330
where Latinos are not only serving food, they
are speaking, they are there in the crowd,

316
00:27:35,330 --> 00:27:36,330
so, thanks!
