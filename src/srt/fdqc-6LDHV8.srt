00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:13,139

hey everyone so I'm Alex I'm from the

2
00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:15,870
kendo UI team and i'm here to present to

3
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:20,580
you the kendo UI framework I certainly

4
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:22,920
think that you want to get things done

5
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:24,560
because the other session is about

6
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:27,330
Arduino and QR drones in it's totally

7
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:30,150
awesome and I think that this would be

8
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:34,140
more like getting things done stuff so

9
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:39,899
about can do you I well here's a summary

10
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:42,270
of what I'll talk about so why do we

11
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:45,960
build the kendo UI framework what's

12
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:49,680
currently present in the framework then

13
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,039
we'll do a quick demo of the of some of

14
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:56,940
the features then we'll talk about the

15
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:00,449
future and after that you'll be allowed

16
00:01:00,449 --> 00:01:05,640
to ask questions so why can do you I

17
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:08,909
it's a framework and there's plenty of

18
00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:12,180
them around and you might have noticed

19
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:15,600
that there's one for everything so

20
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,990
here's a quick list of some of randomly

21
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:22,530
chosen very popular frameworks it

22
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:24,930
there's everything like there's a

23
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:28,259
taxonomy of framework of features like

24
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:30,900
there's frameworks about templating in

25
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:34,409
there's quite a lot of them and there

26
00:01:34,409 --> 00:01:37,049
are also components like jQuery UI which

27
00:01:37,049 --> 00:01:40,740
doesn't have a grid and charts and there

28
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:44,189
are different volumes that are providing

29
00:01:44,189 --> 00:01:48,000
such functionality and if you do watch

30
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,810
project and you want all this like

31
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:54,770
template in Cannes UI widgets and

32
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:57,780
charting and grids what do you have to

33
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:00,119
do you have to pull all different

34
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:03,600
versions of these frameworks and there

35
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,670
might be incompatibilities they marked

36
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:08,940
different licensing models there there's

37
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:10,470
quite so

38
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:15,050
few things that might go wrong and that

39
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:20,640
could really burden your work so we have

40
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,810
a non unified framework so there's a

41
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:27,650
framework for all of these features but

42
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:33,150
they are not in the same place we most

43
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:35,130
of these frameworks are written by

44
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:38,550
really smart and talented individuals

45
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:40,830
but they don't really have a roadmap

46
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:46,230
that they fall and now some of them do

47
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:50,010
but most of them don't and of course

48
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:53,430
there's the support part of it so if you

49
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:55,230
want support you have to purchase it

50
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:58,380
most no most commonly from a different

51
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:00,840
company that for example for jQuery UI

52
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:04,020
you have to purchase it the support from

53
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:05,970
my pen tool which is a great company but

54
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:10,850
it's still different a different persons

55
00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:14,090
who are not writing called codes in the

56
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:17,910
jQuery why so if you have a professional

57
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:21,269
project you usually don't want to risk

58
00:03:21,269 --> 00:03:24,300
anything and you don't want to waste

59
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:27,780
your time fixing other people's books in

60
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:31,190
the components so we had a talk about

61
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:35,540
one hour go with the guy he told me

62
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:40,530
we're using that that tree view from a

63
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:43,680
tree view plugin but we had to fix other

64
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,799
people's code in order to get our

65
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:49,790
application going so that's a problem

66
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:55,230
and our intense with Jake with kendo UI

67
00:03:55,230 --> 00:04:00,330
is go from this to this so one framework

68
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:02,340
one unified that contains all the

69
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:06,510
functionality needs about for your next

70
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:09,660
vacation with support and with

71
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:14,010
predictable schedule and let me tell him

72
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:16,470
these things so we haven't missed a

73
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:18,780
release in the last three

74
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:22,680
earth at all so we say it's one release

75
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:26,970
four months that's it we ship another

76
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:29,250
thing to notice telerik the company I

77
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:33,389
work for is worth lira noun for its

78
00:04:33,389 --> 00:04:35,520
support so you get support from

79
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,460
developers of the frameworks that you

80
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:42,840
use you publish about you submit a bug

81
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:46,680
gets fixed and that's 24 hours for so

82
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:51,840
you get it in on the next day most so

83
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,540
let's delve in some technical stuff so

84
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:58,220
what is scandal you I can do I is a

85
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:01,490
framework built on top of jQuery and

86
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:06,960
well we use a lot of html5 features but

87
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:11,130
black attacks but also new JavaScript

88
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:14,850
API is that have come with html5

89
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:18,720
movement and it's also quite a lot of

90
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,229
css3 features so we'll keep the buzzword

91
00:05:22,229 --> 00:05:26,490
bingo let's say and with after all the

92
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:29,460
targets the create a unified framework

93
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:32,460
that contains all this stuff so what are

94
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:34,220
the components of this framework so

95
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:37,650
firstly we have UI widgets there is

96
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:40,530
currently 13 UI widgets and we point out

97
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:45,750
plenty more most notably we have a fully

98
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:49,979
functional grids and a chart right now

99
00:05:49,979 --> 00:05:52,530
we're improving the child support pie

100
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:55,200
chart with our next release which will

101
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:59,160
be next week we also have a data source

102
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:02,610
which abstracts away all the data

103
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:04,650
operations so we have this source that

104
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:08,250
pulls data from XML or remote services

105
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:13,770
or perhaps in the future from down I

106
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:19,289
think and it strikes the sorting the

107
00:06:19,289 --> 00:06:22,470
filtering the grouping of this data for

108
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:24,870
all other parts of the compound

109
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:28,350
of the framework this is single point of

110
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:30,390
failure if you have a problem with your

111
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:34,770
data you know is the date source we also

112
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:37,680
have templates which we spent quite a

113
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,080
lot for which we spent quite a lot of

114
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:43,020
time and just for making them really

115
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:48,810
really fast so let me show that so this

116
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:55,410
is a

117
00:06:55,420 --> 00:07:03,860
that's not visible on the screen it

118
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:10,030
okay they're fast so next what are the

119
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:12,880
benefits of this framework after all we

120
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:16,110
want to hear for unified framework that

121
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:19,240
has less blue code so each component of

122
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,590
the framework knows about the other

123
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:24,280
components and this means that the grid

124
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:27,660
will know about the data source and you

125
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:30,070
simply attach data source to the great

126
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:32,250
you won't have to write any code that

127
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:36,660
merges the two and also the grid can

128
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:40,150
fully understand templates and tempting

129
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:44,470
language it's built for speed which you

130
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:48,430
didn't see but i'll be sure to show you

131
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:52,150
to you at the booth downstairs if you

132
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:54,640
come and visit us it's familiar to

133
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:57,610
jquery dance because our IP eyes are

134
00:07:57,610 --> 00:08:00,700
really close to the jquery development

135
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:04,780
model with chaining and their each

136
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:07,840
widget is simply a plug-in a jquery

137
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:12,820
plugin that can extend your HTML we've

138
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:14,830
gotten aggressive roadmaps already set

139
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:18,610
and they're supported so let's do them

140
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:21,550
the source of the demo is available at

141
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:24,040
give her and that's a short year of that

142
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:32,260
and here it is so that's basic page that

143
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:37,800
uses the candle component so we have a

144
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:41,260
html5 doctype etc we've got to style

145
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:43,420
sheets one that handles all the

146
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:47,140
positioning and layout that's the kind

147
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:50,440
of common CSS and one that handles the

148
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:54,040
teaming of the library so right now we

149
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:58,630
have three different teams but with farm

150
00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:01,480
on improving that situation

151
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:04,130
after that we've got the only dependency

152
00:09:04,130 --> 00:09:08,180
of jQuery and all the components of the

153
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:10,390
framework bundled together in one file

154
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:14,050
and that's it with that you can start

155
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:18,260
writing can do code instead of watching

156
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:29,029
me do that oh wow all the code is tacked

157
00:09:29,029 --> 00:09:32,000
I'm on github so let's get the next

158
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,510
stage it that's the boiler plates that

159
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:39,370
you all right so so we need data source

160
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:43,730
we do a binding to Twitter to the Search

161
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:48,470
API of Twitter so here we have the data

162
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:52,550
source as you can see we instantiate the

163
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:56,990
data source on line 15 it's in the

164
00:09:56,990 --> 00:10:03,500
candidate namespace and it has three not

165
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:06,140
all components unit so we have the

166
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:08,209
transport which is held data travels

167
00:10:08,209 --> 00:10:11,460
between the server and the client

168
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:14,240
secondly the schema which interprets the

169
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,910
results when the data comes from the

170
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:19,760
server and the last one is change event

171
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:24,560
which is all fact everywhere every time

172
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:29,240
that the datasources filtered or sorted

173
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:33,680
or when new data rise to the transport

174
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:37,670
is sports also crud operations but in

175
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:41,630
this case we need only the query Twitter

176
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:44,480
the twitter api so here's the twitter

177
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:49,100
api and we search for the Jays conf you

178
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:54,290
tack scrubs it's working the browser its

179
00:10:54,290 --> 00:10:56,730
I

180
00:10:56,730 --> 00:11:00,790
this nothing actually but the the data

181
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:02,860
is walk to the console because that's

182
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:06,490
what we do in the change event this view

183
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:11,650
is actually the method of the Dead

184
00:11:11,650 --> 00:11:14,380
source that represents update that has

185
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:17,530
come from server so the next step would

186
00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:21,070
be to instantiate the grid that is bound

187
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:24,790
to this dark dead source let's skip that

188
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:31,750
step it's tagged grid and here we have

189
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:34,720
it so we just create the elements and

190
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,000
end it to the body and called the jig

191
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:42,040
the candle grids jquery-ui rj jquery

192
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:45,400
poem as you can see it's knows about

193
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:48,550
dead source and the big source is

194
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:50,800
encapsulated so it's totally detached

195
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:56,860
from the grid and this will enable us to

196
00:11:56,860 --> 00:12:00,370
do one more thing in a few moments but

197
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:03,820
let's keep the grid right now so we have

198
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:07,060
also the common definition we just takes

199
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:09,580
the fields from the date source and

200
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:13,810
shows them in a mind grid so how does

201
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:20,640
this look like oh it's like that fine oh

202
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,480
great

203
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:25,269
oh you can see also the temple thing

204
00:12:25,269 --> 00:12:31,720
yeah we're fastest yeah so we have a

205
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:38,930
grid and oh it's not much

206
00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:42,890
so the next step would be to use

207
00:12:42,890 --> 00:12:46,070
templates in this example so let's get

208
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:56,890
them from git git checkout templates so

209
00:12:56,890 --> 00:13:00,040
as you can see now we have a template

210
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:02,750
specified for this cone which takes the

211
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:05,390
content of the user templates stack and

212
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:08,660
place it in the grid the user template

213
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:11,839
tag is actually unknown execute scripts

214
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:17,120
which contains the following and as you

215
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,459
can see the templates are deeply

216
00:13:19,459 --> 00:13:22,490
integrated in the grid so you have a

217
00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:25,100
tight integration between all components

218
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:27,470
of the framework you don't have to write

219
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:33,110
any code that makes this for you and

220
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:40,079
that would look like this so we have the

221
00:13:40,089 --> 00:13:45,730
afters and links the users in the grid

222
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:49,520
using the template back to our

223
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:55,430
presentation what's next so right now we

224
00:13:55,430 --> 00:14:01,010
have four major points that we want to

225
00:14:01,010 --> 00:14:03,320
implement but currently the framework is

226
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:06,890
in beta and our official releases in

227
00:14:06,890 --> 00:14:10,850
November mid-november hope for the

228
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:14,150
official release these features will be

229
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:18,529
finalized and we also have a better for

230
00:14:18,529 --> 00:14:21,380
new mobile framework Oh can do you I'm

231
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:27,560
mobile what this framework will what our

232
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:30,800
idea of this framework is is that you

233
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,410
can get you'll be able to get a native

234
00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:37,940
looking Qi for each device so when

235
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:40,430
you're you called your application once

236
00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:43,970
and when your users go to the website

237
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:47,180
you've coded if they're using an iphone

238
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:49,370
they'll get an iphone you

239
00:14:49,370 --> 00:14:52,820
why and today use android phone or

240
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:55,100
windows home they'll get the respective

241
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:58,550
styling and look and feel like the

242
00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:02,420
system they're using another thing to

243
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:06,260
notice is I don't have side for that are

244
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:09,140
the models of the dates or so you'll be

245
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:12,529
able to define your business objects in

246
00:15:12,529 --> 00:15:17,930
your eating the scheme of the base

247
00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:20,630
source which will automatically create

248
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:22,760
the objects you need from the dates or

249
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:27,380
so you query a arbitrary service and you

250
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:30,200
redefine what the results are in the

251
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,900
dates or so they'll be transformed to

252
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:38,210
the results you want another thing to

253
00:15:38,210 --> 00:15:42,020
notice is team builder which will enable

254
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:46,540
you to create different teams for the

255
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:52,029
widgets and our idea is to make it like

256
00:15:52,029 --> 00:15:55,910
bookmarklet that can be enabled embedded

257
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:58,850
in your page while you're developing it

258
00:15:58,850 --> 00:16:02,150
so that you can pass the colors and all

259
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:08,240
the shiny stuff and get CSS of what your

260
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:13,430
team will be so that's it for me

261
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:16,070
download your better today I urge you to

262
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:17,900
the soul you can share your feedback on

263
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:21,190
user voice and will be there to listen

264
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:24,140
if you have any questions feel free to

265
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:26,959
ask them right now on twitter or at the

266
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:36,340
booth which is downstairs

267
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:49,820
so any questions yes let's see that I'm

268
00:16:49,820 --> 00:17:02,240
not really sure actually

269
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:10,709
was it whole or a mmm oh yeah so can do

270
00:17:10,709 --> 00:17:17,490
all right now is 250 q bites yeah and

271
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:20,069
that's all the framework so that's the

272
00:17:20,069 --> 00:17:24,990
chart etc we plan on creating a way to

273
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:27,390
specify which components you need and

274
00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:30,330
bundle it up but much like most

275
00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:37,899
frameworks out there yes

276
00:17:37,909 --> 00:17:41,039
take the source wouldn't one thing I was

277
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:52,020
missing was something like

278
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:56,060
so the question is models are we going

279
00:17:56,060 --> 00:18:11,890
to use models and also want some kind of

280
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:25,500
mapping never make sure that the same

281
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:33,000
but funny sorry

282
00:18:33,010 --> 00:18:43,129
regis data

283
00:18:43,139 --> 00:18:57,880
the same i see i see so so did conflicts

284
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:01,120
like resolution so yeah and falling well

285
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:04,450
i'm not the one who works on that so i'm

286
00:19:04,450 --> 00:19:07,990
not really sure about that but i know

287
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:10,740
that two of our team members are

288
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:16,120
constantly working on some resolution of

289
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:18,340
such conflicts when you for example when

290
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:20,860
you edit data that the data is

291
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:23,590
consistent between surround one so but

292
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:27,669
it's pretty magical for me so yeah have

293
00:19:27,669 --> 00:19:36,860
no idea how oh yes

294
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:39,730
so the question is what at what time we

295
00:19:39,730 --> 00:19:42,030
want to release the mobile version so

296
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:47,950
our schedule is usually some in

297
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:50,140
mid-november there will be a beta

298
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:54,040
version of the mobile yes with the final

299
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:56,710
version of kendo UI there will be a beta

300
00:19:56,710 --> 00:20:01,130
version of the kendo UI mobile and

301
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:04,390
usually four months after that worship

302
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:07,120
official version it could be faster it

303
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:12,429
but it depends on and we could ship it

304
00:20:12,429 --> 00:20:16,630
earlier so at most it's four months from

305
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:23,470
November that's much so mid-march other

306
00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:28,070
questions yes

307
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:32,370
yeah so the candy aisle is open source

308
00:20:32,370 --> 00:20:38,140
it's dou Y sins under GPL three and if

309
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:39,460
you purchase the commercial license

310
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:41,679
that's soft so you can do whatever you

311
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:45,490
want with the commercial license so you

312
00:20:45,490 --> 00:20:49,770
can download the source code from the

313
00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:53,050
link that isn't there ah yeah is there

314
00:20:53,050 --> 00:20:57,730
no it's not yeah the from candy i dot

315
00:20:57,730 --> 00:20:59,860
com so what can do you I dot-com you

316
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:01,660
click download better and you get the

317
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:11,260
source code and the examples yes

318
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:18,950
I

319
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:29,530
I'm sorry could you start again yes yes

320
00:21:29,530 --> 00:21:32,950
we we have on this and we're currently

321
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:35,650
not have not started yet but I think

322
00:21:35,650 --> 00:21:40,780
this is really close so we'll definitely

323
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:44,110
do that yeah what the defense well right

324
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:47,490
now you have a list of dependencies that

325
00:21:47,490 --> 00:21:50,080
it's just in the documentation which

326
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:53,350
components are depend on which parts of

327
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:55,780
the point in the framework but we'll do

328
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:57,460
that automatically so that you can

329
00:21:57,460 --> 00:22:06,720
bundle it and modify it yes

330
00:22:06,730 --> 00:22:11,000
it's not yet announced so I counter it

331
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,840
I'm not the one who inside that and it

332
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:16,760
will be definitely published with the

333
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:20,780
official version of the okay yeah myth

334
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:27,730
number from the official can say other

335
00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:37,810
questions yes

336
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:47,370
like

337
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:50,510
so the question is whether it is easy to

338
00:22:50,510 --> 00:22:54,530
substitute the templating engine all

339
00:22:54,530 --> 00:23:01,730
right now it's not I guess but we could

340
00:23:01,730 --> 00:23:04,809
think something of that so yeah

341
00:23:04,809 --> 00:23:07,190
shouldn't we wanted to do that because

342
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:22,980
the templates are really fast

343
00:23:22,990 --> 00:23:24,620
Oh

344
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:28,460
aha well especially for that for the

345
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:31,100
simplified whoops and special syntax up

346
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:33,680
oops we're thinking about that too so

347
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:37,210
web I think mustache has on each

348
00:23:37,210 --> 00:23:40,550
construct that its rights over items yet

349
00:23:40,550 --> 00:23:52,070
we're thinking about that oh yeah I you

350
00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:54,800
definitely can use mustache but our

351
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:57,679
other tempting lounges but I'm not sure

352
00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:02,960
right now how easy it is oh yeah but

353
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:09,289
we're thinking about other questions
