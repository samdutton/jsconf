1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,550

Oh

2
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:08,029
so this talk is called all this useless

3
00:00:08,029 --> 00:00:12,019
beauty and it's about surreal numbers in

4
00:00:12,019 --> 00:00:14,030
JavaScript so it's kind of a tricky

5
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:15,679
topic and it's not particularly useful

6
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:17,780
it's nice to get this over with so we

7
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:19,519
can get on with actual useful stuff that

8
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:20,779
will make you better developers for the

9
00:00:20,779 --> 00:00:23,960
rest of the day yeah as John mentioned

10
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:26,480
I'm a teacher so this is the kind of

11
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:27,560
thing I try and get my students

12
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:28,849
interested in rather than just how to

13
00:00:28,849 --> 00:00:32,300
make money doing web stuff I'm not

14
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:33,770
really a social media kind of guy but

15
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:35,930
you can find me on snapchat my username

16
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:39,559
is crud head and I'm also called head on

17
00:00:39,559 --> 00:00:41,480
IRC if any of you ever run into me that

18
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:45,379
and I'm from Sydney so these slides

19
00:00:45,379 --> 00:00:47,390
obviously this is just the plug for my

20
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:50,270
sponsor here this is revealed j/s it

21
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:52,039
doesn't look like usual reveal jazz but

22
00:00:52,039 --> 00:00:53,000
I don't want you to think that I

23
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,890
actually have design skills I've

24
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:57,079
actually ripped this design off from jen

25
00:00:57,079 --> 00:00:59,210
Schiffer I haven't even renamed the

26
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:01,940
files its source to references to jquery

27
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:04,420
conference in austin texas of last year

28
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:06,860
but I met her last year and she's

29
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:08,840
wonderful she talks about the same kinds

30
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:10,820
of things except her stuff is much more

31
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:13,670
beautiful obviously and I'd encourage

32
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:16,450
you to go and look up some of her talks

33
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:18,770
what I have added to this is my own

34
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:20,240
picture here which is Harvey Birdman

35
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,610
there was a complaint from some people

36
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:23,960
that I didn't include enough pictures in

37
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:26,329
my slides so I put Harvey Birdman on

38
00:01:26,329 --> 00:01:29,000
every single page there and if you get

39
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,920
bored you can just look a Harvey Birdman

40
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,420
I like to think that he's kind of

41
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:34,790
looking at my slides and quietly

42
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:36,649
approving of them so he got to slide to

43
00:01:36,649 --> 00:01:39,860
himself there this presentation contains

44
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:42,229
one animated gif I know that you young

45
00:01:42,229 --> 00:01:44,270
developing people like animated gifts so

46
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:45,740
I've got one in here it's not a funny

47
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:47,659
one but if you're a fan of animated gifs

48
00:01:47,659 --> 00:01:51,260
you can look forward to that

49
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:53,950
so where do I come from I'm not famous

50
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:55,750
I'm just one of the regular kind of guys

51
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:58,030
that r is interested in web stuff I

52
00:01:58,030 --> 00:02:00,790
haven't ever done anything famous I'm

53
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:03,250
much older than all of you at least

54
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:05,590
spiritually so I was doing this stuff

55
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:07,660
last century before most of your born

56
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:10,470
before nine eleven I like to think of it

57
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:13,450
and I was making the internet and it was

58
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:15,880
all going fine and then I'd know exactly

59
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,110
sure what happened but something called

60
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:20,830
the dot-com collapsed and lots of people

61
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:23,080
didn't have work for a while so I went

62
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,580
to university and I thought I'll study

63
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:26,200
mathematics that's got something to do

64
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,840
with computers probably and that stuff's

65
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:31,030
really hard and don't don't study

66
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:32,980
mathematics don't let your children do

67
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:36,690
it I really regret having done that I

68
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:38,920
discovered it there towards the end of

69
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:41,590
my seven-year failing first you mats for

70
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:45,220
x degree that jQuery is quite fun so

71
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:46,630
Java scripts not my favorite language

72
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:49,330
you can beat me up for that later but

73
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:51,550
I'd really like the community I like the

74
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:53,260
community I like JavaScript because of

75
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:54,580
you people that come to things like this

76
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:58,030
I like the jQuery IRC channel I like

77
00:02:58,030 --> 00:02:59,530
jQuery because it makes it easy for

78
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:01,090
people to do cool stuff that they're

79
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:03,310
excited about so that got me back into

80
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:06,910
the web and I ended up teaching so I

81
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:08,290
worked for a number of years doing that

82
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:09,820
and it turned out it's easier to teach

83
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:12,550
people if you can speak easy to teach

84
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:13,720
and actually make things because I

85
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,220
didn't have deadlines my students come

86
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:16,600
to me they say the projects due on

87
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,400
Friday I'm not gonna get this finished

88
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,590
and it's not my problem I just say good

89
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:23,860
luck with that

90
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:26,069
so what I learned at University this is

91
00:03:26,069 --> 00:03:28,560
a you know a brief summary maths is

92
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,569
really hard and it's very impressive

93
00:03:30,569 --> 00:03:31,980
that some people are good at it I'm not

94
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:33,930
one of those people I especially hate

95
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:36,060
calculus I didn't realize those going to

96
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:37,020
be so much I should have seen that

97
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:39,300
coming but it's just one of those things

98
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:43,380
I especially hate infinitesimals so I

99
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:46,110
side with Bishop Berkeley when calculus

100
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:47,880
was kind of invented or discovered we'll

101
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,100
talk a bit more about that in a moment

102
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:51,420
he wrote a letter complaining that

103
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:54,450
infinitesimals were offensive to God so

104
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:56,640
you guys know with the area under a

105
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,470
curve you can work it out by taking an

106
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:00,360
infinite number of infinitely small

107
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,250
things and they add up to the area under

108
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:04,410
the curve that makes me feel icky I

109
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:06,360
really don't like that it doesn't make

110
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,760
sense I know it works i'm happy that it

111
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,350
works but i don't i don't want to have

112
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:11,970
anything to do with it so I'm with

113
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:15,000
Berkeley that that is horrible and it

114
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,290
turns out what I should have studied is

115
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:18,090
these fields called the philosophy of

116
00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:20,489
mathematics and or meta mathematics so

117
00:04:20,489 --> 00:04:21,750
that's the stuff about how math works

118
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:23,310
rather than actually having to deal with

119
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:27,780
the nitty gritty details so the kinds of

120
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:28,950
questions you get to talk about in the

121
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:31,050
philosophy of mathematics do numbers

122
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:35,280
exist is mathematics invented or

123
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,960
discovered would we have mathematics if

124
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:40,560
we didn't have people how do written

125
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,520
symbols capture mathematical truths what

126
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:47,190
the hell is truth I took too long

127
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:49,200
courses on what truth is I still don't

128
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,430
know but it's it's an interesting

129
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:53,789
question more relevant is how well do

130
00:04:53,789 --> 00:04:55,289
computers model mathematics and we'll

131
00:04:55,289 --> 00:04:57,440
talk about that in a little bit and

132
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,370
questions like how does girdles

133
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:01,140
incompleteness theorem affect our daily

134
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:02,850
lives I'm not sure that it does but it's

135
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:06,060
fun to think about so what I try to

136
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:08,160
teach what I'm teaching three months at

137
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,520
a time of a full-stack web development

138
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,110
bootcamp kind of thing that's all the

139
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:15,270
rage these days so I teach people how to

140
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:17,340
make web stuff the full stack as they

141
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:20,400
say and you know my motivation is that

142
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,870
I'm trying to hire I'm trying to teach

143
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:23,310
people to have the kinds of skills that

144
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:24,720
I would hire them for so if they showed

145
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,370
up on day 1 i'd be able to give them

146
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:28,650
something to do and they be able to do

147
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:30,659
something useful for me but beyond that

148
00:05:30,659 --> 00:05:32,099
i take it as an opportunity to teach

149
00:05:32,099 --> 00:05:33,330
people about the joy of programming

150
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:34,830
because i really love this stuff i just

151
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:35,160
got into

152
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,780
computers when as a kid and I've never

153
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:38,430
really had a wobble about what I do with

154
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:40,710
my career that's just worked out well

155
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:41,790
for me so I try and teach them stuff

156
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:43,440
that like this isn't anything to do with

157
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:47,820
money this is just interesting or fun so

158
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:49,110
the things that I insist that they

159
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:50,490
should know the things I say when you

160
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:51,780
have some spare time this is what you

161
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:53,160
should go and look up I think they

162
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,960
should learn formal logic I think there

163
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,610
is not enough emphasis on formal logic

164
00:05:56,610 --> 00:05:58,770
in computer science courses and I think

165
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:00,390
it makes us stronger developers it makes

166
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:02,850
development more easily if you're able

167
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:04,590
to understand reasoning that kind of

168
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:06,480
abstract thought and I also think you

169
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,830
should learn regular expressions because

170
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:09,060
everyone should learn regular

171
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:10,740
expressions I mean obviously especially

172
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:12,570
developers but I'm often shocked to

173
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:14,400
discover that people who are senior to

174
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,140
me in companies don't know regular

175
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:17,640
expressions and come to me for help with

176
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:18,780
what the hell is matter with you people

177
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:21,210
these things will save you time so you

178
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:22,380
know I tell my students you need to

179
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:24,870
learn regular expressions why I think

180
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:27,660
formal logic matters in computing so you

181
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:29,790
guys know about cheering machines um you

182
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:31,350
don't have to know how to make them but

183
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:33,420
you know that what they are the idea was

184
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:34,890
you know ensuring invented this who's

185
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:36,900
like how would I automate the process as

186
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:38,220
I go through when I'm trying to think of

187
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:40,680
some think through some problem so it's

188
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:43,070
like a machine that does the job that a

189
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:45,150
mathematician or a logicians brain would

190
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:48,180
do so Turing machines are basically

191
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:50,220
mechanical reasons they can do reasoning

192
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:52,740
mechanically for you and computers that

193
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:54,330
we use today are practical cheering

194
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:55,919
machines we kind of we wouldn't have

195
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:58,200
computers in this state if we hadn't had

196
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:00,410
the concept of a Turing machine first

197
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:02,850
computers are also formal systems so if

198
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:04,200
you're able to think about formal logic

199
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,910
and formal systems then that gives you a

200
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:07,410
sense of what your computer is doing and

201
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:09,480
I like to think that a computer is a

202
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,700
tiny frantic robot logician trapped

203
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:14,070
inside these machines so if you think of

204
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:15,419
them in those terms it's easier to push

205
00:07:15,419 --> 00:07:19,980
them around so this is about two real

206
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:21,090
numbers but I'll give you a little bit

207
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:22,650
of context for this numbers is really

208
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:25,260
strange and children understand this you

209
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:26,340
forget about it because you just get

210
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:27,600
used to them you can pay your bus fare

211
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,790
or pay your rent each month or whatever

212
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:31,590
else needs to do but when you explain

213
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:32,790
what numbers are the children they

214
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:34,140
understand that numbers are quite

215
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:35,970
strange and I like to encourage people

216
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:37,290
to go back to think about this and kind

217
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:39,330
of be weirded out by numbers so for

218
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:41,490
example does the number seven exist and

219
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:44,370
if so where is it is the number seven in

220
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:46,350
this room somewhere with the number

221
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:48,900
seven exist if people didn't exist

222
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:50,430
hand on the physical universe in some

223
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:52,530
way it's an interesting but you know

224
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:54,210
obviously we can use the number seven

225
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:55,440
and whether or not we believe in it it's

226
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,580
not an important question but it's an

227
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:58,740
interesting one where did the number

228
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:00,720
come from where is it going what does it

229
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,600
want we're actually relying on numbers

230
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,520
but we don't really know what they are

231
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,800
and I mean I've thought about this a lot

232
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,259
and I still don't know what they are and

233
00:08:09,259 --> 00:08:11,880
most mathematicians it turns out don't

234
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,199
want to talk about this they just want

235
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:15,120
to get on with it they ask you to stop

236
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,680
asking questions and please leave the

237
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:20,880
university but if you're if you're in

238
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,800
the philosophy department they will

239
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,090
agree with you that foundations of

240
00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:26,910
mathematics are still uncertain so

241
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:28,470
there's quote from John von Neumann he

242
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:30,060
of the von Neumann architecture which

243
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:32,580
are machines today using mathematics you

244
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:34,320
don't understand things you just get

245
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,789
used to them and that's really true we

246
00:08:35,789 --> 00:08:37,380
just get used to mathematics we kind of

247
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:40,140
ignore how weird it all is so let's

248
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:44,039
consider the number 144 in decimal

249
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:45,570
that's expressed with one and a four and

250
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:47,940
four that's what it looks like in binary

251
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:49,260
and that's the JavaScript version

252
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:50,700
because JavaScript doesn't want to do

253
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:54,000
binary as a literal that's the octal

254
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,529
version and that's the hexadecimal

255
00:08:55,529 --> 00:08:58,589
version so these things all represent

256
00:08:58,589 --> 00:09:00,420
the number that we call in decimal or

257
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:03,900
base 10 144 but they're not the actual

258
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:05,339
number ok go to keep that in mind

259
00:09:05,339 --> 00:09:06,779
they're just different representations

260
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:08,760
of this thing whatever it is wherever it

261
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:11,430
is the number 144 and these basically

262
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:13,200
just symbols which behave like the

263
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,640
number they do the things that we expect

264
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,890
the number 144 to dirt it's greater than

265
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:20,450
100 it's divisible by 2 and so on so

266
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:23,430
numbers in JavaScript I put some

267
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:24,510
JavaScript in here because that's why

268
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:25,950
you guys are here so it seemed like the

269
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:29,430
right thing to do programs generally

270
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:31,050
model numbers as collections of ones and

271
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:32,760
zeros so you know that computers really

272
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,610
binary that's what they're insured and

273
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:37,640
JavaScript as you know uses the I eeee

274
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,839
754 double precision binary

275
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:42,450
floating-point format which gives us

276
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:43,890
most of the values we care about so we

277
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:45,540
can count lots and lots of integers and

278
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:47,430
we get some rough approximation of a

279
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:50,160
bunch of decimals so in JavaScript this

280
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,290
is what 144 looks like in the computer's

281
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:54,450
memory at 64 bits and there's a couple

282
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:55,589
little ones in there and then a whole

283
00:09:55,589 --> 00:09:59,130
bunch of zeros and there's some problems

284
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:00,209
with this which are fairly famous

285
00:10:00,209 --> 00:10:01,470
problems you will have heard about these

286
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:02,400
so we have

287
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,230
Robbins with overflow and underflow and

288
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:06,230
precision so to give you some examples

289
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:08,730
in JavaScript this is the biggest number

290
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:10,440
you can talk about or think about just

291
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,090
using native JavaScript so you can

292
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:14,430
access number max value tell you what

293
00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:16,260
the biggest number is and that's it and

294
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:18,030
it's a huge number but if you ever

295
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:19,770
needed a bigger number you can't do it

296
00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:22,560
in JavaScript we also have this problem

297
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,880
this is the integers if you're just

298
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,650
counting integers as soon as you get up

299
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:28,200
to this big old number here and add one

300
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,730
to it you just get the same number back

301
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:32,490
which is not a great thing for a

302
00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:35,960
language that's doing mathematics to do

303
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:38,280
that shouldn't be true but it is in

304
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:40,560
JavaScript you'll also have heard about

305
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,390
this one point two plus point one

306
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:44,280
doesn't give you point three gives you a

307
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:48,940
point three and a little tiny bit extra

308
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:52,800
so I e75 for is an imperfect model you

309
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,900
can do a bunch of mathematics but you

310
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:59,520
can't do all that but it's of Isis so

311
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:01,050
can we model numbers in a different way

312
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:04,200
and it turns out that yes we can so

313
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,060
let's talk about sets this is a terrible

314
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:08,490
pun and I'm sorry for that fortunately

315
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:09,480
you're too young to know what I'm

316
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:12,750
talking about so I've stolen Wikipedia

317
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:14,370
definition of what a set is here they're

318
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:16,830
very easy to understand in mathematics a

319
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:18,720
set is a collection of distinct objects

320
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,970
considered as an object in its own right

321
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:22,980
so we say that there's a thing as a set

322
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:25,560
it's a collection of things so sets

323
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,540
usually delimited with curly braces like

324
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:31,200
that and for example here's the set of

325
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,090
positive primes less than 10 so that's

326
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:35,100
two three five and seven to find how to

327
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:37,140
put the numbers into the set and then

328
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:38,670
I've actually gone ahead and drop them

329
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:41,820
straight in there so here's some

330
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:44,370
interesting sets that doesn't just have

331
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:45,990
to be math related so there's the set of

332
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:47,580
people in this room right at this moment

333
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:49,860
that's a valid set that's a thing you

334
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:51,390
can talk about you can think about you

335
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:53,460
can reason about it there's the set of

336
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:56,640
Paul Irish there's the set of odd

337
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,680
integers and that's an infinite set as

338
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:00,930
infinitely many audiences and you can

339
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:02,160
still put them in a set you can have

340
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:05,070
infinite sets that's fine there's a set

341
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:07,830
of things that don't exist which is also

342
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:09,510
an infinite set and it's a very big one

343
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:11,160
and I quite like thinking about it the

344
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,750
set of things that don't exist seems to

345
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:15,270
be much much much bigger than the set of

346
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:18,210
things that do exist

347
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:20,930
and you can have the set of odd numbers

348
00:12:20,930 --> 00:12:23,450
and a set of sorry the set of the set of

349
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:25,070
odd numbers and the set of even numbers

350
00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:27,380
so sets can contain other sets that's

351
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:31,970
not a problem either and we've got this

352
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:34,250
concept called cardinality so the

353
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:37,130
cardinality of a set s is the number of

354
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:39,410
members of s so for example if we have a

355
00:12:39,410 --> 00:12:41,360
set B which has three colors in it blue

356
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,550
white and red then the cardinality of

357
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:45,560
that set is three this is easy right

358
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,360
this you can teach this stuff to primary

359
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,910
school kids so cardinality the

360
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:51,470
interesting thing about it why I care

361
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:52,790
about it is because we can use it as a

362
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:54,590
source for natural numbers and so it's a

363
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:56,480
way of generating natural numbers it's a

364
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,270
place where numbers can be derived from

365
00:12:58,270 --> 00:13:01,370
so the number seven for example you can

366
00:13:01,370 --> 00:13:03,470
say that that is the cardinality of all

367
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:05,900
sets with seven members so if we want to

368
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:07,400
say does the number seven exist we can

369
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,170
say sure you just take all of the sets

370
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:11,300
that have exactly seven members and it's

371
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:13,100
the cardinality of those sets it's the

372
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:16,370
number of things in them and so here's

373
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:18,380
some headache-inducing sets so I'm just

374
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:20,120
focus on Harvey Birdman if this is too

375
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:22,340
much for you these ones are the tricky

376
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:24,860
ones that keep people awake at night so

377
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:27,410
we have this set of all sets that is a

378
00:13:27,410 --> 00:13:30,080
big old set and an interesting property

379
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,940
of the set of all sets is that it

380
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:34,370
includes itself right because it's also

381
00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:40,610
a set we have also the set of all sets

382
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:43,730
that include themselves which is another

383
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:45,020
one's that they'll make your brain hurt

384
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:47,090
so the set of all sets does include

385
00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:49,190
itself so it's included in the set of

386
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:51,850
all sets that include themselves and

387
00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:54,770
Russell's paradox the set of all sets

388
00:13:54,770 --> 00:13:57,710
that don't include themselves so for

389
00:13:57,710 --> 00:13:59,780
example the set of Paul Irish doesn't

390
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:01,040
include itself it's just got

391
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,360
polarization and it doesn't have any

392
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:05,420
other sets in it does Russell's set

393
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:07,850
include itself so does the set of all

394
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:09,800
sets that don't include themselves

395
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:12,410
include itself or not and the answer is

396
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:15,230
yes and not because as soon as it

397
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:17,030
includes itself you need to remove it

398
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:18,650
from the set but as soon as you remove

399
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:20,180
it you need to put it back into the set

400
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:22,520
so this bar Bertrand Russell was trying

401
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:23,990
to establish that mathematics worked

402
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:25,970
really well and had a solid basis in set

403
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:28,760
theory and then this burned him are you

404
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,140
kind of had a breakdown about this

405
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:31,640
because you found this set that you just

406
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:33,110
couldn't really deal with in a nice way

407
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:35,330
so there's paradoxes of the heart of set

408
00:14:35,330 --> 00:14:37,930
theory you just can't get away from that

409
00:14:37,930 --> 00:14:39,890
so now we're going to deal with a much

410
00:14:39,890 --> 00:14:41,990
nicer set one that's much easier to

411
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:45,380
think about is the empty set so all the

412
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:46,820
sets that we've talked about so far have

413
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:49,100
relied on external objects we needed

414
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:51,110
things elsewhere in the world or in the

415
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:53,450
platonic realm or something to put into

416
00:14:53,450 --> 00:14:55,850
the sets so it's likely people in this

417
00:14:55,850 --> 00:14:57,710
room that's we were relying on notice to

418
00:14:57,710 --> 00:15:00,440
define what that set was but there's an

419
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:02,300
interesting set with no members and it

420
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:04,670
doesn't rely on anything and that's

421
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:06,290
called the empty set so that's just the

422
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:09,130
true curlies with nothing inside of it

423
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:11,600
so we can derive this set in various

424
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,030
ways it's easy to show people that the

425
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:16,700
empty set exists the set of porsches the

426
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:20,050
iron ore will ever learn is an empty set

427
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:23,000
the set of numbers that is less than 10

428
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,590
and greater than 20 obviously there's no

429
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:26,510
number that is both less than 10 and

430
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:28,850
greater than 20 so that is also an empty

431
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:30,680
set and we just think of that as being

432
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,390
the empty set in all of these cases it's

433
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:34,340
the same set its the empty set is set

434
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:37,640
with nothing in it we can use the empty

435
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:39,110
set to produce numbers that's why

436
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:40,850
mathematicians and logicians like it

437
00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:42,440
they can use the empty set as a basis

438
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:45,440
for mathematics so they can derive the

439
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,780
number three from the cardinality of the

440
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:50,270
set with 3m avec with three empty sets

441
00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:52,730
inside of it so there's a set inside it

442
00:15:52,730 --> 00:15:54,980
has three empty sets I can produce the

443
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:56,270
number three I can say well obviously

444
00:15:56,270 --> 00:15:58,310
the number three exists because it's the

445
00:15:58,310 --> 00:16:00,110
cardinality of this set and doesn't

446
00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:01,430
depend on anything else so you need to

447
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:03,470
say is that sets exist and the empty set

448
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:05,360
exists and we can get the number three

449
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:09,470
out of it so several formalization of

450
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:11,450
the foundations of mathematics proofs

451
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:12,860
that mathematics has a rigorous

452
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:14,510
foundation we're actually talking about

453
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:16,850
something and not just hallucinating you

454
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:18,770
can use this as a way of doing it and

455
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:20,930
it's it lots of different formalization

456
00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:23,600
have done that so the thrill numbers I'm

457
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,790
about to finally talk about are using

458
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:28,190
this idea they're using a variation of

459
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:31,340
this idea so we'll get on to those so

460
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:32,630
surreal numbers they're not actually

461
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:34,550
useful nobody would ever do this in real

462
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:36,320
life and I did it in real life and I

463
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,970
kind of regret it but I get to talk to

464
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:39,920
you about it now it's from these this

465
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,080
area of recreational mathematics which

466
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,760
is also called armchair mathematics

467
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:47,480
or our mathematical games and Douglas

468
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:49,220
Hofstadter called it meta magical femurs

469
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:52,070
which for anagram fans is an anagram of

470
00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:55,190
mathematical games so that it's implicit

471
00:16:55,190 --> 00:16:56,510
in here that is not of any particular

472
00:16:56,510 --> 00:16:58,280
use it's just interesting to think about

473
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:02,030
and surreal numbers were invented by

474
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:05,209
John Conway and I picked this picture of

475
00:17:05,209 --> 00:17:06,620
him because he looks quite depraved in

476
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:09,980
there I kind of like that about him and

477
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:12,949
Harvey Birdman likes it too you will

478
00:17:12,949 --> 00:17:14,270
have heard of Conway because you'll have

479
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:16,339
heard of Conway's Game of Life and this

480
00:17:16,339 --> 00:17:17,870
is not JavaScript this is actually an

481
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:20,209
animated gif so I'll leave that one for

482
00:17:20,209 --> 00:17:21,980
a second for you to enjoy but obviously

483
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:23,990
Conway is a time waster right he's

484
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:25,610
interested in the game of life which has

485
00:17:25,610 --> 00:17:28,040
no real practical usage and he's

486
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:29,420
interested in serial numbers so that

487
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:31,400
that's kind of his his schtick is like

488
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,750
things that are interesting but don't

489
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:36,140
matter I first heard about us real

490
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:38,390
numbers from Donald Knuth which makes it

491
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:39,830
sound like I know him personally I've

492
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:42,170
never met the guy but he's written a

493
00:17:42,170 --> 00:17:45,140
book about it he's known as the author

494
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:47,240
of the art of computer programming which

495
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:49,190
I told my students to read because it's

496
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:50,960
currently five volumes long and about

497
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,360
this wide and no mother get to the

498
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,910
bottom of it Bill Gates once said that

499
00:17:55,910 --> 00:17:57,320
if anybody had actually read the whole

500
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:58,730
thing they should apply to him directly

501
00:17:58,730 --> 00:18:00,470
for a job I don't know if he still says

502
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:03,770
that but he did but Donald truth also

503
00:18:03,770 --> 00:18:05,390
wrote this book surreal numbers and I

504
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:06,620
don't remember how I first heard about

505
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:07,760
this book because I didn't know there's

506
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,080
going to be a big deal to me so I didn't

507
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:11,570
make a note of it he wrote this book in

508
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:13,910
the 70s and you'll see how 70s is in

509
00:18:13,910 --> 00:18:17,150
when I show you the subtitle how to X

510
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:19,370
students turned on to pure mathematics

511
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:22,310
and found total happiness which is very

512
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:24,470
70s they also enjoy the cover which I

513
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:26,930
believe his wife true that's two people

514
00:18:26,930 --> 00:18:28,910
sitting on a beach having a chat about

515
00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:31,010
surreal numbers and those that that

516
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:32,840
particular color scheme is also very

517
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:38,330
very 70s it's not a good book it's it's

518
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:40,100
not a bit it's not written as a textbook

519
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:41,690
the whole thing is written as a dialogue

520
00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:44,420
between these two starstruck lovers

521
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:45,830
sitting on this beach somewhere on the

522
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:48,020
coast and there are they just invent

523
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:49,610
surreal numbers or discovers real

524
00:18:49,610 --> 00:18:52,010
numbers as something to do it's

525
00:18:52,010 --> 00:18:53,030
interesting if you're interested in

526
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:54,500
serial numbers but I wouldn't go to it

527
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,730
if you're looking at putting on a play

528
00:18:55,730 --> 00:18:57,530
for your local theater company

529
00:18:57,530 --> 00:19:01,520
something like that so surreal numbers

530
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:04,130
this is how they work so your numbers

531
00:19:04,130 --> 00:19:06,080
are made up of sets of other sets so

532
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,640
surreal number is a set with some other

533
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:10,850
sets inside of it and we make new

534
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:12,680
numbers by taking existing numbers when

535
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,630
putting those in new sets and in a

536
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:15,740
second you'll see how horrible the

537
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:17,900
syntax for this is the notation but you

538
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:18,890
should be able to get the idea of how it

539
00:19:18,890 --> 00:19:21,560
works so each set has two members what

540
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:23,840
we call a left and a right so this is

541
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,040
what it looks like this is the template

542
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:27,050
for a surreal number it's a set with two

543
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:29,330
spaces in two slots in it into which

544
00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:31,910
we're going to insert other sets while

545
00:19:31,910 --> 00:19:35,480
this real numbers so to get things

546
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,770
started you have to define the first

547
00:19:36,770 --> 00:19:38,000
serial number and this is what it looks

548
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,710
like it's that's the number zero and

549
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:42,080
it's a set with two empty sets inside of

550
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,520
it so the left part of it is an empty

551
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,140
set and the right part of it is also an

552
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:47,330
empty set so that's a given that's it

553
00:19:47,330 --> 00:19:49,250
and an axiom of the system once you've

554
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:50,480
got that we can make everything else

555
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:53,630
work so this is the number one what we

556
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:56,360
do is we put in the left-hand slot we

557
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:58,190
put the number 0 which we defined

558
00:19:58,190 --> 00:19:59,960
earlier I've marked it in blue there so

559
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,340
you can see that it's just that same

560
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:03,380
symbol again and the right-hand side is

561
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:05,450
just the empty set and make it a little

562
00:20:05,450 --> 00:20:06,950
bit more readable we usually write it in

563
00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:08,510
that way we write the number 0 meaning

564
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:11,390
the real number which represents 0 which

565
00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:12,860
we've already defined that goes in the

566
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:16,180
left slot and the empty set in the right

567
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:19,010
we also got minus 1 which we do the same

568
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:20,390
thing we put it into the right slot

569
00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:21,860
rather than the left slot so here the

570
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:23,810
left slot has the empty set in it and

571
00:20:23,810 --> 00:20:25,520
the right slot has the number 0 which

572
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:29,210
looks like that and then this is where

573
00:20:29,210 --> 00:20:30,770
you can see how it starts to get hideous

574
00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:33,320
this is the number two where we take the

575
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:35,270
existing number one and put that into

576
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:36,890
the left slot and we leave the right

577
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:38,210
slow to learn so it still has the empty

578
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:39,950
set and marked in blue in the middle

579
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:41,330
there you can still see the original

580
00:20:41,330 --> 00:20:44,240
zero so we have a zero and that's used

581
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,920
to produce one which then is used to

582
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:48,290
produce it too and you would write that

583
00:20:48,290 --> 00:20:49,820
in that syntax you'd say the number that

584
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:51,710
represents one sets that represent one

585
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:53,240
going the left slot and the empty set on

586
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:55,700
the right and minus two we do the same

587
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:57,620
thing I left the left set alone and I

588
00:20:57,620 --> 00:20:59,180
put the number minus one in the

589
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:02,180
right-hand set is that all perfectly

590
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:04,919
clear haha

591
00:21:04,919 --> 00:21:06,999
so you can also use this to produce

592
00:21:06,999 --> 00:21:10,059
fractions so the fraction here we take

593
00:21:10,059 --> 00:21:11,499
the number zero put that in the left

594
00:21:11,499 --> 00:21:13,209
slot and the number one goes in the

595
00:21:13,209 --> 00:21:15,969
right spot you can produce a quarto by

596
00:21:15,969 --> 00:21:17,619
taking the half and sticking that in the

597
00:21:17,619 --> 00:21:19,569
right-hand side and you can produce an

598
00:21:19,569 --> 00:21:21,309
eight by taking a quarter and putting

599
00:21:21,309 --> 00:21:22,749
that in the right hand side and so on

600
00:21:22,749 --> 00:21:23,979
and you can keep doing that to get

601
00:21:23,979 --> 00:21:28,179
successive powers of two so if you do

602
00:21:28,179 --> 00:21:29,769
this forever what you actually produce

603
00:21:29,769 --> 00:21:31,690
and people who are much smarter than me

604
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:33,309
have proved that this is correct you can

605
00:21:33,309 --> 00:21:35,079
get the entire continuum of real numbers

606
00:21:35,079 --> 00:21:36,549
so that means all of the numbers that

607
00:21:36,549 --> 00:21:38,259
we're familiar with the real numbers are

608
00:21:38,259 --> 00:21:39,509
all going to have a space a

609
00:21:39,509 --> 00:21:41,259
representation in this real number

610
00:21:41,259 --> 00:21:43,209
system it might be you know thousands

611
00:21:43,209 --> 00:21:44,979
and thousands of sets of empty sets but

612
00:21:44,979 --> 00:21:48,609
it's possible it can be done and this

613
00:21:48,609 --> 00:21:50,319
real numbers have various interesting

614
00:21:50,319 --> 00:21:51,699
properties which is why mathematicians

615
00:21:51,699 --> 00:21:53,949
are interested in them so for example

616
00:21:53,949 --> 00:21:55,929
the surreal numbers contains more

617
00:21:55,929 --> 00:21:57,609
numbers than our actual real number

618
00:21:57,609 --> 00:21:59,169
system there's some bonus stuff that you

619
00:21:59,169 --> 00:22:00,489
get for free if you use this system

620
00:22:00,489 --> 00:22:02,109
there's some numbers that you can

621
00:22:02,109 --> 00:22:03,459
express as surreal numbers that you

622
00:22:03,459 --> 00:22:05,259
can't express in any other way and they

623
00:22:05,259 --> 00:22:06,669
still behave like numbers you can still

624
00:22:06,669 --> 00:22:09,069
do all the usual mathematical stuff one

625
00:22:09,069 --> 00:22:10,179
interesting example is you have

626
00:22:10,179 --> 00:22:12,249
different sizes for the number infinity

627
00:22:12,249 --> 00:22:14,139
or just have positive infinity you've

628
00:22:14,139 --> 00:22:15,969
got different sizes of infinity and

629
00:22:15,969 --> 00:22:17,199
they're all infinite but some of them

630
00:22:17,199 --> 00:22:19,709
are more infinite than others no

631
00:22:19,709 --> 00:22:23,559
seriously so this is this is an image

632
00:22:23,559 --> 00:22:25,569
which should make it all perfectly clear

633
00:22:25,569 --> 00:22:27,759
to you it's much too tiny to read but

634
00:22:27,759 --> 00:22:29,289
this is from the wikipedia article and

635
00:22:29,289 --> 00:22:30,759
surreal numbers and it shows how you

636
00:22:30,759 --> 00:22:32,139
start from zero and you keep producing

637
00:22:32,139 --> 00:22:33,879
more numbers in terms of the numbers

638
00:22:33,879 --> 00:22:36,369
you've already got and you see down the

639
00:22:36,369 --> 00:22:37,719
bottom it gets very thick it means we've

640
00:22:37,719 --> 00:22:39,009
filled out the number like we've got all

641
00:22:39,009 --> 00:22:42,429
these numbers in that so my stupid idea

642
00:22:42,429 --> 00:22:45,129
was to implement surreal numbers in

643
00:22:45,129 --> 00:22:48,339
JavaScript using empty arrays as empty

644
00:22:48,339 --> 00:22:50,949
sets and as few real numbers as possible

645
00:22:50,949 --> 00:22:52,029
I want to see how far I could get

646
00:22:52,029 --> 00:22:53,759
without using any actual real numbers

647
00:22:53,759 --> 00:22:55,359
just trying to do the whole thing

648
00:22:55,359 --> 00:22:59,079
bootstrapping or surreal numbers so

649
00:22:59,079 --> 00:23:00,940
that's what 0 looks like on the first

650
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:03,429
day conway created 0 and that's how

651
00:23:03,429 --> 00:23:05,729
array with two empty arrays in it and

652
00:23:05,729 --> 00:23:07,690
what would this mean if i got this

653
00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:09,999
working every real number could be

654
00:23:09,999 --> 00:23:11,199
represented so we wouldn't have the

655
00:23:11,199 --> 00:23:12,789
limitations of current javascript

656
00:23:12,789 --> 00:23:14,109
numbers you could go up as high as you

657
00:23:14,109 --> 00:23:15,940
wanted it go as low as you wanted you

658
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:17,549
could get very small numbers

659
00:23:17,549 --> 00:23:18,659
all the fractions and everything would

660
00:23:18,659 --> 00:23:23,039
work properly you wouldn't have the

661
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:24,659
rounding errors that we saw before when

662
00:23:24,659 --> 00:23:28,230
we add point 1 to point 2 there's also

663
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:30,419
no fear of underutilizing your memory

664
00:23:30,419 --> 00:23:33,059
your own because these things are arrays

665
00:23:33,059 --> 00:23:35,100
of a raise if you've got a macbook with

666
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:37,320
eight gig of ram in it you can very

667
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:39,600
easily exhaust that memory just by using

668
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:43,110
fairly small numbers and beyond that

669
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:44,460
there's no need to restart your browser

670
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:46,649
periodically surreal numbers will do

671
00:23:46,649 --> 00:23:48,090
that for you by crashing the browser

672
00:23:48,090 --> 00:23:50,129
entirely so if that's what you're

673
00:23:50,129 --> 00:23:51,509
looking for in a number system this is a

674
00:23:51,509 --> 00:23:53,999
solution for you so how far did I get

675
00:23:53,999 --> 00:23:56,519
with this I've got natural numbers in it

676
00:23:56,519 --> 00:23:58,259
that was a nice surprise to get that

677
00:23:58,259 --> 00:24:00,389
working I can now if I have you know

678
00:24:00,389 --> 00:24:02,129
very very powerful machine I can count

679
00:24:02,129 --> 00:24:05,009
up to infinity I've got all the integers

680
00:24:05,009 --> 00:24:06,659
that means i can count down to minus

681
00:24:06,659 --> 00:24:09,570
infinity that works well are also given

682
00:24:09,570 --> 00:24:13,919
you know infinite computer power so in

683
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:16,320
theory i can go up as high as positive

684
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:17,549
infinity but of course it will crash

685
00:24:17,549 --> 00:24:20,460
long before it gets there I've managed

686
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:22,259
to go from an integer so I can take an a

687
00:24:22,259 --> 00:24:23,850
you know normal human number and convert

688
00:24:23,850 --> 00:24:27,419
that into any surreal number and I can

689
00:24:27,419 --> 00:24:28,799
go the other way I can get the integer

690
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:31,830
version back and I've got the quality

691
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:33,419
working which I'm quite pleased about so

692
00:24:33,419 --> 00:24:34,769
i can say where the true surreal numbers

693
00:24:34,769 --> 00:24:37,529
are equal I've also got the comparisons

694
00:24:37,529 --> 00:24:38,789
working so i can say where the two

695
00:24:38,789 --> 00:24:40,529
numbers are less than or less than or

696
00:24:40,529 --> 00:24:42,509
equal to or greater than or greater than

697
00:24:42,509 --> 00:24:43,769
or equal to that all worked really

698
00:24:43,769 --> 00:24:46,859
nicely so some of the code I was

699
00:24:46,859 --> 00:24:48,450
surprised by how beautiful this turned

700
00:24:48,450 --> 00:24:50,039
out to be you probably can't read that

701
00:24:50,039 --> 00:24:51,600
especially well there but what I've got

702
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:54,090
is the is equal to i define that by

703
00:24:54,090 --> 00:24:55,529
saying a number is equal to another

704
00:24:55,529 --> 00:24:57,779
number if it's both less than or equal

705
00:24:57,779 --> 00:24:59,759
to the other number and greater than or

706
00:24:59,759 --> 00:25:01,289
equal to the other number if both of

707
00:25:01,289 --> 00:25:02,999
those conditions are true if it's both

708
00:25:02,999 --> 00:25:04,590
less than or equal to and greater than

709
00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:06,450
or equal to I know it must actually be

710
00:25:06,450 --> 00:25:08,789
equal to so the test for equality is

711
00:25:08,789 --> 00:25:11,879
just that one single single statement in

712
00:25:11,879 --> 00:25:13,830
that single function now so that was a

713
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:15,570
nice surprise and the rest of the

714
00:25:15,570 --> 00:25:17,460
comparisons are really nice as well I've

715
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:20,249
got is less than is defined by saying

716
00:25:20,249 --> 00:25:24,119
it's not greater than or equal to I to

717
00:25:24,119 --> 00:25:25,350
work out if something is greater than or

718
00:25:25,350 --> 00:25:27,269
equal to I just work out if it's the

719
00:25:27,269 --> 00:25:29,039
other way holds that the other number is

720
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:31,140
less than or equal to this number

721
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:32,820
is greater than it's just the same as

722
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:34,500
the first case I say if it's not less

723
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:37,050
than or equal to so that's all really

724
00:25:37,050 --> 00:25:38,670
nice that's very short amount of code

725
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:40,380
you'll see though that I've only got

726
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:42,090
three of the comparisons in here and you

727
00:25:42,090 --> 00:25:43,380
know that there are four and the reason

728
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:44,910
I've put this on a separate slide this

729
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:46,890
is my beautiful code this is my

730
00:25:46,890 --> 00:25:49,020
nightmare code so to make all of this

731
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:50,640
work all the other ones I could define

732
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,410
in terms of this one this one actually

733
00:25:52,410 --> 00:25:55,140
had to do some work to make it happen

734
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:57,720
and there's a whole bunch of code in

735
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:00,630
there I'm not proud of that stuff it

736
00:26:00,630 --> 00:26:02,970
could probably be improved but it gets

737
00:26:02,970 --> 00:26:04,530
crazy to work out which side of zero

738
00:26:04,530 --> 00:26:07,340
you're on and how large numbers are so

739
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:09,720
if I'd known that was coming I wouldn't

740
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:10,710
have bothered with this and you wouldn't

741
00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:13,830
be hearing from me today so the things

742
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:15,180
i'd like to do i haven't learned my

743
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:16,650
lesson from this i'm still doing this i

744
00:26:16,650 --> 00:26:18,150
think the frustration i have is because

745
00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:19,200
i'm teaching at the moment i'm not

746
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,670
actually making anything new so i'm just

747
00:26:20,670 --> 00:26:23,340
looking for random problems to solve i'd

748
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:24,900
like to get fractions working there in

749
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:25,860
the book but i haven't actually

750
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:27,240
implemented them yet because that's

751
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:29,130
going to mess up all my existing courage

752
00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:31,800
i also have no arithmetic so i can't

753
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,660
actually add or multiply or divide any

754
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:34,860
of these numbers yet i can just make

755
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:36,510
them exist and count with them but

756
00:26:36,510 --> 00:26:39,510
that's all so you can see this code for

757
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:42,300
yourself i put it up on github my

758
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:44,160
username on github is called head and

759
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,780
it's surreal jeaious there's no fancy

760
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:47,700
test suites or anything like that it's

761
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:50,790
just my file with 170 lines of code that

762
00:26:50,790 --> 00:26:52,230
implements the serial numbers but what I

763
00:26:52,230 --> 00:26:53,880
would argue is that it's better to do

764
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,920
this stuff yourself you don't I don't

765
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,150
think I'd make this library because

766
00:26:57,150 --> 00:26:58,530
somebody be like oh that's good i need

767
00:26:58,530 --> 00:27:00,960
an implementation of surreal numbers to

768
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:04,350
do maths in javascript it's more that it

769
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:06,120
was highly educational when a lot of fun

770
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:08,250
to do and i would urge you to go and

771
00:27:08,250 --> 00:27:09,420
have a look at this book it's freely

772
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:11,670
available in various PDF forms you can

773
00:27:11,670 --> 00:27:12,870
go and read it and have a cracker

774
00:27:12,870 --> 00:27:14,430
implementing it or even just pushing

775
00:27:14,430 --> 00:27:15,810
these things around on pen and paper is

776
00:27:15,810 --> 00:27:20,010
that it's fine so I've got also here a

777
00:27:20,010 --> 00:27:21,330
short list of books if you're interested

778
00:27:21,330 --> 00:27:22,950
in any of this this is the things i

779
00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:23,940
would suggest you read if you're

780
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:26,820
interested in this topic douglas

781
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:28,170
hofstadter wrote a couple of books in

782
00:27:28,170 --> 00:27:30,690
the 70s as godel escher bach and eternal

783
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:32,520
golden braid which is about number

784
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:35,070
theory and formal systems and where the

785
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:36,510
computers will ever be able to think

786
00:27:36,510 --> 00:27:38,460
that kind of thing and he also has a

787
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:40,110
series of essays called meta magical

788
00:27:40,110 --> 00:27:43,830
famous rudy rocker is a computer

789
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:44,980
scientist and mathematician

790
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:47,200
titian who also took a lot of drugs and

791
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,460
also wrote a lot of fiction I

792
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:50,200
particularly recommend his where

793
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:52,360
tetralogy which is software wetware

794
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:55,480
freeware and real where which deals with

795
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:57,820
artificial intelligence and robot rights

796
00:27:57,820 --> 00:27:59,919
and things like that but also the hot

797
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:02,559
topic of human robot sex which I know a

798
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:07,299
lot more about now and as an actual

799
00:28:07,299 --> 00:28:08,770
professor he's written a couple of

800
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:10,390
series books so there's book called mind

801
00:28:10,390 --> 00:28:11,830
tools which is about the fundamentals of

802
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:13,570
mathematics and how it works and another

803
00:28:13,570 --> 00:28:15,190
book called infinity and the mind which

804
00:28:15,190 --> 00:28:18,990
is about well just what it says really I

805
00:28:18,990 --> 00:28:21,370
also really liked David Foster Wallace's

806
00:28:21,370 --> 00:28:23,740
recent book everything and more concise

807
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:25,480
history of infinity so these are all pop

808
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:26,860
books they're not for mathematicians of

809
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:28,390
people like us who have some interest in

810
00:28:28,390 --> 00:28:30,549
these things everything and more is just

811
00:28:30,549 --> 00:28:32,710
a history of how mathematicians and

812
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:35,790
magicians have grappled with infinity

813
00:28:35,790 --> 00:28:38,410
I'm also recommending alice in

814
00:28:38,410 --> 00:28:40,000
wonderland with this cute quote from

815
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,160
Alan Perlis the best book on programming

816
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:44,049
for the layman is Alice in Wonderland

817
00:28:44,049 --> 00:28:45,760
but that's because it's the best book on

818
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,679
anything for the layman and if you don't

819
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:48,880
agree with that that just means you

820
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,230
haven't read it enough time so you

821
00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:54,940
should go and give that another shot so

822
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:55,990
what I learned about math so i'll just

823
00:28:55,990 --> 00:28:58,330
quickly sum up with we're actually what

824
00:28:58,330 --> 00:29:00,520
I took away from all of this making math

825
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:02,350
work is actually really hard you think

826
00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:03,970
that's easy children can count I'll be

827
00:29:03,970 --> 00:29:05,080
able to do this for sure I've got a

828
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:06,610
textbook to help me and it's not like

829
00:29:06,610 --> 00:29:08,049
that it actually turns out to be much

830
00:29:08,049 --> 00:29:11,440
trickier than I expected especially if

831
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:12,580
you have to build your own numbers so if

832
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:13,809
you're not using any of javascripts

833
00:29:13,809 --> 00:29:14,950
numbers behind the scenes if you're

834
00:29:14,950 --> 00:29:17,200
doing all yourself you appreciate how

835
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,270
much is going on that when you get it to

836
00:29:19,270 --> 00:29:21,040
work it is incredibly satisfying when

837
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:22,630
you create a giant number you've got an

838
00:29:22,630 --> 00:29:24,220
integer and you say give me the serial

839
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:26,020
number version of this and then you say

840
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:27,549
what's the real number but the integer

841
00:29:27,549 --> 00:29:28,750
version of this and get it back the

842
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:30,669
other way that is satisfying in a way I

843
00:29:30,669 --> 00:29:32,679
wasn't expecting particularly as it's

844
00:29:32,679 --> 00:29:34,330
not actually useful it was just like

845
00:29:34,330 --> 00:29:35,799
I've got this hard problem to solve and

846
00:29:35,799 --> 00:29:38,710
then I fixed it but what I especially

847
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:40,210
have realized is you can't take your

848
00:29:40,210 --> 00:29:42,910
number implementation for granted so if

849
00:29:42,910 --> 00:29:45,130
maths works in your programming language

850
00:29:45,130 --> 00:29:46,960
that's really a big deal people have put

851
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,220
some hard work in there to make that

852
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:50,530
happen for you so if something works you

853
00:29:50,530 --> 00:29:53,260
should hug an implementer and we have

854
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:55,480
Dave here if anyone wants hugs later and

855
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:57,340
how it feels about that but you can

856
00:29:57,340 --> 00:29:59,370
negotiate that with him

857
00:29:59,370 --> 00:30:03,340
what I learned about programming these

858
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:05,080
particular problems this is this is new

859
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:06,220
stuff for me I hadn't solved this

860
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:08,080
particular problem for before and this

861
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:09,850
involved an incredible amount of staring

862
00:30:09,850 --> 00:30:11,470
into the distance lots of walks around

863
00:30:11,470 --> 00:30:13,180
the harbor just thinking about how the

864
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:14,230
hell I'm going to get the next bit

865
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:16,150
working and it didn't look like I was

866
00:30:16,150 --> 00:30:18,120
working but I was working really hard

867
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:20,590
the old fashioned pen and paper approach

868
00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:22,240
goes a long way with these kinds of

869
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:25,600
things where possible it's good to get

870
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,190
anger scroll from Twitter to review your

871
00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:30,070
code he's available on Twitter and I

872
00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:31,900
don't know just asking just send him

873
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:35,080
your your reviews maybe we'll do it he

874
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:40,090
did it for me and finally what I learned

875
00:30:40,090 --> 00:30:43,240
about the big stuff it's good to break

876
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:44,470
your habits and get out of your comfort

877
00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:46,390
zone so as web developers were used to

878
00:30:46,390 --> 00:30:47,740
doing web stuff and we tend to see

879
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:50,620
everything in in terms of you know Dom

880
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:52,450
manipulations or if we're not developers

881
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:54,190
we think about streams all the time it's

882
00:30:54,190 --> 00:30:55,720
good to just do something that isn't of

883
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:57,730
useful used to your isn't necessarily

884
00:30:57,730 --> 00:30:59,860
part of your daily life just as mental

885
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:02,890
exercise and it's you know people say

886
00:31:02,890 --> 00:31:04,330
don't reinvent the wheel you can

887
00:31:04,330 --> 00:31:06,340
reinvent the wheel you can make stranger

888
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:07,660
wheels you can make wheels that don't

889
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:09,070
work as well as the existing wheel the

890
00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:10,600
existing wheel is pretty good but you

891
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:11,860
can learn some interesting stuff by

892
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:13,720
making bizarre new kind of alien wheels

893
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:17,470
that nobody needs but also I got this

894
00:31:17,470 --> 00:31:19,360
nice sense that wonders never cease so

895
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:20,830
the more I've looked into the theory of

896
00:31:20,830 --> 00:31:22,480
mathematics and how it all works the

897
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:23,950
more surprised and kind of delighted I

898
00:31:23,950 --> 00:31:26,350
am there's all this magical stuff that

899
00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:28,510
exists somewhere I don't know how it

900
00:31:28,510 --> 00:31:30,190
works and all these strange properties

901
00:31:30,190 --> 00:31:32,350
arise from like surreal numbers or

902
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:34,020
whatever else you want to look into um

903
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:37,210
but overall I would argue for making

904
00:31:37,210 --> 00:31:38,710
beautiful and useless things just as

905
00:31:38,710 --> 00:31:40,300
something to do it's immensely

906
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:41,860
satisfying it might not help you get a

907
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:44,940
job but you know do it for yourself and

908
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:47,230
that's all I've got I won't be taking

909
00:31:47,230 --> 00:31:48,550
questions because I don't know the

910
00:31:48,550 --> 00:31:56,450
answers but thank you very much

911
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:58,720
if we can put our hands together patrol

912
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,460
again also i have a round of applause to

913
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:02,200
Harvey Birdman who was pivotal in that
