1
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:15,880
Hello?

2
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:16,880
Oh yeah.

3
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:17,880
Okay!

4
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:18,880
All right!

5
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:19,880
We're ready to go!

6
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:20,880
Accessibility means a lot of things.

7
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,600
Sometimes it means a user cannot see or hear.

8
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:25,180
Sometimes it means a user does
not speak your language.

9
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:26,850
And with that, we're actually going to have
a talk

10
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:27,850
that is live translated.

11
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:30,189
We have Felipe and Anna, and they're going
to be

12
00:00:30,189 --> 00:00:32,270
talking about accessibility and JavaScript.

13
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:33,270
Side by side.

14
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:34,270
Yeah.

15
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:35,270
People think that this is like...

16
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:38,500
Sometimes people think that other
people are going to solve this problem, but

17
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:39,500
we're here to encourage you to
take this on yourself.

18
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:40,500
Just be like...

19
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:41,500
Take On Me, accessibility.

20
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:42,500
Get ready
for this.

21
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:43,500
All the way from Brazil, Felipe de Albuquerque.

22
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:44,500
Please applaud!

23
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:45,500
Hello, everybody here.

24
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:46,500
Today I...

25
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:47,500
I don't speak English fluently, but I
bring in this amazing topic, and I have my

26
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:48,500
wife too.

27
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:49,500
She's my boss at the work
at home.

28
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:50,500
She's my manager of my life.

29
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:55,630
And we stay here to talk to you about
this incredible...

30
00:00:55,630 --> 00:00:58,260
Topic.

31
00:00:58,260 --> 00:00:59,650
Accessibility in JS.

32
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:01,740
We'll start now.

33
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:04,530
First of all, I...

34
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:07,939
Just to say thank
you for the JS conference organization, and

35
00:01:07,939 --> 00:01:17,009
CESAR, and all my sponsors, and
so...

36
00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:19,460
Thank you all for coming.

37
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:21,950
It's our pleasure to be here.

38
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:22,950
Okay?

39
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:28,060
Let's get
started now.

40
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:32,670
Oh yeah.

41
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:37,280
Keep going.

42
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:44,390
Who here never listens to any joke about JavaScript?

43
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:49,580
Along the years, I
working with JavaScript, I listen to many

44
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:52,530
lies about JavaScript.

45
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:58,109
And today, I
stand here for talk to you, and try to clean

46
00:01:58,109 --> 00:02:01,530
these bad reputation.

47
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:05,060
Because
JavaScript is a good guy.

48
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:06,189
Not bad guy.

49
00:02:06,189 --> 00:02:08,399
Because I'm still here.

50
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:10,380
With all my
family.

51
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:14,180
And this amazing placing.

52
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:15,570
Because JavaScript...

53
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:18,260
Any other things, but
I...

54
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:19,260
I keep going.

55
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:20,260
Yeah.

56
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:22,380
Because now meeting the...

57
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:24,660
Too short.

58
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:26,940
30 minutes.

59
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:29,210
Keep going.

60
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:34,840
On the agenda for today...

61
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:39,400
Why I stay here for talk about accessibility.

62
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:45,220
Why should I invest in a little...

63
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:46,220
Why?

64
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:54,010
Around the world, according to 
the UN,

65
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:55,010
have...

66
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:56,010
6,000...

67
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:57,010
650 million

68
00:02:57,010 --> 00:03:04,180
650 million people have some kind of special
needs.

69
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:07,780
And in my country, it's
45 million.

70
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:14,770
It mean...

71
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:21,670
Represents almost a quarter...

72
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:24,380
23% of the population.

73
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:29,150
For me, it sounds...

74
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:33,930
Great opportunity at business.

75
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:34,990
In another...

76
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:43,320
Thinking out the box, can be exclude for the
great minds.

77
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,480
Minds.

78
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,810
Sorry, people.

79
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:47,980
It's...

80
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:52,530
English is not my maternal language.

81
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:54,280
Native.

82
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,030
Yeah.

83
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:57,780
But...

84
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:00,810
A strongly...

85
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:03,740
All of you should already...

86
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:05,590
They know.

87
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:13,020
I think the...

88
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:14,020
It's okay.

89
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:15,530
I think if anybody...

90
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:19,560
If nobody matter about him.

91
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:27,100
A lot of things that we would have lost.

92
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,880
You
can also think about Beethoven.

93
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,789
Most of the songs that he has written...

94
00:04:30,789 --> 00:04:42,210
And
then once he couldn't hear anything, then

95
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:49,070
that's when he wrote his most
beautiful songs.

96
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:58,750
Another means...

97
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:04,160
And can we imagine if people didn't care about
songs written by people that

98
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,190
could not hear at all?

99
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:08,190
That did not happen.

100
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:16,380
So Beethoven turned out to be one
of the most famous composers of all time.

101
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:22,410
We need to think out the box.

102
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:30,070
And sometimes I try to talk about
accessibility for another guys, another develops

103
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:32,030
guy, and anybody...

104
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:37,980
No
matter, because it can be a tough...

105
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:40,330
Into a...

106
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:46,940
Anybody don't know about
accessibility's effect.

107
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:53,750
Most people don't really know what accessibility
is all about.

108
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:56,980
What is accessibility?

109
00:05:56,980 --> 00:06:01,590
It's nothing to do, because it's not accessible
--

110
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:08,460
many guys try to make the application accessible,
but...

111
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:13,980
It has nothing to do with this image, at all.

112
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:14,980
(laughing)

113
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:15,980
And I...

114
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:18,990
I just to say for you...

115
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:26,130
Anything is accessible that cannot be
improved.

116
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:34,200
Yeah, that's what's written over there.

117
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:36,520
Accessibility...

118
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:42,110
Because we at times thinking about the...

119
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:45,950
(speaking Portuguese)

120
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:53,580
It's our new project to try to change.

121
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,110
Because it...

122
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:58,960
We need to see it
another way.

123
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:07,750
Because those peoples are able and active
and independent and

124
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:08,750
engaged.

125
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:12,479
Many disability people are engaged in...

126
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:15,150
(speaking Portuguese)

127
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:20,340
Yeah, just think about Stephen Hawking and
that's it.

128
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:22,810
And many other people.

129
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:25,090
But who needs accessibility?

130
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:30,300
We always...

131
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:32,680
Fought
about accessibility.

132
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:37,979
And blind people -- but it's not one.

133
00:07:37,979 --> 00:07:39,430
Not just one.

134
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:41,760
But
it's all time...

135
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:44,710
We thought about...

136
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:53,130
It's necessary to think about temporary
disability.

137
00:07:53,130 --> 00:07:55,520
Um...

138
00:07:55,520 --> 00:08:02,190
When you get injured, and then maybe any of
you guys here could be in

139
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:03,310
that situation.

140
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:06,750
And perhaps need some kind of...

141
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:09,960
Accessible feature.

142
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:13,199
All that is about the interaction design.

143
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:19,080
Because the most important
technology is not technology.

144
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:23,389
Keep going.

145
00:08:23,389 --> 00:08:25,240
But it's people.

146
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:30,710
Innovations are made for people.

147
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:34,930
(speaking Portuguese)

148
00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:39,940
Innovation is made from people to people.

149
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:42,080
And another one...

150
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:46,470
It's colorblind people.

151
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:47,480
Many levels...

152
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:49,600
Colors...

153
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,730
Somebody...

154
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:59,320
Who can't see the right colors.

155
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:05,870
And people for different ages and countries,
and...

156
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:09,270
Yeah, kids, for instance.

157
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:16,800
So, for example, our kids -- when they didn't
know how to write, they would just touch the

158
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:22,480
speech button on the search
place, in the application, and they would

159
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:25,720
scream out the name of the...

160
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:29,210
(imitating kid)

161
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:32,950
Yeah, Let It Go!

162
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:34,150
Frozen!

163
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:35,700
Perfectly worked.

164
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:36,700
Oh, thank god.

165
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:40,020
I don't need to
write it now.

166
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:45,340
We need to think about the peoples -- don't
listen, don't written.

167
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:46,340
Hearing.

168
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:48,660
How do you say...

169
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:51,600
So yeah, don't forget about people who can't
listen.

170
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,480
Can't hear.

171
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:57,040
Because --
always remember that they might need subtitles,

172
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:00,070
or even the transcriptions
that they have here.

173
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:01,779
>>(speaking Portuguese)

174
00:10:01,779 --> 00:10:06,920
I have just said that, baby.

175
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:07,920
Sorry.

176
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:08,920
Yeah.

177
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:09,920
People can feel...

178
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:13,850
Essential things about the documentation.

179
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:20,461
It's the most
important, because we need to know about the

180
00:10:20,461 --> 00:10:23,160
documentation, but it's...

181
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:26,490
(speaking Portuguese)

182
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:28,390
Even though it's extremely rich...

183
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:29,390
Very rich...

184
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:35,990
Some people might get scared, because it's
an alphabet soup.

185
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:37,209
Many...

186
00:10:37,209 --> 00:10:40,600
But today we're focusing...

187
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,899
Focusing...

188
00:10:41,899 --> 00:10:49,560
On the accessibility,
because we too need our applications.

189
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:54,120
And this Y-ARIA.

190
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,670
It's the most important.

191
00:10:56,670 --> 00:10:59,430
Because all of the JavaScript --

192
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:05,200
I will be talking along this presentation.

193
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,200
I just...

194
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:17,760
To help the WCAG...

195
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:25,690
It's divided into four basic principles.

196
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:30,000
Yes.

197
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,550
The perceivable...

198
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:33,020
Perceivable.

199
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:34,490
Understandable.

200
00:11:34,490 --> 00:11:35,970
Operable.

201
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:37,290
And robust.

202
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:41,190
Perceivable is distinguishable information.

203
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:46,670
We need
to provide alternative texts, in the application

204
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:48,180
-- adaptable.

205
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:49,710
Adaptable...

206
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:51,610
Is
actually...

207
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:54,589
Is many...

208
00:11:54,589 --> 00:11:58,880
Talk about responsive web design.

209
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,220
And other things.

210
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:06,570
Operable -- the application needs...

211
00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:12,240
Navigate for keyboard, because some
people don't...

212
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,240
Can...

213
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:24,020
Can use an application with the mouse.

214
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:25,020
The mouse.

215
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:26,020
And to...(speaking Portuguese)

216
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:32,750
There are people who can even wear gadgets
on their heads, and use them to

217
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:34,330
access their applications.

218
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:39,160
But normally, those people use that...

219
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:42,180
The tab or enter...

220
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:43,180
Yeah.

221
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:47,300
That seems strange, but some people still
like to use the keyboard to

222
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:49,800
navigate their websites.

223
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:55,610
Most important of that --

224
00:12:55,610 --> 00:13:04,920
The third point.

225
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:05,920
Is because...

226
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:06,940
What do you want to say?

227
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:07,940
>>(speaking Portuguese)

228
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:09,360
These may cause seizures.

229
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,040
So you need to be careful about the colors
you

230
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,040
use.

231
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,040
If it's blinking too much.

232
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,860
Yeah.

233
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:20,500
(speaking Portuguese)

234
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:25,540
Some people develop some applications, some
games or something really

235
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:30,290
interactive...

236
00:13:30,290 --> 00:13:35,860
With lights blinking all the time, to emphasize
something.

237
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:40,890
But
there's a recommendation that says that you

238
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:46,330
cannot blink more than three times
per second.

239
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:48,560
Because that can provoke seizures.

240
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:53,300
And also the color combination
-- because if there's a red light blinking

241
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:59,250
too much...

242
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:00,750
People can also...

243
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:03,800
It
can cause also...

244
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:04,800
Seizures.

245
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,700
This is the most extreme case.

246
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:13,630
Never play a game in a long time, enough that...

247
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:16,170
Get a little bit dizzy.

248
00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:18,720
You may get a little bit dizzy.

249
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,000
Because that stimulate light...

250
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,060
Yeah.

251
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:25,170
Keep going.

252
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:27,279
That's okay.

253
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:28,329
Understandable.

254
00:14:28,329 --> 00:14:31,769
This is very understandable.

255
00:14:31,769 --> 00:14:42,370
Because WCAG is
-- no application could be...

256
00:14:42,370 --> 00:14:44,200
Legible.

257
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:50,640
Predictable, and has its input -- you're going
to explain a little bit more

258
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:54,580
in future.

259
00:14:54,580 --> 00:15:02,790
This one I can tell that it's kind of -- the
God of software

260
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:03,790
development.

261
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:08,110
Because this is what everybody wants.

262
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:12,730
Is that your application
works in every single device.

263
00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:13,730
Yeah.

264
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:14,730
Every resolution.

265
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:15,730
In all browsers.

266
00:15:15,730 --> 00:15:16,730
Platforms.

267
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:17,730
Everywhere.

268
00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:18,730
That's very difficult.

269
00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:20,040
But can be possible.

270
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:30,170
And that requires a lot of effort, right?

271
00:15:30,170 --> 00:15:32,950
We can do it.

272
00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:34,170
Yes, we can.

273
00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:36,269
User agents -- do you know them?

274
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:41,290
Because user agents -- this guy can be a
user agent.

275
00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:44,740
Normally blind people use this guy, but this
guy can be

276
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:48,360
inaccessible, because this guy is...

277
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,360
Very...

278
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,360
Expensive.

279
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:52,529
Is many expense.

280
00:15:52,529 --> 00:15:54,320
Because this guy is very training.

281
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,320
Very...

282
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,590
It requires a lot of training.

283
00:15:57,590 --> 00:16:03,360
So in Brazil, for instance, it can cost you
like $60,000 Brazilian reals.

284
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,959
What would be $20,000 US.

285
00:16:05,959 --> 00:16:12,510
So that's not
accessible at all.

286
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:13,510
But normally...

287
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:14,510
With...

288
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:17,240
We are used to...

289
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:20,030
To interact with browser.

290
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:31,200
Never has a problem with how long the software
development...

291
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,200
In using browsers.

292
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,690
The different browsers.

293
00:16:33,690 --> 00:16:36,230
(speaking Portuguese)

294
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:38,110
Our big...

295
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:39,110
Something...

296
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:44,660
That we're really scared about some time ago.

297
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:46,750
The
reality is changing.

298
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:48,920
A little bit better.

299
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:54,380
But we still face a lot of problems,
when developing with browsers.

300
00:16:54,380 --> 00:17:03,190
Understand the engine of the browser is very
difficult, but...

301
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:04,889
(speaking Portuguese)

302
00:17:04,889 --> 00:17:05,889
Yeah.

303
00:17:05,889 --> 00:17:07,929
Sometimes we cannot sleep at night.

304
00:17:07,929 --> 00:17:11,299
Just thinking about the solution
to resolve this problem.

305
00:17:11,299 --> 00:17:12,959
But normally we usually...

306
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:17,809
The text-to-speech...

307
00:17:17,809 --> 00:17:22,360
Application.

308
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:24,490
I bring to you...

309
00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:27,400
Yeah, you can see the disc.

310
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:31,290
Because to know how old that is.

311
00:17:31,290 --> 00:17:33,120
Left, top.

312
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,660
So you can see how old this is.

313
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:35,660
Technology.

314
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:36,660
It's really...

315
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:41,820
The application, in transforming in voice.

316
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:43,630
And...

317
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:47,500
Our
researches about the most of...

318
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,500
Most used screen readers.

319
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:52,320
Thank you, baby.

320
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:55,130
Thank you, sweetie.

321
00:17:55,130 --> 00:17:57,669
And in other ways...

322
00:17:57,669 --> 00:18:00,580
I brought this here.

323
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:06,660
This slide is more specifically, because...

324
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:12,590
Some
people ask Felipe, why are you worrying about

325
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:14,410
accessibility?

326
00:18:14,410 --> 00:18:16,140
In mobile
applications?

327
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:25,400
Why would a blind person use it in their mobile
device?

328
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,820
Right?

329
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:30,280
And I would like to answer to those people...

330
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:35,330
That the same way that we use
it, they can also use it.

331
00:18:35,330 --> 00:18:36,700
It's a change in the mindset.

332
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:37,700
Right?

333
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:39,490
It's a human...

334
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:42,850
It's a human right.

335
00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:45,840
Basic human right.

336
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,070
Yeah.

337
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:49,529
(speaking Portuguese)

338
00:18:49,529 --> 00:18:59,670
And in this slide, I brought to you...

339
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:05,300
To show you what we would need to do
to make it compatible with...

340
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:09,910
To connect with -- now our user agent.

341
00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:12,740
We have to do more.

342
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:19,440
Because we have
to teach now a browser, now a user agent...

343
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,760
(speaking Portuguese)

344
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:26,950
'til they can actually speak.

345
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:31,440
We need to teach the user agents how to
speak.

346
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,260
This is not actually very difficult.

347
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:41,080
So if you can observe this code
I've written, it's a very extremely basic

348
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:42,080
html.

349
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,720
But it is...

350
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:47,550
The kickoff
point.

351
00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:56,430
A starting point.

352
00:19:56,430 --> 00:20:00,530
Some people make some basic mistakes when
they're

353
00:20:00,530 --> 00:20:01,530
writing their code.

354
00:20:01,530 --> 00:20:06,780
They don't care, or they forget to set up
the correct doc

355
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:08,440
type, or even the language.

356
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,340
It can screw everything up.

357
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:14,910
If you do not set it
up in the way that the screen reader can use

358
00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:21,630
it, the screen reader will try to
read your text in a language which is different

359
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:23,140
from the one you had set.

360
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:26,220
So
it's going to screw everything up.

361
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:28,460
The types...

362
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:29,460
The title.

363
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:36,299
Is the first thing the browser choose to say,
to

364
00:20:36,299 --> 00:20:38,250
read the page.

365
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:39,770
And other means.

366
00:20:39,770 --> 00:20:51,080
How various entry JavaScript and accessibility
-- I need to have for Minnesota University...

367
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:54,600
I read in the paper of them...

368
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:55,809
Say...

369
00:20:55,809 --> 00:20:58,550
I sum up that...

370
00:20:58,550 --> 00:21:06,820
And four principal barriers, my vision about
all the

371
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:08,700
saying the...

372
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:11,890
To read about the...

373
00:21:11,890 --> 00:21:13,010
About that.

374
00:21:13,010 --> 00:21:15,630
And the first one is...

375
00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:20,690
The
browsers don't support JavaScript or have

376
00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:21,780
disability...

377
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:23,960
Disabled JavaScript.

378
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,710
It's a big lie.

379
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:26,710
But it's...

380
00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:27,850
Today, it's a big lie.

381
00:21:27,850 --> 00:21:31,870
A long time ago, it's a
many...

382
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:33,039
It's a...

383
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:35,230
Half truth.

384
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:43,280
But today you can see that 97% of the browsers
support

385
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,280
JavaScript.

386
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:51,530
Standing here today for say to you, and my
Grandma use JavaScript, and she

387
00:21:51,530 --> 00:22:00,960
don't know about 
it mean.

388
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:01,960
That's right.

389
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:05,360
This is not fair with JavaScript.

390
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:08,620
To blame JavaScript.

391
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:10,559
And...

392
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:16,400
For another 2%...

393
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,350
We need to...

394
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:22,740


395
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:27,230
Give them some alternative.

396
00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:30,600
So that they don't...

397
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,059
Okay.

398
00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:34,430
It's
a little bit difficult...

399
00:22:34,430 --> 00:22:35,430
It's...

400
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:37,780
Yeah, anybody use.

401
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:42,450
Not even Microsoft wants to give support to
it.

402
00:22:42,450 --> 00:22:44,210
But yes...

403
00:22:44,210 --> 00:22:45,210
Nightmare.

404
00:22:45,210 --> 00:22:49,610
A long time ago.

405
00:22:49,610 --> 00:22:57,230
Thank God I don't need to worry about it anymore.

406
00:22:57,230 --> 00:23:02,280
Another code is Microsoft dev -- is...

407
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:06,400
We have to think out the box in a
novel approach, because...

408
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,429
To think...

409
00:23:07,429 --> 00:23:08,470
About what?

410
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:15,429
How can I say that?

411
00:23:15,429 --> 00:23:20,950
>>(speaking Portuguese)

412
00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:24,070
About the identify browsers.

413
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:28,240
Oh, how to identify browsers.

414
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:32,730
So you would write different code, depending
on the browser that you would be using.

415
00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:37,250
But instead of that, Microsoft has
designed a code that would detect the features

416
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:39,160
compatibility instead of
browsers.

417
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:41,390
Another here is...

418
00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:51,549
Lack of knowledge of the ARIA.

419
00:23:51,549 --> 00:23:52,549
ARIA...

420
00:23:52,549 --> 00:24:00,250
ARIA for Mozilla
devs...

421
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:06,450
This is what they talk about.

422
00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:11,120
ARIA is between accessibility...

423
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:13,480
Between accessibility and JS.

424
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:15,870
What connect accessibility and JS.

425
00:24:15,870 --> 00:24:22,150
If it did
not exist, JavaScript could not work with

426
00:24:22,150 --> 00:24:24,429
accessibility at all.

427
00:24:24,429 --> 00:24:27,289
That's the work flow.

428
00:24:27,289 --> 00:24:29,429
How it's working.

429
00:24:29,429 --> 00:24:31,230
User agents...

430
00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:32,230
Interact.

431
00:24:32,230 --> 00:24:33,230


432
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:38,330
With the assistive technology.

433
00:24:38,330 --> 00:24:46,480
Able for standard of ARIA.

434
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:51,680
One of
my heroes, who did the JQuery.

435
00:24:51,680 --> 00:25:02,440
I have already earned a lot of money from
JQuery, thanks to him.

436
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:08,700
JQuery is a top technology.

437
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:11,210
Another amazing...

438
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:19,190
Like the (inaudible).

439
00:25:19,190 --> 00:25:23,640
Today
in our life is a very...

440
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:24,690
Easy.

441
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:28,370
But the guys for me...

442
00:25:28,370 --> 00:25:30,890
A big honor of the
amazing frameworks.

443
00:25:30,890 --> 00:25:35,299
This is the language --

444
00:25:35,299 --> 00:25:39,179
Just forgot to mention what he said on the
previous slide.

445
00:25:39,179 --> 00:25:40,179
It's already
implemented.

446
00:25:40,179 --> 00:25:41,840
So it's not a dream.

447
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:42,840
Right?

448
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:50,630
This is the rules of ARIA.

449
00:25:50,630 --> 00:25:53,039
Thank you.

450
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:56,659
ARIA is able...

451
00:25:56,659 --> 00:25:57,669
To say...

452
00:25:57,669 --> 00:26:04,409
The
browsing and other user agents -- technology

453
00:26:04,409 --> 00:26:14,370
for the piece of the code, HTML5
is the most semantic, but this is able really

454
00:26:14,370 --> 00:26:17,620
semantic to for...

455
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:19,660
Almost...

456
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:24,310
All
the engines.

457
00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:27,159
Rich internet application with AJAX.

458
00:26:27,159 --> 00:26:29,850
AJAX of the old time --
but...

459
00:26:29,850 --> 00:26:30,850
Five minutes?

460
00:26:30,850 --> 00:26:31,860
Oh, no!

461
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:38,030
It's amazing.

462
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:41,120
We know about the AJAX, I think,
so...

463
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,679
Or somebody used...

464
00:26:42,679 --> 00:26:45,169
Don't know about that.

465
00:26:45,169 --> 00:26:48,020
This is my hero too.

466
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:52,570
ARIA
live is the only way for interactive application,

467
00:26:52,570 --> 00:26:55,330
rich applications, to...

468
00:26:55,330 --> 00:26:57,170
(speaking Portuguese)

469
00:26:57,170 --> 00:27:01,700
The only thing that can really enable...

470
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:08,730
Because the big problem is that
the browsers cannot...

471
00:27:08,730 --> 00:27:14,190
Understand when some contents are updated
on the web

472
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:15,190
page.

473
00:27:15,190 --> 00:27:18,940
It's very simple, but it's the most important.

474
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:20,830
It's the only way for...

475
00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:22,539
Let's keep going.

476
00:27:22,539 --> 00:27:25,000
To make rich internet applications.

477
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,249
And other rules.

478
00:27:28,249 --> 00:27:29,249
And another.

479
00:27:29,249 --> 00:27:33,710
And
another time I stay here...

480
00:27:33,710 --> 00:27:39,179
Along the event, I can talk to you about that.

481
00:27:39,179 --> 00:27:42,070
Example...

482
00:27:42,070 --> 00:27:46,679
It's very, very, very easy.

483
00:27:46,679 --> 00:27:48,640
But it's necessary.

484
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:54,480
Difficult or
impossible navigation with keyboard...

485
00:27:54,480 --> 00:28:06,200
It's a big problem we have, because in
application, don't enable navigate to keyboard.

486
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:12,500
About the links -- we can...

487
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:17,039
Avoid using titles.

488
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:18,659
Names.

489
00:28:18,659 --> 00:28:21,900
Generic names.

490
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:23,520
Because...

491
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:24,520
The names...

492
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:25,950
(speaking Portuguese)

493
00:28:25,950 --> 00:28:30,340
Because when a screen reader is going to read
it, the user will not

494
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:32,320
understand it appropriately.

495
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:35,230
So you had better choose a long description.

496
00:28:35,230 --> 00:28:39,090
To
help it out.

497
00:28:39,090 --> 00:28:44,330
About the navigation -- is mainly important
for applications, because...

498
00:28:44,330 --> 00:28:52,050
The other big problem about it is that people
can navigate through tab, but

499
00:28:52,050 --> 00:28:53,990
can never reach the contents.

500
00:28:53,990 --> 00:29:00,850
So you can raise the skip navigation method.

501
00:29:00,850 --> 00:29:05,299
So
you can also use this with CSS, to outline...

502
00:29:05,299 --> 00:29:09,590
Okay.

503
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:13,309
To kind of highlight the
place where people are navigating through

504
00:29:13,309 --> 00:29:15,330
the keyboard.

505
00:29:15,330 --> 00:29:20,730
So this approach of
skipping the navigation...

506
00:29:20,730 --> 00:29:24,061
Is extremely efficient, but you need to focus
the...

507
00:29:24,061 --> 00:29:30,320
You need to set the focus correctly in the
JavaScript as well.

508
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:32,840
Because
if you cannot set the focus, when you're going

509
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:34,580
to navigate it, the focus...

510
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:38,470
Go
back to or change to a different place.

511
00:29:38,470 --> 00:29:40,330
It can mess everything around.

512
00:29:40,330 --> 00:29:41,850
This is
another example.

513
00:29:41,850 --> 00:29:46,080
That is very cool for you to understand when
you're learning

514
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:47,919
accessibility.

515
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:51,610
Two minutes.

516
00:29:51,610 --> 00:29:55,299
(speaking Portuguese)

517
00:29:55,299 --> 00:30:03,440
To think about mobile.

518
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:08,040
And then they see that it does not work.

519
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:12,309
Because
some applications, some mobile applications,

520
00:30:12,309 --> 00:30:20,059
do not consider clicking the
events click events.

521
00:30:20,059 --> 00:30:23,650
You can use the touch screen, or even the
keyboard.

522
00:30:23,650 --> 00:30:28,850
This
is another approach, to show the menu.

523
00:30:28,850 --> 00:30:33,929
To open the menu using the keyboard.

524
00:30:33,929 --> 00:30:37,220
And finally, what would be the great (inaudible)
of the accessible

525
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:41,030
applications?

526
00:30:41,030 --> 00:30:55,470
So here I brought to you the champions.

527
00:30:55,470 --> 00:30:58,289
There were some contests
in Brazil.

528
00:30:58,289 --> 00:31:01,720
So those were the winners.

529
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:06,710
And you can see that they have that kind
of menu at the top.

530
00:31:06,710 --> 00:31:07,710
The right top.

531
00:31:07,710 --> 00:31:10,529
Or the left top.

532
00:31:10,529 --> 00:31:18,000
From where you can control
the contrast, the font size, or skip to the

533
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,350
content.

534
00:31:19,350 --> 00:31:22,940
So those are really basic
things that your website or your application

535
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:24,760
should consider.

536
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:27,190
And so here I
brought you an example of how to control the

537
00:31:27,190 --> 00:31:37,820
font size, increase or decrease
it, how to set the contrast right.

538
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:44,460
So I wrote a sample of this code, and it's
already on Github for you to contribute if

539
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:45,780
you want.

540
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:50,610
It's called side-by-side
JS.

541
00:31:50,610 --> 00:31:54,970
And the creator of the web says we always
need to care about the

542
00:31:54,970 --> 00:31:56,090
standards.

543
00:31:56,090 --> 00:31:59,679
Need to be compatible with them.

544
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:04,340
And the message I really brought
to you today is that the most important thing

545
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:13,230
after all is that we need to
know about interactive design.

546
00:32:13,230 --> 00:32:15,960
And I'm sorry that I could not...

547
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:18,230
I did not
have the time to talk about what?

548
00:32:18,230 --> 00:32:22,380
Can you repeat that?

549
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:23,380
That's all.

550
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:24,380
Thank you.

551
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:25,380
Okay.

552
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:26,380
So...

553
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:27,549
We hope you guys enjoyed it.

554
00:32:27,549 --> 00:32:28,549
And...

555
00:32:28,549 --> 00:32:32,660
If you want to know more
about that matter, that topic, you can just

556
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:35,260
