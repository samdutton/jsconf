1
00:00:06,589 --> 00:00:09,690

he said although my name tag actually

2
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:12,809
just says math on it so I'll respond

3
00:00:12,809 --> 00:00:15,780
equally to math or Angelina and I work

4
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:19,980
for a place called Mozilla and this is

5
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:21,660
me on Twitter for all of you time

6
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:22,920
travelers in the audience because right

7
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:24,269
now I'm going to pretend it's mostly the

8
00:00:24,269 --> 00:00:26,189
year 2000 i'm trying to think right now

9
00:00:26,189 --> 00:00:28,320
what Angelina was doing in the year 2000

10
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,179
I would have been about 15 which

11
00:00:30,179 --> 00:00:32,279
probably means that at that point I've

12
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:33,930
been building websites and programming

13
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:35,850
but things look random stuff and playing

14
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:37,110
video games for maybe about five or six

15
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:39,000
years my first website was on Angel Fire

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,980
it was all about my favorite animal the

17
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:44,340
dolphin I pronounce it no I'm not I'm

18
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:45,870
not even joking i wish that i wish i

19
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:47,250
wish i had an archive of that somewhere

20
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:49,440
the ones that came after that were on

21
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,149
geo cities and they catalogued my really

22
00:00:51,149 --> 00:00:53,660
sweet video game music midi collection

23
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:57,059
and yeah so 15 I was probably like

24
00:00:57,059 --> 00:00:58,680
hacking on websites my mom's basement

25
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:01,140
and like stealing her liquor not much

26
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:02,340
has really changed i just don't live in

27
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:04,140
my mom's basement anymore and i canna

28
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:06,180
for my own liquor so that's good but

29
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:07,950
yeah that's me on twitter if you like

30
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:10,049
occasional complaining sometimes tweets

31
00:01:10,049 --> 00:01:11,369
about code and a lot of cuddly animals

32
00:01:11,369 --> 00:01:18,030
and like i said i work at mozilla so you

33
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:19,049
may have heard of our web browser

34
00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:21,630
firefox which at the year 2000 has world

35
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:23,400
we had like something like maybe seven

36
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,380
to ten percent depending on what browser

37
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:27,780
share you know statistics that you

38
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:30,299
looked at and so i know that even though

39
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:31,680
I'm from Mozilla and most of you are

40
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,600
probably internet explorer developers in

41
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,340
the room given that eighty six to ninety

42
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:36,570
percent of you are using Internet

43
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:39,630
Explorer don't worry the information I'm

44
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:41,250
going to share with you today about SEO

45
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:43,740
is applicable to anybody using any kind

46
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:47,700
of browser so first of all what is SEO I

47
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:49,350
mean Jen spoiled it a little bit i'll

48
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:51,180
tell you what how i like to personally

49
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:54,960
define it as search engine optimization

50
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,140
okay so well what does that mean based

51
00:01:58,140 --> 00:01:59,729
on this really awesome chart that i

52
00:01:59,729 --> 00:02:01,920
found on the internet i can tell you

53
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,369
that jen is absolutely correct clearly

54
00:02:05,369 --> 00:02:08,190
somebody who knows photoshop and knows

55
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:09,929
how to render things in 3d and therefore

56
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:11,960
a smarter than all of us in the room

57
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,700
this fabulous graph which what I saw it

58
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:15,440
is like holy I have to do my talk

59
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:18,290
on SEO for DML comp because it is more

60
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:20,930
important than idea it is more important

61
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:22,250
than code and it is more important the

62
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:25,790
design so there are three parts to sort

63
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:27,830
of three key skill areas that you want

64
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:29,300
to have to get into search engine

65
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:33,260
optimization which are you technical and

66
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:34,790
I think since I'm talking to a group of

67
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:36,500
advanced webmasters here that largely

68
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:39,230
you guys are going to be okay you need

69
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:40,340
to have technical skill so you need to

70
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:42,320
know about your HTML tags you need to

71
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:44,000
know about your D HTML tags you need to

72
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,770
know about like some CSS that new thing

73
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:46,730
i don't i don't know if it's going to

74
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:49,850
catch on but we'll see and you you know

75
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:51,350
then you take those technical skills and

76
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:52,730
you look at your on-page optimization

77
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:54,320
which is largely what we're going to

78
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,940
talk about here today and you're off

79
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:57,380
page optimization which is a lot of

80
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:59,870
handshaking and buying links so the

81
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:01,040
first thing you want to do I mean like

82
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,990
like what this really gets you is I mean

83
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:04,160
the first thing you do is you optimize

84
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:06,680
your site for search engines and then

85
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:07,940
after that that gets you more traffic

86
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:09,410
that's your end goal here with your

87
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:11,990
search engine optimization step 3 it

88
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:13,700
doesn't really matter and step for you

89
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:15,050
make money and I learned all this from

90
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:17,750
this really great book make money online

91
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:19,580
now the simple strategy that made me an

92
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:21,620
internet millionaire I'm actually a

93
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:25,310
dogecoin dogecoin doji lien era so that

94
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:27,230
counts as far as I'm concerned for being

95
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:29,300
an internet millionaire and then I found

96
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:31,160
this graphic which was this is just

97
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:33,560
amazing let's just take this in here so

98
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:34,880
first I like that you start if it so

99
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:37,100
where do you start right like do I start

100
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:39,200
on that side okay i'm going to pretend i

101
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,180
start with website won't rank because

102
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:42,920
like I just don't actually have one

103
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:43,850
right now if you go to my website

104
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:45,860
reality hacking net is just an engine X

105
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:47,180
page and it's somebody tweets me about

106
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:49,430
it every day I'm just being lazy so my

107
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:52,070
website won't rank scream rant shout

108
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:53,690
shake fist that was before I got here so

109
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:57,620
we're good by links um hey you we talk

110
00:03:57,620 --> 00:04:00,590
later website still won't rank scream

111
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:03,890
shout shake fist anyway so hopefully I'm

112
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:04,990
going to teach you some things here that

113
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:08,870
will keep this cycle a lot shorter so

114
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:10,160
one of the things you might be asking

115
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,480
yourself is maybe you've heard that

116
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:13,100
there are companies people out there

117
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:15,350
that are SEO professionals and you might

118
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:16,820
be asking yourself if you want to hire

119
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:18,830
one of those SEO professionals after

120
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:20,810
after you know being an SEO professional

121
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:23,540
myself for basically 80 years I happen

122
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:25,330
to know everything about SEO and

123
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:26,889
tell you that if you are an advanced

124
00:04:26,889 --> 00:04:28,419
webmaster and you know how to do some of

125
00:04:28,419 --> 00:04:29,530
the tricks in this presentation you will

126
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:32,080
be totally totally fun in fact if you

127
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,069
know how most of you are probably

128
00:04:33,069 --> 00:04:35,080
writing your web pages in front page

129
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,639
some of you might be using Dreamweaver

130
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:38,379
Dreamweavers pretty hot right now I used

131
00:04:38,379 --> 00:04:40,750
to all its 2,000 so i use dreamweaver

132
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:42,490
Dreamweavers pretty great don't use it

133
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:44,080
for WYSIWYG but actually the terms of

134
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,610
like syntax highlighting is that as a

135
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:47,110
code editor it was ahead of its time in

136
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:50,620
my opinion so this is my advice to you

137
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:52,629
and how you can get your website to rank

138
00:04:52,629 --> 00:04:54,189
well so the first thing you want to do

139
00:04:54,189 --> 00:04:55,689
is of course you need to be submitting

140
00:04:55,689 --> 00:04:57,250
your search engine or submitting your

141
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:58,500
site to search engines and directories

142
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:02,050
and this is 2000 so actually it takes

143
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:03,759
Google about four to six weeks to

144
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:05,740
process your submission and rank your

145
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:08,169
site on on their search engine or at

146
00:05:08,169 --> 00:05:09,819
least that's what a bunch of sites will

147
00:05:09,819 --> 00:05:11,949
tell you so you want to be submitting

148
00:05:11,949 --> 00:05:13,810
your site often and regularly and early

149
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:15,159
you probably should have done it four to

150
00:05:15,159 --> 00:05:17,349
six weeks ago now this is a quote from a

151
00:05:17,349 --> 00:05:19,629
web page and I love this it says a true

152
00:05:19,629 --> 00:05:21,909
search engine optimization specialist

153
00:05:21,909 --> 00:05:23,349
knows the difference between a search

154
00:05:23,349 --> 00:05:26,139
engine in a directory and now that so

155
00:05:26,139 --> 00:05:29,590
that's right so by extension if you know

156
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:30,789
that and you're in the room right now

157
00:05:30,789 --> 00:05:32,379
you are a true search engine

158
00:05:32,379 --> 00:05:34,060
optimization specialist and I bet you

159
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:36,190
didn't even know it Thanks clicks calm

160
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:38,969
and that's clicks with a Z by the way

161
00:05:38,969 --> 00:05:41,409
this is a blank slide and I actually

162
00:05:41,409 --> 00:05:42,759
really don't know what was supposed to

163
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:45,129
be here so I'm going to then mention

164
00:05:45,129 --> 00:05:46,659
that some search engines happened to be

165
00:05:46,659 --> 00:05:50,440
Yahoo altavista like coast which as I

166
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,789
mentioned earlier if you go to lycos com

167
00:05:51,789 --> 00:05:53,650
it still exists as a search engine which

168
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:56,319
kind of blew my mind ask jeeves which

169
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:58,389
when I was like 13 or 14 I just freaking

170
00:05:58,389 --> 00:05:59,650
loved ask jeeves because I like to

171
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:01,360
picture this tiny little robot person

172
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,860
that was like they're in behind a

173
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:04,690
computer and answering it for me and

174
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:06,219
then my brother suggested me one day be

175
00:06:06,219 --> 00:06:07,810
like what if there actually is a Jeeves

176
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:09,460
Angelina like what if there's just this

177
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:11,440
guy and he's sitting there all he does

178
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,060
is search for people and I was like holy

179
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:15,250
 actually that's pretty heavy and

180
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:17,500
actually that's pretty heavy and
then msn kind of ended up being a player

181
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,360
in the game and as for directories I

182
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,500
don't think actually created a slide for

183
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:21,849
that but there was like oh there's open

184
00:06:21,849 --> 00:06:24,940
directory and there was like yahoo had a

185
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:26,259
directory and that's like the only two

186
00:06:26,259 --> 00:06:28,120
that ever really come up oh yeah google

187
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,500
i guess they're pretty important hey who

188
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:30,990
knows what's going to happen with them

189
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:33,250
okay so this is another favorite of mine

190
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:34,990
this chart this chart someone made to

191
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:36,969
represent sort of like the search engine

192
00:06:36,969 --> 00:06:38,740
share at the time you've got see you

193
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:39,070
actually

194
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:40,930
Google taking up a big chunk here Yahoo

195
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:43,060
MSN and ask and my favorite thing about

196
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:44,560
this was the way the shark was described

197
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,910
with an asterisk underneath it

198
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:48,220
disclaimer the pie chart image is not an

199
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:49,900
exact representation of market share for

200
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:51,550
any company mentioned but simply a

201
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:53,320
visual presentation for educational

202
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:55,210
purposes translation this doesn't

203
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:57,670
 mean anything this is

204
00:06:57,670 --> 00:06:59,680
mean anything this is
but I just really wanted a chart to make

205
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,870
my content flushed out and I just I love

206
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:03,670
that because it's honest without being

207
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:07,030
honest at all so really I mean so like

208
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:08,380
the shortcut here you know the short

209
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:10,090
answer to what you want to do for SEO is

210
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:12,130
you need to focus on key words no matter

211
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:13,420
what you do with your website you want

212
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:16,060
to make sure that you have particular

213
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:18,130
sets of words usually you know two two

214
00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:20,380
for two two for fries you know two to

215
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:23,410
four words and lengths that will use

216
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:24,850
search engines will index and find them

217
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:25,720
and then you'll rank for those

218
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,190
particular search terms so it depends if

219
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:29,020
you have like an alpaca farm or if

220
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:30,310
you're doing like website design and

221
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:32,110
development or if you're selling some

222
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:35,080
sort of widget and you might ask how do

223
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,190
you know what sort of keywords to target

224
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:37,600
well the first thing you want to do is

225
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:40,240
probably copy your competitors just go

226
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,680
take a look at their websites go look at

227
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,900
their source and take a look at what it

228
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:44,860
is they're trying to sell if you're

229
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:46,420
competing with them use the same

230
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:47,770
keywords but maybe put them in your site

231
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:49,660
more often and as I mentioned two to

232
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:51,010
four words and length is about the

233
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:53,050
optimal length that these search engines

234
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:55,240
are looking for another thing you want

235
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,410
to do is probably have a good domain

236
00:07:56,410 --> 00:07:59,130
name it should also have keywords in it

237
00:07:59,130 --> 00:08:01,060
important thing is that search engines

238
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:02,890
will actually rank sites hosted on your

239
00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:04,450
own domain a lot higher than if you're a

240
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:06,700
subdomain or if you're on a free site

241
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:09,160
place like Angel Fire geocities you want

242
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:11,410
to get off that and afford your own

243
00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:13,840
domain so here's an example of a domain

244
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,070
rights okay this one's pretty good

245
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:17,260
there's a new millennium web design com

246
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:18,760
maybe your keyword is web design so

247
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,260
you're going to rank okay with that but

248
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:21,220
you can still do a little bit better

249
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:22,540
right like you might as well since

250
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:24,280
there's no limit on how long a domain

251
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:25,740
name can be just like stuff it in there

252
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:28,510
but I mean don't stop right like I think

253
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:30,940
enthusiasm is important so so I think

254
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:32,110
that bottom one is going to be pretty

255
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:33,310
good i've got oakland in there right

256
00:08:33,310 --> 00:08:34,479
because you want to get some local

257
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:35,680
ranking as well this is about the time

258
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:37,300
that google locals started to be a thing

259
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:40,030
so then the next most important thing is

260
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:40,840
i feel like i'm kind of going like

261
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,460
outward into the website here we want to

262
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:43,510
start looking at the mark-up we look at

263
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:45,280
the title tag I mean the title tag is

264
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,810
sort of the way that the search engine

265
00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:48,400
knows like semantically like what the

266
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,840
topic of your site is so your title tags

267
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:52,210
pretty important so you can kind of see

268
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:52,630
where I'm go

269
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:55,900
with this just you know just just just

270
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:57,400
just be creative with it and you'll

271
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:00,640
you'll be okay and then also the same

272
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,890
thing applies to your URL structure so

273
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:04,780
you might start with here just alpaca

274
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:07,270
farm by best alpacas you the best is

275
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:08,920
important because you don't want people

276
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:10,660
to miss you know miss miss miss guess

277
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:12,490
and think that you're selling the worst

278
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:13,980
alpacas that happens to me all the time

279
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:16,810
and you can again see where I'm going

280
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:21,880
with this now this one this one is

281
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,890
really important meta tags and some of

282
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:25,570
you might not know but meta tag is

283
00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:27,460
actually the origin of the slang that's

284
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:30,340
so meta that came out in like the early

285
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:32,140
2000 so when someone is actually saying

286
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:33,430
you know that's so meta they're actually

287
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:35,860
referring to meta tags but what people

288
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:37,270
actually don't know about meta tags is

289
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:38,500
that meta tag is actually short for

290
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,300
metaphysical tags because they describe

291
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:42,040
like ghosts and stuff like that they

292
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,930
also describe the description and the

293
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:45,400
keywords for your website and they're

294
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,140
really really the most important thing

295
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:49,600
for ranking on search engines or but

296
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,220
maybe not this is another quote from an

297
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:53,530
SEO website circa 2000 with the wrong

298
00:09:53,530 --> 00:09:55,390
meta tag you can make it to the bottom

299
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:57,820
but meta tags alone do not take you to

300
00:09:57,820 --> 00:09:59,500
the top everywhere now if anybody can

301
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:00,790
tell me what that means please find me

302
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:01,690
afterwards because to me it means

303
00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:03,280
nothing but that's like some real advice

304
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:06,670
out there for your for SEO so I mean

305
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:09,940
there's the description tag and you can

306
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:11,560
just you can put a you know obviously a

307
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:13,060
description of what content is there and

308
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:15,610
then you've also got the keywords tag

309
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:16,960
which you can put some keywords and it's

310
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:19,060
pretty simple and at this point I'm

311
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:20,920
going to ask Jen to passing my phone

312
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,510
over there for this next bit because I

313
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:24,750
need to do a dramatic reading for you

314
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,830
and so there's there's a bunch of

315
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:28,000
different meta tags that allow you to

316
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,500
specify information about ghosts and

317
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,390
your website and there's one in

318
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:33,490
particular called the meta refresh tag

319
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:35,410
that you can actually use to well

320
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:37,120
refresh and redirect your site which

321
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,770
nobody really use anymore because that's

322
00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:42,220
dumb and before I'm we wanted that

323
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:43,690
actually I wanted to mention that this

324
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:45,070
is actually what you should be going for

325
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:46,420
with your keyword you can see their

326
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:48,070
imaginary restaurant website is the best

327
00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:49,540
imaginary restaurant website our

328
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:50,680
restaurant is better than any restaurant

329
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:52,120
and I'm pretty sure that the search

330
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:55,150
robots will will love that you can also

331
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:57,610
stuff the the no script tag this was

332
00:10:57,610 --> 00:10:59,470
some advice on a site that talked about

333
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:01,660
different colored hats they're really

334
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:03,160
into like golf hats black hats in

335
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,960
particular I don't really know what's up

336
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,430
with that but they did mention that you

337
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:08,920
can stuff keywords in the no script tag

338
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:11,110
and also in like HTML comments which i'm

339
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:12,399
pretty sure search engines ignore but i

340
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:15,180
like give them points for creativity

341
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:17,860
excuse me um so yeah so back to the meta

342
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:20,890
meta refresh tag i found this really

343
00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:22,510
fantastic advice and i want to share it

344
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:25,029
with you another more creative use of

345
00:11:25,029 --> 00:11:27,520
the refresh tag is a fancy intro to a

346
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,709
site say you wanted the page to write

347
00:11:29,709 --> 00:11:32,500
welcome and then after one second get

348
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,510
ready and after one more second it

349
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:37,209
should say for a special experience and

350
00:11:37,209 --> 00:11:40,180
finally after a few seconds the real

351
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:42,010
page would be loaded because that's

352
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:43,810
right in two thousand people still had

353
00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:45,670
intro landing pages to their website

354
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:47,560
probably with flash intros and that was

355
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:52,510
a thing Wow okay so yeah this slide

356
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:54,370

357
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:55,600
not a up on my part this is

358
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,029
actually legit slide it didn't forget to

359
00:11:58,029 --> 00:12:01,029
put something here because there were

360
00:12:01,029 --> 00:12:02,980
places that you can put keywords that

361
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:04,480
people don't even have to see so that's

362
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,690
right and you should so holy cow what's

363
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:11,589
going on here white text on a white

364
00:12:11,589 --> 00:12:13,390
background ladies and gentlemen all

365
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:16,060
right also try display none by just like

366
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:17,709
you know on on some elements somewhere i

367
00:12:17,709 --> 00:12:19,240
display none work in two thousand

368
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,260
actually didn't check that anyway

369
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:22,660
doesn't matter and text indent minus you

370
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:24,310
know a bazillion percent so that the

371
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:25,870
text can be seen by the search engine

372
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,850
but not by you and I don't know I feel

373
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:28,870
really bad for people with screen

374
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:30,550
readers around this time of SEO

375
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:34,630
advancement really so one thing I want

376
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:36,130
to mention is don't use frames not only

377
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:37,930
is it super 1990s but it makes it very

378
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:39,490
difficult for websites to index your

379
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:43,000
search engine or wait a minute and flash

380
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,470
well I mean you could probably use flash

381
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:45,790
but just keyword stuff around you now

382
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:47,200
know how to put stuff in there and have

383
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,120
it be totally invisible basically right

384
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,310
so that's pretty good java applets I

385
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:52,329
don't know why you'd still be using

386
00:12:52,329 --> 00:12:53,770
those but I mean that's pretty fun games

387
00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:55,750
out there but again you can you know the

388
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:57,130
drill you can just sort of keyword stuff

389
00:12:57,130 --> 00:13:00,040
around it so now I mean that's a little

390
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,329
bit stuff to do with your markup like I

391
00:13:01,329 --> 00:13:03,070
actually spent a whole lot of time going

392
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:03,910
through the Google search results

393
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:07,270
between 1999 and 2002 i padded a little

394
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:08,740
brown 2000 so I could get creative

395
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:10,990
looking at old websites on an advice and

396
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:12,459
I'm actually convinced that in order to

397
00:13:12,459 --> 00:13:14,079
be an SEO marketing expert in year two

398
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:15,339
thousand you basically just had to like

399
00:13:15,339 --> 00:13:17,860
you know how to write same HTML so why

400
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:19,540
didn't I cash in geez I'm

401
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:21,070
you basically now are all SEO experts

402
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:22,120
and that's all you need to know about

403
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,500
the topic when it comes to like on

404
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,660
on-page optimization someone talk to me

405
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:27,339
about like quality of content and stuff

406
00:13:27,339 --> 00:13:29,829
but I don't know about that so show a

407
00:13:29,829 --> 00:13:31,959
link building is the process of getting

408
00:13:31,959 --> 00:13:33,820
people to link to your page so that's

409
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:35,589
when Google sees your page link to a lot

410
00:13:35,589 --> 00:13:37,750
or altavista yahoo or the other you know

411
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:40,930
super relevant search engines they you

412
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:42,370
know it will know that like Oh a lot of

413
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:43,870
people are linking to this resource that

414
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:45,639
must be really reputable okay sure

415
00:13:45,639 --> 00:13:48,490
that's great web rings obviously are a

416
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:50,230
way to do that although I think as of

417
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:51,670
two thousand web rings are sort of sadly

418
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:53,440
going out of vogue you also asked to

419
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,870
trade links with other websites you can

420
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:57,610
just email them be like hey it doesn't

421
00:13:57,610 --> 00:13:58,810
matter if there were later not just

422
00:13:58,810 --> 00:14:00,190
write a really convincing email me like

423
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:01,839
hey I know that your website is about

424
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:04,029
all pack of farming but I have this

425
00:14:04,029 --> 00:14:05,380
great web design thing do you want to

426
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:07,029
trade links because i'm pretty sure that

427
00:14:07,029 --> 00:14:08,560
an inbound link from alpaca farms to

428
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:09,790
your web development firm is going to

429
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:11,579
give you the google juice right there

430
00:14:11,579 --> 00:14:14,350
again you could buy links that's super

431
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:17,050
legit and definitely whenever you post

432
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:19,029
somewhere I'd comment or review make

433
00:14:19,029 --> 00:14:20,529
sure you put your website because even

434
00:14:20,529 --> 00:14:21,759
though you're posting on a band review

435
00:14:21,759 --> 00:14:23,410
website people definitely need to know

436
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:25,060
about your alpaca farm right like you

437
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:26,260
just never know someone could be both

438
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:29,019
like a good charlotte's enthusiast and

439
00:14:29,019 --> 00:14:31,149
also like be an alpaca breeder right

440
00:14:31,149 --> 00:14:32,860
like people are not just one-dimensional

441
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:35,110
you know like there's depth there so you

442
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:36,069
just got to give them the benefit of the

443
00:14:36,069 --> 00:14:37,180
doubt you should just put yourself out

444
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:41,079
there so in conclusion SEO is really

445
00:14:41,079 --> 00:14:43,600
hilarious nonsense I mean I think for

446
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,160
real talk right like in real life and

447
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,750
2014 I was actually looking like okay so

448
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:48,130
now that I've done this really great

449
00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:49,480
blast from the past thing where I look

450
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:52,990
at all SEO from 2000 I Forbes magazine

451
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:56,319
publishes SEO articles for 2014 talking

452
00:14:56,319 --> 00:14:58,690
about SEO strategy so it's still people

453
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:00,279
think it's a legit thing I would argue

454
00:15:00,279 --> 00:15:02,019
its auxiliary to good content strategy

455
00:15:02,019 --> 00:15:03,519
and the rest of your marketing but this

456
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:06,430
has been a lot of fun so in conclusion I

457
00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:08,439
hope that this will help get you from

458
00:15:08,439 --> 00:15:10,389
the left side of the graph to the right

459
00:15:10,389 --> 00:15:12,430
side with a smiley face that's what I'm

460
00:15:12,430 --> 00:15:14,199
looking for always smiley faces and

461
00:15:14,199 --> 00:15:17,590
that's it thanks
