00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:08,420

[Music]

2
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:11,580
cold today my talks about it's called

3
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:13,469
serious gaming it's kind of about

4
00:00:13,469 --> 00:00:15,210
building educational games and

5
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:18,690
JavaScript has anybody here ever built a

6
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:21,380
game in JavaScript even just for fun

7
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:24,029
cool there was like 10 people in the

8
00:00:24,029 --> 00:00:25,730
audience that had done it it's fun

9
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:28,380
there's there's one guy going crazy so

10
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:31,230
it's good he sounds like he had some fun

11
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:33,360
with it yeah so kind of the main things

12
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:34,800
that I want to talk to you today is

13
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,899
about it's kind of a journey how over a

14
00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:39,260
weekend I became a game developer and

15
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:41,910
how you guys too can become game

16
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:45,140
developers and make games for learning I

17
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:47,489
think I think there's not enough games

18
00:00:47,489 --> 00:00:51,899
for actually learning stuff so about two

19
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:55,140
years ago I moved to Thailand and I

20
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:57,120
never spoke Thai I didn't know how to

21
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,969
read or write Thai I don't know anybody

22
00:00:59,969 --> 00:01:02,550
here know how to read Thai there's like

23
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:04,470
two three okay there's a couple people

24
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:08,040
cool so I came and I come to this new

25
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:10,200
country and I'm like okay I'm gonna make

26
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,360
some friends and I want to start talking

27
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:15,990
to people and nowadays nobody calls each

28
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:17,670
other right we don't talk on the phone

29
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:19,830
we're always on like whatsapp or line or

30
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:23,100
Kakao chat or whatever and what I found

31
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:28,020
was I I wanted to talk to people and my

32
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:30,119
conversations always ended up like this

33
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:34,049
where you have these here - yeah where

34
00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:36,329
all we do is we just send stickers to

35
00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:38,670
each other like okay this is great like

36
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:41,549
okay I'm hungry I'm sad you know and you

37
00:01:41,549 --> 00:01:43,560
can kind of get some of the way with

38
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,659
stickers but I really wanted to like

39
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:49,189
learn how to write and like how to type

40
00:01:49,189 --> 00:01:53,610
so what ended up happening was I just

41
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:55,290
like you know what I'm a programmer why

42
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:57,439
don't I just make a game to make myself

43
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:00,899
be able to learn Thai so I actually

44
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:03,840
built a Thai typing game well I first

45
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,399
went on the internet and there's been

46
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:07,049
like two typing games made in the last

47
00:02:07,049 --> 00:02:09,360
ten years and they're both awful and I

48
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,509
was like I just can't be

49
00:02:10,509 --> 00:02:14,049
hard oh why do i why don't I try this

50
00:02:14,049 --> 00:02:18,159
out if you guys have ever seen well this

51
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:19,500
is actually a picture of the game so

52
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:23,200
this is a copy of the game on iOS it's a

53
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,390
pretty simple game but it's it's kind of

54
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:27,280
a lot of fun and just a really quick way

55
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,250
to like incrementally grow tie and and

56
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:32,230
learn a keyboard and you may be asking

57
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:34,569
yourself why why is it difficult why why

58
00:02:34,569 --> 00:02:36,159
would you go through all this trouble of

59
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:38,650
building your own app to like learn how

60
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:40,750
to write Thai well this is the Thai

61
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:43,540
alphabet and that's not two copies of

62
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:47,349
the same keyboard it's two keyboards so

63
00:02:47,349 --> 00:02:49,120
like you literally have to hit the meta

64
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,340
key to get some of the characters right

65
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:54,760
so like when I started typing I wasn't

66
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:56,829
hunting and pecking I was like sitting

67
00:02:56,829 --> 00:02:58,750
there for like five minutes like every

68
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:01,629
key press would be like I don't know

69
00:03:01,629 --> 00:03:06,310
where go guy is so I was like oh man

70
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:08,560
this this has to be better it has to be

71
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,090
better it has to be a better way to do

72
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:12,879
this and that's kind of what started my

73
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:17,019
journey building this game so just

74
00:03:17,019 --> 00:03:18,310
really quick a little bit background

75
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:21,790
about me I'm a server-side developer I

76
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:23,889
mostly write go and you might be asking

77
00:03:23,889 --> 00:03:25,480
yourself why is a go developer here

78
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,650
talking about JavaScript

79
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:30,819
I love JavaScript and my main my main

80
00:03:30,819 --> 00:03:33,220
day job is writing server-side code so

81
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:35,799
like it's a nice like weekend thing to

82
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:37,540
write JavaScript particularly front-end

83
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:39,910
stuff you know just kind of totally

84
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:42,489
different element I have a book coming

85
00:03:42,489 --> 00:03:43,959
out later this year called micro

86
00:03:43,959 --> 00:03:46,120
services and go you should check it out

87
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:52,599
and yeah and I live in Bangkok cool how

88
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:58,329
many people here are gamers yeah cool we

89
00:03:58,329 --> 00:03:59,980
have a I figured there would be a lot of

90
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:01,750
people in the audience that are big

91
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:04,090
gamers and you know I mean there's a lot

92
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:06,760
of types of games right there's games

93
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,530
like World of Warcraft where you know

94
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:11,079
you're just you know you're grinding

95
00:04:11,079 --> 00:04:13,329
you're doing things and people play

96
00:04:13,329 --> 00:04:14,979
World of Warcraft because it's fun it's

97
00:04:14,979 --> 00:04:16,870
social they get into it and like they

98
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:19,180
play with their friends but there's like

99
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:22,150
this huge spectrum of kinds of games so

100
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:23,000
I

101
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,890
I don't know if this game was really big

102
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:27,260
in Singapore but it's the number one

103
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:29,000
game in Thailand and it's it's a

104
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,060
Japanese cat game it's called neko

105
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:36,590
atsume and all you do is you put stuff

106
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:40,100
around and you collect cats and people

107
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:42,440
spend hours playing this game and what's

108
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:44,720
crazy is there's no time it's only in

109
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,440
Japanese

110
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,940
there's no English subtitles or anything

111
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:48,440
but people have learned how to play this

112
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,570
game just because they think that it's

113
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:52,910
really fun and you'll see people on the

114
00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:55,940
subway in Thailand almost spend like 30

115
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:58,070
minutes just playing this game and it

116
00:04:58,070 --> 00:05:01,100
blows my mind and this game the only

117
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:02,750
thing I can think of it's just for time

118
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:08,680
wasting but I want to talk about it

119
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:11,660
something that I really what I'm really

120
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:13,220
passionate about which is serious gaming

121
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:16,730
and serious gaming is is building

122
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:20,090
educational games for learning whereas

123
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:22,700
like when we when you know when we're

124
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:24,620
taught math as a kid you know like we do

125
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:26,570
our math facts and like we have to like

126
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:28,790
do the questions and the answers and

127
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:30,260
we're like why can't we make this fun

128
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:32,060
instead of just giving somebody a gold

129
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:34,220
sticker like why can't we actually make

130
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:37,190
an interactive game that like helps

131
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:39,560
people like learn how to do math or how

132
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,630
to read or do these kinds of things

133
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:45,200
right and so when I was growing up we

134
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:48,050
had we had like Atari two's which I mean

135
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:50,330
Apple two's excuse me and we had lots of

136
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:52,400
really fun educational games and I don't

137
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,870
know what's happened because I feel like

138
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:56,350
they've kind of gone away and in a sense

139
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:58,460
so like when I was growing up I don't

140
00:05:58,460 --> 00:05:59,600
know it has anybody played any of these

141
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,690
games by the way yeah okay people

142
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:03,890
there's some older people here in the

143
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:05,120
audience these these are really old

144
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:09,169
though there's like Oregon Trail and

145
00:06:09,169 --> 00:06:12,229
Carmen Sandiego and math blasters and

146
00:06:12,229 --> 00:06:14,060
the best one my favorite one was always

147
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:16,190
number munchers and it was just a game

148
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:18,200
that taught you multiplication in

149
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,570
addition but you didn't think it was a

150
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:22,460
game you just played it because it was

151
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:24,169
fun and then all of a sudden you knew

152
00:06:24,169 --> 00:06:26,810
all your multiplication tables it was

153
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:30,020
really kind of a crazy idea and but

154
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:32,030
there was like tons of these games and

155
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:34,340
they were really easy like these ran on

156
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:36,110
like one megahertz computer

157
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:38,680
it's like why can't we on the web now

158
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:41,569
remit games like this for kids like why

159
00:06:41,569 --> 00:06:44,180
can't we make it fun for kids and people

160
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:49,219
to learn things and there's this kind of

161
00:06:49,219 --> 00:06:51,680
other area of gaming is gamification I

162
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,849
know a lot of people probably build

163
00:06:52,849 --> 00:06:54,229
business apps does anybody here use

164
00:06:54,229 --> 00:06:56,650
gamification like in their apps at all

165
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:59,000
not many actually just three or four

166
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,419
people okay so Gama fication is kind of

167
00:07:02,419 --> 00:07:03,860
like this thing that's come out over the

168
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:06,439
last years and I don't think is as

169
00:07:06,439 --> 00:07:08,270
effective at education but basically

170
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:11,719
Gama fication is we want to give rewards

171
00:07:11,719 --> 00:07:13,490
we want to give points we want to like

172
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:16,159
you check in you become a mayor like we

173
00:07:16,159 --> 00:07:17,810
have an app in America called Foursquare

174
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:19,190
where you check in and you become a

175
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:22,400
mayor of a building and it's all around

176
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:29,029
points and games and I feel like it's

177
00:07:29,029 --> 00:07:31,490
fun but at a certain point if your bank

178
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:33,289
website gives you points for like

179
00:07:33,289 --> 00:07:34,909
checking your checking account at a

180
00:07:34,909 --> 00:07:36,259
certain point you're just going to get

181
00:07:36,259 --> 00:07:38,029
really bored with getting points on

182
00:07:38,029 --> 00:07:41,000
every single thing that you do and it's

183
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,979
really cool so I mean we do some of

184
00:07:42,979 --> 00:07:44,270
these kinds of things like you know you

185
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:46,490
still want to have like level ups and

186
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:48,199
points and being able to show share to

187
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:51,379
your friends but I really think the

188
00:07:51,379 --> 00:07:53,360
future of educational gaming is about

189
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,190
making the games fun how do we make a

190
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:58,310
world of warcraft that that teaches you

191
00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:00,289
how to do geography or something like

192
00:08:00,289 --> 00:08:02,719
this like that that's what I really

193
00:08:02,719 --> 00:08:06,589
would like to see and and and the whole

194
00:08:06,589 --> 00:08:08,300
reason and obviously this is java

195
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:10,810
circumference so yes I am gonna get to

196
00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:14,719
actual JavaScript programming so why

197
00:08:14,719 --> 00:08:17,690
JavaScript has has everybody read this

198
00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:19,039
book by the way javascript the good

199
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:21,979
parts come on there should be more

200
00:08:21,979 --> 00:08:23,150
people in the audience this is

201
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:25,069
absolutely the most important book

202
00:08:25,069 --> 00:08:26,659
you'll ever read on Java scale of

203
00:08:26,659 --> 00:08:28,580
analysis which guy and I look this is

204
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:32,750
like one book that I love but why did I

205
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:35,000
pick JavaScript like you know like I've

206
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,789
done C++ a ton C sharp I've done all the

207
00:08:37,789 --> 00:08:40,070
stuff I could write a native app and I

208
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:42,560
and I thought about it and I was like

209
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:44,089
well I wanted to build this in a weekend

210
00:08:44,089 --> 00:08:46,130
I wanted to just do this without any

211
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:48,040
trouble and just

212
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:50,740
wanted to do it fast and I was like this

213
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:52,660
is really the reason I did in JavaScript

214
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:55,930
is because every time I make a change in

215
00:08:55,930 --> 00:08:58,769
my code that the app just reloads itself

216
00:08:58,769 --> 00:09:01,449
it's like interactive programming it's

217
00:09:01,449 --> 00:09:03,670
kind of like what they've always talked

218
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:05,889
about and having a good IDE is like um

219
00:09:05,889 --> 00:09:08,170
as I'm changing the code I like I have a

220
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:10,089
bigger monitor at home so I literally

221
00:09:10,089 --> 00:09:12,910
just keep the app on one side and I keep

222
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:14,290
the JavaScript on the other and every

223
00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:16,690
time my editor saves I actually use this

224
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:19,540
thing called I use this thing called

225
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:21,730
browser sync I don't know is anybody

226
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:23,769
here use browser sync or something

227
00:09:23,769 --> 00:09:24,190
similar

228
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:27,040
that's okay so this table over here is

229
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,420
like they raise their hand for

230
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:29,649
everything so they're probably very

231
00:09:29,649 --> 00:09:31,180
advanced or they like raising their

232
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:36,759
hands yeah so browser sync in gulp you

233
00:09:36,759 --> 00:09:37,779
should really check it out because

234
00:09:37,779 --> 00:09:40,060
basically for like 10 lines of code you

235
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:42,550
can point it at your your asset folders

236
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:44,529
and I even do like asset compilation

237
00:09:44,529 --> 00:09:46,000
even if you're doing CoffeeScript or

238
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,490
whatever it will automatically just

239
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:50,079
reload the browser and what's cool is

240
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:52,660
that it actually inserts JavaScript into

241
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:55,540
your HTML page and that javascript has

242
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:57,940
like notifications so like if something

243
00:09:57,940 --> 00:09:59,170
changes on the file system it actually

244
00:09:59,170 --> 00:10:01,180
pings the code in the browser and

245
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:03,519
reloads the browser so like if you're

246
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:05,740
building a game what I do is I just like

247
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:07,630
disable all the menus and all this stuff

248
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:09,310
and I always just have the game levels

249
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:13,180
pop up so like as you're coding you're

250
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:16,240
like oh no that the the character he's

251
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,579
like 10 pixels too high well let me

252
00:10:18,579 --> 00:10:20,560
change the 10 pixels and literally like

253
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,149
in a second you'll see that the 10

254
00:10:22,149 --> 00:10:24,190
pixels come down you know it's not like

255
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:25,839
if you guys have built like a game in

256
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:28,630
like C++ you're like okay well now I'm

257
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:31,660
gonna like recompile the whole thing and

258
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:34,000
I'm gonna wait five minutes and oh no I

259
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,860
didn't get it it wasn't 10 pixels it was

260
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:38,399
actually 12 pixels off stuff like this

261
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:41,680
so I think that was one of the biggest

262
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,959
things that like JavaScript there's no

263
00:10:43,959 --> 00:10:45,339
way I could have built this game in like

264
00:10:45,339 --> 00:10:46,959
three days the first version was

265
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:54,819
literally three days like so so this has

266
00:10:54,819 --> 00:10:56,410
kind of always been my sticking point

267
00:10:56,410 --> 00:10:58,300
about JavaScript I don't know does

268
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:00,069
anybody hear fine like JavaScript

269
00:11:00,069 --> 00:11:01,340
projects get pretty messy

270
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:03,350
if they get really large like it just

271
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:05,330
kind of comes like this big bald mod of

272
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:07,820
chaos a lot of times and like all of a

273
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:09,170
sudden you're in like this class and

274
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:10,790
it's actually attaching something to the

275
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:13,310
window that's used in like six classes

276
00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:15,560
away and nobody knows because it was

277
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:18,110
written five years ago and like and this

278
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:19,700
has always been like my pain whenever

279
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:20,990
I've come into a lot of JavaScript

280
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:24,320
projects and I'm sure a lot of people

281
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,570
here are using it but I use this tool

282
00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:30,110
called requirejs and requirejs lets you

283
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:32,510
do is like you make sure that each class

284
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:35,600
is kind of very separate and you kind of

285
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,370
you can you can kind of separate your

286
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:39,560
different parts of the code very cleanly

287
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:42,740
so for a game games come out pretty

288
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:45,200
cleanly so like you know the hero is a

289
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,930
distinct class you know each monster is

290
00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:50,210
a distinct class you know each kind of

291
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:54,440
level is a class even things like the

292
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:56,300
kinds of labels that we have like we

293
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:58,190
have special like scoring labels and

294
00:11:58,190 --> 00:12:01,160
stuff like this and it really kind of

295
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,390
gave you a really nice way of

296
00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:06,200
structuring the whole program so it felt

297
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,580
a little bit more like being a

298
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:09,500
structured language like C++ or I'd you

299
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:12,710
go and and but still got to a lot of the

300
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:18,700
speed and development of JavaScript so I

301
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:21,110
don't know if anybody's here if you've

302
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:23,510
looked at JavaScript game development

303
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:25,460
libraries when it when it came into this

304
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:29,420
project I was like all right there has

305
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:31,670
to be nice game development library in

306
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:34,250
JavaScript so of course I go on Google

307
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:39,110
and I look and there's only 300 so this

308
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:42,230
should be easy to pick from so I think I

309
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:44,300
got by by about the third one I was just

310
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:46,040
like all right I think it's just faster

311
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:49,340
just to pick it and start programming so

312
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:51,680
I don't have like a huge extensive

313
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,330
knowledge of all of them I tried a

314
00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:55,820
couple like impact GS but it ended up

315
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:58,490
with this one called create GS and

316
00:12:58,490 --> 00:13:00,320
what's kind of cool is it's written by

317
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,360
some guys that used to do flash this guy

318
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:06,050
game G Skinner and since he was a flash

319
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:07,910
developer he kind of had all the ideas

320
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:09,890
about what are the core elements of like

321
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:12,170
building interactive applications you

322
00:13:12,170 --> 00:13:14,330
know like you know like how do I make

323
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:15,120
things anime

324
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,370
how do I have like transitions how do I

325
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:20,310
have tweens and and just really just

326
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:23,220
very small core building blocks it

327
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:24,779
doesn't try to be like I don't know if

328
00:13:24,779 --> 00:13:26,220
you've seen other game libraries where

329
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:27,839
they're like you know you end up just

330
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:30,690
making JSON files to control levels or

331
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:33,300
if you use like unity maybe you like try

332
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:35,400
to like use some GUI app like it's it's

333
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,260
just like the bear kind of fundamentals

334
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:41,400
that you would need and since not a lot

335
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,990
of people have actually built games here

336
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:45,750
I'm gonna kind of talk about really the

337
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:48,950
small fundamentals of building a game

338
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:52,320
just a 2-d game you know this is like

339
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,960
all Mario area stuff so like it's not

340
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:57,360
advanced and it's really easy and it's

341
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:01,260
kind of fun so kind of the one of the

342
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:02,970
the main building blocks of a game is

343
00:14:02,970 --> 00:14:05,580
you have that animations right so we

344
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:07,320
have you know we have monsters in the

345
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,029
game and we have the characters and

346
00:14:09,029 --> 00:14:10,920
basically what boils down is you have

347
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,240
these things and they're called sprite

348
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,390
sheets you know they can be cells or

349
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:17,610
whatever but basically what happens is

350
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:20,790
you have like a giant horizontal image

351
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:23,070
so like each one of these five things

352
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:26,400
here is one image and basically you

353
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,650
break down the frames of the image into

354
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:30,990
like separate blocks so if it's by 40 by

355
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:32,670
40 you're lining it up and you say like

356
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:35,400
40 and then at 80 pixels there's the

357
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,950
second pixel picture and at 120 pixels

358
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:43,320
there's a third picture right so as you

359
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,600
do these but what's also cool is you

360
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,250
might have multiple different animations

361
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:48,870
in one file so like if we look at the

362
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:51,510
monster there we have we have two we

363
00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:53,730
have two animations we have one where

364
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:56,070
he's like chomping and then we have one

365
00:14:56,070 --> 00:15:00,630
where he's dying and and we look at the

366
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:02,700
each of them we have like but sometimes

367
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:05,160
we might so not whereas like on the

368
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:07,110
third one down we just have one long

369
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:11,490
really really long animation so we can

370
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:14,029
kind of mix these up how we want and

371
00:15:14,029 --> 00:15:16,560
what's kind of cool is the code is

372
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:19,890
really easy for this so like we're

373
00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:21,570
looking at the monster we're actually

374
00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:25,860
looking at one of the monkeys and in the

375
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:27,329
framework all you're doing is you're

376
00:15:27,329 --> 00:15:28,680
defining which frames go

377
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:33,750
each animation so you say like frames 0

378
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:37,350
1 2 3 4 5 go to the run and you can even

379
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:39,180
reuse them so sometimes maybe the jump

380
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:41,279
share some of the run animations and

381
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:43,380
then you can just and you just set up

382
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:47,310
names and then we just create a hero

383
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:50,339
with the sprite sheet and you place them

384
00:15:50,339 --> 00:15:51,990
on the screen and that's as simple as

385
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:54,149
creating animations and when you want to

386
00:15:54,149 --> 00:15:55,500
play it so like let's say that we're

387
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,779
playing through the game and we kill the

388
00:15:57,779 --> 00:16:01,440
monster right to actually just kill the

389
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,810
monster to run the animation you run one

390
00:16:03,810 --> 00:16:06,630
line of code and it's just it's called

391
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:08,459
go to and stop so it runs the animation

392
00:16:08,459 --> 00:16:10,140
and us to the end of the animation and

393
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:13,050
it's that simple like it's 15 lines of

394
00:16:13,050 --> 00:16:15,480
code to set up an animation and to place

395
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:17,160
it on the screen and then one line of

396
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:19,080
code every time you want to play it so

397
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:21,630
it's it's about as simple as it can get

398
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:23,940
and and that's kind of one of the things

399
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:26,430
that I want to kind of convey through

400
00:16:26,430 --> 00:16:28,920
this whole thing is basically it's

401
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:31,140
pretty easy like it seems daunting like

402
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:32,970
you see games and like you don't have to

403
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:35,670
make like 3d unreal game like there's a

404
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:37,770
lot of fun two teams it's like the cat

405
00:16:37,770 --> 00:16:39,300
game we showed earlier it isn't it

406
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:41,430
there's no like advanced technology that

407
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:42,570
could have been made on a Super Nintendo

408
00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:47,459
you know so kind of the next building

409
00:16:47,459 --> 00:16:50,910
block that we have in kind of 2d and 2d

410
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:51,990
game programming it's called the

411
00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:54,330
parallax scrolling and this is kind of

412
00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:55,860
like if you ever played Super Mario

413
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:57,900
Brothers I don't know is how many people

414
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:59,760
I don't know if that's too old in this

415
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,800
audience okay okay cool

416
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,180
actually half more than half the

417
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:06,179
audiences play this good so basically

418
00:17:06,179 --> 00:17:09,959
the whole idea of Super Mario is Mario

419
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:11,579
doesn't really move that much it's

420
00:17:11,579 --> 00:17:13,740
really the background of the screen that

421
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:15,449
moves so I just want to really quickly

422
00:17:15,449 --> 00:17:17,760
show so like this is actually the game

423
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:20,459
right so like this is this is actually

424
00:17:20,459 --> 00:17:22,470
all those elements put together inside

425
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:24,929
of one of the levels in the game but if

426
00:17:24,929 --> 00:17:26,850
we break it down into pieces it's really

427
00:17:26,850 --> 00:17:28,740
four different graphics that are really

428
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:31,860
wide and kind of the idea with a

429
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:34,350
parallax is that you have different

430
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:36,870
parts of the screen and they move at

431
00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:39,900
different speeds so the clouds might be

432
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:41,830
moving really slow

433
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:43,540
the city scene might be moving very

434
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:45,460
quickly and then the middle city scene

435
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:47,080
might be moving just a little bit slower

436
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:49,660
and then the ground just barely moves

437
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:52,720
right and it creates this effect as

438
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,580
though you're walking through the screen

439
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:55,960
but all you're doing is you're just kind

440
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,460
of you're just shifting different

441
00:17:57,460 --> 00:17:59,590
elements and what's kind of cool is that

442
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:01,480
it ends up being like a circle so like

443
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:04,030
the clouds we don't have infinite number

444
00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:05,550
of clouds right we're just basically

445
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:09,100
circling around a circle so we like are

446
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:11,020
just showing a portion of the clouds at

447
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:12,700
any pour it's important the time so

448
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:15,340
maybe like on this screen here we might

449
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:16,660
be showing maybe a quarter of those

450
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:19,150
clouds especially on iOS where you're

451
00:18:19,150 --> 00:18:20,320
not gonna you don't have that much

452
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,210
resolution so you as you can see we're

453
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:24,730
only seeing like a very very very small

454
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:26,980
fraction of each piece but it kind of

455
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:29,260
moves around and it kind of gives the

456
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:31,120
impression is that that you're really

457
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:36,130
kind of moving through this city soon so

458
00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:39,160
let's let's talk about the code and once

459
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:42,640
again this is really easy so basically

460
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:46,360
for parallax you basically are just for

461
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:49,000
each one you give it a name you give it

462
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,840
the dimensions and you give it the speed

463
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:55,120
the rate that it's going to be moving so

464
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:58,470
some are going to be moving at you know

465
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:01,840
point so many milliseconds and each one

466
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,370
will be moving at different milliseconds

467
00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:06,400
and then the actual implementation of

468
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,410
parallax itself is only ten lines of

469
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:11,290
code in JavaScript you're basically just

470
00:19:11,290 --> 00:19:14,860
taking the velocity and you're basically

471
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:17,320
just moving it around the x-axis at the

472
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:20,050
velocity that it needs to go so like and

473
00:19:20,050 --> 00:19:22,570
if it loops around we just start over

474
00:19:22,570 --> 00:19:25,330
from the beginning so it's it's it's

475
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:27,970
really really easy it didn't even have a

476
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:29,800
parallax implementation I just got this

477
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,210
off the internet I was like ten lines of

478
00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:33,700
code it was it it's it's really fun

479
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:37,420
though so now we have kind of the main

480
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:39,460
building blocks of like a 2d game like

481
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:41,680
we can we have the characters we can

482
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:44,140
make big characters animate and move and

483
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:45,580
we can move the background as though

484
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:47,860
we're walking through the screen now how

485
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:49,750
does the main game loop work in a game

486
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:53,440
so kind of games are kind of built

487
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,460
around state machines

488
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:58,760
so basically what happens is every time

489
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:00,890
there's a clock tick so usually you'll

490
00:20:00,890 --> 00:20:02,720
divide a game into like 60 frames a

491
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:05,210
second or 30 frames a second and you'll

492
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:07,070
have an event which is your clock tick

493
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:09,530
in create yes they called the update

494
00:20:09,530 --> 00:20:13,700
function and once every so like if we

495
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:16,280
have 60 frames a second so once a what

496
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:18,950
once every one 60th of a second will get

497
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:22,040
an event and basically what we'll do is

498
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:24,470
we'll decide at that point in time if we

499
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:26,450
need to do an animation or maybe we need

500
00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:28,640
to scroll the screen some and and

501
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,050
basically we're just doing it a

502
00:20:30,050 --> 00:20:32,150
fractions fractions in fractions of a

503
00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:36,710
second and the main game loop as you can

504
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:38,150
see here you can maybe I can't see the

505
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:41,540
code gray but it's only maybe about 50

506
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:42,920
lines of code and we'll just kind of

507
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,300
talk through just kind of the main

508
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:46,760
elements of how how a game loop actually

509
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:50,090
works so like as I said it's a state

510
00:20:50,090 --> 00:20:52,730
machine so like for example if somebody

511
00:20:52,730 --> 00:20:54,650
hit the pause button the function

512
00:20:54,650 --> 00:20:56,480
shouldn't do anything right so it starts

513
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:59,570
there and then if if we're in the middle

514
00:20:59,570 --> 00:21:02,210
of a monster dying so like an event so

515
00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:04,040
like a monster dies well that's not

516
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:05,930
instantaneous right because it may take

517
00:21:05,930 --> 00:21:08,720
a second it may take a half a second for

518
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:11,090
the animation to play through so you

519
00:21:11,090 --> 00:21:12,860
have to keep you have to maintain these

520
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:15,950
states and you have to see if we're if

521
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:18,050
we're done yet with each of these kinds

522
00:21:18,050 --> 00:21:22,520
of states and then for each kind of

523
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:24,740
thing on the screen now it's granted

524
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:26,750
like this is a pretty simple game so

525
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:30,230
like I explicitly mention each monster

526
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:32,300
and each hero like if you're building a

527
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:33,680
bigger game you would have like a linked

528
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:36,830
list or a map of like all of the all the

529
00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:38,300
objects that you would have on the

530
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:39,730
screen and you would iterate over them

531
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:42,050
but basically what you're gonna do is

532
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:44,540
you talk to each object and you tell the

533
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:46,970
object to render itself and and

534
00:21:46,970 --> 00:21:49,880
basically in in like the hero or in the

535
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:53,030
monster they know about time so the hero

536
00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:55,670
he's running so like every so often

537
00:21:55,670 --> 00:21:58,330
he'll be changing frames of his run or

538
00:21:58,330 --> 00:22:01,520
if it's the monster he'll have to be

539
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,890
checking to see if the hero intersects

540
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:07,010
with with the box so like if the monster

541
00:22:07,010 --> 00:22:08,120
and the hero touchy

542
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:11,240
the hero dies shame these kinds of

543
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:13,250
things so each of these classes is like

544
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:16,039
responsible for its own for its own

545
00:22:16,039 --> 00:22:18,529
functionality and it kind of breaks in

546
00:22:18,529 --> 00:22:22,159
like that so then yeah so so and then

547
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:24,559
yes then there's the collided so we

548
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:26,900
might do things we play an audio we

549
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:30,679
might lower the health and for our game

550
00:22:30,679 --> 00:22:33,409
since we're building something that

551
00:22:33,409 --> 00:22:35,440
actually is tracking words per minute

552
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:38,299
we're gonna start calculating the words

553
00:22:38,299 --> 00:22:40,580
per minute and update any labels so like

554
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:43,010
we have labels on the screen if I come

555
00:22:43,010 --> 00:22:46,130
back here we have that's yeah we have

556
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:48,169
labels on the screen like the time the

557
00:22:48,169 --> 00:22:51,080
words per minute how many points we have

558
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:52,730
and we have to kind of keep track of

559
00:22:52,730 --> 00:22:54,380
those and like every time we do an

560
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:57,110
update and then the very last thing is

561
00:22:57,110 --> 00:22:59,360
we iterate over all the parallax layers

562
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:02,659
that we talked about earlier and we we

563
00:23:02,659 --> 00:23:04,279
make sure that they get updated so like

564
00:23:04,279 --> 00:23:06,500
we just talked to the parallax which we

565
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:08,870
talked about here and the parallax knows

566
00:23:08,870 --> 00:23:11,149
how to render itself what's kind of cool

567
00:23:11,149 --> 00:23:12,919
is like the main game loop just kind of

568
00:23:12,919 --> 00:23:15,289
knows about objects and then each object

569
00:23:15,289 --> 00:23:16,730
is kind of responsible for its own

570
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:18,380
rendering it's kind of very similar to

571
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:20,270
like when you guys do like angular or

572
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:21,950
any of these other component frameworks

573
00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:24,500
but now we can do this with like games

574
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:26,720
and it's it's pretty straightforward if

575
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:29,960
you've done any kind of other game

576
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:32,750
development so that's kind of the main

577
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:35,059
glue that's that's basically all the

578
00:23:35,059 --> 00:23:37,130
main things you need to like break down

579
00:23:37,130 --> 00:23:39,320
a game and we've talked about maybe 150

580
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:41,630
lines of code for the core of a 2-d game

581
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:43,940
that's that's pretty reasonable for

582
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:46,039
anybody starting out to just like flip

583
00:23:46,039 --> 00:23:49,370
through right so cool so I'm going to

584
00:23:49,370 --> 00:23:50,720
talk about some of the other cool fun

585
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:53,240
libraries that I found for doing game

586
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:56,000
development with with this there's

587
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,549
another library called creatine and once

588
00:23:58,549 --> 00:24:00,440
you start to get a more complex game

589
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:01,940
like so once I started to have multiple

590
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:03,679
levels and stuff I wanted to be able to

591
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:05,390
like actually manage the levels in a

592
00:24:05,390 --> 00:24:08,330
sane way and this creatine framework

593
00:24:08,330 --> 00:24:10,360
allows you to do like level management

594
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:13,309
transitions between levels it can even

595
00:24:13,309 --> 00:24:15,919
do things like did anybody play like the

596
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:18,049
old Final Fantasies were like you have

597
00:24:18,049 --> 00:24:20,210
like this 2d yeah

598
00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:22,430
plantain yeah I see a couple of people

599
00:24:22,430 --> 00:24:24,680
smiling so like the old Final Fantasy

600
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:26,300
games were all they call it I so more

601
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:28,640
Trek Norfolk where you're looking at a

602
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:31,310
you're looking at an overworld and you

603
00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:33,230
move through this overworld and it has

604
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:34,700
kind of cool things for that so if you

605
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:35,900
guys are like if anybody's thinking

606
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:38,540
about like building like a 3d like not

607
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:41,510
3d but like a like an old-style RPG like

608
00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:43,880
there's classes where like you just spin

609
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:45,530
up and you just give it some graphics

610
00:24:45,530 --> 00:24:46,970
and all of a sudden you have like an

611
00:24:46,970 --> 00:24:48,050
old-style

612
00:24:48,050 --> 00:24:53,330
RPG like right out of the box so I'll

613
00:24:53,330 --> 00:24:55,940
talk about kind of what I ended up using

614
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:58,400
it for I ended up using it for managing

615
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:01,130
levels and what's really cool is like

616
00:25:01,130 --> 00:25:02,900
they have this thing called the level

617
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:05,420
manager in the directory and you

618
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:07,310
basically you set up all your types of

619
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:09,530
levels and you can even make things like

620
00:25:09,530 --> 00:25:11,930
the main the main entry screen to the

621
00:25:11,930 --> 00:25:14,240
application and the settings screen are

622
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,850
kind of levels and you can shift between

623
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:19,400
them so like you can kind of make them

624
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,900
you can almost think of it it's like if

625
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:22,790
it was like divs of different pages and

626
00:25:22,790 --> 00:25:24,920
you're replacing them it just handles

627
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:27,680
like transitioning like like say if we

628
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:29,960
want to transition like ever every after

629
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:32,240
every level you want to have a level

630
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,160
complete right so you want to transition

631
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,570
into a level complete and then

632
00:25:35,570 --> 00:25:37,430
transition into the next type of level

633
00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:39,530
and is this kind of framework just kind

634
00:25:39,530 --> 00:25:41,480
of gives you a really easy way of

635
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:43,400
handling that and keeping that and a

636
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:45,110
nice clean kind of more object-oriented

637
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:48,530
fashion so there was a whole talk on

638
00:25:48,530 --> 00:25:50,300
this which is great I hope everybody

639
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:51,830
heard the talk this morning which was

640
00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:53,900
really great how many people are

641
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:56,780
actually using PhoneGap or cordova for

642
00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:59,060
production stuff that's cool there's

643
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:01,400
actually quite a bit of people yeah it's

644
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:02,600
really exciting like if you haven't

645
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:04,790
checked it out and you might be like

646
00:26:04,790 --> 00:26:07,400
well what why did you build an HTML game

647
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,480
and then why do you need to produce

648
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,950
cordova why don't you just put it on the

649
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:11,150
web wouldn't that be awesome

650
00:26:11,150 --> 00:26:13,250
so I started off and I was like oh this

651
00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:15,920
is awesome I built it on OSX I built the

652
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,360
whole app in a weekend I was like oh

653
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:19,580
this is really cool and I don't really

654
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:22,250
typed I on my OS X I always type on my

655
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:23,450
phone because I'm always talking with my

656
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:25,820
friends if I'm talking inside and I was

657
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:26,900
like ah cool I'm just gonna throw this

658
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:29,510
on iOS it's gonna be no problem like of

659
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:32,210
course I throw it on there in like 95

660
00:26:32,210 --> 00:26:33,180
percent of it work

661
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:35,040
right and it's like this is always the

662
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:36,810
one thing that always is annoying with

663
00:26:36,810 --> 00:26:38,490
JavaScript there's always like that last

664
00:26:38,490 --> 00:26:41,910
couple percent so there was a couple

665
00:26:41,910 --> 00:26:43,470
issues that when I ran to and I

666
00:26:43,470 --> 00:26:45,870
originally put it on iOS so things like

667
00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:49,770
the native keyboard so one of the things

668
00:26:49,770 --> 00:26:51,660
is a lot of typing games if you look on

669
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:52,890
the App Store I don't know if anybody's

670
00:26:52,890 --> 00:26:54,570
ever played they make their own fake

671
00:26:54,570 --> 00:26:56,340
keyboards which is really annoying

672
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:59,310
because I like the iOS keyboard and I

673
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:00,690
really want to learn how to type on that

674
00:27:00,690 --> 00:27:02,010
I don't want to learn how to type on a

675
00:27:02,010 --> 00:27:03,930
fake keyboard so if you want to actually

676
00:27:03,930 --> 00:27:06,810
control the iOS keyboard for good reason

677
00:27:06,810 --> 00:27:09,480
Safari doesn't let you control how it

678
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:12,780
pops up and stuff like this so this is

679
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:14,280
one of the things that you actually have

680
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:17,010
to go to native code for and and

681
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:18,810
actually be able to handle the the

682
00:27:18,810 --> 00:27:22,200
popups the other thing was there were

683
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,060
certain times where the whole game would

684
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:28,140
just pause on iOS in Safari like when

685
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:29,820
you are playing there's like sometimes

686
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:31,470
when you're playing sounds or sometimes

687
00:27:31,470 --> 00:27:33,030
when you're using the keyboard like the

688
00:27:33,030 --> 00:27:34,410
game would just like it would just pause

689
00:27:34,410 --> 00:27:36,360
and there was just like nothing you

690
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:38,760
could do so these were the kinds of

691
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,200
things that like I ended up using

692
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:43,590
Cordova for and ended up being really

693
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:44,880
easy I thought it was gonna be hard

694
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,200
because they were like oh you can build

695
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,970
native code and I hadn't hadn't used it

696
00:27:47,970 --> 00:27:49,950
before and I was like I'll cool I've

697
00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:51,420
done objective-c I'm gonna write all

698
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:52,830
this objective-c and then I go on the

699
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:54,870
internet and I find that everything that

700
00:27:54,870 --> 00:27:56,670
I ever wanted possibly was already

701
00:27:56,670 --> 00:28:00,360
written in Cordova plugins so so you

702
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:01,680
don't have to worry about doing

703
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,510
Objective C or Java if you're doing an

704
00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:06,120
Android app so for example I used two

705
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:09,030
plugins from Cordova one in one of them

706
00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:10,920
is the keyboard plug-in which allows you

707
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,540
to have like manual control of the

708
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:14,460
keyboard so you can actually like force

709
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:17,700
the keyboard to pop up and do things the

710
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:19,050
other really cool thing that they have

711
00:28:19,050 --> 00:28:22,410
in Cordova is background audio so like

712
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:24,030
the audio actually plays on a background

713
00:28:24,030 --> 00:28:25,800
thread and it doesn't interrupt your

714
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:28,170
JavaScript so like there's times like

715
00:28:28,170 --> 00:28:29,820
when you're playing like like sound

716
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:32,280
loops where like Safari was pausing I

717
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:34,830
was having issues with this and like as

718
00:28:34,830 --> 00:28:37,440
soon as I put it in Cordova and the

719
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:40,440
really other nice thing about it is it's

720
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:42,270
runtime in a like you can just check it

721
00:28:42,270 --> 00:28:44,550
at runtime so like if I run this app on

722
00:28:44,550 --> 00:28:45,810
my on my laptop

723
00:28:45,810 --> 00:28:47,500
it doesn't use

724
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:49,690
Cordova and it just checks and it just

725
00:28:49,690 --> 00:28:51,640
uses the native browser audio function

726
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:53,650
so it's it's really easy to kind of

727
00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:55,360
integrate it into your apps like just

728
00:28:55,360 --> 00:29:00,250
piecemeal this is fun I saw I just got

729
00:29:00,250 --> 00:29:02,590
this about a week ago I don't know has

730
00:29:02,590 --> 00:29:04,030
anybody got in to play with electron yet

731
00:29:04,030 --> 00:29:08,410
it's quite new it's okay for people good

732
00:29:08,410 --> 00:29:10,990
awesome so electron is kind of like the

733
00:29:10,990 --> 00:29:13,630
new hotness it's kind of like the next

734
00:29:13,630 --> 00:29:15,960
PhoneGap it's by the github guys and

735
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:19,120
basically it allows you to build native

736
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:22,030
applications in JavaScript both on OS X

737
00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:24,400
and Windows it's not more it's not for

738
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:26,700
mobile as much it's more for desktops

739
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:28,630
but what's kind of cool is that it

740
00:29:28,630 --> 00:29:31,150
packages Chrome with your JavaScript

741
00:29:31,150 --> 00:29:34,870
application so like kind of annoying

742
00:29:34,870 --> 00:29:36,430
because like on iOS you always have to

743
00:29:36,430 --> 00:29:39,430
have Safari and I I personally like

744
00:29:39,430 --> 00:29:41,380
coding in Chrome better than Safari so

745
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:42,850
like my app always just works better in

746
00:29:42,850 --> 00:29:44,650
chrome so this this is kind of cool and

747
00:29:44,650 --> 00:29:46,630
the other nice thing is if you want to

748
00:29:46,630 --> 00:29:48,190
package it up for the Mac App Store or

749
00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:49,780
the Windows app store you can actually

750
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:52,360
create a binary to distribute with your

751
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:55,240
application and I thought oh man this is

752
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:56,860
gonna be a pain in the neck this is

753
00:29:56,860 --> 00:29:59,170
gonna be like all this hard stuff to set

754
00:29:59,170 --> 00:30:02,770
it up and it I turned out like you write

755
00:30:02,770 --> 00:30:05,800
one javascript file and you write like

756
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:07,810
40 lines of code in the JavaScript file

757
00:30:07,810 --> 00:30:09,720
and that's it and you're done and

758
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:11,950
basically all the code is is you're just

759
00:30:11,950 --> 00:30:13,810
defining how large you want the window

760
00:30:13,810 --> 00:30:16,570
to be and like defining if you want it

761
00:30:16,570 --> 00:30:18,460
to be fullscreen or not and it's just

762
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:21,040
this really really simple stuff and and

763
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:22,840
in like five minutes you guys can have

764
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:25,120
like a native OSX app and it looks like

765
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,890
an app and what's cool is you can have

766
00:30:26,890 --> 00:30:29,590
like the nice icons and stuff like that

767
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:31,360
so it looks like it's like the native

768
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:34,180
OSX apps in fact I spent more time just

769
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:35,770
trying to get code signing to work on

770
00:30:35,770 --> 00:30:39,730
OSX which is a real pain like to do that

771
00:30:39,730 --> 00:30:41,680
to get in the Mac App Store like that

772
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:46,570
was that was a bigger nightmare so I'm

773
00:30:46,570 --> 00:30:48,580
gonna give you a demo of this code but I

774
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:51,640
just wanted to wrap up and kind of bring

775
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:56,020
back a couple points I'm I don't use

776
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:57,610
JavaScript for my day-to-day work but

777
00:30:57,610 --> 00:30:59,500
making a game in JavaScript was really

778
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:01,120
easy

779
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:05,169
I think you know I would avoid the

780
00:31:05,169 --> 00:31:07,059
cross-platform tools honestly unless you

781
00:31:07,059 --> 00:31:09,370
really have a need like I had a need to

782
00:31:09,370 --> 00:31:11,890
use him I spent more time futzing with

783
00:31:11,890 --> 00:31:14,740
couldn't with PhoneGap then I would have

784
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:19,510
liked and its really easy to get going

785
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:21,370
in a game writing a game in JavaScript

786
00:31:21,370 --> 00:31:23,470
literally over a single weekend you can

787
00:31:23,470 --> 00:31:26,950
put together a game no problem

788
00:31:26,950 --> 00:31:29,860
so I I really encourage it I would love

789
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:31,450
to see some games for kids

790
00:31:31,450 --> 00:31:34,000
i I I want to make some games around

791
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,130
math like this is kind of what I want to

792
00:31:36,130 --> 00:31:41,019
do this is all open source it's on my

793
00:31:41,019 --> 00:31:43,889
github which I forgot to put a link to

794
00:31:43,889 --> 00:31:46,750
but if you if you hit me up afterwards

795
00:31:46,750 --> 00:31:49,149
also to you and if you want to pack it

796
00:31:49,149 --> 00:31:51,279
if you want to make a Chinese version or

797
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:53,320
a Korean version I kind of want to do a

798
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:55,389
Japanese one next because I'm learning

799
00:31:55,389 --> 00:31:58,090
Japanese but I would love to see some

800
00:31:58,090 --> 00:32:02,559
other people hack on it and I'm going to

801
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:04,450
do a little bit of demo because we have

802
00:32:04,450 --> 00:32:06,250
a few more minutes and then then I'll

803
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:07,870
open up for questions in a few minutes

804
00:32:07,870 --> 00:32:18,700
so cool it's just nice so basically what

805
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:19,870
I was talking about at the beginning of

806
00:32:19,870 --> 00:32:22,299
the presentation where I use gulp and

807
00:32:22,299 --> 00:32:26,399
Bowser jams so basically I just run gulp

808
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:29,380
and it sets up the entire environment

809
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:36,659
and it runs the app here actually I

810
00:32:36,659 --> 00:32:38,889
don't have a Thai keyboard on this

811
00:32:38,889 --> 00:32:40,510
laptop so I'm gonna actually just change

812
00:32:40,510 --> 00:32:46,389
this to English for now I it's funny

813
00:32:46,389 --> 00:32:47,980
when I was developing the game I didn't

814
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:49,570
I couldn't type Thai fast enough to

815
00:32:49,570 --> 00:32:51,220
actually develop the game so I had to

816
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:55,120
put an English mode in cuz because

817
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:56,710
otherwise I was like I could never get

818
00:32:56,710 --> 00:33:01,000
to the end of the level it was really

819
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:06,429
bad it's really funny yeah so so what's

820
00:33:06,429 --> 00:33:11,440
kind of cool is I want to just

821
00:33:11,450 --> 00:33:13,640
so what's cool is now since we're in

822
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:15,830
JavaScript obviously we have our normal

823
00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:17,570
JavaScript console and everything like

824
00:33:17,570 --> 00:33:20,390
this now there are some things missing

825
00:33:20,390 --> 00:33:23,120
right cuz this is just a giant canvas so

826
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:25,460
we can't like do introspections so like

827
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:27,530
if we inspect the element really we just

828
00:33:27,530 --> 00:33:29,780
have a giant canvas right we're just cuz

829
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:31,160
we're just doing 2d bleeding we're not

830
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:33,380
actually using HTML elements at all of

831
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:35,750
this I mean it's almost like making a

832
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:37,910
game on a console and in that kind of

833
00:33:37,910 --> 00:33:40,130
sense but what's cool is like now that

834
00:33:40,130 --> 00:33:42,049
we're in JavaScript we can actually do

835
00:33:42,049 --> 00:33:44,000
things like we can look at we can

836
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,799
inspect elements on the stage and stuff

837
00:33:45,799 --> 00:33:51,080
like this let me go so like for example

838
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:54,890
if we wanted to change the word in the

839
00:33:54,890 --> 00:33:56,990
middle of the the running we can do nice

840
00:33:56,990 --> 00:33:58,040
things like this so we can actually

841
00:33:58,040 --> 00:34:04,040
check it and and this is I love this

842
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:12,379
workflow so let me get at it full screen

843
00:34:12,389 --> 00:34:14,730
so yeah so my development workflow is

844
00:34:14,730 --> 00:34:16,589
like this where and if you have two

845
00:34:16,589 --> 00:34:18,809
monitors obviously I found this so much

846
00:34:18,809 --> 00:34:20,429
better because I used to like to hack on

847
00:34:20,429 --> 00:34:22,739
games in C++ when I was much younger and

848
00:34:22,739 --> 00:34:25,200
this was always a nightmare cuz you

849
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:26,940
would like you would want to tweak

850
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:29,759
things so like you don't have a GUI

851
00:34:29,759 --> 00:34:31,589
editor right so like if you wanted like

852
00:34:31,589 --> 00:34:33,419
if the monster is like offset by ten

853
00:34:33,419 --> 00:34:36,269
pixels you don't have any way of like

854
00:34:36,269 --> 00:34:38,129
easily doing that you have to change the

855
00:34:38,129 --> 00:34:39,629
code right it's like every time you

856
00:34:39,629 --> 00:34:43,109
wanted to change the code so you know if

857
00:34:43,109 --> 00:34:47,279
I wanted to make the monster like jump

858
00:34:47,279 --> 00:34:50,879
here and we that we could actually just

859
00:34:50,879 --> 00:35:01,990
change it and see if that

860
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,550
it's not good yeah so it just makes it

861
00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:07,970
really easy so this is I really like

862
00:35:07,970 --> 00:35:10,869
this workflow and I'm going to show you

863
00:35:10,869 --> 00:35:13,250
there's only a couple thousand lines of

864
00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:16,160
code in this whole project and it gets

865
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:20,300
broken out pretty easily so that's

866
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:23,000
that's pretty much it I'm gonna open it

867
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:27,349
up for a few questions now yes thanks

868
00:35:27,349 --> 00:35:27,950
Matthew

869
00:35:27,950 --> 00:35:37,010
so any questions for Matthew so what the

870
00:35:37,010 --> 00:35:40,340
artwork for the game oh um I have a

871
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:42,460
designer friend

872
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:45,380
yeah that's oh but what's cool is

873
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:47,630
there's actually a lot of open source

874
00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:50,359
game artwork especially if you're

875
00:35:50,359 --> 00:35:53,240
building 2d games I don't have the links

876
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:56,180
handy but if you just google to the open

877
00:35:56,180 --> 00:35:57,230
source there's actually a huge

878
00:35:57,230 --> 00:35:58,820
communities because a lot of people like

879
00:35:58,820 --> 00:36:02,599
to remake the old RPGs like the Final

880
00:36:02,599 --> 00:36:07,310
Fantasy type games yeah okay yeah

881
00:36:07,310 --> 00:36:08,839
question is there like a framework

882
00:36:08,839 --> 00:36:10,880
that's react based for game because this

883
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:13,130
seems like a really good you know demo

884
00:36:13,130 --> 00:36:16,400
or the use case yeah I don't know of one

885
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,109
that react but see the thing is is that

886
00:36:18,109 --> 00:36:19,369
I don't know if you would need to

887
00:36:19,369 --> 00:36:21,380
because a lot of the stuff in like react

888
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:24,140
or angular are built around HTML

889
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:26,599
elements and this is like you're

890
00:36:26,599 --> 00:36:28,730
building a canvas like it's it's kind of

891
00:36:28,730 --> 00:36:31,040
like you're just doing 2d bleeding so

892
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:33,290
like I don't know if it would help you

893
00:36:33,290 --> 00:36:36,050
as much as you would think there's not a

894
00:36:36,050 --> 00:36:43,760
whole lot to it actually solution or you

895
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:48,230
just write a hole for the text one for

896
00:36:48,230 --> 00:36:49,609
though say that one more time no

897
00:36:49,609 --> 00:36:52,130
collision oh for the localization oh

898
00:36:52,130 --> 00:36:52,910
well

899
00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:54,980
localization happened to be easy because

900
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:57,500
I live in Thailand so I have lots of

901
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:59,570
people that speak Thai around me so I

902
00:36:59,570 --> 00:37:04,940
got it for free it was pretty oh if you

903
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:06,560
want to you want to localize the game

904
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,810
yeah so the way the way you would just

905
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:10,790
do the localization is pretty easy just

906
00:37:10,790 --> 00:37:12,560
like any other JavaScript app I would

907
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:14,210
probably just have a map

908
00:37:14,210 --> 00:37:16,460
of strings and the way I've always done

909
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:18,020
it is just have a map of strings and I

910
00:37:18,020 --> 00:37:20,290
just swap out this strings

911
00:37:20,290 --> 00:37:24,170
nothing fancy or different in a game yes

912
00:37:24,170 --> 00:37:27,430
from the last road sorry the performance

913
00:37:27,430 --> 00:37:29,390
when it was released how was the

914
00:37:29,390 --> 00:37:31,460
performance on the devices Oh

915
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:33,890
so I mean performance wise like were you

916
00:37:33,890 --> 00:37:37,820
getting 60fps or was it yet so the when

917
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:40,310
I first wrote it I didn't even try it on

918
00:37:40,310 --> 00:37:41,630
the device and when I first ran in on

919
00:37:41,630 --> 00:37:43,490
device it was 60 frames a second until

920
00:37:43,490 --> 00:37:45,350
it's popped until it was 0 frames a

921
00:37:45,350 --> 00:37:48,620
second but once what happened is I ended

922
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:49,820
up figuring out there are certain

923
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:52,040
trigger points in Safari like when you

924
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:54,710
talk to the keyboard like it would just

925
00:37:54,710 --> 00:37:56,390
pause the whole thread and that was the

926
00:37:56,390 --> 00:37:57,950
main thing was just getting around these

927
00:37:57,950 --> 00:37:59,960
there's a couple bumps where it would

928
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:03,110
but like on an iPhone either five or six

929
00:38:03,110 --> 00:38:05,060
is the main ones I've tested it's 60

930
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:07,870
frames a second with almost no tuning so

931
00:38:07,870 --> 00:38:11,180
right so I guess what you men show

932
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:13,790
before you can use the console like the

933
00:38:13,790 --> 00:38:15,950
JavaScript console or the chrome console

934
00:38:15,950 --> 00:38:19,940
to modify things so in a way it makes

935
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:22,940
people possible to hack your games is

936
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:27,800
there a way to yeah okay so the question

937
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:29,900
is is it's cuz it's a JavaScript can

938
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:31,790
people hack the game yeah of course but

939
00:38:31,790 --> 00:38:34,040
that's kind of fun I kind of like that's

940
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:36,650
why I liked how the script is cuz like

941
00:38:36,650 --> 00:38:39,080
if somebody wanted to tweak it like you

942
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:40,280
know sometimes I was finding something

943
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:42,590
annoying you could like skip a level in

944
00:38:42,590 --> 00:38:44,120
the game right it's kind of like when

945
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:45,500
you're a kid and they had like the cheat

946
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:47,990
codes for the game but in this the cheat

947
00:38:47,990 --> 00:38:49,190
codes are you actually learn something

948
00:38:49,190 --> 00:38:52,760
so I mean I think it would be very

949
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:55,400
difficult to stop right the only thing

950
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:56,810
you could really do is try to make it

951
00:38:56,810 --> 00:38:58,340
something on the server side if you had

952
00:38:58,340 --> 00:39:00,260
a server-side game but yeah I don't

953
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:06,590
think you can stop it completely make

954
00:39:06,590 --> 00:39:09,380
sure that is fun while staying simple

955
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:11,480
right oh that's that's a great question

956
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:12,860
how do you make sure that the game is

957
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:15,140
fun well simple and that's why I think

958
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:16,130
you got to throw away a lot of

959
00:39:16,130 --> 00:39:18,710
prototypes so when we originally made

960
00:39:18,710 --> 00:39:20,330
this I'd made that we were making this

961
00:39:20,330 --> 00:39:21,560
with a graphic designer friend of mine

962
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:23,900
and what we did was we ended up taking

963
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:26,540
like ten different

964
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:28,010
versions actually I would like to show

965
00:39:28,010 --> 00:39:30,680
we had tender we had ten different like

966
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:33,050
iterations we did in just like Photoshop

967
00:39:33,050 --> 00:39:35,600
and we just played around we were like

968
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:37,520
okay would this work would this work and

969
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:39,980
we didn't even write any code and even

970
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:41,090
if you don't do Photoshop I would just

971
00:39:41,090 --> 00:39:43,010
do it on paper and like just go through

972
00:39:43,010 --> 00:39:45,200
different concepts because like we came

973
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,060
through I mean this isn't even that

974
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:48,470
complex of a game but we went through

975
00:39:48,470 --> 00:39:50,570
early ten different ones that just won't

976
00:39:50,570 --> 00:39:56,720
make any sense at all all right Thank

977
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:58,750
You Matthew

978
00:39:58,750 --> 00:40:03,010
[Applause]

979
00:40:03,010 --> 00:40:25,980
