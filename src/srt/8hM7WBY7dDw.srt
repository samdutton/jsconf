00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,050
today I spoke about a project that I've

10
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:00,670
been working on for about a year called

11
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:02,380
style components get ready for the

12
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:05,110
future of CSS statement CSS is real

13
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:07,390
development and we do value it CSS MJS

14
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:10,150
you should definitely do a personal

15
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:13,420
project that is quite ambitious together

16
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:15,760
and then you can get amazing results art

17
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:19,479
history and its relationship with CSS

18
00:01:19,479 --> 00:01:22,030
optimizing the delivery of our CSS and

19
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:23,800
other critical resources on the webpage

20
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:26,619
how CSS gets made really I'm basically

21
00:01:26,619 --> 00:01:29,350
lab coding a CSS game for everybody here

22
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:30,800
today

23
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:30,930
[Applause]

00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:48,060
[Music]

25
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:53,620


26
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:56,280
what I love about the conference is the

27
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:59,910
how the talks are scheduled in near

28
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:02,850
twine and the balance of technical and

29
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:05,340
non-technical remarkable group of people

30
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:07,800
such a collection of skills and

31
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,720
backgrounds I just feel like the

32
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,400
entirety of the conference is so well

33
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,440
done and thoughtfully done that's that's

34
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,120
what makes me excited to come to it

35
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,430
because I know that about it people are

36
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:19,500
all in one place at the same time and

37
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,720
then during our actually outside and

38
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,340
talks people can communicate and talk

39
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:25,560
about things they've just heard well I

40
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,970
mean that the first thing is definitely

41
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:28,500
offering chakra in the first place you

42
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:29,610
are one of the first conferences that

43
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:31,560
I've ever heard that's done that it's

44
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,660
actually made a much warmer safer

45
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:36,180
environment for everyone in the future

46
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:37,739
maybe you put together a personal

47
00:02:37,739 --> 00:02:39,750
project maybe you come to the conference

48
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:42,300
and you see someone speak and you say

49
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,100
hey I can do that and you submit a

50
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:46,110
proposal and then you're on stage next

51
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:48,330
year I just met somebody who implemented

52
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:51,510
CSS grid in browsers I never really get

53
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:52,769
to talk to the actual implementers of

54
00:02:52,769 --> 00:02:55,200
these things that I use in love I feel

55
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,400
like every couple of years there is

56
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,540
something new and there's something new

57
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:59,700
to learn and this conference has the

58
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:05,300
best people to teach you the best things

59
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:05,720
[Applause]

00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:13,500
[Music]

61
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:16,550
we have of course a bigger venue and

62
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:18,320
more opportunities for people to

63
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,720
interact the best part is that despite

64
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,730
the bigger venue or thanks to the bigger

65
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:24,620
venue the community spirit remains the

66
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:26,480
same I think we need these events to

67
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,880
bring diverse and different positions

68
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,650
together we need all those people from

69
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:32,150
different countries in one room to

70
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:33,770
actually make progress and come to new

71
00:03:33,770 --> 00:03:35,270
insights and I think it's already

72
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:36,650
happening here today and that's great

73
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:38,840
and like over the years it feels like a

74
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:47,650
big family reunion every year

75
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:55,140
