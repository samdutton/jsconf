1
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:19,300

I'm going to be talking about useless

2
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:22,300
where useless where is I don't know if

3
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:24,210
it's a real term or not but it should be

4
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:27,700
and I'd like you guys to invest some

5
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:29,290
time and use the swear in the future

6
00:00:29,290 --> 00:00:33,040
it's completely up to you so an

7
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,390
introduction to use the square what is

8
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:38,530
it useless where is probably exactly

9
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:40,720
what you want it to be but it's it's

10
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:42,880
taking yourself a little less seriously

11
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:46,660
it's having fun with code and it's it's

12
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:48,760
really just making something entirely

13
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:50,860
useless because you'd like to program

14
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:53,200
and you like to try new things out so uh

15
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:56,500
I like to set some ground rules and say

16
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:58,150
that it solves a problem that no one

17
00:00:58,150 --> 00:01:01,930
wants solved it's usually funny it's

18
00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:03,550
better when it's funny it doesn't have

19
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:05,380
to be a try to pick something that

20
00:01:05,380 --> 00:01:08,680
you've never done before and and have a

21
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:11,050
lot of fun and and then pimp it on

22
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:13,090
Twitter afterwards and people retweet

23
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:16,630
the hell out of joke libraries and they

24
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:17,770
don't care about the stuff you actually

25
00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:19,990
work on all day but it's important

26
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:21,250
because you can learn a lot and other

27
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:23,140
people can learn a lot it's a good way

28
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:24,899
to get into the space it's a good way to

29
00:01:24,899 --> 00:01:30,220
learn how to even manage issues on

30
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:32,979
github even though they're joke messages

31
00:01:32,979 --> 00:01:34,330
and all that kind of stuff so I'm

32
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:36,789
totally serious in that one of the best

33
00:01:36,789 --> 00:01:39,069
things ever did was release a useless

34
00:01:39,069 --> 00:01:41,380
where library and it kind of just bumped

35
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:43,509
me up into this group of people who was

36
00:01:43,509 --> 00:01:45,789
committing code and taking contributors

37
00:01:45,789 --> 00:01:48,420
even though it was all entirely false

38
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:51,759
but but above all useless where is all

39
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:55,119
about taking yourself not quite as

40
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:57,090
seriously we're writing code we're not

41
00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:00,099
we're not necessarily a solving world

42
00:02:00,099 --> 00:02:01,690
hunger I mean you can solve world hunger

43
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:05,289
via kosher but uh but we don't need to

44
00:02:05,289 --> 00:02:07,420
get so heated all the time and we can

45
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:09,789
have some fun with our code so I'm going

46
00:02:09,789 --> 00:02:12,190
to go through a brief history of some

47
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:15,640
useless where that I've seen the first

48
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,560
one being hello world pretty useless

49
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:21,010
program it's kind of a historical

50
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:24,370
example at first showed up in 1974 does

51
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:25,840
absolutely nothing you want it to do

52
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,989
it's not very funny but uh it's it's

53
00:02:28,989 --> 00:02:30,549
educational it really helps you kind of

54
00:02:30,549 --> 00:02:31,050
like it

55
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:34,010
that first step into grasping a language

56
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:36,990
or a or a framework or anything like

57
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:39,180
that and so that's kind of the whole

58
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:42,330
reason why useless where is is a good

59
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:44,610
idea because it gives you the same hello

60
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:46,890
world type advantage to whatever you're

61
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:51,870
trying to learn next one it's not

62
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:53,640
actually historical but it's hilarious

63
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:56,520
so I put the Shakespeare language I

64
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,990
don't know if you guys have ever seen

65
00:02:57,990 --> 00:03:00,110
the Shakespeare language but it's a

66
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:03,840
Shakespeare style text that actually

67
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,420
parses out as a program so i'll switch

68
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:09,270
over to the hello world example and

69
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:12,420
shakespeare lang real fast let me full

70
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:18,180
screen on this not launch i-tunes either

71
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:22,860
or full screen itunes all right uh I

72
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:25,890
guess I'm out of order here's hello

73
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:31,110
world in Shakespeare lang Romeo a young

74
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:33,930
man with a remarkable patience so all of

75
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:36,360
this actually parses out and you run

76
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:40,620
that in the command line and it actually

77
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:44,570
prints out hello world so that's your

78
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:47,400
entirely useless but can you imagine if

79
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,540
you were the person like wouldn't it be

80
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:50,940
hilarious if we could get Shakespeare's

81
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:54,450
style text two parts into a language and

82
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:56,790
then you learn how to parse text you

83
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:58,650
learn how to do free contacts grammars

84
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:01,410
you learn how to write all all that kind

85
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:04,230
of stuff to make this work and be so I

86
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:05,910
mean you've got to have a lot of

87
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:08,489
tolerance in something like this so the

88
00:04:08,489 --> 00:04:09,600
amount that these people probably

89
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:14,550
learned is immeasurable so I'll move up

90
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:18,600
that's not how that works three all

91
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:21,239
right other examples of that are Lowell

92
00:04:21,239 --> 00:04:23,850
code if anyone's ever seen locos just hi

93
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:27,630
i can has a variable and then you set

94
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:29,490
the variable that way and there's like

95
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:34,140
python and so it's you add the like in

96
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:36,750
between like give me a variable it's

97
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:39,510
pretty good this actually i think got

98
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:40,620
bumped up but i might as well talk about

99
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:44,289
it since it's here I the

100
00:04:44,289 --> 00:04:46,659
best part about useless where is the

101
00:04:46,659 --> 00:04:48,669
joke websites you get to make along with

102
00:04:48,669 --> 00:04:50,649
them the these are only kind of have

103
00:04:50,649 --> 00:04:52,270
some useless wear on them and i'll show

104
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:54,069
some more in a little bit but i made a

105
00:04:54,069 --> 00:04:57,129
part of html5 calm this is what is part

106
00:04:57,129 --> 00:04:58,659
of html5 become it's just like a

107
00:04:58,659 --> 00:05:00,999
sub-domain software and this is like

108
00:05:00,999 --> 00:05:02,229
when everyone was like is such-and-such

109
00:05:02,229 --> 00:05:05,860
part of html5 geolocation until like

110
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:09,279
here's your mom part of html5 right like

111
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:10,419
I encourage you want to do this because

112
00:05:10,419 --> 00:05:16,529
it makes my day and I guess keep doing

113
00:05:16,529 --> 00:05:20,020
so yeah check that out html5 rocks is a

114
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:24,309
good site to learn html5 from and then

115
00:05:24,309 --> 00:05:28,110
of course like if anyone seen slides dot

116
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:30,849
html5 rocks so like html5 rocks is the

117
00:05:30,849 --> 00:05:32,770
google google page so there's slides

118
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:34,599
html5 rocks it's like sweet thing

119
00:05:34,599 --> 00:05:36,009
everybody's using these days and it

120
00:05:36,009 --> 00:05:39,610
teaches you it the better slides html5

121
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:42,610
rocks with a zero slides additional

122
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:43,880
rocks

123
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:48,950
I don't have a large imagination also

124
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:53,210
there's html5 socks there's html5 other

125
00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:58,310
words that rhyme with rocks too so some

126
00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:00,260
examples of useless where lovers is

127
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:01,610
someone will get that in like 10 minutes

128
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:05,120
so so Adam Sontag's probably in the

129
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,430
audience somewhere he wait in the back

130
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:09,860
he he recently put out a beautiful

131
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:11,840
useless where library that I had already

132
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,000
said do this talk and I was I was very

133
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,890
happy put it out so a boilerplate

134
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:19,220
boilerplate is a boilerplate library for

135
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:24,020
making boiler plates so we can we can

136
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:25,940
look at the the source real fast of

137
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:27,950
boilerplate boilerplate if I can get

138
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:30,320
there here we go so he has a read meat

139
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:32,060
which is really the entire project

140
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:34,730
obviously you so square doesn't have to

141
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:36,290
be big i don't know if that was a thing

142
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:39,230
it just has to prove your point and

143
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:40,460
that's one of the best things about it

144
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:42,920
is that it you can actually prove some

145
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:45,290
really great points so how to use it you

146
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:47,030
forth the repository you edit the read

147
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:48,800
but you wouldn't want this in there you

148
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,840
substitute in your projects name do all

149
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:54,170
the work give Adam credit and preferably

150
00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:56,630
use the word excellent get rid of

151
00:06:56,630 --> 00:06:59,030
everything before here and then sub in

152
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:00,530
your projects name it's beautiful it's

153
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:04,420
it's a perfect example of useless where

154
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:06,860
and it actually gently kind of points

155
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:09,740
out the fact that maybe boiler plates

156
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:12,260
people shouldn't take them so seriously

157
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:14,060
hey this is a this is a good starting

158
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:16,790
point maybe and you shouldn't worry

159
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:18,530
about the things that you you hate and

160
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:21,430
then yell at Paul Irish for putting in a

161
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:23,810
script loader into the html5 boilerplate

162
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:27,110
like he doesn't care text-align Centaurs

163
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:30,650
I think one of my favorites in recent

164
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:33,770
time I I considered not putting this as

165
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:35,300
useless where because I totally already

166
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:38,450
use it on all my websites but it's

167
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:41,450
exactly what it sounds like quite to the

168
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:45,320
T text-align centaur you have a block of

169
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:47,030
text and then you can press the button

170
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:50,800
down here and it becomes the Centaur

171
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:56,050
very beautiful there's rubygems and

172
00:07:56,050 --> 00:07:57,789
I think someone's working on an NPM

173
00:07:57,789 --> 00:08:01,090
package for this as well so no worries

174
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:03,639
and the best part is you can go into the

175
00:08:03,639 --> 00:08:08,080
code for this and let's see the scent

176
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,789
rjs file so that hears you like your

177
00:08:09,789 --> 00:08:11,139
pattern matching hey that's kind of cool

178
00:08:11,139 --> 00:08:13,090
if you ever need to do like JavaScript

179
00:08:13,090 --> 00:08:16,240
like text pattern matching that's

180
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,560
actually kind of a nifty way to do it

181
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,479
and then it has this stuff and the best

182
00:08:19,479 --> 00:08:21,970
part is he actually does a feature test

183
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:29,680
for text align centaur just in case it

184
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,769
ever shows up in the real spec which I

185
00:08:32,769 --> 00:08:36,940
talked to Brandon and now that he has

186
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:39,610
anything do that spec go to jas is a

187
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:41,890
library this is how it cuz my foray into

188
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:44,800
useless where and it's exactly what it

189
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,720
sounds like it's go to in JavaScript

190
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:51,850
it's a joke but a lot of people didn't

191
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:53,230
get that was a joke because I kind of

192
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:54,820
used a lot of tongue-in-cheek it was

193
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:56,680
right when PHP was adding go to the

194
00:08:56,680 --> 00:09:00,399
JavaScript so here's a simple example is

195
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:04,270
you just go back and forth from this

196
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:07,899
label to this loop and 292 times and

197
00:09:07,899 --> 00:09:10,870
then it creates the URL this link which

198
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:13,060
stupid and then here's like this crazy

199
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:14,950
example of people like jumping all over

200
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:17,529
the place I think my favorite line in

201
00:09:17,529 --> 00:09:22,870
here is a also a it's somewhere in here

202
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:24,940
it says oh yeah because there are no

203
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:26,980
variables pass into the function you

204
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:28,420
can't jump in and out of a function

205
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:30,040
because if you're real go to power user

206
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:33,060
you probably don't use functions anyways

207
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:36,670
which probably still hold by that

208
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:39,070
someone on Hacker News told me once I

209
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:40,449
wrote that when i put it up on hacker

210
00:09:40,449 --> 00:09:42,610
news that they wish i would get hit by a

211
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:45,920
bus

212
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:49,660
uh so yeah malice follows you for your

213
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:52,210
useless where uh here's evil Jas and

214
00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:54,610
evil CSS a library that I've had the

215
00:09:54,610 --> 00:09:57,550
pleasure of committing to here's some

216
00:09:57,550 --> 00:09:59,710
examples they change the native

217
00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:02,020
JavaScript very extensible language so

218
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:04,510
let's change ceiling to always return 42

219
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:08,110
max returns min min returns infinity

220
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:14,920
power returns pow pow pow random I don't

221
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,780
even know from it returns a random

222
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:21,220
character based on a random member round

223
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:25,390
is obviously the square root pi is 3.2

224
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:29,970
that that one would get me I think I

225
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:31,930
actually added there's one in there too

226
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:37,000
that's if you if you have caps lock mode

227
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,070
or I guess to uppercase that's the the

228
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:41,530
function to uppercase I actually made it

229
00:10:41,530 --> 00:10:43,920
emulate as if you held shift down

230
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,300
instead of actually doing uppercase some

231
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:49,960
numbers become symbols and like Colin's

232
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,580
are wrong and all that stuff's it's just

233
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:56,500
barely wrong I thought was good Thunder

234
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:57,910
hub was one that was like last week

235
00:10:57,910 --> 00:11:00,760
Rezac put up Thunder hub and it's a

236
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:03,250
github repo that he has a another app

237
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:05,170
that will add anyone that you want as a

238
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:06,670
committer I don't know if you guys have

239
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:08,740
committed yet but like obviously the

240
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:11,620
first commit was like add more ascii

241
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:14,380
penises and then someone did it like

242
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:16,810
Isaac's like add it in like an NPM

243
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:18,640
module forward and everything right so

244
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:21,250
it's obviously that the like the gutter

245
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:26,050
of of everything that is like a terrible

246
00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:29,260
and awesome about community engagements

247
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:31,060
but but it's awesome it's it's totally

248
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:33,280
useless it's just a fun thing that uh

249
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:37,090
that everyone did vapor j/s is a library

250
00:11:37,090 --> 00:11:39,760
that Thomas Fuchs and I put out at JS

251
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:44,410
con tu and it's a zero byte micro

252
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:47,110
framework has a hundred percent test

253
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:49,300
coverage it's really really awesome I

254
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:51,640
encourage you to use it uses a lot of

255
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:54,400
the native stuff in JavaScript zero

256
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,800
lines of code it's one of the most

257
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,089
followed libraries on github

258
00:11:58,089 --> 00:12:00,699
we've been working tirelessly on version

259
00:12:00,699 --> 00:12:04,809
2 and one of the best things about it is

260
00:12:04,809 --> 00:12:07,269
now any time someone tells me oh well

261
00:12:07,269 --> 00:12:11,230
did you see dojos new selector is 310

262
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:14,379
micro nano seconds faster than J queries

263
00:12:14,379 --> 00:12:17,079
and then I tell them that vapors

264
00:12:17,079 --> 00:12:19,449
selector engine has never had an error

265
00:12:19,449 --> 00:12:24,519
oh so so my challenge to you is to write

266
00:12:24,519 --> 00:12:28,660
your own and do something fun it like

267
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:31,629
obviously like vapor Jas took us five

268
00:12:31,629 --> 00:12:33,790
minutes to think of drunk and one minute

269
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:36,610
to push to github and a long time to

270
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:40,600
read the tweets so do something similar

271
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,490
have fun with it learn something new

272
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:45,220
like use some node library you never

273
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:47,559
have and put up a funny website for it

274
00:12:47,559 --> 00:12:50,019
so we can all see it and then I have a

275
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:51,759
special announcement that actually we're

276
00:12:51,759 --> 00:12:54,339
pushing a security update to vapor Jas

277
00:12:54,339 --> 00:12:57,069
as of today it's a critical update that

278
00:12:57,069 --> 00:12:58,720
you need to get we also have one hundred

279
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,579
percent code reduction size hundred

280
00:13:00,579 --> 00:13:02,529
percent backwards compatibility hydrant

281
00:13:02,529 --> 00:13:05,259
test coverage so grab that today if

282
00:13:05,259 --> 00:13:08,620
you're using it in your sights and also

283
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:10,480
we have a new way to include vapor j/s

284
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,639
rather than put in the empty script tags

285
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:14,559
if you in line it you can actually with

286
00:13:14,559 --> 00:13:16,990
html5 you can not even include the

287
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:18,249
script tag all together it's just

288
00:13:18,249 --> 00:13:23,679
implied inclusion and that's also show

289
00:13:23,679 --> 00:13:25,329
me tweet me your libraries or whatever

290
00:13:25,329 --> 00:13:26,939
and maybe I'll put together some

291
00:13:26,939 --> 00:13:31,779
canonical resource for useless wear and
