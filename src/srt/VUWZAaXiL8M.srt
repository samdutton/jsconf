00:00:00,179 --> 00:00:01,179
From Advocacy to Innovation: How JS Developers
will shape the future of Internet Security,

2
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:31,650
[Applause]
AMELIA: Thank you.

3
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:32,650
Thank you, hello?

4
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:33,650
Is this - is this on?

5
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:34,650
All right.

6
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:37,320
Well, thank you so much for coming out, especially
after we drank all the beer last night.

7
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:44,329
Today I will be talking about how JavaScript
does/can change the way that we build tools

8
00:00:44,329 --> 00:00:46,420
and how they already are.

9
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:49,469
And this is probably not news to any of you
all.

10
00:00:49,469 --> 00:00:57,890
So my name is Amelia Abreu, and like Charlie
graciously introduced me I am a design researcher,

11
00:00:57,890 --> 00:01:01,970
and I've always been obsessed with categories.

12
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:09,840
I'm a Cuban American from Texas, who has lived
in the northwest for most of my adult life,

13
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:15,420
so it's hard sometimes to answer the question,
"Where are you from?"

14
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:22,510
And I would like to start out with a point
that categories and distinctions matter and

15
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:32,780
this is probably not news to JS devs, after
all language without classes, like requires

16
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:34,700
imposed classifications.

17
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:43,210
Yes, so today I'm going to talk about distinction
and classification, why these little things

18
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:48,990
matter, share some of my notes and observations
from working on development and security tools

19
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:54,910
over the past few years and make an argument
that there's a lot at stake here and that

20
00:01:54,910 --> 00:02:00,960
we can do better and we need to do better,
from a useability standpoint I always say

21
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:14,469
that usability like security is best bigged
in early on and as full stack JS reaches more

22
00:02:14,469 --> 00:02:18,629
and more momentum, it's more important to
think about this.

23
00:02:18,629 --> 00:02:21,109
So who am I and why am I talking about this?

24
00:02:21,109 --> 00:02:25,459
I'm a design researcher and I will speak a
little bit about how I hate the word "user".

25
00:02:25,459 --> 00:02:33,859
I would never describe anyone I respected
as a user, but the term user experience seems

26
00:02:33,859 --> 00:02:42,319
to have stuck to this area, and over the past
few years I've been working more on security

27
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:48,790
and engineering tools, and as a result I've
interviewed a lot of developers and worked

28
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:56,799
with a lot more, and I often find that my
relationship to the Deaf community is a little

29
00:02:56,799 --> 00:03:11,099
bit anthropological and prior to this I worked
in Seattle and before that I was a librarian

30
00:03:11,099 --> 00:03:17,449
and my first career was as a music writer,
and when I look back on these various threads,

31
00:03:17,449 --> 00:03:25,389
the thing that these all have in common is
that they all involve listening to people

32
00:03:25,389 --> 00:03:29,979
talk about complex and technical subjects.

33
00:03:29,979 --> 00:03:37,380
And this ongoing interaction with classification
and systems.

34
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:44,819
I also want to note that something that has
shaped me is that I am a child of the 1980s

35
00:03:44,819 --> 00:03:46,349
Texas hardware boom.

36
00:03:46,349 --> 00:03:51,099
My grandfather worked for Texas Instruments,
my mother was a mainframe operator and neither

37
00:03:51,099 --> 00:04:00,510
of these were glamorous jobs but they definitely
shaped my understanding of how - the pecking

38
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:07,159
order of hardware and software and obviously
we are living in a much different round these

39
00:04:07,159 --> 00:04:09,319
days.

40
00:04:09,319 --> 00:04:22,800
So first I am going to talk about distinction,
and taste classifies, and it classifies the

41
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,720
classifier.

42
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:35,510
So there was a study on thousands of folks
and it was found that their interests reflected

43
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:44,310
not only economic status but also cultural
status so if you like Petula Clarke that puts

44
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:51,540
you at a very middle brow status but if you
like shopping at the flea market that puts

45
00:04:51,540 --> 00:05:01,520
you in this square of artistic producers and
cultural capital, and this is something that

46
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:11,370
I think we can think about in less of a stratified
way but in a way of thinking: okay, the way

47
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:17,139
that we work, the way that we are, aesthetics
matter and they say a lot about us Bordieu

48
00:05:17,139 --> 00:05:24,810
also will matched this to the foods that we
like to eat and then a gastronomic magazine

49
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:36,469
classified this so where your pickles come
from says a lot about you.

50
00:05:36,469 --> 00:05:43,159
So in the past few years I have been working
a lot on developer tools and the term developer

51
00:05:43,159 --> 00:05:52,790
experience has come about, and I like it okay
because the word user, or as Laurel says "that

52
00:05:52,790 --> 00:06:00,270
demeaning little word user", is not something
you would use to describe someone you respected.

53
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:09,530
I would call a friend's bad boyfriend, "Oh,
he is a user", so how do we bring more of

54
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:15,060
that sense that we are working with folks
to build tools that they can use, tools that

55
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:21,129
they will integrate into their everyday lives
and everyday work, and that as developers

56
00:06:21,129 --> 00:06:33,629
we will be using whatever is at our disposal
to build better things for the end user, or

57
00:06:33,629 --> 00:06:35,199
for someone else down the line?

58
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:38,030
There's not really a good nomenclature for
that.

59
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:45,129
If anyone has any suggestions, feel free to
bring them to me after the presentation.

60
00:06:45,129 --> 00:06:49,220
Yes, so how does one do this?

61
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:54,500
I find that this is something that is often
mysterious.

62
00:06:54,500 --> 00:07:01,310
I work a lot with ethnographic interviews
which means I will bring the team that I'm

63
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:06,099
working with into the field to go hang out
with the people who will use the products

64
00:07:06,099 --> 00:07:11,509
that they are building, and I always say that
I'm going to write a book about doing user

65
00:07:11,509 --> 00:07:16,430
research that is asking dumb questions over
and over.

66
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:24,789
I will often ask people what seem like very
obvious questions and then just listen, and

67
00:07:24,789 --> 00:07:38,379
that takes a lot of humility and also patience
but when we do come to users with little expectation

68
00:07:38,379 --> 00:07:44,680
and little assumption, that's where we can
learn the most about work patterns, about

69
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:47,620
needs, about work-arounds.

70
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:55,689
Yesterday's presentation - it blows my mind,
it's blanking me because I'm jet lagged but

71
00:07:55,689 --> 00:08:03,129
there was a really great explanation about
work-arounds in a presentation yesterday that

72
00:08:03,129 --> 00:08:07,199
I loved.

73
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:16,229
And for devs it's often hard to distinguish
between what about the users of your product

74
00:08:16,229 --> 00:08:21,650
are going to be different than you and your
team and I always like to start with this

75
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:24,770
question: well, what text editor do you use?

76
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:33,740
Because if you are using Emacs you will have
different keyboard shortcutting and different

77
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:38,680
usage patterns than say someone using VIM.

78
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:48,690
And this is often an issue when it comes to
developer tools because they often come out

79
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:50,870
of a roll your own solution.

80
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:57,199
I automate something in my job; I share it
with my boss; I share it with my team.

81
00:08:57,199 --> 00:09:05,180
We say, "Oh, let's bring this to the greater
public".

82
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:12,620
This onion you see here, this comes from a
framework called cognitive work analysis which

83
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:22,190
was developed in the 50s to understand how
pilots and nuclear power plant operators related

84
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:29,180
to their dashboards and negotiated their work
and I like to call this the Homer Simpson

85
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:35,570
doughnut because at the end of the day we
are all Homer Simpson trying to make sense

86
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:41,810
of something that's often complex, and not
really designed for us, and you can see here

87
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:50,200
this was using the Python DES to better understand
how they used the tools.

88
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:59,970
So I often work with - I work with fairly
conventional hardware companies and software

89
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:07,480
companies and the idea of full stack JS makes
them very nervous.

90
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:15,769
It's like, "Oh, the inmates are running the
asylum", and as folks of the Node Foundation

91
00:10:15,769 --> 00:10:27,090
like to say all 500 Fortune companies are
running Node however this does disrupt long

92
00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:36,589
held beliefs about web devs in this hardware-centric
hierarchy of things.

93
00:10:36,589 --> 00:10:44,259
Oftentimes when I go into the field and interview
JS devs the way that they work is different

94
00:10:44,259 --> 00:10:48,350
than say some folks working "closer to the
metal".

95
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:56,639
I will tell you a little bit about the differences
that I've found and this is based on qualitative

96
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:57,639
research.

97
00:10:57,639 --> 00:11:05,959
I do not have large scale demographics to
support this but this is something that I

98
00:11:05,959 --> 00:11:12,519
would urge you all to think about, is thinking
about where can we get, you know, collecting

99
00:11:12,519 --> 00:11:21,980
more demographics about the backgrounds of
your fellow JS devs and quantifying how this

100
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:32,390
is a more diverse and less conventional community
than we might have previously ascribed to

101
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:36,200
software or server side development.

102
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:43,149
That's a first insight and it's probably not
news to anyone here, is that, because there

103
00:11:43,149 --> 00:11:50,630
is no one standard way to become a JavaScript
developer, oftentimes JS devs will acknowledge

104
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:57,430
this plurality and often I will interview
folks who work in teams together and they

105
00:11:57,430 --> 00:12:05,110
will say, "Yes, like I do things totally different
to him", and this is something that I find

106
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:12,269
that JS devs are far more comfortable with
than some of their counterparts.

107
00:12:12,269 --> 00:12:13,440
This is a strength.

108
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:19,620
I would argue that this is something that
we want to acknowledge and see as a strength.

109
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:24,279
I think it makes for better products, a more
diverse user base.

110
00:12:24,279 --> 00:12:31,660
I've also found, and this is something that
seems a little bit wishy-washy but I want

111
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:39,959
you to bear with me, I found that, since many
JS devs came of age during desktop-centric

112
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:45,190
frameworks but have since moved into mobile
and Internet of Things projects, they have

113
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:53,639
a better conception of code living in the
wild and living in the physical realm, and

114
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:57,940
I also find that a lot of the JS devs that
I interview have interests in the physical

115
00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:05,079
realm, whether they are knitters or skateboarders
or mountain bikers, and this is something

116
00:13:05,079 --> 00:13:13,850
that is seen not as anathematic to making
software but something that complements it

117
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:23,860
and this is once again pushing back on the
more immaterial sensibilities of the tradition,

118
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:28,870
you know, neck beard security developers that
I work with.

119
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:32,199
That term is used with respect.

120
00:13:32,199 --> 00:13:44,930
The last and maybe most quantifiable and most
important finding that I've made over the

121
00:13:44,930 --> 00:13:53,980
past few years is that JS devs oftentimes
coming from front end work have a better idea

122
00:13:53,980 --> 00:14:02,270
of advocating for the end user and they often
speak with a desire to help others.

123
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:08,680
I was working on a Internet of Things security
tool this last year and one of the devs said

124
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:14,400
to me I don't want to make an insecure baby
surveillance device.

125
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:25,529
And this was very self-aware, I thought, and
also very aware of the impact that one's work

126
00:14:25,529 --> 00:14:32,310
had in the world, but we are at a crossroads
here.

127
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:40,019
Having a desire to help others is not the
same as actually helping others, and I find

128
00:14:40,019 --> 00:14:47,519
that notions of advocacy are all well and
good but they are often - there's often a

129
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:50,720
conflict about how to actually put those into
action.

130
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:58,420
I often say that doing what I do, I often
come to the table when things are already

131
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:02,850
on fire.

132
00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:10,879
And my goal in the work that I do is helping
you all to smell the smoke, because here's

133
00:15:10,879 --> 00:15:16,860
the thing: I am very sick of empathy as a
corporate buzz word.

134
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:22,800
Empathy for me is Bill Clinton saying, "I
feel your pain", it's a gratifying thing to

135
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:34,759
dispense of and it's often, you know, rewarding
to hear it, if someone empathises with you,

136
00:15:34,759 --> 00:15:39,230
but empathy without action is pretty meaningless.

137
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:45,060
So how do we build advocacy?

138
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:51,529
If you haven't run across this scene from
the group Indigenous Action I would really

139
00:15:51,529 --> 00:16:00,910
encourage it and I find that we need to think
about our user or end users and the folks

140
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:06,149
that we work with as accomplices, not allies.

141
00:16:06,149 --> 00:16:14,389
We want to be with them while they use the
products that we build, and that we need - and

142
00:16:14,389 --> 00:16:19,069
that in order to do that we need to build
trust and consent.

143
00:16:19,069 --> 00:16:21,240
No one is going to let us in.

144
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:26,870
No one is going to trust us until we build
that trust, and we build that trust by walking

145
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:35,400
alongside them, by acknowledging those diverse
viewpoints and building meaning into our data

146
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:39,399
gathering.

147
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:44,320
Oftentimes when I work on developer products,
there's not a really good explanation of who

148
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:47,730
it's actually for.

149
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:53,269
This is something that I find that JS devs
have a very low bullshit meter for.

150
00:16:53,269 --> 00:16:56,269
You know, what's the story behind this?

151
00:16:56,269 --> 00:16:59,130
Why am I supposed to use it?

152
00:16:59,130 --> 00:17:02,910
This doesn't make sense with what I'm doing.

153
00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:13,250
I worked on an API this past year that was
developed by folks working in CEE and the

154
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:20,400
way that the calls were formed just didn't
match JS syntax at all, not that there is

155
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:26,190
any rhyme or reason to JS syntax but that's
not my field of expertise.

156
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:33,660
Yes, and this is something I find with developer
tools is that we need to give a reason for

157
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:35,400
folks to use it.

158
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:45,700
We need to exculpate the stories and make
a case for it because unless - and there are

159
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:53,890
some notable exceptions to this, but unless
we make a case for a usable security solution

160
00:17:53,890 --> 00:18:02,160
or for an easily implementable security solution,
it's not going to happen.

161
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:09,280
I think that in this community our diversity
is our strength but we need ways to understand

162
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:20,131
our impact and I will repeat my plea to build
more data on demographic diversity; build

163
00:18:20,131 --> 00:18:31,090
more data on who is deploys JS frameworks
at every level of the stack and how it's different,

164
00:18:31,090 --> 00:18:41,340
how workflows are different, and how this
makes for a better impact.

165
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:51,670
And I think that this is especially important
when our work impacts very vulnerable people.

166
00:18:51,670 --> 00:18:58,820
In the jargon around the Internet of Things,
there's a big buzz word.

167
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:11,940
If we are going to be building things for
people with limited economic capacity we need

168
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:19,090
to be more economically aware of how our work
impacts them.

169
00:19:19,090 --> 00:19:27,740
Likewise, as we - did anyone follow the class
action lawsuit?

170
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:35,000
As we put connected technologies into realms
that we would consider to be very private

171
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:45,390
we need to make sure that we are protecting
our users' data and notions of empathy and

172
00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:51,420
notions of advocacy are all well and good,
but until - but the rubber hits the road when

173
00:19:51,420 --> 00:20:01,940
we are in this very intimate and necessarily
trustworthy place.

174
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:10,370
And this is the argument I always make to
my clients: it's that we shouldn't discount

175
00:20:10,370 --> 00:20:18,710
even as generalist or tinkerer devs, if they
cannot rock your security tool then we are

176
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:24,870
not going to have security, and we need to
invest in design and documentation that does

177
00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:32,950
accommodate a larger span of users, even when
those users are not what we consider to be

178
00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:40,810
traditional devs or traditional implementers
of security.

179
00:20:40,810 --> 00:20:47,920
This is a big task and I think it's something
that will require rebuilding trust not only

180
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:58,050
amongst new folks coming in but also amongst
the long range users of our products and at

181
00:20:58,050 --> 00:21:06,210
every level of software and hardware development,
so what do we do next?

182
00:21:06,210 --> 00:21:08,590
Where do we go from here?

183
00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:18,860
This will probably be no surprise to you but
I advocate for understanding developer experiences

184
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:21,370
in every step of the process.

185
00:21:21,370 --> 00:21:28,090
If you are working on a roll your own tool,
put it in front of other people and do this

186
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:31,070
early and often.

187
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:40,140
IBM did these studies in the early 1990s that
said that there's a 20/1 ROI on investments

188
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:48,720
and usability and that ROI number was increased
earlier on in the process.

189
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:55,410
Usability testing is huge, and bringing your
users in, making a more participatory stance

190
00:21:55,410 --> 00:22:02,090
when developing your tools and their documentation,
and I think that organisations as a whole

191
00:22:02,090 --> 00:22:07,810
can invest in understanding these differences
in values and skill sets.

192
00:22:07,810 --> 00:22:14,430
Because ultimately I hope that we can work
from a standpoint of the ethics of care.

193
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:20,480
This is a big project that I have been working
on conjointly, but how do we see our work

194
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:25,600
as caring for our users, not just giving them
something cool to use?

195
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:30,230
And I think that this is something that we
can bring to our work and that reminds us

196
00:22:30,230 --> 00:22:33,940
of how important what we are doing actually
is.

197
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:37,390
Lastly, let's work together.

198
00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:47,630
I recently started a programme called UX Night
School bringing design research tools to developers

199
00:22:47,630 --> 00:22:50,770
and designers in the field and I would love
to work with you, so thanks.
