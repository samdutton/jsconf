00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:35,050

my name is Jeremy Johnstone and a little

2
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:36,730
bit of background about me I actually

3
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:39,060
worked for Yahoo for almost six years I

4
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:41,050
started off in the address book team

5
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:42,820
went over into male team worked in the

6
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:44,950
messenger but most importantly I worked

7
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:46,270
in the connected TV team which is what

8
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:49,000
this topic of this talk is about today I

9
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,370
actually left yahoo on April first of

10
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:52,870
this year and I'm now currently a

11
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:54,340
developer advocate for the LinkedIn's

12
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:57,580
platform team while at Yahoo as i said i

13
00:00:57,580 --> 00:00:59,020
was on the connected to each b team I

14
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:00,460
was on the team for a little over two

15
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:02,710
years helped launch and basically

16
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:05,770
promote the platform through CES in 2009

17
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:08,170
continuing on from there and then i also

18
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:09,820
i have a long history of working with

19
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:11,290
javascript in many different platforms

20
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:13,300
from you know server-side nodejs and

21
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:14,770
doing rhinos with stuff and writing

22
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:16,780
parsers for javascript and PHP and

23
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:18,970
pretty much every exciting and crazy

24
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:20,259
thing you can possibly think of what

25
00:01:20,259 --> 00:01:21,580
javascript I've done it at some point in

26
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:24,880
time so first of all I kind of want to

27
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,259
start off who has actually heard of

28
00:01:26,259 --> 00:01:28,710
Yahoo connected TV in the audience here

29
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:31,690
surprisingly few it's actually it's

30
00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:33,700
really sad that there isn't more people

31
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:34,960
out there that know about Yahoo

32
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,850
connected TV because frankly in my

33
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:38,140
opinion is one of the most exciting

34
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:40,390
platforms right now for JavaScript it

35
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:42,700
allows you to basically do all of the

36
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:43,720
things you've been doing in the web

37
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:44,800
browser all the things you've been doing

38
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,780
on the server side with no Jas but do it

39
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:49,179
actually on your television and do it to

40
00:01:49,179 --> 00:01:50,890
enhance the TV watching experience and

41
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:53,050
not basically try to replace it like

42
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:54,429
some of the other products have done in

43
00:01:54,429 --> 00:01:56,770
the space but instead just actually kind

44
00:01:56,770 --> 00:01:58,569
of combine and bring in new content new

45
00:01:58,569 --> 00:02:00,099
services that actually enhance people's

46
00:02:00,099 --> 00:02:02,050
watching TV watching experience because

47
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:03,580
frankly most people when they actually

48
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:05,229
fire up the TV they don't want to browse

49
00:02:05,229 --> 00:02:06,310
the internet they don't want to pull up

50
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:08,229
a web browser they you know your average

51
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:10,569
mom in Kansas doesn't even understand

52
00:02:10,569 --> 00:02:12,580
how to use you know a wiimote to be able

53
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:13,959
to point on the screen let alone do

54
00:02:13,959 --> 00:02:15,790
anything else what they want to be able

55
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:17,410
to do is just get to the content that

56
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:19,930
makes the most sense to them and with

57
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:21,819
JavaScript on the TV's you can actually

58
00:02:21,819 --> 00:02:23,560
bring on all these developers like

59
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,510
yourselves that have experienced and get

60
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:28,209
up and going quickly and easily so first

61
00:02:28,209 --> 00:02:30,160
of all just kind of a brief agenda here

62
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,020
I'm going to kind of cover what is Yahoo

63
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:33,220
connected TV for those of you who

64
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:36,099
haven't heard of it before I will also

65
00:02:36,099 --> 00:02:37,569
cover why would you want to develop a

66
00:02:37,569 --> 00:02:39,099
widget obviously that's an important

67
00:02:39,099 --> 00:02:41,560
question and then first well after that

68
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,030
will kind of get into like how do we

69
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:44,590
actually develop a widget and what is

70
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:45,460
the environment like and

71
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:47,290
how do you get up and running and then

72
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:48,760
finally I'll conclude with what you can

73
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,350
do with widgets in general and just give

74
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:53,320
you some examples of some that so first

75
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:55,090
of all JavaScript on televisions who's

76
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:57,010
ever heard of something like that well I

77
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:58,480
mean we've already have it on browsers

78
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,400
um you know pretty much every browser

79
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,990
out there under the Sun supports

80
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:03,640
javascript now we have into mobile

81
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,230
devices from the iphone all the way to

82
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:07,270
you know the first class support that's

83
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:09,670
in the touch pads that are out coming

84
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:14,170
from what webos pads we also have on the

85
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:15,940
server side with no Jas and then a bunch

86
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:18,160
of competing solutions out there but so

87
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:20,680
why not TVs and in this example right

88
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,970
here in the bottom right hand corner

89
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:24,070
you'll actually see an example kind of

90
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:26,500
the experience so what this is is a full

91
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,360
screen widget here that actually has a

92
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,770
TV signal that's over on the left-hand

93
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:31,480
side so if you see that little box kind

94
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:32,860
of this being outline on the screen that

95
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:35,560
is actually TV signal i'm showing a

96
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,180
world cup game and then here you

97
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:39,430
actually have a ability to see like some

98
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:40,870
stats about different games that are

99
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:42,670
going on and then it across the bottom

100
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:43,870
you see all the different games of the

101
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:45,190
World Cup and you can actually go in and

102
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:46,600
select which one and see the stats we

103
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,010
see the current scores are things like

104
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:50,050
this and this was a widget that actually

105
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:52,090
launched last summer basically to

106
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:56,470
coincide with the world cup so what is

107
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:58,630
connected TV first of all it's based on

108
00:03:58,630 --> 00:03:59,890
confabulate ur who here in the audience

109
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:02,500
has ever heard of compact later quite a

110
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,480
bit more hands there so confabulate ur

111
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,830
as everybody knows is the widget engine

112
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:08,020
that ran on mac and windows it was

113
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:10,930
brainchild of our larose and ed and

114
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:13,300
basically what they did was they brought

115
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:15,520
a kind of like the precursor to

116
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,840
Dashboard widgets so you know for all

117
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:19,090
the mac users out there to both windows

118
00:04:19,090 --> 00:04:21,520
and mac users what we actually did at

119
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:23,710
yahoo is we went in and modified

120
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:25,180
confabulate ER ported it to run on an

121
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:27,370
embedded linux system so all the tvs

122
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:29,410
that have been sold since 2009 your mid

123
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:31,720
to high-end tvs from samsung sony's LG

124
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:34,270
vizio toshiba they've actually have been

125
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:36,520
linux running on the televisions what we

126
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,480
did was we actually got the

127
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,340
manufacturers to all go in and port and

128
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:41,610
put in confabulate Iran to the platform

129
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:44,230
confabulate er if any of you have not

130
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:46,210
used it before its uses spidermonkey

131
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:49,370
internally for its JavaScript engine it

132
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:51,080
as part of the development for TV

133
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:53,300
widgets we went in and architected a con

134
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:55,699
TX framework it's loosely based on the

135
00:04:55,699 --> 00:04:58,250
mood tools class pattern allows people

136
00:04:58,250 --> 00:04:59,780
who have some experience with mootools

137
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:01,160
to jump right in and immediately get

138
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:03,050
going but at the same time if you're not

139
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:04,940
familiar with it it is basic JavaScript

140
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:07,490
and it allows you to pretty much do

141
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:08,540
anything you want to do on the platform

142
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:10,580
it quickly and easily and then as I

143
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:12,830
mentioned previously six out of ten of

144
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:15,320
the top TV manufacturers out there are

145
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,510
now actually running connected TV on

146
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:19,340
their devices with the tvs that they

147
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:22,970
sell so why would you want to develop a

148
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:25,370
TV widget first of all is market

149
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:27,320
distribution currently right now there

150
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,479
are over 70 models of tv's + 135

151
00:05:29,479 --> 00:05:31,840
countries with over 8 million tvs

152
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,250
current status of this morning that are

153
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:36,860
in the field obviously with that kind of

154
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:38,750
adoption and that many devices out there

155
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:40,910
you have a broad reach that you can

156
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:43,250
actually have your platform and then on

157
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:44,840
top of that with some of the new things

158
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,400
that are getting ready to launch like

159
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,380
the App Store that yahoo announced back

160
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:51,110
at CES in January of this year you can

161
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:52,340
actually even charge for your widgets

162
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:54,889
make connie directly from the widgets by

163
00:05:54,889 --> 00:05:57,650
selling your content obviously you know

164
00:05:57,650 --> 00:05:59,090
we're all here at jay's comp I don't

165
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:00,590
need to reiterate this much too much but

166
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:02,690
it's javascript javascript rules so why

167
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:03,710
would you not want to develop something

168
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:06,590
on the platform it's also easy to get up

169
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:08,270
and running everything there's an

170
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:09,560
integrated development environment that

171
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,410
i want to show you here that runs on the

172
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:14,870
mac or windows or linux and it's easy to

173
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:16,940
go in and quickly develop a widget it's

174
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:19,130
an open platform so anybody at any

175
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:20,599
company can go in and develop a widget

176
00:06:20,599 --> 00:06:23,180
you don't actually have to like strike

177
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:24,349
partnership agreements with Yahoo

178
00:06:24,349 --> 00:06:26,599
they're pretty much any widget that can

179
00:06:26,599 --> 00:06:28,490
actually pass the QA process can be

180
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:30,889
launched on the platform and then of

181
00:06:30,889 --> 00:06:33,020
course you know no presentation would be

182
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:35,510
complete without the gnome business plan

183
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:42,020
build a widget ? profit so what does it

184
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:43,820
take to actually develop a connected TV

185
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:46,220
widget so first of all you have to have

186
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:47,930
a computer I mean that's pretty much no

187
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:49,610
brainer there I'm a text editor of any

188
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:50,720
sort and whatever your personal

189
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,970
preferences I use textmate but you can

190
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:54,410
use whatever you would like and then a

191
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:55,789
virtual machine the two that are

192
00:06:55,789 --> 00:06:58,400
supported our vmware and virtual box but

193
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,870
you could obviously if you have

194
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:01,010
familiarity you could probably get up

195
00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:02,060
and running with just about anything

196
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:03,710
anything that can run a new bun

197
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:06,800
to vm image then also you need to get

198
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,750
the Yahoo TV widget WD k something you

199
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:10,130
can download from connected TV that

200
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:12,710
yahoo com and quick and easy get up and

201
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:14,450
going obviously you have to know

202
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:17,390
javascript it's something that a lot of

203
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:21,320
people out there they especially when

204
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,490
i've been doing a lot of the customer

205
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:23,510
support in the forms a lot of people

206
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:25,370
think well I understand jQuery so I

207
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:26,900
understand JavaScript well that's not

208
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:29,150
exactly the case jquery is obviously

209
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:30,530
written in javascript but you do need to

210
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:31,850
understand JavaScript especially

211
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:33,320
javascript outside of the browser model

212
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,930
so if you've done javascript in nodejs

213
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:37,730
or other places like this you'll fit

214
00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:40,700
right in also additionally it helps to

215
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:42,500
have a TV that's supported for testing I

216
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,120
was actually supposed to have several

217
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,710
models of TVs up here onstage with me

218
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:47,810
today but they didn't make it but

219
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:49,370
they're not required but it does make it

220
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:51,740
easier for testing purposes and then

221
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:53,360
also a vision for an awesome widget and

222
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,430
the purpose of a TV widget is not to

223
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:59,060
bring like a web page into your TV is to

224
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:00,620
actually bring internet content into an

225
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:02,030
environment that's actually geared

226
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:04,580
towards and kind of socially acceptable

227
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:06,620
for the TV watching environment so for

228
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:08,060
example you know when you're sitting

229
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:09,170
down with your family you want to be

230
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:11,030
able to go in and find content on the

231
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:13,070
internet that is actually like quickly

232
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:14,540
accessible and is in point-and-click

233
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:15,980
fashion that you don't have to do a

234
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:18,080
whole lot of you know remote

235
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,370
interactions to be able to get to the

236
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:23,150
content so the example that i'm going to

237
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:25,430
give today is a linkedin network

238
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:27,230
streaming widget what this widget does

239
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:29,660
is it is a great example of consuming a

240
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:32,750
rest-based API basically anybody who has

241
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:34,580
an existing api out there you can

242
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:36,470
quickly go and throw up a TV widget

243
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:38,780
based around this API I spent maybe

244
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:40,460
three or four days total working on this

245
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:42,230
and most of that time was actually

246
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:43,850
working on getting an OAuth library

247
00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:45,860
poured it into the network dong

248
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:47,750
confabulate ER unfortunately there

249
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:49,760
wasn't any good pre built libraries that

250
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:52,640
worked inside of that environment as I

251
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,840
mentioned with OAuth it is a great

252
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:56,450
example of handling OAuth UX in a widget

253
00:08:56,450 --> 00:08:59,390
so basically you have to go in and be

254
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:01,640
able to you know do out-of-band Oh auth

255
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,530
and how do you message that to the user

256
00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:04,580
how do you make it easier for the user

257
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:06,680
to put in their pin code so this will be

258
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,780
an example of one way of doing that it

259
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:10,670
also shows an example of a full-screen

260
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:12,770
environment so what you can actually do

261
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:14,840
is is normally and I'll show you some of

262
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:17,030
the examples when we get to the demo

263
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:18,710
normally a widget is in a sidebar so

264
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:20,210
it's kind of sitting on top of the TV

265
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:22,520
watching experience so by in the full

266
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,320
screen mode you can actually replace the

267
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,030
entire TV screen with your own content

268
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:28,040
but in this case we're doing it in TV

269
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,510
overlay mode which means that we're

270
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:31,100
laying some content on top of the TV

271
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:33,770
experience so as we'll see in the demo

272
00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:35,750
it's actually a ticker bar that shows

273
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:37,070
across the bottom the screen and it

274
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:38,510
shows your network updates from people

275
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:41,960
that you have on linkedin so why

276
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:44,840
linkedin linkedin right now is currently

277
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:47,000
the professional identity for most

278
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,800
people on the web if you have a

279
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,390
professional identity you won't have

280
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:52,310
your resume your contacts everybody

281
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:54,260
predominantly speaking goes to LinkedIn

282
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,460
and LinkedIn is the source of truth for

283
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:57,410
that it's also a great place to go and

284
00:09:57,410 --> 00:09:58,910
find out more information and insights

285
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:01,250
about your your work environment and

286
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:03,740
also to be able to you know learn new

287
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:05,150
things that will help you further your

288
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:07,190
career has over 100 million users around

289
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:09,770
the world obviously I'm on the platform

290
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:11,210
team so I'm a little bit biased here but

291
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:12,740
it has a powerful platform that allows

292
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:14,690
you to be able to drill in and get a lot

293
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:16,810
of information a lot of resources

294
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:18,800
obviously you know widget didn't exist

295
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,300
yet so it also seemed like a good target

296
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:22,490
and it's where I work so I kind of have

297
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:25,330
to go through my employer bone there too

298
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:29,150
so all right we're interested so how do

299
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:38,570
we actually build a widget alright first

300
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:39,920
of all here you'll see that i have

301
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,440
vmware fusion up and running vmware

302
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,390
fusion em is what i'm actually using but

303
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:46,160
i have also used virtualbox extensively

304
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,950
I you can actually if you go and look on

305
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:50,540
the blog or look on the connected TV

306
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:51,830
blog or look in the forums I actually

307
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:53,630
have some VirtualBox scripts that

308
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:55,220
actually allow you to get up and going

309
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:57,680
real easily with vagrant but right now

310
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,650
today I'm just using vmware fusion

311
00:10:59,650 --> 00:11:01,820
following the install instructions that

312
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:04,160
are available on the website so i

313
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,600
actually have one small problem

314
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,210
currently right now with the OAuth

315
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:09,620
script that I was not able to fix in

316
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:11,360
time so I'm going to cheat just a little

317
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:32,620
bit here forgive me

318
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:35,270
ok

319
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:37,640
and now so to actually start off the

320
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:39,290
widget environment what you would first

321
00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:40,670
of all you would go in and download the

322
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:42,200
VirtualBox image this is a

323
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,600
pre-configured image or a vmware image

324
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,160
that allows you to be able to get up and

325
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,210
running with ubuntu without having to

326
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:48,500
worry about installing ubuntu installing

327
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,360
the dependency packages and everything

328
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:52,130
so it's a prebuilt image that's

329
00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:54,080
available off of the connected TV

330
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,060
website then after you would do that you

331
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:57,650
would install the WD playtest version of

332
00:11:57,650 --> 00:12:00,650
the WD k it's just a standard package

333
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:03,050
there and then after you have that

334
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:04,460
you'll actually see that inside the

335
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:05,960
application menu you have a tea widgets

336
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,520
menu and here we're just going to fire

337
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:11,960
off the latest production simulator so

338
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:14,780
here's actually in the widget experience

339
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:16,010
this is what similar to what it would

340
00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:17,270
look like if you're actually running on

341
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:18,950
your television screen so pretend this

342
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:20,600
black space right here it would actually

343
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,880
be the TV signal unfortunately I don't

344
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,190
have a TV tuner card on this laptop so I

345
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:27,020
can't actually show you a simulated TV

346
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:29,300
experience but just pretend that the

347
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:31,670
black is a TV along the bottom here we

348
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:33,890
have what's called the widget doc this

349
00:12:33,890 --> 00:12:35,450
is examples of all the different widgets

350
00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:38,120
that are running on the platform and you

351
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,890
can go in and just these are all the

352
00:12:39,890 --> 00:12:41,000
default widgets to come with a TV

353
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,380
simulator but there's also a ton of

354
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:43,790
other sample code and widget so you can

355
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:46,310
get out there so first of all I'm going

356
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:47,690
to go ahead and select that LinkedIn

357
00:12:47,690 --> 00:12:49,790
widget so when we load up in here we can

358
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:50,750
actually see that we have a sidebar

359
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:53,210
experience so again this is laying on

360
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:54,950
top of the TV signal so you would

361
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:58,400
actually be able to see the sidebar

362
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,840
there and then it'll just be laying on

363
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:02,300
top of your TV now it's also possible to

364
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:04,280
do a picture in picture mode so it's

365
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,720
kind of hard to see on this projector

366
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:07,580
screen here but if you can see there's

367
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:09,050
kind of a crosshatch on the right-hand

368
00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:10,670
side now and then the TV is actually put

369
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:12,200
into a picture and picture off to the

370
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:15,770
side so either way it works both ways so

371
00:13:15,770 --> 00:13:17,240
first thing we need to do is we need to

372
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:19,250
sign into LinkedIn I need to be able to

373
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:21,050
get an OAuth token so that way we can

374
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:22,070
actually make the request to get the

375
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:24,380
network updates so here I'm gonna go

376
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:28,160
ahead and do that so here we see an

377
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,140
experience at kind of one example of a

378
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:34,730
UX experience here so here we just have

379
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:36,560
some standard text I have a URL that I

380
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:39,980
need to pull up in my PC that's separate

381
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:50,030
from my television

382
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:54,629
and by doing that I'm now shown the

383
00:13:54,629 --> 00:14:11,480
login page here

384
00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:14,250
and we're given a five digit code so 3 4

385
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:17,459
5 30 so what we're going to do is type

386
00:14:17,459 --> 00:14:25,830
in that code and now that we've typed in

387
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:27,089
the code we click verify code with

388
00:14:27,089 --> 00:14:29,520
LinkedIn and boom we come right back to

389
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:30,750
the main screen again and now you'll see

390
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:31,950
that the Sign In button is actually

391
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:33,600
disabled and now we have the stream

392
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,580
network updates so stream network

393
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:36,959
updates if I go ahead and hit enter on

394
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:40,320
that will see that the sidebar

395
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,000
experience is put away and in now we're

396
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,890
in a full screen mode the TV would be

397
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:45,390
still playing here in the background and

398
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:46,950
then we have a ticker bar that shows the

399
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:48,209
linkedin updates that are going across

400
00:14:48,209 --> 00:14:50,250
the bottom of the screen so you actually

401
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:51,750
do tons of different things with this

402
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:52,980
you could have like a twitter feed

403
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:54,480
that's pulling across the screen here

404
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,790
you could go in and put up like maybe I

405
00:14:56,790 --> 00:14:59,490
am Tok pop-up windows and say like maybe

406
00:14:59,490 --> 00:15:00,600
you want to initiate a chat while you're

407
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:03,450
watching TV you could have it to where

408
00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:05,279
it's detecting what you're currently

409
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:06,570
watching on the television screen and

410
00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:08,279
showing more information or more content

411
00:15:08,279 --> 00:15:09,720
about the TV show that you're watching

412
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,399
so say maybe you're watching loss and

413
00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:12,930
you want to see some relevant news about

414
00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:14,520
lost you could have a widget that goes

415
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:16,529
in and shows you know ticker information

416
00:15:16,529 --> 00:15:19,920
about that so that is the experience

417
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,290
there so let's actually dig in now and

418
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:23,430
look at some of the code that makes this

419
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:30,570
work so everybody can read that font

420
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:33,720
size big enough there so first of all

421
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:36,060
there's a widget dot XML this is kind of

422
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:38,399
a description file that goes in and sets

423
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:39,570
up some meta information about your

424
00:15:39,570 --> 00:15:42,420
widget in the I'll actually show you a

425
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:44,010
link to a github repository that shows

426
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:45,660
you a template version of the widget and

427
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:47,100
then this way you can actually go in and

428
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:49,200
just cut being pasted in the relevant

429
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,029
values but essentially what we're doing

430
00:15:51,029 --> 00:15:52,380
is we're giving it an a unique

431
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:54,240
identifier we're giving it a version

432
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:57,480
number and name who wrote it copyright

433
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:58,920
and some description information and

434
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:03,240
then some icon images then so when a

435
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,560
widget starts up the very first thing

436
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,720
that it loads is the main TV file so

437
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,700
what we've actually done is in if

438
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:09,870
anybody has actually developed a

439
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:11,040
confabulated widget before you

440
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,779
understand that them one of the main

441
00:16:12,779 --> 00:16:14,100
ways that you did that in the past was

442
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:15,660
you go in and create a whole bunch of

443
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:17,220
XML markup and then you'd throw in a

444
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:18,720
little bit of JavaScript you throw in a

445
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,100
little bit of styling information and

446
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:21,959
then you would actually have your widget

447
00:16:21,959 --> 00:16:23,579
we found that that was actually more

448
00:16:23,579 --> 00:16:24,089
complex

449
00:16:24,089 --> 00:16:25,470
for people to actually get up and

450
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:27,269
running with her TV widgets and instead

451
00:16:27,269 --> 00:16:28,620
we wanted to have a standardized look

452
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:30,990
and feel like buttons look vaguely

453
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:33,029
similar to the same we had a whole bunch

454
00:16:33,029 --> 00:16:34,589
of controls so what we've done is we've

455
00:16:34,589 --> 00:16:36,480
actually removed almost all of the XML

456
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,519
artifacts from developing and can a

457
00:16:38,519 --> 00:16:40,920
confabulation and instead have it all

458
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:43,199
done through JavaScript and rain during

459
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:45,480
in real time from JavaScript so the only

460
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:47,970
pieces actually left of the XML

461
00:16:47,970 --> 00:16:49,680
experiences is we have to have the

462
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:50,970
widget tag and then tell it to load the

463
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:53,759
script so in this script here which is

464
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:56,309
the jas what we're doing is we're

465
00:16:56,309 --> 00:16:58,139
pulling in the context framework so

466
00:16:58,139 --> 00:16:59,850
right here this first line you'll see

467
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:01,410
the include line that pulls in the

468
00:17:01,410 --> 00:17:03,899
framework then we're going in and

469
00:17:03,899 --> 00:17:05,549
pulling in some event handlers some API

470
00:17:05,549 --> 00:17:07,260
this is just custom code that belongs to

471
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:09,630
this widget pulling at an OAuth library

472
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:12,839
pulling in base 64 support and then also

473
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:15,480
we're loading up four different views so

474
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,799
if you remember back when we were

475
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:18,899
actually looking at this widget there

476
00:17:18,899 --> 00:17:20,309
was number one was a snippet so that's

477
00:17:20,309 --> 00:17:22,319
one view then when we went into the

478
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:24,270
sidebar experience there was like a main

479
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:25,890
screen so that's the main right there

480
00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:28,199
the ticker is the full screen view that

481
00:17:28,199 --> 00:17:29,640
actually has the ticker bar going across

482
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:32,279
the bottom of it and then Oh auth is the

483
00:17:32,279 --> 00:17:34,350
actual oo off-screen where we actually

484
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:37,260
did the out-of-band authorization in the

485
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:40,230
pin code so here we actually get into

486
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:41,850
some of the first actual pieces of the

487
00:17:41,850 --> 00:17:44,010
framework code so first of all here

488
00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:45,539
we're going to do what we're doing is

489
00:17:45,539 --> 00:17:46,679
we're actually starting up an

490
00:17:46,679 --> 00:17:47,669
application and creating a new

491
00:17:47,669 --> 00:17:49,320
application and we're telling the

492
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:51,240
application what the views are so in

493
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,770
this case we're just mapping a view ID

494
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:55,620
to a specific view class so classes are

495
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:57,000
something that's reusable so maybe I had

496
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,590
three different ticker screens and they

497
00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:00,270
all had different content I could

498
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:01,559
actually go in and specify three

499
00:18:01,559 --> 00:18:03,029
different IDs and all have them from the

500
00:18:03,029 --> 00:18:04,529
same view class and then they could

501
00:18:04,529 --> 00:18:06,419
actually internally switch based off of

502
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:10,289
what's going on in in that view then a

503
00:18:10,289 --> 00:18:12,179
couple default things we have to set up

504
00:18:12,179 --> 00:18:13,620
is we have to tell it what is the view

505
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:15,659
ID for the default view in this case

506
00:18:15,659 --> 00:18:18,419
it's the view main so this way whenever

507
00:18:18,419 --> 00:18:20,370
if you hit on the top title bar or if

508
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:23,159
you are navigating inside the widget and

509
00:18:23,159 --> 00:18:24,419
you need to get back to the home of the

510
00:18:24,419 --> 00:18:26,490
widget this is currently the home screen

511
00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:28,169
of that of your application that you're

512
00:18:28,169 --> 00:18:30,899
developing then the settings video ID we

513
00:18:30,899 --> 00:18:32,250
need to know which one is your settings

514
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:34,440
view in this case the settings view for

515
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:35,700
this widget which I can go back and show

516
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:37,470
you it's just a simple about box that

517
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:37,950
says something

518
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,389
mation about the widget but if you had

519
00:18:39,389 --> 00:18:41,519
more detailed settings there's actually

520
00:18:41,519 --> 00:18:42,840
a green button that you can press on

521
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:44,039
your remote control to get into the

522
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:45,840
settings we have to obviously know then

523
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,039
which one is your settings view so when

524
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:48,210
the user hits a green button we can

525
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:51,419
automatically send them there so let's

526
00:18:51,419 --> 00:18:53,039
actually go in and kind of dissect one

527
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:54,450
of these views so we'll look at the most

528
00:18:54,450 --> 00:18:57,269
basic one first this first one here is

529
00:18:57,269 --> 00:18:59,159
going to be the snippet view the snippet

530
00:18:59,159 --> 00:19:01,710
view as you can see we're just going in

531
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:04,399
and we are creating a new context class

532
00:19:04,399 --> 00:19:06,630
as I said those of you who have used

533
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:08,580
mootools you'll see that there's a bit

534
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:10,860
of similarity here we're actually using

535
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:12,899
kind of a pseudo classical inheritance

536
00:19:12,899 --> 00:19:14,760
inside the framework so we're extending

537
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:17,309
from context context system anchor

538
00:19:17,309 --> 00:19:19,139
snippet view so an anchor snippet view

539
00:19:19,139 --> 00:19:20,880
is something that's always in the dock

540
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,070
and you know widget can actually have

541
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:24,179
multiple snippets that the user can

542
00:19:24,179 --> 00:19:26,010
scroll through whenever they're on your

543
00:19:26,010 --> 00:19:28,919
position in the dock so additional ones

544
00:19:28,919 --> 00:19:30,059
that you could have like there may be

545
00:19:30,059 --> 00:19:31,799
added real time would be like a profile

546
00:19:31,799 --> 00:19:34,169
snippet view so for example say I was in

547
00:19:34,169 --> 00:19:35,880
the news widget if I wanted to be able

548
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,679
to bookmark a specific category so I can

549
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:39,630
get in faster to that category I could

550
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:40,519
hit a button on my remote control

551
00:19:40,519 --> 00:19:42,630
bookmark that and then that would be a

552
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:43,950
profile snippet view because it's tied

553
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:47,220
to my specific user on the TV now each

554
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:49,260
one of the views and the view life cycle

555
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:51,539
there is a knit view there's a create

556
00:19:51,539 --> 00:19:53,820
view and an update view a knit view is

557
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:55,649
kind of like an initialized method it's

558
00:19:55,649 --> 00:19:57,149
anything that you need to do when your

559
00:19:57,149 --> 00:19:58,919
class is first substantial for the first

560
00:19:58,919 --> 00:20:00,809
time you would put that inside the net

561
00:20:00,809 --> 00:20:03,539
view create view is the method that's

562
00:20:03,539 --> 00:20:06,480
called whenever you when your your view

563
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,710
is actually first shown for the first

564
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:10,049
time so this is where you actually go in

565
00:20:10,049 --> 00:20:12,090
and render all the basically the Dom

566
00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:13,529
nodes that would be going into the DOM

567
00:20:13,529 --> 00:20:15,450
and in this case for the snippet view is

568
00:20:15,450 --> 00:20:17,220
simply just a single image that's being

569
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:19,409
put into the DOM and then update view is

570
00:20:19,409 --> 00:20:21,000
actually called every single time your

571
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,679
view is updated so if I go to the main

572
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:24,690
view then go to the OAuth view and then

573
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:26,789
come back to the main view my update

574
00:20:26,789 --> 00:20:28,200
view call would get called the first

575
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,940
time whenever I first load it in and

576
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:31,559
then the second time after I came back

577
00:20:31,559 --> 00:20:33,299
from the OAuth view and I'll show you

578
00:20:33,299 --> 00:20:36,659
some more of that in a bit again there's

579
00:20:36,659 --> 00:20:38,220
actually standardized controls for

580
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:39,450
putting in most of the elements on the

581
00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:41,250
screen so in this case here where it is

582
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:42,929
creating a new image and we're giving it

583
00:20:42,929 --> 00:20:45,149
a source setting some be offset and H

584
00:20:45,149 --> 00:20:47,010
offsets and then appending it into the

585
00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:50,970
Dom for the window

586
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:53,620
the main view has a little bit more meat

587
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:57,250
to it first of all there is a several

588
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:59,320
images that make up this view so when

589
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:00,880
we're actually in there I'll go back and

590
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:03,370
show you there's a image for the logo

591
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:05,290
that goes across the top there's another

592
00:21:05,290 --> 00:21:07,030
image for the fade that kind of does a

593
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:09,580
menu on the background there's also a

594
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:13,960
reflection which is the is actually the

595
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:15,370
reflection of the image that's shown up

596
00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:16,840
on the screen there and then what we're

597
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:18,130
doing is we're setting kind of an

598
00:21:18,130 --> 00:21:19,720
opacity a point for so that way it's a

599
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:22,419
little bit dim down and unfortunately

600
00:21:22,419 --> 00:21:23,530
reflection is something that is

601
00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:25,090
entrapped into the framework as easy

602
00:21:25,090 --> 00:21:27,460
helper method so this is the two lines

603
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:28,990
of code that you would do to actually

604
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:30,760
reflect that image and flip it upside

605
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:31,840
down so that way it gives kind of a

606
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:35,470
reflection effect to it then basically

607
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:37,240
we have a text element that goes in and

608
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:38,740
puts some text on the screen in this

609
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:40,030
case get the most from your professional

610
00:21:40,030 --> 00:21:42,549
network we put a little of a shadow set

611
00:21:42,549 --> 00:21:44,650
the font sizes colors pretty standard

612
00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:47,820
stuff there for similar to CSS for that

613
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:50,590
then we create two buttons in this case

614
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:51,700
here we're actually creating text

615
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:52,900
buttons which is just a button that has

616
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:55,900
a text label on it we're giving a class

617
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:57,700
name of control mini button which is a

618
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:59,200
way to be able to make the fat buttons

619
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,280
that you would normally see in a menu

620
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:02,679
section and we set some labels and then

621
00:22:02,679 --> 00:22:04,720
we actually set up an events block for

622
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:07,690
whenever the events are fired so in this

623
00:22:07,690 --> 00:22:09,760
case here we're firing a non-selective

624
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,290
int whenever the button is actually

625
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:13,720
pressed by the user and here we're

626
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:15,070
actually going to say just load this

627
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:17,350
view which is the view auth so if you

628
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:19,419
remember back to the net j/s we're

629
00:22:19,419 --> 00:22:20,860
setting up like kind of a string ID

630
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:22,900
matching to the view well here's an

631
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:24,549
example of one of those being used and

632
00:22:24,549 --> 00:22:26,140
that's where we're actually telling it

633
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:27,910
to go in and load the OAuth view

634
00:22:27,910 --> 00:22:30,820
whatever that Brett in this pressed the

635
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:33,940
next thing that we do here is we in for

636
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:35,590
entering into the full screen mode we're

637
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:38,710
going to go in and same thing same setup

638
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:40,059
as a button here but in this case we're

639
00:22:40,059 --> 00:22:42,960
going to load on the view dash ticker

640
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,580
because it doesn't look good on the

641
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:46,690
screen if there's a whole bunch of just

642
00:22:46,690 --> 00:22:48,730
black space we have a empty space

643
00:22:48,730 --> 00:22:49,960
control which kind of gives it a little

644
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:51,580
bit of a cross-hatched look and that

645
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:53,760
fills in the empty spaces left on there

646
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:56,290
so here you can actually see the first

647
00:22:56,290 --> 00:22:58,179
example of an update view what the

648
00:22:58,179 --> 00:23:00,130
update view does is it checks this dot

649
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:03,280
persist offed so whenever a it comes

650
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,790
back from the OAuth view

651
00:23:04,790 --> 00:23:06,620
we can actually pass parameters to the

652
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:08,840
main view so that way when it loads we

653
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:10,760
actually can pass some parameters in

654
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,740
this case when the Olaf view em is

655
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:15,020
completed it sets a off equals true

656
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:18,050
parameter and then so if we are off then

657
00:23:18,050 --> 00:23:21,170
we just disable the lay link button the

658
00:23:21,170 --> 00:23:23,420
Sign In button and we enable the

659
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:26,480
interval screen button the next thing

660
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,850
that we do here is inside the focus view

661
00:23:28,850 --> 00:23:30,680
so focus view is when your view first

662
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:32,300
gets focused so in other words a user

663
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:34,040
can control and move the you know the

664
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:35,800
blue focus up and down on the screen in

665
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:38,750
this case if it was off then we force

666
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:40,880
the focus over to the inter full screen

667
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:43,010
view otherwise the focus could actually

668
00:23:43,010 --> 00:23:44,750
be on to maybe potentially on a disable

669
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:48,230
button I'm going to kind of speed

670
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:50,420
through the OAuth button here in this

671
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:51,650
case we're just and this is a first

672
00:23:51,650 --> 00:23:53,900
example of an init view we're setting up

673
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:56,090
some ham some handlers here for

674
00:23:56,090 --> 00:23:58,100
different events that happen and we're

675
00:23:58,100 --> 00:23:59,990
setting a current position is equal to 0

676
00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:01,580
so that's the position inside of that

677
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:04,220
digit to the right we have a back button

678
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:06,440
control which is kind of gives it a

679
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:08,090
title and it also gives a quick easy way

680
00:24:08,090 --> 00:24:11,360
for the user to go back some text then

681
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,190
what we do is I'm actually creating an

682
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:14,510
element core so this is one of the most

683
00:24:14,510 --> 00:24:17,060
basic of the elements and I'm putting a

684
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:19,310
background image background position and

685
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:21,650
background repeat something you would be

686
00:24:21,650 --> 00:24:23,930
familiar from doing web dev we're

687
00:24:23,930 --> 00:24:25,100
actually going in and putting the code

688
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:27,050
background so the code background is

689
00:24:27,050 --> 00:24:29,330
actually it's just five white squares on

690
00:24:29,330 --> 00:24:31,580
the screen and then what I do is I'm

691
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:33,140
going in and creating text elements to

692
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:35,120
put on top of each one of those digits

693
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:37,340
on each one of those white boxes so that

694
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:38,720
way when a user types of digit we just

695
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,190
fill each one of these with a single

696
00:24:40,190 --> 00:24:42,110
digit so it displays on the screen there

697
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:43,220
are other ways of doing this but this

698
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:44,810
was a quick easy way to be able to get

699
00:24:44,810 --> 00:24:46,340
those five individual characters and

700
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:48,350
make sure that they did correctly center

701
00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:50,600
on the center of the white squares as

702
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:53,930
they should scroll through the rest of

703
00:24:53,930 --> 00:24:55,190
those there and then of course there's a

704
00:24:55,190 --> 00:24:56,510
submit button at the bottom so it's a

705
00:24:56,510 --> 00:24:57,470
standard text button that we've seen

706
00:24:57,470 --> 00:25:00,740
previously so the other thing that we

707
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:03,350
added as well is a keyboard so there's a

708
00:25:03,350 --> 00:25:04,700
standardized control that allows you to

709
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:05,960
be able to put an on-screen keyboard up

710
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:08,270
on the screen in the case of this one

711
00:25:08,270 --> 00:25:09,380
here that we're actually doing a pin

712
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:11,750
entry and keyboard that will also enable

713
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:14,780
the number keys on the key whenever the

714
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:16,880
user is selected on that pin there

715
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,680
they'll actually be able to type in the

716
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:20,270
birki's on their numbers on the remote

717
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:21,860
control so instead of me having to go

718
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:23,600
and select you know 34 and then move my

719
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,610
mouth the focus around I can actually

720
00:25:25,610 --> 00:25:27,890
directly just type those numbers in so

721
00:25:27,890 --> 00:25:30,190
that's another convenience helper there

722
00:25:30,190 --> 00:25:32,810
then what we do is on the events here

723
00:25:32,810 --> 00:25:35,990
for on key down what we do is we are

724
00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:38,840
creating a handle handle key press event

725
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:42,170
or I mean a callback and passing it

726
00:25:42,170 --> 00:25:44,240
biting it to the this so that weighs in

727
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:47,090
the correct I'm scope so here on the

728
00:25:47,090 --> 00:25:48,560
handle key press event and will actually

729
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:49,970
see one of our first examples of a

730
00:25:49,970 --> 00:25:52,970
full-fledged event handler so the first

731
00:25:52,970 --> 00:25:54,950
of all all events and handlers are

732
00:25:54,950 --> 00:25:57,050
always pass it an event object in this

733
00:25:57,050 --> 00:25:59,930
case there so this is a key event on the

734
00:25:59,930 --> 00:26:02,690
event payload will get a key code so if

735
00:26:02,690 --> 00:26:05,840
the key code is equal to 8 which would

736
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,940
be the backspace character there's also

737
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:11,090
handy like shortcut so you could use but

738
00:26:11,090 --> 00:26:12,350
I just use the rock key codes here

739
00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:13,220
because I happen to know them off the

740
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:15,350
top my head and then so in this case

741
00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:16,970
what we do is we just actually set the

742
00:26:16,970 --> 00:26:19,280
text back to you know empty for that box

743
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:22,330
if the user hit the backspace button

744
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:25,370
then if the key code if the key is

745
00:26:25,370 --> 00:26:27,890
greater than zero or equal to 0 or less

746
00:26:27,890 --> 00:26:29,270
than 10 in other words it's a numeric

747
00:26:29,270 --> 00:26:32,570
digit between 0 and 9 what we do is we

748
00:26:32,570 --> 00:26:34,220
actually set the text to the event

749
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:35,870
payload keys so that's what actually

750
00:26:35,870 --> 00:26:38,960
populates that box and puts a digit in

751
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:41,780
the screen if Kurt then I just do a

752
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:44,450
little bit of management here so if you

753
00:26:44,450 --> 00:26:46,070
keep hitting backspace if current

754
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:47,420
position isn't less than zero we just

755
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:48,590
set it to zero so that way it's always

756
00:26:48,590 --> 00:26:51,620
on the first box and then if current

757
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:52,850
position is greater than four in other

758
00:26:52,850 --> 00:26:54,770
words you've reached the end of the

759
00:26:54,770 --> 00:26:56,630
boxes and we just jumped the focus down

760
00:26:56,630 --> 00:26:57,680
to the submit button so that way the

761
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:58,970
user doesn't have to move down there on

762
00:26:58,970 --> 00:27:01,940
their own in the case of the handle

763
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:04,220
submit button what we do is we take the

764
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:06,140
verifier I'm just basically building up

765
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:08,330
the verifier and as I said I had a

766
00:27:08,330 --> 00:27:09,710
problem with the OAuth that I didn't get

767
00:27:09,710 --> 00:27:11,000
a chance to fully resolve so right now

768
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,220
I'm just forcing it to set the Mayo off

769
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:17,030
to be true the clear key code fields and

770
00:27:17,030 --> 00:27:18,650
all this does it just loops over all of

771
00:27:18,650 --> 00:27:20,180
the different code fields and then sets

772
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:23,840
our text to empty in the case of the set

773
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:26,159
short URL what this does is is

774
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:28,690
inside of my coat I am actually firing

775
00:27:28,690 --> 00:27:30,669
off a request to link my TV which is a

776
00:27:30,669 --> 00:27:32,640
domain of registered for this widget so

777
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:35,620
it goes in and fires off the request and

778
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:38,350
sends at the URL that he needs to be

779
00:27:38,350 --> 00:27:40,630
able to shorten and then when the short

780
00:27:40,630 --> 00:27:42,220
and euro comes back we're just going to

781
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:45,700
set JSON that URL pass it in as the set

782
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:49,450
text in this case we're actually there's

783
00:27:49,450 --> 00:27:51,010
a message center that actually allows

784
00:27:51,010 --> 00:27:52,539
you to be able to pass messages back and

785
00:27:52,539 --> 00:27:53,919
forth between views and other pieces of

786
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:55,299
your code so you're not directly

787
00:27:55,299 --> 00:27:57,159
coupling you know a view to the data

788
00:27:57,159 --> 00:27:59,909
source so in this case right here if the

789
00:27:59,909 --> 00:28:02,230
message that was broadcast is a short

790
00:28:02,230 --> 00:28:05,399
URL we go in and call this a short URL

791
00:28:05,399 --> 00:28:08,110
update you in this case we show the

792
00:28:08,110 --> 00:28:09,309
loading overlay which is that spinner

793
00:28:09,309 --> 00:28:11,679
that you saw we clear the key code

794
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:14,860
fields then we go and we get the short

795
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:16,870
you shortened URL and then when the

796
00:28:16,870 --> 00:28:19,480
callback comes back for that then or

797
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:21,250
when the message comes back that's when

798
00:28:21,250 --> 00:28:23,799
we set the value and then what I do is

799
00:28:23,799 --> 00:28:25,390
whenever the view comes in and the focus

800
00:28:25,390 --> 00:28:27,399
comes into the first time we go into

801
00:28:27,399 --> 00:28:28,899
focus the keyboard because the user you

802
00:28:28,899 --> 00:28:29,799
know the first thing they're going to do

803
00:28:29,799 --> 00:28:31,210
is be typing in the keyboards to make it

804
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:35,710
as quick and easy as they can so now the

805
00:28:35,710 --> 00:28:38,740
ticker view as unlike the main view and

806
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:39,850
the snippet view so if you look here on

807
00:28:39,850 --> 00:28:41,679
the main view it's extending from

808
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:43,659
sidebar view the snippet as I previously

809
00:28:43,659 --> 00:28:45,309
mentioned is extending from anchor

810
00:28:45,309 --> 00:28:47,020
snippet view the ticker view is

811
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:49,480
extending from full screen view so the

812
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:53,620
full screen view what we do here we have

813
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:55,390
a great view I'm basically building a

814
00:28:55,390 --> 00:28:56,590
container across the bottom of the

815
00:28:56,590 --> 00:28:59,020
screen which actually encapsulates where

816
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:01,360
the tickers are and we set a background

817
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:03,220
color so that way it has that little bit

818
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:05,860
of a white bar and then what I do is I

819
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:07,570
actually create to text elements so the

820
00:29:07,570 --> 00:29:08,919
reason why I'm creating two here is

821
00:29:08,919 --> 00:29:10,929
because if I'm scrolling one across the

822
00:29:10,929 --> 00:29:13,179
screen I may get to on that one

823
00:29:13,179 --> 00:29:14,649
completely you know off the screen

824
00:29:14,649 --> 00:29:16,990
before the next one or without was still

825
00:29:16,990 --> 00:29:18,429
having trailing text there so by having

826
00:29:18,429 --> 00:29:21,100
two different text nodes basically when

827
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:22,750
one sliding across the screen when it

828
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:24,669
gets 50 pixels off from the right-hand

829
00:29:24,669 --> 00:29:26,679
side what I do is I start the next one

830
00:29:26,679 --> 00:29:27,880
with a text note and then start

831
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:29,529
scrolling it and keeping it and just

832
00:29:29,529 --> 00:29:32,620
evenly spaced off of that and we'll get

833
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:33,669
to that code here in just a second and

834
00:29:33,669 --> 00:29:34,539
so that makes it to where you can

835
00:29:34,539 --> 00:29:36,370
actually have this neatly flowing text

836
00:29:36,370 --> 00:29:38,020
across the screen that looks like it's

837
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:39,960
constantly updating

838
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:41,980
there and I throw in a logo on the

839
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:45,220
screen now when we go into an update

840
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:48,039
view what I'm doing is a fire office a

841
00:29:48,039 --> 00:29:49,840
set full screen video mode and I'm

842
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:52,239
telling it to do a pass through so in

843
00:29:52,239 --> 00:29:53,739
this case that way the TV signal shows

844
00:29:53,739 --> 00:29:55,450
up and it doesn't have a black screen if

845
00:29:55,450 --> 00:29:56,950
there was a TV signal and device and

846
00:29:56,950 --> 00:29:59,590
then I'm also going in and just this is

847
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:01,539
a bit of cleanup that I did in my in the

848
00:30:01,539 --> 00:30:03,190
widget here for because I was expecting

849
00:30:03,190 --> 00:30:05,679
a TV to be here and that was to go in

850
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:07,600
and resize the view plane back to the

851
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,580
full size so for example and if you

852
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:10,659
remember when I put in picture and

853
00:30:10,659 --> 00:30:12,909
picture inside bar when your widget goes

854
00:30:12,909 --> 00:30:14,019
into full screen mode if you're going to

855
00:30:14,019 --> 00:30:15,730
have TV pass through you are responsible

856
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:17,590
for making sure the TV signal is the

857
00:30:17,590 --> 00:30:19,330
appropriate size for your background so

858
00:30:19,330 --> 00:30:20,769
in this case we want it to be full

859
00:30:20,769 --> 00:30:25,179
screen in the case of hide view here

860
00:30:25,179 --> 00:30:27,909
this is whenever the another example of

861
00:30:27,909 --> 00:30:30,249
a widget life cycle so when the view has

862
00:30:30,249 --> 00:30:32,799
actually taken off screen we want to

863
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:33,879
stop the ticker because otherwise that

864
00:30:33,879 --> 00:30:35,259
ticker would still be scrolling in the

865
00:30:35,259 --> 00:30:36,730
background even though the full screen

866
00:30:36,730 --> 00:30:38,440
view is not on screen so think about

867
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:40,629
your consuming CPU resources moving this

868
00:30:40,629 --> 00:30:42,070
text across the screen obviously you

869
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:43,090
don't wanna do that when the user can't

870
00:30:43,090 --> 00:30:46,059
actually see it same thing with destroy

871
00:30:46,059 --> 00:30:47,470
view destroy view is whenever your view

872
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:48,789
is being garbage collected because of

873
00:30:48,789 --> 00:30:50,440
memory management and you're off screen

874
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:52,059
and we need to go in and clean that up

875
00:30:52,059 --> 00:30:54,340
and in this case here all we're doing is

876
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:56,980
just calling kill on the animation and

877
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:59,580
then setting the animation equal to null

878
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:02,379
so when the start ticker the way this is

879
00:31:02,379 --> 00:31:03,519
actually done is using a custom

880
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:06,309
animation so with the custom animation

881
00:31:06,309 --> 00:31:09,309
I'm firing every 50 milliseconds and I'm

882
00:31:09,309 --> 00:31:11,679
telling it to update animation and then

883
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:13,179
return true in other words keep running

884
00:31:13,179 --> 00:31:15,639
the animation from there and then I call

885
00:31:15,639 --> 00:31:17,350
animator not start and I pass in the

886
00:31:17,350 --> 00:31:20,049
custom animation that we just created in

887
00:31:20,049 --> 00:31:22,330
the case of the animation update what I

888
00:31:22,330 --> 00:31:26,619
do is I go in and set the offset I'm

889
00:31:26,619 --> 00:31:28,509
just basically shifting everything over

890
00:31:28,509 --> 00:31:31,029
to pixels to the left each time that the

891
00:31:31,029 --> 00:31:33,940
every 50 milliseconds and then what i do

892
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:38,019
is i set the the ticker to if it's the

893
00:31:38,019 --> 00:31:39,879
one that's on the right hand side I set

894
00:31:39,879 --> 00:31:42,070
it to be 75 pixels offset from whatever

895
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:44,200
the outer with is in other words the far

896
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:45,429
right-hand side of the first text

897
00:31:45,429 --> 00:31:48,580
element then what we do is if it's

898
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:50,409
completely off screen then I reset it

899
00:31:50,409 --> 00:31:52,429
back off to 960 so

900
00:31:52,429 --> 00:31:54,649
a the screen as far as rendering size is

901
00:31:54,649 --> 00:31:58,789
960 x 540 in size there's kind of an odd

902
00:31:58,789 --> 00:31:59,929
semantics that most people don't realize

903
00:31:59,929 --> 00:32:02,509
that the TVs they actually are rendering

904
00:32:02,509 --> 00:32:04,909
at 1920 x 1080 but most of the graphics

905
00:32:04,909 --> 00:32:05,929
and like all the menus and everything

906
00:32:05,929 --> 00:32:07,879
are done at 960 x 540 and then there's a

907
00:32:07,879 --> 00:32:09,830
scalar inside of the TV that scales it

908
00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:12,230
up to 1920 x 1080 does a 2x in each

909
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:14,450
direction so what it's doing here is

910
00:32:14,450 --> 00:32:15,889
just moving it off screen so that way

911
00:32:15,889 --> 00:32:17,240
it'll start moving correctly again

912
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:19,869
whatever the animation starry cycles and

913
00:32:19,869 --> 00:32:21,919
then what we do here for the update

914
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:24,169
ticker text is whenever whenever it goes

915
00:32:24,169 --> 00:32:26,659
off screen we clear out the text for

916
00:32:26,659 --> 00:32:28,129
that one and then put a new network

917
00:32:28,129 --> 00:32:29,720
update into that text field so that way

918
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:30,769
when it starts scrolling on screen

919
00:32:30,769 --> 00:32:34,369
you'll see a new content region so here

920
00:32:34,369 --> 00:32:35,779
I'm actually going to go ahead and reef

921
00:32:35,779 --> 00:32:38,330
are up the simulator again and show you

922
00:32:38,330 --> 00:32:42,169
a little bit of some debugging things

923
00:32:42,169 --> 00:32:43,220
that you can do inside the switch and

924
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:44,419
show you a little bit more about the

925
00:32:44,419 --> 00:32:50,119
widget itself so here you can actually

926
00:32:50,119 --> 00:32:52,730
see there when I actually fired this off

927
00:32:52,730 --> 00:32:54,470
there's two windows that are opened this

928
00:32:54,470 --> 00:32:56,299
other one is a terminal window here so

929
00:32:56,299 --> 00:32:58,369
what the terminal window is is actually

930
00:32:58,369 --> 00:33:00,019
a live JavaScript console into your

931
00:33:00,019 --> 00:33:01,999
widget context so in this case right

932
00:33:01,999 --> 00:33:03,740
here I can see the widgets that are

933
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:06,110
running by typing / widgets I can see

934
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:07,549
that the LinkedIn widgets is in the

935
00:33:07,549 --> 00:33:08,809
number 2 widget so I'm going to go ahead

936
00:33:08,809 --> 00:33:12,649
and / widgets to and now I'm actually

937
00:33:12,649 --> 00:33:13,940
inside the same JavaScript execution

938
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:16,700
scope as the LinkedIn which is running

939
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:19,340
right there so as I mentioned you know

940
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:21,019
it's not a browser but it does have an

941
00:33:21,019 --> 00:33:23,840
actual Dom structure so here whenever I

942
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:26,480
go in and do dollar dollar which is a

943
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:27,919
shorthand for basically dumping the

944
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:30,559
document structure you can see here that

945
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:31,519
we have the widget we have the script

946
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:33,230
tag which we had originally put in in

947
00:33:33,230 --> 00:33:35,720
that main TV but we also now have some

948
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:37,669
windows in here so the one that we see

949
00:33:37,669 --> 00:33:40,129
at the moment is we have a window that's

950
00:33:40,129 --> 00:33:41,899
a snippet main in other words it's the

951
00:33:41,899 --> 00:33:43,610
snippet that we created and you can see

952
00:33:43,610 --> 00:33:45,049
that there's an image object in here

953
00:33:45,049 --> 00:33:46,700
which as you remember we actually

954
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:48,259
created a JavaScript image object well

955
00:33:48,259 --> 00:33:49,399
this is actually putting the image

956
00:33:49,399 --> 00:33:51,409
object directly into this into the page

957
00:33:51,409 --> 00:33:53,570
there and creating the Dom nodes that

958
00:33:53,570 --> 00:33:55,999
are relevant so when we go into the

959
00:33:55,999 --> 00:34:03,350
sidebar here if I do that again

960
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:04,380
you'll see that there's a lot more

961
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:06,870
elements on the screen now so there is

962
00:34:06,870 --> 00:34:08,850
frames which you could kind of like into

963
00:34:08,850 --> 00:34:11,790
a div or to a span in in a browser world

964
00:34:11,790 --> 00:34:14,129
there's images there's text nodes and

965
00:34:14,129 --> 00:34:15,359
then that's what actually creates the

966
00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:18,270
markup for that page there so an example

967
00:34:18,270 --> 00:34:19,980
of something that just just to prove

968
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:21,600
that this is a live environment here

969
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:23,609
what I'm going to do is I'm going to go

970
00:34:23,609 --> 00:34:47,460
ahead

971
00:34:47,470 --> 00:34:49,429
first what I'm going to do is I'm going

972
00:34:49,429 --> 00:34:50,960
to grab a reference to the window itself

973
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:55,550
and then the dollar bracket there is

974
00:34:55,550 --> 00:34:56,690
basically doing the equivalent of a

975
00:34:56,690 --> 00:34:58,790
document dot get element by ID and then

976
00:34:58,790 --> 00:35:00,800
I can do window dot and then when let's

977
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,930
pull up the source code here to this so

978
00:35:02,930 --> 00:35:06,260
we're going to do view main and say we

979
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:09,530
want to change the this controls pitch

980
00:35:09,530 --> 00:35:20,339
we want to change that text so control

981
00:35:20,349 --> 00:35:22,490
so if you saw it was this duck controls

982
00:35:22,490 --> 00:35:23,390
that pitch so we're now we're doing

983
00:35:23,390 --> 00:35:40,040
windows duck controls pitch dot set

984
00:35:40,050 --> 00:35:43,270
so as you can see here i just called set

985
00:35:43,270 --> 00:35:45,790
text on that text element and then i go

986
00:35:45,790 --> 00:35:47,830
in and say hello jay is conf and you can

987
00:35:47,830 --> 00:35:49,000
see that it updated right here on the

988
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,740
screen in real time and showed you that

989
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:52,720
information so you can basically go in

990
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:54,280
and poke and prod and do anything inside

991
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:56,020
of your widget experience right here

992
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:57,640
through this terminal and what your

993
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:59,110
coding there so I could go in and create

994
00:35:59,110 --> 00:36:00,400
new buttons I could put them on the

995
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,350
screen I could you know control the

996
00:36:02,350 --> 00:36:04,120
whole interaction experience say for

997
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:08,350
example I wanted to simulate the user

998
00:36:08,350 --> 00:36:10,600
actually hitting the enter key I could

999
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:13,840
do that / key space enter and that would

1000
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:15,640
actually take me right to the LinkedIn

1001
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:18,370
authorization page an example here where

1002
00:36:18,370 --> 00:36:20,080
we were talking about with the back

1003
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:22,000
button so this is the back button you

1004
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,320
can see where it has a title which kind

1005
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:24,880
of gives it a window title and then the

1006
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,260
back button there allows the user to

1007
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:27,610
actually to go back just by hitting

1008
00:36:27,610 --> 00:36:30,940
Enter on that the settings view that I'd

1009
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:32,560
actually told you about and didn't show

1010
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:34,900
you yet so in this case here it's just

1011
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:37,810
in about box and if you notice in the

1012
00:36:37,810 --> 00:36:39,970
code that I wrote here we don't actually

1013
00:36:39,970 --> 00:36:41,800
have an about box view anywhere inside

1014
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:44,560
of these views so what we actually if we

1015
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:48,270
look at the widget sorry at the unit jas

1016
00:36:48,270 --> 00:36:50,860
you'll see that i'm actually using a

1017
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:52,900
view class of context I've used about

1018
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:55,570
box this is a system built in view

1019
00:36:55,570 --> 00:36:57,280
there's a several of them that you can

1020
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,810
actually go in and Stan she ate and it

1021
00:36:58,810 --> 00:36:59,920
just makes it quick and easy for you to

1022
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:00,910
be able to throw something up there on

1023
00:37:00,910 --> 00:37:02,170
the screen that's relevant to the users

1024
00:37:02,170 --> 00:37:03,430
or in this case that would be the

1025
00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:05,740
LinkedIn or in this case the about view

1026
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:07,270
and shows you more information about

1027
00:37:07,270 --> 00:37:20,570
that all right

1028
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:23,280
so what does all the things I promise

1029
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:24,390
you know it can't kind of give you a

1030
00:37:24,390 --> 00:37:25,950
quick brief overview there of developing

1031
00:37:25,950 --> 00:37:26,850
widget what are some of the things that

1032
00:37:26,850 --> 00:37:29,010
you can do in a widget so number one is

1033
00:37:29,010 --> 00:37:31,470
there's plenty of content based services

1034
00:37:31,470 --> 00:37:32,910
that you can do you can do news you can

1035
00:37:32,910 --> 00:37:33,960
do social media there's already a

1036
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:34,950
facebook there's already a Twitter

1037
00:37:34,950 --> 00:37:37,380
widget out there basically anybody that

1038
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:38,910
works for any other social networks out

1039
00:37:38,910 --> 00:37:40,260
there you can quickly develop a widget

1040
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:42,600
and have it running on the TV obviously

1041
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:44,460
there's media so whether it's video

1042
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:46,710
streaming there's already a YouTube

1043
00:37:46,710 --> 00:37:48,030
widget that allows you to be able to

1044
00:37:48,030 --> 00:37:50,580
watch youtube videos there is a yahoo

1045
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:51,930
video widget that I developed that

1046
00:37:51,930 --> 00:37:52,890
allows you to be able to watch jaju

1047
00:37:52,890 --> 00:37:55,290
videos that are hosted on yahoo there's

1048
00:37:55,290 --> 00:37:56,490
plenty of other things you could do

1049
00:37:56,490 --> 00:37:58,230
there be very easy to go in and develop

1050
00:37:58,230 --> 00:38:00,240
a Vimeo widget and additional widget

1051
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:02,100
content of different types there's a

1052
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:03,330
showtime widget that allows you to be

1053
00:38:03,330 --> 00:38:04,400
able to watch showtime shows

1054
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,810
theoretically speaking if hulu had an

1055
00:38:06,810 --> 00:38:08,910
h.264 stream they could actually you

1056
00:38:08,910 --> 00:38:10,530
could go in and watch hulu videos right

1057
00:38:10,530 --> 00:38:12,720
there on your television there is an

1058
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:14,850
amazon unbox widget which allows you to

1059
00:38:14,850 --> 00:38:16,740
be able watch the amazon videos on

1060
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:19,080
demand stuff there is a blockbuster

1061
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:20,310
widget that actually allows you be able

1062
00:38:20,310 --> 00:38:21,840
to watch any of the blockbuster instant

1063
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:24,690
streaming videos there is a number of

1064
00:38:24,690 --> 00:38:26,160
different photo applications from picasa

1065
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:28,680
to flickr to all the different types of

1066
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:30,450
videos mean photo sharing services that

1067
00:38:30,450 --> 00:38:32,280
you can actually use as a widget music

1068
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:33,540
right now there's already a pandora

1069
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:38,040
widget there is a let's see there's a

1070
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:39,180
pandora widget there's a couple

1071
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:41,370
different radio like streaming internet

1072
00:38:41,370 --> 00:38:44,250
radio providers there's also as another

1073
00:38:44,250 --> 00:38:46,320
example of a stream kind of a media

1074
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:51,120
streaming there is the just a whole

1075
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,140
bunch of different ones on the platform

1076
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:53,340
that you can actually go and you can

1077
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:55,830
develop a whole bunch more gaming so

1078
00:38:55,830 --> 00:38:56,970
right now there's a whole bunch of

1079
00:38:56,970 --> 00:38:58,830
different kind of basic games like card

1080
00:38:58,830 --> 00:39:00,990
games and you know bejeweled and kind of

1081
00:39:00,990 --> 00:39:02,340
things along those lines that are

1082
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:03,780
currently available to platform you

1083
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:05,880
could easily go in and develop a lot of

1084
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:07,820
different types of gameplay interactions

1085
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:10,050
one of the examples that I was going to

1086
00:39:10,050 --> 00:39:12,030
do if I had a TV here was actually going

1087
00:39:12,030 --> 00:39:13,590
in and showing you where you could have

1088
00:39:13,590 --> 00:39:15,900
a palm pre sitting in your hand I'm

1089
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:17,760
running with nodejs and then be able to

1090
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:20,040
have the TV connect to that and then use

1091
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:21,480
the controls to be able to do a race

1092
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:24,300
card game so that's of course possible

1093
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:25,500
there and you can do multiplayer and

1094
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:27,180
things along those lines TV

1095
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:28,620
interactivity is something that just

1096
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:32,220
recently came out the TVs are not in the

1097
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:33,750
field that support this yet but they

1098
00:39:33,750 --> 00:39:33,940
were

1099
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:35,950
announced at CES and allows you to be

1100
00:39:35,950 --> 00:39:38,410
able so which it can detect what TV show

1101
00:39:38,410 --> 00:39:40,270
you're currently watching and provide

1102
00:39:40,270 --> 00:39:41,740
relevant information so maybe you wanted

1103
00:39:41,740 --> 00:39:43,510
to show IMDb information for the movie

1104
00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:45,329
that they're watching or maybe you are

1105
00:39:45,329 --> 00:39:47,470
Lincoln and you wanted to be able to

1106
00:39:47,470 --> 00:39:49,089
show every time there's a commercial you

1107
00:39:49,089 --> 00:39:50,470
wanted to be able to give the user the

1108
00:39:50,470 --> 00:39:52,119
option to be able to see more

1109
00:39:52,119 --> 00:39:53,500
information about LinkedIn and kind of

1110
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:55,510
go into a full screen experience those

1111
00:39:55,510 --> 00:39:56,910
are things that you could do also

1112
00:39:56,910 --> 00:39:59,440
widgets could be developed easily for

1113
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:01,599
things like you know american idol so

1114
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:02,710
you want to be able to do the voting you

1115
00:40:02,710 --> 00:40:03,579
could vote right there from your

1116
00:40:03,579 --> 00:40:05,290
television screen and not have to call

1117
00:40:05,290 --> 00:40:07,420
in or do anything additional and then

1118
00:40:07,420 --> 00:40:08,440
one of the things that I've actually

1119
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:11,170
used the connected TV platform the most

1120
00:40:11,170 --> 00:40:13,089
personally is kind of like stuff that

1121
00:40:13,089 --> 00:40:15,700
isn't exactly intended uses for it like

1122
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:17,829
I went in and built a widget that shows

1123
00:40:17,829 --> 00:40:19,900
the bill box status so a TVs up on

1124
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:21,369
screen and you can go in and see like

1125
00:40:21,369 --> 00:40:22,599
what the current status is of all the

1126
00:40:22,599 --> 00:40:24,460
different Hudson build projects and be

1127
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:25,420
able to see that information on the

1128
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:27,970
screen I've also done some mr TG graphs

1129
00:40:27,970 --> 00:40:30,339
and have them show up on the screen it

1130
00:40:30,339 --> 00:40:32,140
would be very easy to do a like a booth

1131
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:34,569
kiosk and one of the awesome things is

1132
00:40:34,569 --> 00:40:36,369
is because this is an open platform you

1133
00:40:36,369 --> 00:40:37,720
can develop anything and not have to

1134
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:39,040
actually publish it to the world you can

1135
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:40,480
install it and run it right on your TV

1136
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:43,060
immediately just by putting it up into

1137
00:40:43,060 --> 00:40:44,079
the gallery and signing up for a free

1138
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:46,119
developer account so one of the things

1139
00:40:46,119 --> 00:40:47,140
that you can do that with that that's

1140
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:49,690
really cool is that I went in and built

1141
00:40:49,690 --> 00:40:51,730
a home entertainment kind of a widget

1142
00:40:51,730 --> 00:40:53,230
that allows me to be able to browse all

1143
00:40:53,230 --> 00:40:54,910
the different content that I have hosted

1144
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:57,640
on my mac mini some of that just

1145
00:40:57,640 --> 00:40:59,380
standard h.264 stream some that audio

1146
00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:00,760
some that you know pictures stuff like

1147
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:02,589
this and I can go in and be able to

1148
00:41:02,589 --> 00:41:03,940
search through you know all of my DVDs

1149
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:07,060
that I ripped in h.264 streams and have

1150
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:08,740
that all running off of my mac mini and

1151
00:41:08,740 --> 00:41:10,030
then be able to see that on my widget

1152
00:41:10,030 --> 00:41:11,319
and be able to search for the movies and

1153
00:41:11,319 --> 00:41:12,700
be able to play them instantly that's

1154
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:13,930
something that any of you could hear the

1155
00:41:13,930 --> 00:41:15,280
audience could do and it would take you

1156
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:16,390
I mean I could give you the source code

1157
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:17,950
of the one that I wrote or you could

1158
00:41:17,950 --> 00:41:19,750
actually build yourself literally in a

1159
00:41:19,750 --> 00:41:21,640
couple hours and be able to show all of

1160
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:23,109
your content and install it on the TV

1161
00:41:23,109 --> 00:41:25,450
and most of you if you bought a TV since

1162
00:41:25,450 --> 00:41:27,730
2009 and you spit more than about 700

1163
00:41:27,730 --> 00:41:29,079
bucks for it or you bought it one in the

1164
00:41:29,079 --> 00:41:30,880
last year and spent more than 300 others

1165
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,890
for it you probably already have the

1166
00:41:32,890 --> 00:41:34,599
connected TV stuff on there you just

1167
00:41:34,599 --> 00:41:35,950
didn't realize it because it's not well

1168
00:41:35,950 --> 00:41:37,359
communicated on the boxes and things

1169
00:41:37,359 --> 00:41:41,680
like this so I also did kind of an like

1170
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:43,270
a little sample here of some different

1171
00:41:43,270 --> 00:41:45,069
experiences so you could be able to see

1172
00:41:45,069 --> 00:41:46,839
the different widgets so up here in the

1173
00:41:46,839 --> 00:41:47,650
upper left-hand corner

1174
00:41:47,650 --> 00:41:49,570
you can see the widget gallery which

1175
00:41:49,570 --> 00:41:51,160
allows you to go in and install widgets

1176
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:52,570
in this case right here it's actually

1177
00:41:52,570 --> 00:41:53,980
showing the new widget gallery that's

1178
00:41:53,980 --> 00:41:55,480
getting ready to launch that allows you

1179
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:56,620
to be able to purchase in by

1180
00:41:56,620 --> 00:41:58,900
applications the one in the top middle

1181
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:01,570
is a flickr slideshow which shows kind

1182
00:42:01,570 --> 00:42:03,250
of an example of having images in the

1183
00:42:03,250 --> 00:42:05,890
sidebar the third one as we saw was like

1184
00:42:05,890 --> 00:42:07,780
having a TV picture and then having the

1185
00:42:07,780 --> 00:42:10,690
doc across the bottom the fourth one

1186
00:42:10,690 --> 00:42:12,220
which is in the bottom left hand side is

1187
00:42:12,220 --> 00:42:13,720
actually kind of an interesting one so

1188
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:14,560
say you're watching The Home Shopping

1189
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:16,600
Network I don't know why anybody in this

1190
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:18,040
audience would be but if you're watching

1191
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:19,450
The Home Shopping Network and you wanted

1192
00:42:19,450 --> 00:42:20,320
to go in and purchase something

1193
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:22,420
immediately well you can actually have a

1194
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:23,620
Home Shopping Network widget that

1195
00:42:23,620 --> 00:42:24,700
actually knows what you're currently

1196
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:26,740
seeing on TV and then has a buy now

1197
00:42:26,740 --> 00:42:28,030
button and allows you to purchase it

1198
00:42:28,030 --> 00:42:30,340
immediately right there and then a fifth

1199
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:31,810
one is an example this is from the

1200
00:42:31,810 --> 00:42:33,250
Flickr widget but it's actually using a

1201
00:42:33,250 --> 00:42:34,420
standard control that's available in the

1202
00:42:34,420 --> 00:42:35,650
framework that allows you to be able to

1203
00:42:35,650 --> 00:42:37,780
do kind of a slideshow and then with a

1204
00:42:37,780 --> 00:42:39,070
kind of a film strip across the bottom

1205
00:42:39,070 --> 00:42:40,780
so users can jump ahead in the slideshow

1206
00:42:40,780 --> 00:42:44,440
and be able to see additional things so

1207
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:46,480
kind of wrapping up here for more

1208
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:48,160
information obviously one of the best

1209
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:49,930
sources for the connected TV platform is

1210
00:42:49,930 --> 00:42:52,450
go to connect to TV yahoo com there you

1211
00:42:52,450 --> 00:42:53,950
can see tons of developer information

1212
00:42:53,950 --> 00:42:55,390
you can see a whole bunch of videos

1213
00:42:55,390 --> 00:42:56,620
about how to do different things on the

1214
00:42:56,620 --> 00:42:58,810
platform I apologize it's my face my

1215
00:42:58,810 --> 00:43:01,780
video that's up there on all those and

1216
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:03,610
so you'll have to endure my voice a

1217
00:43:03,610 --> 00:43:04,540
little bit longer if you want to watch

1218
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:07,120
those there's tons of documentation tons

1219
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:09,850
of sample code then obviously if you're

1220
00:43:09,850 --> 00:43:11,110
interested in getting involved on the

1221
00:43:11,110 --> 00:43:13,360
LinkedIn developer API s go to developer

1222
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:14,920
to linkedin com and there's a tons of

1223
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:15,880
different things that you can do with

1224
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:17,470
that happy to talk to anybody and

1225
00:43:17,470 --> 00:43:18,580
throughout the conference about either

1226
00:43:18,580 --> 00:43:20,860
one of those two and then some more

1227
00:43:20,860 --> 00:43:22,780
information about myself obviously you

1228
00:43:22,780 --> 00:43:23,920
can find me at my website Jeremy

1229
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:26,560
Johnstone com I have a crapload of stuff

1230
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:28,060
that's up on github so you can find me

1231
00:43:28,060 --> 00:43:30,670
there or via Twitter via the Twitter

1232
00:43:30,670 --> 00:43:32,830
user ID which if any of you were in here

1233
00:43:32,830 --> 00:43:34,450
earlier this morning you probably know

1234
00:43:34,450 --> 00:43:36,010
my twitter ID already because apparently

1235
00:43:36,010 --> 00:43:37,360
i was the biggest band with upstream

1236
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:41,770
consumer this morning so any questions

1237
00:43:41,770 --> 00:43:48,620
we have time we don't
