00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:09,090

hi-yah my name is Francisco Tomas key

2
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:12,610
and I'm not gonna be talking about

3
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:16,000
transpiling yes if that's in the

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,529
schedule the speaker says the real name

5
00:00:17,529 --> 00:00:19,119
of my talk which is the browsers and

6
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:21,369
feature complete but surprise I'm not

7
00:00:21,369 --> 00:00:21,970
talking about that either

8
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:24,820
I actually didn't change my talk for

9
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:26,230
like a third time I just came up with a

10
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:29,080
better name like at the time I thought

11
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:30,310
of this name was just kind of a jumble

12
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:31,570
of ideas as was the best thing I could

13
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:33,670
come up with but this is what I actually

14
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:36,339
want to talk about and it is the

15
00:00:36,339 --> 00:00:38,489
Internet as an incremental skill and

16
00:00:38,489 --> 00:00:42,820
it's kind of about like my journey in

17
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:44,620
becoming a programmer through the web

18
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:49,210
and the original inspiration for this

19
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:51,870
came from another talk by David Nolan

20
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:54,219
and it's to talk about closure script

21
00:00:54,219 --> 00:00:56,500
actually he gave it a Texas je s but at

22
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:58,449
the beginning of his talk he focused a

23
00:00:58,449 --> 00:01:00,160
lot on the importance of consoles and

24
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,079
how that was super important in him

25
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:04,210
becoming a programmer specifically I

26
00:01:04,210 --> 00:01:05,560
think his first computer was like an

27
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:07,539
Apple 2 or something and that thing

28
00:01:07,539 --> 00:01:09,610
fundamentally worked like a console in

29
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:12,399
that like the way you interacted with it

30
00:01:12,399 --> 00:01:14,440
was basically programming and how he

31
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:17,020
feels that consoles are important today

32
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:19,479
still and I agree with that because even

33
00:01:19,479 --> 00:01:21,310
though my first computer was not an

34
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:24,369
Apple 2 I also kind of started with

35
00:01:24,369 --> 00:01:26,709
computers with a console only my console

36
00:01:26,709 --> 00:01:29,349
looked like this but that's a lie right

37
00:01:29,349 --> 00:01:32,099
my console actually looked like this

38
00:01:32,099 --> 00:01:34,599
yeah my girlfriend actually like went

39
00:01:34,599 --> 00:01:37,270
and installed OS 9 and Netscape 7 just

40
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:39,880
to get that screen shot so there you go

41
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:41,619
and yeah back then there was no console

42
00:01:41,619 --> 00:01:42,910
right like literally everything had to

43
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:44,530
be like a stream of alerts and there was

44
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:46,810
no like disable any more alerts it was a

45
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:50,709
fun time to program but so I kind of

46
00:01:50,709 --> 00:01:52,209
want to take you back to this time which

47
00:01:52,209 --> 00:01:55,630
was you know around 1998-99 and give you

48
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:58,619
a sense of how I kind of developed my

49
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:02,560
programming skills through just kind of

50
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,619
using the web so at the time I was like

51
00:02:05,619 --> 00:02:07,209
a teenager and you know teenagers have

52
00:02:07,209 --> 00:02:10,569
things to say and one of the outlets to

53
00:02:10,569 --> 00:02:12,550
say stuff is live journal for me wasn't

54
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:13,960
actually live journal for me it was the

55
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:16,090
Mac addict forums because I was super

56
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:18,370
pissed that they made AI tools

57
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:19,930
like a pay service after they promised

58
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:23,049
this would be free for life so mag

59
00:02:23,049 --> 00:02:25,239
addict and then later on you know

60
00:02:25,239 --> 00:02:26,590
another way to express yourself was of

61
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:29,620
course myspace and the really

62
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:31,659
interesting thing about like these

63
00:02:31,659 --> 00:02:34,090
services these like I don't know what to

64
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:36,159
call them social slash talky services

65
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:39,519
was that at the time we hadn't really

66
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:42,280
made like really nice in browser editors

67
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:44,769
right like or like WYSIWYG like you know

68
00:02:44,769 --> 00:02:47,019
make things bold or whatever and either

69
00:02:47,019 --> 00:02:49,420
by design like in live journals case or

70
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:52,569
by accident in MySpace's case people

71
00:02:52,569 --> 00:02:55,599
started to figure out that you can make

72
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:58,120
your post more interesting if you use

73
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:01,810
kind of this magic text called HTML so

74
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:03,579
you know if you went and posted on lots

75
00:03:03,579 --> 00:03:05,470
of forums they weren't sanitizing HTML

76
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:06,849
yet so you could like kind of throw in

77
00:03:06,849 --> 00:03:08,530
some tags and like you know things would

78
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:10,569
start doing crazy stuff or in the case

79
00:03:10,569 --> 00:03:11,890
of like MySpace you could like change

80
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:15,909
the entire page right and this was

81
00:03:15,909 --> 00:03:18,190
really interesting in my opinion because

82
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:22,150
it's a kind of a cool approach to a

83
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:23,470
problem that I think is really hard

84
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:26,829
which is syntax I think if you're a

85
00:03:26,829 --> 00:03:29,889
programmer you kind of forget how hard

86
00:03:29,889 --> 00:03:32,919
the initial syntax steps are of like you

87
00:03:32,919 --> 00:03:35,379
really got to make that thing a hundred

88
00:03:35,379 --> 00:03:37,000
percent correct or the computer is just

89
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,150
gonna do nothing and this was very

90
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:42,250
different right because HTML is really

91
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:45,609
forgiving so when you went and you were

92
00:03:45,609 --> 00:03:47,739
kind of like just copy pasting random

93
00:03:47,739 --> 00:03:49,269
things from like either view source or

94
00:03:49,269 --> 00:03:50,859
your friend would say like hey if you

95
00:03:50,859 --> 00:03:52,840
paste this into like your MySpace it'll

96
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,280
turn your background into like some

97
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,560
crazy image you could kind of get away

98
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,209
with not getting it a hundred percent

99
00:03:58,209 --> 00:04:00,010
right and more importantly not fully

100
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:01,599
understanding even what you're doing

101
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:03,220
right someone pasted you something you

102
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:04,480
put it in it's kind of like a little

103
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,730
piece of magic that you put into this

104
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:09,669
existing site and also like HTML was a

105
00:04:09,669 --> 00:04:11,139
lot easier to back then right like I

106
00:04:11,139 --> 00:04:13,180
think this really speaks to a lot of

107
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:14,470
people who are programmers right like a

108
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:16,090
lot of people know what fonts are so if

109
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:18,160
I say font color equals red like they

110
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,660
kind of get the sense that that'll make

111
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:21,099
it read and there even need to close the

112
00:04:21,099 --> 00:04:22,510
tag and if you wanted to be black later

113
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:23,860
you just open a new tag and just keep

114
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:27,760
opening tags and whatever right and the

115
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,020
coolest part about this was that like

116
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:30,039
that that's not the end of like the

117
00:04:30,039 --> 00:04:31,300
journey right like that's

118
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:32,289
point someone figured out that there's

119
00:04:32,289 --> 00:04:35,500
even more magical tags you can kind of

120
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,240
add this onclick thing and then it might

121
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:41,069
actually do some dynamic things right so

122
00:04:41,069 --> 00:04:44,080
going from kind of like just posting

123
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,759
nonsense on the web to like posting

124
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:49,030
nonsense that like does crazy stuff was

125
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:50,259
kind of like this really easy

126
00:04:50,259 --> 00:04:54,159
incremental step and if you don't wanted

127
00:04:54,159 --> 00:04:55,629
to take kind of the next step and like

128
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:57,460
you know just having a live journal or

129
00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:00,129
whatever wasn't enough that was also

130
00:05:00,129 --> 00:05:01,270
kind of easy right because there were

131
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:02,860
like these services like geo cities or

132
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:04,389
if you like went to college like you

133
00:05:04,389 --> 00:05:06,729
know they gave you a free like place to

134
00:05:06,729 --> 00:05:09,219
host your site or you know it I don't

135
00:05:09,219 --> 00:05:10,780
know if this is true anymore but like at

136
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:13,150
least at this time every ISP kind of

137
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:15,039
also gave you like a free website or

138
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:17,050
whatever like bars was adelphia but like

139
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:18,639
you know people had their AOL pages or

140
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:22,810
whatever and so going from kind of just

141
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:26,229
learning to throw HTML at like existing

142
00:05:26,229 --> 00:05:29,469
websites to making your own website was

143
00:05:29,469 --> 00:05:31,150
also kind of easy especially because

144
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:32,860
again HTML is really forgiving and kind

145
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:34,870
of like any strings more or less valid

146
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:37,779
HTML so you could like grab like the

147
00:05:37,779 --> 00:05:39,310
HTML right from a post and put it in

148
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:41,050
like a document and that would be kind

149
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:43,360
of the start of a webpage and you didn't

150
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,469
really need to understand anything about

151
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:45,940
servers or anything like I remember when

152
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:48,550
I was doing this like the way it worked

153
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:49,840
was it was just like literally like a

154
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,310
file upload button and you would upload

155
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:54,009
your HTML files and that's actually how

156
00:05:54,009 --> 00:05:56,199
I learned about zip files like I came

157
00:05:56,199 --> 00:05:58,029
from a map world and it was all stuff

158
00:05:58,029 --> 00:06:00,069
that expander and like I was like why

159
00:06:00,069 --> 00:06:01,419
can't I upload folders this is

160
00:06:01,419 --> 00:06:03,099
ridiculous technology and so I was like

161
00:06:03,099 --> 00:06:09,159
no zips man oh ok so this process was

162
00:06:09,159 --> 00:06:11,199
like really natural and a lot of my

163
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:14,199
friends had websites a lot more than I

164
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:16,900
think would today actually and in fact

165
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:18,729
even my dad who doesn't do anything

166
00:06:18,729 --> 00:06:20,259
technology at all he's a microbiologist

167
00:06:20,259 --> 00:06:22,779
I also had a website and again his

168
00:06:22,779 --> 00:06:24,819
understanding was this kind of gray area

169
00:06:24,819 --> 00:06:26,800
of like you know I've stolen different

170
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,210
parts from different sites and kind of

171
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:30,009
put this thing together this would be

172
00:06:30,009 --> 00:06:31,690
like before the age of minification so

173
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:33,550
that still kind of worked right that was

174
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:36,159
still like feasible and then the best

175
00:06:36,159 --> 00:06:38,889
part of all right is that once you had

176
00:06:38,889 --> 00:06:40,899
this thing on a server a lot of servers

177
00:06:40,899 --> 00:06:44,139
already had like PHP installed so are

178
00:06:44,139 --> 00:06:44,920
this

179
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,990
this other even more magical tag that

180
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:49,450
did kind of more stuff so this

181
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:51,100
transition was like really natural right

182
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:52,360
like the font tag which I totally

183
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,650
understand right like oh I can set a

184
00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:56,050
color to like unclick which like kind of

185
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:57,520
speaks to me Oh what is it gonna do well

186
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,590
on click it'll do something to like this

187
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:02,350
kind of crazy tag that like will do

188
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:04,480
survery stuff and that's definitely the

189
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:07,540
way I felt about those things like oh I

190
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:09,430
didn't like really fully understand what

191
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:12,280
was going on with a PHP but like I could

192
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:16,000
copy/paste enough to get by and so this

193
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,210
is kind of what I call this incremental

194
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:22,210
skill where like going from doing easy

195
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:24,550
stuff to hard stuff is kind of like a

196
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:28,600
spectrum and there's kind of a lot of

197
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,460
really interesting properties about each

198
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:33,280
step in the spectrum you know each step

199
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,780
kind of builds from the last right in

200
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:37,570
each step kind of like is perhaps a

201
00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:39,160
little harder than it needs to be again

202
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:43,330
like posting in like livejournal with

203
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:45,580
like HTML tags is definitely harder than

204
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:48,340
using like a really nice web editor but

205
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:50,560
that little bit of learning kind of pays

206
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,820
dividends later because it puts your

207
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:54,430
foot into like the next step and not

208
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:57,880
only that but each step is also like its

209
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,980
own conclusion if you want right like if

210
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:02,010
you stop in the middle it's fine like

211
00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:04,900
you haven't wasted any time like any one

212
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:07,180
of these steps if that's like the end of

213
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:08,950
your journey you still have like a lot

214
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:13,180
of really useful I guess skills to do

215
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:14,590
exactly those things that you tried to

216
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:17,920
do so basically each step kind of like

217
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:20,860
adds immediate value now so another way

218
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:22,150
to think about it is kind of like you

219
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:23,650
know going from reading the web to

220
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:24,940
writing the web is kind of this natural

221
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:28,570
transition and then another way to look

222
00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:30,070
at it it's kind of like you start up as

223
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:32,320
a user and then you kind of abuse the

224
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,790
web right like a you find ways to like

225
00:08:33,790 --> 00:08:35,410
change things in your sites and

226
00:08:35,410 --> 00:08:37,690
eventually you create with the web and

227
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:39,010
then perhaps a more politically correct

228
00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:40,660
ways to say you're kind of like a pro

229
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:43,390
user and once I kind of started thinking

230
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:46,660
about that process of learning to

231
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:48,760
program that I went through I kind of

232
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:52,030
saw it in a lot of other things and the

233
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:54,070
other big one I saw it in was Ti

234
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:55,540
calculators which was kind of the other

235
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:57,770
big way I learned how to program

236
00:08:57,770 --> 00:09:00,110
and you know math class at some point

237
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:02,570
you know you got to shell out a hundred

238
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:06,320
bucks and buy this thing and the really

239
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,500
cool thing about the ti calculators is

240
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,480
that it kind of has this different

241
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:14,270
accidental super-successful approach to

242
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:17,510
syntax which is that every line that you

243
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:19,400
type into the calculator to get a result

244
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,740
is actually a valid line of Basic and

245
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:22,970
you don't even know that when you're

246
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:26,900
using it and so even if you're not

247
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:29,210
programming you're starting to get a

248
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:32,090
handle for what the computer wants right

249
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:33,890
like if you just have one line of code

250
00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:36,950
or one line of I don't know math and you

251
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:38,300
forget a parenthesis or something and

252
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:41,030
you get an error you start to build this

253
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:42,620
intuition for like oh I really do need

254
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:44,240
to always close my parentheses right and

255
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:47,360
it's really easy to deal with the error

256
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,950
when it's just one line as opposed to

257
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:50,360
like if you're just learning programming

258
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,860
you've got ten lines it's like error and

259
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:52,850
you're like oh I don't know right like

260
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:54,800
here you type one line it says uh uh

261
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:58,580
then you go back okay I see and the

262
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:02,150
tricks you learn in like building the or

263
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:04,550
like using the calculator again kind of

264
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:07,610
help you secretly become kind of a

265
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:09,380
programmer right like one of the first

266
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:11,390
steps in like becoming a better ti-83

267
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:14,570
user is that hey you know the first time

268
00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:15,770
you get like a problem wrong because

269
00:10:15,770 --> 00:10:17,720
like you duplicated the same thing twice

270
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,250
right in that second line instead of

271
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:21,020
storing it to a variable then it's

272
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:22,250
eventually someone's like no no no just

273
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:24,290
store it and then like then you can use

274
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:25,880
it later and you've just kind of

275
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:28,750
accidentally learned variables right and

276
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:30,740
then something happens where you

277
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:33,200
discover that TI programs can have our

278
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,760
sorry Ti calculators can have programs

279
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,320
either that's because your teachers like

280
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,180
hey download this math program or more

281
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:41,350
likely because you downloaded Tetris but

282
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:43,640
ii like the spark goes off in your mind

283
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:47,050
that TI e calculators have programs

284
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:49,850
there's always some crafty student in

285
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:51,770
the class who figures out that ok fine

286
00:10:51,770 --> 00:10:54,440
programs but you know what programs are

287
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,610
just kind of this place we can write

288
00:10:55,610 --> 00:10:56,810
text so i don't know what a program

289
00:10:56,810 --> 00:10:58,190
necessarily does but i know it can use

290
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:01,310
it to cheat right and the crazy thing

291
00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:03,950
about this is that this is almost a

292
00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:05,870
functioning program right like what

293
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:08,560
you've done is just typed in a formula

294
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:11,630
but the step from going like

295
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:14,810
hey I can use my calculator to cheat -

296
00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:18,709
hey the calculator can cheat for me is

297
00:11:18,709 --> 00:11:22,519
not that big of a step right so I think

298
00:11:22,519 --> 00:11:24,290
this look definitely follows this kind

299
00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:25,910
of like same spectrum right like there's

300
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:28,069
this definite like abuse section in the

301
00:11:28,069 --> 00:11:29,360
middle and then you start off just using

302
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,000
it and then by the end you've kind of

303
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,940
accidentally learned how to program not

304
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:36,500
because you set out to be a programmer

305
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:40,160
but because at every single step you

306
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,529
were offered a little bit of value if

307
00:11:42,529 --> 00:11:45,709
you just put in a little bit of work and

308
00:11:45,709 --> 00:11:47,449
that and I kind of want to compare that

309
00:11:47,449 --> 00:11:49,279
to like you know if you say I'm gonna

310
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:50,810
become a programmer and then like if you

311
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:52,550
stop after like class - but like an

312
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:54,709
online class you know how to draw a

313
00:11:54,709 --> 00:11:56,269
bunch of circles or something as opposed

314
00:11:56,269 --> 00:11:57,709
to like no I have I have like if you

315
00:11:57,709 --> 00:11:59,480
stop at the tetris stage then you know

316
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:00,620
how to use the calculator you know how

317
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:02,000
to store variables and you know how to

318
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,889
play Tetris as opposed to like having

319
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:05,329
this weird random I know how to draw

320
00:12:05,329 --> 00:12:11,420
circles in this one API like skill so

321
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:13,310
user Pro user and creator and kind of

322
00:12:13,310 --> 00:12:14,870
what I want to get across is that that

323
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:16,939
middle section I think is super

324
00:12:16,939 --> 00:12:19,310
important this kind of like making

325
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:21,230
people pro users before they become

326
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:24,170
creators sure lots people have heard of

327
00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:26,180
hyper card this is a system that was

328
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:29,959
designed I think very much with this

329
00:12:29,959 --> 00:12:33,170
kind of incremental step in mind you

330
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:34,970
start off using hyper card it's kind of

331
00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:37,040
just like a note-taking program and then

332
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,199
very slowly you can add features like oh

333
00:12:39,199 --> 00:12:40,880
I have lots of cards I can add some

334
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,740
navigation stuff and kind of

335
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:45,079
incrementally end up with like a fully

336
00:12:45,079 --> 00:12:47,630
functioning program and then obviously I

337
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:49,490
think reading and writing is the best

338
00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:50,870
example of this kind of incremental

339
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:53,149
thing where it's really hard to learn

340
00:12:53,149 --> 00:12:54,800
how to read without also learning how to

341
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,500
write right you know just you learn the

342
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:00,680
letters you learn how to read and you

343
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,000
can probably throw together a sign that

344
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,769
says like sale coffee or something even

345
00:13:03,769 --> 00:13:05,089
if it's kind of misspelled again in the

346
00:13:05,089 --> 00:13:07,250
same way that even like if you use the

347
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:08,600
wrong HTML tags or you don't do

348
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,009
everything a hundred percent correct you

349
00:13:10,009 --> 00:13:11,660
can still start getting value out of it

350
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:15,170
really early so I want to compare this

351
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:18,350
kind of like I don't know strategy of

352
00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:20,000
learning or method of learning to

353
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,920
something else which I call the like

354
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,740
appliance style of learning and I want

355
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:25,610
to like stress

356
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:27,650
right at the beginning that obviously

357
00:13:27,650 --> 00:13:30,650
I'm talking about incremental skills

358
00:13:30,650 --> 00:13:31,940
that's where my bias is going to show

359
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:33,890
but I don't want you to consider these

360
00:13:33,890 --> 00:13:36,140
as like good versus bad I think each has

361
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:37,250
its value

362
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:39,590
I just want to compare them and contrast

363
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:41,960
them so if this is like incremental

364
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:45,080
skill this is what appliance looks like

365
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:47,720
to me and basically it's not a spectrum

366
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:51,110
there's like huge gaps that require like

367
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:53,360
lots of activation energy either like

368
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,250
you know personally actually really

369
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:56,930
wanting to do something or you know

370
00:13:56,930 --> 00:13:58,820
might be just expensive to take the next

371
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:00,560
step or whatever and I think like a good

372
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:03,860
example of this is a microwave nothing

373
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:05,870
you really learn from a microwave kind

374
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:07,700
of sets you on the path to being a cook

375
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:10,490
right like learning the buttons does not

376
00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:11,930
prepare you for anything like learning

377
00:14:11,930 --> 00:14:13,160
that you shouldn't put metal in there

378
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:15,700
doesn't really have like overriding

379
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:17,840
implications at least I don't think so I

380
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:21,410
hope not so if we think of like cooking

381
00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:24,580
is kind of this appliance model you know

382
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:27,350
somewhere between you know my mom makes

383
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:29,360
me food and like I'm cooking a

384
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,130
five-course meal the microwave is

385
00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:32,510
somewhere in the middle but it's not

386
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:34,370
very smoothly in the middle you know

387
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:35,570
using postmates sit somewhere in the

388
00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:37,100
middle to but if you want to take the

389
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:38,420
next step to actually cook you're

390
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:39,920
probably gonna have to buy a whole bunch

391
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,450
of new tools and learn a whole bunch of

392
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:42,590
unrelated things right

393
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:45,530
and so I just want to quickly give you

394
00:14:45,530 --> 00:14:51,320
my nightmare scenario which is what

395
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,640
programming may look like in the future

396
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:55,120
which is you know you're given an iPad

397
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:59,110
congratulations you know daddy's rich

398
00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:01,100
you have things to say so you download

399
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:03,620
the medium app and you start you know

400
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:06,140
saying whatever and then I don't know by

401
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:07,340
some miracle I guess you become

402
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:08,810
interested in programming and then you

403
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:10,940
shell out another $2,000 for a different

404
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:12,440
kind of computer that requires all sorts

405
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,760
of different like learning curves and

406
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,920
then you pay under $99 to get like a

407
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,780
developer account and then your

408
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:21,800
programming I guess so I think that in

409
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:24,440
the iOS world programming feels a lot

410
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,450
more like an appliance where like the

411
00:15:26,450 --> 00:15:28,820
the things you download and use don't

412
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:31,600
really fit in a kind of bigger learning

413
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,600
spectrum they have like a very very

414
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,860
focused goal and then if you want to

415
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:39,110
program it's very divided like you

416
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:42,279
have to have that like kind of personal

417
00:15:42,279 --> 00:15:44,360
initiation to like say I want to do this

418
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:47,120
and like start learning it and I don't

419
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,430
want to really want to like this isn't

420
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:51,079
like an iOS versus the web thing because

421
00:15:51,079 --> 00:15:52,640
kind of the point of my talk is that I

422
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:53,930
feel that a very similar thing is

423
00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:56,269
happening to the web today and not for

424
00:15:56,269 --> 00:15:58,160
bad reasons like everything is happening

425
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,140
for kind of a good reason in

426
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:01,610
particularly like you know again I was

427
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:05,240
saying like when I was started

428
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:06,800
programming like live journals like kind

429
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,450
of the way you did things and now I

430
00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:10,190
think what's happened is we've made the

431
00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:12,860
easy stuff way easier right like medium

432
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:14,930
comm is way easier to use in like oh you

433
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:16,399
have to learn kind of HTML or something

434
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:18,680
I think no one can deny that you know

435
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:21,440
WYSIWYG editors are better for just like

436
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,940
writing long-form text like you

437
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:24,529
shouldn't have to learn HTML to write

438
00:16:24,529 --> 00:16:26,720
long-form text right and then the other

439
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,730
thing that's happened is all those

440
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:30,230
things is that I've kind of described

441
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:32,510
his benefits of like early HTML we're

442
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:34,070
also kind of hindrances right like we

443
00:16:34,070 --> 00:16:36,019
really cleaned HTML up and we made it a

444
00:16:36,019 --> 00:16:37,279
lot better we made the technologies much

445
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:38,870
more powerful so we've made the hard

446
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:44,990
stuff way harder and like you know my

447
00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:46,519
dad could figure out like font color

448
00:16:46,519 --> 00:16:48,110
equals red but I don't think he really

449
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:49,790
knows what a span is like what's a span

450
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:51,980
and like span style equals color : right

451
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:53,529
like all that stuff is way harder right

452
00:16:53,529 --> 00:16:55,970
and like definitely setting up like a

453
00:16:55,970 --> 00:16:57,680
node.js server is way harder than PHP

454
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,540
and like if you want to take a coat of

455
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:00,829
met CAD amia class again you have to

456
00:17:00,829 --> 00:17:02,390
sign up you have to decide I am becoming

457
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:08,360
a programmer right so all this stuff is

458
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:11,449
good it's just that I feel that the web

459
00:17:11,449 --> 00:17:13,819
is becoming more like this appliance

460
00:17:13,819 --> 00:17:16,730
model where there's now this kind of big

461
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:19,640
gap and I don't think people are kind of

462
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:22,040
building these kind of in-between skills

463
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:24,110
where they may end up kind of

464
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:25,760
accidentally becoming a programmer like

465
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,970
I did and I think that's fine as long as

466
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:32,870
we fill in that gap right and the reason

467
00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:36,620
I originally named this talk you know

468
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:39,470
the browser is not feature complete is

469
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:43,220
that I really feel that the browser is

470
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:45,530
what can fill in this gap and so to kind

471
00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:46,610
of explain what I mean by that I just

472
00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:49,040
want to give you a really super concise

473
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:52,220
and narrowly focused history of the

474
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:52,610
browser

475
00:17:52,610 --> 00:17:55,100
again that's netscape seven and this was

476
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:57,830
kind of like peak browser feature this

477
00:17:57,830 --> 00:17:59,870
browser had an email client a news

478
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:02,120
client a mail client sorry like a

479
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:04,340
netscape male versus like normal email

480
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:07,519
an address book an IRC client and it had

481
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:08,929
ill and some messenger built in it had

482
00:18:08,929 --> 00:18:10,549
radio built in right it had all sorts of

483
00:18:10,549 --> 00:18:13,669
things and generally people decided this

484
00:18:13,669 --> 00:18:14,990
was a bad thing this was like was a

485
00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:17,269
super slow browser it was really clumsy

486
00:18:17,269 --> 00:18:19,519
it was it was pretty bad and so the

487
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:22,610
response to that was phoenix which was

488
00:18:22,610 --> 00:18:25,580
later renamed Firefox I think for legal

489
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:27,380
reasons or something but the response

490
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:29,269
was to say hey it's a browser it just

491
00:18:29,269 --> 00:18:31,220
meant to browse things not like I don't

492
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:32,870
know listen to radio and like talk on

493
00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:35,840
AOL and stuff let's make the content

494
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:40,340
shine let's focus on engine stuff versus

495
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:44,450
browser features so you know again we

496
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:47,720
made html5 and JavaScript we better we

497
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:49,309
added all sorts of really cool developer

498
00:18:49,309 --> 00:18:51,740
tools to again help the core of the

499
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:53,299
browsing experience as opposed to all

500
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:55,250
the surrounding stuff you know we had

501
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:56,990
things like chrome which did the multi

502
00:18:56,990 --> 00:18:58,580
process stuff and we started even

503
00:18:58,580 --> 00:18:59,899
considering all sorts of cool new

504
00:18:59,899 --> 00:19:02,019
technologies and I think this kind of

505
00:19:02,019 --> 00:19:05,450
set the pace of where like the way we

506
00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:07,639
think about the browser was headed for a

507
00:19:07,639 --> 00:19:09,679
long time up until today right you can

508
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:11,659
definitely see this with you know mobile

509
00:19:11,659 --> 00:19:12,830
safari this is what it looked like in

510
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:14,840
the original version and this is what it

511
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:16,130
looks like now and as you can see we've

512
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:18,409
kind of like get that browser out of

513
00:19:18,409 --> 00:19:20,029
there right like let's just have the

514
00:19:20,029 --> 00:19:21,799
content and that's even more true like

515
00:19:21,799 --> 00:19:24,169
in a rotating motor like there's no

516
00:19:24,169 --> 00:19:25,639
browser at all finally finally got rid

517
00:19:25,639 --> 00:19:27,110
of the browser right like we can finally

518
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:29,059
look at just the website and this is

519
00:19:29,059 --> 00:19:34,100
also true of desktop right and this is

520
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:35,149
really interesting when you start to

521
00:19:35,149 --> 00:19:36,380
think of the browser this way is this

522
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:38,720
like basically Minimum Viable browser

523
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:43,309
right it's particularly interesting

524
00:19:43,309 --> 00:19:45,110
because it adds kind of a new layer of

525
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:47,000
understanding to a discussion that was

526
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,860
like very prevalent the last time I

527
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:50,380
spoke at J's compeers ago which was

528
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:54,590
Native versus web if you kind of think

529
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:56,289
of the browser is not doing anything

530
00:19:56,289 --> 00:20:00,440
anything above like just delivering the

531
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:04,640
website correctly it makes this

532
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,290
kind of a really tough argument for the

533
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:09,050
website right like you end up with like

534
00:20:09,050 --> 00:20:10,880
these really abstract reasons for why

535
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,560
the web is better like it's open right

536
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,210
it's kept harping it's open it so it

537
00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:15,620
doesn't really mean anything to like a

538
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:18,040
user you also end up with kind of like

539
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:21,140
developer reasons like oh hey like you

540
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:23,660
know I can ship to every single platform

541
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:25,760
really easily it's you know that's not

542
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:28,480
it's such a great user reason either

543
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,920
where it's like the native arguments are

544
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,000
really obvious like it's way faster

545
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,580
right it looks like it looks like it

546
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:36,380
fits into the rest of your OS and not

547
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:37,550
only that but you can make a bunch of

548
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:39,980
money if you do it right like so what I

549
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:43,700
remember pretty clearly is that really

550
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:47,030
unfortunately the argument became open

551
00:20:47,030 --> 00:20:49,370
versus good which was always gonna be a

552
00:20:49,370 --> 00:20:53,030
losing argument and that sucks because

553
00:20:53,030 --> 00:20:54,710
that's never the reason I really like

554
00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:56,960
the web like I don't particularly care

555
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:00,110
about those abstract reasons let me tell

556
00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:01,280
you what I like the web and let me do

557
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,050
that through a series of native

558
00:21:03,050 --> 00:21:04,910
experiences I've had

559
00:21:04,910 --> 00:21:08,660
this is iPad right I'm looking for a

560
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:11,540
drawing app because I don't know the new

561
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:14,360
pencils coming out and this is what I

562
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:16,070
get so every time I want to look at a

563
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:17,900
different app I get this like horrible

564
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:20,030
mobile modal experience that have to

565
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:22,670
keep going back and forth in and if I

566
00:21:22,670 --> 00:21:27,620
just had like tabs so I could like open

567
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:29,390
them all up and then later if I want to

568
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:30,920
do a different search I don't lose these

569
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,570
and I can come back to them that would

570
00:21:32,570 --> 00:21:34,490
be pretty cool it's too bad we have to

571
00:21:34,490 --> 00:21:36,380
wait for this programmer to implement

572
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:38,570
them on their own and if you notice

573
00:21:38,570 --> 00:21:40,610
something else these are just like the

574
00:21:40,610 --> 00:21:42,290
worst search results possible right like

575
00:21:42,290 --> 00:21:44,270
none of like Adobe sketch isn't there I

576
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:45,710
couldn't possibly be interested in the

577
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:47,570
most popular drawing a bright no

578
00:21:47,570 --> 00:21:49,970
wouldn't it be cool if like the way an

579
00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:52,100
iPad app was fundamentally made was

580
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:55,310
semantic so that you could put two

581
00:21:55,310 --> 00:21:57,710
different kinds of apps together one

582
00:21:57,710 --> 00:21:59,540
could understand the other and the one

583
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:02,060
that focuses really well on search could

584
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:03,500
give you way better search results I

585
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:05,930
guess we just have to wait until Apple

586
00:22:05,930 --> 00:22:08,480
gets really good at search so to Spotify

587
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,280
and you know rocking out to Jurassic

588
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:12,130
world had that thing you know just

589
00:22:12,130 --> 00:22:14,840
non-stop for a while so I'm really

590
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:17,330
curious about the songs I was listening

591
00:22:17,330 --> 00:22:18,110
to before

592
00:22:18,110 --> 00:22:19,490
because again I just had everything on

593
00:22:19,490 --> 00:22:21,200
repeat so I'm not really sure we're like

594
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,059
the history is so step one is of course

595
00:22:23,059 --> 00:22:26,720
I go into the forum and I find like how

596
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,970
to look at the songs I listen to well

597
00:22:28,970 --> 00:22:33,679
you click on that uh triple equals

598
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:34,640
button or something

599
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,920
I think it's an homage to JavaScript and

600
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,990
then you click on history but joke's on

601
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:41,270
you it only goes back fifty items so

602
00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:42,410
since you've been listening to lost

603
00:22:42,410 --> 00:22:43,790
world this whole time you're never gonna

604
00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:46,250
know right wouldn't it be cool if there

605
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:49,160
was like a system history where I could

606
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:51,410
decide how long and how far back it goes

607
00:22:51,410 --> 00:22:54,290
that way it's not up to me somehow

608
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:55,970
making a feature request to please make

609
00:22:55,970 --> 00:22:57,230
it go from fifty to a hundred or

610
00:22:57,230 --> 00:22:59,200
something ridiculous right

611
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,160
here's another experience I'm on the

612
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:02,929
Apple Store or in the App Store sorry

613
00:23:02,929 --> 00:23:05,540
and I really want to share this app with

614
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:07,309
someone else give them a hint that maybe

615
00:23:07,309 --> 00:23:09,710
they should buy it for me I know not

616
00:23:09,710 --> 00:23:12,710
really sure how to do that it's well if

617
00:23:12,710 --> 00:23:14,240
you look hard enough you'll see that if

618
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,740
you click there there's a copy link

619
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:18,049
button or share on Twitter sure to

620
00:23:18,049 --> 00:23:18,980
Facebook I have no idea what

621
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:22,190
tell-a-friend does no idea but what if

622
00:23:22,190 --> 00:23:24,620
you could use your existing skills to

623
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:27,230
kind of copy something that you could

624
00:23:27,230 --> 00:23:28,940
send to someone so you don't have to

625
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:31,460
like always be finding the unique way to

626
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:33,710
share with every particular app right or

627
00:23:33,710 --> 00:23:35,929
here's another idea my grandma called me

628
00:23:35,929 --> 00:23:37,280
and she really wants to know how to get

629
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,980
to her albums in iPhoto I really really

630
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:42,020
wish I could just respond with hey just

631
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:43,400
click that okay so leave me alone

632
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,750
just if you click that it'll take you to

633
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:46,790
your albums or even better if there was

634
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:48,530
like some sort of like system

635
00:23:48,530 --> 00:23:50,630
intelligent find where my grandma could

636
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:52,580
just type in albums and even if it's a

637
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:55,429
UI item like it still would show up in

638
00:23:55,429 --> 00:23:57,169
the find that you wouldn't even have to

639
00:23:57,169 --> 00:24:00,380
call me right these are the reasons I

640
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:04,610
like the web write this stuff it's it's

641
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:09,049
not really like JavaScript right or HTML

642
00:24:09,049 --> 00:24:11,660
like those things are great but that's

643
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:13,220
not really what makes the web the web in

644
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:16,340
my opinion it's these things are kind of

645
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:18,320
like incremental skills and these aren't

646
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,450
new ideas right like the whole idea

647
00:24:20,450 --> 00:24:22,669
behind discoverability was this right

648
00:24:22,669 --> 00:24:26,179
like that there are things that you put

649
00:24:26,179 --> 00:24:27,980
in the people can discover that then pay

650
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:29,970
dividends forever afterwards

651
00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:31,500
and in fact there are some things that

652
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:33,240
are so important right when we were

653
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:36,090
first making like UI computers that we

654
00:24:36,090 --> 00:24:37,500
said we shouldn't even leave it up to

655
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:39,360
the application makers they should be at

656
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,610
the system level right like if we handle

657
00:24:41,610 --> 00:24:43,230
copy paste then we make sure you only

658
00:24:43,230 --> 00:24:45,210
have to learn copy paste once right if

659
00:24:45,210 --> 00:24:46,800
we handle like the way you organize apps

660
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,210
you only have to learn that once if you

661
00:24:48,210 --> 00:24:50,730
learn files and you can like use apps

662
00:24:50,730 --> 00:24:53,370
together and I really fundamentally

663
00:24:53,370 --> 00:24:55,050
believe that you know it's been 30 years

664
00:24:55,050 --> 00:24:56,580
since we came up with these original

665
00:24:56,580 --> 00:25:00,120
concepts that we can graduate and kind

666
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:03,150
of add this new layer I think that in

667
00:25:03,150 --> 00:25:05,010
the past 30 years we've observed how

668
00:25:05,010 --> 00:25:07,290
people want to use computers and the

669
00:25:07,290 --> 00:25:11,030
fundamentals that the browser gives you

670
00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:14,940
really handle these new behaviors really

671
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:16,980
well right like people want to share

672
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:18,900
stuff right it should things should be

673
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:20,730
shareable by default not if you happen

674
00:25:20,730 --> 00:25:22,020
to put the share button in right like

675
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:24,060
people really want to be able to like

676
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:25,110
kind of duplicate their screen

677
00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:26,430
everything should have tabs it shouldn't

678
00:25:26,430 --> 00:25:28,620
be up to like us to implement tabs right

679
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:29,910
like fine should just work across

680
00:25:29,910 --> 00:25:31,170
everything whether it's a button or

681
00:25:31,170 --> 00:25:33,600
whether it's content and the really cool

682
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,580
thing about like kind of this this

683
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:38,070
proposal of these kind of like behaviors

684
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:40,860
that sit in between here is that they

685
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:43,260
all fundamentally rely on these two core

686
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:45,930
technologies plain text delivery and the

687
00:25:45,930 --> 00:25:48,300
URL right how does history work it just

688
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:49,980
keeps a list of URLs how does searching

689
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:51,690
history work well it keeps a list of

690
00:25:51,690 --> 00:25:53,310
URLs and it can search the plain text

691
00:25:53,310 --> 00:25:55,170
right like how does find in page work

692
00:25:55,170 --> 00:25:56,820
well thankfully since it's plain text

693
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:59,880
you can find it right and this is what I

694
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,560
think makes a web the web right like if

695
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:04,590
we had like shipped the web using s

696
00:26:04,590 --> 00:26:06,720
expressions instead of HTML and Python

697
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:09,060
instead of JavaScript the web would

698
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:13,830
still be the web because of this so I

699
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:15,090
think there's like a big problem and

700
00:26:15,090 --> 00:26:17,160
everything I'm saying right or Elif in

701
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:21,030
the room or something if it's true that

702
00:26:21,030 --> 00:26:22,800
these things are so amazing right the

703
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:25,890
history and tabs and everything then why

704
00:26:25,890 --> 00:26:30,080
aren't people kind of missing it right

705
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:32,370
why don't people miss it when they go

706
00:26:32,370 --> 00:26:33,780
and use the native thing right do you

707
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:34,920
guys remember when we first got the

708
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:36,810
first iPhone it didn't have copy/paste

709
00:26:36,810 --> 00:26:38,340
and you were like staring at your phone

710
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:40,650
at this piece of text and thinking to

711
00:26:40,650 --> 00:26:42,150
yourself am i honestly can have to

712
00:26:42,150 --> 00:26:43,560
memorize this like a cave

713
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:46,050
and then retype it into text messages

714
00:26:46,050 --> 00:26:48,690
like they were livid and so we got copy

715
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:50,670
paste why aren't people like crying out

716
00:26:50,670 --> 00:26:52,050
for history why aren't people crying out

717
00:26:52,050 --> 00:26:54,690
for tabs right so what idea is that

718
00:26:54,690 --> 00:26:56,580
oh you know maybe since it's we went

719
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:58,440
from like desktop to mobile these like

720
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,790
ideas don't really make that much sense

721
00:26:59,790 --> 00:27:01,170
never I don't think that's true right

722
00:27:01,170 --> 00:27:02,760
like I think the proliferation of the

723
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:05,510
send box to heaven button should be a

724
00:27:05,510 --> 00:27:08,610
clear indication that people want

725
00:27:08,610 --> 00:27:11,610
sharing in all these things so I think

726
00:27:11,610 --> 00:27:13,170
the reason people aren't clamoring for

727
00:27:13,170 --> 00:27:15,840
these features is that you know I just

728
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,400
sat here and gave you this very ideal

729
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,890
view of like history and stuff but the

730
00:27:19,890 --> 00:27:21,780
reality is that's what history actually

731
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:24,300
looks like right it's it's horrible it's

732
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:25,260
like it's like if you're a cocoa

733
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:26,280
programmer you know that this is

734
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:28,170
literally taking a tableview dragging it

735
00:27:28,170 --> 00:27:29,790
and thank God they remembered to resize

736
00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:30,810
it to fit the window because that's

737
00:27:30,810 --> 00:27:34,200
about all the work they did right and if

738
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:36,480
I do a search which is buried at the

739
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:39,660
bottom right oh hey 3,000 matches was

740
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:41,550
that full-text search just to just title

741
00:27:41,550 --> 00:27:42,690
and I don't know you figure it out you

742
00:27:42,690 --> 00:27:45,260
bought the computer I don't know like

743
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:48,570
the only incremental skill to learn here

744
00:27:48,570 --> 00:27:51,030
is to remember to delete your history

745
00:27:51,030 --> 00:27:52,380
before you give it to someone else right

746
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:56,400
like that's it if you just think about

747
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,770
it for half a second right like it's

748
00:27:58,770 --> 00:28:01,680
crazy we live in an era where quite

749
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:04,980
possibly the smartest minds are as we

750
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:06,510
speak working on determining your

751
00:28:06,510 --> 00:28:09,750
browsing behavior right the NSA is p's

752
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:12,900
ads and even the college I go to knows

753
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:14,940
more about my browsing history than I do

754
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:16,650
and that's a whole nother discussion

755
00:28:16,650 --> 00:28:18,270
whether they should be like snooping on

756
00:28:18,270 --> 00:28:19,980
me or not whatever that's a different

757
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:22,170
discussion but at least at least if

758
00:28:22,170 --> 00:28:23,640
you're gonna have all this data on me

759
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:25,110
make it available to me at least let me

760
00:28:25,110 --> 00:28:27,750
also have a chance to like be able to

761
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:29,520
search for my history in a good way

762
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:32,790
right so I wouldn't want to give you an

763
00:28:32,790 --> 00:28:34,140
alternative view of what history could

764
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:38,430
be like and so it's kind of just a quick

765
00:28:38,430 --> 00:28:41,460
redesign and this isn't so important

766
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:43,140
right now the big the ideas here just

767
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:45,210
like hey we don't need to see eight

768
00:28:45,210 --> 00:28:47,130
hundred items in one page right Google

769
00:28:47,130 --> 00:28:48,300
doesn't do that you only need to see a

770
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:50,970
couple you can scroll to see the rest

771
00:28:50,970 --> 00:28:52,590
it'd be really nice if I could actually

772
00:28:52,590 --> 00:28:54,690
see the page and have a good idea that

773
00:28:54,690 --> 00:28:56,310
it's full text search or whatever but

774
00:28:56,310 --> 00:28:59,040
this isn't like the biggest deal so

775
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:03,390
again there there you go the big deal

776
00:29:03,390 --> 00:29:05,220
for me is once you have like a really

777
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:07,500
great foundation for history you can

778
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:09,030
start doing this kind of composition

779
00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:11,490
right so the one I'm really interested

780
00:29:11,490 --> 00:29:14,490
is is you know composing html5 with

781
00:29:14,490 --> 00:29:18,870
history so I was looking at this really

782
00:29:18,870 --> 00:29:21,300
awesome making of Jurassic world thing

783
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:23,160
because it puts together the best things

784
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:28,050
ever dinosaurs and computers and I this

785
00:29:28,050 --> 00:29:29,970
happens to me a lot I could sworn I've

786
00:29:29,970 --> 00:29:32,100
seen this video but what I do search for

787
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:34,320
it it doesn't come up right and the way

788
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:35,370
searches you know addresses world

789
00:29:35,370 --> 00:29:37,140
YouTube because that's where probably

790
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:43,650
saw it now the browser knows what sites

791
00:29:43,650 --> 00:29:45,840
have videos right that's a point of

792
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:48,450
semantic stuff right the video tag so

793
00:29:48,450 --> 00:29:52,500
why not record when a site has video so

794
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:54,060
then I can make a more reasonable kind

795
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:56,880
of search right I can do something like

796
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,230
this and oh that's why I didn't come up

797
00:29:58,230 --> 00:29:59,910
cuz it was a Vimeo site and I don't take

798
00:29:59,910 --> 00:30:01,410
the time to memorize the different

799
00:30:01,410 --> 00:30:05,130
brands right so if the browser knows

800
00:30:05,130 --> 00:30:06,930
about video tags it can expose that to

801
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:08,910
me in a way that's more incremental

802
00:30:08,910 --> 00:30:10,530
right and lets me know that it has some

803
00:30:10,530 --> 00:30:11,880
sort of knowledge about video without

804
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,740
having me know necessarily about html5

805
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:17,450
right and again

806
00:30:17,450 --> 00:30:19,920
the browser also knows a bunch of

807
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,450
semantic information so let's just go

808
00:30:21,450 --> 00:30:23,280
ahead and show you the poster images so

809
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:24,510
I don't have to play Where's Waldo with

810
00:30:24,510 --> 00:30:26,910
this thing right and you can do the kind

811
00:30:26,910 --> 00:30:28,410
of the same thing with audio right if

812
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:31,590
you have audio tags that's even more

813
00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:33,420
powerful in my opinion because it's much

814
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:34,560
more likely that you're listening to

815
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:36,800
lots of different audio sources and so I

816
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,970
was listening to a song I don't really

817
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:40,440
know the name so I don't put a search

818
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:42,150
thing in there I just select music and

819
00:30:42,150 --> 00:30:44,280
of course I just get like the songs I

820
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:46,590
listen to again determined by the audio

821
00:30:46,590 --> 00:30:51,380
tag in descending order of time and

822
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:53,790
again the really cool thing about a

823
00:30:53,790 --> 00:30:57,240
semantic is that information is that it

824
00:30:57,240 --> 00:31:00,360
knows where the file lives right so why

825
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:01,800
not make that available to me and just

826
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:03,330
let me play them right and just store

827
00:31:03,330 --> 00:31:06,090
the string URL and now I can kind of

828
00:31:06,090 --> 00:31:09,080
search the music by sound instead of

829
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:10,880
having to try to remember the name of

830
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,260
the song or whatever which again it's

831
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:14,150
probably not very likely because things

832
00:31:14,150 --> 00:31:15,530
just play and just go to the next song

833
00:31:15,530 --> 00:31:18,680
or whatever so I feel as if history

834
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:21,650
looked something more like that then you

835
00:31:21,650 --> 00:31:23,000
would all of a sudden start seeing

836
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,950
people who missed history when you went

837
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:26,870
to native write like they'd say hey I

838
00:31:26,870 --> 00:31:29,090
was listening to music in these three

839
00:31:29,090 --> 00:31:30,860
different iOS apps and I want to know

840
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:32,570
what song it is I now think it's

841
00:31:32,570 --> 00:31:34,250
ridiculous that I have to open up three

842
00:31:34,250 --> 00:31:36,140
iOS apps and check all three which is

843
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:37,850
the way we felt with copy-paste where we

844
00:31:37,850 --> 00:31:40,280
said hey I had a good solution for copy

845
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:43,970
paste now I don't anymore right and in

846
00:31:43,970 --> 00:31:45,290
my opinion I think the discussion would

847
00:31:45,290 --> 00:31:46,730
be more mirrored where like it would be

848
00:31:46,730 --> 00:31:49,340
more trade off II like hey you know with

849
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:50,960
native you might get fast but you don't

850
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:53,840
get all these other nice features and

851
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,280
more importantly I think that that gives

852
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:56,900
you the opportunity to build these Pro

853
00:31:56,900 --> 00:32:00,290
users right I can't really go to my dad

854
00:32:00,290 --> 00:32:02,510
and try to get him on board with like

855
00:32:02,510 --> 00:32:04,430
the audio tag or the video tag is it

856
00:32:04,430 --> 00:32:05,840
mean anything to him he doesn't care

857
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:11,420
however if in his music search one of

858
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:12,800
the results doesn't have a play button

859
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,960
because it uses flash from music instead

860
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:17,390
of you know the audio tag he will get

861
00:32:17,390 --> 00:32:19,010
upset and possibly tell the site hey

862
00:32:19,010 --> 00:32:20,900
your site's broken it doesn't work here

863
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:22,490
right this is what I mean by the kind of

864
00:32:22,490 --> 00:32:23,990
like the benefit of these Pro users

865
00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:26,300
you've just created a secret html5

866
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:28,040
advocate without him knowing it he's

867
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:30,920
starting to build this idea that the web

868
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:34,910
works in certain ways and again that may

869
00:32:34,910 --> 00:32:36,650
have different returns he may just go

870
00:32:36,650 --> 00:32:38,300
and complain to the site but he may also

871
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:40,430
go and try to help the site implement

872
00:32:40,430 --> 00:32:41,870
that like I've seen that happen right

873
00:32:41,870 --> 00:32:43,640
like if you look at cocoa apps like

874
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:45,590
people really like to go and write the

875
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:47,690
localization files for people is it any

876
00:32:47,690 --> 00:32:49,850
surprise that the only open part of a

877
00:32:49,850 --> 00:32:51,770
cocoa app write the localization file is

878
00:32:51,770 --> 00:32:53,750
the one that people actually contribute

879
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:56,990
to in droves and I think like a really

880
00:32:56,990 --> 00:32:58,130
good example of that is this site

881
00:32:58,130 --> 00:33:00,650
wanting Connie if you want to check it

882
00:33:00,650 --> 00:33:03,410
out it's for learning Japanese but they

883
00:33:03,410 --> 00:33:05,000
built it in such a way that it's like

884
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,670
really tink horrible and people have

885
00:33:07,670 --> 00:33:09,350
gone and made just like thousands of

886
00:33:09,350 --> 00:33:12,290
different apps for it and if you go read

887
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:15,650
the forum's like all the comments are or

888
00:33:15,650 --> 00:33:17,300
many of these are hey I've never

889
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:19,130
programmed before but I really had this

890
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:21,140
H I wanted to scratch and this was kind

891
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:22,400
of easy too

892
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:25,900
back around and I was able to build this

893
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:28,370
again HyperCard very much had that idea

894
00:33:28,370 --> 00:33:29,840
right like every app was like

895
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:31,790
fundamentally editable you got an app

896
00:33:31,790 --> 00:33:33,320
and you could like change the behaviors

897
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:35,150
of the buttons and we kind of get that

898
00:33:35,150 --> 00:33:36,350
for free with the web right you can

899
00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:37,580
inspect an element and kind of start

900
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:39,440
understanding how it works and I think

901
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:41,030
this was also the original vision of the

902
00:33:41,030 --> 00:33:42,380
web like if you look at and that's skate

903
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:45,380
for it came with an editor built-in

904
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:47,030
right and if you look at the original

905
00:33:47,030 --> 00:33:50,630
idea of the web it was for scientists to

906
00:33:50,630 --> 00:33:52,520
share right like the idea of shipping a

907
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:54,860
browser that couldn't edit documents was

908
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:55,880
kind of like shipping Microsoft Word

909
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:57,350
without letting you edit like it was

910
00:33:57,350 --> 00:34:00,410
only doing half its job and I think it's

911
00:34:00,410 --> 00:34:01,880
really unfortunate that the web is

912
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:03,800
becoming more read-only in my opinion

913
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:04,820
and that's kind of the reason I wanted

914
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:06,830
to give a talk here at JSC um

915
00:34:06,830 --> 00:34:09,679
because every one to you is a creator

916
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:11,960
right and that makes you part of a

917
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:15,440
really cool Club and as a creator you

918
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:17,480
have a lot more influence than you think

919
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:19,700
either in the apps you create yourself

920
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:21,740
like in the example of one Akane they

921
00:34:21,740 --> 00:34:23,450
built it in a way that actually inspires

922
00:34:23,450 --> 00:34:25,460
our users to kind of become creators

923
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:27,860
themselves or just in the things you

924
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:31,100
choose to you know request out of your

925
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:32,690
browser right like we are the ones who

926
00:34:32,690 --> 00:34:33,800
come up with new ideas for browser

927
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,480
features and go and bug the developers

928
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:38,120
right usually it's not them like average

929
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:40,640
user and I think that in our community

930
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:43,460
we have kind of this general sense that

931
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:45,409
we'd like this club of creators to be

932
00:34:45,409 --> 00:34:49,370
bigger I certainly feel that way I know

933
00:34:49,370 --> 00:34:51,169
I wish I could talk to my dad about the

934
00:34:51,169 --> 00:34:53,720
things I do more and I feel that back

935
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:57,620
then I actually had a better chance of

936
00:34:57,620 --> 00:34:58,910
getting stuff across to him because

937
00:34:58,910 --> 00:35:00,110
again he was like actually building

938
00:35:00,110 --> 00:35:01,880
sites and stuff back then and now he

939
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:03,110
feels like he's very separate from that

940
00:35:03,110 --> 00:35:04,460
it's like Oh something I have to learn

941
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:06,230
right and I think that's a really sad

942
00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:11,590
transition to make I think if we start

943
00:35:11,590 --> 00:35:14,750
kind of thinking about this way of

944
00:35:14,750 --> 00:35:16,310
teaching stuff this incremental way as

945
00:35:16,310 --> 00:35:18,200
opposed to kind of these first-order

946
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:19,550
approaches like oh how do we make

947
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:21,020
programming languages easier or how do

948
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:23,270
we teach a class or whatever instead we

949
00:35:23,270 --> 00:35:25,370
kind of think about how can we make the

950
00:35:25,370 --> 00:35:27,500
environment itself like more

951
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:30,410
fundamentally incremental it starts to

952
00:35:30,410 --> 00:35:31,850
inform a lot of other discussions we

953
00:35:31,850 --> 00:35:33,170
have that we never really thought had

954
00:35:33,170 --> 00:35:34,790
anything to do with teaching programming

955
00:35:34,790 --> 00:35:36,170
like a really good example

956
00:35:36,170 --> 00:35:38,329
good UI like we talked a lot about good

957
00:35:38,329 --> 00:35:40,220
UI like Oh flat vs. scheme or fake or

958
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:42,349
you know fits law but good UI doesn't

959
00:35:42,349 --> 00:35:43,609
really mean anything unless you know

960
00:35:43,609 --> 00:35:46,460
what it's good for right and so if you

961
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:48,020
ask yourself when you're building an app

962
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:49,609
or you're building your browser like am

963
00:35:49,609 --> 00:35:51,770
I trying to build an appliance is this

964
00:35:51,770 --> 00:35:53,480
like a one-off am I trying to build

965
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:55,700
something that is basically for a user

966
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:57,589
that's at the end of their journey right

967
00:35:57,589 --> 00:36:01,010
like they've come in and they're gonna

968
00:36:01,010 --> 00:36:02,390
do this one task and then they're gonna

969
00:36:02,390 --> 00:36:05,480
leave and that's it that that means kind

970
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:07,970
of a very different kind of UI then if

971
00:36:07,970 --> 00:36:08,960
you're building something more like a

972
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,670
calculator which is something that's at

973
00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:12,470
the beginning or the middle of your

974
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:16,160
users journey right and that's it thank
