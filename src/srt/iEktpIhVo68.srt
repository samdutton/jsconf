00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:10,030

I'm so happy to be here I can't really

2
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:12,370
express my gratitude to Chris for

3
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:15,519
inviting me and for making this happen

4
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:18,520
and it was awesome to follow jid he's a

5
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:23,020
good friend and a good opener hopefully

6
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:24,369
hopefully you guys will laugh more

7
00:00:24,369 --> 00:00:28,630
because he he's awesome and I don't have

8
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:32,290
to do as much work so anyway moving on

9
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:38,140
on a cue I don't I really didn't when I

10
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:40,120
saw the Jays conf last call it was like

11
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:42,339
a call to arms for me to come and

12
00:00:42,339 --> 00:00:45,850
support Chris and Laura and everything

13
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:47,890
they've done and so I didn't know what

14
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:49,360
to talk about I haven't really written

15
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:51,790
that much javascript in a while even

16
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:53,500
though i did a talk at brooklyn j/s

17
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:55,299
recently it was about go cuz i'm

18
00:00:55,299 --> 00:00:59,739
obviously an old person and so I I

19
00:00:59,739 --> 00:01:01,750
didn't know exactly what to talk about I

20
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:03,670
realized I thought the first talk I gave

21
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:06,070
it a jazz conf was five years ago or a

22
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:07,780
little more than five years ago at jas

23
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:12,250
com 2010 and a lot in my life has

24
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:14,860
happened since then and I wanted to talk

25
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:17,230
about that because I think I learned

26
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:20,260
some things so I'm going to try to teach

27
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:22,360
all of you all the things that I learned

28
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:24,760
in five years in about 40 minutes are

29
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:27,880
you guys ready for that cool so first

30
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:29,890
let's start with the basics how to speak

31
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:34,330
at j s com 2010 so it all started Jed

32
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:35,950
was kind of mentioning this there was a

33
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:38,860
there was a nascent JavaScript community

34
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:42,670
in New York in 2009-2010 I was one of

35
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:44,950
the organizers of NYC j/s with a friend

36
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:48,760
Brian Mitchell who sadly isn't here

37
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:52,000
today but he's an awesome person and at

38
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,110
NYC j/s in some time in 2010 Chris

39
00:01:56,110 --> 00:01:58,030
Williams spoke there are about seven

40
00:01:58,030 --> 00:01:59,710
people there which was awesome because

41
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:01,150
that was the JavaScript community in New

42
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:06,130
York then and we after the after the

43
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:08,470
talk Chris did a little talk we went to

44
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:12,730
this bar as you do called ginger man and

45
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:14,500
we had some beers and I heard that

46
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,090
Jessica's coming up this is my first

47
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:17,740
time meeting Chris we went to this

48
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:18,870
little back room we start

49
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:21,569
talking I had some beers and I was at

50
00:02:21,569 --> 00:02:23,040
that point I was working in JavaScript I

51
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,540
really wanted to talk to Jess comp I

52
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:26,220
hadn't gone to 2009 which was the first

53
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:28,799
year 2010 was a second I really really

54
00:02:28,799 --> 00:02:30,390
really wanted to talk and so I was

55
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:31,890
telling you about my framework and the

56
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:33,360
things that I wanted to talk about and

57
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,830
he was like no you're not allowed to

58
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:36,180
talk about a JavaScript framework or

59
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:37,950
framework sucks you're full of

60
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:41,250
don't do that I was like well listen I

61
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:43,140
have other hobbies what if I talk about

62
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:45,599
baking or how I make bacon myself he's

63
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:49,290
like yes um he was like basically if

64
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:52,410
you'd give a talk about bacon I will

65
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:54,319
make you the keynote presentation and

66
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:56,430
this was like a couple of beers in I

67
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:57,420
don't know if he was serious I was like

68
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:00,209
okay cool let's do it and I was like in

69
00:03:00,209 --> 00:03:02,099
mind make bacon on stage is that a thing

70
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:03,239
that we can do and he was a gay and

71
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:04,709
we'll figure it out with the hotel we

72
00:03:04,709 --> 00:03:06,120
didn't actually get to make bacon on

73
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,879
stage but I did make a little video this

74
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:11,220
is me five years ago you can still watch

75
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:14,280
this video it's pretty funny Brian

76
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,109
Mitchell made it I look so young and

77
00:03:16,109 --> 00:03:20,519
ambitious then what happened and yeah

78
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:22,709
I'm still making bacon this was from a

79
00:03:22,709 --> 00:03:24,480
couple of couple months ago it's

80
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,489
delicious if you want to learn how to

81
00:03:26,489 --> 00:03:28,859
make bacon watch that talk but thinking

82
00:03:28,859 --> 00:03:31,139
is a gateway drug to many many other

83
00:03:31,139 --> 00:03:34,319
things so I want to tell you how to cure

84
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:35,700
sausage is something I learned in the

85
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:37,470
past couple years securing bacon is

86
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:40,950
pretty simple you take your bacon you if

87
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:42,569
you want a more detail go watch the talk

88
00:03:42,569 --> 00:03:44,250
you take a pork belly you take salt you

89
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:45,900
take the special curing salt and you

90
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:48,180
take time and you let it cure over

91
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:50,129
around time and then you add some smoke

92
00:03:50,129 --> 00:03:52,079
and you have bacon and it's delicious

93
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:53,609
it's really really simple the

94
00:03:53,609 --> 00:03:56,310
ingredients are so so small that really

95
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:58,319
anyone can do it at home the smoke part

96
00:03:58,319 --> 00:03:59,549
is the only part that you might not be

97
00:03:59,549 --> 00:04:01,109
able to do in a Brooklyn kitchen but

98
00:04:01,109 --> 00:04:02,730
you're like me at that time I had like a

99
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:04,769
little kettle grill on a balcony and I

100
00:04:04,769 --> 00:04:06,239
was able to do it and piss my neighbors

101
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:10,139
off and it was awesome so sausage isn't

102
00:04:10,139 --> 00:04:11,370
that different I was always really

103
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:12,660
interested in the idea of sausage

104
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:14,639
because it's like the next level from

105
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:16,229
bacon so I'm like always trying to level

106
00:04:16,229 --> 00:04:18,979
up how do you cure sausage so you are

107
00:04:18,979 --> 00:04:20,910
it's not that different you can see

108
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:21,900
there's only a couple different things

109
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:24,060
there's pork and salt and seasonings and

110
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:25,919
then the big difference is is you have

111
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:28,650
these friendly bacteria and you have to

112
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:30,719
have a specific temperature and humidity

113
00:04:30,719 --> 00:04:32,110
and then time is the same

114
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:35,080
so the friendly bacteria it's easy you

115
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,370
can order friendly bacteria on the

116
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:40,060
internet on amazon com you get them and

117
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:42,150
you add them to your sausage mix and

118
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:45,040
they basically friendly bacteria or the

119
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,840
bacteria that grow on the outside

120
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:48,430
especially by a sausage at a store it's

121
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:50,170
covered in white mold and you're like oh

122
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:52,000
that's gross it's white those white

123
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,160
molds are good they're good mold that's

124
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,660
keeping away the bad mold that's black

125
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:57,340
and green you see any black and green on

126
00:04:57,340 --> 00:05:00,370
it don't eat it first rule of sausage

127
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:05,680
and so if you if you but in order to get

128
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,240
those bacteria to grow you need a

129
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,610
specific temperature and humidity when

130
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:10,960
you're occurring bacon who's put in the

131
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,220
fridge it doesn't matter top shelf

132
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:13,540
bottom shelf it doesn't matter with

133
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:15,880
sopressata which is one of my favorite

134
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,680
types of Italian sausage you need to

135
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,390
keep the humidity around eighty percent

136
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:21,100
or higher and you need to keep the

137
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:24,160
temperature in around 55 degrees because

138
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,930
that's where the friendly bacteria

139
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:28,300
thrive anything out of that and you

140
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:30,580
might get those green and black ones

141
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:33,640
which you don't like so how to make a

142
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:35,650
raspberry pi in nodejs monitored sausage

143
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:37,000
curing chamber so obviously as a

144
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,950
programmer that's the next thing that

145
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:41,410
comes to mind obviously right so you got

146
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:42,850
your sausage you got a little fridge

147
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:45,880
there's a raspberry pi on top some wires

148
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:49,780
dangling scarily into the into the into

149
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:54,400
the fridge and this is basically like a

150
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,810
layout of how it works you got your

151
00:05:55,810 --> 00:05:58,420
sausage you have this thing called the

152
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:00,130
DHT 22 which is a temperature and

153
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:02,410
humidity thing you have a Raspberry Pi

154
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:04,090
that can run nodejs which is awesome

155
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:07,330
that sends these metrics to Heroku which

156
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:09,340
is a little a brownie on roku and those

157
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:12,040
metrics get sent to librado and if the

158
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,900
temperature goes too high or too low

159
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:15,580
then you send a text message to yourself

160
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:19,090
so you know to check your sausage I have

161
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:20,620
an app that's running unfortunately my

162
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:22,120
sausage fridge isn't running right now

163
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,920
so I don't have it running and I

164
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,300
realized it never took a screenshot of

165
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:27,030
it in action which is really really sad

166
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:29,320
but we you know this kind of follows a

167
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:31,000
theme of what we were talking about all

168
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,150
day this is the internet of tasty things

169
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:36,460
and it's something I'm really interested

170
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:40,480
in at one point I got really excited I

171
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,590
was like I'm going to add a camera in

172
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:43,270
there and this is what I can't wear my

173
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:45,880
sausage for it looks like

174
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:48,500
it didn't you could really do anything I

175
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,889
just got really excited about it I

176
00:06:50,889 --> 00:06:54,080
actually I had to scrap that project but

177
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,880
of course once you get Sasha saying and

178
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,139
you realize that oh there's like some

179
00:06:57,139 --> 00:06:59,389
cool stuff going on here you get more

180
00:06:59,389 --> 00:07:01,460
into this whole idea of how do you

181
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:02,930
pickle things like what is that what

182
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:04,639
does that process look like and then you

183
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:06,290
have some parties where you have like

184
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:08,210
giant plates and Fickell's because your

185
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:09,889
entire freezer and fridge is filled with

186
00:07:09,889 --> 00:07:13,340
pickles and not even joking i've had to

187
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:15,229
that sausage fringe has now become a

188
00:07:15,229 --> 00:07:16,639
pickle for age because i ran out of room

189
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:18,400
in my fridge to store all my pic hose

190
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:22,220
and a pickling is actually what got me

191
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:23,960
into making bacon and this whole thing

192
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,250
but it's gotten a little further there

193
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:26,870
you have some pastrami and some coppa

194
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:29,780
and some sopressata and some duck

195
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:31,880
prosciutto which is amazing pickled corn

196
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:35,150
who hears had pickled corn it's so fine

197
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:37,630
it's amazing pickle yourself some corn

198
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:41,720
and the one thing I'll tell you this

199
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:45,590
fermentation you can get deep and I did

200
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:48,979
uh I highly recommend this book called

201
00:07:48,979 --> 00:07:52,850
the fermentation Bible by Sandra cats

202
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:55,100
it's literally the size of a Bible and

203
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,660
it has everything you ever wanted to

204
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:58,970
know about it I just got this book um

205
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:01,250
that my wife is going to kill me it's

206
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:04,490
called the what's called how to preserve

207
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:07,669
the Japanese way of preserving and I'm

208
00:08:07,669 --> 00:08:10,250
gonna start making me so why not fish

209
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:13,210
sauce is where my wife draws the line so

210
00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:16,700
yeah but fermentation is everywhere so

211
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:18,200
you start getting these ideas in your

212
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,729
head about what fermentation is and what

213
00:08:19,729 --> 00:08:22,190
it can do because look at this that

214
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:24,139
looks kind of familiar right you have

215
00:08:24,139 --> 00:08:26,270
the same ingredients on the right side s

216
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:28,849
as bacon it's just the ingredients in

217
00:08:28,849 --> 00:08:31,039
front of it are different you have flour

218
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:34,010
and water and flour and water plus time

219
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:36,140
you start the starter and you start

220
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:38,360
building it you build it and this

221
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:42,140
miracle of two things combined you have

222
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:43,820
bread you have this beautiful beautiful

223
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:44,990
bread and I've been obsessed with bread

224
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:47,839
for a long time I'm pissing off all the

225
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:49,459
gluten-free people and the vegans in the

226
00:08:49,459 --> 00:08:53,060
audience but that's okay you got to do

227
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:55,769
it sometime so

228
00:08:55,769 --> 00:09:01,360
then the you this bread was made was all

229
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,399
just those ingredients it's so simple

230
00:09:03,399 --> 00:09:04,779
obviously there's some sesame seeds on

231
00:09:04,779 --> 00:09:08,610
the left just so just for taste and so

232
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:11,290
you get this idea in your head that you

233
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:12,910
can take these two things and combine

234
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:14,529
them and basically let nature take its

235
00:09:14,529 --> 00:09:15,730
course and this is a really beautiful

236
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:19,630
and I don't know to me it's almost like

237
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:21,610
moving like I'm really moved by

238
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:23,860
fermentation and buy bread because I

239
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:25,540
know that sounds crazy but it's like

240
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:27,459
it's the simplest thing and it's been

241
00:09:27,459 --> 00:09:28,810
going on since almost the beginning of

242
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:30,389
time someone figured out that you

243
00:09:30,389 --> 00:09:32,649
combine these two things and they make

244
00:09:32,649 --> 00:09:34,959
something delicious but even with that

245
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:37,000
with those two things these simple

246
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,819
ingredients it takes years and years and

247
00:09:39,819 --> 00:09:42,069
centuries of practice to get to what we

248
00:09:42,069 --> 00:09:43,990
have today and something about that is

249
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:46,380
amazing right you take these very

250
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:50,259
organics base ingredients and turn them

251
00:09:50,259 --> 00:09:52,180
into something special but that making

252
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:54,040
it something special as craft right and

253
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:56,079
I'm not saying I'm amazing at it I don't

254
00:09:56,079 --> 00:09:57,870
have that centuries of experience yet

255
00:09:57,870 --> 00:10:01,269
but I I'm trying to download everything

256
00:10:01,269 --> 00:10:03,940
I can and learn how to do this so

257
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:05,980
they're easier ways to get into this

258
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,990
then the mastering the art of the

259
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:10,690
sourdough and that's Pizza Pizza is the

260
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:12,490
most basic form of fermentation if you

261
00:10:12,490 --> 00:10:15,519
do it right it's the same thing you got

262
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:17,230
your flower you got your water you've

263
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:19,000
got your yeast you don't have to let you

264
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,160
add yeast to kick start it and you have

265
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:23,829
these beautiful balls of dough and pizza

266
00:10:23,829 --> 00:10:25,899
is all this you add this extra thing

267
00:10:25,899 --> 00:10:28,800
which is that people love pizza

268
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,510
and people love eating it and people

269
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:33,310
love sharing it it's just communal food

270
00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:34,990
that gets people together and gets

271
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:36,430
people excited about being with each

272
00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:41,550
other it's my homeboy mrb shoutout so

273
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:44,199
you get really into this thing of making

274
00:10:44,199 --> 00:10:45,490
peace or her I get really into the

275
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:47,889
single making pizza over 10 years and

276
00:10:47,889 --> 00:10:50,740
you make a lot a lot of pizzas and you

277
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:52,300
get really really good at it and it's

278
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:54,730
awesome everyone likes you because you

279
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:58,750
give them pizza how easy is that so from

280
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:00,819
there then you make so many pieces and

281
00:11:00,819 --> 00:11:02,110
what do you do you have to write a book

282
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:04,029
about it obviously and how do you write

283
00:11:04,029 --> 00:11:05,860
a book about pizza easy you make a lot

284
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:07,450
of pizza

285
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:10,610
so Mike and I have started on this

286
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:12,830
journey and we paired up with this

287
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:14,510
amazing designer named Steve berry and

288
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:16,760
we're making a book about making pizza

289
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,110
this isn't good my life of the past

290
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:20,450
month has been working on this book it's

291
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:23,750
beautiful here's a picture of it we're

292
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:26,030
raising money on Kickstarter we try to

293
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:27,800
raise twenty eight thousand dollars we

294
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:32,030
hit our goal in six days because people

295
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:35,780
love deep sorrow it's an easy easy thing

296
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:39,140
and so this is I'm bragging but I'm also

297
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:40,970
just super excited about this because

298
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:44,330
here is this little inkling of yeast and

299
00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:46,130
fermentation and it turned into this

300
00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:47,840
thing that people have paid us thirty

301
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,670
seven thousand dollars to do over the

302
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:50,960
next couple months which is just an

303
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,720
incredible thing so wait I got to go

304
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:56,870
back a little bit that's that's the

305
00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:58,190
entire keynote effects for the entire

306
00:11:58,190 --> 00:11:59,420
presentation you guys can all take a

307
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:02,600
breath because in 2010 there was a lot

308
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,370
of stuff other stuff going on and this

309
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:05,480
is the part where i talk a little about

310
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:09,620
javascript so how do you make a

311
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:13,330
client-side JavaScript framework in 2009

312
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:16,730
there wasn't a lot of things about how

313
00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:19,220
to do that i created this thing called

314
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:24,080
sam ejs and it was awesome it was a

315
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,820
really fun project this is my initial

316
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:30,230
commit thursday march 19 2009 you can

317
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:34,220
see I am very verbose and I was actually

318
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:35,690
doing this at a conference I was hanging

319
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:36,710
out with my friend Blake in his rainy

320
00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:38,660
and Blake miss grania is a creator of

321
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:40,700
Sinatra and I was like oh I'm doing a

322
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:42,110
lot of JavaScript these days what if I

323
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:43,790
take these ideas from Sinatra and

324
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:46,610
brought them to the client-side web and

325
00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:48,740
built on the JavaScript little did I

326
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:50,600
know that that was like a thing that

327
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,640
people hadn't really done this idea of

328
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:54,380
single page apps people were kind of

329
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:57,680
playing with in touching at it but no

330
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,690
one had built a thing to a tool to build

331
00:12:59,690 --> 00:13:02,480
them and I think Chris saw that and

332
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,880
didn't fully understand what I was

333
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,080
talking about when I thought said

334
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,940
jeaious framework he thought I was like

335
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:09,800
making another mood tools or something

336
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:12,530
like that but no I was really excited

337
00:13:12,530 --> 00:13:14,240
about this idea that you could build

338
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:17,630
applications with this simple tool and

339
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:18,920
you could make something really simple

340
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,209
that people

341
00:13:20,209 --> 00:13:22,550
we'll enjoy programming in and that was

342
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:25,069
my goal I really had fun and that took

343
00:13:25,069 --> 00:13:27,829
off we a lot of people were using it and

344
00:13:27,829 --> 00:13:30,139
then eventually other people like that

345
00:13:30,139 --> 00:13:33,889
idea and client-side apps became like a

346
00:13:33,889 --> 00:13:35,869
thing that everyone were was doing to

347
00:13:35,869 --> 00:13:37,759
the point there were a thousand

348
00:13:37,759 --> 00:13:39,709
frameworks to do it and that's exciting

349
00:13:39,709 --> 00:13:43,550
I'm so on to my next thing so there's an

350
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:45,139
easy there's an easier answer to how to

351
00:13:45,139 --> 00:13:48,730
eight open source make a framework um so

352
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:51,529
it turns out when you're starting out

353
00:13:51,529 --> 00:13:53,360
with open source things are pretty

354
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:56,480
groovy these are all the gifs on the

355
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,679
including in the presentation to

356
00:13:57,679 --> 00:13:59,540
jean-claude van damme dancing is just

357
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:04,579
too good so you uh you start out you're

358
00:14:04,579 --> 00:14:05,779
making this thing people are really

359
00:14:05,779 --> 00:14:07,279
excited about it people are contributing

360
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:09,439
and then you get a pull request or an

361
00:14:09,439 --> 00:14:12,889
issue where the the entire body of the

362
00:14:12,889 --> 00:14:15,319
issue basically is summarized by this

363
00:14:15,319 --> 00:14:17,959
sucks you're an idiot leave leave the

364
00:14:17,959 --> 00:14:21,709
earth and and how do you respond to that

365
00:14:21,709 --> 00:14:23,689
okay one of them you're like okay no I

366
00:14:23,689 --> 00:14:25,639
think I think I'm cool I'm staying here

367
00:14:25,639 --> 00:14:29,629
cool thanks bye and then two of them and

368
00:14:29,629 --> 00:14:32,209
then a hundred of them and then why

369
00:14:32,209 --> 00:14:33,709
doesn't your thing do the thing that

370
00:14:33,709 --> 00:14:35,600
backbone does why doesn't your saying do

371
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,449
the thing that angular does why doesn't

372
00:14:38,449 --> 00:14:42,889
your thing you know you know marry me

373
00:14:42,889 --> 00:14:46,009
and all these other things so you get

374
00:14:46,009 --> 00:14:48,799
tired of it and it drink it's draining I

375
00:14:48,799 --> 00:14:50,449
think remy is talking about this

376
00:14:50,449 --> 00:14:52,819
tomorrow um I don't know if this ship is

377
00:14:52,819 --> 00:14:54,439
going to play it's also just too good oh

378
00:14:54,439 --> 00:14:59,209
yeah there we go umm so so open source

379
00:14:59,209 --> 00:15:00,740
is awesome it's this amazing thing but I

380
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:02,389
got really burned out really quickly

381
00:15:02,389 --> 00:15:05,139
because it's really hard to maintain a

382
00:15:05,139 --> 00:15:08,059
group of positive contributors and I'm

383
00:15:08,059 --> 00:15:09,259
sure there are some people were doing an

384
00:15:09,259 --> 00:15:11,779
amazing job at this and I applaud them I

385
00:15:11,779 --> 00:15:13,850
was not doing an amazing job and there

386
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:16,040
are reasons for that I was doing other

387
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:19,999
things at that time I was working at

388
00:15:19,999 --> 00:15:21,259
this company called paperless post and I

389
00:15:21,259 --> 00:15:23,889
was growing a team so people was post

390
00:15:23,889 --> 00:15:27,230
was founded in 2009 and I started very

391
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:29,379
early on frivolous post also sponsored

392
00:15:29,379 --> 00:15:32,269
Jase comp 2012 and scottsdale and did

393
00:15:32,269 --> 00:15:33,520
these awesome photo

394
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:35,950
you can see here that's actually me on

395
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:37,270
the bottom but you can't tell without my

396
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:40,540
glasses that my eyes are super BD but

397
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:44,170
that's Mike on the right up and so in in

398
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:46,510
2015 this is what paperless post looks

399
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:48,970
like there are more than 1 million

400
00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:50,950
receivers every week the revenues and

401
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,810
the tens of millions of dollars there

402
00:15:52,810 --> 00:15:56,200
are more than 110 employees and 40 / 40

403
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,120
of those are developers and operations

404
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,650
and the offices across to you but

405
00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:01,210
actually I wrote the slide a while ago

406
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:02,200
and it's actually almost three now

407
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,400
they're they're building on a third

408
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,980
floor but this is all just to say that

409
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:07,810
in 2009 when I started working with them

410
00:16:07,810 --> 00:16:10,570
there were zero dollars zero receivers

411
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:13,150
for employees one full-time Deb

412
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:15,640
including myself and another consultants

413
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:17,980
and we were hanging out in this

414
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:20,500
windowless office akon seventeenth

415
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,900
Street that was also a women's lingerie

416
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:25,210
company where we just had floor cubicles

417
00:16:25,210 --> 00:16:26,320
in the middle of it and then these

418
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,360
posters of women's lingerie all around

419
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:30,670
us and it was the weirdest office I've

420
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:32,170
ever worked at my entire life there were

421
00:16:32,170 --> 00:16:33,970
no windows if it was raining I to text

422
00:16:33,970 --> 00:16:37,030
Mike and be like is it raining which was

423
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:39,760
a lesson in and of itself so over the

424
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:43,690
six years of doing this I learned a lot

425
00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:48,490
to say the least and I I wanted to share

426
00:16:48,490 --> 00:16:50,020
some of those lessons with you and these

427
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:52,840
are have nothing to do with sausage so

428
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:56,110
ah this is hard because there's six

429
00:16:56,110 --> 00:16:57,640
years of this stuff that I learned I'm

430
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:58,840
trying to condense it down it's like

431
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:02,170
four minutes so bear with me um one is

432
00:17:02,170 --> 00:17:04,839
you can learn by teaching so learning by

433
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:06,520
teaching is an interesting idea but it's

434
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,170
not just about mentoring it's about

435
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:12,310
really pushing yourself and challenging

436
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:14,470
yourself to get as much information as

437
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:19,240
you can out of other people buy them

438
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:20,560
everything that you know and this is

439
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:23,650
like an oz mosis type process and being

440
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:27,459
a teacher teaches you how to learn it

441
00:17:27,459 --> 00:17:29,050
doesn't isn't that weird it's a weird

442
00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:31,930
thing and being a mentor makes you

443
00:17:31,930 --> 00:17:33,760
better at learning new things and i

444
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,230
highly recommend doing it if you've

445
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:37,810
never done it before even if you're a a

446
00:17:37,810 --> 00:17:39,820
junior developer you can mentor someone

447
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:43,720
on something this is probably one of the

448
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:46,000
most important things which I didn't

449
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,290
learn until after I

450
00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:50,170
stopped being a manager which is seeking

451
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:53,020
clarity and not transparency when you're

452
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:54,700
a manager Anor you're in a part of a

453
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:58,180
team everybody wants to there's like

454
00:17:58,180 --> 00:17:59,530
this there was at least a couple years

455
00:17:59,530 --> 00:18:01,120
ago and still going on everyone's

456
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,860
transparency transparency we're a

457
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:04,180
transparent organization and

458
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:06,430
transparency means that information is

459
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:08,080
free basically like you can get any

460
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,540
information you want but information is

461
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:13,540
useless without context and when you're

462
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:16,030
seeking transparency what you're doing

463
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:18,460
is you're trying to open up lines of

464
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:20,260
communication but if you're not clear

465
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:22,840
about your intentions about that no

466
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:24,190
one's going to be motivated no one's

467
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:26,640
going to do anything so clarity and

468
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,270
understanding why you're doing what

469
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:30,580
you're doing is the most important and

470
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:34,020
that that goes into this too which is if

471
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:36,400
it doesn't really matter if you're

472
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,990
building in the new framework or you're

473
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:39,550
rewriting or doing whatever you're doing

474
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:41,650
it's the organization that you're

475
00:18:41,650 --> 00:18:43,240
working with you don't understand why

476
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:44,260
you're doing the thing that you're doing

477
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:46,020
or your developers or your team doesn't

478
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:49,420
they'll never ever ever do the right

479
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:51,670
thing and that's simple I mean maybe

480
00:18:51,670 --> 00:18:53,350
they will like monkeys in the typewriter

481
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:56,140
eventually do the right thing but it

482
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:58,390
it's much easier to give them the

483
00:18:58,390 --> 00:19:00,700
context in the Y to get them to do the

484
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:03,220
thing you want them to do or to get you

485
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:07,340
to do the thing that they want you to do

486
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:10,330
this is one of my personal pet peeves

487
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:13,270
and pet projects is to get everyone on

488
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:15,430
board with this idea people are obsessed

489
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:17,380
with rewriting everything and burning

490
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:18,580
the world down and started from scratch

491
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:21,220
and I hate that it's like my number one

492
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:24,400
pet peeve because I really truly believe

493
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,770
that you can take any almost anything

494
00:19:26,770 --> 00:19:29,650
and really do it in an incremental way

495
00:19:29,650 --> 00:19:32,830
that benefits everyone because giant

496
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:34,870
ideas are amorphous they have no shape

497
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:37,510
people don't understand them and if you

498
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:38,950
can break something down into smaller

499
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:40,480
chunks that people can actually

500
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,520
understand maybe they'll get it maybe

501
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:44,610
they'll maybe they'll move forward and

502
00:19:44,610 --> 00:19:47,440
finally the most important thing is

503
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:51,010
caring about people like software is

504
00:19:51,010 --> 00:19:53,740
people like I don't know how many times

505
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:55,630
I've had to I've had to scream this to

506
00:19:55,630 --> 00:19:59,050
the clouds but software is actually

507
00:19:59,050 --> 00:20:00,590
about people like it

508
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:02,000
doesn't matter what language you write

509
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,700
in javascript is cool go as cool ruby is

510
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:07,460
cool PHP is awesome cool it's great it

511
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:09,650
doesn't matter what language you're

512
00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:11,960
writing in if you can't communicate with

513
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,820
another human being and this doesn't

514
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:15,770
matter if you're a manager your employee

515
00:20:15,770 --> 00:20:17,600
if you're a single person you're like I

516
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:18,740
don't have to care about people I'm just

517
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:20,539
writing code no you have to communicate

518
00:20:20,539 --> 00:20:23,600
to your users who are people and so

519
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,970
everything that software touches is

520
00:20:25,970 --> 00:20:28,840
about people so caring is hard though

521
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:33,260
and how to care is really hard people

522
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:35,450
are basically these walking blobs that

523
00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:36,950
are just filled with emotions including

524
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:39,890
myself up here I'm actually brimming

525
00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:43,370
with emotions right now so figuring out

526
00:20:43,370 --> 00:20:45,350
how to how to deal with these emotional

527
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:49,610
sacks is really really really hard but

528
00:20:49,610 --> 00:20:51,770
guess what like everything you do and

529
00:20:51,770 --> 00:20:54,020
everything you learn like making sausage

530
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:58,250
or or writing code whatever it is

531
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:00,590
there's a books about it people have

532
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:02,270
been doing this for a long time and can

533
00:21:02,270 --> 00:21:04,429
teach you so trying to reinvent the

534
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:06,200
wheel and being like oh we're going to

535
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:08,480
try this completely new management

536
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,190
strategy that I read about an ink

537
00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:12,770
magazine cool that's great but also

538
00:21:12,770 --> 00:21:14,809
people have studied this fuels for a

539
00:21:14,809 --> 00:21:16,070
really long time and have some wisdom

540
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:18,950
maybe it's kind of some of its BS and

541
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:20,960
that's great but if you read a lot of it

542
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:23,179
and process it and form opinions about

543
00:21:23,179 --> 00:21:24,860
it then you can apply it to your own

544
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:28,010
needs so there's this really great book

545
00:21:28,010 --> 00:21:30,289
that was recommended to me once and it

546
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:33,260
sounds like everything about

547
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:35,149
that and you look at that book what are

548
00:21:35,149 --> 00:21:37,220
you what do you see you see two point oh

549
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:39,289
there's a sticker on it that sideways

550
00:21:39,289 --> 00:21:43,940
like you guys but it's a really

551
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:45,919
good book I highly recommend it forget

552
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:47,929
the two point oh it's just the revised

553
00:21:47,929 --> 00:21:49,460
edition they just wanted to make it

554
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:53,120
sound cool but emotional intelligence is

555
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,220
this other field of study so people like

556
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:58,220
think of IQ as like your intelligence

557
00:21:58,220 --> 00:22:00,500
about making rational decisions and

558
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:02,210
doing stuff like that and solving math

559
00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:04,909
problems emotional attention i call EQ

560
00:22:04,909 --> 00:22:06,260
and that's the other side of things

561
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:09,200
because people are like a complete sacks

562
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:12,500
of emotions and so doesn't matter how

563
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:14,160
smart you are what these p

564
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:16,590
gone to Harvard and done smart things

565
00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:19,650
have have figured out is that people who

566
00:22:19,650 --> 00:22:21,420
are actually emotionally intelligent and

567
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:23,850
can do these things and navigate complex

568
00:22:23,850 --> 00:22:26,310
situations and people are actually way

569
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:29,340
more successful money wise career wise

570
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:32,130
family wise than anyone who doesn't like

571
00:22:32,130 --> 00:22:33,300
you could be the smartest person in the

572
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:35,460
world but if you're a total dick you're

573
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:37,380
not you're not gonna you're not going to

574
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:40,830
succeed and Steve Jobs and you on mosque

575
00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:42,360
and all these people who are praised for

576
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:46,980
their like being a DB basically I'm

577
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:48,870
gonna lie said dick and thence into said

578
00:22:48,870 --> 00:22:53,610
DB but anyway um uh there there like

579
00:22:53,610 --> 00:22:55,980
outliers right there are there people

580
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:59,190
who who like try to buck this and but

581
00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:00,810
people like praised them and put them on

582
00:23:00,810 --> 00:23:02,430
pedestals but really we should be

583
00:23:02,430 --> 00:23:04,380
praising everyone else who's doing a

584
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:06,810
really good job and being successful so

585
00:23:06,810 --> 00:23:08,820
you basically breaks down to this I can

586
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:11,760
do like a 90 hour talking about this but

587
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:14,640
I won't but there are four quadrants and

588
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,920
mainly the basic idea is being aware of

589
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:19,200
who you are in the world and being aware

590
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,760
of the people that are around you that's

591
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:22,020
what it all breaks down to and if you

592
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:23,670
will be aware of your own emotions and

593
00:23:23,670 --> 00:23:25,590
how they affect other people and how

594
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:27,480
other people's emotions might affect you

595
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:30,270
then you're on the path to being

596
00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:32,400
successful basically so like if you're

597
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,900
in a meeting and someone shoots down

598
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:36,630
your idea and literally fire start

599
00:23:36,630 --> 00:23:39,450
shooting out of your ears you're not a

600
00:23:39,450 --> 00:23:41,040
very emotionally intelligent person

601
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,450
basically as the bottom line people

602
00:23:42,450 --> 00:23:45,650
understand that seeing that emotion

603
00:23:45,650 --> 00:23:47,880
steaming off of you and know that you're

604
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:50,730
about to flip out at them and they might

605
00:23:50,730 --> 00:23:52,830
be like oh okay or if you're walking on

606
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:54,030
an office and your boss just starts

607
00:23:54,030 --> 00:23:55,860
yelling at people that person is not

608
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:57,570
very emotionally intelligent it's not

609
00:23:57,570 --> 00:23:59,400
just about anger it's about repressing

610
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,570
feelings and everything like that Thun

611
00:24:00,570 --> 00:24:03,270
but we read this book it's really good

612
00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:05,250
you'll get a lot out of it it'll take

613
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:11,160
you about 25 minutes to read so you care

614
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:13,460
a lot you're doing this thing and then

615
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:16,440
how do you burn out well it's easy you

616
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:18,180
actually care about things when you care

617
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:20,220
about things a lot and you work really

618
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:22,890
hard you end up putting everything in

619
00:24:22,890 --> 00:24:26,370
this basket of this golden thing that's

620
00:24:26,370 --> 00:24:27,570
going to flow to the heaven

621
00:24:27,570 --> 00:24:30,870
and be the savior of all mankind and in

622
00:24:30,870 --> 00:24:34,230
fact actually when you do that you

623
00:24:34,230 --> 00:24:36,420
risked a lot and when you risked a lot

624
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:41,850
you fail sometimes and so I got to this

625
00:24:41,850 --> 00:24:45,900
place about September 2013 where I was

626
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:47,910
like oh this is not really something's

627
00:24:47,910 --> 00:24:49,740
wrong with me I'm like not sleeping very

628
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:52,530
well I I can't really focus at work so I

629
00:24:52,530 --> 00:24:54,090
was like okay well we need to like

630
00:24:54,090 --> 00:24:55,800
rearrange the whole team and I did a

631
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,420
whole team reorg and that helped a

632
00:24:57,420 --> 00:24:58,950
little bit at that point I was like

633
00:24:58,950 --> 00:25:01,350
reviewing managing like 40 people and

634
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:05,010
that was hard and so I managed a couple

635
00:25:05,010 --> 00:25:06,510
less people that helped a little bit but

636
00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:09,090
it still wasn't perfect and in January

637
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:11,250
of 2014 I was like okay I got to make a

638
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:15,270
change and so I talked to my leaders the

639
00:25:15,270 --> 00:25:16,740
other leaders of the paperless team it

640
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:18,510
was like look I gotta I gotta do

641
00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:19,770
something else is not this is not

642
00:25:19,770 --> 00:25:21,750
working anymore they were like okay well

643
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:24,060
stick around help us hire the next CTO

644
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:26,700
you'll do it and over the course of a

645
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:27,960
year and a half when I was helping out

646
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,490
in transition things just kind of got

647
00:25:29,490 --> 00:25:30,720
worse and worse to the point where I was

648
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,360
like just not happy and kind of making a

649
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:36,210
mess of things and that wasn't it

650
00:25:36,210 --> 00:25:37,800
burning out wasn't just about carrying

651
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:40,830
it was about a lot of other things so in

652
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:44,040
September 2013 I had a kid I'm not going

653
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:45,510
to go through the details of that whole

654
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:49,230
thing but here he is he was running

655
00:25:49,230 --> 00:25:50,670
around earlier around a few saw him his

656
00:25:50,670 --> 00:25:53,250
name is Magnus he's really cute that's

657
00:25:53,250 --> 00:25:55,320
him in a chef's outfit with me in my

658
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:57,210
chef's outfit and in his first halloween

659
00:25:57,210 --> 00:26:00,030
that team in our local farmers market

660
00:26:00,030 --> 00:26:02,100
he's the king of the farmers market he

661
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:03,870
literally walked up to people and asks

662
00:26:03,870 --> 00:26:05,730
for treats and give him treats at the

663
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:09,240
farmers market it's amazing um so having

664
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:11,940
kid is like this crazy thing that I

665
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:14,070
didn't I always wanted to be a dad but I

666
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:15,870
wasn't really prepared for it I think

667
00:26:15,870 --> 00:26:17,520
emotionally so she because I was working

668
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:21,000
so hard it was crazy and because having

669
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,220
a kid is a lot of work and what I don't

670
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:25,620
realize is like how not only how much

671
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:27,960
work it was going to be but how how much

672
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:30,660
I wanted to invest in that little human

673
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:33,330
being and so your mission as a parent I

674
00:26:33,330 --> 00:26:35,400
learned very quickly was you have this

675
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:38,430
human being and your job for as long as

676
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:40,570
possible is to make them believe

677
00:26:40,570 --> 00:26:42,039
the world is an awesome place right

678
00:26:42,039 --> 00:26:45,269
which is really really really hard right

679
00:26:45,269 --> 00:26:49,210
it's it's really hard because the world

680
00:26:49,210 --> 00:26:52,509
is not an awesome place oh well it can

681
00:26:52,509 --> 00:26:55,600
be it can be but for the most part it's

682
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,429
it's not socially these days it's really

683
00:26:57,429 --> 00:27:01,539
hard so I was putting you know in

684
00:27:01,539 --> 00:27:03,370
September 2013 you might notice that

685
00:27:03,370 --> 00:27:05,019
that might have a line when I started to

686
00:27:05,019 --> 00:27:07,659
burn out because I had these 40 people

687
00:27:07,659 --> 00:27:09,399
that I was managing and I kind of

688
00:27:09,399 --> 00:27:11,590
thought of them as you know my children

689
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:14,230
and then I thought of my actual child I

690
00:27:14,230 --> 00:27:15,759
was like wait I have to decide between

691
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:18,279
my children and this actual human being

692
00:27:18,279 --> 00:27:21,850
that I actually care about because I was

693
00:27:21,850 --> 00:27:25,090
a part of his birth and I am responsible

694
00:27:25,090 --> 00:27:27,220
for him for the rest of my life at least

695
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:31,539
so making that choice sucks how many

696
00:27:31,539 --> 00:27:33,070
people in this room have had to make

697
00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:34,690
that choice between their child and

698
00:27:34,690 --> 00:27:37,899
their work right I mean it's a horrible

699
00:27:37,899 --> 00:27:39,879
heart-wrenching thing and I hope all of

700
00:27:39,879 --> 00:27:42,039
you someday get a chance to do it

701
00:27:42,039 --> 00:27:43,269
because it's heart-wrenching and it's

702
00:27:43,269 --> 00:27:45,519
hard but it's also an a very important

703
00:27:45,519 --> 00:27:48,340
thing at least for me so obviously if I

704
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:49,720
wanted to make things awesome what am I

705
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:51,730
going to do so I had to completely

706
00:27:51,730 --> 00:27:54,220
rearranged my life so that they would

707
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:55,960
have a better life of me I grew up in

708
00:27:55,960 --> 00:28:00,100
Brooklyn New York Brooklyn and sorry I

709
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:02,769
had to do that and I'm legally obligated

710
00:28:02,769 --> 00:28:04,600
to do that as coming from brooklyn are

711
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:08,169
no feel free all you need that so my

712
00:28:08,169 --> 00:28:10,120
parents worked really hard and I learned

713
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:12,309
working hard from them they worked every

714
00:28:12,309 --> 00:28:14,490
hour I was raised by a nanny basically

715
00:28:14,490 --> 00:28:18,610
and I didn't see them that off in and

716
00:28:18,610 --> 00:28:21,879
now my my mom this is a picture of my

717
00:28:21,879 --> 00:28:23,110
dad and I had this new world I'm

718
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:24,460

719
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:28,570

when my wife is pregnant with my son my

722
00:28:36,909 --> 00:28:39,549
mom's favorite thing to do was to look

723
00:28:39,549 --> 00:28:42,129
at her look at me look at her look at me

724
00:28:42,129 --> 00:28:45,639
and say Aaron we did a really bad job

725
00:28:45,639 --> 00:28:50,350
with you and you know she's a Jewish mom

726
00:28:50,350 --> 00:28:52,679
she didn't intend to say it and that

727
00:28:52,679 --> 00:28:54,809
that sounds really harmful what she

728
00:28:54,809 --> 00:28:57,059
actually meant was that she wished that

729
00:28:57,059 --> 00:29:00,450
I she was able to give me the life that

730
00:29:00,450 --> 00:29:02,429
I am trying to give my son which is a

731
00:29:02,429 --> 00:29:04,230
which is when you say it that way it

732
00:29:04,230 --> 00:29:08,159
sounds much better so so we left the

733
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:09,749
city and we moved to this place called

734
00:29:09,749 --> 00:29:13,950
Kingston New York and Kingston I'm

735
00:29:13,950 --> 00:29:15,629
actually illegally obligated to say

736
00:29:15,629 --> 00:29:19,799
Kingston like that too so Kingston New

737
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:21,119
York I'm not gonna talk that much about

738
00:29:21,119 --> 00:29:23,249
it but Kingston New York is the first

739
00:29:23,249 --> 00:29:25,200
cat was the first capital of New York

740
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,149
State it's one of the oldest towns in

741
00:29:27,149 --> 00:29:30,179
America this historic reenactment

742
00:29:30,179 --> 00:29:31,769
happened a couple months ago around the

743
00:29:31,769 --> 00:29:34,019
corner from my house the best part about

744
00:29:34,019 --> 00:29:38,340
this was this a red coat leaned against

745
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:40,710
a minivan and set off a car which I

746
00:29:40,710 --> 00:29:42,110
thought was like the funniest thing ever

747
00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:44,519
but there was an actual cannon rolling

748
00:29:44,519 --> 00:29:46,320
down the street it's just celebrate the

749
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,899
his burning of Kingston my wife and I

750
00:29:48,899 --> 00:29:51,480
which happened in October 1977 sanity

751
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:55,529
and and we came up we went to Kingston

752
00:29:55,529 --> 00:29:59,460
just to visit and we saw this house and

753
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:02,970
this house is also known as a van kuren

754
00:30:02,970 --> 00:30:05,789
house it's a pretty house it's old and

755
00:30:05,789 --> 00:30:08,159
when we saw it it looked like this it

756
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:10,590
was actually basically staged like a

757
00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:13,139
museum and it was on the market it had

758
00:30:13,139 --> 00:30:14,820
been on the market for four years and

759
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:16,619
for some reason my love and I were like

760
00:30:16,619 --> 00:30:19,080
yeah this is our house and so we bought

761
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:24,330
this house it was built in 1680 and I

762
00:30:24,330 --> 00:30:28,379
the last renovation was in 1932 and

763
00:30:28,379 --> 00:30:30,690
we're the third family to own this house

764
00:30:30,690 --> 00:30:34,740
and I'm very proud of this and it's it's

765
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:37,379
cool because I could talk about this a

766
00:30:37,379 --> 00:30:39,899
lot too but most of my personal family

767
00:30:39,899 --> 00:30:42,509
history was destroyed between World War

768
00:30:42,509 --> 00:30:45,840
to you and the programs in in Russia in

769
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:48,990
it late 1900s because I'm from Jewish

770
00:30:48,990 --> 00:30:51,960
background Jews don't have a good good

771
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:53,190
you know I'm a good track record with

772
00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:59,369
history so so we all my records of where

773
00:30:59,369 --> 00:31:01,350
my family was from in Eastern Europe are

774
00:31:01,350 --> 00:31:04,049
basically destroyed so I realized that I

775
00:31:04,049 --> 00:31:05,910
could buy this house and buy a

776
00:31:05,910 --> 00:31:08,640
erica by american history i am now a

777
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:11,010
part of American history and now i have

778
00:31:11,010 --> 00:31:13,410
have this history unfortunately that

779
00:31:13,410 --> 00:31:15,240
awesome portrait didn't come with the

780
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:17,400
house they sold all the things and we

781
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:19,140
spent like eight months renovating this

782
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:20,910
house but the whole point was to have

783
00:31:20,910 --> 00:31:23,070
space and to have time so that could be

784
00:31:23,070 --> 00:31:25,500
with my son and I'm happy to say that

785
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:29,550
that that for sure has happened my wife

786
00:31:29,550 --> 00:31:31,830
hated it when he had voted in by those

787
00:31:31,830 --> 00:31:36,120
hilarious he said data I'm working and I

788
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:39,870
thought that was where so I want to talk

789
00:31:39,870 --> 00:31:41,370
about this I don't actually know the

790
00:31:41,370 --> 00:31:42,930
story I don't actually know how to do

791
00:31:42,930 --> 00:31:44,850
this except I feel like I'm on the right

792
00:31:44,850 --> 00:31:48,210
track right so the first thing is any

793
00:31:48,210 --> 00:31:50,310
career I enjoy for a child that's an

794
00:31:50,310 --> 00:31:52,020
easy thing to do right no but really

795
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:55,770
this book hey what do you know emotional

796
00:31:55,770 --> 00:31:57,690
intelligence and figuring out how to how

797
00:31:57,690 --> 00:31:59,190
to be an emotional person and how to

798
00:31:59,190 --> 00:32:00,780
share those emotions and read emotions

799
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:02,760
off of other people actually turns out

800
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:06,120
to be really interesting and proves very

801
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:08,730
valuable as a parent because being a

802
00:32:08,730 --> 00:32:10,980
parent and a manager you know there

803
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:13,080
aren't that many differences developers

804
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:14,970
kind of act like children most of the

805
00:32:14,970 --> 00:32:19,370
time and it's all about understanding

806
00:32:19,370 --> 00:32:21,870
what emotions are and when you have a

807
00:32:21,870 --> 00:32:23,940
child and a little little boy especially

808
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:26,010
I'm guessing I don't know what having a

809
00:32:26,010 --> 00:32:27,810
little girl is like he just like

810
00:32:27,810 --> 00:32:30,150
breathes emotions that's all he does

811
00:32:30,150 --> 00:32:32,100
it's like he doesn't especially when he

812
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:33,600
was young he didn't know what he didn't

813
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:34,650
know how to talk all he could do was

814
00:32:34,650 --> 00:32:37,710
like a moat at us and so learning how to

815
00:32:37,710 --> 00:32:39,600
like balance our own emotions which I'm

816
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:40,890
not saying I'm like a hundred percent

817
00:32:40,890 --> 00:32:42,810
good at this I still yell all the time

818
00:32:42,810 --> 00:32:44,700
and get angry because as you can tell

819
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:46,500
I'm very passionate and emotional person

820
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:48,510
that I wave my hands a lot and sometimes

821
00:32:48,510 --> 00:32:52,200
because I burn a pizza or because I do

822
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,970
something stupid like stubbing my toe

823
00:32:53,970 --> 00:32:56,280
which Magnus actually thinks is the most

824
00:32:56,280 --> 00:33:00,090
hilarious thing ever you know just

825
00:33:00,090 --> 00:33:02,310
learning how to adapt and understand

826
00:33:02,310 --> 00:33:03,450
other people's emotions is really

827
00:33:03,450 --> 00:33:06,780
important and teaching him and trying to

828
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:09,120
teach him what I do and trying to be

829
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:12,270
present is my goal right I'm trying as

830
00:33:12,270 --> 00:33:14,100
hard as I can to be present and that's a

831
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:15,600
really really hard in our world we're

832
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,400
surrounded by things that are trying to

833
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,290
have us be present for

834
00:33:19,290 --> 00:33:21,570
then and our devices and everything as

835
00:33:21,570 --> 00:33:23,520
opposed to the people around us it's

836
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:25,860
really really hard to be present and

837
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:28,380
this is him doing an impression of me

838
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:30,720
literally like he's like I'm working

839
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,780
just like death and he goes like this

840
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:35,700
and that's probably what I look like and

841
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:38,370
sometimes actually i have videos i

842
00:33:38,370 --> 00:33:39,570
should have put it he's going like he's

843
00:33:39,570 --> 00:33:42,990
like fat that but there's nothing on the

844
00:33:42,990 --> 00:33:46,290
screen it's completely off but he knows

845
00:33:46,290 --> 00:33:47,490
that that's what it looks like when dad

846
00:33:47,490 --> 00:33:52,170
is working um anyway so but moving away

847
00:33:52,170 --> 00:33:56,160
actually hurt some things too I have I

848
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:57,510
had some really good friends in New York

849
00:33:57,510 --> 00:33:59,450
I had some people that I loved and

850
00:33:59,450 --> 00:34:01,860
especially this this guy named Mike

851
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:04,560
Bernstein who's like my my best friend

852
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:06,390
and we would see each other almost every

853
00:34:06,390 --> 00:34:07,800
week when we were in New York we worked

854
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:09,419
together for a couple years and it was

855
00:34:09,419 --> 00:34:11,070
really hard to be away he actually moved

856
00:34:11,070 --> 00:34:12,990
to DC to so were neither of us are in

857
00:34:12,990 --> 00:34:14,310
Brooklyn so we couldn't figure out how

858
00:34:14,310 --> 00:34:17,520
are we going to like be the same friends

859
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:19,650
and we came up with a solution which was

860
00:34:19,650 --> 00:34:21,929
making a podcast this is the stupidest

861
00:34:21,929 --> 00:34:23,910
solution to this problem ever but it

862
00:34:23,910 --> 00:34:26,070
worked it's called beats Ryan types

863
00:34:26,070 --> 00:34:28,919
we've done 40 episodes now and it's

864
00:34:28,919 --> 00:34:31,650
about music food and programming when

865
00:34:31,650 --> 00:34:33,750
it's the beats Ryan types and those are

866
00:34:33,750 --> 00:34:35,850
our three interests and it was basically

867
00:34:35,850 --> 00:34:38,190
just a gag for us to be able to talk at

868
00:34:38,190 --> 00:34:40,230
least once a week for an hour and it's

869
00:34:40,230 --> 00:34:41,460
turned to something that other people

870
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:44,190
actually like which is cool I don't know

871
00:34:44,190 --> 00:34:48,030
why I guess where were we Diggle so much

872
00:34:48,030 --> 00:34:50,460
that it's contagious i think is the idea

873
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:53,610
so out of that came the pizza book a

874
00:34:53,610 --> 00:34:55,350
piece of books i was talking about

875
00:34:55,350 --> 00:34:56,910
before is a project of beats right

876
00:34:56,910 --> 00:34:58,620
intentions the two of us wanting to do

877
00:34:58,620 --> 00:35:00,180
more things together we realized that

878
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:04,980
that the podcast was good but why can't

879
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:07,470
we just only work with each other and do

880
00:35:07,470 --> 00:35:08,790
awesome things and do things that we

881
00:35:08,790 --> 00:35:10,080
actually care about we're both

882
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:12,960
programmers we both like do programming

883
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:15,120
things are consulting or whatever it is

884
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:17,720
I do these days but we realize that

885
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:20,460
we're actually passionate as you can

886
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:23,250
tell about other things and so we wanted

887
00:35:23,250 --> 00:35:26,370
to we wanted to share that passion and

888
00:35:26,370 --> 00:35:28,740
the same thing this collaboration this

889
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:31,530
work with this other person it's about

890
00:35:31,530 --> 00:35:32,880
people that's all

891
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,859
is but the pizza book is great it's a

892
00:35:34,859 --> 00:35:39,059
great forum for this energy but all it

893
00:35:39,059 --> 00:35:42,660
is is us wanting to be human beings

894
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:46,349
together and so out of that I got really

895
00:35:46,349 --> 00:35:47,880
excited I was like how do i do more

896
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:50,069
human being things and I was like okay

897
00:35:50,069 --> 00:35:51,839
I'm in the catskills I'm in this

898
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:53,730
beautiful place how do I want to run a

899
00:35:53,730 --> 00:35:54,960
conference and I met some awesome people

900
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:57,150
who also had this idea to run a tech

901
00:35:57,150 --> 00:35:58,170
conference in the middle of the woods

902
00:35:58,170 --> 00:36:00,359
and so we got together and we did it and

903
00:36:00,359 --> 00:36:01,950
how do you run a conference where it's

904
00:36:01,950 --> 00:36:04,349
easy you just think what would Chris and

905
00:36:04,349 --> 00:36:06,599
Laura Williams do and that's basically

906
00:36:06,599 --> 00:36:08,609
how we did it we were like okay well

907
00:36:08,609 --> 00:36:10,289
there should be booze there should be

908
00:36:10,289 --> 00:36:12,059
music there should be non-alcoholic

909
00:36:12,059 --> 00:36:13,380
drinks there should be really good food

910
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:15,960
there should be dancing if possible

911
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:18,029
whatever we can throw and crammed into

912
00:36:18,029 --> 00:36:19,950
this weekend let's do it so we ran this

913
00:36:19,950 --> 00:36:21,720
thing called Catskills humph it was in

914
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:24,750
October John re6 poke at it so we're

915
00:36:24,750 --> 00:36:28,799
going to be successful and so but it was

916
00:36:28,799 --> 00:36:30,930
awesome it was like we got this group of

917
00:36:30,930 --> 00:36:34,319
like about 120 people together to forage

918
00:36:34,319 --> 00:36:36,750
to do blacksmithing to make do you make

919
00:36:36,750 --> 00:36:38,339
book binding to listen to some awesome

920
00:36:38,339 --> 00:36:40,470
talks we got everyone to square dance

921
00:36:40,470 --> 00:36:42,769
which is a pretty amazing feat I think

922
00:36:42,769 --> 00:36:45,029
and we tried to run this thing without

923
00:36:45,029 --> 00:36:48,630
any pretension just shove people into

924
00:36:48,630 --> 00:36:50,819
the woods into this beautiful nature and

925
00:36:50,819 --> 00:36:53,039
get them excited about the world around

926
00:36:53,039 --> 00:36:55,529
and then the people around them and out

927
00:36:55,529 --> 00:36:56,990
of this one I realize is that

928
00:36:56,990 --> 00:36:59,549
collaboration in itself and working with

929
00:36:59,549 --> 00:37:02,279
other people is actually a medium for

930
00:37:02,279 --> 00:37:05,009
creativity like not the thing you create

931
00:37:05,009 --> 00:37:07,049
but working with other people is a way

932
00:37:07,049 --> 00:37:09,480
of being creative and that got me really

933
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:11,609
excited and how do you work with other

934
00:37:11,609 --> 00:37:13,170
people how do you make it so that you

935
00:37:13,170 --> 00:37:15,480
can how do you maximize the amount of

936
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:18,210
time that you can be creative and

937
00:37:18,210 --> 00:37:20,160
collaborate because programming is

938
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:22,829
creative but it's also like it's created

939
00:37:22,829 --> 00:37:24,210
in a certain way it's inherently

940
00:37:24,210 --> 00:37:26,490
creative but in order to actually make

941
00:37:26,490 --> 00:37:28,410
it truly creative you have to work a lot

942
00:37:28,410 --> 00:37:30,089
at it and same thing with anything you

943
00:37:30,089 --> 00:37:34,289
do I think so my mission right now which

944
00:37:34,289 --> 00:37:37,410
I don't necessarily have the answer for

945
00:37:37,410 --> 00:37:39,750
is how do you do the least amount of

946
00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:41,880
things to make enough money to do all

947
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:45,660
the things you want and this I kind of

948
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:46,740
circumnavigated

949
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:48,360
site via and came back around to it

950
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:50,040
through my whole life because I never

951
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:52,110
really wanted to work 90 hours a week

952
00:37:52,110 --> 00:37:54,960
but I really thought that that that was

953
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,490
going to land me in a position where I

954
00:37:56,490 --> 00:37:58,110
would have enough money to do all the

955
00:37:58,110 --> 00:37:59,790
things that I want turns out that

956
00:37:59,790 --> 00:38:02,190
they're easier way is to get to that end

957
00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:04,530
result like you don't have to work a

958
00:38:04,530 --> 00:38:06,390
hundred hours a week to make exactly

959
00:38:06,390 --> 00:38:08,100
enough money you want to do the things

960
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:10,320
you want maybe you work 20 hours a week

961
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:12,150
maybe you work 100 hours a week so many

962
00:38:12,150 --> 00:38:15,540
weeks and not other weeks and obviously

963
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:17,190
I'm in a very lucky position to this and

964
00:38:17,190 --> 00:38:18,720
I can't just say everyone just go out

965
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:21,360
and quit your jobs but all I'm saying is

966
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:23,640
to think about your choices when you're

967
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:26,040
going into this because the idea of a

968
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:28,170
start-up and the idea of this golden egg

969
00:38:28,170 --> 00:38:30,780
at the end of this thing most of the

970
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:33,960
time it's not there it's just not and so

971
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:37,110
maximizing the amount of time you can

972
00:38:37,110 --> 00:38:38,760
spend and doing the things that you

973
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:41,460
actually care about now instead of 60

974
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:43,800
years from now when you retire or

975
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:46,290
whatever it is like that's actually

976
00:38:46,290 --> 00:38:47,700
probably what you want to be doing and

977
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:49,860
so that's been my focus is try to solve

978
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:51,450
this problem and I don't have the

979
00:38:51,450 --> 00:38:53,640
solution i'm sorry but i know that if

980
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:56,010
you focus on the trajectory how you're

981
00:38:56,010 --> 00:38:58,290
getting there as opposed to the money

982
00:38:58,290 --> 00:38:59,790
the pile of money that you're going to

983
00:38:59,790 --> 00:39:04,170
Scrooge McDuck into that that you can

984
00:39:04,170 --> 00:39:06,180
actually do the things you want maybe

985
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:07,560
it's not a pile maybe it's just a

986
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:09,300
dusting of cash that you can kick around

987
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:11,520
with your feet and that's enough to get

988
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:14,670
you through the week you know maybe

989
00:39:14,670 --> 00:39:17,460
that's all you need um and so my final

990
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:21,840
thoughts is that you can learn how to do

991
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:24,869
anything like I want everyone to walk

992
00:39:24,869 --> 00:39:26,690
away with this feeling this like I

993
00:39:26,690 --> 00:39:29,040
didn't know anything about making

994
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:31,140
sausage or bacon ten years ago and yeah

995
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:32,400
maybe that's not the hardest thing it's

996
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,320
not building a rocket but I bet if I

997
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:35,730
worked really hard maybe I can build a

998
00:39:35,730 --> 00:39:39,210
rocket don't call me on that but there's

999
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:40,980
a lot of books out there about building

1000
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:42,450
rockets right I'm sure I can figure it

1001
00:39:42,450 --> 00:39:44,850
out but there's a lot of stuff so please

1002
00:39:44,850 --> 00:39:46,430
you can learn how to do anything and

1003
00:39:46,430 --> 00:39:51,710
finally these things find awesome people

1004
00:39:51,710 --> 00:39:54,750
to do things with make things you

1005
00:39:54,750 --> 00:39:57,840
actually love and just everything

1006
00:39:57,840 --> 00:40:00,270
else because they don't matter right if

1007
00:40:00,270 --> 00:40:00,750
you

1008
00:40:00,750 --> 00:40:03,200
who can focus on these things and do it

1009
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:05,970
you'll you'll be happy or maybe you will

1010
00:40:05,970 --> 00:40:07,530
hopefully you'll be happy i think i'm

1011
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:09,810
focusing on this i'm trying and i think

1012
00:40:09,810 --> 00:40:13,200
i'm about 10x happier than i was in jazz

1013
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:15,540
comp 2012 when I was kind of moping

1014
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:17,220
around the pool kicking rocks like

1015
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:21,810
 peanuts so i think i can tell

1016
00:40:21,810 --> 00:40:24,570
peanuts so i think i can tell
you honestly that if you try and you

1017
00:40:24,570 --> 00:40:26,610
make things that are awesome and you use

1018
00:40:26,610 --> 00:40:29,070
the inherent creativity that is in all

1019
00:40:29,070 --> 00:40:31,590
of you and focus that energy into a beam

1020
00:40:31,590 --> 00:40:33,960
and shoot at something that something

1021
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:36,770
will be awesome so thanks i'm erin quinn

1022
00:40:36,770 --> 00:40:46,240
