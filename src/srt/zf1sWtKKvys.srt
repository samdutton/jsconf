1
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:08,880

so we're presenting our

2
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,580
nest mg is as you can see it's about

3
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:12,870
remix in old school games with

4
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:15,870
JavaScript so go ahead okay alright so

5
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:17,850
first before we start on that she won't

6
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:19,980
tell you little bit about us we have a

7
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:21,810
common interest in like tinkering with

8
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:24,390
old machines we met through kind of a

9
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:25,680
hacker scene in New York that does

10
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,660
chiptune music made using video game

11
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:29,419
systems all computer stuff like that and

12
00:00:29,419 --> 00:00:32,160
you know kind of like hit it off in a

13
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:36,360
way so as friends so we both have dealt

14
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:37,860
into like some nest development before

15
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,350
like home brew which is making her own

16
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:42,780
nes software I've done some hacking on

17
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:45,030
emulators and stuff like that and andrew

18
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:46,920
has done a lot of hardware stuff he's

19
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,510
going to talk a little bit about and

20
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:50,130
specifically this the system here which

21
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:53,970
is a dual port ram for the nes so so I'm

22
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:55,320
an electrical engineer by trade so I

23
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,570
mostly do circuit design and the NES

24
00:00:57,570 --> 00:00:58,860
stuffs been hobby programming for a

25
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:01,620
while and so a lot of stuff I end up

26
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:05,549
doing for for fun ends up being around

27
00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:07,439
these old consoles like super interested

28
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:08,939
in computer architecture if you go back

29
00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:10,110
and you look at these systems they're

30
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:13,350
really clever so here's board for the

31
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:15,329
NES they're just flash carts you can

32
00:01:15,329 --> 00:01:18,539
reprogram with your own software this is

33
00:01:18,539 --> 00:01:20,039
the assembly line that's like that photo

34
00:01:20,039 --> 00:01:22,950
this is a game actually Dustin worked on

35
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:24,810
eated all the programming and I just did

36
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:26,759
the hardware piece so typically I'm more

37
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:31,130
in you know embedded or like FPGA type

38
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:34,499
programming but when you work with these

39
00:01:34,499 --> 00:01:36,149
old systems you need to be so close to

40
00:01:36,149 --> 00:01:38,609
them like so conscious of what you're

41
00:01:38,609 --> 00:01:39,929
doing that it's actually kind of a

42
00:01:39,929 --> 00:01:41,579
rewarding experience to make something

43
00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:45,149
run and this is just a Sega one so this

44
00:01:45,149 --> 00:01:47,429
is a Genesis cartridge again you put

45
00:01:47,429 --> 00:01:48,749
your own software on just like a little

46
00:01:48,749 --> 00:01:51,450
dock you can flash over USB so this dual

47
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:55,560
port Ram mod was one of the pieces that

48
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:58,619
I worked on and then Dustin implemented

49
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:01,679
the software for it so yeah so first

50
00:02:01,679 --> 00:02:03,119
just talk a little bit about what the

51
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:05,249
nes is a lot of you'll probably heard of

52
00:02:05,249 --> 00:02:07,139
it but isn't in case so is a game

53
00:02:07,139 --> 00:02:09,630
console released in 85 it was extremely

54
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:11,700
popular in the in the united states it

55
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,020
couldn't just blew up and revitalize

56
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:15,240
video games the important part here is

57
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,830
that it's extremely weak by today's

58
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:20,040
standards a pat CPU you make you do the

59
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,660
stats there and the key part is we only

60
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:22,470
have

61
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:23,970
a little more than two thousand bytes of

62
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:29,700
RAM so not a lot to operate too good so

63
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:32,670
Ness ma'am is a way that we can access

64
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:35,370
the ram in the NES while it's running we

65
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:36,770
can read it and we can write to it

66
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:38,910
manipulate it and basically kind of act

67
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:42,210
as a coprocessor in a way the the sort

68
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:44,250
of things you can do with it are almost

69
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:46,350
to your imaginations limit you can do

70
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:48,870
really insane cheat codes with it just

71
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:51,600
kind of types of experiments you know

72
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,220
like like weird things you just kind of

73
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:55,800
have fun with and it works both in

74
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,390
software and in hardware which we'll

75
00:02:57,390 --> 00:03:00,140
talk a little bit more later in the talk

76
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:01,950
so yeah so that some of the things that

77
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:05,459
were inspired and that we were inspired

78
00:03:05,459 --> 00:03:08,220
by angie was previous work with the dual

79
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:11,060
port ram was using python as a front-end

80
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:14,160
rendered graphics that way there's an

81
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:17,190
emulator called fce UX it's the most

82
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:18,990
featured emulator I guess you could say

83
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:22,440
for the NES it's a technically

84
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,540
cross-platform but in Windows it has

85
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:27,000
more features it has a scripting engine

86
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,610
in Lua which allows you to do similar

87
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:31,709
things to this where you can modify

88
00:03:31,709 --> 00:03:33,420
graphics modify memory things like that

89
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:35,160
yes and we are really interesting

90
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:37,230
developer features is why we kind of

91
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:39,450
flock to it yeah out of a really cool

92
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:40,950
stuff you can do and that kind of you

93
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:42,780
know this definitely inspired forward

94
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:44,130
you have a hex editor you kind of look

95
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:45,450
at the ram while it's running but we

96
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:46,980
wanted to bring it to hardware right and

97
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:49,530
an accessory called the game genie was

98
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:51,420
was around back there in the NES that

99
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:54,900
allowed you to modify memory addresses

100
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,850
in the system but it was like you to do

101
00:03:56,850 --> 00:03:58,170
it beforehand and it's kind of hard to

102
00:03:58,170 --> 00:03:59,549
use it was a little weird and awkward

103
00:03:59,549 --> 00:04:01,799
and you put a game cartridge into the

104
00:04:01,799 --> 00:04:03,660
game training game shooting into the

105
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:06,420
system yeah you your one friend in grade

106
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:07,560
school that you might have actually

107
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,090
liked maybe had a game genie and you

108
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:10,110
would hang out with him just so you can

109
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:13,380
use it okay so just going to give you an

110
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:14,489
idea of what you can do with this we're

111
00:04:14,489 --> 00:04:17,130
gonna do a quick demo okay so mm yeah

112
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:18,359
can we switch one of these screens to

113
00:04:18,359 --> 00:04:27,300
the nes oh wow cool live demos yeah okay

114
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:31,410
so I thought that might happen so right

115
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:33,630
now we have the on the back of the

116
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:36,000
console there's an additional port here

117
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,530
and it's just a you are took a serial

118
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:40,560
port and we're reading it over and we'll

119
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,820
go over the background but right now

120
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:43,950
this is feeding live through USB to this

121
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,930
machine and Dustin will go over the

122
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:48,750
architecture but on things that annoyed

123
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:50,490
me most about this game is that you

124
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:52,160
can't see the score while you're playing

125
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:58,710
so this is a live representation of the

126
00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:02,970
score and the so come yeah out of the

127
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:05,190
score and period they just scored yeah

128
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:07,410
great so actually you really can't see

129
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:09,180
it until you score so like sometimes its

130
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:10,830
neck and neck and you forget on a really

131
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:11,970
high scoring do you mean my cousin got

132
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:15,660
really competitive to put this so yeah

133
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:17,310
maybe let it run until you know the

134
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:19,349
timer updates live yeah and that's

135
00:05:19,349 --> 00:05:21,150
reading from brand like real time just

136
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:23,490
funneling tons of bytes over the that

137
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:25,080
stream right yes not stimulated by like

138
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,039
counting down or something like that

139
00:05:26,039 --> 00:05:27,870
it's coming yet it's raw it's actually

140
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:30,330
frame four separate decimal coded bites

141
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:35,250
so yeah and then TSA kind of manhandled

142
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:37,020
by bag and broke some my hardware but I

143
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:39,360
guess that's what I get it's okay i have

144
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,270
a video of it running but it was was

145
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:46,030
pretty much all for this

146
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:51,790
so we played this game a lot and the

147
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:56,060
yeah but completely lost his mind they

148
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:58,280
had seen it so we were just looking for

149
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,830
I was just looking for ways to

150
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:02,960
non-intrusive Lee extend a game that I

151
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:03,980
already liked without calling like a

152
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:06,230
hack or like disassembling it or reverse

153
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:07,490
engineering it I really want to just

154
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:09,230
take the information that's kind of

155
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:10,970
hidden to you and get like this third

156
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:12,950
eye into all the stuff that's going on

157
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:14,720
and then you could extend it however you

158
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,730
like there's like millions idea every

159
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:19,100
time I mean it's probably how this both

160
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:20,570
started with Dustin we talked about like

161
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:22,160
oh but what about this what about double

162
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,440
dragon what about you know we go you

163
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:26,090
know through all these ideas of stuff

164
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:28,190
you wish we could have done you know

165
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:30,500
game genie just wasn't enough I wasn't

166
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:33,500
enough so a quick overview of what

167
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:36,350
exactly we're working with here dismiss

168
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:39,680
cool so this is a diagram showing the

169
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,660
layout of the address space of the NES a

170
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:43,640
pet machine but it has a 16-bit address

171
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,890
which is why you see for hex bytes there

172
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:49,100
it's text on the left and the way the

173
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:50,930
memory works is the first eight pages

174
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:53,450
which is the two thousand bytes that's

175
00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:54,470
the ram so that's the part that we're

176
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:57,110
targeting below that you have addresses

177
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:58,520
that when you read and write to control

178
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:01,280
the input devices the graphics the sound

179
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,260
below that certain cartridges have were

180
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:04,370
crammed we're not going to really touch

181
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:06,350
on that here but you don't just so you

182
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:07,880
know it's there and then below that is

183
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,890
where the game rom is so the stuff that

184
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:12,140
specific to each cartridge the the

185
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:16,100
graphics and sort of the the code the

186
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:18,650
levels the music sound effects all the

187
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:20,150
data for the game is in is in the rom

188
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:21,470
down there so again can't touch that

189
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:24,550
we're just living on the top there so

190
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:28,130
okay so Ness them the the system that we

191
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:30,440
have kind of looks like this on the left

192
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:32,360
you have a script you write for each

193
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,340
game and the idea is that they're very

194
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:36,830
convenient to make their simple you can

195
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:39,020
iterate really quickly with them in the

196
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:40,780
middle on top there you see the engine

197
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:44,750
all JavaScript stuff that kind of you

198
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:45,620
know middle where is it all together

199
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:47,720
does a bunch of magic if a web server

200
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,960
that handles the graphics on the bottom

201
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:52,190
client browser attaches and that's where

202
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:53,840
you get things like that scoreboard all

203
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,590
rendered in the client

204
00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:57,060
browser running you know browse your

205
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:00,000
style JavaScript the right is the kind

206
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,620
of the flexible part where you could

207
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:03,990
have different backends one of them is

208
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:05,970
the serial port for talking to the dual

209
00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:07,890
port Graham right here and that's what

210
00:08:07,890 --> 00:08:09,660
we make it work on real hardware but you

211
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:11,850
can switch that out for the emulator

212
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:13,200
version so that you can run it on

213
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,850
software and your computer instead and

214
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:16,320
then there's things for like you know we

215
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:18,270
did testing Arduino it to make sure that

216
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:20,850
the protocol was good and then things

217
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:22,890
like mock backends for testing or if you

218
00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:24,990
don't need a pack n for whatever reason

219
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:26,550
which actually does come into play yeah

220
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:29,640
oh yeah so here's an example script it's

221
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:32,490
a little hard to read but you can kind

222
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:36,210
of see the shape of it so this game

223
00:08:36,210 --> 00:08:37,590
ninja gaiden you're like a ninja wearing

224
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:38,820
a blue outfit running down the street

225
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:41,750
like tackling people and dogs and stuff

226
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:45,060
this does a very simple mod to it where

227
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:47,030
it always sets you to have four lives

228
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:49,200
whenever you hit the B button to attack

229
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,060
you get full health and when you press

230
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:53,540
down it fills up your ninja magic nympho

231
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:56,100
so the way that it's defined you see on

232
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:58,770
top there is a field called memory map

233
00:08:58,770 --> 00:09:01,740
within that you have to define variables

234
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:03,390
for certain memory addresses and you

235
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:05,730
have to know those I have the time so

236
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:07,280
there's a little bit of detective work

237
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,900
however you want to do it in there but

238
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:12,510
those define where those variables live

239
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:14,790
in the ne SS memory so i think that's

240
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:16,320
seven six months i should know this by

241
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,570
now 76 on top for the number of lives

242
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:20,580
you have when you assign that basically

243
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:22,710
now you have a variable called lives

244
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:25,490
that will represent that value in RAM

245
00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:27,390
and then below that you have a couple of

246
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:28,890
methods just plain old JavaScript I can

247
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:30,180
do whatever you want on the JavaScript

248
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:34,440
side the the variables that you use in

249
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,900
the memory map are using data binding so

250
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:40,110
they're set every frame before you run

251
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:41,400
and then if you modify them they get

252
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,260
written back into the RAM so it's a

253
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:45,000
super easy interface you don't have to

254
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,200
worry about what's actually in the back

255
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,450
end whether it's real hardware or

256
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:50,610
emulator it just does the right thing

257
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:53,010
and then at the bottom you know kind of

258
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:54,450
just hook it all into the engine and

259
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:56,940
that makes it happen buttons are also

260
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:58,920
handled specially because we want to

261
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:00,060
know when certain buttons get pressed

262
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:02,700
the the engine will read in the the

263
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:04,290
buttons value from from Ram that you

264
00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:07,170
also assign the address to and then the

265
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:07,710
engine

266
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:09,750
well calculate differences that it knows

267
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:11,040
when new buttons get pressed when funds

268
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:15,570
get released things like that yeah okay

269
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:17,100
and you're going to talk about how the

270
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:18,300
hardware works okay am I trying to go

271
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:21,570
through this quick think we're ready so

272
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:23,820
okay this is the the board that actually

273
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:26,430
installed in the NES it's just the bare

274
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:28,560
PCB but you can see it's it the

275
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:29,580
architecture is pretty straightforward

276
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:32,070
it's a microcontroller that's about

277
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:34,260
talking to keep saying dual-port ram and

278
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:35,940
what it is is it's static RAM and

279
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:37,950
instead of having one set of address

280
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:39,450
lines and data lines you actually have

281
00:10:39,450 --> 00:10:42,210
two and they both can speak they both

282
00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:44,970
can speak at the same time and there's

283
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:47,880
internal arbitration logic on the chip

284
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,680
and it'll handle what rights and what

285
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:52,740
has precedence and everything so this is

286
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:55,230
it actually installed on any NES so what

287
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:56,880
I did is I pulled the RAM chip the

288
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:00,630
little dip chip out there and then I put

289
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:02,460
my board where it was and then one port

290
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:04,170
maps directly the IDS so nothing's

291
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:06,300
hooked up like if that second ship

292
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:08,850
wasn't here the microcontroller would

293
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:10,800
still operate normally so there's no

294
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,330
interference but now we can read and

295
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:13,470
write it while it's running with no

296
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:15,840
interference at all this microcontroller

297
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:19,230
feeds to I'm act like a reset line and

298
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:22,980
and also the nmi which is like an

299
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:25,230
interrupt thing the 60 Hertz time for

300
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:27,270
that keeps games running yeah so I map

301
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:30,420
those for more debugging features taking

302
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:34,920
feedback sorry okay and uh okay just say

303
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:37,470
I've tried put together a quick system

304
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:42,780
diagram and the port a here this is

305
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:45,000
running to the microcontroller so let's

306
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,170
say this is the thing that's to reading

307
00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:47,580
writing and doing on manipulating and

308
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:48,660
then the other one is running to the

309
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:50,280
Naas so it's acting normally what's

310
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:52,260
going on and then reset the nmi there

311
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:56,280
and that won't translate onto there so

312
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:58,340
this you get to see this but this is the

313
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:00,600
yeah right there and it looks like a

314
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,670
headphone jack it's just like geeky part

315
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:04,350
I liked on digikey which is just so you

316
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:05,730
are what the headphone jack i mean i

317
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:09,780
honestly i have that i'll try to go

318
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:13,200
through this quick 04 yeah so i'm gonna

319
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,140
run a couple demos and show you some of

320
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:17,340
the stuff i like to do with this thing

321
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:26,379
i'll go through make man 3 really cool

322
00:12:26,389 --> 00:12:31,050
great cool so what we're looking at it's

323
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:32,670
actually a live dump of the memory

324
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:35,339
values as we go along and restless yeah

325
00:12:35,339 --> 00:12:37,529
load up and it can we get an NES on one

326
00:12:37,529 --> 00:12:40,470
of the screens somebody's gonna lose is

327
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:46,560
really far spall text okay so he's gonna

328
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:47,910
be playing the game and what I can

329
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:49,319
actually do is you probably can't see it

330
00:12:49,319 --> 00:12:51,569
much from there actually can you hook up

331
00:12:51,569 --> 00:12:58,410
the audio to the TV yep probably I don't

332
00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:00,329
think I have any more cables about this

333
00:13:00,329 --> 00:13:04,110
guy must know this is going into the

334
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:05,579
thing down there okay we're at a cable

335
00:13:05,579 --> 00:13:08,220
skip over this one no that's coming out

336
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:10,889
of it oh yeah we're not yeah thanks so

337
00:13:10,889 --> 00:13:12,990
we actually looking at a live memory so

338
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:14,759
it's actually funny you get kind of an

339
00:13:14,759 --> 00:13:16,050
intuition as you kind of mess with this

340
00:13:16,050 --> 00:13:17,670
thing so like you'll play and you back

341
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:19,139
okay where the lives and you'll you'll

342
00:13:19,139 --> 00:13:23,610
stay right now there's more it uses less

343
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:25,560
intensive to use like the first paid 20

344
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,060
page because you use one less bite for

345
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:28,680
the address so you're looking here like

346
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,509
all the vital stuff is in here like his

347
00:13:30,509 --> 00:13:32,399
ex and is why where he lives there and

348
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:34,920
like you know what level you're on and

349
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,600
things that get access your life for

350
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:40,110
instance so once you get this going

351
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:41,970
hopefully I'll use the audio part and

352
00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:44,040
then I'll plug it right to the TV oh yes

353
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:46,259
I just get some audio so you'll be like

354
00:13:46,259 --> 00:13:47,399
okay let me do something and then you

355
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:49,050
like walk left and right and then you're

356
00:13:49,050 --> 00:13:50,189
like okay that's decrementing it's

357
00:13:50,189 --> 00:13:51,329
incrementing sticker make it right and

358
00:13:51,329 --> 00:13:52,319
then you know where it is and then you

359
00:13:52,319 --> 00:13:54,269
could lock certain value so I wrote down

360
00:13:54,269 --> 00:13:56,069
yeah some before how can you turn that

361
00:13:56,069 --> 00:13:59,320
up I don't know mean

362
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:02,020
so like the sound engine uses a lot of

363
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:05,440
bites you know so there's like a you

364
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,490
know all these weird effects these four

365
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:07,690
Bravo things so it kind of hard to pull

366
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:10,270
off so like I said you get kind of an

367
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:20,889
intuition for it see find this here

368
00:14:20,899 --> 00:14:23,160
so this is the sound and you can see

369
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:25,160
it's kind of syncing up with the music

370
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:27,210
and I can start messing with it live

371
00:14:27,210 --> 00:14:30,810
well whoa that was this will get out the

372
00:14:30,810 --> 00:14:41,160
restart that I demos so I see ya just

373
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:51,540
play the game and uh so he'd be really

374
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:52,890
cruel like I'm just hitting d to

375
00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:56,190
decrement his life as we go down yummy

376
00:14:56,190 --> 00:14:58,920
so like I could just well so now I

377
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:02,700
underflow now he's at 255 but a lot that

378
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:05,010
nice then I put on a sine wave if I'm

379
00:15:05,010 --> 00:15:06,660
just having a sign table lookup so you

380
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:08,459
can like link that to like his ex ER is

381
00:15:08,459 --> 00:15:13,649
why ok I hit the music engine that's not

382
00:15:13,649 --> 00:15:18,879
right

383
00:15:18,889 --> 00:15:22,309
there we go and I don't want to spend

384
00:15:22,309 --> 00:15:23,949
too much time here but i actually have i

385
00:15:23,949 --> 00:15:26,929
told you i was i'm on the line it's an

386
00:15:26,929 --> 00:15:29,420
open collector for to do the interrupt

387
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:32,119
so I could actually frame step the game

388
00:15:32,119 --> 00:15:33,859
by holding it down the ground and like

389
00:15:33,859 --> 00:15:36,529
pulling it low so i'm actually telling

390
00:15:36,529 --> 00:15:37,790
the thing not to use the interrupt

391
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:39,379
anymore just keep it grounded don't let

392
00:15:39,379 --> 00:15:42,919
it do anything else so it's i'm stepping

393
00:15:42,919 --> 00:15:48,410
well you might turn that down and then I

394
00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:54,470
let him go so so for debugging that's

395
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:55,639
great so like I'm playing a game I'm

396
00:15:55,639 --> 00:15:56,959
like you know if you were trying to

397
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:59,509
derive say like Mega Man's jump game you

398
00:15:59,509 --> 00:16:00,949
know jump gravity for your game you

399
00:16:00,949 --> 00:16:02,209
could frame step and see how many pixels

400
00:16:02,209 --> 00:16:03,529
he moves one by one and they actually

401
00:16:03,529 --> 00:16:04,850
watched the ramp as he goes you can see

402
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:06,709
is Delta Y it's the old stuff but you

403
00:16:06,709 --> 00:16:08,359
know that's really interesting and my

404
00:16:08,359 --> 00:16:11,540
favorite and I'll do a quick a while the

405
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:13,579
music went to hell gee just Lich's a

406
00:16:13,579 --> 00:16:21,230
random address a random value so let's

407
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:27,199
go it's a died because that's gear that

408
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:29,779
wouldn't lock yeah actually punch out

409
00:16:29,779 --> 00:16:34,610
really quick

410
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:39,910
thanks but so I have this thing where i

411
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:42,160
tortured my housemate and I make him

412
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,840
play megaman 1 and every time he jumps

413
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,070
it'll glitch a random address and the

414
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:46,420
game just descends into madness as it

415
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:50,500
goes so get this back up and but the

416
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:51,910
other really interesting thing is I use

417
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:53,110
this as a debugging tool so i'll write

418
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:54,640
to a known ram location and look at it

419
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:57,670
and helps me reverse engineer games but

420
00:16:57,670 --> 00:16:59,140
then sometimes you'll hit like a ram

421
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:00,550
addressing me like whoa that already any

422
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:01,960
SME they're both oh yeah k goes from 1

423
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:06,160
nes sorry you'll watch stuff happening

424
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:10,660
like wow that's that's cool i'll be like

425
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:12,100
whoa what was that for like this one's

426
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:20,890
my favorite lee so this is not a game

427
00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:22,959
genie code it's not something really i

428
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:24,820
couldn't find anything about it right so

429
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:26,290
it's actually the this right drawing

430
00:17:26,290 --> 00:17:27,970
routine it's a how tall the

431
00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:29,320
characteristics and goes to swing he

432
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:31,210
kind of like sometimes his vertical go

433
00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:33,090
up but you know you go the other way too

434
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:35,110
but like you already feel bad enough for

435
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:37,030
this jump right and then now you yes sir

436
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:48,560
so and you know there's a real quick I

437
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:55,690
feel bad for so he sucks but i canna it

438
00:17:55,690 --> 00:17:57,910
totally give some help back right at a

439
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:59,350
time you can you can mess with the thing

440
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:00,730
live and it's been really with a lot of

441
00:18:00,730 --> 00:18:04,930
fun play with well okay so i want to

442
00:18:04,930 --> 00:18:06,820
move on i don't want to forget this time

443
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:08,440
too much we have actually an interactive

444
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:11,640
demo really excited about this okay okay

445
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:15,340
okay okay so mm for the other half the

446
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:17,220
equation the emulator implementation

447
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:20,170
there is a software package expound call

448
00:18:20,170 --> 00:18:23,800
JX court it's it's kind of a version of

449
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:26,500
nodejs that focused on bedding volvo

450
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,390
stuff like that and in particular you

451
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:29,860
can make a dll put it into some

452
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:32,080
application and you have a no chance

453
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:35,530
runtime so speaking about FCU x before

454
00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:37,960
the emulator basically i did similar to

455
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:41,110
what the lua that'd interpreter is doing

456
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:44,140
but with javascript instead so that

457
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:45,160
allows us to have the back end that

458
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:45,760
works

459
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,620
the code you write once you know we'll

460
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:48,940
just work depending on which back-end

461
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:50,620
you choose when you start up our system

462
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:52,270
you can check out some of the source

463
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:54,370
there funny story it actually had a bug

464
00:18:54,370 --> 00:18:55,750
were didn't run in windows applications

465
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:58,360
that thankfully was enjoy to figure out

466
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:01,030
and fixed so it all worked so yeah the

467
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:02,470
the key reason why we use JavaScript

468
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:04,780
instead of the previous languages that

469
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:07,480
were used python for for Andrews old

470
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:10,150
system and lua for the nes emulator is

471
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:12,670
that we could do it in both uh you know

472
00:19:12,670 --> 00:19:15,880
we can embed it we can do hardware

473
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:19,450
manipulation excuse me and writing

474
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:20,500
scripts once you know everything works

475
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:23,950
and you have like a web interface for

476
00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:25,890
free so some of the problems we ran into

477
00:19:25,890 --> 00:19:29,140
there's some slowness in serial port ran

478
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:31,300
into that gave us some performance

479
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:33,640
problems never got around to figuring it

480
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:36,240
out might be OS X specific because

481
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,620
Andrews code and windows was working

482
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:40,180
okay that was my son there's a lot of

483
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:42,000
variables that we we couldn't nail down

484
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,260
there are custom drivers were using on

485
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:46,540
the mac that helped a little bit and

486
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:48,640
then the emulator version was was kind

487
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,020
of tricky until I realized oh yeah

488
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:52,120
threats do the right thing in this case

489
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:53,560
it won't slow down the emulator to a

490
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:56,320
halt and then utf-8 is always a pain but

491
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:59,980
ok more demo time yeah how are you that

492
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:02,710
works me now you gonna oh you gotta do

493
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:06,520
that one instead alright so how are we

494
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:13,629
on time okay

495
00:20:13,639 --> 00:20:15,760
a little bit

496
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:18,430
alright sir this up should just do one

497
00:20:18,430 --> 00:20:21,910
demo and then sorry that's why okay all

498
00:20:21,910 --> 00:20:26,470
right quick oh sorry as anyone here

499
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:30,160
really get a counter who is you guys

500
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:32,980
gotta fight over it oh you're the plug

501
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:48,970
me in ya USB cool I need a victim suck

502
00:20:48,970 --> 00:20:56,510
it out okay

503
00:20:56,510 --> 00:21:03,870
alright so I know right huh 1984 1985

504
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:07,850
young video out oh yeah you can't tell

505
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:10,580
once again object right hmm yeah Oh

506
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:11,900
what's not full screen yet so you should

507
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:16,040
be able to see it live demos there's a

508
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:17,810
lot of moving parts yes it's tricky we

509
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:19,550
want to show at you all good yeah so I'm

510
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:22,460
getting up with their this move there no

511
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:26,780
this is the wrong one you put its

512
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:29,230
audience all right we'll do something

513
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:37,110
then so here it's a stampin here huh

514
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:41,840
there that work cool perfect alright so

515
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,100
we have a video mixer here like in key

516
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:44,780
I'll black so we were talking about

517
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:49,070
automatic games that was easy so give me

518
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:55,050
a swing across and get the favor here

519
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:57,620
alright we unplug the audio okay anyway

520
00:21:57,620 --> 00:22:00,740
ha yes what you back I went through the

521
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:04,730
foot yeah and then down key so the

522
00:22:04,730 --> 00:22:06,950
Tickells castlevania your vampire slayer

523
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:10,360
sirens all menthe and the game has these

524
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:12,950
right there yeah all right it has these

525
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:14,390
candles I contain items would you

526
00:22:14,390 --> 00:22:16,670
normally can't see what's in the candle

527
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:18,980
so what this script does it reads the

528
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:21,770
memory of like the candle objects

529
00:22:21,770 --> 00:22:23,420
figures out what's inside each one and

530
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:26,000
then like you know calculates their

531
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,080
position and draws it over on top so

532
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:32,390
it's it's nice to help with like you

533
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:33,710
have a certain item and you don't want

534
00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:37,490
to get a bad one so you know like if the

535
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:39,200
the kennels safe to hit or not the ones

536
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,340
that don't have anything or actually

537
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:42,050
random value so there's there's no way

538
00:22:42,050 --> 00:22:43,640
to figure that out given the fact that

539
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:45,680
we're only working with Ram not with the

540
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:47,420
program code you know we only have so

541
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:49,580
much visibility and there's only so much

542
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:50,720
you can do to like reverse engineer a

543
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,700
game and you know start enhancing it

544
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:55,310
like this but uh yeah you can see like

545
00:22:55,310 --> 00:22:56,720
you know there's definitely gonna be

546
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,490
holy water in that one actually not in

547
00:22:58,490 --> 00:23:01,820
this case I already have it but yeah

548
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:06,050
this one gives a big heart so yeah kind

549
00:23:06,050 --> 00:23:07,390
of that idea

550
00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:11,150
next we probably won't have time ok

551
00:23:11,150 --> 00:23:13,220
that's what yeah we want to get a few

552
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:14,810
there but we'll we'll post and we're

553
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:16,610
going to follow right so yeah um things

554
00:23:16,610 --> 00:23:18,650
in the future we want to do it would be

555
00:23:18,650 --> 00:23:21,140
nice to have like an stl port for no Jas

556
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:22,490
so we can do local graphics without

557
00:23:22,490 --> 00:23:23,780
having to go through a browser like this

558
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:25,670
the browser option is really nice

559
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:27,080
because you can do cool things with the

560
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:30,950
web hint hint but it's sometimes is a

561
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:32,810
little awkward and you know you could

562
00:23:32,810 --> 00:23:34,610
make like snap you're more responsive

563
00:23:34,610 --> 00:23:37,610
real-time stuff with with like SQL rain

564
00:23:37,610 --> 00:23:40,160
the same process she'll report process

565
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,570
problems will be nice to figure out

566
00:23:41,570 --> 00:23:43,670
bearing down on that at 3am last night

567
00:23:43,670 --> 00:23:45,920
yeah and our reporting is kind of weak

568
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,390
right now like things go wrong and you

569
00:23:47,390 --> 00:23:48,770
know something went wrong but not really

570
00:23:48,770 --> 00:23:51,410
why yeah so some of the applications for

571
00:23:51,410 --> 00:23:53,180
this things you can do that are cool

572
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:55,850
with it aside from just demos different

573
00:23:55,850 --> 00:23:57,380
ways of having having neat input for

574
00:23:57,380 --> 00:24:00,170
games so what was the idea you had well

575
00:24:00,170 --> 00:24:01,910
I'm saying you can use anything like any

576
00:24:01,910 --> 00:24:03,320
input you different computer you can

577
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:04,490
translate to what you said a really good

578
00:24:04,490 --> 00:24:06,080
one before you remember no worries young

579
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:09,080
here we go sorry from talk there's like

580
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:10,310
the speedrunning community where people

581
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:12,410
play old games and they plan real

582
00:24:12,410 --> 00:24:14,270
hardware in order to verify there's no

583
00:24:14,270 --> 00:24:16,760
like interference with other processes

584
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:19,510
running in an emulators host machine and

585
00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:21,500
as a result you know they want to be

586
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:22,880
like like really precise to like the

587
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:25,040
original games stick but yet when they

588
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:26,480
do timings for it you know it's like

589
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,370
second level precision you know they

590
00:24:28,370 --> 00:24:30,530
know it's like oh you were half a second

591
00:24:30,530 --> 00:24:32,420
faster maybe they down to 16

592
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:33,530
milliseconds you can get down to the

593
00:24:33,530 --> 00:24:35,060
frame and you actually know exactly when

594
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:36,410
the boss died the frame you just look at

595
00:24:36,410 --> 00:24:37,640
the ram of his health so this is gonna

596
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:39,650
give you later monistic right there you

597
00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:41,990
go all right um yeah and also you could

598
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:43,610
do like you know web-enabled nes games

599
00:24:43,610 --> 00:24:44,540
or something when I talks like that

600
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:47,030
would be okay sorry how much do we can

601
00:24:47,030 --> 00:24:48,710
do audience participation you guys wanna

602
00:24:48,710 --> 00:24:50,750
try this yeah so I when I was down in

603
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:53,060
Austin I met this brilliant designer

604
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:56,630
Zach Johnson who did he works with node

605
00:24:56,630 --> 00:24:58,070
and he does a lot JavaScript like mi

606
00:24:58,070 --> 00:24:59,510
Mouse stuff that was really cool he did

607
00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:00,890
like a massive multiplayer joust that

608
00:25:00,890 --> 00:25:03,200
like it's like oh so I met him and I was

609
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,700
like an idea to do this thing where

610
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:06,440
people would interact with the NES and

611
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,550
he whipped something together in like

612
00:25:07,550 --> 00:25:10,040
four hours so we only got to run that

613
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:11,510
demo down there like 10 people so I

614
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:12,950
really want to run it for the second

615
00:25:12,950 --> 00:25:14,630

thanks so much yeah we don't want to

656
00:28:47,690 --> 00:28:49,879
keep too much time but you get the idea

657
00:28:49,879 --> 00:28:51,950
this is an idea we had for a while we're

658
00:28:51,950 --> 00:28:54,229
usually you you have an audience like

659
00:28:54,229 --> 00:28:55,549
this who can basically affect what's

660
00:28:55,549 --> 00:28:58,099
going on using all real hardware and

661
00:28:58,099 --> 00:29:01,519
this mod yep and then uh till we screw

662
00:29:01,519 --> 00:29:02,809
up with the person who's flying so it's

663
00:29:02,809 --> 00:29:05,779
somewhat interactive that's it going

664
00:29:05,779 --> 00:29:11,089
anyway well no good what was that I get

665
00:29:11,089 --> 00:29:12,440
the point I have to be a lot of time

666
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:21,520
okay this'll anyway sorry yeah

667
00:29:21,530 --> 00:29:23,670
they put this together in like four

668
00:29:23,670 --> 00:29:25,500
hours or something he's nuts so did you

669
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:27,000
I can check out his site I should put it

670
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,940
back up he does a lot of interesting

671
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:33,960
node stuff there we go Zach Johnson yeah
