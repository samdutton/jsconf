00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:33,860
Hello, everyone, so my name is Brenna, I'm
from Toronto in Canada and I'm a front-end engineer

2
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:39,360
at tent. But before that I actually taught
at a Front‑End development boot camp for

3
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:45,670
a year. I want to tell you a little story
about something that happened there that came

4
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:51,830
to be known as the "oprah circle" so the very
first time we ran this boot camp everything

5
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:57,850
was sort of experiment, we were feeling it
out as we went along and we kind of followed

6
00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:03,110
the normal course you would started out with
a couple weeks over HTML and CSS followed

7
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:09,390
by a few weeks of JavaScript and then something
happened in the weeks immediately following

8
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:15,830
JavaScript, there was a weird tension hanging
over the entire classroom. We got this feeling

9
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:20,500
that we had like defeated people. And so we
decided that we needed to do something, we

10
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:27,430
staged an intervention of sorts. We gathered
all of our 27 or so students in a circle,

11
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:32,179
and we asked them all to share a highlight
of the course so far, followed by a low light

12
00:01:32,179 --> 00:01:36,830
and then another highlight. So the low lights
ranged from things you would expect like:

13
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:42,229
I don't get to see my friends and family as
much, I have a long commute. Halve of my students

14
00:01:42,229 --> 00:01:49,759
gave me a one word answer "javaScript" JavaScript
was a low light for them, this broke my heart

15
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:55,950
the JavaScript community is personally where
I have felt like the most inspired, the most

16
00:01:55,950 --> 00:02:00,009
supported, the most welcome in my own journey
as a Front‑End developers and I wanted to

17
00:02:00,009 --> 00:02:04,619
know why aren't these people new to the is
industry feeling the love, why haven't they

18
00:02:04,619 --> 00:02:10,679
seen the good parts of the community. If you
think about it, this isn't that surprising,

19
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:16,220
learning to code is a hard challenging thing
to do, there are barriers involved. Today

20
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:20,900
I want to talk about those barriers, some
of them are technical, some of them are cultural,

21
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:24,190
and I want to talk about the solutions to
help overcome them for the newest members

22
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:32,080
of our community. One thing that I think is
really critical to remember is that many newcomers

23
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:38,159
to JavaScript are new to the world of programming
in a lot of ways. This happens really frequently

24
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:44,040
and increasingly because the demand for JavaScript
developers is so high and we have a hugh influx

25
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:48,480
of people that are coming in from non‑traditional
backgrounds and looking maybe formal computer

26
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:54,180
science training. I think many of us sort
of build up our JavaScript knowledge like

27
00:02:54,180 --> 00:03:00,430
this. We're able to get the job done and like
ship something out, but in essence we're looking

28
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:06,769
a solid foundation beneath that. One great
strategy for dealing with this is just to

29
00:03:06,769 --> 00:03:10,969
read a book that covers these fundamental
topics, there are a ton of them available

30
00:03:10,969 --> 00:03:15,730
on‑line for free. So whether this be for
yourself our to recommend to somebody who's

31
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:20,140
kind of struggling building those foundations
this is a good resource, eloquent JavaScript

32
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:25,530
in particular, a lot of people said they've
had good success with that. And when you're

33
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:31,450
looking these foundations it fundamentally
comes down to communication problem. How often

34
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:37,180
do we tell people oh, you have a problem in
your code? Just Google it. And while it's

35
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:42,019
true that most of the answers are out there
somewhere in the internet, how can somebody

36
00:03:42,019 --> 00:03:47,719
formulate an intelligent question and find
their way there if they don't use the correct

37
00:03:47,719 --> 00:03:53,969
terminology, if they don't speak the language.
So, this I found was happening with a lot

38
00:03:53,969 --> 00:03:57,810
of my students, we just weren't seeing eye
to eye as far as talking about the concepts

39
00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:06,010
that we were trying to debug, I used a little
technique I call hooked on syntax. So, something

40
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:12,469
like this, pretty simple line of code. Maybe
if you are, you know, reasonably profish innocent

41
00:04:12,469 --> 00:04:16,209
JavaScript, you can read that and sort of
parse out what it does immediately in your

42
00:04:16,209 --> 00:04:22,990
head. But for a beginner, you have to interpret
all this. That's a lot that you're doing implicitly.

43
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:28,930
I literally would sit with students and say
let's sound this out word by word. Var, what

44
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:34,260
is that, that's a key word that exists in
JavaScript and it says hey, I'm going to go

45
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:40,340
create a variable. Max number, what is that?
And you know, I know that that's something

46
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:44,520
that I made up, I got to name that, but that's
not something that's always clear to a beginner,

47
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:51,120
so you really have to be patient with people
as they're going through things like this.

48
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:55,720
And this is actually like a tough thing for
me to do as a teacher, like I struggle to

49
00:04:55,720 --> 00:05:01,650
be patient. It's so tempting when the someone
has a problem, hear's the answer I'll give

50
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:06,650
it to you, but they're never going to learn
like that. One thing that infuriates me the

51
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:11,900
most when I see a more experience developer
(infuriates) come over to someone's computer

52
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:17,729
and literally take over and type on it. You
need to let that person, as painstaking as

53
00:05:17,729 --> 00:05:22,919
it might be, type things out really slowly
for themselves and actually learn and internalize

54
00:05:22,919 --> 00:05:29,360
and make their own mistakes. And returning
to this idea of keeping track of a lot of

55
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:35,900
language and syntax and terminology, we really
need to remember that this is not a test.

56
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:40,800
We're brought up with this culture of memorization,
all throughout like most of our traditional

57
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:45,990
schooling, we learn something and then we're
tested on it and usually we just have to memorize

58
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:51,800
the thing that we're being tested on this
is not in any way like a typical programmers

59
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:57,889
work flow. Personally, I have the syntax for
something like a four memorized because I've

60
00:05:57,889 --> 00:06:04,660
written it thousands of times, but I never
Satoshi there with flash cards and memorized

61
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:10,759
for a 404 loop is, for some reason people
that are entering don't get that, they feel

62
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:15,580
a pressure that they have to memorize it.
I want you to tell people it's okay to look

63
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:20,490
it up. There's no shame in looking something
up that you don't know (Memorize it) let's

64
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:24,990
provide them with resources to do this. This
is just like a quick cheat sheet I through

65
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:30,229
together for some of my students. I could
tell that they were just overwhelmed with

66
00:06:30,229 --> 00:06:36,800
all of this and it really helped to have that
security blanket there, so share these resources

67
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:46,060
with people or create them yourself. Another
challenge for a lot of beginners is specially,

68
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:51,520
especially for people coming in from HTML
and CSS, that has a lot of immediate feedback

69
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:59,229
and visual output. So JavaScript can be really
dry and abstract and boring. One thing, I

70
00:06:59,229 --> 00:07:03,550
think we need to to do is stop using Foo and
bar, extremely achieving tract things in our

71
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:11,520
example, use something with context that actually
means something to someone. You know, if I

72
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:16,220
see black and Orange, I understand that those
are both colors and they're related and helps

73
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:23,270
me grasp the con sect that an array is a collection
of related items. The thing with this too

74
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:32,370
is it's also memorable. So, who recognizes
this? It's a closing brace. Closing parenthesis

75
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:37,550
and a semi colon. It's a familiar pattern
that we see at the end of a lot of call back

76
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:44,039
functions and if you're experienced you recognize
this. To a beginner you miss one piece of

77
00:07:44,039 --> 00:07:51,259
punctuation and everything stops. And you
see syntax error on‑line 24, and which one

78
00:07:51,259 --> 00:07:59,349
of these is missing. Who knows. How do you
get someone to build the memory for that signature,

79
00:07:59,349 --> 00:08:04,530
recognize this and know that this is the correct
way to to it. You give it a silly nickname.

80
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:09,169
If you ask any one of the hundred or so people
that taught JavaScript to last year, they

81
00:08:09,169 --> 00:08:21,500
will all immediately tell you this is the
frownny winky neck beard. (Laughing) (Frownywinkyneckbeard)

82
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:30,949
similarly, dollar signs parens came to be
know Q query activate! Because when you have

83
00:08:30,949 --> 00:08:35,010
something and you want to be able to use J
query methods on it, you need to activate

84
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:41,630
the J query by swadelling it in dollar signs
and parens. The moral is to have fun with

85
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:46,310
it. I think you're an incredibly fun bunch
of people when I meet you in person, why not

86
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:52,120
bring that liveliness in our on‑line examples
and make ourselves more memorable to beginners

87
00:08:52,120 --> 00:09:01,690
(Liveliness) so, time for another problem.
If you've got your fundamentals down you know

88
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:07,920
the mechanics of how things work. A ton of
people really struggle with tackling a larger

89
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:14,340
problem. They say where do I start? It's sort
of libelerring to use a saw and a hammer and

90
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:18,590
a tape measure individually. And then all
of a sudden someone says build me a bookcase.

91
00:09:18,590 --> 00:09:24,030
Where do I start with that? And I think this
is actually where a lot of online tutorials

92
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:29,750
miss the mark they teach you the mechanics,
they don't teach you the art of problem solving.

93
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:35,480
That's a skill, once you're an experienced
developer you gain. So, I think we need to

94
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:39,770
teach people to think like a computer. Try
and get them to break town a complex problem

95
00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:44,510
into dis\h‑‑ break down a complex problem
into discreet steps you want to get them writing

96
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:51,080
pseudo code. You're giving them little baby
portions to chew off one piece at a time that

97
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:56,880
they can match up with their Toolkit a little
easier. And I think we can do stuff in our

98
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:02,020
community to facilitate that and give people
an environment where they can take on those

99
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:07,900
bigger problems and have support through working
through the stages. This is a picture from

100
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:11,790
note school Toronto T school is a\h‑‑
note school is a fantastic organization in

101
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:17,880
tons over cities easy to start a chapter if
there isn't one where you live. Anyone is

102
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:24,120
welcome to come and work through a tutorial
or hack on their own projects and it's completely

103
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:29,090
casual and informal but there's support there.
There's experienced developers, there's peers

104
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:34,810
to help them through that and sort of learn,
you know, that more difficult art of actually

105
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:40,750
working through real world problems that you're
solving with JavaScript. What this comes down

106
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:45,820
to in essence even though a lot of these are
more technical strategies, is this is about

107
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:50,070
being welcoming to newcomers, just really
taking them under your wing and helping them

108
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:54,440
get oriented in what is kind of a strange
new world if you've never seen JavaScript

109
00:10:54,440 --> 00:11:01,670
before. So, let's assume our foundation is
built, we know how to use all our tools and

110
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:12,230
when to use them. You're eventually going
to come up against this. it's so great that

111
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:16,580
a lot of us have passion about JavaScript
and how to write it, but with all these strong

112
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:22,410
opinions flying around this is what it feels
like. People get totally concerned about what's

113
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:28,250
the right way to do it? I've seen it so bad
20 the point (People get totally) people are

114
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:34,840
scared to write town any code because they're
afraid to do it the wrong way. Now part of

115
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:42,870
this is JavaScript itself. Our lovely little
language has so many instances where there

116
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:48,650
are literally multiple ways to accomplish
the same task. This happens on a macro scale

117
00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:53,830
as well. I think it's incredibly healthy that
we have a rich ecosystem of frameworks and

118
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:58,820
tooling this can get extremely overwhelming
when you're faced with all the choices and

119
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:06,270
you're not sure which one you should be using.
Beyond this it's really not helpful when we're

120
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:17,520
constanthly critiquing penal for using last
year's model. We need to let go the idea of

121
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:23,130
there being one true way to do something.
Encourage beginners to pick a method, pick

122
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:28,920
a framework and give it a try. If you don't
like it or if it doesn't work for you, then

123
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:34,300
try something new. You know. If it gets the
job done, in my opinion, that's the right

124
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:39,860
choice. Let people learn for themselves what
the maybe the pitfalls of using something

125
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:48,990
is on their own let them learn their lessons,
we think we have done a good job with this

126
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:54,100
paradox of choice is through things like code
style guides and best practices, people are

127
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:58,930
really looking for guidance here. I heard
this answer over and over and over again that

128
00:12:58,930 --> 00:13:05,200
I just don't know which thing to do. So, give
them guidance. These are great tools to use

129
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:09,840
either if you're learning on your own, someone
comes at you with an opinion, no, I did it

130
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:17,270
with this way because the AirBnB Java guide
said so, shut that down. Also if you're leading

131
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:22,070
a team where you're managing a bunch of junior
developers, implement something like this

132
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:27,020
so you can stop people arguing on your team
and get people to writing JavaScript together

133
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:35,910
as a team. If you're outside of these formal
places where it's allowed to set the one true

134
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:43,940
way, we all need to bite our damn tongues.
This probably happened to a lot of other people

135
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:51,650
in audience, you post a piece of code on‑line,
all of a sudden, you have like opinions flying

136
00:13:51,650 --> 00:13:59,310
at you about oh, you should do it this way
instead, have be you considered that in imstead,

137
00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:03,450
why not say something like can I give you
a suggestion instead of just flying at someone

138
00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:09,180
with the way that you think it's supposed
to be done. If you start a conversation like

139
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:13,850
this, you're going to just like open up a
dialogue where you can talk constructively

140
00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:20,880
about maybe the benefits and draw backs of
different options without it being so hostile.

141
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:26,870
And when you are giving help to someone, b
writing a Blog post, GitHub issues stockover

142
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:32,290
flow answer, I think we need to chose our
words really wisely. There's a great Blog

143
00:14:32,290 --> 00:14:37,510
post by Chris Coyier about words to avoid
in Eckcational writing. Educational writing

144
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:46,790
is anything Blog post stackover flow. If you
use words like obviously, just, simply, you're

145
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:52,580
implying that the task is easy. But the audience
are beginners, it's nota city for them, by

146
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:58,060
using these words you've completely trivialize
their struggle. And if you take the words

147
00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:05,740
out of the sentence, it reads exactly the
same way any way. Just don't do it. What this

148
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:13,300
is empathy really. You need to try and remember
what it was like when you were learning, and

149
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:17,110
there's psychology there that the further
you get from your beginner stage the more

150
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:22,010
expert you become it's actually just harder
to remember what it was like when you were

151
00:15:22,010 --> 00:15:26,500
a beginner, but I urge you all to just try
before you answer someone who's in a more

152
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:31,910
junior position, take a second and try to
see their perspective of where they're coming

153
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:39,630
from. This also applies with documentation.
As a rather famous quote from Kathy Sierra,

154
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:47,750
if you want them to RTFM, make a better FM.
I literally do not think I've ever heard someone

155
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:54,750
complain about documentation being too easy
to understand so why not just make it accessible

156
00:15:54,750 --> 00:16:00,040
to everybody. I know it's not everybody's
favorite task, but it is so, so critical there's

157
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:06,140
resources to help you write the docks that
can help you with this. All of this is the

158
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:11,930
idea of being supportive instead of just critiquing.
We quantity to be offering up resources and

159
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:20,280
encouragement. And so I also think we knead
to just like to out of our way to be encouraging

160
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:31,420
to other people. (Laughing) (Need) want to
take that in a couple more times. You know,

161
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:36,140
I think in general humans are faster to offer
up' negative opinion than a positive one.

162
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:41,080
We tend to hold that back. So just be encouraging
whether that's in the form of like a high

163
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:45,580
five when someone's debugging something and
they get it to work, celebrate the is small

164
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:48,880
wins, tell somebody if you think they did
something great. I'm sure they would love

165
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:56,300
to hear it. And sometimes that also means
just giving somebody a gentle nudge. Pushing

166
00:16:56,300 --> 00:17:03,630
them outside of their comfort zone. There
are so many people that have done this to

167
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:08,089
me when I thought, no, I can't talk at a conference,
I don't have anything to say, I don't have

168
00:17:08,089 --> 00:17:12,809
anything anyone wants to hear, I think Brian
summed this up really well this morning. But,

169
00:17:12,809 --> 00:17:19,750
yeah, try and push people out of their comfort
zone and encourage them to take leaps. Okay,

170
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:30,250
so, one more big thing I think I need to address.
A lot of people feel like this. As they continue

171
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:35,009
in their journey they've learned a lot of
foundations, they've maybe like been able

172
00:17:35,009 --> 00:17:39,830
to deal with the negative opinions coming
in, but the more you see the industry, I think

173
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:46,389
for a lot of people they start to feel leek
they don't quite fit in here. So, sometimes

174
00:17:46,389 --> 00:17:51,539
it's literally I don't look like you. I don't
look like a developer, but even regardless

175
00:17:51,539 --> 00:17:57,279
of that, I think all of us have been fed this
false narrative that in order to be successful

176
00:17:57,279 --> 00:18:05,419
as a developer, as a JavaScripter. You need
to devote your entire life to code. You're

177
00:18:05,419 --> 00:18:09,330
not allowed to have outside hobbies, you'll
never get ahead if you're not coding every

178
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:18,620
single night. I think this is entirely false.
One of my students went through the boot camp,

179
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:26,789
I became friends with her, she got a job with
a well known agency. On the books she was

180
00:18:26,789 --> 00:18:34,690
successful as a web developer. Personally
she confided in me she was thinking of quitting.

181
00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:40,269
She said I'd like to make something with my
hands, I want to maybe just go into woodworking

182
00:18:40,269 --> 00:18:46,909
and do that instead. Instead. To her it was
a binary option. She couldn't be a JavaScript

183
00:18:46,909 --> 00:18:53,629
developer and do something like this on the
side. And I said, no, no, no, wait it's okay.

184
00:18:53,629 --> 00:19:01,149
I know developers who are carpenters. Anyone
know will more key, he still does it ton side,

185
00:19:01,149 --> 00:19:06,009
he's done great talks about how that influences
his JavaScript work. There are developers

186
00:19:06,009 --> 00:19:13,440
who are in to perfectly clear ice. (Laughing)
and how do I know this? I know this because

187
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:18,950
they freely volunteer that information on
Twitter publically (Laughing) but I think

188
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:24,830
that's great. I think\h‑‑ we should all
just not be shy about who we rein our lives

189
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:30,110
outside of JavaScript and share your lovely
unique selves, because I fundamentally believe

190
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:45,090
teach and every one of you is totally awesome.
Yeah. Clap for yourselves. (Applause) by having

191
00:19:45,090 --> 00:19:51,110
unique interests, and knowledge from outside
JavaScript or computer science we all bring

192
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:55,090
something incredibly unique to the table.
And I think we're better off as an industry

193
00:19:55,090 --> 00:20:00,210
for it. Diverse people are going to look at
things in different ways and solve diverse

194
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:06,389
problems. And where I think the magic really
happens is when we take our interests and

195
00:20:06,389 --> 00:20:11,970
hobbies and combine them with JavaScript to
make truly inspiring things that appeal to

196
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:19,570
a much wider audience. General for example
loves art, loves pixel art, so she does that

197
00:20:19,570 --> 00:20:27,200
on‑line, she makes a lot of art with JavaScript.
I'm also incredibly inspired by our determination

198
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:34,870
to use JavaScript outside the browser. Node
happened not to long ago we decided hey, we're

199
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:40,919
stuck with JavaScript, I think it's sort of
started where all of us were stuck with JavaScript

200
00:20:40,919 --> 00:20:43,919
because it's the only thing that runs in the
browser and then this school thing happened

201
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:48,659
where we're like we're just going to put it
elsewhere and run with it. So we got node

202
00:20:48,659 --> 00:20:53,700
with JavaScript on the server. And then we
got Nodebots with JavaScript running on our

203
00:20:53,700 --> 00:21:00,509
Arduino boards and people like Sandra mesh
always been into suing since a kid now she

204
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:08,159
makes wearables that are controlled by JavaScript.
And this idea of JavaScript all the things

205
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:14,730
just keeps growing and growing. I never imagined
that I'd see JavaScript on a nitting machine,

206
00:21:14,730 --> 00:21:26,350
but Mariko did this. Hopefully you all saw
her talk reject JS. All of these people I

207
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:31,710
just showed you and so, so many others that
I don't have time to mention have inspired

208
00:21:31,710 --> 00:21:38,299
me to stick with JavaScript rather than any
other language. They've inspired me to continue

209
00:21:38,299 --> 00:21:43,360
learning when I felt like I knew nothing to
work on interesting side projects in my spare

210
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:49,149
time when I didn't have the motivation. That's
why I'm standing here talking to you today.

211
00:21:49,149 --> 00:21:54,990
Me, and I think so many other people in this
room just really finally felt I have a place

212
00:21:54,990 --> 00:22:03,480
where I belong. So to me, those are the good
parts. We're welcoming in terms of helping

213
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:10,370
people build a solid foundation and building
communities. We're supportive when we reserve

214
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:16,970
judgement and offerer encouragement instead.
And we're inspiring by just being cool awesome

215
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:23,100
people and making really interesting things
with JavaScript all over. But not everybody

216
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:27,789
knows this yet. Not everyone has had a chance
to come to a conference like this and see

217
00:22:27,789 --> 00:22:34,159
the good parts. So my call, to all of you,
is to take whatever you see as the good parts
