1
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:11,099

uh my name is jet Schmidt I'm Schmidt

2
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:13,349
I've one of you it's cool we can friends

3
00:00:13,349 --> 00:00:17,550
um and I i gave a talk here last year

4
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:20,130
had an awesome time and and so I want to

5
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:21,720
come back and talk again but this time

6
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:24,269
it's gonna be a little less brain and a

7
00:00:24,269 --> 00:00:27,660
little more heart I guess I'm gonna

8
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:30,390
really to you guys basically the only

9
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:33,450
way the only way that I know how through

10
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:40,440
HTTP headers so uh I'm okay you know not

11
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,059
maybe not as tall as most of you but I

12
00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:43,800
came here from Tokyo which is actually

13
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:49,789
where I live and enjoy ramen a lot I

14
00:00:49,789 --> 00:00:52,140
don't quite understand all these headers

15
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:55,949
so I'm just gonna go fly right through

16
00:00:55,949 --> 00:00:59,039
that but do you have any HTTP you guys

17
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:00,719
want to talk to me out I'd really yeah

18
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:04,320
so but i'm generally friendly but for a

19
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:06,659
living I actually don't program my

20
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:09,470
translate japanese and so for me

21
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:12,119
programming is a hobby and i love

22
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:14,490
programming in JavaScript so we're gonna

23
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:17,909
talk a little bit about that um also

24
00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:20,100
love jas confi you this is a great great

25
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:22,070
time seriously line it up line it up

26
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:40,200
organizers possible crowd food excellent

27
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,780
food as some of the best eggs I don't

28
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:44,100
think I've had in a long time yesterday

29
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:50,399
um awesome venue

30
00:01:50,409 --> 00:01:52,600
and really all the sponsors that made it

31
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:57,740
possible seriously thanks to those guys

32
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:59,920
one here that's actually near and dear

33
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,020
to my heart is actually google because

34
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:04,420
i'm staying here in Prenzlauer Berg

35
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:05,679
right down the street from their

36
00:02:05,679 --> 00:02:08,890
headquarters it's like a total

37
00:02:08,890 --> 00:02:12,760
coincidence um no I'm just kidding I

38
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:15,220
know that Google Huff is not the google

39
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:16,810
headquarters I know that it is a German

40
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:19,420
pastime

41
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:21,660
it's cool let's go we won't judge you

42
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:24,150
let's go um but we're gonna talk about

43
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:27,120
golf uh and so if anyone here plays golf

44
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,069
you might be familiar with these rules

45
00:02:29,069 --> 00:02:31,980
uh what's the point of golf well it's

46
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:33,840
pretty simple well the fewer strokes

47
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,450
wings okay and so today we're going to

48
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:38,010
talk about code golf which is very

49
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:39,090
similar except it's the fewest

50
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:43,620
keystrokes um and so specifically here's

51
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:45,239
how everything started in terms of

52
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:48,150
keystrokes um Thomas Fuchs a friend of

53
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:49,920
mine too did this thing hey little

54
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,330
helper is a tweet sighs JavaScript

55
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:52,980
templating engine and I saw the code

56
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:54,870
there you can see at the bottom and I

57
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:57,840
was like well that's cool but dude it's

58
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,340
like kind of bloated right i mean you

59
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:02,130
could totally hacked like it but carry

60
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:06,230
the one like like nine bites out of that

61
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:09,870
and so that's that's that's the

62
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:10,980
beginning of the end right there and

63
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:12,630
that's when I started code golfing so

64
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:14,819
this back in May and so that was the

65
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:18,299
birth of 140 bites um and so basically

66
00:03:18,299 --> 00:03:20,489
it is a tweet sighs fork to play

67
00:03:20,489 --> 00:03:22,170
community curated collection of

68
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:23,970
JavaScript tweet sighs and that every

69
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:25,769
piece of code has a fin to tweet this

70
00:03:25,769 --> 00:03:27,660
via 140 bites I know tweets are 140

71
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:29,700
characters is 140 bites purists only

72
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:31,500
asking for it to play and then all you

73
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:34,950
do is show up at github on our master

74
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:36,780
just fork it enter the code that you

75
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:39,390
think is cool and then we will all

76
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:41,310
curate it through comments and golf the

77
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:42,930
code down as small as we can and so we

78
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:44,100
end up with this collection of

79
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:45,420
javascript is pretty cool and we have a

80
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:48,019
site that showcases it we have now

81
00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:49,769
hundreds of entries which is kind of

82
00:03:49,769 --> 00:03:51,090
cool and i'll show you a few of those

83
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:52,950
today but basically how this all started

84
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:54,720
in terms of the history of javascript

85
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,160
code golf i think it started with a 10k

86
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,900
apart contest where you had to build an

87
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:02,160
entire web working web app in 10 K which

88
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:05,730
after seeing the next level of that

89
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:08,970
jayus 1k looks 10k looks quaint I mean

90
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:10,530
that 10 came foods they give you jquery

91
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:14,430
for free which is like weight and so so

92
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:16,500
Jase 1k was a fantastic contest in like

93
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,120
oh I learned so much about JavaScript

94
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,079
from not only

95
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:21,250
from you know from peter van der Zee

96
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:22,750
organizing it but from all these awesome

97
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:25,659
entries in it and so we thought well

98
00:04:25,659 --> 00:04:28,870
okay let's take it down another notch so

99
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:30,219
that at least we can have all of these

100
00:04:30,219 --> 00:04:34,300
significant powers represented and i'm

101
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:35,710
pretty sure that we're not gonna be

102
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:39,430
undercut because it's really hard to

103
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:43,479
golf 10 bytes of code because you can't

104
00:04:43,479 --> 00:04:46,090
even declare function so I think we're

105
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:49,629
safe so basically here are the rules it

106
00:04:49,629 --> 00:04:51,009
has to be a valid JavaScript session

107
00:04:51,009 --> 00:04:53,919
okay it can't be more than 140 bytes

108
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:56,740
which looks like this so after a

109
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:58,750
function boilerplate you have 128 left

110
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:01,990
okay and the point is to maximize

111
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:03,819
utility and minimize waste the point is

112
00:05:03,819 --> 00:05:05,830
not the smallest code possible the point

113
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:08,139
is to pack as much punch as you possibly

114
00:05:08,139 --> 00:05:11,169
can into 140 bites okay so if you go

115
00:05:11,169 --> 00:05:15,610
bang per byte hmm you know kind of

116
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:17,409
climbs then it peaks and it kind of

117
00:05:17,409 --> 00:05:19,599
falls and so right at that peak is a

118
00:05:19,599 --> 00:05:23,349
hundred forty bytes so um that's what

119
00:05:23,349 --> 00:05:24,460
we're looking for if you go slightly

120
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:26,680
over its cool right but the whole point

121
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,690
is go slightly over so that the rest of

122
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:30,190
us can help you golf it down and we've

123
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:31,389
actually golf down some pretty cool

124
00:05:31,389 --> 00:05:33,099
stuff especially in the past week which

125
00:05:33,099 --> 00:05:35,349
I'll share with you okay so no global

126
00:05:35,349 --> 00:05:37,389
leakage this is something that J&K

127
00:05:37,389 --> 00:05:39,879
doesn't enforce the whole point is these

128
00:05:39,879 --> 00:05:41,800
small little snippets I want to actually

129
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,000
would be cool if we create like an

130
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,759
actual collectible click usable library

131
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:47,440
of code you can just like drop in and so

132
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,599
if these things are all overriding I or

133
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:51,610
J it's not gonna work so no global

134
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:54,879
leakage also the license has to be the

135
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:57,159
WTF PL who here is familiar with this

136
00:05:57,159 --> 00:06:01,240
license okay if you're not you have like

137
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:04,070
five seconds to do that

138
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:06,300
yeah it's it's pretty simple in the guy

139
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:09,780
index is at zero hardcore okay and have

140
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:12,210
fun that is really important is the

141
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:15,300
point is that you know this is not it's

142
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:16,890
kind of easy to get lost and once you

143
00:06:16,890 --> 00:06:18,540
start golfing and you know get too

144
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:20,250
serious about it but the point is at the

145
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:21,780
end of the day this is a fun activity so

146
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:24,060
how do you play you go to the site you

147
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:25,950
fork the master gist you replace it with

148
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:29,010
your code you teach by annotation every

149
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:31,890
entry must have an annotation okay so

150
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:34,470
instead of like having it's like all the

151
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:35,280
opposite of what you would do in

152
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:38,760
production right instead of having a you

153
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,440
know regular code and then unifying it

154
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,760
you basically have unified code and you

155
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:44,100
expand it by annotating it right so each

156
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:45,030
line should have a comment you'll see

157
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:46,560
what that looks like and then you tell 1

158
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,240
40 bytes so that we can tweet it up to

159
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,760
the world but why would you do this it's

160
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,440
simple because small code means really

161
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:56,730
fast downloads that's not true um if

162
00:06:56,730 --> 00:06:57,870
you're doing this for that reason I'm

163
00:06:57,870 --> 00:06:59,220
gonna come and I'm gonna hurt you

164
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:01,290
seriously no the point is to learn okay

165
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:02,610
and the point is not only to learn

166
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:04,110
because you guys can learn java stir any

167
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:05,340
where the point is to learn the last

168
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:07,560
twenty percent of JavaScript okay I'm

169
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,300
not talking about you know for typical

170
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:10,680
inheritance and like any of that stuff

171
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,180
I'm talking about literally the dark

172
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:14,430
corners the language so if you guys are

173
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:20,430
familiar with the good parts he you'd is

174
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:25,560
the bad parts oh wow really applause for

175
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:30,660
Crawford with Morris sweet crowd I'm

176
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:32,190
gonna put to check marks nikla hoon

177
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:35,040
listen um but as my favorite other

178
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:38,850
favorite um programmer would probably

179
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:40,290
call it not the not the bad parts but

180
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:43,560
the no sea bass but this is actually I'm

181
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,690
sorry this is an old picture I think I

182
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:47,040
might have something more there we go

183
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,220
more recently

184
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:52,120
um so some examples okay and we're gonna

185
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:58,660
fly through these here um yeah so that

186
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:02,170
was it ladies gentlemen thank you okay

187
00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:06,490
okay I'm gonna go a little bit slower

188
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:08,260
we're gonna go like maybe like movie

189
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:12,280
credits so since May we have accumulated

190
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:16,060
uh yeah 200 and change entries I think

191
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:19,150
we're the most forked gist on github and

192
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:20,290
there's people have been doing all sorts

193
00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:22,480
of really cool stuff from the totally

194
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,910
trivial what does that pay per day yes

195
00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:26,410
yes actually you really have to check

196
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:27,790
out that one because it's not what you

197
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:29,890
think it's like it loads of a purge is

198
00:08:29,890 --> 00:08:31,360
from somewhere else it's like this we

199
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,950
filled 140 bites of just like the most

200
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:34,390
useless code anywhere and that was

201
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:36,159
actually written by Malta so you should

202
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:37,360
definitely compliment him on his style

203
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,610
all right so I'm gonna show you the mifi

204
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:40,810
favorites like this is just completely

205
00:08:40,810 --> 00:08:44,100
subjective this is what I really like um

206
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:46,450
this one's actually pretty cool konami

207
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:49,030
code so you put this code on your site

208
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:51,250
and then up up down down left right left

209
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:54,040
right ba will fire your callback right

210
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:54,970
that's pretty cool it's a fun little

211
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:57,700
entry but it's not just games there's

212
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:59,230
stuff it's a little bit you know more

213
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:02,050
useful this is felix is it felix i think

214
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:03,940
is here homburg oh you're right there

215
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:06,630
hey Felix shout out this guy is amazing

216
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:09,550
this is a loading spinner and this code

217
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:13,390
is fantastic it basically creates eight

218
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:15,010
elements each with that little dot and

219
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:17,170
then it you know rotates them so you get

220
00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:18,550
this loading spinner actually if I can

221
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:19,990
maybe to show you guys what that looks

222
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:31,890
like there it is right there

223
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:35,350
oh hey what's up what's going on in the

224
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:37,360
kitchen where we are ok uh and if you

225
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,590
like his spinning technology you're

226
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:39,820
gonna love spin Jade yes check it out

227
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:43,600
that was repelled number three a 140

228
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,700
bike par slur by sub Z this is a guy

229
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:47,380
I've never met him he's from Russia and

230
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:49,990
he's incredible at like parsing and so

231
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:51,970
this parse is this code that you see

232
00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:53,580
right here with all those alighted

233
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:57,790
elements in an array parses Roman

234
00:09:57,790 --> 00:10:02,040
numerals into numbers an incredible um

235
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:06,070
second game of life by Martin is Martin

236
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:08,350
here there is oh yeah that's Humber goal

237
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:10,510
no that's good so check this out guys is

238
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:12,010
the game of life you'd know what it is I

239
00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:14,620
think it's like the most miss named game

240
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:16,300
in history cuz not actually game but um

241
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:22,120
it's a cool thing you can watch right so

242
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,500
that whole thing 140 but it's just

243
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:26,740
amazing so good job on that and then

244
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:28,270
finally and most recently this is

245
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:29,320
something that actually was only

246
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,990
submitted last week an entire su doku

247
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:40,870
sovereign hun 40 bytes

248
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,130
right alright so that's us that kinda

249
00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:44,210
stuff you can build I'm gonna show you

250
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:46,400
the 10 tricks that we learned from

251
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,850
golfing over the past few months okay

252
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:51,700
but first I want to say two things

253
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:53,990
people who maybe might take this too

254
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:56,150
seriously I want you to know the point

255
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:58,700
of the code is not to be readable okay

256
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:00,140
the point of the code is to be small if

257
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:03,140
you want readable code read a dan brown

258
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:07,610
book you know you have to understand for

259
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:08,990
me this code is very reasonable because

260
00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:10,670
if you look at the script that I look at

261
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,950
all day for work it's this okay so

262
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:14,840
honestly not gonna complain bout before

263
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:18,050
dates and also I want you to treat this

264
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:19,730
as kind of like it's like kind of a

265
00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:22,100
warning like you shouldn't use this at

266
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:23,930
home right this isn't this is you know I

267
00:11:23,930 --> 00:11:25,220
wouldn't put a lot of this code in

268
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:27,080
production right so but this is just to

269
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,880
educate you about JavaScript so think of

270
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,180
it as like Grand Theft Auto j/s where

271
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:33,230
instead of acting out your minification

272
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:35,960
fantasies in production you do it in a

273
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:39,470
safety with your friends um because if

274
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:41,330
you put a lot of this code in you know

275
00:11:41,330 --> 00:11:42,860
like working stuff I'm gonna like

276
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:44,660
totally find you on the internet like

277
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:46,460
control all your comments well I don't

278
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:51,290
someone will anyway Terry the tricks

279
00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:52,460
we're gonna take the tricks they're

280
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:53,870
going to sort them we're actually gonna

281
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:56,090
sort them by level WTF where to reverse

282
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:58,220
that and slice it in it okay good lesson

283
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:01,940
okay so 10 spaces no spaces spaces are

284
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:05,570
not your friend so you know that space

285
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:07,220
right there you actually don't need it

286
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:08,780
right you can actually put anything

287
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:10,370
that's not going to be an identifier

288
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:12,680
right up against return or even type of

289
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:14,570
things like that I was one trick I

290
00:12:14,570 --> 00:12:19,460
learned 9 semicolons no try to get rid

291
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:21,170
of semicolons I mean I don't actually

292
00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:22,460
use semicolons anyway unless I have to

293
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:24,320
but there's actually places where you

294
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,250
can make your code its smaller by

295
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:27,410
writing it so you don't need semicolons

296
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:29,770
it's almost like giving your coat a

297
00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:32,840
semicolon osku p

298
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:40,889
oh there it is found it

299
00:12:40,899 --> 00:12:43,869
by the way by the way don't ever make a

300
00:12:43,869 --> 00:12:45,249
presentation where you have to google

301
00:12:45,249 --> 00:12:49,629
sim like colonoscopy seriously at like

302
00:12:49,629 --> 00:12:52,149
eight in the morning all right all right

303
00:12:52,149 --> 00:12:55,569
so take this code all right so how we've

304
00:12:55,569 --> 00:12:56,920
got that semicolon in there how can we

305
00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:00,069
get rid of it can anyone tell me how

306
00:13:00,069 --> 00:13:01,600
without actually changing what would

307
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,649
actually happen with this code how would

308
00:13:02,649 --> 00:13:04,929
actually get rid of time going get rid

309
00:13:04,929 --> 00:13:17,139
of who all right you're behind Susie is

310
00:13:17,139 --> 00:13:19,300
fantastic thank you here's how I did it

311
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:21,939
okay so make that function a declaration

312
00:13:21,939 --> 00:13:24,309
cuz declarations don't need and

313
00:13:24,309 --> 00:13:26,259
semicolons after them right I didn't

314
00:13:26,259 --> 00:13:29,709
know that uh here's one with document

315
00:13:29,709 --> 00:13:32,009
open then write hello and then closed

316
00:13:32,009 --> 00:13:35,499
okay so now we have well this is

317
00:13:35,499 --> 00:13:37,980
actually a comma could be I guess but um

318
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:39,999
all right so we actually can make that

319
00:13:39,999 --> 00:13:41,800
shorter but the only reason we could

320
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:42,759
have minified I could make a sort of

321
00:13:42,759 --> 00:13:43,959
necessarily the only reason we can make

322
00:13:43,959 --> 00:13:45,429
a service because we know how this code

323
00:13:45,429 --> 00:13:46,689
works and what we actually do is move

324
00:13:46,689 --> 00:13:49,769
close over here and then get rid of that

325
00:13:49,769 --> 00:13:51,790
right that's another that's another

326
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:53,980
trick you'll see a lot of eight loops we

327
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:57,009
can totally golf loops down here's some

328
00:13:57,009 --> 00:13:59,740
code so what is this cody ok we have

329
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:02,170
Naren we have I equals 0 and 4b

330
00:14:02,170 --> 00:14:03,990
envisages the global object in this case

331
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:06,999
set that index of the array to that key

332
00:14:06,999 --> 00:14:08,139
so we're getting this was basically

333
00:14:08,139 --> 00:14:10,389
object keys that works for everything

334
00:14:10,389 --> 00:14:11,559
right so we're gonna get all the keys

335
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:12,910
we're gonna put in this right okay but

336
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:15,309
we can actually golf this down and this

337
00:14:15,309 --> 00:14:16,720
is again something I learned only after

338
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:17,649
starting these contests we can actually

339
00:14:17,649 --> 00:14:20,319
switch these things so actually the

340
00:14:20,319 --> 00:14:21,879
thing that's like in like something in

341
00:14:21,879 --> 00:14:23,259
something that thing can just be

342
00:14:23,259 --> 00:14:25,389
anything that can be assigned right and

343
00:14:25,389 --> 00:14:27,009
so this thing we're actually it'll sign

344
00:14:27,009 --> 00:14:28,299
it for us which means we don't need that

345
00:14:28,299 --> 00:14:30,639
anymore right and as long as you lead

346
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:32,170
that well we don't even need that body

347
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:33,819
anymore he's replace it with semicolon

348
00:14:33,819 --> 00:14:35,350
right and we're not done yet cuz the

349
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:36,279
trick we just learned we can actually

350
00:14:36,279 --> 00:14:38,049
move that in over right so which Gulf

351
00:14:38,049 --> 00:14:40,360
that down I that was four bites through

352
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:43,169
keeping track at home represent

353
00:14:43,169 --> 00:14:45,309
you use numbers like this quadrillion

354
00:14:45,309 --> 00:14:46,719
well you can actually make that shorter

355
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:48,999
you can golf one character off love that

356
00:14:48,999 --> 00:14:52,059
15 0 SI using math.pow but actually four

357
00:14:52,059 --> 00:14:53,229
decimal we have a notation for that

358
00:14:53,229 --> 00:14:55,119
that's very short so you see that used a

359
00:14:55,119 --> 00:14:56,799
lot the decimal notation dennery

360
00:14:56,799 --> 00:14:58,479
notation colors too you know it's

361
00:14:58,479 --> 00:14:59,979
shorter decimals actually even shorter

362
00:14:59,979 --> 00:15:01,359
if you use an operator to create that

363
00:15:01,359 --> 00:15:05,799
number okay uh here's one infinity right

364
00:15:05,799 --> 00:15:07,839
to use infinity here in code well guess

365
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:10,209
what I just saved you like one two three

366
00:15:10,209 --> 00:15:13,659
four five bytes and not only do you get

367
00:15:13,659 --> 00:15:15,249
five bytes for free but you also get

368
00:15:15,249 --> 00:15:19,029
free internet points as which he is

369
00:15:19,029 --> 00:15:22,149
playing so I hadn't claimed mine yet by

370
00:15:22,149 --> 00:15:24,309
assume he's good for his word cuz he

371
00:15:24,309 --> 00:15:25,869
seems like a nice guy I'm number 6

372
00:15:25,869 --> 00:15:28,899
recurse recursion right oh it's so much

373
00:15:28,899 --> 00:15:30,729
your code can be so much cleaner like

374
00:15:30,729 --> 00:15:31,839
for example if you want to get all the

375
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:33,099
dominoes in a document that's gonna be

376
00:15:33,099 --> 00:15:35,139
recursive right we got a tree okay so we

377
00:15:35,139 --> 00:15:36,339
can write iterative code we're lucky to

378
00:15:36,339 --> 00:15:38,049
get well we have X that's gonna be the

379
00:15:38,049 --> 00:15:39,639
next thing we've see which is the first

380
00:15:39,639 --> 00:15:40,959
child now we've of this list we're gonna

381
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:42,849
cumulate while see we're gonna push to

382
00:15:42,849 --> 00:15:44,079
this ray and then we're gonna like

383
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:45,849
traverse down if there's nothing down

384
00:15:45,849 --> 00:15:48,189
and we go over and then for something

385
00:15:48,189 --> 00:15:49,779
over we go up and then we finally hit

386
00:15:49,779 --> 00:15:51,519
the last thing so we're done and so we

387
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:53,139
return the new list okay well we can

388
00:15:53,139 --> 00:15:54,819
actually do that by just having a

389
00:15:54,819 --> 00:15:56,529
recursive function that says okay well

390
00:15:56,529 --> 00:15:58,089
if the node this wasn't there create it

391
00:15:58,089 --> 00:16:01,539
and then right basically we're curse ok

392
00:16:01,539 --> 00:16:03,939
that's a group is a function so I'm do

393
00:16:03,939 --> 00:16:05,289
you guys do you guys like writing

394
00:16:05,289 --> 00:16:08,919
recursively yeah i know someone who's

395
00:16:08,919 --> 00:16:11,829
excellent at writing recursively you

396
00:16:11,829 --> 00:16:16,419
guys want to see one second sorry she's

397
00:16:16,419 --> 00:16:20,170
right over there

398
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:27,740
ladies gentlemen recursive writing sorry

399
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:33,110
that was a super super cheesy joke um

400
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:36,870
but seriously uh oops hey let's see this

401
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:38,579
again that was fun Ruth at guys hey

402
00:16:38,579 --> 00:16:39,600
remember we told the Gulf that down

403
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,730
those one this is the hardest working

404
00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:44,220
person that Jay is cough so I stick over

405
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:51,680
the applause is fantastic

406
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:54,770
awesome work and she's like like 10

407
00:16:54,770 --> 00:16:56,000
hours straight without taking mini break

408
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,990
so super super props um all right hmm so

409
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:02,180
next thing we can do we can outsource so

410
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:04,819
if we want to escape HTML right so you

411
00:17:04,819 --> 00:17:05,870
want to like escape something like that

412
00:17:05,870 --> 00:17:07,280
so it doesn't get injector our code we

413
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,260
want to look like that well we could do

414
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:11,300
it the way that backbone does it right

415
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:13,010
they use all these regex is right but if

416
00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:14,480
we know that we're in the browser we can

417
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:15,890
actually do it a little bit smarter than

418
00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:19,339
that um we can actually create create an

419
00:17:19,339 --> 00:17:22,939
element create text node appendage wat

420
00:17:22,939 --> 00:17:25,040
the techno to the element right its node

421
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,929
value and then read the inner HTML from

422
00:17:26,929 --> 00:17:29,120
its parent right so that's a you know

423
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:33,200
completely Dom based way of escaping

424
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,640
HTML 4 units for free and you don't have

425
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,929
to worry about whatever those red x's

426
00:17:35,929 --> 00:17:37,370
are because if your browser can't do it

427
00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:39,500
right then you're in trouble anyway it's

428
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:40,760
actually going to be even shorter and

429
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,050
this is this is like I discovered like

430
00:17:42,050 --> 00:17:44,059
like three years ago that some forget if

431
00:17:44,059 --> 00:17:46,850
think it was Eli did this but there's

432
00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:48,710
the option constructor that'll create an

433
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:51,380
option element and whatever its argument

434
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:53,510
is will actually put the HTML like what

435
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:54,800
I did that with that so you can actually

436
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,090
that actually doesn't work in IE

437
00:17:56,090 --> 00:17:57,850
something I don't care personally but

438
00:17:57,850 --> 00:18:00,710
but yes so so yeah that was actually

439
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:02,600
kind of a fun surprise or if you want to

440
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:07,900
parse URL you know this is from a URL

441
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:10,400
library and node and so you know this

442
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,330
code is good because it's written by

443
00:18:11,330 --> 00:18:14,630
Isaac and it's long it's really long are

444
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:16,040
forcing your words like super hard it's

445
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:18,830
like you know like 6k okay but we

446
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:20,870
already have a browser so it's actually

447
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:22,220
pretty easy all you have to do is create

448
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:23,809
an element and instead its href and then

449
00:18:23,809 --> 00:18:25,250
you can read any property of it cuz it

450
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:26,660
just like the location object will parse

451
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:28,429
that for you right so that's like a cool

452
00:18:28,429 --> 00:18:30,970
way to save code number for introspect

453
00:18:30,970 --> 00:18:34,220
okay i'm gonna get all bro Graham Ronnie

454
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:36,360
right there with my favorite bro

455
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:44,130
amer is that so uh you know you got the

456
00:18:44,130 --> 00:18:46,290
red bull it's rectal in twenty-four

457
00:18:46,290 --> 00:18:49,650
seven uh and so let's uh let's grok it

458
00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:52,200
let's see what it's got take the string

459
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,750
prototype get the own property names

460
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:56,760
since you we got oh look at this list I

461
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:59,640
know these things out man slice totally

462
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:02,280
use at all time care at totally value of

463
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:04,740
oh my god awesome search yet a search it

464
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:08,610
totally wait what huh what's this what's

465
00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:10,530
a home this stuff at the bottom we suck

466
00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:17,850
I'm sorry I'm sorry yo sup but note is

467
00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:24,240
your homie cuz uh it'll say sup yo go

468
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:27,629
Matt the brow

469
00:19:27,639 --> 00:19:30,769
yes there are all of these like relics

470
00:19:30,769 --> 00:19:32,870
from the 90s that lurk on the string

471
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:35,809
prototype so you sub sub you can beg you

472
00:19:35,809 --> 00:19:37,669
can small you can bold you canít Alex

473
00:19:37,669 --> 00:19:40,909
you can strike you can font color you

474
00:19:40,909 --> 00:19:43,429
can font size and any size I guess and

475
00:19:43,429 --> 00:19:46,700
you can anchor and actually you can link

476
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:48,950
and I've used this there is a 140 by

477
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:51,980
century that will turn a tweet into

478
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:55,240
valid HTML it'll take any link any

479
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:57,590
mention or any hashtag and put any

480
00:19:57,590 --> 00:19:58,970
channel for you we use that function do

481
00:19:58,970 --> 00:20:00,049
it that was actually very helpful and

482
00:20:00,049 --> 00:20:01,879
then come on you could not you could do

483
00:20:01,879 --> 00:20:04,730
with that blank like what blink were you

484
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:08,419
guys thinking it's crazy yeah it's the

485
00:20:08,419 --> 00:20:10,700
most fascinating relic from the 90s I've

486
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:14,419
seen in a long time since the hit single

487
00:20:14,419 --> 00:20:18,230
Chumbawamba tub-thumping from 1997 I

488
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:20,720
believe okay so and programming thank

489
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:29,809
you there were three coerce uh so if you

490
00:20:29,809 --> 00:20:31,490
want to get a uuid you know these things

491
00:20:31,490 --> 00:20:33,409
look like here's twenty of them for free

492
00:20:33,409 --> 00:20:34,549
feel free to use that in your code

493
00:20:34,549 --> 00:20:36,620
that's a freebie if you want more talk

494
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:40,159
to me later this is version 4 ok so you

495
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:41,509
ideas all these specifications and they

496
00:20:41,509 --> 00:20:42,529
have to do special stuff a version for

497
00:20:42,529 --> 00:20:44,779
says basically almost all these things

498
00:20:44,779 --> 00:20:45,980
are just random numbers so if you just

499
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:47,299
have random numbers it's okay except for

500
00:20:47,299 --> 00:20:49,940
a few places a few exceptions so I was

501
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:51,769
like okay I wrote this code and I was

502
00:20:51,769 --> 00:20:53,870
like 000 blah blah blah and I'm just

503
00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:55,100
replace all the zeros of random numbers

504
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:57,049
using this ring place function but then

505
00:20:57,049 --> 00:20:58,850
this guy subzi came along and he's like

506
00:20:58,850 --> 00:21:00,769
no do you check it out look what I can

507
00:21:00,769 --> 00:21:03,559
do change all has changed the first zero

508
00:21:03,559 --> 00:21:05,600
to one each one of those things all

509
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:08,149
right fine that same length okay now how

510
00:21:08,149 --> 00:21:09,799
to string and then take a number right

511
00:21:09,799 --> 00:21:11,330
all right so it's longer now what are

512
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:13,490
you doing okay well alright okay so now

513
00:21:13,490 --> 00:21:14,899
he's using the dinner invitation that's

514
00:21:14,899 --> 00:21:16,490
cool and you're starting with a string

515
00:21:16,490 --> 00:21:18,139
so everything gets coerced into a string

516
00:21:18,139 --> 00:21:19,879
there's likely cool now we can do a

517
00:21:19,879 --> 00:21:21,919
hyphen and then a thousand alright cool

518
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:23,960
but you actually can turn a thousand

519
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:26,389
back to the 123 but then with the Chi

520
00:21:26,389 --> 00:21:28,370
Fionn it doesn't even need to be hyphen

521
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:29,750
you can coerce a negative number and

522
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:32,510
they'll get the hyphen for free

523
00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:35,390
it's crazy this guy's crazy it's awesome

524
00:21:35,390 --> 00:21:38,000
and you just keep doing that oops sorry

525
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,860
and you got that thing all the way down

526
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:42,710
that is just kind of tiny anyway so that

527
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:45,350
was very very surprising number two you

528
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:49,250
have to exploit um so here are all the

529
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:51,590
operators in Java Script love some of

530
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:53,360
these guys you're gonna have to really

531
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,920
just exploit the heck out of these guys

532
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:56,200
they will do a lot of work for you

533
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:58,070
because they're tiny you want them in

534
00:21:58,070 --> 00:22:00,620
your code so can anyone tell me who can

535
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:03,800
guess my favorite operator up there huh

536
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:11,860
not comma I'm sorry it's the tilde hey

537
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:15,200
seriously the tilde is the smoothest of

538
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:18,830
the operators well I'm glad she had hits

539
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:19,790
here too because I was worried about

540
00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:23,360
that um it means it's a bitwise not okay

541
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:24,920
and if you know what that means you are

542
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,390
way ahead of me because I didn't it

543
00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:28,670
inverts the bits of its operand all

544
00:22:28,670 --> 00:22:31,700
right whatever here's what it does okay

545
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:33,830
in layman's terms gonna do uh it turns

546
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:35,270
anything into a number it's like a plus

547
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:37,490
sign will have na n if it's not an

548
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:38,840
actual number this thing will number

549
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:40,580
anything right I'll turn it into a zero

550
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:42,290
if it's not a number okay then it'll add

551
00:22:42,290 --> 00:22:44,870
one and then it will negate it right

552
00:22:44,870 --> 00:22:46,310
it's so like why is that useful well

553
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:47,420
actually we can do some cool things with

554
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:51,170
that by kind of abusing it so here's

555
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:52,700
basically what it looks like right so

556
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:54,770
till the 0 negative 1 you can see the

557
00:22:54,770 --> 00:22:56,180
pattern here right but this is the

558
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:57,440
coolest property is that if you put it

559
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,670
undefined I'll actually it'll be

560
00:22:58,670 --> 00:23:00,020
negative one so you can use that to

561
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:02,000
floor instead of using mass floor you

562
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,060
can use a double dildo and I'm sure Alex

563
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:06,680
exum has a cute word for that operator I

564
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:09,140
should ask him about that um that one

565
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:11,290
gets used a lot you can also use 0 bar

566
00:23:11,290 --> 00:23:14,600
which is cool but also the one you see a

567
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,610
lot in in 140 bites introduces the

568
00:23:16,610 --> 00:23:18,320
ghetto operator which is right there

569
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:20,630
sorry too ghetto iterator it's right

570
00:23:20,630 --> 00:23:22,490
there this thing is crazy because it

571
00:23:22,490 --> 00:23:23,990
does not care that your variable has not

572
00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:26,840
been assigned yet it does not care and

573
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:28,910
so it'll just keep adding one so

574
00:23:28,910 --> 00:23:30,440
basically it like okay but the number is

575
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:32,300
zero it'll turn it into a negative one

576
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:33,800
but I'll negate it it starts at one so

577
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:34,940
basically the first time you do this

578
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:36,230
it'll set to one

579
00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:37,280
time you execute this thing here it'll

580
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,470
up one right on them so we actually use

581
00:23:39,470 --> 00:23:41,600
this in the JSON p code for 1 40 bytes

582
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:44,330
okay check this out this is crazy okay

583
00:23:44,330 --> 00:23:45,530
so you have a function with

584
00:23:45,530 --> 00:23:46,910
document.body.appendchild create an

585
00:23:46,910 --> 00:23:48,890
element script fine set the source equal

586
00:23:48,890 --> 00:23:52,400
to a which is the original URL + C which

587
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,919
we you know which we are setting to D

588
00:23:54,919 --> 00:23:56,510
which was script so we can name it plus

589
00:23:56,510 --> 00:23:59,120
and here's the crazy part ETA equals

590
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:01,730
negative tilde a okay so he is the

591
00:24:01,730 --> 00:24:03,260
function that actually we're rewriting

592
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:05,059
right now and a is some random property

593
00:24:05,059 --> 00:24:06,710
that we never ever signed so this thing

594
00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:08,330
never knows if it's if it's the first

595
00:24:08,330 --> 00:24:09,799
time it's been called or not right and

596
00:24:09,799 --> 00:24:11,210
saves the state and so this way we don't

597
00:24:11,210 --> 00:24:13,309
care just like call this thing as many

598
00:24:13,309 --> 00:24:14,630
times if you want each time it'll do

599
00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:16,640
it'll set the callback with this JSON

600
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,990
PETA script one script to script

601
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:20,510
threescore 45 those can easily but

602
00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:22,549
here's the number-one dirtiest tack and

603
00:24:22,549 --> 00:24:24,260
this was last week and this is actually

604
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:31,929
Felix also in back all right

605
00:24:31,929 --> 00:24:34,690
so this is the su doku solver this

606
00:24:34,690 --> 00:24:36,789
solves your Sudokus for you so you can

607
00:24:36,789 --> 00:24:38,110
stop sitting on the train or whatever in

608
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:39,759
doing them just you know fire this up in

609
00:24:39,759 --> 00:24:42,340
your browser all right can anyone tell

610
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:48,039
me what is funky about this code oh come

611
00:24:48,039 --> 00:24:50,590
on not you yeah you'll get yours later

612
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:54,669
anyone all right here's the thing see

613
00:24:54,669 --> 00:24:56,759
that you on the second line at the end

614
00:24:56,759 --> 00:25:01,960
what is that we haven't defined that so

615
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,820
what happens when you try to accessing

616
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:05,409
you haven't defined right well you

617
00:25:05,409 --> 00:25:06,580
should fire up node you type units like

618
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:08,970
reference area you was not to find okay

619
00:25:08,970 --> 00:25:10,869
so here's we're doing we're actually

620
00:25:10,869 --> 00:25:12,610
putting that you there because you get a

621
00:25:12,610 --> 00:25:14,080
reference ever to stop the iterations

622
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,580
for cursive iteration rights recursive

623
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:17,830
and so we didn't have enough characters

624
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:18,759
like a hundred thirty eight characters

625
00:25:18,759 --> 00:25:20,559
we'd enough to actually stop so we just

626
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:22,509
throw so like you actually to use this

627
00:25:22,509 --> 00:25:23,740
to no clue solver you have to wrap it in

628
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:29,619
try catch

629
00:25:29,629 --> 00:25:34,700
Felix back there nice what Felix um

630
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:38,220
lumberg represent and so so you can

631
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:40,409
throw in one bite was kind of cool but

632
00:25:40,409 --> 00:25:41,789
what if you're worried that like the use

633
00:25:41,789 --> 00:25:43,399
this function elsewhere what if you is

634
00:25:43,399 --> 00:25:46,889
already defined then what then it's not

635
00:25:46,889 --> 00:25:50,100
gonna throw well if anyone can solve

636
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:51,600
this problem it's you guys cuz I have to

637
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:57,360
do that moon loud let's do exactly yes

638
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:59,159
probably the the chances are there's a

639
00:25:59,159 --> 00:26:01,679
variable with that e is probably not

640
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:04,259
very high so um so that's that's that's

641
00:26:04,259 --> 00:26:07,139
140 x to the top 10 stupid tricks for 1

642
00:26:07,139 --> 00:26:09,809
40 bytes that we learned so we have the

643
00:26:09,809 --> 00:26:11,309
site that has all these things and you

644
00:26:11,309 --> 00:26:12,450
can actually see them you can reuse them

645
00:26:12,450 --> 00:26:14,129
if you want and we have a leaderboard

646
00:26:14,129 --> 00:26:16,590
that shows you all these people many of

647
00:26:16,590 --> 00:26:18,450
whom are here who contributed to this

648
00:26:18,450 --> 00:26:20,220
project what's really cool about this

649
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:21,240
that I like though is that it's

650
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:23,909
completely dog fruited right so thanks

651
00:26:23,909 --> 00:26:26,100
to that guy over there Alex cloths can I

652
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:30,299
just get a random puzzle lumsden

653
00:26:30,299 --> 00:26:32,309
wouldn't do that but their days we

654
00:26:32,309 --> 00:26:34,499
actually reuse a lot of these entries to

655
00:26:34,499 --> 00:26:36,450
build the site itself so the site itself

656
00:26:36,450 --> 00:26:38,730
is a single page app that's made up of a

657
00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:40,440
lot of those entries which is really

658
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:42,899
cool um and you can tell in the source

659
00:26:42,899 --> 00:26:44,360
code it's pretty obvious

660
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:47,720
when you get to the bottom um but yeah

661
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:49,640
that's that's kind of cool and so what

662
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:50,809
we've done is we've taken all of his

663
00:26:50,809 --> 00:26:52,070
golfing advice every time we discover a

664
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:54,230
new nugget we put it in the wiki let me

665
00:26:54,230 --> 00:26:56,059
actually show what that looks like so

666
00:26:56,059 --> 00:26:59,030
Eva waked page um that game of life

667
00:26:59,030 --> 00:27:02,360
still running that's crazy um yeah so

668
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:05,630
like all these things all these tricks

669
00:27:05,630 --> 00:27:06,950
so you can actually check those out it's

670
00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:08,510
kind of cool and then if we have a wish

671
00:27:08,510 --> 00:27:09,559
list so if you want to check out you're

672
00:27:09,559 --> 00:27:10,760
gonna add something like I think someone

673
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:12,650
could do this and they'll try it let me

674
00:27:12,650 --> 00:27:14,360
do this with a lot of es five ish

675
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:17,570
polyfills disclaimer ish polyfills uh

676
00:27:17,570 --> 00:27:23,240
and we actually we golfed base64

677
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:27,169
encoding down what to like like sub 100

678
00:27:27,169 --> 00:27:29,150
territory um that was right pretty cool

679
00:27:29,150 --> 00:27:32,450
and so now what how much time do I have

680
00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:35,690
is it written somewhere three minutes oh

681
00:27:35,690 --> 00:27:39,049
sweet all right uh well so basically I

682
00:27:39,049 --> 00:27:40,910
guess I'm out of time which would a

683
00:27:40,910 --> 00:27:43,850
shame I've no slides left but there's a

684
00:27:43,850 --> 00:27:45,200
few things I'm working on that I thought

685
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,370
was kind of cool you should check out

686
00:27:46,370 --> 00:27:48,380
the first is kibbe this is something I

687
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:49,790
intended to launch your rent at a time

688
00:27:49,790 --> 00:27:52,880
but kibbe is ajs 1k web framework does

689
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:55,120
everything you need is templating json p

690
00:27:55,120 --> 00:28:00,320
and a router and escaping and all that

691
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,870
stuff and so you can create a very tiny

692
00:28:02,870 --> 00:28:04,100
web app with that and it's completely

693
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:05,690
self loathing which is pretty cool I

694
00:28:05,690 --> 00:28:07,700
also wrote name-drop which is an

695
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:09,320
incredibly crazy thing that basically

696
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:10,640
it's of one function that's a hundred

697
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,620
bites and you give it anything and it

698
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:14,000
will iterate through all the keys and

699
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,570
it'll basically scrunch them down to two

700
00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:18,740
bites of JavaScript valid JavaScript

701
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:20,750
identifier and then you can use that to

702
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:22,340
not ever mention so if you have like

703
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:24,770
create document fragment you just give

704
00:28:24,770 --> 00:28:27,110
document to this function and it'll

705
00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:28,910
actually hash that down two bytes so

706
00:28:28,910 --> 00:28:30,770
it's accessible by two bytes I'm not

707
00:28:30,770 --> 00:28:31,970
sure whether this actually saves you buy

708
00:28:31,970 --> 00:28:34,220
some long run if you're gossiping but

709
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:35,330
it's kind of a cool experiment that I'm

710
00:28:35,330 --> 00:28:36,919
gonna continue another thing you should

711
00:28:36,919 --> 00:28:38,330
definitely check out his jazz crush a

712
00:28:38,330 --> 00:28:41,870
Jess crush this is poor man's gzip it's

713
00:28:41,870 --> 00:28:44,210
fantastic it basically it almost it look

714
00:28:44,210 --> 00:28:45,620
it's like it's basically a very similar

715
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:48,200
algorithm that just basically takes your

716
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:50,570
code and just totally squashes it it

717
00:28:50,570 --> 00:28:51,650
doesn't actually do it a JavaScript

718
00:28:51,650 --> 00:28:52,820
level does it the string level so it's

719
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:54,590
actually very very it gets your job

720
00:28:54,590 --> 00:28:56,120
they'll save you like 500 bites on the

721
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:56,880
jace one pan for

722
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:57,990
and so you'll see a lot of these days

723
00:28:57,990 --> 00:28:59,280
one kind of entries actually use that

724
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:01,710
which is cool and finally my favorite

725
00:29:01,710 --> 00:29:04,080
before you crush you gotta uglify and

726
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:06,510
then together you can ugly crush and so

727
00:29:06,510 --> 00:29:08,700
above is the library and below is you

728
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:11,550
know is Marines awesome thing that he's

729
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:14,280
hosting that lets you do it in line and

730
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:15,540
so that's it thank you guys for

731
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:36,950
listening

732
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:46,059
any questions oh no oh no Jed where does

733
00:29:46,059 --> 00:29:47,830
your fascination with small things come

734
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:53,350
from I live in Japan dude this is like

735
00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:55,150
it's so nice cuz like it's finally I

736
00:29:55,150 --> 00:29:56,289
don't have to be the tallest guy at the

737
00:29:56,289 --> 00:29:58,720
Congress anymore yeah and I get the

738
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,429
enjoyment of having to pee up into the

739
00:30:00,429 --> 00:30:03,000
urinal just kind of new thing for me but

740
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:09,220
that needs your question okay any other

741
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:12,130
questions awesome thank you guys very

742
00:30:12,130 --> 00:30:18,730
much psych bitwise not what's up are you

743
00:30:18,730 --> 00:30:20,679
looking at 140 bites the characters can

744
00:30:20,679 --> 00:30:23,110
I do like a full bite you're a UDF

745
00:30:23,110 --> 00:30:25,899
character so I guess you got here late

746
00:30:25,899 --> 00:30:29,260
now I'm sorry um it's a we're keeping it

747
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:30,970
pure we're keeping it keeping the pipes

748
00:30:30,970 --> 00:30:33,549
because uh yeah we're trying to solve a

749
00:30:33,549 --> 00:30:35,110
problem think the thing about Jason 1k

750
00:30:35,110 --> 00:30:36,669
it's really cool but like if the thing

751
00:30:36,669 --> 00:30:38,289
is if everyone starts everyone basically

752
00:30:38,289 --> 00:30:40,419
what I mean it doesn't make sense not to

753
00:30:40,419 --> 00:30:42,700
low Jays crush before whereas the 140

754
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:44,140
bite is a really cool level to not have

755
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:45,130
any of that infrastructure you can

756
00:30:45,130 --> 00:30:46,120
actually use me as death it's not gonna

757
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:47,409
come in handy because by the time you

758
00:30:47,409 --> 00:30:48,490
have this function that squashes your

759
00:30:48,490 --> 00:30:50,529
stuff you only have 40 bytes left and so

760
00:30:50,529 --> 00:30:52,570
want to keep it super small and I think

761
00:30:52,570 --> 00:30:54,520
it's actually a good sweet spot for just

762
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:55,750
like straight up code that's not

763
00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:59,429
pretreated at all but yeah so it's bites

764
00:30:59,429 --> 00:31:02,529
anything else final answer all right

765
00:31:02,529 --> 00:31:07,049
guys
