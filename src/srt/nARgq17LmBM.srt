1
00:00:04,509 --> 00:00:13,539

I haven't been in Singapore for even a

2
00:00:13,539 --> 00:00:16,480
whole day so I'm like that's trying to

3
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,310
stay with your dreamy and sleepy and

4
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:20,349
everything seems with an amazing of the

5
00:00:20,349 --> 00:00:23,500
center so if something I'm saying sounds

6
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:28,449
weird it's my current jet lag state so

7
00:00:28,449 --> 00:00:29,500
when I come back to learn that you

8
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:30,940
should ask me the same question and it

9
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:35,829
would make more sense so that's it yeah

10
00:00:35,829 --> 00:00:39,909
so I'm self-analysis jason said I worked

11
00:00:39,909 --> 00:00:43,210
for Mozilla I am in the London office so

12
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:44,409
that means right now is like three or

13
00:00:44,409 --> 00:00:48,999
four a.m. my time and I'm I just been

14
00:00:48,999 --> 00:00:50,319
the devil team I just moved to the

15
00:00:50,319 --> 00:00:52,269
Firefox of those same because I wanted

16
00:00:52,269 --> 00:00:53,889
to make the tools better so I'm now an

17
00:00:53,889 --> 00:00:57,069
interview manager there and I'm not

18
00:00:57,069 --> 00:00:59,280
Spanish as you can say i'm not very like

19
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,280
sending English very English so because

20
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,040
English is not my first language I do

21
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,990
think that native speakers don't which

22
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:10,810
is wonder about the language so when I

23
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:12,880
feel expressions like it's raining cats

24
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:16,780
and dogs I'm like what so I went to the

25
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:18,490
internet and i searched what that means

26
00:01:18,490 --> 00:01:20,740
and it brings you back to an old time

27
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:24,220
where the streets were full of provision

28
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:26,380
dead animals and when it rained it

29
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:28,660
rained so hard that it would just carry

30
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:30,490
away all the dead animals so that's what

31
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:32,110
it means that when it's raining cats and

32
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:34,390
dogs and another expression that has

33
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:36,550
been interesting to me lately it's been

34
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:40,240
going against the grain and so again I

35
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,560
wish I'd what does this actually mean

36
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:44,650
and the dictionary says that is contrary

37
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:46,510
to natural inclination of feeling of

38
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:48,909
someone or something it goes against the

39
00:01:48,909 --> 00:01:51,010
grain to tell outright lies from the

40
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:53,080
fact that food is easy to cut along the

41
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:55,780
lane the line of the grain and I am a

42
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:57,640
software developer in session r idea how

43
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,800
you cut wood so I went to the internet

44
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:02,440
again and it's told me that it was easy

45
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:04,210
to cut along the grain and across the

46
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:06,940
grain I still didn't know what did mean

47
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:08,830
because you know like even Buddha would

48
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:11,050
use nowadays is fake so I'm like I don't

49
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:13,659
know but the internet is amazing it gave

50
00:02:13,659 --> 00:02:17,300
me a diagram so it shows you what along

51
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:19,280
close the crime mins so it was like oh

52
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,200
yeah those timber people like when they

53
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,940
go with the arcs if they go with the

54
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:25,160
arcs across this line is very easy you

55
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,690
get your visit up they are cutting a

56
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:28,520
tree that in that direction but you

57
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,530
never see them cut on the other action

58
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:31,940
you see them but it takes them longer

59
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:36,320
it's not like one clean cut so the oil

60
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38,510
interesting fact the internet told me is

61
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:40,430
that the bull is also stronger along the

62
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:43,280
grain so if you give a caretaker one of

63
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,140
those plans the first one is going to be

64
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:47,720
harder to kind of like just slicing just

65
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:50,570
one hit the second one which you can't

66
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:52,850
really see very well but it's like cut

67
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:54,620
in the other direction so this is going

68
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:56,750
to break you can see that this is like

69
00:02:56,750 --> 00:03:00,590
total set out like if a kratika can cut

70
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:01,850
that you know that it's not a very good

71
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:05,740
caretaker so my car was very interesting

72
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:07,970
another thing that the internet show me

73
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:10,070
is an a demo of days with the spaghetti

74
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:12,500
so you can see this is blood grain

75
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,630
fibers and you can see that this is the

76
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:16,220
effect that you will get when you cut

77
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:18,290
with an axe along the direction of the

78
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:23,120
grain so the other final call saying

79
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,860
that the internet tell me about both and

80
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:26,989
grains is that you also need to keep

81
00:03:26,989 --> 00:03:28,340
this thing in mind when you apply polish

82
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:31,190
or you get these scratches which are

83
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:33,170
awful this is what happens when you can

84
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:35,540
affect some against the direction of the

85
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:38,480
grain sound like this is so cool like

86
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,550
the crane is intrinsic to the balls so

87
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:42,200
if you do things properly you can like

88
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:45,350
very nice finish product they are really

89
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:46,970
nice to look at your like oh this is

90
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:49,430
like good artisanal crafty work but if

91
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:50,959
you don't do that if you just ignore the

92
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:52,820
fact that bull has grain you get things

93
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:55,670
that Flint's a scratch or brittle they

94
00:03:55,670 --> 00:04:00,170
break and you're like interesting I was

95
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:02,540
like like this I'm a screen like yeah

96
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:05,330
this sounds familiar this is just like

97
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:06,860
more than web development we're just

98
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:08,660
ignoring the grain we're just doing

99
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:10,520
whatever we think it's cool and then

100
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:13,519
everything breaks and it's like I don't

101
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:16,190
know what you did here and all the talks

102
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:18,769
today have been mentioned a like prison

103
00:04:18,769 --> 00:04:20,630
use bootstrap please don't do these

104
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:22,280
please don't break the browser's I'm

105
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:24,110
like this is very good because you like

106
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:26,210
telling things I'm really caring about

107
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:29,970
so what's the web natural direction and

108
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:33,300
I'm going to be captain obvious but hTML

109
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:35,640
free content is a representation and

110
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,830
generous giver functionality you would

111
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:40,350
think that people would know the things

112
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:44,010
nowadays but no so when you build with

113
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:45,480
these principles in mind you're cutting

114
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,550
along the green which is the good thing

115
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:48,990
and you're playing to the website

116
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:52,020
strengths I would go into more detail

117
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:53,820
but that's basically what I want to like

118
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:58,530
hint I can stress today even if this is

119
00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:00,930
just a CSS conference CSS is so

120
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:02,640
connected to everything you can't just

121
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:06,660
take one thing and ignore the rest so

122
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:08,550
you build websites this way they're

123
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:10,470
delightful to use because you know the

124
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:13,710
browser can do the browser job and also

125
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:17,760
still there also job so let the browser

126
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,620
do what I can do like you know like

127
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:22,350
stretch things around zoom in zoom out

128
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:25,470
the kind of things use keyboards that

129
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:27,060
kind of things that process let you do

130
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:29,040
when you don't mess with the browser and

131
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,960
then you can just fill the gaps for

132
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,250
extra things that the president doesn't

133
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:34,290
know yet and maybe it will do the

134
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:36,750
feature if enough also ask the browser

135
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:40,440
vendors to do that so some developers

136
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,270
will against the web natural direction

137
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:46,530
they say i want to have full control but

138
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:48,750
what happens is like they interfere with

139
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:50,340
the browser and you end up with those

140
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:52,290
things like the little cross as Chris

141
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:53,850
was mentioning where you kind of press

142
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:56,430
ask you cannot press the cross you kind

143
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:58,980
of tap away because there is no normal

144
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:00,990
interface like nothing works as a

145
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:03,120
respect so that's very frustrating to

146
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,000
use or do you go for presale tix are

147
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,060
perfect device this is bad but it's even

148
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:11,370
worse and phones when you have an

149
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:13,380
android phone and you get off an iphone

150
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:15,540
do i because they want to make things

151
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:18,540
native or when you have an iphone and

152
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:20,070
you get material design and you're like

153
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:22,410
I don't know what this is anymore this

154
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:24,390
is all very strange so this is the

155
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:28,950
uncanny valley of UI design or you get

156
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:31,350
this long time for requests to render

157
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:34,620
where you like waiting and waiting I can

158
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:37,560
fill this a lot because I used roaming a

159
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,040
lot

160
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:40,530
when I'm traveling alone and when you're

161
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:42,810
and roaming I pani your data goes

162
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:45,600
through your server in your country so

163
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:49,950
it takes long so you're like waiting and

164
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:52,010
waiting I eventually just give up

165
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:53,910
especially when you don't get any render

166
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:55,470
at all when something breaks on the

167
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:58,410
meantime there is a timeout nothing

168
00:06:58,410 --> 00:07:00,810
renders and you're like okay fine I just

169
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:02,490
wanted to see the many on your website

170
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:04,610
but now i'm not going to your restaurant

171
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:07,620
so they all think that but developer

172
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:09,960
store is ignoring aspects that exist in

173
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,490
the platform it's like ignoring the

174
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:14,280
grain they assume that there is no

175
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:17,490
network like things magically come to

176
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:20,910
your device they also know that the

177
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:23,070
browser raises many of the things they

178
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:25,440
are implementing and they also ignore

179
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,900
all the uses like I really like the top

180
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,730
from craves like make things work with

181
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:31,890
universal design it's a bit like the

182
00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:33,210
kind of things I'm worried about it's

183
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:35,070
like they're like oh were crying my

184
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:39,060
computer with my super accurate mobility

185
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:41,520
but you try to give them to other people

186
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,070
and you can't they can't use the

187
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:46,320
products they're like I this is this

188
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:48,180
menu this rule over men is too far for

189
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:50,700
me I can't focus and it can make people

190
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:55,110
cry it's really they also know that the

191
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:56,790
web environment is unpredictable and

192
00:07:56,790 --> 00:08:00,390
it's unknown it's not just about people

193
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:03,210
using strange forms of people using

194
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:06,390
things on 3g and 40 or whatever it's all

195
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:09,960
about people installing plugins on their

196
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:12,570
browsers and also about people using

197
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:15,300
websites with things like assistive

198
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:17,760
technology stuff like screen readers or

199
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:20,310
like even real reader mode is a version

200
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:24,390
of assistive technology you can have so

201
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:26,430
many things in the environment that you

202
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:27,960
kind of read trusted javascript your

203
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,430
road is a javascript is going to be

204
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:33,240
executed so if you expect that your

205
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,070
whole app is going to work because you

206
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:37,290
assume this kind of like idea of pure

207
00:08:37,290 --> 00:08:39,030
JavaScript environment you're going to

208
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:43,560
like set fall for a disaster so what

209
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:44,970
happens is the day to implement things

210
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:48,150
are exist battling and then they create

211
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:49,950
junk accessibility things that cannot be

212
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:51,649
used or things are just

213
00:08:51,649 --> 00:08:54,259
drain battery and it's like all terrible

214
00:08:54,259 --> 00:08:56,240
and Bob and it makes me so sad and so

215
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,269
upset at the same time and this is all

216
00:08:59,269 --> 00:09:02,379
because we want to make an appt and now

217
00:09:02,379 --> 00:09:05,149
so the private days is that the

218
00:09:05,149 --> 00:09:07,430
developers of this kind of apps I like I

219
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:10,309
really hate web development this is so

220
00:09:10,309 --> 00:09:14,749
awful and terrible they go to medium and

221
00:09:14,749 --> 00:09:17,029
blood a post about how terrible web

222
00:09:17,029 --> 00:09:19,339
government is nowadays and it's like so

223
00:09:19,339 --> 00:09:22,790
awful and then people hate using these

224
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:25,059
kind of things because they are so

225
00:09:25,059 --> 00:09:28,660
against users their aunt Alice's

226
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:32,720
traveling here too I am up fold at this

227
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,259
I have have bosses insisting had to be

228
00:09:36,259 --> 00:09:38,420
picture-perfect and things like that I'm

229
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:40,490
like you know the web is not about pics

230
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:42,259
a favor and keep it be like no it has to

231
00:09:42,259 --> 00:09:46,519
be perfect so yeah we've been there it's

232
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:49,459
it's something that happens but the

233
00:09:49,459 --> 00:09:51,889
thing that really makes me really upset

234
00:09:51,889 --> 00:09:53,329
this one I might you sir because I'm

235
00:09:53,329 --> 00:09:54,889
like you could have done it the other

236
00:09:54,889 --> 00:09:57,290
way and you still chose to do it this or

237
00:09:57,290 --> 00:09:59,870
a terrible way so I'm here more as a

238
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:03,769
user than as a developer so you would

239
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:05,449
not think that this is a solution but

240
00:10:05,449 --> 00:10:07,249
there is a solution and it's making

241
00:10:07,249 --> 00:10:09,110
watches not making apps and I'm just

242
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:13,040
like again captain obvious the things

243
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,499
that the websites like building website

244
00:10:15,499 --> 00:10:18,350
has this almost 30 years old of

245
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:22,639
experience behind so if you cannot be

246
00:10:22,639 --> 00:10:25,610
some breakfast so a framework if you

247
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:28,100
come up with a framework it's not going

248
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:30,649
to have those 30 years of experience and

249
00:10:30,649 --> 00:10:33,559
standards and consensus and discussions

250
00:10:33,559 --> 00:10:36,199
so your framework is not going to last

251
00:10:36,199 --> 00:10:38,749
for longer than the website and I

252
00:10:38,749 --> 00:10:40,459
properly build website is going to last

253
00:10:40,459 --> 00:10:41,839
longer than any type of Griffin would

254
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:44,449
you could possibly build so for example

255
00:10:44,449 --> 00:10:46,429
I want to show you something really cool

256
00:10:46,429 --> 00:10:48,769
which is the first website I can still

257
00:10:48,769 --> 00:10:51,259
open with my current browser can you

258
00:10:51,259 --> 00:10:53,889
imagine opening nobody's browsers like

259
00:10:53,889 --> 00:10:57,529
nobody's websites with current with

260
00:10:57,529 --> 00:10:59,689
these first browser it will be

261
00:10:59,689 --> 00:11:05,209
impossible candle so it's it's really

262
00:11:05,209 --> 00:11:08,839
some food for thought so how do we do

263
00:11:08,839 --> 00:11:10,459
this thing because I'm just like being

264
00:11:10,459 --> 00:11:15,499
angry here so again captain obvious you

265
00:11:15,499 --> 00:11:16,819
need to start by architect in your

266
00:11:16,819 --> 00:11:18,889
content and design in your content so

267
00:11:18,889 --> 00:11:22,309
what is what your users need like you

268
00:11:22,309 --> 00:11:24,199
can't start saying we're going to use

269
00:11:24,199 --> 00:11:25,879
this framework that's not how you start

270
00:11:25,879 --> 00:11:27,319
their content you need to start thinking

271
00:11:27,319 --> 00:11:31,429
about what do they use this name do they

272
00:11:31,429 --> 00:11:35,509
need a single bay web page up maybe they

273
00:11:35,509 --> 00:11:37,339
just need if it's a restaurant sample

274
00:11:37,339 --> 00:11:39,050
many opening times booking form

275
00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:40,730
something like that like that that's the

276
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:41,629
kind of question we should be asking

277
00:11:41,629 --> 00:11:45,110
yourself do I need to load a full

278
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:47,149
templating engine to render a blog or

279
00:11:47,149 --> 00:11:48,350
maybe you could just friended I on your

280
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:50,569
server and cash it forever so you don't

281
00:11:50,569 --> 00:11:52,730
waste energy in the world the kind of

282
00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:57,529
ideas is what I'm going through etc so

283
00:11:57,529 --> 00:11:59,179
once you know what you want to actually

284
00:11:59,179 --> 00:12:00,769
mean I mean this is I'm just saying

285
00:12:00,769 --> 00:12:02,689
about progressive and his men but once

286
00:12:02,689 --> 00:12:04,670
you know what you want to build you just

287
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:07,160
use it smell and turns out that age to

288
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:11,480
my right self has lots of features cool

289
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,429
things the advanced browsers are going

290
00:12:13,429 --> 00:12:16,040
to be nicer to the users but older

291
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:18,470
browsers will be just functional so they

292
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:19,670
don't know as much suggest ignore

293
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:21,709
whatever they don't know about so for

294
00:12:21,709 --> 00:12:24,499
example if you have an anchor and you

295
00:12:24,499 --> 00:12:28,009
say H ref tell lalalala a phone number

296
00:12:28,009 --> 00:12:30,559
if a browser knows about that when you

297
00:12:30,559 --> 00:12:32,480
click on the phone number it will say I

298
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,369
mean if the presonus about and your rind

299
00:12:34,369 --> 00:12:35,899
is in a phone they would be like that

300
00:12:35,899 --> 00:12:37,549
you want to call this number and this is

301
00:12:37,549 --> 00:12:39,619
just extending something that the webmin

302
00:12:39,619 --> 00:12:42,319
readers which is showing you links if

303
00:12:42,319 --> 00:12:45,290
you use pattern in form inputs you can

304
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:47,749
have regular expression validation built

305
00:12:47,749 --> 00:12:48,920
in the forms you don't need to pull a

306
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:51,319
library to do this thing if you use

307
00:12:51,319 --> 00:12:53,449
input time number and you use this thing

308
00:12:53,449 --> 00:12:55,339
in a device like a phone as well which

309
00:12:55,339 --> 00:12:57,319
is like cumbersome to type numbers and

310
00:12:57,319 --> 00:13:00,319
things which is a very small screen it

311
00:13:00,319 --> 00:13:03,920
will bring a special dial kind of like

312
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,019
styling keyboards so you make things

313
00:13:06,019 --> 00:13:08,059
easy for your users in the proper

314
00:13:08,059 --> 00:13:09,799
context so you're kind of like given the

315
00:13:09,799 --> 00:13:11,869
browser hints as to what kind of content

316
00:13:11,869 --> 00:13:14,839
it is and the browser or the user agent

317
00:13:14,839 --> 00:13:17,180
is going to be like okay I'm going

318
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:20,030
to help you do these things and that

319
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:23,150
works when you use XML correctly if you

320
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:25,970
just use diffs and sponge and you don't

321
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:27,980
markup things properly the browser has

322
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:30,140
no clue of what you want to do so it's

323
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:34,790
not going to help you and then CSS this

324
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:38,450
is what we're here for we need to go

325
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:40,910
bottom up a game like it was very cool

326
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:42,650
that Rachel also explained this thing

327
00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:43,940
like you need to start with the most

328
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:46,130
basic browser and I would like to say

329
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:48,500
that every router can be a basic browser

330
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,510
at some point when you don't get all the

331
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:52,610
sites loaded or when something kind of a

332
00:13:52,610 --> 00:13:56,000
mrs. out the load it can become a basic

333
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,240
browser so an even when sometimes you

334
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:03,200
get like a mobile website URL sent to

335
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,730
you that's the computer and there is no

336
00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:06,470
detection or whatsoever you end up with

337
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:08,390
a basic kind of like version of the

338
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:10,250
website so I want to still get proper

339
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:13,010
content so you need to start here and

340
00:14:13,010 --> 00:14:15,170
make sure he did say in default for

341
00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:16,910
those basic browsers like many people

342
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:20,300
just specify the gradient but they don't

343
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:22,940
specify the base background so when you

344
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:25,550
try to use some websites with browsers

345
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:27,380
like opera mini that strip out the

346
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:30,170
complicated CSS properties if you didn't

347
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:33,140
specify the background and the gradient

348
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:35,150
says this is a dark background and the

349
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:37,040
text is like black you can took it like

350
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,320
black over black which is not exactly

351
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:41,780
what you wanted to do so you you're like

352
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:43,340
making things difficult for yourself you

353
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:47,360
didn't just a cascade properly am also

354
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,130
please don't use proprietary prefixes

355
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:50,840
but if you really need to use

356
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,490
preprocessor so you make sure that you

357
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:56,060
don't miss out on any perfect and again

358
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:57,740
these supports if that's something that

359
00:14:57,740 --> 00:14:59,120
you have to learn today please your

360
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,980
support so you don't send things to

361
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:03,470
process that don't understand them and

362
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:06,140
always be learning like the cool thing

363
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:07,700
of CSS is that they seen that is always

364
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:09,800
the same more or less it's not changing

365
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:12,350
a lot so new things that you learn you

366
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:13,880
can use you don't need to forget the

367
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:16,070
things if you're free a new and also if

368
00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:18,530
you understand CSS it's going to be like

369
00:15:18,530 --> 00:15:20,990
great because you are not going to just

370
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:22,610
like copy things from the internet it's

371
00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:23,960
going to be really good because then you

372
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:28,160
can buy things your own so like I guess

373
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:31,070
rewatching Rachel's talk and the count

374
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:32,180
it's going to be really really cool

375
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:34,430
because you can like remember the things

376
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:36,080
that she's been suggesting and like

377
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:39,350
learning really how things like the new

378
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:41,690
things work and just like and learn the

379
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:43,550
new things they all things that we used

380
00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:46,820
to use and this is my special for you we

381
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:50,840
part of ESS ESS developer like your real

382
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:53,150
developer no don't tell don't let people

383
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:54,260
tell you you might have really available

384
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:55,880
because you're just writing JavaScript

385
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,410
like well you know what India is good

386
00:15:57,410 --> 00:15:59,810
you are a real developer and writing

387
00:15:59,810 --> 00:16:03,260
good CSS is really available if you

388
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:05,090
write good size you can have with so

389
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:07,250
many lines of Battier you have a script

390
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:09,170
code and it's going to be all so fast

391
00:16:09,170 --> 00:16:10,610
and more performant because the browser

392
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:14,330
is going to like be like Oh CSS I know

393
00:16:14,330 --> 00:16:15,860
how to the listing and I'm going to be

394
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:17,630
hard we're accelerating days and i'm

395
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:20,210
going to use less energy so that's going

396
00:16:20,210 --> 00:16:22,160
to be better for mobile users which

397
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:25,010
happen to be a lot of people so feel

398
00:16:25,010 --> 00:16:27,020
proud to be CSS developers you aren't

399
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:31,370
great so then when you are like oh yes

400
00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:33,320
some CSS developer when you get to

401
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,060
javascript please be it really wise

402
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:37,370
again the way with great power comes

403
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:40,100
great responsibility Janice can break

404
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:43,220
things really badly so please don't send

405
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:44,660
things the browsers that don't know

406
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:48,170
other things so there is this polyfill

407
00:16:48,170 --> 00:16:50,000
service by the FT they will make sure

408
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,570
that things are like properly like all

409
00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:55,820
the gaps are properly pulley field and

410
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:57,980
you can also configure that so it

411
00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:00,260
doesn't send the whole thing of like the

412
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:02,960
whole list of polyfills this is my

413
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:05,000
personal personal advisors programmer

414
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,980
please use feature libraries or

415
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:08,930
frameworks like maybe you're just going

416
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:11,030
to use a fraction of all the powers not

417
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,920
a framework is offering you so maybe

418
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,209
just try to use the little thing that

419
00:17:14,209 --> 00:17:18,079
you need and if you really master please

420
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:20,510
use frames with axe ability built-in not

421
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:23,300
just like I saw frame with the other day

422
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:26,329
I say oh mobile is not at the top of our

423
00:17:26,329 --> 00:17:27,920
priority it's not what they said I'm

424
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:31,420
like are you from the 90s like seriously

425
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:34,880
and remember that no frames is a silver

426
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,700
bullet like just by choosing booster up

427
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:39,620
or react or whatever you want to use

428
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:40,850
it's not going to sort out your issues

429
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:43,640
like if your content is bound at a time

430
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:46,930
no frameworks going to fix your content

431
00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:50,480
things to watch out for is at tracking

432
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:53,110
and all stuff I interface with browsers

433
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:56,360
it's very interesting to know how to

434
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:58,940
learn how two hours rendering pipeline

435
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:01,040
works and how you know like when

436
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:04,070
resources don't know they how it affects

437
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:06,950
with what the browser is doing how how

438
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:08,510
things are stopped waiting for other

439
00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:10,130
things to parse and accounting and

440
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:11,750
especially if you're going to be

441
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:13,429
inserting apps and things that your boss

442
00:18:13,429 --> 00:18:14,929
is going to tell you how we really need

443
00:18:14,929 --> 00:18:16,490
to track this thing you need to bring

444
00:18:16,490 --> 00:18:19,280
them up like every time you are then

445
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:22,150
beacon this is going to slow things down

446
00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:24,800
so they need to know that when they

447
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,270
don't make money with the website that

448
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:29,380
is a reason behind that so if you could

449
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:32,240
measure things if you have data you can

450
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,040
argue with them every time we add this

451
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,929
thing we have this drop in sales or

452
00:18:35,929 --> 00:18:37,970
whatever so you need data to be able to

453
00:18:37,970 --> 00:18:41,900
remove the crabs later and also watch

454
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:43,760
out for content that we just no display

455
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:47,809
if javascript breaks like for example if

456
00:18:47,809 --> 00:18:50,480
all your content requires loading a big

457
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,250
chunk of JavaScript and parsing the

458
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:54,290
thing it just won't display in basic

459
00:18:54,290 --> 00:18:57,890
browsers so my the crux of this is if

460
00:18:57,890 --> 00:18:59,540
you really want to replace something a

461
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:01,070
browser is doing you better know what

462
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:04,160
you're doing because honestly browsers

463
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,440
are a complicated piece of machinery so

464
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:08,570
the thing is that when you're like young

465
00:19:08,570 --> 00:19:10,460
and ambitious you think you can do

466
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:12,830
better but often that's not the case so

467
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:14,870
the reason the browser is a big thing is

468
00:19:14,870 --> 00:19:18,670
because there is a reason for that so

469
00:19:18,670 --> 00:19:22,400
important this is not like a server-side

470
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,410
conference but this is important as well

471
00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:27,200
and it's like it's not sexy or cool or

472
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,150
whatever and I hate sexy applied to

473
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:32,470
technology but service is important

474
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:35,570
because in basic browsers and in like

475
00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:37,880
all in like all new phones server-side

476
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:40,370
rendering is still faster than every

477
00:19:40,370 --> 00:19:42,500
possible JavaScript improved performance

478
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:45,740
whatever just giving people render HTML

479
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:48,290
and they just they can just like okay I

480
00:19:48,290 --> 00:19:49,670
know how to do this thing where as

481
00:19:49,670 --> 00:19:51,299
everything else that you can put in

482
00:19:51,299 --> 00:19:54,659
way is going to have a very long time

483
00:19:54,659 --> 00:19:57,149
for requests to render and people are

484
00:19:57,149 --> 00:20:00,899
going to abandon their website so and do

485
00:20:00,899 --> 00:20:03,809
you need a thing anyway react lets you

486
00:20:03,809 --> 00:20:05,580
do this I mean the reason people just

487
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:07,230
react is because they can do this it's a

488
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:09,809
morphic JavaScript and serve just in PHP

489
00:20:09,809 --> 00:20:11,249
which is not fashionable anymore

490
00:20:11,249 --> 00:20:12,779
apparently even if it keeps doing the

491
00:20:12,779 --> 00:20:15,629
job and server side validation is a

492
00:20:15,629 --> 00:20:17,549
still require so if you get data from

493
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:19,499
the outside world you need to still

494
00:20:19,499 --> 00:20:22,169
validate so why not do like everything

495
00:20:22,169 --> 00:20:28,289
together again let me stress this server

496
00:20:28,289 --> 00:20:30,929
side validation insisted required you

497
00:20:30,929 --> 00:20:33,029
can't trust people from the outside you

498
00:20:33,029 --> 00:20:34,619
can't trust the people of range of

499
00:20:34,619 --> 00:20:38,100
JavaScript front side up and not getting

500
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:40,049
junk injected because you know a lot of

501
00:20:40,049 --> 00:20:42,480
viruses that can take over browsers and

502
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:45,659
some crap to people through the browser

503
00:20:45,659 --> 00:20:47,399
even if they are affiliated and things

504
00:20:47,399 --> 00:20:50,700
like that so don't trust front end all

505
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:54,419
the time and also in this is very funny

506
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:57,119
but this it's very easy to get gains

507
00:20:57,119 --> 00:20:58,919
from this from checking server

508
00:20:58,919 --> 00:21:01,649
configuration for caching and just also

509
00:21:01,649 --> 00:21:05,279
things like enabling compression I just

510
00:21:05,279 --> 00:21:07,769
work in a place that were said we were

511
00:21:07,769 --> 00:21:09,600
serving like this was before iphone

512
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:13,259
existed and just enabling jzip made us

513
00:21:13,259 --> 00:21:16,440
like super fast like we save so much in

514
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:19,919
bad ways and and I said that it was

515
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:21,749
before the iPhone because my boss have

516
00:21:21,749 --> 00:21:23,730
one of those Nokia's that were super

517
00:21:23,730 --> 00:21:25,649
advanced back in the time and he was

518
00:21:25,649 --> 00:21:28,499
like now I can open this website on the

519
00:21:28,499 --> 00:21:30,090
phone which I couldn't do before because

520
00:21:30,090 --> 00:21:31,919
it was it was just timing out but with

521
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:34,049
jay-z been able it was short enough that

522
00:21:34,049 --> 00:21:36,299
he could just get the whole thing so

523
00:21:36,299 --> 00:21:38,730
it's funny is like just simple easy

524
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:40,139
things you can do and then you get

525
00:21:40,139 --> 00:21:43,409
really good gains I'm also related to

526
00:21:43,409 --> 00:21:46,139
faster transmissions consider HTTP two

527
00:21:46,139 --> 00:21:48,720
is a talk about this later and then you

528
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:52,859
require HTTPS 482 DP 2 and also for

529
00:21:52,859 --> 00:21:54,749
privacy sensitive aph like service

530
00:21:54,749 --> 00:21:56,429
workers on a la la which I'm really

531
00:21:56,429 --> 00:21:59,789
briefly mention later to diagnose you

532
00:21:59,789 --> 00:22:01,490
can use developer tools

533
00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:04,370
the the network panel and you can see

534
00:22:04,370 --> 00:22:07,160
the Heather's have been returned when I

535
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:09,290
don't know what the crew won but the

536
00:22:09,290 --> 00:22:11,000
fire festival to have something where

537
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:15,380
you can see how long it takes how much

538
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:17,150
data you get on the first on the second

539
00:22:17,150 --> 00:22:18,530
request so you can see if things are

540
00:22:18,530 --> 00:22:21,020
being cut properly and of course the web

541
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:24,920
page test and this is how I know imagine

542
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,360
me like a haven't really sled Matt

543
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:29,090
imagine if it's hard but the truth is

544
00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:30,860
I'm writing software is hard no one told

545
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:33,260
you this was like funny what do you is

546
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:36,590
funny but it's her um but at least we'd

547
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:38,900
have to build the browser first in

548
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:41,870
theory that would be very hard and and

549
00:22:41,870 --> 00:22:46,640
the thing again browsers are amazing we

550
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,770
have a Helen in turn this this summer

551
00:22:48,770 --> 00:22:51,559
and he was implementing a feature in

552
00:22:51,559 --> 00:22:53,870
several he was like service a browser i

553
00:22:53,870 --> 00:22:56,840
feels like it's amazing like he was just

554
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:58,670
implementing double-click but just like

555
00:22:58,670 --> 00:23:00,980
we get this kind of like interactions

556
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:02,870
that we don't even think about what

557
00:23:02,870 --> 00:23:04,790
process do so many things for you really

558
00:23:04,790 --> 00:23:08,360
and with Pleakley ignore them for some

559
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:11,360
reason and the list of features is just

560
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,100
growing and growing like all the cool

561
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:15,950
CSS features have been discussing today

562
00:23:15,950 --> 00:23:18,020
like all the ligatures of the grill on

563
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:19,820
flex layout we can do so many great

564
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:21,860
things and we can be so innovative on

565
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:24,890
the web and have all this freedom like

566
00:23:24,890 --> 00:23:26,809
when i started to web development we

567
00:23:26,809 --> 00:23:30,290
have to take images of custom phones and

568
00:23:30,290 --> 00:23:32,480
slice them and i like them in a table

569
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:36,110
and use n & mm BSP elements and take

570
00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:37,309
that I we don't need to do any that

571
00:23:37,309 --> 00:23:39,710
anymore you can be really semantics and

572
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:43,510
very clear on what we mean this is great

573
00:23:43,510 --> 00:23:46,370
we have things like offline support so

574
00:23:46,370 --> 00:23:49,340
you can turn any website and I think

575
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:51,170
that works offline so you don't need to

576
00:23:51,170 --> 00:23:53,120
suffer with like roaming and things just

577
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:55,580
your the directions to your hotel are

578
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:58,340
already in your phone sort of school you

579
00:23:58,340 --> 00:23:59,630
can engage people with push

580
00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:01,309
notifications with service workers as

581
00:24:01,309 --> 00:24:04,280
well you can even install the app if you

582
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:06,860
really are very engaged with this

583
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:09,710
website and with this website because

584
00:24:09,710 --> 00:24:12,200
all this is built on top of a website so

585
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,000
what that means is because the way of

586
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:14,690
brands

587
00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:16,490
work if they understand these things

588
00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:18,830
they are going to offer this option to

589
00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:20,930
you if they don't they are still a

590
00:24:20,930 --> 00:24:23,240
website and they still work so when I

591
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:25,070
hear people saying I'm just not going to

592
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:27,110
support Safari safaris in Hawaii I'm

593
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:31,100
like are you crazy like what about all

594
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:32,870
the iphones and like oh they do super

595
00:24:32,870 --> 00:24:34,190
service workers back but but that

596
00:24:34,190 --> 00:24:36,050
doesn't mean that you have to make your

597
00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:39,590
appt up dependent on just service

598
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:40,850
workers like you can still have a

599
00:24:40,850 --> 00:24:42,470
website it just won't work offline

600
00:24:42,470 --> 00:24:45,080
because you know Safari but the rest

601
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:49,190
should work so that's that's the thing I

602
00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:50,690
want to like converted a like if you

603
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:52,340
build a website you can add more

604
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:54,560
features on top and it's not like an all

605
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:56,960
of nothing like it is with apps like if

606
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:59,840
I make an Android app it's either you

607
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:01,310
have an android phone or you don't have

608
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:05,750
it you can use this up or if then I

609
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:08,300
phone comes with a new version of a kind

610
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:12,530
of hybrid between hi phone and what's

611
00:25:12,530 --> 00:25:15,830
the other thing ipad and then you have

612
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:17,930
to build a version of the app for Daniel

613
00:25:17,930 --> 00:25:20,480
saying that's ridiculous but with a

614
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:23,030
website to just get one thing that works

615
00:25:23,030 --> 00:25:26,840
everywhere and it's like it's totally

616
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:28,400
mind-blowing and I don't understand how

617
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,350
people are so keen on using steel apps

618
00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:34,460
when you have all these great things so

619
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:35,930
it's exciting times the via web

620
00:25:35,930 --> 00:25:39,290
developer and the thing again is that we

621
00:25:39,290 --> 00:25:42,020
can reach so many people like I don't

622
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:43,610
even know how many people in on earth

623
00:25:43,610 --> 00:25:45,380
but there is so many people that already

624
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:46,850
connected to the Internet and the

625
00:25:46,850 --> 00:25:49,280
millions of a common new internet users

626
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:51,290
they are actually not using iPads they

627
00:25:51,290 --> 00:25:52,850
are not using iPhones and they are using

628
00:25:52,850 --> 00:25:54,980
and reader they are using like I mean

629
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:56,990
those fancy androids there is like cheap

630
00:25:56,990 --> 00:25:59,120
android phones and they have like small

631
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:01,280
data plans and they don't want to

632
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:04,850
install app they just want to have their

633
00:26:04,850 --> 00:26:08,210
photos and you know like access websites

634
00:26:08,210 --> 00:26:09,560
because it just don't have a space

635
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:12,890
they're really cheap phones so I'm the

636
00:26:12,890 --> 00:26:14,360
only important thing is that the process

637
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:16,100
they are using you haven't even heard

638
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:19,000
them before because they're like totally

639
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,230
custom things that the couriers are

640
00:26:21,230 --> 00:26:24,320
building and things like like UC browser

641
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,290
which I've never do this because

642
00:26:26,290 --> 00:26:30,520
a bad developer so that's it whole thing

643
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:32,020
like if you build in a way that your

644
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:34,330
prepare for the unknown you are safe if

645
00:26:34,330 --> 00:26:36,130
you're trying to just use things that

646
00:26:36,130 --> 00:26:37,750
you control that you're familiar with

647
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:42,070
your like set for failure and i say i

648
00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:45,610
work at mozilla we love the web so we're

649
00:26:45,610 --> 00:26:47,440
researching exploring the feature of the

650
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,690
web one of the things we're working on

651
00:26:49,690 --> 00:26:52,030
is server which is a new browser it's

652
00:26:52,030 --> 00:26:54,640
parallel say from performant as a new

653
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:57,310
browser engine is Britain in rust the

654
00:26:57,310 --> 00:26:58,960
holidays because it's written in rust

655
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:01,180
it's a very safe language so if there is

656
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:04,990
a crash which is prayer user data should

657
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:06,880
not be put in the insurance so people

658
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,950
cannot steal your back credentials and

659
00:27:08,950 --> 00:27:10,570
things like that and the other cool

660
00:27:10,570 --> 00:27:13,120
aspect of rest is that is very parallel

661
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:15,910
by default so we are trying to make sure

662
00:27:15,910 --> 00:27:18,310
that we are using all the of the

663
00:27:18,310 --> 00:27:21,850
hardware in mobile browsers which means

664
00:27:21,850 --> 00:27:25,810
that so mobile browsers have more course

665
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:29,500
but each course is lower so normal kind

666
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:30,970
of like traditional browsers are

667
00:27:30,970 --> 00:27:32,770
designed for mono Corps maybe a graphics

668
00:27:32,770 --> 00:27:34,480
card and the problem is that that's not

669
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,460
very efficient in mobile browsers so

670
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:38,260
with several we're trying to build a new

671
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:40,420
thing from the ground up that uses all

672
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:42,130
the course in phones and it's way more

673
00:27:42,130 --> 00:27:43,870
efficient because you can use things in

674
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:46,690
parallel so we can do things like web

675
00:27:46,690 --> 00:27:49,210
render which is a new CSS engine that

676
00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:51,490
makes things like which for this you can

677
00:27:51,490 --> 00:27:53,680
use left and you can just stop and there

678
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:55,210
is no performance issue with that it's

679
00:27:55,210 --> 00:27:57,970
amazing you don't need to be thinking

680
00:27:57,970 --> 00:28:00,340
about oh I need to use translate instead

681
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:02,920
of left because left is not going to be

682
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:05,020
fast enough so with web render you can

683
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:06,640
ignore the thing and the other good

684
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,530
thing we're doing is we're taking things

685
00:28:08,530 --> 00:28:10,150
from said well I'm moving them into

686
00:28:10,150 --> 00:28:12,880
Firefox so we can have like the feature

687
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:15,340
in the present so we're probably

688
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:17,410
starting with some parts of the URL

689
00:28:17,410 --> 00:28:20,620
parsing which is a huge factor for

690
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:23,260
attacks like there are many good level

691
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:26,230
never abilities that are due to during

692
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:27,760
parsing so we're taking things like that

693
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:30,520
web render is possibly one of the things

694
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:33,240
that is coming to the Firefox soon

695
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:36,100
because obviously we want to make CSS as

696
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:37,930
fast as possible so you and even need to

697
00:28:37,930 --> 00:28:38,659
one there

698
00:28:38,659 --> 00:28:42,979
is going to be bad or slow we want

699
00:28:42,979 --> 00:28:45,049
people to just bright normal CSS is

700
00:28:45,049 --> 00:28:47,359
having to think about what the browser

701
00:28:47,359 --> 00:28:49,609
has to do to render this thing is it

702
00:28:49,609 --> 00:28:51,340
going to be bad as you can to be slow

703
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:54,200
and more things that don't make any

704
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,820
sense in this conference because this is

705
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:58,789
a purely JavaScript sub thanks and I'll

706
00:28:58,789 --> 00:29:00,379
be around probably having more coffee

707
00:29:00,379 --> 00:29:02,629
because I'm like starting to feel

708
00:29:02,629 --> 00:29:06,879
strange I think I've been really fast

709
00:29:06,879 --> 00:29:10,999
but not sure time is very elastic from

710
00:29:10,999 --> 00:29:13,729
me right now all right thank you sort of

711
00:29:13,729 --> 00:29:17,899
that it's a very great talk about making

712
00:29:17,899 --> 00:29:20,330
websites and not applications and just

713
00:29:20,330 --> 00:29:22,669
reminding all of us not to ignore all

714
00:29:22,669 --> 00:29:23,960
the different things that we have in our

715
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:27,529
browsers and skip to the app and feel

716
00:29:27,529 --> 00:29:30,229
that it's all the best thing out the

717
00:29:30,229 --> 00:29:31,999
process still the best and by the way

718
00:29:31,999 --> 00:29:34,489
how many CSS developers here give me a

719
00:29:34,489 --> 00:29:42,649
raise of your hands CSS FTW all right

720
00:29:42,649 --> 00:29:46,999
I'm before any questions for some of

721
00:29:46,999 --> 00:29:51,799
that I shall take the money and run the

722
00:29:51,799 --> 00:29:54,830
round if you have any questions come on

723
00:29:54,830 --> 00:30:01,159
come on all right I see someone's

724
00:30:01,159 --> 00:30:04,940
scratching ahead all right all right so

725
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:07,249
if there are no questions I'll have one

726
00:30:07,249 --> 00:30:09,619
question to up oh okay all right there's

727
00:30:09,619 --> 00:30:12,379
so many things in browsers nowadays like

728
00:30:12,379 --> 00:30:15,639
just like so much force taking right now

729
00:30:15,639 --> 00:30:19,609
so how do you even begin learning of

730
00:30:19,609 --> 00:30:21,379
this stuff like what would be a proper

731
00:30:21,379 --> 00:30:24,649
roadmap for someone who is new to the

732
00:30:24,649 --> 00:30:26,989
web different browsers how will you

733
00:30:26,989 --> 00:30:29,629
recommend for us to learn all the stuff

734
00:30:29,629 --> 00:30:32,149
out there is a very good question and I

735
00:30:32,149 --> 00:30:33,590
would like to know how to answer the

736
00:30:33,590 --> 00:30:37,759
property we have the Mozilla developer

737
00:30:37,759 --> 00:30:41,720
Network which is the documentation site

738
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:44,149
we are trying to write guides for

739
00:30:44,149 --> 00:30:46,879
developers who are new because most of

740
00:30:46,879 --> 00:30:48,620
the content they can find em

741
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:52,130
how to write xml is from the 90s or the

742
00:30:52,130 --> 00:30:54,650
2000s and it's like it doesn't really

743
00:30:54,650 --> 00:30:56,930
have good practices anymore so we're

744
00:30:56,930 --> 00:30:59,780
trying to write new guides which are

745
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:02,500
more like more than worth development I

746
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:04,820
think someone told me that code Academy

747
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:07,880
was really great for them but my problem

748
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:09,350
is that i started doing web development

749
00:31:09,350 --> 00:31:13,850
in 1996 so I'm like I know it's natural

750
00:31:13,850 --> 00:31:16,880
to me so yeah maybe I should just speak

751
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:19,070
to more beginners so I can understand

752
00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:20,600
that paint better but yeah we're trying

753
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:23,990
in developer mozilla org she'll have

754
00:31:23,990 --> 00:31:35,660
content for beginners
