1
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:18,340

so as I said how to get rich quick with

2
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:24,820
JavaScript so present to you a new

3
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:28,930
JavaScript framework and together with

4
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:34,090
it an opportunity for you hello it has

5
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:38,920
all kinds of features so it has XM l HX

6
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:45,850
SQL it even has Wi-Fi and it's licensed

7
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:49,210
/ app so you pay fifty thousand euros

8
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:51,749
per app that you create with it and

9
00:00:51,749 --> 00:00:55,960
peruse it as uses the framework another

10
00:00:55,960 --> 00:01:01,539
five euros pretty cheap so we make a

11
00:01:01,539 --> 00:01:07,000
7030 split so that means you just create

12
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,400
one app that has 100,000 users and your

13
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,940
have almost half a million euros cool

14
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:21,040
right wait a minute what come with this

15
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:25,330
is or to put it more bluntly what the

16
00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:29,080
hell are you talking about okay I have a

17
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:33,640
confession to make I lied so this

18
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:37,000
doesn't really exist but imagine it

19
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,120
would exist in this parallel world where

20
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,920
our tools that we use to create

21
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,650
applications would be licensed for

22
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:47,220
device or per app or even for users

23
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:49,420
imagining for a moment if you used

24
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:51,670
phonegap and you had to pay let's say

25
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:54,280
100,000 years to use phonegap per app

26
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:57,820
just imagine it for a while that's not

27
00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:03,030
that wouldn't be a nice world right

28
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:06,430
instead we have a wonderful world where

29
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:11,980
you actually have free tools and even

30
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:15,390
more you have ecosystems that are

31
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:17,940
created and enabled by those free tools

32
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:22,720
think back of all those great projects

33
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,850
we have we have no look at the ecosystem

34
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:27,819
around node look at the one around

35
00:02:27,819 --> 00:02:28,750
jQuery

36
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:31,600
our own annual around phonegap look how

37
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:40,330
much we have there so just back about me

38
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:43,300
I work in the webos and annual develop

39
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:49,300
relations and i love the web I love

40
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:55,870
communities and also mobile so this is

41
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:59,470
about the tools that we use to create

42
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:02,650
our software and it's worthwhile to go

43
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:09,100
back and see how did we get here so go

44
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:11,320
back to the age of Metro works Borland

45
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:13,750
Clarion and so on I was actually when I

46
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:15,760
think he works for used to work for

47
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,340
metal works back in the days those were

48
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:22,830
sold to and used to buy specialists

49
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:28,209
they're pretty expensive 3,000 euros for

50
00:03:28,209 --> 00:03:31,270
professional license or if you were

51
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:32,890
lucky enough to be a hobbyist you might

52
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:37,209
you might have only to pay 200 years

53
00:03:37,209 --> 00:03:39,760
maybe that's actually cut off as he did

54
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,010
expensive tools and only used by

55
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:48,100
specialists and those were closed tools

56
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:51,030
no open source proprietary licensing

57
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:56,019
which meant that writing software was

58
00:03:56,019 --> 00:03:59,049
limited to those specialists and also

59
00:03:59,049 --> 00:04:01,900
you had to actually find a fan so on to

60
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:04,150
you have to pay someone to ride you the

61
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:05,920
software I don't think anyone would just

62
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,299
go out and say let's spend three

63
00:04:07,299 --> 00:04:09,549
thousand euros on software so i can do

64
00:04:09,549 --> 00:04:14,530
stuff and as we marched on in time this

65
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:16,299
also led to a kind of when door locking

66
00:04:16,299 --> 00:04:19,299
where we just said okay this is truly

67
00:04:19,299 --> 00:04:21,370
this is how you have to use this you

68
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:22,840
have to update it to get the latest

69
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:30,240
feature fevers forward we started

70
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:34,300
packing the time if you remember in the

71
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:36,310
browser Wars time Netscape versus in the

72
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:41,119
next floor where the web started to rise

73
00:04:41,129 --> 00:04:45,519
and you might remember the attempt to

74
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:48,579
control this open web to make it

75
00:04:48,579 --> 00:04:50,229
proprietor again we met do you remember

76
00:04:50,229 --> 00:04:53,379
activex back in the days so luckily we

77
00:04:53,379 --> 00:04:59,399
didn't and we didn't stay in that age

78
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:01,360
because what actually happened was a

79
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,449
devil creation of the web the creation

80
00:05:04,449 --> 00:05:08,610
of software for the web websites those

81
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:11,379
shifted from the specialists which they

82
00:05:11,379 --> 00:05:13,559
were created in beginning to everyone

83
00:05:13,559 --> 00:05:18,279
everyone was able to create a website to

84
00:05:18,279 --> 00:05:22,869
create software for the web what

85
00:05:22,869 --> 00:05:25,569
happened the web was open source by

86
00:05:25,569 --> 00:05:28,929
design it had built in a really cool

87
00:05:28,929 --> 00:05:32,799
tool which was hidden in many on her and

88
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:36,009
view source so you could actually view

89
00:05:36,009 --> 00:05:41,689
the source of every website you visited

90
00:05:41,699 --> 00:05:45,639
this led to communities this led to open

91
00:05:45,639 --> 00:05:49,529
exchange where people shared their

92
00:05:49,529 --> 00:05:52,349
experiences thanks to view source

93
00:05:52,349 --> 00:05:54,969
because then you said well I have

94
00:05:54,969 --> 00:05:56,649
nothing to hide here's my code look at

95
00:05:56,649 --> 00:06:03,879
it look how I made it this led the web

96
00:06:03,879 --> 00:06:07,509
to become an ecosystem where we exchange

97
00:06:07,509 --> 00:06:11,229
information where we created tools built

98
00:06:11,229 --> 00:06:13,389
on the web where we created services

99
00:06:13,389 --> 00:06:20,139
built on the web it also meant that he

100
00:06:20,139 --> 00:06:22,809
no longer had to be an expert to program

101
00:06:22,809 --> 00:06:25,449
the barrier of entry for programmer was

102
00:06:25,449 --> 00:06:28,689
really low if you look at HTML CSS CSS

103
00:06:28,689 --> 00:06:30,279
and JavaScript and how they were

104
00:06:30,279 --> 00:06:35,019
standardized so many people could write

105
00:06:35,019 --> 00:06:40,749
software the development tools were

106
00:06:40,749 --> 00:06:44,019
basically free all that you needed was a

107
00:06:44,019 --> 00:06:46,809
text editor and the browser which both

108
00:06:46,809 --> 00:06:49,810
were free and available

109
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:55,270
even in source it around the same time

110
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:57,700
we also saw that the infrastructure that

111
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:59,440
built the web was starting to become

112
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:03,070
open source languages operating systems

113
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:06,820
databases web servers all this start to

114
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:12,790
become open source so let's fast forward

115
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:17,980
today to today we are in the age of

116
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:23,919
mobile clearly if you look at it re in

117
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:26,350
the war of browsers again second coming

118
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:28,000
well it's probably more a war of

119
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,030
ecosystems where we have everyone tried

120
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:36,100
to lock them into their world Apple

121
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:41,620
Google Microsoft and so on what's the

122
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:46,990
role of the web in this mobile first we

123
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:49,120
have the evolution of HTML CSS and

124
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,340
JavaScript which we collect if you call

125
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:53,830
html5 but we also have this epic you

126
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:56,380
ubiquiti we have all kinds of connected

127
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:58,870
devices all over the place that can

128
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:02,110
access the web and on the other hand we

129
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:03,729
also have this expectation of people

130
00:08:03,729 --> 00:08:06,340
let's say I just want to access my

131
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:09,880
content my data anywhere peed in the car

132
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:15,100
on the phone at home the role of

133
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:17,560
JavaScript also in mobile it's important

134
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,360
it's a big bootys every browser ships

135
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,610
with JavaScript and as we say I already

136
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:26,470
saw every device has a browser it has

137
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:28,270
even moved to the server so we have

138
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:29,590
client and server with the same language

139
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:36,729
and it's easy to learn which leads us to

140
00:08:36,729 --> 00:08:39,610
native vs web so I have to talk about it

141
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:42,039
a bit I know it's like beating a dead

142
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:44,920
horse I will do it anyway but i'll try

143
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,839
to approach it bit from another

144
00:08:46,839 --> 00:08:51,220
direction so my question is what if the

145
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:54,610
web what if web is native water if there

146
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:57,130
is no distinction between web and native

147
00:08:57,130 --> 00:08:59,380
if you look at projects like Weber's

148
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:01,120
chrome eyes forever folks always that we

149
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,959
saw today there the web is native

150
00:09:03,959 --> 00:09:07,540
what if all out our Epsom are on the web

151
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:09,790
are we stick are we still talking about

152
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:15,549
native 10 and also brings me to another

153
00:09:15,549 --> 00:09:21,220
topic eps must die why are we stuck in

154
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:24,339
this why do we like back in the

155
00:09:24,339 --> 00:09:26,980
mainframes mainframe days start an

156
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:31,899
application to do something why don't we

157
00:09:31,899 --> 00:09:34,689
do more just in time interaction for

158
00:09:34,689 --> 00:09:37,029
example i want to interact with

159
00:09:37,029 --> 00:09:40,059
something p the device or a service so i

160
00:09:40,059 --> 00:09:41,619
have to go ahead and download and it's

161
00:09:41,619 --> 00:09:43,359
still gonna install an app that specific

162
00:09:43,359 --> 00:09:45,549
for that device then i use the app and

163
00:09:45,549 --> 00:09:47,169
then I probably don't use it anymore I

164
00:09:47,169 --> 00:09:49,149
forget about it and then after a while I

165
00:09:49,149 --> 00:09:54,369
have after have after I've used every

166
00:09:54,369 --> 00:09:58,089
service or every place on this world I

167
00:09:58,089 --> 00:10:00,040
will have 1000 apps installed and I

168
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,600
don't even know which one I have to

169
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:05,199
start anymore why do we do this where

170
00:10:05,199 --> 00:10:09,939
will this end up so what about I want to

171
00:10:09,939 --> 00:10:11,319
interact with something I have an

172
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:12,970
automated discovery that finds out

173
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:16,239
what's out there it will serve me a web

174
00:10:16,239 --> 00:10:18,549
based app I use it or interact with that

175
00:10:18,549 --> 00:10:21,359
I forget about it and it's gone and

176
00:10:21,359 --> 00:10:24,100
thanks to the weapon thanks to all the

177
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:25,899
infrastructure that's open will have

178
00:10:25,899 --> 00:10:30,730
rickety this is getting with on top of

179
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:33,759
topic so let's go back to the

180
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:40,359
development tools that we have today in

181
00:10:40,359 --> 00:10:42,189
mobile development in mobile negative

182
00:10:42,189 --> 00:10:45,039
development we have three tools you

183
00:10:45,039 --> 00:10:46,480
don't have to pay for the development

184
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,029
tools with xcode eclipse and so on and

185
00:10:49,029 --> 00:10:55,660
so on or also a visual studio but are

186
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:58,089
they really only an entry into an

187
00:10:58,089 --> 00:10:59,889
ecosystem of the mouth of the

188
00:10:59,889 --> 00:11:03,339
manufacture their free as beer but

189
00:11:03,339 --> 00:11:06,160
they're really to really do they really

190
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:12,090
give you freedom think about

191
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:15,220
in web development most tools are open

192
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:19,029
source and I mean that in a way of free

193
00:11:19,029 --> 00:11:25,569
and freedom as I mentioned before alo we

194
00:11:25,569 --> 00:11:27,550
have a really low barrier of entry for

195
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:30,250
new programs they can go and start with

196
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:33,370
javascript HTML and CSS as and we have

197
00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:39,970
the browser and JavaScript everywhere we

198
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:42,699
have a lot of communities around those

199
00:11:42,699 --> 00:11:46,329
products around the web and just

200
00:11:46,329 --> 00:11:48,459
interesting to see good communities that

201
00:11:48,459 --> 00:11:51,670
form orpha our founded on mutual respect

202
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:56,470
by the entity that puts out the tool and

203
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:58,389
the ones that use it because for both it

204
00:11:58,389 --> 00:12:02,550
means respect each other and also

205
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:06,339
voluntary engagement if I use it or even

206
00:12:06,339 --> 00:12:11,980
if I commit a code to the project also

207
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:15,339
these days if you don't have a tool with

208
00:12:15,339 --> 00:12:17,829
a strong community I don't think it has

209
00:12:17,829 --> 00:12:25,600
much relevant anymore so with all that

210
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,490
in web development the free tool

211
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:34,089
ecosystem is key so back to the

212
00:12:34,089 --> 00:12:38,350
beginning one app 100,000 users easy

213
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:42,639
four hundred thousand euros but now used

214
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:46,000
you came here to find out how you get

215
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:53,529
rich where's the money the role of tools

216
00:12:53,529 --> 00:12:59,800
and frameworks is shifting they are

217
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:03,639
shifting to become an enabler so instead

218
00:13:03,639 --> 00:13:09,060
of just selling a tool you're using it

219
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:13,410
to sell services enabled by those tools

220
00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:18,819
and we also see that a framework or tool

221
00:13:18,819 --> 00:13:21,130
becomes more than just the framework or

222
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:23,439
tool because you start to offer support

223
00:13:23,439 --> 00:13:25,750
and consulting you might

224
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:27,940
even offer and integrate the development

225
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:29,530
environment together with the tool or

226
00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:31,690
even a build environment think of phone

227
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:34,750
get built for example or you might offer

228
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:37,810
cloud api's that enable to do more with

229
00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:41,380
a framework or a tool so this is where

230
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:47,080
you can make the money let's look at

231
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:52,510
some ecosystems as an example i will

232
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:55,300
look at three of them phonegap in your

233
00:13:55,300 --> 00:14:01,180
our own and jquery the ecosystem around

234
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:05,050
phonegap is consulting and also lots of

235
00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:07,510
services on top and for phonegap just

236
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:11,200
look how how it has enabled us to write

237
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:14,490
applications and look how many big-name

238
00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:16,900
committers we have that contribute to

239
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:18,850
the code is that here is the codec you

240
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:20,770
can use it and we give it to free to the

241
00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:24,250
project now think about it if they had

242
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:28,450
said let's charge 100,000 for for using

243
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:30,490
phonegap what would have happened

244
00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:32,620
nothing it would disappear no one would

245
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:40,030
use it let's talk about our own

246
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:43,270
framework this is a sponsored slide so

247
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:46,900
you might not know what it is it's a

248
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:49,660
JavaScript framework called any ojs it

249
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:52,810
was open source in 2012 it uses the

250
00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:55,210
Apache License so it is free as in beer

251
00:14:55,210 --> 00:14:58,510
and also in freedom and its goal to

252
00:14:58,510 --> 00:15:00,490
build native like applications with

253
00:15:00,490 --> 00:15:04,960
JavaScript across platforms I invite you

254
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:07,570
to check it out this ends the sponsored

255
00:15:07,570 --> 00:15:11,830
slide here again what's the ecosystem

256
00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:15,339
about around that new tool why should hv

257
00:15:15,339 --> 00:15:18,190
and not say well let's charge just that

258
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:21,550
much for the license and that's it no

259
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:25,960
again we say it's open source and it's

260
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:29,170
an enable for us to provide services and

261
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:32,170
also even more important it will enable

262
00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:34,180
other companies to build services and

263
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:37,680
applications based on nu

264
00:15:37,690 --> 00:15:40,070
there is also already a big community

265
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:42,160
around it where people for example

266
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:45,230
submit their component components that

267
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:48,350
they made for Nu and I again I have to

268
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:50,300
ask if you would go ahead and say yeah

269
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:53,000
you to use it you have to license every

270
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,020
up you can read you have to pay that

271
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:56,390
much I would work you wouldn't use it I

272
00:15:56,390 --> 00:16:02,600
wouldn't use it jquery which is a bit in

273
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,340
all the project just look what we have

274
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:06,650
in terms of jquery how how big the

275
00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:08,690
ecosystem is we have jQuery jQuery

276
00:16:08,690 --> 00:16:11,540
Mobile jQuery UI we have thousands of

277
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:14,810
plugins we have theming services again d

278
00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:17,960
the ecosystem around this is mostly on

279
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:20,390
consulting and services built with on

280
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:24,500
the top of jQuery again if they would

281
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,270
have decided back then i think it was in

282
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:28,760
2006 to charge for it what would have

283
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:30,740
happened i don't think people would use

284
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:35,900
it and look how much it's used these

285
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:37,790
days in how many applications in how

286
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:44,540
many websites so to wrap up a bit

287
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:48,470
ecosystems by freedom it's there is so

288
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:50,420
much more value than just selling a tool

289
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:52,880
you could say ok let's sell the tool

290
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,560
will probably sell it to that many

291
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:57,380
people will make that much money if you

292
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:59,030
give you the way for free and let it

293
00:16:59,030 --> 00:17:01,910
enable other people just look at the

294
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:04,150
value of that is so much bigger than

295
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:07,310
just telling it and it's also

296
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:10,070
interesting to see we'll have probably

297
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:12,590
have not in network effects the more

298
00:17:12,590 --> 00:17:15,650
people use it and the most people i will

299
00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:17,150
create services and this will increase

300
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:25,160
the value even more so i urge you to

301
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:27,290
keep the web development ecosystem free

302
00:17:27,290 --> 00:17:30,110
and in freedom open source all the

303
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:36,740
things love the web javascript and be
