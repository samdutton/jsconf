[Music]

2
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:19,230
so welcome to this talk on the future of

3
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:25,920
JavaScript is AI my name is my quick was

4
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:26,960
broken

5
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,480
my name is Aston Husain you can find me

6
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,829
on Twitter as draw eight not Jewish a

7
00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:38,340
jaw ache I blog about angular and

8
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:42,800
JavaScript on my website code Croft TV

9
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:46,680
and I'm also a a cloud advocate at

10
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:49,710
Microsoft so if you don't know who we

11
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:52,559
are we are the open source advocates

12
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:55,829
working on the azure cloud platform if

13
00:00:55,829 --> 00:00:57,629
you go to our get a link there you'll

14
00:00:57,629 --> 00:00:59,640
find a you find all of us basically

15
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,680
there's me in the top there the world we

16
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,040
focus on all different technologies and

17
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:07,740
areas my focus is JavaScript and and web

18
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:10,140
well actually I've gone into leadership

19
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:13,170
now so my focus is people but yeah if

20
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:14,400
you want to find out more about us grow

21
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,330
into that website and just yeah chase

22
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:21,270
people up um I also work with a charity

23
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:25,049
called pal internship and what they do

24
00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:27,890
is they help find Palestinians

25
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:30,600
internships in high-tech Israeli

26
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:34,049
startups and I last year I I mentored

27
00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:36,450
about 10 of them it's a really hard work

28
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:38,880
mentoring ten people by mentor ten of

29
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,200
them and this year I'm very very proud

30
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:44,130
to say that seventeen of the interns are

31
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:47,159
all being mentored by one God advocate

32
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:51,479
for Microsoft so if any of you work with

33
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:55,740
or for or at a startup or high tech

34
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:57,420
company in Israel and you have a space

35
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:00,180
or opening for an intern give me a shout

36
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:02,520
I'll connect you in with your program

37
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:06,850
director I can get the ball rolling

38
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:08,580
anybody here

39
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:12,780
anybody here know about udemy anybody

40
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:16,560
here my students on udemy one how I

41
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:21,800
thank you thank you pays my mortgage on

42
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:25,050
udemy like this I get over a year ago

43
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:29,780
now they added in automatic subtitling

44
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:35,370
and so they correctly sites up the spell

45
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:37,610
my name correctly

46
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:43,500
my name is awesome and this talk should

47
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:44,370
be very awesome

48
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:48,720
I also co-organized a meetup group in

49
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:52,260
London called AI JavaScript London

50
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:54,090
psycho organized with my friend L and a

51
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:57,600
half prof. and we started early last

52
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:00,210
year it's been running very successful

53
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:03,980
thing got about 1700 1800 members now

54
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:07,080
and we run some pre regular sessions or

55
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,540
all the way through last year and what

56
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:11,010
happened was at the end of these

57
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:12,900
sessions people would come up to us and

58
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:15,240
it kind of give us a link to some hey

59
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:18,300
look at this javascript a I powered

60
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:21,240
JavaScript application isn't it cool and

61
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,440
we thought you know it's fantastic it's

62
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,270
really cool let's put them all together

63
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:27,240
in a website so everybody else can find

64
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,320
them and that's what we did we made a

65
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:31,980
website called a ijs rocks and if you go

66
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:33,750
to a ijs rocks what you'll find is a

67
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:36,959
whole collection of a I powered

68
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:40,020
JavaScript applications now they're

69
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:41,459
JavaScript and they're in the web which

70
00:03:41,459 --> 00:03:43,470
means you can play around them but also

71
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:45,180
means you can usually view source and

72
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:47,160
see how it's working but the very least

73
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,870
they'll come up with or have a link to

74
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:52,650
the source code or an article or a video

75
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:54,750
explaining how it was made and the idea

76
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:57,990
is to inspire you with an application

77
00:03:57,990 --> 00:04:00,570
and then if you like it you can dig into

78
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:02,070
and learn a little bit more and learn a

79
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:03,510
little bit more and that's that's been

80
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:06,540
my journey into machine learning and

81
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:09,150
jobs has been has been that process I

82
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:11,340
recommend doing that yourself and in

83
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:12,480
this talk today what we're going to do

84
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,040
is we're going to go through three of

85
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:17,220
the applications which you can find on a

86
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:19,020
ijs rocks I'm gonna explain how they

87
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:20,260
work

88
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,880
and then hopefully through that whole

89
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,290
process you're gonna learn throughout

90
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:24,730
the course of today for the course of

91
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:27,610
this lecture talk you're gonna learn a

92
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:28,810
little bit more a little bit more a

93
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:29,920
little bit more about what's possible

94
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:32,890
and achievable with AI machine learning

95
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:34,540
in JavaScript right now I know a couple

96
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:37,600
of talks already in this conference on

97
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,700
this topics

98
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:43,140
I suppose my talk if I'm a higher level

99
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:45,070
give you a bit more of a broader

100
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:47,770
viewpoint of what's possible so let's

101
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:48,960
start off with the first application

102
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:53,830
it's called the moji fire it's not

103
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:58,210
trademarked it's just the moji fire so

104
00:04:58,210 --> 00:05:01,090
it made sense and this is actually my

105
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:04,600
application I built this application and

106
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:08,660
it's going to change everything

107
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:12,430
what does it do you can give an image it

108
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:17,050
will detect any faces in the image it

109
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:19,900
will then detect the emotion in the face

110
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:23,880
it will then any guesses

111
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:27,030
it will mode you fire it

112
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:30,730
that's right we'll grab the appropriate

113
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:33,520
Modi stick on the face and post it right

114
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:38,200
back at you yeah Elon Musk so nothing on

115
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:43,750
me yeah yeah I am open for investment

116
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:46,360
I hear Singapore's a start-up hotspot

117
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:50,260
you can use it may different ways so you

118
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:52,270
can use it as a slack application so in

119
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:55,060
fact if you go to the moji fire calm and

120
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:56,710
you just click that add to slack button

121
00:05:56,710 --> 00:05:58,030
it'll add it to your own slack

122
00:05:58,030 --> 00:06:01,680
workspaces right now and this that works

123
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,600
so you basically find them image this is

124
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:09,760
my son slash mode if I put the pasty

125
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:13,900
image in yeah I see it can handle

126
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:17,500
multiple people so if you grab that one

127
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:22,450
in there we go that back there am i and

128
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:26,680
I it answers an age-old question that

129
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:29,980
has been plaguing people for hunt day go

130
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:33,280
that's the Mona Lisa smile there you go

131
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,750
so the moji fire does quite a lot is a

132
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:37,610
whole lot of things that it's doing but

133
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:39,020
i say the most impressive thing that

134
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:42,259
it's doing is its how the hell is it

135
00:06:42,259 --> 00:06:45,680
calculating emotion emotion right it's

136
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,600
kind of kind of complex things a lot of

137
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,910
us can't really tell other people's

138
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:52,009
emotion but how is a computer figuring

139
00:06:52,009 --> 00:06:55,070
that out right and I've got good news

140
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:58,100
for you it's really easy it's incredibly

141
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:02,240
easy so we got two steps just two steps

142
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:05,990
okay first step detecting the facial

143
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:07,220
features we know how to do this now

144
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:09,680
we've examined in our faces we know the

145
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,900
different points that every single face

146
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:14,630
has and so basically there's death

147
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:17,560
different algorithms that you can get

148
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:21,560
some of them are very arithmetic and

149
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,919
some of them are a little bit more

150
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:25,729
machine learning based essentially

151
00:07:25,729 --> 00:07:27,470
there's lots of different algorithms you

152
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:30,949
can use which can if given an image will

153
00:07:30,949 --> 00:07:33,380
extract for you those facial features in

154
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:35,389
every single face has one of those

155
00:07:35,389 --> 00:07:37,330
features

156
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:41,449
if I step one and step two is really

157
00:07:41,449 --> 00:07:44,120
really easy you just use and you're all

158
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:47,419
networks I said just two steps extract

159
00:07:47,419 --> 00:07:49,669
the features and then just train and use

160
00:07:49,669 --> 00:07:54,440
and you all network let's move on I want

161
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:57,800
to explain you know just just for this

162
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,220
guy

163
00:07:58,220 --> 00:07:59,780
gentleman I'll explain in your network

164
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:00,889
just for just for him over there I

165
00:08:00,889 --> 00:08:03,289
nobody else knows what they are now

166
00:08:03,289 --> 00:08:06,460
but neural network is has a basis in

167
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:10,880
biology okay this is a neuron you should

168
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:14,479
have at least one of these maybe some of

169
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:17,900
you have a few less then you did

170
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:21,680
yesterday but it has some dendrites

171
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:29,630
going in a body a body and some axon

172
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:31,729
going out if enough electricity flows

173
00:08:31,729 --> 00:08:34,729
into the dendrite the body fires some

174
00:08:34,729 --> 00:08:36,529
electricity out through an axon that's

175
00:08:36,529 --> 00:08:37,630
it

176
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:40,490
so it does if you stick enough of these

177
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:44,750
together you get a brain I can think

178
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:47,139
right that's it that's in your network

179
00:08:47,139 --> 00:08:52,850
that's awful that's a brainer to say if

180
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:54,879
I asked you to code this up in

181
00:08:54,879 --> 00:08:58,430
JavaScript you probably kind of try and

182
00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:01,129
give it a go I mean a long time so I've

183
00:09:01,129 --> 00:09:02,449
kind of studied there the computer

184
00:09:02,449 --> 00:09:04,550
science basics right now but I still

185
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:05,529
remember some of it

186
00:09:05,529 --> 00:09:10,339
I've grown node ah I'd create some edges

187
00:09:10,339 --> 00:09:12,439
hi graph theory yeah I know I'm talking

188
00:09:12,439 --> 00:09:14,860
about get some edges going in an edge

189
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:18,110
going back out and then what your

190
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:19,310
features what are the things you're

191
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:20,959
you're pumping into would you would you

192
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:22,459
was the input some what's the output

193
00:09:22,459 --> 00:09:24,740
let's say this neural network is very

194
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:27,470
one your neural network you're going to

195
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:31,750
pump in the day of the year

196
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:38,139
23 and maybe the temperature on that day

197
00:09:38,139 --> 00:09:40,790
that's the inputs then for each of the

198
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:44,930
edges you basically create a random

199
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:47,360
number you initialize with a random

200
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,279
number where math dot R and maybe that

201
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:51,740
got initializers minus 0.5 maybe that's

202
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:56,000
got 2.1 you multiply them together you

203
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,439
add them up when you pump them through

204
00:09:57,439 --> 00:10:00,589
an activation function again whatever

205
00:10:00,589 --> 00:10:02,779
that function pumps out that's

206
00:10:02,779 --> 00:10:05,629
electricity going back out that's how

207
00:10:05,629 --> 00:10:08,540
you would simulate that in code that's

208
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:11,870
it just to see a little bit more about

209
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:13,449
how that might work

210
00:10:13,449 --> 00:10:18,559
boom just this this is it some input

211
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:21,339
features multiply them by the weights

212
00:10:21,339 --> 00:10:23,959
you sum them together whatever that

213
00:10:23,959 --> 00:10:25,639
number is you pass into the activation

214
00:10:25,639 --> 00:10:27,829
function and whatever that pumps out you

215
00:10:27,829 --> 00:10:30,470
pump out that's just in your on it's all

216
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:32,899
you're doing when I when I teach if some

217
00:10:32,899 --> 00:10:36,379
of you coming to my workshop later on at

218
00:10:36,379 --> 00:10:43,769
some point of workshop will just be like

219
00:10:43,779 --> 00:10:45,559
that's what that's what it's all about

220
00:10:45,559 --> 00:10:48,980
right but basically there's loads

221
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:50,329
different activation functions out there

222
00:10:50,329 --> 00:10:52,639
this is a very very simple one anything

223
00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:54,709
below zero is zero anything above zero

224
00:10:54,709 --> 00:10:55,950
is one there's loads

225
00:10:55,950 --> 00:10:59,370
you can use and basically you just grab

226
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:01,940
a bunch of those neurons together

227
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:04,590
okay Network there's a simple

228
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:14,940
feed-forward neural network and so what

229
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:16,890
you do you connect them all together but

230
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:20,160
remember you initialize all those edges

231
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:23,940
with random numbers right well then for

232
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:25,530
this car neural network need a training

233
00:11:25,530 --> 00:11:28,410
set let's say we've got a whole bunch of

234
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:31,170
images that we've already gathered we've

235
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:32,430
already figured out where all the facial

236
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:35,460
features are in this image okay this

237
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:36,900
data sets out that they're available

238
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:39,600
with all this stuff right we already

239
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,950
figured out what the facial features are

240
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:42,390
of this image I mean actually we also

241
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:46,830
know the emotion in it as well we pump

242
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:48,690
those features in maybe the features are

243
00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:51,540
kind of the XY coordinates of each pupil

244
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:54,660
and other things we pump those in we

245
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:56,550
multiply all across then gives us a

246
00:11:56,550 --> 00:12:00,600
number at the end right we we though

247
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,430
what does 3 mean that we've decided

248
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:07,440
actually that in this neural network 0

249
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:11,390
maybes unhappy in 10 is happy right

250
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:13,740
someone has a human being has looked at

251
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:16,410
that image and they said that's 8 so we

252
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:19,110
know it's wrong of course it's wrong you

253
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:22,370
initialize a bunch of random numbers and

254
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:24,390
multiply them together it's not gonna

255
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:26,310
it's not finished right it's a start in

256
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:29,850
office course it's wrong right but what

257
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:32,070
we need to do is enter just those

258
00:12:32,070 --> 00:12:34,290
numbers based off of how wrong it is so

259
00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:36,630
we know because we know this data that

260
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:39,870
it's off by 5 this is the magic use an

261
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:41,640
algorithm use a technique called back

262
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:45,600
propagation ok given how wrong the

263
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:49,260
network is how do you tweak those

264
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:52,110
numbers so next time you run it it's

265
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:52,880
more right

266
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,860
ok that's back propagation and that's

267
00:12:55,860 --> 00:13:01,330
what you do

268
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:03,860
and so then it tweaks it perhaps you

269
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:05,330
keep on running it with your date and

270
00:13:05,330 --> 00:13:06,680
you keep on running with it until it

271
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:09,110
gets less wrong less wrong less wrong

272
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:11,960
less wrong and so eventually what

273
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:15,050
happens is you give an eighth image and

274
00:13:15,050 --> 00:13:17,740
if we correctly predicts that it's eight

275
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:18,920
okay

276
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:21,320
that process is training a neural

277
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:24,080
network all it's doing is tweaking those

278
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:26,420
weights so the next time you go through

279
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:28,360
it becomes better and better and better

280
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:31,760
okay that's how you could do it there

281
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,650
are actually well-known datasets out

282
00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:34,970
there that you can get the freely

283
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:38,000
available which have a whole bunch of

284
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,640
images 10,000 20,000 30,000 a hundred I

285
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:43,040
mean which loads of images each image

286
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,350
has been a human being is gone through

287
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:48,020
and determine what emotion is and you

288
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:50,810
can build and train your network in

289
00:13:50,810 --> 00:13:56,029
order to detect emotion okay so you

290
00:13:56,029 --> 00:13:59,540
could do okay but a lot what's been

291
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:01,610
happening over the last two years one of

292
00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:02,750
those lots of things happening in space

293
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:03,950
over the last years once we've really

294
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:05,630
been happening in the last two years is

295
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:07,640
a commoditization

296
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,950
of these services especially it's very

297
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:15,200
very commonly used models a lot of

298
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,000
different companies Microsoft included

299
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,270
have been making them available via

300
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:22,220
api's and that's what I use that's what

301
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:23,540
I use for this service I use something

302
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:25,820
called the face api which can get from

303
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:28,940
Azure and it's very very very easy to

304
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:34,339
use you basically just post an image to

305
00:14:34,339 --> 00:14:36,890
that URL and it gives you some data back

306
00:14:36,890 --> 00:14:38,440
at the backend it's using something

307
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:41,870
exactly like I've showed you it's been

308
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:45,010
trained in a much much bigger data set

309
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:48,290
over much much much longer at a time but

310
00:14:48,290 --> 00:14:49,280
it gives you a whole bunch of

311
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:51,560
information for each image in the face

312
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:55,060
image in the for each face in the image

313
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:58,790
bla it gives you a face rectangle the

314
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:00,440
face attributes with emotion gets a

315
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:02,420
whole lot more as well just strips all

316
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:02,810
out

317
00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:04,970
anger contempt disgust fear happiness

318
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:07,490
teacher sadness and surprise between

319
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:11,330
zero and one do you see the odd beard we

320
00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:14,220
have we got bed

321
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:17,530
yes yeah you cannot be hunter person

322
00:15:17,530 --> 00:15:19,930
happy really sorry about that it's

323
00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:20,950
actually impossible

324
00:15:20,950 --> 00:15:24,450
I've tried I can only be 99% happy

325
00:15:24,450 --> 00:15:27,160
that's basically I used in the moji fire

326
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,060
right

327
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:29,740
that's how I built it that's how I

328
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:34,090
detected in motion inside there just to

329
00:15:34,090 --> 00:15:37,150
summarize your networks just incredibly

330
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:39,580
powerful that incredibly powerful but

331
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:42,100
actually conceptually they're really

332
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:44,350
simple to understand I explained you a

333
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:47,140
really basic one in about five five ten

334
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:49,450
minutes something like that right okay

335
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:52,390
basic the other kind of lesson learned

336
00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:54,460
here might be when I do teach my

337
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:55,810
workshops to get people ask me questions

338
00:15:55,810 --> 00:15:56,650
afterwards

339
00:15:56,650 --> 00:15:58,660
so this taught them how to do training

340
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:00,820
for neural network from scratch then

341
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:03,100
they asked me I want to build this and

342
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:06,090
I'm like oh there's 18 API is available

343
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:08,830
will you do that right so first off also

344
00:16:08,830 --> 00:16:10,540
especially these days check to see

345
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:12,640
there's an API that already gives you

346
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:16,750
the answer that you're looking for next

347
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:22,450
demo okay and I'm fine so I run

348
00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:23,740
workshops on machine learning with

349
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:25,330
JavaScript in one of the workshops in

350
00:16:25,330 --> 00:16:28,180
London a guy called Oliver Turner then

351
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:31,090
built this demo and their center back

352
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:34,180
seam proud moment when your workshop on

353
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:36,550
your students build something sends it

354
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:40,300
back and this is what it does basically

355
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:45,730
if you do yeah it's doing a search for

356
00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:48,340
unsplash for puppies getting that image

357
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:50,320
back there then the percentage in the

358
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,690
bottom left are it trying to figure out

359
00:16:52,690 --> 00:16:54,850
what's inside the image you can see here

360
00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:57,130
it's detectable here's like it fountain

361
00:16:57,130 --> 00:16:58,150
mmm

362
00:16:58,150 --> 00:17:05,079
puppies ten percent a terrier bad you

363
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:06,880
search unsplash for I'm fine again

364
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:07,780
saying this image and it says

365
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:09,880
seventy-eight percent t-shirt not bad

366
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:12,640
okay not bad so the important lesson

367
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:16,180
here is that the only API request is

368
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:19,449
being made here is to get image the

369
00:17:19,449 --> 00:17:21,010
actual detection of what's inside the

370
00:17:21,010 --> 00:17:23,500
image is all done in javascript in the

371
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:26,060
browser okay we heard

372
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:28,220
I know I know we've heard of tensorflow

373
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:33,260
already in this in this were these

374
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:35,420
things called conferences in this

375
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:38,330
conference yeah I arrived last night

376
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:42,760
from London and think about well I think

377
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:47,390
yeah tensorflow is a tent tensorflow

378
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:49,610
since low is a technology which is open

379
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:52,190
just like Google for five years ago a

380
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:56,570
number and it allows you to run what a

381
00:17:56,570 --> 00:17:58,340
tensor is there's actually a

382
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:00,260
multi-dimensional array that's all

383
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:02,390
attempts that means a high dimensional

384
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:04,610
array so you can do kind of matrix

385
00:18:04,610 --> 00:18:07,340
calculations across whole bunch of

386
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:10,820
servers GPUs scale it out massively

387
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:13,310
right Brits built-in see it's really

388
00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:16,820
hardcore yeah but that's basically where

389
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:20,560
it's all about but start of last year

390
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:24,200
the creative tempo a yes we all like

391
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,010
that here don't we

392
00:18:25,010 --> 00:18:27,830
a little dot J s whenever they add that

393
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:30,140
to things we get really excited it's

394
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:36,460
like butter you know plain jacket potato

395
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:37,670
butter

396
00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:40,910
it's nice right that's what Jay s was

397
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:43,190
launched now it just a month or two ago

398
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:45,170
icon with the last tense for some it may

399
00:18:45,170 --> 00:18:47,270
reach 1.0 so house actually reached a

400
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:50,090
stay at maturity now today I know we

401
00:18:50,090 --> 00:18:51,680
hope we've gone through this before but

402
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:53,450
this is all you need to do in order to

403
00:18:53,450 --> 00:18:58,190
use 10 so jess is well if you mean you

404
00:18:58,190 --> 00:19:06,770
use this one but that's but the

405
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:08,210
important thing here is that's all you

406
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:10,400
need in order to start playing around

407
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,930
with machine learning jobs this is it

408
00:19:11,930 --> 00:19:14,060
when I first thought Enzo J's I thought

409
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:17,000
it was like node bindings and you had to

410
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,820
install tensorflow not to use it no it's

411
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:22,010
actually really tense we rerun from the

412
00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:24,980
ground up in JavaScript there's like a

413
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:26,930
subset of what's available in the proper

414
00:19:26,930 --> 00:19:28,430
turn slope it has enough to do some pre

415
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:32,520
some pretty cool stuff

416
00:19:32,530 --> 00:19:34,310
and you can do a whole bunch of things

417
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:35,840
that you can do what I just described to

418
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,280
you earlier on which is a trainer model

419
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,559
the whole thing with the newer

420
00:19:39,559 --> 00:19:41,269
and then the weight and then the

421
00:19:41,269 --> 00:19:43,909
backpropagation all that tuning stuff

422
00:19:43,909 --> 00:19:45,830
you can do that intense flow Jess you

423
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:50,179
can write oh you can load pre train

424
00:19:50,179 --> 00:19:53,779
models doing pre train models if you go

425
00:19:53,779 --> 00:19:55,549
to ten so jess website you actually find

426
00:19:55,549 --> 00:19:57,289
now there's like the big it's growing

427
00:19:57,289 --> 00:19:59,840
there's a hot there's a set of pre train

428
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,700
models very easy preacher and models you

429
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,049
can just grab from their website and

430
00:20:03,049 --> 00:20:05,360
start using you can also there's also

431
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:06,919
now scripts available where you can take

432
00:20:06,919 --> 00:20:08,570
a model chained up using tensorflow

433
00:20:08,570 --> 00:20:12,980
proper and then convert those models for

434
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:15,559
use in pencil for chair so you can start

435
00:20:15,559 --> 00:20:17,539
using them but essentially as long as

436
00:20:17,539 --> 00:20:19,039
good as adjacent file available you can

437
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:22,700
load it up from within the browser and

438
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:24,860
that's kind of what all of the use so

439
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:27,980
use something called mobile net which is

440
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:31,840
just a very optimized neural network

441
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:35,240
that can detect one of a thousand things

442
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:37,399
only a thousand things that's why it

443
00:20:37,399 --> 00:20:39,440
wasn't very good there's only a thousand

444
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,929
things that can detect in the world but

445
00:20:41,929 --> 00:20:44,509
it's mobile so it's been optimized for

446
00:20:44,509 --> 00:20:47,960
size so it can be small to use on a

447
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:50,720
mobile but that's it only like four

448
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:54,529
lines of code I say it's crazy four

449
00:20:54,529 --> 00:20:56,470
lines of code in JavaScript to do that

450
00:20:56,470 --> 00:20:59,360
right I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna get

451
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,159
this wrong statistically but I think it

452
00:21:01,159 --> 00:21:06,789
was 2008 was it we still couldn't detect

453
00:21:06,789 --> 00:21:09,159
whether an image was a cat or a dog

454
00:21:09,159 --> 00:21:12,529
right using whatever servers that we

455
00:21:12,529 --> 00:21:14,330
could now in JavaScript we can do this a

456
00:21:14,330 --> 00:21:19,759
bit crazy but it's mobile net right so

457
00:21:19,759 --> 00:21:21,499
it's it's not very good you saw it

458
00:21:21,499 --> 00:21:23,330
wasn't very very good it wasn't that

459
00:21:23,330 --> 00:21:24,980
good right it's useful for a lot of

460
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:25,970
other things it's useful something

461
00:21:25,970 --> 00:21:28,450
called transfer learning it's useful for

462
00:21:28,450 --> 00:21:32,629
some use cases but not to really know

463
00:21:32,629 --> 00:21:34,009
what's in an image like if your life

464
00:21:34,009 --> 00:21:36,289
depended on it you wouldn't use mobile

465
00:21:36,289 --> 00:21:37,249
net right

466
00:21:37,249 --> 00:21:38,869
you want to use somebody's been trained

467
00:21:38,869 --> 00:21:41,960
up on a much larger data set with much

468
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:44,360
more features and these things are kind

469
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:47,240
of gigabytes terabytes big and not not

470
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,399
big enough to download on your computer

471
00:21:48,399 --> 00:21:53,850
but they're available via

472
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:56,570
I'm gonna pretend to me said api's you

473
00:21:56,570 --> 00:21:59,289
said api's right yeah API is correct I

474
00:21:59,289 --> 00:22:01,070
mean we've got another one called

475
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:05,030
computer vision I knew you can you can

476
00:22:05,030 --> 00:22:07,730
detect like an insane amount of

477
00:22:07,730 --> 00:22:10,159
information if you give an image one of

478
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:12,140
the really scary things it does it

479
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:14,120
shocks me it still scares me actually is

480
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:17,090
it you can give an image and they can

481
00:22:17,090 --> 00:22:21,289
give you a human readable description of

482
00:22:21,289 --> 00:22:24,409
what's in the image as if a human being

483
00:22:24,409 --> 00:22:28,130
wrote it right my friend Sara Rosen have

484
00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:31,100
made a cool demo with this she thought

485
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:32,390
wouldn't it be cool if you could use

486
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:35,390
that to describe the alt text the alt

487
00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:37,250
tag in images because we all do that

488
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:39,679
right we're all supposed to add alt tags

489
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:42,080
for images right we're all doing it so

490
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,780
this is completely unnecessary I know

491
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:45,980
but if you did want to use it you could

492
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:50,840
try out it's a code pen so you can you

493
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:52,700
can put in an image and the text at the

494
00:22:52,700 --> 00:23:01,600
top let me know this is TV show no wow

495
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:04,090
you're in for a treat

496
00:23:04,090 --> 00:23:08,150
just halt and catch fire yeah it's an

497
00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:10,400
amazing TV show it talks to talks about

498
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:13,370
start something kind of 1985 and talks

499
00:23:13,370 --> 00:23:15,409
about computing back in those days and

500
00:23:15,409 --> 00:23:17,659
she's one of the stars in the show is

501
00:23:17,659 --> 00:23:20,570
Mackenzie Davies this is a when you give

502
00:23:20,570 --> 00:23:21,559
her this image this is the this is the

503
00:23:21,559 --> 00:23:23,330
the caption it gives it was a Mackenzie

504
00:23:23,330 --> 00:23:25,940
Davies and all standing in front of a

505
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:32,240
building right pretty pretty good for

506
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,880
service but you know she released on

507
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,220
Twitter and the twitter is full of

508
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:40,370
really helpful people you know all were

509
00:23:40,370 --> 00:23:43,909
very supportive we kindly tell you when

510
00:23:43,909 --> 00:23:46,820
something some work right and I saw some

511
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:49,159
people said so they said oh this doesn't

512
00:23:49,159 --> 00:23:54,220
work so a star-filled sky takes days for

513
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:58,309
actually don't know maybe the Asian I

514
00:23:58,309 --> 00:23:59,539
don't know what they were characters but

515
00:23:59,539 --> 00:24:02,510
what it is it's not accurate that's true

516
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:06,440
no the next one I think is uh

517
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:15,259
be true could be true no I mean you

518
00:24:15,259 --> 00:24:20,080
don't know dude let's go be dead cats

519
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:24,919
stuffed on a bed really good ones

520
00:24:24,919 --> 00:24:28,190
I really like the next one because cuz

521
00:24:28,190 --> 00:24:29,240
we're half right

522
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:35,710
we're half right on the next one yeah

523
00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:39,440
that's good that's 50% that's past mark

524
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:48,649
where I come from so just to summarize

525
00:24:48,649 --> 00:24:50,480
and that's probably one takeaway to take

526
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,129
from this just tensorflow Jess doesn't

527
00:24:52,129 --> 00:24:54,200
have any dependencies they're gonna play

528
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,730
around machine learning each one's do

529
00:24:55,730 --> 00:24:57,200
quickly you're suffocating the browser

530
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,330
confusing node well actually I take that

531
00:24:59,330 --> 00:24:59,659
back

532
00:24:59,659 --> 00:25:01,700
tend to flow chess in though does have

533
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:04,039
dependencies but then slow Jess in the

534
00:25:04,039 --> 00:25:05,330
browser you can just stop playing around

535
00:25:05,330 --> 00:25:07,610
with it with nothing mobile there's a

536
00:25:07,610 --> 00:25:09,950
really simple way to analyze images and

537
00:25:09,950 --> 00:25:10,940
it's usually something if you come to

538
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:12,379
the workshop later on is how we start

539
00:25:12,379 --> 00:25:13,759
off always gonna start off with mobile

540
00:25:13,759 --> 00:25:17,299
net but if you really wanna do some kind

541
00:25:17,299 --> 00:25:19,519
of really deep image analysis you want

542
00:25:19,519 --> 00:25:21,830
to use an API or you want to spend a

543
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:24,379
couple hundred thousand dollars training

544
00:25:24,379 --> 00:25:29,899
one up or something like that right time

545
00:25:29,899 --> 00:25:33,789
for the last one okay

546
00:25:33,789 --> 00:25:36,980
it's called image to image you find this

547
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:40,610
on the air Jess rocks website let's just

548
00:25:40,610 --> 00:25:50,740
take a look at actually

549
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:55,500
this is running in the browser okay

550
00:25:55,500 --> 00:26:00,060
you would outline of a cat and it draws

551
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:05,250
the rest of the cats go by a guy called

552
00:26:05,250 --> 00:26:08,310
the Zaid he's still at university I

553
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:15,240
wasn't doing stuff University yeah

554
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:18,150
amazing work right how does it work

555
00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:22,250
he's an algorithm called pics to pics

556
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:24,330
there was an example of something call

557
00:26:24,330 --> 00:26:26,250
again

558
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:31,020
a generative adversarial neural network

559
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:32,910
and what they how they work is it's to

560
00:26:32,910 --> 00:26:36,720
neural networks that are competing with

561
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:40,620
each other okay so first off you have a

562
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:44,730
generator okay and you have another one

563
00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:47,160
called a discriminator the generators

564
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:52,350
job is given some inputs whatever input

565
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:54,150
that is in this case it's and outlines

566
00:26:54,150 --> 00:26:57,300
of images of outlines of cats given that

567
00:26:57,300 --> 00:27:01,320
input its job it's a generate an image

568
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:09,570
of a cat that's this job right and

569
00:27:09,570 --> 00:27:11,310
that's what you do you you get in a

570
00:27:11,310 --> 00:27:14,190
whole set of import outline images you

571
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:16,440
get a generator to generate outputs it's

572
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:17,670
not going to do a really good job right

573
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:21,420
now cuz it's all math dot random right

574
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:22,800
it's not it's all gonna be noise to

575
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,810
begin with but whatever you take all

576
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:27,210
those images and you combine them with

577
00:27:27,210 --> 00:27:30,180
pictures of real cats you jumble all

578
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:32,490
together and you pass it into the scrim

579
00:27:32,490 --> 00:27:36,210
into the discriminators job is to figure

580
00:27:36,210 --> 00:27:39,570
out if an image is of a real cat or of a

581
00:27:39,570 --> 00:27:43,740
generated cat remember the discriminator

582
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:46,380
has also been initialized with math dot

583
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:48,660
random so it's not going to do a very

584
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:52,140
good job as well is it right probably

585
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:54,570
you might get it wrong the first time

586
00:27:54,570 --> 00:27:57,810
around you might think the real cat is a

587
00:27:57,810 --> 00:27:59,070
fake cat

588
00:27:59,070 --> 00:28:00,360
but then what do you do when it went a

589
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:05,520
neural network is wrong we train I'll

590
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:08,490
take it train it we do that

591
00:28:08,490 --> 00:28:10,530
backpropagation thing we tweak it we

592
00:28:10,530 --> 00:28:13,820
tune it we tuned until it gets better

593
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:20,490
okay but if it got it right it detected

594
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:21,780
it right that means it generators not

595
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:25,140
doing a very good job the generator is

596
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:29,730
wrong we tuned the generator and that's

597
00:28:29,730 --> 00:28:31,290
what's going on as a generator gets

598
00:28:31,290 --> 00:28:33,660
better the discriminating s better as a

599
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:35,070
generator gets better discriminate and

600
00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:37,590
the fighting versus each other that's

601
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:41,430
what they're doing until eventually the

602
00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:43,110
generator is doing such a good job

603
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:45,540
generating cat images the discriminator

604
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:47,730
can't figure out what's real and what's

605
00:28:47,730 --> 00:28:51,690
what's fake anymore right and then you

606
00:28:51,690 --> 00:28:53,010
know you're done you know trainings

607
00:28:53,010 --> 00:28:55,620
finished and what we do is you throw

608
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:57,360
away the discriminator we don't need

609
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,950
that anymore we just need a generator

610
00:28:58,950 --> 00:29:01,500
and you can export that if you're

611
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:05,280
careful you can export it into a small

612
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:06,960
enough size you can load up in the

613
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:09,060
browser and that's what they did and

614
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:11,070
then you can give it your own outlines

615
00:29:11,070 --> 00:29:14,240
and they can generate images of cats

616
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:18,960
okay that's a gang but you don't just

617
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:22,590
have to use it with cats works with

618
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:24,180
anything right if you train it with the

619
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:25,110
right data set

620
00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:34,220
oh this so your left is the input and

621
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:39,270
the right is the output okay but this

622
00:29:39,270 --> 00:29:50,090
isn't pix to pics this bit of it

623
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:57,020
this doesn't work in JavaScript yet but

624
00:29:57,020 --> 00:29:59,940
maybe not so far away um how about this

625
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:12,760
example one input multiple outputs

626
00:30:12,770 --> 00:30:15,240
remember it doesn't it doesn't just have

627
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:18,210
to take out lines as inputs you can give

628
00:30:18,210 --> 00:30:19,920
again whatever you want as an input

629
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:22,740
whatever you want right in this case you

630
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:24,780
can give it what's called a segmented

631
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:27,540
image which is just an outline d the

632
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:29,280
different colors kind of give you a clue

633
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:32,580
as a the 3d nature of the image and the

634
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:34,830
depth of the image and you can do

635
00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:38,580
something like this okay she's not

636
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:41,430
dancing I wish I could get a real-life

637
00:30:41,430 --> 00:30:50,190
one of one of these for me yeah how

638
00:30:50,190 --> 00:30:55,190
about this one there's a segmented

639
00:30:55,190 --> 00:30:58,440
Street image top-left these two are just

640
00:30:58,440 --> 00:30:59,850
different algorithms and that's the

641
00:30:59,850 --> 00:31:02,820
width of it one there again all right

642
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:12,450
it's generated completely generated

643
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:15,590
but you don't have to even give it even

644
00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:18,680
an image you don't even have to give an

645
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:24,730
image you can just give a text as input

646
00:31:24,730 --> 00:31:26,930
okay remember it's just whatever text

647
00:31:26,930 --> 00:31:28,010
you give it's going to generate

648
00:31:28,010 --> 00:31:30,080
something so you give it some text as

649
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:32,090
input and you also generated generate an

650
00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:35,060
image that's what you doing so these are

651
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:39,260
two examples here so in the top one the

652
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:41,180
input text is this flower has long thin

653
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:43,160
yellow petals and a lot of yellow

654
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:46,280
anthers in the center stage one is after

655
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:49,010
six hundred iterations Stage two is

656
00:31:49,010 --> 00:31:51,200
after twelve hundred iterations you can

657
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,000
see well this one's not very good but

658
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,580
the rest are pretty good right and this

659
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:58,280
is another one using birds so this bird

660
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:01,190
is white black and brown in color with a

661
00:32:01,190 --> 00:32:06,620
brown beak again stage one is uh 600 not

662
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:08,780
the best but stage two is very good I

663
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:10,970
think it's one here it's not very good

664
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:21,550
maybe so that's it just to summarize

665
00:32:21,550 --> 00:32:25,320
yeah

666
00:32:25,330 --> 00:32:30,710
ganz learn to generate new images okay

667
00:32:30,710 --> 00:32:32,960
they they generate they generate things

668
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,520
that's what's so exciting about them to

669
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:38,840
cover the creative side of machine

670
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:40,870
learning right they generate things

671
00:32:40,870 --> 00:32:43,550
discriminators that's why we use mostly

672
00:32:43,550 --> 00:32:44,990
used machine learning you just to tell

673
00:32:44,990 --> 00:32:47,540
us what something is or isn't right but

674
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:50,090
generators can generate create that's

675
00:32:50,090 --> 00:32:56,270
why so exciting about oh but they take a

676
00:32:56,270 --> 00:32:58,490
lot of computer train a lot more than a

677
00:32:58,490 --> 00:33:02,630
normal Network but the generator can be

678
00:33:02,630 --> 00:33:05,720
exported and run in the browser I think

679
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:09,110
I'm over time I think if you want to

680
00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:11,300
learn a little bit more about Ted's flow

681
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:14,300
Jess I am considering writing a book so

682
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:16,190
you take a screenshot of this if I get a

683
00:33:16,190 --> 00:33:19,010
hundred signups I think I'm about ninety

684
00:33:19,010 --> 00:33:20,760
right now such the tenth

685
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:23,130
I will start a Kickstarter or something

686
00:33:23,130 --> 00:33:27,870
to decieve see fun writing it if you

687
00:33:27,870 --> 00:33:29,070
want to learn a little bit more about

688
00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:30,330
machine learning especially want to use

689
00:33:30,330 --> 00:33:33,450
some api's I have a module if you go

690
00:33:33,450 --> 00:33:35,190
there it's a tutorial step by step will

691
00:33:35,190 --> 00:33:36,330
shows you how to build something that

692
00:33:36,330 --> 00:33:38,430
emoji fire I have a slack box you're

693
00:33:38,430 --> 00:33:40,680
gonna learn more kind of simple API

694
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:43,470
route and go that way and thank you for

695
00:33:43,470 --> 00:33:44,920
mystery time thank you
