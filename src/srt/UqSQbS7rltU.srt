1
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:31,389
Thanks.

2
00:00:31,389 --> 00:00:39,440
When we talk about burn out we talk about
three things and we don't always clarify what

3
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:42,530
we're talking about, we use it kind of interchangeably.

4
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:47,140
So the first is depression.

5
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:51,860
If you are depressed that's a medical problem
that requires medical help, I'm not a medical

6
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:55,810
professional and I'll give you no advice on
this topic.

7
00:00:55,810 --> 00:01:00,140
The second thing is straight up over work.

8
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:03,100
You can't work constantly.

9
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:08,470
Everything we know about 80 hour work weeks
says that why we're not working them when

10
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:12,079
we think they're and two they're not sustainable.

11
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:18,930
I really like this, you get sent to Bora Bora
if you work too much.

12
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:25,969
The third thing is what I want to talk about
today, we expect and ask more of are jobs

13
00:01:25,969 --> 00:01:32,450
than we get from them, so there is this gap
of what we need and what we have and if it

14
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:39,560
goes on for too long, or it gets too large,
that's when we start to feel burnt out.

15
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:44,180
You know, I often think that these things
can to go, write, like I know for myself,

16
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:49,390
being creative is so much a part of being
happy, burn out, depression, where does one

17
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:53,010
begin and the other one end, they're distinct
problems.

18
00:01:53,010 --> 00:02:03,780
A few years ago I moved to Australia to run
an iOS team, we went to, it was started before

19
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:10,090
I arrived within six months, I kept my hours
45 a week, I would still come home on Friday

20
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:13,950
night and feel like my brain had bled out
through my eyes.

21
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:20,370
Then it was done and you know, they would
like this guy is going to ship next month,

22
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:26,239
go and help him, he didn't ship next month,
or the month after.

23
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:29,790
In fact I think it was about eight months
later.

24
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:37,819
It was really hard from running my own little
team to working on a project that wasn't really

25
00:02:37,819 --> 00:02:39,870
running effectively.

26
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:46,620
In this position where like I had no influence
over making that better.

27
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:53,139
Add to this like the super miserable experience
of being harassed at work and the awful HR

28
00:02:53,139 --> 00:02:58,569
process that ensued, I was in a really bad
place emotionally and my job was just like

29
00:02:58,569 --> 00:03:01,150
not fulfilling.

30
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:07,239
So I tried to double down on my career, I'll
just work on Saturdays, I just need to work

31
00:03:07,239 --> 00:03:11,180
harder, I'm going to do a side project.

32
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:16,220
So I started doing a side project and then
there was a reorganisation and it was clear

33
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:21,829
that the side project was never going to launch
either, I realised that what I needed was

34
00:03:21,829 --> 00:03:25,629
to ship, that's what I missed.

35
00:03:25,629 --> 00:03:31,919
The answer was not internal side projects,
but my own personal side project.

36
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:37,019
As an extra thing I had to - I think this
was the worst manager I ever had, he explained

37
00:03:37,019 --> 00:03:41,890
to me that he believed by never giving me
positive feedback he was training me not to

38
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:46,589
need any \{Laughter\}.

39
00:03:46,589 --> 00:03:50,199
If anyone is contemplating this, it doesn't
work!

40
00:03:50,199 --> 00:03:58,139
\{Laughter\} So, as I shifted my focus to external
projects I got some much needed positive feedback

41
00:03:58,139 --> 00:03:59,389
as well.

42
00:03:59,389 --> 00:04:06,139
So, it turns out that this was not an entirely,
like, random realisation and I didn't invent

43
00:04:06,139 --> 00:04:07,189
anything here.

44
00:04:07,189 --> 00:04:13,599
There are six main causes of professional
burn out, the Maslach burn out, there is an

45
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:20,070
inventory and a book associated with it called
'The truth about burn out' the first one is

46
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:24,110
lack of control, that sounds familiar, hey!

47
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:33,470
Wait, then the next one, in sufficient reward,
also familiar.

48
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:37,370
Lack of community.

49
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:42,520
I went through this list and I'm like, Huh,
you know, this was the first project in a

50
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:46,270
while that I'd been on where I was the only
woman on the team and there were a number

51
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:50,300
of reasons why I felt very lonely but that
was one of them.

52
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:53,330
The fourth, absence of fairness.

53
00:04:53,330 --> 00:05:00,830
Yeah, you know I've been successful and like
the result was that I ended up in a place

54
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:04,020
where I felt like I couldn't succeed.

55
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:07,580
The fifth is conflict in values.

56
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:11,990
You know, I value execution on a product.

57
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:17,660
The team, they like decided that what they
should be doing is replying a platform to

58
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:22,560
build their project on, obviously I disagree
with that, but this not a talk about poor

59
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,900
engineering decisions, that would need way
more than 25 minutes!

60
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:30,479
The 6th is work overload.

61
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:36,520
I look at this list and like these are all
problems we could use side projects to help

62
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:44,599
with except for number 6, yeah, it would probably
hurt with number 6, I do see that.

63
00:05:44,599 --> 00:05:50,270
It's really hard to think of a side project
when you are feeling, you know, a bit dead

64
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:52,819
inside.

65
00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:57,770
It's really hard to think that you have anything
to offer anybody else's side project when

66
00:05:57,770 --> 00:06:03,430
the people that you work with day-to-day don't
seem to appreciate what you do.

67
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:11,120
My solution was to go back to my most recently
abandoned side project, we all have one, right.

68
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:16,180
So, I had this idea that, like, you know when
you look on your photographs on flickr or

69
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:21,610
whatever I thought it would be cool to visualise
a photograph stream just pulling out the dominant

70
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:29,849
colours from them, so the cool whites of Iceland,
lush green of Bali, the like orange and red

71
00:06:29,849 --> 00:06:37,150
of Canadian Fall, it would tell it's only
story in a abstract way.

72
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:41,930
So I got so far as this layout, this is the
most efficient way to layout circles, it's

73
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:48,819
called a sunflower layout, so I just was tainting
the RGB value and in the one on the right

74
00:06:48,819 --> 00:06:54,479
I just made it very close together, I kind
of like this, I imagine if I was to time travel

75
00:06:54,479 --> 00:07:00,759
it would jump through something like that.

76
00:07:00,759 --> 00:07:06,360
The next step was to pull the dominant colour
out of a photograph, like if someone solved

77
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:09,610
this the internet will help me.

78
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:11,360
The internet failed me.

79
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:21,060
But it did provide some interesting information,
image is array of pixels, a pixel is a square

80
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:34,949
of colour, there is a colour space all the
HSV space, the HSV is actually a lot closer

81
00:07:34,949 --> 00:07:41,219
to the way we think about colour, so the different
colours go round in the circle and those are

82
00:07:41,219 --> 00:07:48,210
the hue, the saturation, that we might think
about as intensity is the diameter and then

83
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:50,400
the high is brightness.

84
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,529
So at the bottom everything is black.

85
00:07:52,529 --> 00:07:59,880
So, I was like, ok, you know, count the pixels,
check the colour.

86
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:03,590
Put them in buckets and, you know, we'll have
that dominant colour.

87
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:05,669
It will be fine.

88
00:08:05,669 --> 00:08:10,610
This totally worked, but it turns out that
the dominant colour is often a little bit

89
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:19,259
sludgy, so the dominant colour on the left
that's the dominant colour extracted from

90
00:08:19,259 --> 00:08:20,259
the image.

91
00:08:20,259 --> 00:08:25,610
So I'm making these test images to see what
happens, I would only show things in a certain

92
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:30,069
range of the dominant colour, I started making
the cool partially coloured images and I could

93
00:08:30,069 --> 00:08:36,279
see better what was going on.

94
00:08:36,279 --> 00:08:41,590
So I made my visualisation, here it is.

95
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:48,250
It wasn't quite as incredible as I had imagined,
you know, it also took a really long time

96
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:51,490
to like, at least 30 minutes to calculate
these right.

97
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:58,410
One of the things that I discovered is that
for different images like, you need different

98
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:03,649
settings to really kind of capture what I
would perceive as the dominant colour, which

99
00:09:03,649 --> 00:09:10,990
kind of makes sense, right, the way we perceive
things, we abstract things, summarise things,

100
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:18,130
dominant colour is largely a matter of perception,
but I considered this to be the completion

101
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:20,470
of a successful side project, you know.

102
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:22,380
I moved on to other things.

103
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:27,930
Then I got asked to write a book chapter,
I was like, oh well, I guess I wrote this

104
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:31,870
algorithm, so I could write a book chapter.

105
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:37,089
So I made it into a little photograph, Ited
all of this in processing, by the way, whilst

106
00:09:37,089 --> 00:09:41,550
doing that I tried to put it online.

107
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:48,579
I used processing Java, not processing JavaScript,
I'm sorry, I know it's a JavaScript conference.

108
00:09:48,579 --> 00:09:53,220
As I started trying to put this online, I
started trying to run into things, I didn't

109
00:09:53,220 --> 00:10:01,279
want to deal - cross site describing permissions
and stuff, at some point on this journey,

110
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:07,500
I remembered I'm an expert mobile developer,
I was like Cate Huston why are you building

111
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:15,980
a mediocre desktop only app, clearly it should
be a web app, I started working, it got a

112
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:23,860
working prototype, I ran into terrible performance
problems, then I ended up creating a library

113
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:33,040
for testing, for generating and comparing
images on iOS, I ended up - you heard that

114
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:39,110
correctly, I optimised it for space and Time
Out side of the context of a technical interview,

115
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:40,810
it does occasionally happen.

116
00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:50,240
The app is called show and hide, it will be
out pretty soon, I located to the UK, quit

117
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:56,740
the job I hated and started working for myself,
this kind of remains my side project, the

118
00:10:56,740 --> 00:11:00,860
definition of side project is the things you
do for love not money.

119
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:05,029
Let's go back to that list.

120
00:11:05,029 --> 00:11:08,560
Because now I had control.

121
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:13,509
Sometimes too much control, but like I definitely
have control.

122
00:11:13,509 --> 00:11:16,540
Reward, people started to appreciate my work.

123
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:21,860
It was tied to other things I did at the same
time but till you know, I got much more positive

124
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:26,210
feedback from the community than I ever did
from that terrible manager.

125
00:11:26,210 --> 00:11:32,661
Community, I had editors and support on the
book chapter, I work with a designer and a

126
00:11:32,661 --> 00:11:35,279
branding person.

127
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:42,240
Fairness, proceeds from the book go to charity,
indie apps don't really make money I am excited

128
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:51,410
to get same share of nothing as everyone else
\{laughter\} values so the kind of project I

129
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:52,410
burnt out on

130
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:59,390
it was like an enormous yak shaving project,
I did shave a lot of yaks in this process,

131
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:04,459
but everyone of them filled a need, I was
able to share that outcome with other people.

132
00:12:04,459 --> 00:12:09,610
So from this testing library I made, building
a toolkit at workshop out of techniques I

133
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:16,540
used for doing really good test coverage on
iOS, getting the processing time down from

134
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:23,779
round like 10 seconds to instant, you know,
I solve actual problems not like made up engineer

135
00:12:23,779 --> 00:12:24,949
problems.

136
00:12:24,949 --> 00:12:33,199
There's an elephant in the room here and it's
name is time.

137
00:12:33,199 --> 00:12:34,199
Right?

138
00:12:34,199 --> 00:12:41,019
We only have 24 hours in the day 168 hours
in the week, some of us have a bunch of responsibilities

139
00:12:41,019 --> 00:12:50,220
that others don't I am not going to tell you,
you could make time if you try harder.

140
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:55,630
There's things like rescue time that can be
honest with useful about how you are spending

141
00:12:55,630 --> 00:13:01,079
you time, I am not going to tell you to stop
watching TV either, I am always baffled by

142
00:13:01,079 --> 00:13:07,550
the talks that say work all day, top watching
TV, come home work all evening everything

143
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:09,980
will be fine.

144
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:15,290
\{laughter\} you know I have never been watching
TV all evening, doesn't mean I don't have

145
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:18,050
unlimited hours to work right.

146
00:13:18,050 --> 00:13:19,959
I also just don't think that's sustainable.

147
00:13:19,959 --> 00:13:23,130
I am going to make two suggestions.

148
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:28,880
So firstly, are you doing stuff that you could
just not do?

149
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:36,779
For me, as a woman working in tech I ended
up doing a bunch of stuff that thank less

150
00:13:36,779 --> 00:13:38,580
emotional labour basically.

151
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:44,540
A lot of it was round trying to improve the
representation of women.

152
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:50,750
Ladies, we don't have to do this.

153
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:57,779
\{applause\} giving this up freed up a lot of
time.

154
00:13:57,779 --> 00:14:03,220
I cannot even tell you because I think that
stuff that you do is not generally valued

155
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:09,940
is a great place to start looking for things
you can not do and free up time.

156
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:16,350
I get that you wouldn't do it if you didn't
think it was important, like that was me too,

157
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:22,860
but you can make a choice to prioritise what
makes you happier over what you think you

158
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:27,670
should be doing, but nobody else is going
to.

159
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:33,360
We know that women leave tech at a much greater
rate than men.

160
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:40,880
The best thing that any of us can do is be
happy and fulfilled in our careers.

161
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:47,810
Secondly different kinds of time allow for
different kinds of progress, and so if you

162
00:14:47,810 --> 00:14:52,220
use the time when you feel on top of your
game really well, then you can set yourself

163
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:55,980
up to achieve things when you are feeling
kind of meh.

164
00:14:55,980 --> 00:15:01,490
If you have test that you need to write if
you spec them out when you are really on top

165
00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:07,180
of things you can write them later when you
are feeling a bit like, life is hard.

166
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:11,500
Maybe even when you are watching TV offer
boiler plate your code whenever you are half

167
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:18,009
asleep on a Saturday morning, kind of fix
it, hook it up later in the day.

168
00:15:18,009 --> 00:15:24,190
I often start with something I consider to
be a warm up task if I am not really feeling

169
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:30,000
like super productive and sometimes that then
when I get done, sometimes it turns into a

170
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,839
little spiral and I build on it.

171
00:15:34,839 --> 00:15:39,490
The thought I want you to take away today
is a question.

172
00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:45,300
What if you expected more from your side projects
and less from your job?

173
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:54,680
If our side projects, ooh, what does your
human need?

174
00:15:54,680 --> 00:16:00,300
If our side projects involve other people,
how can we give them what they need?

175
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:04,149
It's worth asking someone, what do you want
to get out of this project because they might

176
00:16:04,149 --> 00:16:09,200
tell you, but we have this handy list we can
refer back and to see if we're maybe meeting

177
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:12,060
people's needs on that.

178
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:13,890
So control.

179
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:19,570
Control is super easy if you just own something,
but I think control is being able to influence

180
00:16:19,570 --> 00:16:21,100
the outcome.

181
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:22,259
You don't have to be in

182
00:16:22,259 --> 00:16:25,250
charge, you just need to feel like you can
make a difference.

183
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:29,870
If we want to give people control we have
to give up a little bit ourselves and we have

184
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:34,139
to trust them and this is really hard, right?

185
00:16:34,139 --> 00:16:38,339
We have to accept a little bit of chaos.

186
00:16:38,339 --> 00:16:44,740
Reward, there's this book called the 5 Love
Languages which seems like a bizarre thing

187
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:50,940
to mention in this context, it's the best
book I found that understands that different

188
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:55,459
people appreciate different kinds of appreciation.

189
00:16:55,459 --> 00:16:59,570
One of them is touch and just ignore that
one, touch is never an appropriate way to

190
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:03,040
reward someone in a professional context.

191
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:09,630
\{laughter\} The other ones are words, you can
tell people they did it great job.

192
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:16,200
Gifts, now these don't have to be big, you
know like oh I found this e-book that I thought

193
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,160
you might like.

194
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:21,190
Time, you know, mentoring people.

195
00:17:21,190 --> 00:17:26,850
Acts of service, and again this can be really
small like you are you are co-working you

196
00:17:26,850 --> 00:17:29,980
make a point to make them a cup of tea.

197
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:36,310
Reward is what makes people feel like their
contribution is appreciated.

198
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:38,810
Whatever that is.

199
00:17:38,810 --> 00:17:42,220
Community connection to other humans.

200
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:47,550
I think it's worth building healthy communities
on its own account, but let's just set that

201
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:54,050
aside for a moment because people will bond
together over a common enemy, this a short-term

202
00:17:54,050 --> 00:17:56,620
and not a long-term strategy.

203
00:17:56,620 --> 00:18:01,380
One thing we're seeing in open source right
now, is some projects are really investing

204
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:02,380
in their communities.

205
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:08,680
They are ramping up newbies, adding codes
of conduct, and we see others doubling down

206
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:11,760
on this fantasy of a meritocracy.

207
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:15,270
We will see in the long-term.

208
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:22,400
Fairness treating people equitably, can you
be transparent so it's clear what been rewarded

209
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,400
and why.

210
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:26,270
Can you work to remove bias.

211
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:30,540
Because we know in this industry that we have
a problem with the way that we treat women

212
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:34,760
and the way that we treat minorities.

213
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:40,690
We get this shit at work, I got called the
C word by a colleague amongst other things,

214
00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:45,850
and it was horrible, but I put up with this
stuff day today because they paid me really

215
00:18:45,850 --> 00:18:48,530
well to do that.

216
00:18:48,530 --> 00:18:49,530
Because I was on a work permit.

217
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:55,180
I don't want to put up with this stuff in
the things that I do in my free time, I don't

218
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:58,180
think I am alone there.

219
00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:03,810
This is part of being fair, and this is part
of being a good community.

220
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:06,110
Values.

221
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:12,970
If your project is values based you can community
them and bring values back to them I have

222
00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:16,080
some examples.

223
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:20,650
First call request project it's to help people
make their first contribution to open source

224
00:19:20,650 --> 00:19:26,910
software so control it makes contributing
to open source impossible.

225
00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:32,290
Reward, you get to be someone who has contributed
to open source.

226
00:19:32,290 --> 00:19:36,770
Community, it's designed to support you as
you do that.

227
00:19:36,770 --> 00:19:41,380
Fairness, it's about making open source more
accessible to people who historically have

228
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:47,400
been left out and values, this open source
software, this idea that we all use it, we

229
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,510
should all get back to it.

230
00:19:49,510 --> 00:20:00,990
Model view culture, it's a critique focused
on tech They solicit contributions for the

231
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:03,660
community and people write for it.

232
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:07,070
Control, you decide what you write about.

233
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:12,930
Rewards, they actually pay writers which is
it's very rare to get paid for you writing

234
00:20:12,930 --> 00:20:17,400
so I feel like for me it's always been that
I got paid to write rather than how much money

235
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,410
I made from it.

236
00:20:19,410 --> 00:20:20,560
Community.

237
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:24,210
This publication is a contribution to the
community that cares about inclusivity in

238
00:20:24,210 --> 00:20:25,680
tech and fairness.

239
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:34,810
This is the whole aim of social justice, right,
regardless of whatever game are spouting now.

240
00:20:34,810 --> 00:20:42,280
You see in every issue in every article.

241
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:47,380
Their final example is technically speaking
it's an newsletter that a friend and I

242
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:52,410
run we try to encourage people in there public
speaking.

243
00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:58,500
So our goal or pitch is like we're like the
mentor that shows up in your in box every

244
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:05,420
week saying you have something to say, and
here is some resources that might be helpful.

245
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:11,620
Control, it's all about making things seem
more possible, kind of demystifying things.

246
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:16,760
Reward, you know, maybe you get to come somewhere
like this right and share whatever it is that

247
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:20,770
you have been excited about on stage.

248
00:21:20,770 --> 00:21:22,810
You get to be a public speaker.

249
00:21:22,810 --> 00:21:29,630
Community, so we run webinars most months,
we engage with people on Twitter, we take

250
00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:32,510
questions find the resources that they need.

251
00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:33,960
Fairness.

252
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:38,620
So part of this is about demystifying this
process and this idea you don't need to be

253
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:42,230
chosen that you can put yourself forward.

254
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:46,450
We highlight things like travel costs because
we think that transparency there makes things

255
00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:47,980
fairer.

256
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:52,040
Values, this is the last one but it's a really
big one fours.

257
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:58,060
Like I said we think conferences should cover
travel costs, we weigh that in what CFPs we

258
00:21:58,060 --> 00:22:01,370
include, we also believe in inclusive events.

259
00:22:01,370 --> 00:22:03,580
We will only share things with a code of conduct.

260
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:09,990
I am not going to pretend that a code of conduct
is a high bar of inclusivity it's a new minimum

261
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:13,750
it's pretty telling when events don't have
one.

262
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:18,680
More broadly than that we curate this vision
of the tech industry that we wish we saw,

263
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:23,330
we share at least 50% content from women we
actively look for other under-represented

264
00:22:23,330 --> 00:22:27,300
groups to highlight and include.

265
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:32,160
So if you are feeling a little burnt out I
want to leave you with the question I asked

266
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,160
earlier.

267
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:39,800
What if you expected more from your side projects
and less from your job?

268
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:45,000
More broadly I want to ask what if we as a
community as asked more from our side projects

269
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,310
and less from our jobs.

270
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:53,380
I am really happy that I got to share this
talk at JSConfEU I know yarn and Tiffany and

271
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:58,890
the other organisers work super hard to make
it that kind of space so thank you so much

272
00:22:58,890 --> 00:22:59,890
for having me.
