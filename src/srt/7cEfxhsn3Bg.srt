2
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:15,660
good morning everyone and you know

3
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:18,420
thanks for joining us in for this talk

4
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:22,769
today I'm Dixon I am currently a final

5
00:00:22,769 --> 00:00:25,289
year student in NUS doing computer

6
00:00:25,289 --> 00:00:35,790
science and we have sorry and I'm so we

7
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:39,410
was sort of there's and we also have

8
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:42,930
along with me today is also contra he is

9
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:46,770
the founder of these abilities and we

10
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:48,530
are sort of working together on the

11
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:50,820
accessibility initiative here in

12
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:53,300
Southeast Asia and also today

13
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:55,379
unfortunately he couldn't join us is a

14
00:00:55,379 --> 00:00:58,879
young from grad so he's on grabs

15
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:02,039
first-line coder so let me just start

16
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:07,580
off by talking about what is a 1 1 y or

17
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:11,100
so even 1y you know stands for it's an

18
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:12,960
acronym for accessibility that is meant

19
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,900
to fit into four characters it's meant

20
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:17,939
to fit in more easily into a tweet and

21
00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:21,630
it's used pretty widely in the

22
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:25,500
accessibility community so I'm also

23
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,900
pretty active on Twitter as well so

24
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:30,210
accessibility is like simply put it's

25
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:33,000
the practice of making your product or

26
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,329
service as usable by as many people as

27
00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:38,909
possible so in the context of a website

28
00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:41,759
it could be ensuring that it works well

29
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:44,250
for let's see someone who is visually

30
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:46,290
impaired using a screen reader software

31
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:49,770
which other soon demonstrate or someone

32
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:52,470
using or ensuring that this responsively

33
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:55,320
designed for someone using screen

34
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,780
magnification or someone using a mobile

35
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:00,799
device so to give you a better sense of

36
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:04,500
what this is about of demonstrate how I

37
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:07,619
will use a screen reader to access a

38
00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:10,560
particular to look up information on

39
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,170
JavaScript or map function

40
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:17,880
so a screen reader is a software that

41
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:20,790
reads out the contents of the screen so

42
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:28,470
let me just demonstrate by Midway to be

43
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:30,959
written written regularly right

44
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:35,090
NVDA menu will not meet us and need

45
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:38,220
Google data Google Documents so this is

46
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:42,080
what right now what I want to do is to

47
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,030
use Google to search for information on

48
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:49,080
e on JavaScript map function and to add

49
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:51,209
the sort of bottom right is a printed

50
00:02:51,209 --> 00:02:53,190
transcript of what it's speaking so this

51
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:56,310
is roughly what it sounds like and it

52
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:58,650
provides keystrokes that I can

53
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:02,040
efficiently use to move to various

54
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,600
structural elements of the page so in

55
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,040
this case I want to move immediately to

56
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,480
the search box

57
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,519
noting landmark search combo bar to the

58
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:10,800
left and autocomplete editable and then

59
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,239
I can just start typing

60
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:19,310
yay-hey-hey beauty okay

61
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:22,640
James clerk Maxwell's Oh incidentally

62
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,049
[Music]

63
00:03:24,049 --> 00:03:27,269
it's started talking because the page

64
00:03:27,269 --> 00:03:29,340
has finished loading so what I typically

65
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:32,390
do for increase like productivity is to

66
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:37,170
listen to at a faster rate so this is

67
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:39,180
all possible because it uses a

68
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:41,850
synthesized voice so you can get used to

69
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:44,910
how it pronounces certain sentences or

70
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:49,110
phrases or words with me alright so here

71
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:52,530
I am at the top of the page and here I

72
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:55,500
know that Google users the level

73
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:59,310
headings to sort it users that head

74
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:01,650
level headings as titles of each search

75
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:03,989
results so I can immediately go to the

76
00:04:03,989 --> 00:04:10,960
first flat level hitting that I find

77
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:13,380
let's say I can also move to the next

78
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:15,670
one

79
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:20,010
right so I'm a fan of mdn so I'm just

80
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:24,210
going to go into this page

81
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:33,740
and let's see if his okay so it's it's

82
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:36,320
finished loading and I can say what I

83
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,030
typically do on an unfamiliar web page

84
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:41,060
is to try to move to the first heading

85
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:45,980
that I find so in this case I am here on

86
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:48,260
the mean height of the piece so I can go

87
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:57,400
down and start reading so this is the

88
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:00,290
syntax of the map function and I can

89
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:02,980
also have move slower using sort of

90
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:05,570
moving by word you know because

91
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:07,760
sometimes the parameters can be a bit

92
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:13,850
more complex so this is like roughly you

93
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:17,060
know how a screen reader works so I hope

94
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:19,610
that this gives you a better idea of how

95
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:22,760
the screen video user would perceive or

96
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:38,990
use your website right so why is you

97
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:43,460
know accessibility important so imagine

98
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:47,590
you're in your you know everyday life

99
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:51,710
not having convenient or easy access to

100
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:54,410
information that you need or not being

101
00:05:54,410 --> 00:05:57,260
able to you know perform some activities

102
00:05:57,260 --> 00:06:00,650
for your daily life so some examples for

103
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:04,190
myself could be you know not being able

104
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:07,370
to conveniently use an i banking website

105
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:09,500
because it doesn't work well or doesn't

106
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:13,010
use good HTML so I actually personally

107
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:15,830
experienced this problem on one of the

108
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:20,120
local banking websites you know some

109
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:23,380
other examples it would be not having

110
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:26,420
sort of convenient access to integrated

111
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:28,820
development environments which really I

112
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:31,130
would love to use them because it really

113
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:33,740
improves your your productivity but it

114
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:35,240
doesn't work well with a screen reader

115
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,070
typically

116
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:39,950
as well as you know not being able or as

117
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:41,510
well as perhaps you know booking and

118
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:44,560
uber or grab so some of these are

119
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,480
activities I find more challenging than

120
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:52,940
others but but I'm you know s soft we

121
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:54,350
have a great table like mainstream

122
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:57,919
awareness of how people will use your

123
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:00,590
various products and services I do see

124
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:03,710
this changing so one thing is that when

125
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:05,300
I'm using a new product or service

126
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,639
especially if you are using some

127
00:07:07,639 --> 00:07:09,530
alternative interface to accept to

128
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:11,630
access it whether it sort of works for

129
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:14,390
you is something that it's foremost in

130
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:17,810
your mind so I would like to pass on the

131
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:35,540
remaining time to demo so I just wanted

132
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:37,430
a quick poll at the same time

133
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:39,430
can you show can I have a show of hands

134
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:43,370
who saw a screen reader you know in the

135
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:46,729
flesh for the first time all right keep

136
00:07:46,729 --> 00:07:50,270
your hands there who knows for those who

137
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:52,850
know what a 1 1 y or web accessibility

138
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:54,410
is keep your hands raised the rest put

139
00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:57,590
it down all right sorry the lights -

140
00:07:57,590 --> 00:08:00,729
right okay and then keep your hands up

141
00:08:00,729 --> 00:08:03,440
only if you've worked on a web

142
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:06,640
accessibility project yourself before

143
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:09,560
all right so that's only a really really

144
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,970
small helpful I'm gonna speak to you

145
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:27,350
guys as well all right so I think you

146
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:29,660
know I just wanted to share a little bit

147
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:31,490
more the non-technical side for me it's

148
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:34,130
a little bit more than advocacy side to

149
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:36,560
really share why web accessibility is

150
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:38,300
really important and why we need it in

151
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:40,370
the region because it's almost

152
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:43,310
non-existent here so the first thing

153
00:08:43,310 --> 00:08:45,230
that I would like to talk about is you

154
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:47,089
know screen readers or web accessibility

155
00:08:47,089 --> 00:08:49,190
is really beneficial for some

156
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:51,050
like Dickson or gang who's not here

157
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:53,990
today so young is grabs first blind

158
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:56,600
quarter and Dixon is any rescue of

159
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,980
Computing's first visually impaired

160
00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:01,580
student you know we clearly can see why

161
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:03,170
it will benefit them in terms of work

162
00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:06,230
and studies but why we benefit us who

163
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:08,840
are not blind or visually impaired right

164
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:11,780
and the this is concept I would like to

165
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:13,160
introduce which is also called inclusive

166
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:15,620
design which is that when we design are

167
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:18,050
built for the extreme in you know in

168
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:20,240
essence we can design for more because

169
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,430
when we take reference from such

170
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:24,650
different lives that daily leads to

171
00:09:24,650 --> 00:09:26,330
fresh experiences that we can build for

172
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:30,740
our customers and even more so some of

173
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:32,660
the examples that I have here for

174
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:35,300
example I think voice UI is a really big

175
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:37,850
one now and you know the likes of Amazon

176
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:39,470
and hippo and the rest have actually

177
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:41,150
looked towards how blind people actually

178
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:44,440
live their lives and interact with with

179
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:47,420
audio cues in order to come up with

180
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:50,780
fresh experiences on that and GPS on the

181
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:53,210
other hand maybe not so much the

182
00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:55,820
satellite imagery but the user interface

183
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:58,070
and how we get navigated they were so so

184
00:09:58,070 --> 00:10:00,610
pioneered by someone who was blind and

185
00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:03,080
lastly of course you know OCR optical

186
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:06,140
character recognition that benefits

187
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:07,880
someone like Dixon when his professors

188
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:10,190
just send out PDFs of scanned pages of

189
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:12,560
text books that he can't read or see a

190
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,180
benefits him but at the same time we are

191
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:16,550
also using it for a lot of you know

192
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:21,620
security applications as well so just to

193
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:23,000
give you a little bit of a snapshot of

194
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,320
who does a 1:1 why or accessibility

195
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,860
these are some of the companies up there

196
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:33,550
Apple has been doing it for 27 years and

197
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:38,420
ok so if you if you look at the the

198
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:40,610
first three rows they're all no original

199
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:42,200
they are not companies they were started

200
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,000
in the region there's only one company

201
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,220
right at the bottom which is grab who

202
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:47,690
started in a region that actually

203
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:50,120
focuses on accessibility so how about

204
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,670
all the other startups the especially

205
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:54,350
the mature startups in the region are we

206
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:56,300
looking at accessibility if Dixon wants

207
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:57,830
to buy groceries from Vermont can he do

208
00:10:57,830 --> 00:11:00,290
that you know or always be so on and so

209
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:01,389
forth

210
00:11:01,389 --> 00:11:04,519
so that's what we wanted to encourage at

211
00:11:04,519 --> 00:11:09,199
the same time so apart from companies if

212
00:11:09,199 --> 00:11:11,810
we look across geography geographical

213
00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:16,540
boundaries in the EU earlier last year

214
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:19,699
it was made a legislative mandate that

215
00:11:19,699 --> 00:11:23,000
all governmental websites need to be web

216
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,970
accessible and because it was so

217
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:27,560
successful then they said you know why

218
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:29,060
not let's just extend it to mobile apps

219
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:31,430
as well for governmental services and so

220
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:34,600
that's the law of the land at the moment

221
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:38,269
so in sorry yeah

222
00:11:38,269 --> 00:11:41,180
and in in the US I think it's also a

223
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:43,790
little bit of a different take something

224
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:45,889
really interesting that that I would

225
00:11:45,889 --> 00:11:48,230
like to share is in the u.s. if you're a

226
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:50,540
person with a disability and you like a

227
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:52,370
particular service but it's not websites

228
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:54,139
about to you you can partner up with a

229
00:11:54,139 --> 00:11:56,329
lawyer to sue the company and the

230
00:11:56,329 --> 00:11:58,250
company cannot come to sue they can only

231
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:00,980
comply so this has been the story of how

232
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:03,139
companies like Airbnb and the rest have

233
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:04,850
you know started on the accessibility

234
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:07,939
journey about three months ago blind

235
00:12:07,939 --> 00:12:09,949
people's to mass comm because they say

236
00:12:09,949 --> 00:12:13,730
we want to find love as well so that's

237
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:15,800
that's the level in which you know

238
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,779
there's there's such support for web

239
00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:21,230
accessibility but how about in the

240
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:23,509
Southeast Asian region I think it is

241
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:27,559
severely lacking if you go into the web

242
00:12:27,559 --> 00:12:29,629
sites of any company that started in

243
00:12:29,629 --> 00:12:32,180
this region and you try to learn how to

244
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:33,439
use a screen reader like Dickson does

245
00:12:33,439 --> 00:12:35,029
you realize that for people with visual

246
00:12:35,029 --> 00:12:37,459
impairment you can't access the

247
00:12:37,459 --> 00:12:40,339
information and in an age where some

248
00:12:40,339 --> 00:12:42,709
people believe internet to be a basic

249
00:12:42,709 --> 00:12:45,610
human right that's just not fair to them

250
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:51,110
right so what we've decided to do is

251
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:54,529
essentially start a a one on why I

252
00:12:54,529 --> 00:12:58,040
initiated in Southeast Asia where we are

253
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:01,430
looking to get web developers across the

254
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:04,100
region starting in Singapore who would

255
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:07,430
express an interest to learn about web

256
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:09,980
accessibility how to do the audience how

257
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:12,199
to do the the fixtures for the

258
00:13:12,199 --> 00:13:13,050
accessibility

259
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:15,810
and to comply with the global standards

260
00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:20,490
for the web accessibility initiative so

261
00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:21,960
if this is something that you'll be

262
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:24,120
interested in essentially we would you

263
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,980
come in at zero experience we teach you

264
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:27,030
you can take it back to your companies

265
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:28,620
but at the same time we'll go a little

266
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:31,470
bit rope we will form little teams and

267
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:32,850
investigating all the different

268
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:34,170
companies and and help them with the

269
00:13:34,170 --> 00:13:35,970
accessibility as well so if there's

270
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:37,650
something they are interested in you can

271
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:41,040
come and speak to us and at the same

272
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:44,880
time with zero experience if you want to

273
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,410
learn how to do web accessibility we're

274
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:48,120
