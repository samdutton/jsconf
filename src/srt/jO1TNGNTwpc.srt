00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,960

one my name is Malta thanks for choosing

2
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:18,210
the front end talk I'm one of like 15

3
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:19,500
engineers at Google not working on

4
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:20,939
machine learning so differently

5
00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:22,650
appreciate the other people interested

6
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:25,439
in this yeah ok Google I specifically

7
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:27,450
work on a thing called amp project if

8
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:28,950
you've not heard about that it's kind of

9
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:31,079
a thing to make reliably fast web sites

10
00:00:31,079 --> 00:00:34,920
and like while doing this project and

11
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:37,260
learned a lot about something that's the

12
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:40,950
topic of this talk so and the talk is

13
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:44,280
going to be a little dark so I wanted to

14
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:47,880
start out on a lighter note which is

15
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:49,830
that JavaScript really is my favorite

16
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:51,780
programming language and for so many

17
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:56,610
reasons for example you can use it to

18
00:00:56,610 --> 00:00:58,770
build applications to make presentations

19
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:01,739
and just a few examples from from Jay's

20
00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:04,309
comms what we what we did over the years

21
00:01:04,309 --> 00:01:09,030
we made like robots and we made note

22
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:12,229
copters and we made freaking boats and

23
00:01:12,229 --> 00:01:17,130
remain note rockets of course and you

24
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:19,259
really can't like summarize it any other

25
00:01:19,259 --> 00:01:21,240
way than the javascript is freaking

26
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,340
awesome by the way when I came to this

27
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:24,950
conference I was talking to this person

28
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:28,770
telling like yeah I went to 15 j/s cops

29
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:31,319
already where she was saying like yeah

30
00:01:31,319 --> 00:01:34,979
you're really old so there's that by

31
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:37,889
that so JavaScript really awesome but it

32
00:01:37,889 --> 00:01:44,279
does have a really dark side and it's

33
00:01:44,279 --> 00:01:46,759
getting darker when you talk about

34
00:01:46,759 --> 00:01:50,639
third-party JavaScript or as I liked it

35
00:01:50,639 --> 00:01:54,509
to call it other people JavaScript so

36
00:01:54,509 --> 00:01:55,649
it's something we definitely didn't

37
00:01:55,649 --> 00:01:58,380
write ourselves and it's also not stuff

38
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:00,569
on NPM which is typically something you

39
00:02:00,569 --> 00:02:02,069
actually want because you like actively

40
00:02:02,069 --> 00:02:04,619
included third-party JavaScript works

41
00:02:04,619 --> 00:02:06,499
really differently and some examples are

42
00:02:06,499 --> 00:02:10,590
for example comments and polls stuff

43
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:13,170
like reviews ads of course I'm going to

44
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:15,330
talk about ads about social plugins I

45
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:17,700
could put a tweet on your side right you

46
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:19,050
just load some javascript file from

47
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:20,250
Twitter and you trust them to do

48
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:23,730
something that's nice in it and it might

49
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:26,610
not be right um I always give this

50
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:27,090
example

51
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:28,470
when you like if you were building a

52
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:30,780
native app and the first thing you do

53
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:33,030
you say like hey I'm going to make it in

54
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:34,830
secure HTTP request and load some more

55
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:36,750
native code from this other third party

56
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:40,050
that I barely know and in the cat's case

57
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:41,700
they like redirect somewhere else and

58
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:44,580
then you load their native code before

59
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:46,410
anything else happens and run it and

60
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:49,739
that like seems really not such a good

61
00:02:49,739 --> 00:02:51,420
idea but that's that's how this works

62
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:53,400
and I my talk is about like some

63
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,440
examples of what can happen and then

64
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:59,610
later on what we can do to handle it so

65
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:03,120
it's looking at my my site that had ads

66
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,040
the other day and I was searching in

67
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,610
chrome dev tools for the object tag you

68
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:12,120
know which is most I mean yesterday I

69
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,680
guess we learned that you can do useful

70
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,590
things with it mostly used alert to load

71
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:19,760
flash and so yeah so this page had 65

72
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:24,120
flash objects on them and so wondering

73
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,329
why and obviously it's because of ads

74
00:03:26,329 --> 00:03:31,709
which doesn't really explain it um so so

75
00:03:31,709 --> 00:03:37,049
but here is the the deep inside flash

76
00:03:37,049 --> 00:03:39,450
movies reduce the frame rate when

77
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:41,220
they're off screen right and that is a

78
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:43,230
very good idea right that's even though

79
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:45,750
Steve Jobs was totally against flash if

80
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:47,280
you reduce the frame rate and you can't

81
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,840
see it that's great right you don't use

82
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,609
as much battery you don't use as much

83
00:03:50,609 --> 00:03:55,349
CPU and so because of this you can use

84
00:03:55,349 --> 00:03:57,419
flash to mathur measure whether

85
00:03:57,419 --> 00:04:01,530
something's on the screen and that leads

86
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:04,349
us to space or dove Swift right so you

87
00:04:04,349 --> 00:04:06,769
can totally put a 1 x 1 pixel flash

88
00:04:06,769 --> 00:04:10,950
movie on on the screen and by observing

89
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:13,410
its frame rate you know whether that

90
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:17,250
pixel is visible and so you have things

91
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:26,130
ads and so yeah and so obviously it's

92
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:28,260
very important for the ad to actually

93
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:29,880
measure whether wishlists not rendered

94
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:32,039
somewhere deep down the screen where the

95
00:04:32,039 --> 00:04:34,710
user actually scroll there so you put a

96
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:38,820
flash movie on it and I mean that's

97
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,980
already like a big step forward but

98
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:42,780
only tells you something like about the

99
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:47,910
top 00 position so you you you add three

100
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:50,760
flesh movies and there's actually I

101
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,370
think a standard that says like

102
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:54,870
twenty-five percent of the ad has to be

103
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:56,970
visible for n seconds to be considered a

104
00:04:56,970 --> 00:04:59,310
view because you need to have these

105
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:02,720
twenty-five percent you add a few more

106
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,360
so it turns out there were seven flash

107
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:10,320
movies on this ad and now there's also

108
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,030
this issue that there's like the

109
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:14,160
advertiser the publisher the ad network

110
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,810
they don't trust each other so you you

111
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:17,880
can get to 21 flash movies on a single

112
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:21,530
ad totally not not not unheard of and

113
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:26,430
now you might like correctly question me

114
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:28,350
like yeah my phone doesn't actually a

115
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:31,860
flash them I'm good and of course it can

116
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:34,230
get even worse because the nice thing

117
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:36,330
about this flash solution is at least I

118
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:38,790
mean it's in a way incredibly

119
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:40,890
inefficient because certainly have

120
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:43,050
probably like a vm and each of these

121
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:45,660
flash things like so I mean you can't

122
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:48,990
even think about it but at least it will

123
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:50,790
like pushed you the information whether

124
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:52,800
it's visible on the screen right and um

125
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,220
so today on an iPhone this is basically

126
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:58,650
the best general solution you can you

127
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:02,580
can do all right well you just pull for

128
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:04,320
where it is right you can never know

129
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:07,050
that nothing else move to your round so

130
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:08,760
you can't like listen only for scroll

131
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:11,070
events because something like a thing

132
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:12,120
might be somewhere else right so you

133
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,500
have to like literally go and make like

134
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:16,800
get bounding client direct and call that

135
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,870
like however many times per second you

136
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:20,850
want and and that is really like the

137
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:22,860
worst possible thing you could do the

138
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:24,600
performance right you know you do this

139
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,920
all the time you don't in not even on

140
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:28,590
screen you're busy pulling like you're

141
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:30,090
probably calling something I'll get

142
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:31,260
Bonnie klein direct which is like

143
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:33,120
basically Tecna browse like you have to

144
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,560
really really really render everything

145
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,830
on this page you can't cheat like the

146
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:41,040
waveform collapses in this case like 25

147
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:44,670
times per second and so fortunately we

148
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:49,380
can do better nowadays it's it's in

149
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:51,030
chrome and I think it's coming in

150
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:53,910
Firefox and for Safari we can hope for

151
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:54,910
the 2007

152
00:06:54,910 --> 00:06:56,860
version so there's an API called

153
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:59,140
intersection observer where you can just

154
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:00,340
say like I would like to know what this

155
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:02,890
is and where this is in relation to the

156
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:06,880
screen and it sends you events as things

157
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,290
change and it doesn't send you events

158
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:09,940
when they don't change and it also

159
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:11,380
doesn't change send you them

160
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:13,420
synchronously it tells you after the

161
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:15,340
fact at this time it was there so you

162
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:17,500
don't have to like do this busy waiting

163
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,600
so that's that's good so at least there

164
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:24,010
is a way to do this right um doesn't

165
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:25,870
mean everyone's using it already but I

166
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:29,920
think it's a great great change and you

167
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,630
can use this for other many many other

168
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:35,470
useful things alright so that was Hawaii

169
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:38,260
we have so much flesh next thing I want

170
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:40,690
to talk about how browsers parse web

171
00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:46,360
pages it's it's really simple you take a

172
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,870
nation panel talk and look at its tokens

173
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:51,790
this is basically diagram there's a bit

174
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:55,200
more complexity there somewhere but

175
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:59,560
that's essentially how it works until

176
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:02,650
you see something like this probably all

177
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:08,380
heard about document right and the magic

178
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:09,820
of document ID right is completely

179
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:12,940
synchronous it changes how the current

180
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:15,940
document is being parsed so even if

181
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:18,340
there's like an openstack you can like

182
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:19,750
write into that because it's really

183
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:23,110
really weird and it gets worse because

184
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:24,430
you can actually write scripts

185
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:28,060
synchronous codes and those can do more

186
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:31,510
document or rights and that wonderful

187
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:34,240
simple state machine becomes something

188
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,820
like this so we like after parson we saw

189
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:38,979
we have a script tag we have to execute

190
00:08:38,979 --> 00:08:41,590
it it document writes something we have

191
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:43,780
to parse the output oh there's another

192
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:45,910
script tag and then we download that and

193
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:48,070
then we basically we enter in our state

194
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:52,660
machine and things become really slow

195
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:56,470
right so the basically what you get in

196
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:58,270
like in JavaScript language is you have

197
00:08:58,270 --> 00:09:00,910
the synchronous xhr that gets to modify

198
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:03,190
the currently parsing document and you

199
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:06,690
and that that is recursive right and

200
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:07,880
it's

201
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:12,170
in strong violation to what I call the

202
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:14,540
the first law of javascript is that they

203
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:18,470
all will eventually be asynchronous if

204
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:19,670
there's like you start our synchronous

205
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:20,960
because there's you only have to do like

206
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,190
one plus one eventually it will be

207
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:25,040
asynchronous but this entire the

208
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,680
semantics of document are right do not

209
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,770
allow anything to ever be asynchronous

210
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:34,400
so even though um every player in the

211
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,750
game might be completely fine with

212
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:38,060
making their stuff asynchronous if

213
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:40,700
anything relies on the synchronous

214
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:45,230
semantics you can't change it and so we

215
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:47,620
get to the opposite is if anything

216
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:50,660
relies on being synchronous obviously

217
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:52,400
every child has to be synchronous there

218
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,620
can't be anything asynchronous and and

219
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:56,560
and the thing is that synchronicity

220
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:01,730
really really doesn't scale so for

221
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:04,250
example um you're like on the website

222
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:05,780
and was like I would like to have a net

223
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:07,730
that's all these synchronous and then

224
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:08,930
but you don't really know how to make

225
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:10,730
add see you this is like another

226
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:12,260
javascript file leg do you know how to

227
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:13,730
make ads that's the synchronous request

228
00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:17,210
and right cause like add source like

229
00:10:17,210 --> 00:10:19,630
many players you like can you help us

230
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:21,620
find out which ad to draw another

231
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:24,680
synchronous request and then because you

232
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:25,610
found out that you make more money

233
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:27,200
that's Wade like let's ask these other

234
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,580
folks over there if they have better at

235
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:31,670
another synchronous request and then

236
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:33,800
they say no no weary soul this to some

237
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:36,440
other party and then they make another

238
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,970
synchronous request and then they

239
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:39,740
finally say okay now we try to figure

240
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:42,200
out how to make ads and it can be a bit

241
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:45,910
early deep which leads to these absurd

242
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:49,130
situations way where web page load times

243
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:50,840
get so slow that you can literally bake

244
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:54,080
cookies during them there's the chrome

245
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,510
team currently has this experiment where

246
00:10:56,510 --> 00:10:58,940
they kill document right if you're on 2g

247
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:01,070
that's already launched and soon they

248
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:03,410
will always do it when you're on a 2g

249
00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:05,960
like connection because you get you get

250
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:09,620
like document dot write like kiss gates

251
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:12,200
are 50 element deep if each request

252
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,450
takes 10 seconds you had 500 second web

253
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:15,860
page load time and you see absolutely

254
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:18,100
nothing at all during this entire time

255
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:22,750
which can't be good for anyone right

256
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:27,410
cool ah so we have how to measure

257
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:28,910
something on-screen how to load

258
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:31,670
something synchronously next is the what

259
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:35,410
I personally found like that was my own

260
00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:37,970
impression was the the most awesome ack

261
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:41,060
hack in JavaScript ever was actually

262
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:43,670
done by Mozilla they may think called

263
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:47,240
Broadway jas and what they built was

264
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,790
this native JavaScript h.264 decoder

265
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:55,280
that was decently fast and so that that

266
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,570
seems like really cool like you can use

267
00:11:56,570 --> 00:11:59,360
JavaScript to decode h.264 I think it's

268
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:03,020
pretty impressive now we need some more

269
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:07,400
context so Chrome Safari both agreed

270
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:10,490
that autoplay as a feature of the video

271
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:12,320
tag wasn't a good thing a noble right

272
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,060
and you can totally understand why they

273
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:15,950
would think this right autoplay means

274
00:12:15,950 --> 00:12:17,300
definitely you have to download the

275
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:21,100
movie file so you incur data costs

276
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:23,660
definitely autoplay with sound can be

277
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:24,950
really awkward like you're on the bus

278
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:27,380
and you thing like place sound that you

279
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:29,300
don't want that so they they make this

280
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:30,350
decision on behalf of the user should

281
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:33,440
say like um you cannot like all the play

282
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,870
video users always have to tap to play

283
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:40,780
video combining this with Broadway jas

284
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:44,660
gets us to this right so some people

285
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:47,480
were like oh well you can't do autoplay

286
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:51,440
but we have a JavaScript side h.264

287
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,000
decoder so we can do autoplay because

288
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,550
that is not subject to any limitations

289
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:58,970
whatsoever and the consequences were

290
00:12:58,970 --> 00:13:01,640
dire you still use the bandwidth

291
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:02,930
obviously because you download the video

292
00:13:02,930 --> 00:13:05,510
now using like xhr you devastate the

293
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:08,540
battery because decoding and JavaScript

294
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:11,240
happens on the cpu this is typically on

295
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:15,740
devices that have you know a decoder in

296
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:17,420
hardware that could do this essentially

297
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:20,810
without using very little battery so

298
00:13:20,810 --> 00:13:22,310
it's running totally on the UI thread

299
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:24,350
the page shanks because it runs on the

300
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:27,020
UI thread and and the worst part of this

301
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:30,980
is that now the legit players on this

302
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:34,070
Web like us basically we want to do

303
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:35,270
autoplay we can we

304
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:37,700
we wouldn't do this but the bad guys can

305
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:41,270
and so this is I think a good example

306
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:44,510
for how you have to be careful with

307
00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:46,490
doing these interventions because the

308
00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:49,130
workarounds which typically do exist

309
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:50,210
once you have a Turing complete

310
00:13:50,210 --> 00:13:53,140
programming language can be much worse

311
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:55,610
all right this is the very dark part of

312
00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:59,060
this talk um I wanted to continue and

313
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:01,760
talk about how we as developers can

314
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:06,230
handle it better my friend may know

315
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:08,060
typically says like let's put on the web

316
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:10,730
wetsuit and jump into the like how

317
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:14,810
can we how come we embrace the bad thing

318
00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:19,580
and at least handle it and as this comes

319
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:22,580
back for when we like basically we're

320
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:24,080
working on amp and we're thinking like

321
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:27,290
how can we you know we this stuff is on

322
00:14:27,290 --> 00:14:28,880
the web we have to deal with it like

323
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:31,430
it's there what can we do and so we

324
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:35,660
decided to basically put all the like 3p

325
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:39,650
code behind this barbed wire fence and

326
00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:41,690
on the web that always means essentially

327
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:46,430
an iframe and and the first thing we did

328
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:48,590
was pretty simple I think it makes a lot

329
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:50,900
of sense which that it once you haven't

330
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:52,490
like something i frame you can decide

331
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:55,340
not to load it load content first then

332
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:57,950
you look everything else let's pray say

333
00:14:57,950 --> 00:15:04,000
forward next part is that what i call a

334
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,930
generally containment right so if if you

335
00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:10,880
need to load someone else's code having

336
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,100
it in an iframe sandbox can be very

337
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:16,010
useful it gives you you know better

338
00:15:16,010 --> 00:15:18,980
security for example in amp when you

339
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:20,930
load an ad it will be on a randomly

340
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:23,000
generated domain right so they can

341
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,100
totally go and set some like local

342
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:27,200
storage but they will never again at

343
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:30,560
least in the time of the current

344
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:33,950
universe that same domain right so that

345
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:36,710
local storage is just gone um and then

346
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:38,000
there's not the middle also means

347
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,170
there's nothing on it that you could

348
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:42,650
hack right you have control of our

349
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:45,500
resizing because like in typically the

350
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,000
third party code you load it into your

351
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,650
page they own everything they can do

352
00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:48,950
whatever

353
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:51,380
they want once it's an iframe they have

354
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:53,120
to ask you like I would like to be

355
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,850
bigger and then you can say no or like

356
00:15:55,850 --> 00:15:59,240
yeah it's cool but it's up to you and I

357
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:02,570
think one of the also not obvious things

358
00:16:02,570 --> 00:16:05,270
is once you have it an iframe you can

359
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:08,720
just kill the iframe so one thing well

360
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,510
if everything's on the same frame you

361
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:13,520
load the JavaScript like it's very it's

362
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:15,260
like you could kill the Dom they render

363
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:17,030
it but all this would still be

364
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:18,740
there they might hold onto references

365
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:20,210
the Dom so it couldn't really be garbage

366
00:16:20,210 --> 00:16:22,550
collected so having an eye from is very

367
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:26,540
clean that you can say ah go away and it

368
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:28,040
really has gone that the memory comes

369
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:31,970
back and the best feature which isn't

370
00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:35,750
completely obvious is that iframes also

371
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:39,470
made a gate documented right so um and

372
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:40,670
this is completely not obvious I think

373
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:42,500
on so if you have a documented right in

374
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:45,110
iframe that doesn't actually have the

375
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:49,240
same blocking behavior on the other page

376
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:52,940
yeah last thing that we do and which we

377
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:54,560
so far haven't really talked about

378
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,060
because it's a kind of a get in mouse

379
00:16:56,060 --> 00:17:00,770
game is that we intervene on behalf of

380
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:04,880
the user so we it's not a thing if you

381
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:05,990
have something I frame you can like

382
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:08,060
globally change everything in it but

383
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:10,130
it's our iframe and so we can throttle

384
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:16,280
timers and probably shouldn't use these

385
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,540
words because they sound really

386
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:20,000
dangerous but basically what there is so

387
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,620
there's code in that I frame that says

388
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:23,839
oh you made another child iframe i'm

389
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:26,360
going to go there and do the same thing

390
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:28,700
and what I'm doing is I am throttling

391
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:32,960
timers so I like I'm going to show code

392
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,580
for that so basically if something's not

393
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:37,130
on screen like why should you be able to

394
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:39,080
like call set interval with like 16

395
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:40,760
milliseconds right it doesn't really

396
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:43,190
make sense um but they do it all the

397
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:47,360
time so we have code like this and its

398
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:50,810
really like this is really dirty so one

399
00:17:50,810 --> 00:17:52,760
like basically there's just one example

400
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:55,490
there's like five similar monkey

401
00:17:55,490 --> 00:17:57,830
patching functions that go through all

402
00:17:57,830 --> 00:18:00,740
the various ways how you could create an

403
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:01,910
iframe

404
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:04,340
and one of them is that you create an

405
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:06,080
iframe but a new document right into the

406
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,550
iframe there's actually a legit use of

407
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:09,650
document right but in this case you have

408
00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:12,650
to call document close and so we monkey

409
00:18:12,650 --> 00:18:15,500
patch it we eventually call the original

410
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:18,320
but we basically be just before calling

411
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,480
that close we documented write another

412
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,730
script tag into the iframe and basically

413
00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:26,570
recursively call us to run that same

414
00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:28,880
kind of we call it manage it's like a

415
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:32,600
nice word for like 40 link timers so we

416
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,730
go into a recursive time I frame and and

417
00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:37,040
run the same code again and again and

418
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:39,800
the actual code looks like this so again

419
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:42,710
we monkey patch set timeout in this case

420
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:44,270
and there's like similar code for like

421
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:46,550
set interval requestanimationframe and

422
00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:50,630
in various cases in there and so x is

423
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:52,730
one of the simplest one so we basically

424
00:18:52,730 --> 00:18:55,610
just forward the set time a call to the

425
00:18:55,610 --> 00:18:58,100
system set timeout but before doing so

426
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:02,780
we we overwrite the time at least

427
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:05,120
potentially the second function is the

428
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,860
function we actually have so what we

429
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:11,540
saying is if you're in viewport you get

430
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:13,460
whatever time you want it but if you're

431
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:15,740
not in viewport we'll just add a second

432
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:18,980
to whatever you ask it makes sense to

433
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:20,570
always add a second because that means

434
00:19:20,570 --> 00:19:22,430
the order that they expect is still the

435
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:24,020
same right you go from like 10

436
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:27,350
milliseconds to 1010 or went from like

437
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:28,850
even if they ask for 10 which will be

438
00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:31,070
legit they get 11 so that's kind of like

439
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:33,110
doesn't really matter we wouldn't have

440
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:34,850
cared but at least the orders now as

441
00:19:34,850 --> 00:19:38,150
expected and so so all of these things

442
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:39,980
together really make a difference so we

443
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:42,560
I particularly saw this ad that was

444
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:46,040
using this like Bravo ajs style h.264

445
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:49,250
decoding and it was um even if the ad

446
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:51,890
was invisible the page was basically

447
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:55,820
unusable and with this code the page is

448
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:58,070
only in visit unusable when you see the

449
00:19:58,070 --> 00:20:00,170
ad which is actually a big step forward

450
00:20:00,170 --> 00:20:01,550
because you can start reading everything

451
00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:03,650
else and you can like scroll away

452
00:20:03,650 --> 00:20:05,030
because it's like almost as big as the

453
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:08,470
screen and then everything works again

454
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:13,930
right and and so

455
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:16,909
we the questions like whether we

456
00:20:16,909 --> 00:20:18,350
actually went to the AP website and

457
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:21,620
licensed this picture which you can I

458
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:27,860
learned yes are we done I you know I

459
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:30,710
think that like this type of mitigation

460
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:33,620
where you handle someone else's code is

461
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:35,600
very very important because third-party

462
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,909
javascript is everywhere and like you

463
00:20:37,909 --> 00:20:39,230
totally want to show some tweet

464
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:41,990
somewhere right and that's fine um so

465
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:43,730
it's not something that's going to go

466
00:20:43,730 --> 00:20:46,580
away and that's why I think it's

467
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:48,200
important to talk about how you can

468
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:52,730
handle it but in the I think in the

469
00:20:52,730 --> 00:20:55,070
particular ads case we can actually do

470
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:57,860
better so I again like I'm obviously

471
00:20:57,860 --> 00:20:59,750
working at Google we do render some of

472
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:02,149
the ads in the internet so I think like

473
00:21:02,149 --> 00:21:05,990
my team is both the privilege and the in

474
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:08,659
some words responsibility to actually

475
00:21:08,659 --> 00:21:12,529
fix it so I'm not actually going to dive

476
00:21:12,529 --> 00:21:15,799
into what exactly we're going to do but

477
00:21:15,799 --> 00:21:19,700
I I did write a long blog post about

478
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:23,090
this a bit ly flash and for as the

479
00:21:23,090 --> 00:21:25,639
number of ads for our details for the

480
00:21:25,639 --> 00:21:28,940
long term plan so basically while there

481
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:30,289
still will be JavaScript around

482
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:33,100
everywhere we're super super hopeful

483
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:38,289
that we can at least have a more like

484
00:21:38,289 --> 00:21:41,029
like a healthier at advertising

485
00:21:41,029 --> 00:21:43,509
ecosystem were like you don't have to

486
00:21:43,509 --> 00:21:45,980
mitigate them like everyone's kind of a

487
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:48,700
legit player yeah that's all I have

488
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:51,200
again I'm melta crime force on on

489
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,269
Twitter github etcetera thank you very
