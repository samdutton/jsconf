00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:10,740

Thanks having you I'm going to talk

2
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:13,440
about happiness and about making your

3
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:17,430
CSS happy and give me a few minutes to

4
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:20,760
to tell you what I mean with that i'm a

5
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,290
bit unsure about my audience today i had

6
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:23,850
very very detailed questions around

7
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:29,220
lunch so i've tried to not dive too much

8
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:32,040
tin to the details but also don't want

9
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:33,870
to make it boring so do give me feedback

10
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:39,480
early enough you'll see SS do you guys

11
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:42,450
know whether your CSS is happy or if

12
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:48,210
it's sad or maybe worse really really

13
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:50,130
broken you guys know this this is the

14
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:54,030
acid test as a to test this is ie7 it

15
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:58,380
might be a bad example but i wonder what

16
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:01,230
i want to say is um do you guys are you

17
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:02,670
guys really sure that the CSS you're

18
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:05,580
developing is looking good and I like to

19
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:07,740
just see hands who are you guys are you

20
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:09,210
guys really confident that what you're

21
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:10,770
developing is really looking good on all

22
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:12,690
browsers can I see some hands who's very

23
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:14,400
confident who's confident who's

24
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,710
confident just basic confident that it's

25
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:19,440
working well what is developing somebody

26
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:22,350
over there so there should be a bit more

27
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:23,549
people around here right because we're

28
00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:25,440
all professionals and we billing

29
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:30,320
customers clients people of our work so

30
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:33,240
it's kind of sad it makes me happy

31
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:34,590
because it kind of motivates what I'm

32
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:40,110
talking about today so we users when we

33
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:43,290
visit website we find out about problems

34
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:45,960
right we see them and that could be

35
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:47,850
something very simple see facebook or

36
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:49,530
github as an example where there's a

37
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:51,780
weird line break happening stuff like

38
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:53,460
that we is it looks kind of

39
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:56,659
unprofessional but we can work with that

40
00:01:56,659 --> 00:01:59,909
then there's worse problems like a hot

41
00:01:59,909 --> 00:02:01,979
or something hovering over my elements I

42
00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:04,170
can't even see what's happening or maybe

43
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:05,759
my papa I don't know if you can see that

44
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:07,609
with the red arrows over there my whole

45
00:02:07,609 --> 00:02:10,169
my whole pop-up is not really short

46
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:12,590
they're showing so that

47
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:16,209
that's not something I want or

48
00:02:16,209 --> 00:02:20,500
thankfully Elliot this morning is

49
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:24,379
playing with the twitter feed he added a

50
00:02:24,379 --> 00:02:28,510
unique code 202 sorry 22 e which is

51
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:34,190
forced right-to-left writing control

52
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:36,590
code in Unicode everything that follows

53
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:38,540
our character forces the text to be

54
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:40,310
rendered from right to left sounds

55
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:41,840
stupid but if you write a rabbit for

56
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,030
example which is a writing system from

57
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:45,680
written from right to left this is a

58
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,810
usual useful function well if you put it

59
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:49,819
into your username so Elliot cables

60
00:02:49,819 --> 00:02:51,680
username is a unicode character plus

61
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,450
plus the string then everything but

62
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:56,269
behind that is in the in the wrong order

63
00:02:56,269 --> 00:03:00,440
so you see Elliot cable and CSS conf

64
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:04,040
retweeted you just wrong direction so I

65
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:06,410
say do they really want to have that I

66
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:08,750
think Twitter should fix their their

67
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:10,730
problem I think I think that's a problem

68
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:12,349
and they might not even be aware of that

69
00:03:12,349 --> 00:03:17,510
so and to tell you one story of my past

70
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:21,440
I've been on teams where I kind of

71
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:24,470
inherited the front end role I don't

72
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:26,480
believe in roles i think we people

73
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:30,440
should have multiple abilities but some

74
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:32,359
teams they were like old-school

75
00:03:32,359 --> 00:03:33,739
developers you're going to just be a

76
00:03:33,739 --> 00:03:35,810
front end guy well old-school developers

77
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:38,599
are good they have all the testing tools

78
00:03:38,599 --> 00:03:40,579
they know what they're doing on the team

79
00:03:40,579 --> 00:03:43,220
i went on i had to do the CSS and the

80
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:45,079
HTML and I kept it kept breaking all the

81
00:03:45,079 --> 00:03:48,049
time and nobody found out it took some

82
00:03:48,049 --> 00:03:50,060
time it was not I don't believe it was

83
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:51,650
because I was bad it was just I didn't

84
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:53,720
have the tools for the job to make sure

85
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,489
that stuff I developed was still working

86
00:03:55,489 --> 00:03:56,840
two weeks later with somebody else

87
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:59,720
change something so what I think what's

88
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:03,139
kind of missing is a safety net I hope I

89
00:04:03,139 --> 00:04:04,819
kind of motivated why we need something

90
00:04:04,819 --> 00:04:06,349
like that I showed you a few two

91
00:04:06,349 --> 00:04:08,599
examples where it breaks this was my

92
00:04:08,599 --> 00:04:10,220
revelation after a few weeks on the job

93
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:11,750
it's like I don't have a safety net all

94
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:13,669
my other developers have a safety net if

95
00:04:13,669 --> 00:04:15,919
they write Java they have tools and

96
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:19,880
basically CSS exists since forever and

97
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,979
we don't have so far don't really know

98
00:04:21,979 --> 00:04:25,860
how to test it talking a bit about

99
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:28,199
being professional it's a bit loaded

100
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:32,520
term what I want to say is we all I

101
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,590
think all people sitting here do wonder

102
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:37,860
you guys want to give maximum you want

103
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:40,349
to do the best and give the quality the

104
00:04:40,349 --> 00:04:41,789
best quality to your clients and

105
00:04:41,789 --> 00:04:45,539
customers but CSS is getting much more

106
00:04:45,539 --> 00:04:47,039
complex by the year we're adding more

107
00:04:47,039 --> 00:04:48,719
features luckily where we are very happy

108
00:04:48,719 --> 00:04:52,530
four colors and HSV and stuff but it's

109
00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:54,780
getting more complex we are we now have

110
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:57,569
responsive design that means that mobile

111
00:04:57,569 --> 00:05:00,270
phone that tab that computer the pages

112
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:02,539
are getting larger and smarter and nicer

113
00:05:02,539 --> 00:05:05,129
more devices and multiple browsers I

114
00:05:05,129 --> 00:05:06,870
don't know how you guys do do that but

115
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:08,400
if you chase something do you guys visit

116
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,740
all the 20 devices that you should look

117
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:13,469
good on possibly not and even if it

118
00:05:13,469 --> 00:05:15,750
might break anytime and it you won't

119
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:19,809
possibly recheck every every time

120
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:23,189
testing testing is a solution to that

121
00:05:23,189 --> 00:05:25,979
problem software developers have had

122
00:05:25,979 --> 00:05:27,960
tooling for a long time I'm kind of

123
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,639
sorry I'm very bad as sketching my

124
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:32,400
handwriting is awful but what I want to

125
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,990
show here is very example web stack

126
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:38,539
maybe you guys have something similar

127
00:05:38,539 --> 00:05:41,909
there is a UI on top it's written in CSS

128
00:05:41,909 --> 00:05:43,919
HTML there's some JavaScript that does

129
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:45,599
something that we rearrange the Dom does

130
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:48,330
something and there's then client logic

131
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:49,529
below that does some business logic

132
00:05:49,529 --> 00:05:50,969
maybe sale in the browser there's

133
00:05:50,969 --> 00:05:52,740
several object may be written in kno jes

134
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:55,379
and for the most sophisticated websites

135
00:05:55,379 --> 00:05:57,060
there might be a ninja Nick's server

136
00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:00,060
sitting below and MongoDB database or

137
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:03,750
whatever we want to test out if you're

138
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:04,919
sitting on a team with hundred twenty

139
00:06:04,919 --> 00:06:07,080
developers and you need to read

140
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:09,629
frequently and you have million visitors

141
00:06:09,629 --> 00:06:14,639
per day and we working on a big you shop

142
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:17,879
in Hamburg they make a mass amount of

143
00:06:17,879 --> 00:06:19,229
money every every day is if something

144
00:06:19,229 --> 00:06:21,150
breaks you can see we have all those

145
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:22,770
graphs so suddenly you deploy your life

146
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:24,000
and suddenly the audio drops and

147
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,500
management's manage management comes in

148
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,089
and says we're losing money by the

149
00:06:27,089 --> 00:06:30,479
minute that's why we're using we as

150
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:32,789
developers we're using the tools can I

151
00:06:32,789 --> 00:06:34,889
so that selenium as an example can I ask

152
00:06:34,889 --> 00:06:37,050
sexy can i see hands who is using

153
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:39,409
selenium or knows what this is

154
00:06:39,409 --> 00:06:42,259
okay that's that's a fair number so

155
00:06:42,259 --> 00:06:45,169
selenium is basically just browse a tool

156
00:06:45,169 --> 00:06:47,479
for the ones who haven't heard just a

157
00:06:47,479 --> 00:06:49,939
tool that takes a browser and clicks

158
00:06:49,939 --> 00:06:52,309
through things and allowed to formulate

159
00:06:52,309 --> 00:06:55,039
assertions other other ways of doing it

160
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:57,889
is writing small vanilla unit tests what

161
00:06:57,889 --> 00:07:02,149
I what I finally found out was there is

162
00:07:02,149 --> 00:07:04,969
no there's nothing I believe there's

163
00:07:04,969 --> 00:07:06,709
nothing that really helps me with

164
00:07:06,709 --> 00:07:10,489
exactly that thing CSS and HTML I could

165
00:07:10,489 --> 00:07:11,989
I could start watching selenium tests

166
00:07:11,989 --> 00:07:14,059
that make sure that the color of that

167
00:07:14,059 --> 00:07:16,639
button is blue but if you guys have if

168
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:19,550
the guys who are here who have written

169
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:22,639
selenium it's um it's an I can't say

170
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:23,929
anything bad about it because it was

171
00:07:23,929 --> 00:07:26,479
kind of started by my company I work for

172
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:29,839
but it's an awful tool to write very

173
00:07:29,839 --> 00:07:33,249
implying granular things it's more for

174
00:07:33,249 --> 00:07:35,119
functional aspects for what the user

175
00:07:35,119 --> 00:07:36,679
wants for the user journey what you want

176
00:07:36,679 --> 00:07:43,599
to test there is no tools for that but

177
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:45,709
why am I telling you all this because

178
00:07:45,709 --> 00:07:49,189
there is a way since 12 years ago there

179
00:07:49,189 --> 00:07:50,929
are few people starting to look into

180
00:07:50,929 --> 00:07:53,599
that problem we now realize slowly that

181
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,519
there is a problem that needs fixing and

182
00:07:55,519 --> 00:07:58,339
there are some solutions to that and to

183
00:07:58,339 --> 00:08:00,919
motivate how such a solution could look

184
00:08:00,919 --> 00:08:04,429
like I want to show you a tool start

185
00:08:04,429 --> 00:08:05,539
with one and maybe give you a short

186
00:08:05,539 --> 00:08:07,009
overview what else is out there on the

187
00:08:07,009 --> 00:08:09,259
market I hope by now that you guys kind

188
00:08:09,259 --> 00:08:11,119
of agree with me about this yes it is

189
00:08:11,119 --> 00:08:12,889
bad I want to know what's going on and

190
00:08:12,889 --> 00:08:14,179
if if I if I break something

191
00:08:14,179 --> 00:08:15,769
accidentally I want to find out about it

192
00:08:15,769 --> 00:08:23,929
so simple demo that's about the button I

193
00:08:23,929 --> 00:08:26,779
styled it it's just a black border 1

194
00:08:26,779 --> 00:08:29,179
pixel it has some with a bigger text

195
00:08:29,179 --> 00:08:32,990
that's just my application I my HTML and

196
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:39,500
CSS I want to test this is a very simple

197
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,569
CSS testing solution I'm going to talk

198
00:08:41,569 --> 00:08:44,029
about it later on a bit more just I want

199
00:08:44,029 --> 00:08:45,709
to describe what you see here this is

200
00:08:45,709 --> 00:08:47,360
the button that you've seen before

201
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,870
rendered that's a screenshot there is um

202
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:52,580
it's yellow because it says this

203
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:56,600
test is still not defined basically I

204
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:59,570
have a rendered screenshot what I now

205
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:01,520
need to say for that tool to work to do

206
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,980
its job I need to say this is the image

207
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:07,280
that I want to keep so the tool works in

208
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,010
such a way that you take a screenshot

209
00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:12,440
and you fix it you say the screen child

210
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:14,480
is the target I want to keep that and if

211
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,550
it breaks do tell me this is what i'm

212
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:17,840
going to do so i'm just going to click

213
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:20,870
that a green button here and I just now

214
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:23,870
set that image to be the true image and

215
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:26,630
if it changes do tell me if I reload the

216
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:27,890
page I don't know if you guys know

217
00:09:27,890 --> 00:09:31,010
Jasmine a testing tool it kind of its

218
00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:32,720
kind of inspired by Jasmine where you

219
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,430
just open the browser and rerun the test

220
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:38,180
so there you go that's very easy trick

221
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:39,440
right I just click the button now it's

222
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,360
green I'm not sure whether you guys

223
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,390
believe me so I can I can break that

224
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:47,360
test so I can rerun this it's going to

225
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:51,980
be green sort of sort of the cameraman

226
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:53,990
who now has to refocus for me just going

227
00:09:53,990 --> 00:10:00,170
to be very short yes I keep using shift

228
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:01,570
for that but it doesn't work and sublime

229
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:05,360
yeah do one job anyway so I'm going to

230
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:08,750
change the border from so please don't

231
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:10,820
love my CSS I'm really really bad as CSS

232
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:12,470
that's why my slides are all in white

233
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:16,220
and black so I'm going to change that to

234
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:20,480
yellow autosave enabled we're going to

235
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,510
rerun the tests on pressing command are

236
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:24,890
they go the tool finds out that

237
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:27,920
something has changed what it does it

238
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,110
gives me a definite that's one way of

239
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:31,340
rendering there are other ways but

240
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:32,930
that's it just gives me a black canvas

241
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:35,540
and says here's the that's the area that

242
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:38,390
has changed those other anything that's

243
00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:40,340
not black has changed and if you see

244
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:42,260
here the current page is yellow over the

245
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:45,860
ball is yellow that one is black so this

246
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:47,360
tool helps me to quickly find out with

247
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,430
something changes I think that's a start

248
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:52,760
so what do we do right now I have a red

249
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,950
test the test says this this is not

250
00:10:54,950 --> 00:10:56,390
going to go to a production you have to

251
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:58,910
do something about it so let's say the

252
00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:00,800
yellow border was not intended i'm going

253
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:04,820
to just revert my change there you go

254
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:06,270
it's going to get

255
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:10,180
so this is this tool now allows me to be

256
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:12,340
notified whenever something changes it's

257
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:14,260
it the test can't tell you whether it's

258
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:16,240
good about it just says something

259
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,460
changed can you please hausa manual

260
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:20,260
intervention here and tell me how I

261
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:22,210
should proceed so let's do an

262
00:11:22,210 --> 00:11:25,570
intentional change let's say the

263
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:28,960
background color for example so if I'm

264
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:31,450
going to go to yellow here sorry for the

265
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:33,310
audio i think around here it's a bit bit

266
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:37,090
too loud trying to be be careful they go

267
00:11:37,090 --> 00:11:39,280
i changed the background from white to

268
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:42,040
yellow the color blue stems from there

269
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:45,450
is a math apps calculation and it just

270
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:47,260
blew is just the difference between

271
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:49,810
white and yellow apparently so let's say

272
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:52,390
the yellow is the improved design that's

273
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:55,360
version 2 and I was told me as a

274
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,100
developer was told to please make it

275
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:59,230
yellow so I need to tell the tool there

276
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:02,200
you go except this rear ender and we're

277
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,810
good to go and if I hover over this you

278
00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:07,360
can see it now has the yellow button so

279
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,720
that is a very very simple tool and a

280
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,760
very simple way of giving you kind of a

281
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:15,430
safety net and I hope that is very very

282
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:18,700
clear right now the screenshot is a very

283
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:20,770
simple way to tap into my CSS it's not

284
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:23,080
just CSS there's HTML involved it gets

285
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,430
more complicated when that JavaScript

286
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:26,980
involved but that's doable but it gives

287
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:30,670
me a way of tracking changes now I'm so

288
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:31,900
lucky that I'm not the first or the

289
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:33,430
first talk doing the first talk today

290
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:35,620
because it was very the first one but

291
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:37,390
Nicole was very interesting to me she

292
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:40,030
described working on a project where

293
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:42,010
they needed to change the UI nobody

294
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:43,630
trusted the existing implementation

295
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:46,210
nobody felt they were up for the job and

296
00:12:46,210 --> 00:12:48,339
I had some similar experiences although

297
00:12:48,339 --> 00:12:51,010
not in that big big range if you have

298
00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:54,339
such a tool it could support you moving

299
00:12:54,339 --> 00:12:56,350
over to something without a rewrite for

300
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:59,980
example so I'm definitely going to start

301
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:03,760
doing what we call was talking about

302
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:06,040
this morning but I still want to have a

303
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:07,870
safety net this one could help you

304
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:11,110
provide you something around refactoring

305
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:14,560
you could add some tests change the code

306
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,750
make it nicer but still have the output

307
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:18,800
the same and this tool will tell you

308
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:23,959
good so so what we can track we can

309
00:13:23,959 --> 00:13:27,170
check the changes in CSS screenshots is

310
00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:30,230
the solution used here tests don't tell

311
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:31,370
you that something broke there just to

312
00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:34,070
change notification and basically what

313
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:37,100
the tool does is you don't need to do

314
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:41,899
manual testing on all your HTML you

315
00:13:41,899 --> 00:13:43,100
don't need to go through all your pages

316
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:45,050
and look at everything if you have tests

317
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:46,880
for the important part it's going to

318
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,860
tell you what you need to look at so it

319
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:51,140
kind of boils down down to but once

320
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:53,899
develop a change is something he or she

321
00:13:53,899 --> 00:13:55,370
should then check whether the tests are

322
00:13:55,370 --> 00:13:58,370
still green and if not maybe generate a

323
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:02,329
new reference image so I'd say much

324
00:14:02,329 --> 00:14:04,130
leaner way of moving forward and

325
00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:06,260
rechecking that's things are working so

326
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:08,839
the tool i just showed to you is called

327
00:14:08,839 --> 00:14:11,450
CSS critic i'm a bit biased because i'm

328
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:15,050
the guy behind that it's a very very

329
00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:18,260
simple tool the motivation is make it

330
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:20,180
that simple to start off it's basically

331
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:21,829
just an NPM package you just install it

332
00:14:21,829 --> 00:14:25,310
and the idea is use the browser who is

333
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:28,220
the browser is the software that renders

334
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:29,990
we shot why can't I just do the testing

335
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:32,000
tool in the Bowser and I could get the

336
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,790
visual feedback in the browser so if any

337
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:35,990
other developers that the quickest

338
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:38,000
feedback I can get there are other smart

339
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,270
tools so rate for example not sure

340
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:42,529
whether it's the correct pronunciation

341
00:14:42,529 --> 00:14:46,790
is it's a I think the Scottish word for

342
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:51,709
Ghost Wraith is it's done by the BBC

343
00:14:51,709 --> 00:14:54,050
News team who have a very special

344
00:14:54,050 --> 00:14:56,390
problem the BBC News team they have

345
00:14:56,390 --> 00:14:58,190
change in content all the time every

346
00:14:58,190 --> 00:14:59,450
second there's some more things

347
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:02,360
happening in the world and what they

348
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:05,360
need to do is when they deploy still

349
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,829
make sure that the content is the same

350
00:15:06,829 --> 00:15:08,510
but they can't so I just showed your

351
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:10,190
static images before right I fix an

352
00:15:10,190 --> 00:15:11,870
image and maybe it's going to stay the

353
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:14,870
same for a year but with BBC because

354
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:16,519
their content is changing they have are

355
00:15:16,519 --> 00:15:18,380
the problems so what they are doing is

356
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:20,810
they just have a pre post deployment

357
00:15:20,810 --> 00:15:22,640
before they deployed a live with a new

358
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:25,310
solution they are using the staging

359
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:26,839
environment taking a screenshot using a

360
00:15:26,839 --> 00:15:28,790
life environment and see what changes so

361
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:30,610
the person who clicks the deploy button

362
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:32,540
or who needs to go through

363
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:34,340
20 pages reference for deploying an

364
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:38,210
application needs to can has a handy

365
00:15:38,210 --> 00:15:40,550
tool of finding out what changes so I

366
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:44,870
think that is a very very I likely I did

367
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:46,430
behind that it's a very very smart move

368
00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:48,320
for very specific problems that they

369
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:53,030
have then there's phantom CSS IE i

370
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:54,890
personally describe phantom CSS as the

371
00:15:54,890 --> 00:15:58,340
entry drug to CSS testing because if you

372
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:00,770
guys know selenium phantom CSS is

373
00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:02,630
basically similar it's using Casper Jes

374
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:04,730
you guys know maybe know that on phantom

375
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:08,180
Jes all you do is you tell Phantom which

376
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:10,040
is a headless browser to go here click

377
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:12,560
there and then if the correct state is

378
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:15,950
there take a screenshot similar to the

379
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:17,180
other two solutions it's working on

380
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:20,450
screen shots phantom CSS is done by the

381
00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:22,910
huddle team they have a kind of

382
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:26,630
different differing image but basically

383
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:28,280
if you look down here that's sorry it's

384
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:31,040
a bit too small that's the syntax how

385
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:36,710
they work you're just sorry that was

386
00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:39,770
wrong it's basically click through the

387
00:16:39,770 --> 00:16:42,140
page click on elements and once you find

388
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:43,580
a state that you want to test you take

389
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:46,280
take a screenshot with like selenium

390
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:49,400
there are other solutions I don't want

391
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,740
to spend too much time on this because

392
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:53,840
there's a lot a lot a lot of things one

393
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:56,990
interesting thing might be the hardy

394
00:16:56,990 --> 00:16:58,850
hardy by Simon who is sadly not here

395
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:00,680
today I think he was planning to talk to

396
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:05,390
which I love to hear howdy is different

397
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:07,660
that it doesn't do screenshots it does

398
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:11,510
allow you to test your single elements

399
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:12,650
on the page instead of taking a

400
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:14,330
screenshot you do tell me whether that

401
00:17:14,330 --> 00:17:17,390
h1 element still has font size 15 or

402
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:19,280
something so it's a very different way

403
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,870
of doing that and there are a lot of

404
00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:23,210
different solutions and if you're

405
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:25,670
interested in that Simon runs this

406
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:28,970
webpage csst EST since I test and

407
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:31,460
there's a long list of tools and content

408
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:33,830
and examples that's something that's an

409
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:37,210
awesome resource to start start with

410
00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:39,920
I've used it last year on a project so

411
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:41,360
my problem is I work on different

412
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,340
projects over time I'm not staying very

413
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:45,070
long sadly this is with

414
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:47,680
company i'm working with but i did on

415
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,060
the free month project it was a

416
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:50,410
greenfield project we needed to deliver

417
00:17:50,410 --> 00:17:52,660
after 3 month the time was fixed it was

418
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:55,690
going further chess championship we

419
00:17:55,690 --> 00:17:59,230
didn't have we didn't have any time to

420
00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:01,420
couldn't you know shifted it had to be

421
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:05,590
fixed for that for that date and we

422
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:07,960
managed to deliver without visual

423
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:10,810
defects we had a safety net I could tell

424
00:18:10,810 --> 00:18:13,480
any every commit was tested and you

425
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:14,980
could quickly see whether something

426
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:17,620
changed and it worked pretty well for me

427
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:20,710
and the team what was interesting for me

428
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:22,930
you can drive out new I tests through

429
00:18:22,930 --> 00:18:26,100
through that I don't know if you guys I

430
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:29,470
had to work on a shopping basket which

431
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:31,390
was very complex you had to add elements

432
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:33,010
of the shopping basket so whenever I

433
00:18:33,010 --> 00:18:34,630
needed to touch the shopping basket and

434
00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:36,070
change the shopping basket there was

435
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:37,480
like oh I first have to put 10 articles

436
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:39,460
to find that each case where there's t

437
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:41,830
10 articles and that needs to be what

438
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:43,600
some button that says more something

439
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:46,570
that was very awful to set up all the

440
00:18:46,570 --> 00:18:47,740
time I don't know how you guys did with

441
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:50,050
that problem but if you first define a

442
00:18:50,050 --> 00:18:52,840
test case with that come up with a mock

443
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:56,260
HTML structure then you can just iterate

444
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:58,990
on on the test and come up with a

445
00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:00,520
screenshot and that's wake faster

446
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:01,900
develop something then just tell up your

447
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:03,700
server and add some stuff through the

448
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:06,000
shopping basket in their example

449
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,430
screenshots seen towards our be crazy

450
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:13,210
right if you know if you ask if you ask

451
00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:14,590
old school developers it's like

452
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:16,750
screenshots can't be about a testing

453
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:19,150
tool it's like we test x values we test

454
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:20,950
that something has value we test that

455
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:23,520
the HTTP return code has value to 100

456
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:26,230
and screechers do have a problem they

457
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:28,480
are they can be flaky so BBC have that

458
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,520
problem BBC News if you have changing

459
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:32,110
content the screenshot changes all the

460
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:33,160
time and you don't want to be bothered

461
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:35,080
by changing content all the time you did

462
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:37,000
only one you want to have the test go

463
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,710
green if nothing changed don't want to

464
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:40,780
be you know annoyed by testing ever

465
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:43,360
changing content renderings at the

466
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:46,990
second point are unique snowflakes my

467
00:19:46,990 --> 00:19:48,130
browser renders different than your

468
00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:51,730
browser you even if we have the same

469
00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:53,500
firefox new you might have fun to

470
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:56,080
install that I don't you might work on a

471
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,520
new mac edition with a different font

472
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,390
rendering engine

473
00:19:58,390 --> 00:20:00,970
back so you can't even you can't use the

474
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:05,380
pages to cooperate with York that the

475
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:07,240
guy next to you on the team so there are

476
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,640
some problems i still need some solving

477
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:12,060
but i think it's ready for prime time

478
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:14,520
what i say there are different solutions

479
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:19,410
go find out what works for you guys i

480
00:20:19,410 --> 00:20:22,300
have 10 minutes left I think we also

481
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:25,090
would be happy to start up with an ex

482
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:28,210
talk earlier i had some very particular

483
00:20:28,210 --> 00:20:30,520
questions before so I don't know whether

484
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:32,560
that was all boring because you heard

485
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:33,970
about this before there were some talks

486
00:20:33,970 --> 00:20:37,270
last year about this topic I was hope I

487
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:39,190
I wanted to give like a short

488
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:40,390
introduction into that topic some

489
00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:43,930
motivation of show you one tool and I

490
00:20:43,930 --> 00:20:45,460
could go into more details but maybe you

491
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:55,450
guys have some questions

492
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:58,200
you can throw everything added so so the

493
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,490
question was does it need to be single

494
00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:01,410
elements you can throw everything at it

495
00:21:01,410 --> 00:21:02,520
you could basically throw a whole

496
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:05,010
webpage at it in that case but I don't

497
00:21:05,010 --> 00:21:21,539
think it would like to

498
00:21:21,549 --> 00:21:23,769
so we started a style guide questions

499
00:21:23,769 --> 00:21:25,659
about style guide including that into

500
00:21:25,659 --> 00:21:26,649
the test and I think that's the

501
00:21:26,649 --> 00:21:29,259
brilliant idea because I wouldn't add

502
00:21:29,259 --> 00:21:32,409
the halls got style guide page 22 to the

503
00:21:32,409 --> 00:21:34,179
test I would create a single test for

504
00:21:34,179 --> 00:21:35,619
every element in your style guide so you

505
00:21:35,619 --> 00:21:37,869
know exactly what breaks but guess so

506
00:21:37,869 --> 00:21:39,159
that's that's basically where I came

507
00:21:39,159 --> 00:21:42,220
that's where I started off I was asked

508
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:43,480
to create a style guide and that was

509
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:45,070
like I build a test page and I thought

510
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:46,779
that test page isn't that beautiful I

511
00:21:46,779 --> 00:21:49,629
can exactly see if something changes I

512
00:21:49,629 --> 00:21:50,769
don't have to click to the shopping

513
00:21:50,769 --> 00:21:53,320
basket on page 10 to find out and then I

514
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:55,450
thought why do i do I have to check it

515
00:21:55,450 --> 00:21:58,359
I'm ball I'm easily bored and I need the

516
00:21:58,359 --> 00:22:07,159
computer to do that for me and so yeah

517
00:22:07,169 --> 00:22:10,210
so I don't know whether there's any of

518
00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:11,590
that solution is doing cross browser for

519
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:13,960
now and so you definitely can't take the

520
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,399
screenshot from Firefox and compared to

521
00:22:15,399 --> 00:22:17,799
Chrome especially because you might have

522
00:22:17,799 --> 00:22:19,629
different fallback features what is

523
00:22:19,629 --> 00:22:20,830
there's a new feature in chrome you like

524
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:22,210
to support but firefox doesn't it

525
00:22:22,210 --> 00:22:24,399
doesn't do it yet or vice versa they're

526
00:22:24,399 --> 00:22:25,929
the renderings are going to be difficult

527
00:22:25,929 --> 00:22:27,940
as I said there's no flakes so there is

528
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:30,070
a problem with that and I don't think

529
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:31,960
any of those tools tackle that but then

530
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,909
I have limited knowledge about that but

531
00:22:33,909 --> 00:22:35,559
that's I think that's definitely

532
00:22:35,559 --> 00:22:37,029
something you could go into in the

533
00:22:37,029 --> 00:22:38,019
future and it's something we should

534
00:22:38,019 --> 00:22:39,669
tackle because I think that's one of our

535
00:22:39,669 --> 00:22:41,859
major pain point i would even say that

536
00:22:41,859 --> 00:22:43,059
i'm myself which some time goes live

537
00:22:43,059 --> 00:22:45,989
without somebody checking about in ie9

538
00:22:45,989 --> 00:22:54,750
you had a question sorry fine

539
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:58,880
yes so I'm a bit so i just gave you what

540
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,980
I just showed you was the tool i'm

541
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:04,430
developing which is that one to give you

542
00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:06,380
an idea how how that would look like i

543
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:07,490
don't know if you guys know that to do

544
00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:09,080
MVC application which is an awesome

545
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:11,120
application demo application to a test

546
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:14,330
different NBC tool for javascript this

547
00:23:14,330 --> 00:23:16,400
is my vision of how our unit how would

548
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:20,600
test the UI for that and to answer your

549
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:24,140
question what I what I had was we have

550
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:26,090
the project I was on we had three big

551
00:23:26,090 --> 00:23:28,010
monitors on the wall we didn't even know

552
00:23:28,010 --> 00:23:29,510
what the shell on those money tolls so I

553
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:30,980
did was just open the browser like that

554
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:32,810
put it on that monitor and every time

555
00:23:32,810 --> 00:23:35,900
the test failed I logged in by accession

556
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:37,580
and clicked or something like that it's

557
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:40,100
still kind of not the goal world like to

558
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:42,320
go but it's something that that was

559
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,630
useful and if you have a monitor if you

560
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:46,820
have UI tests which are inherently

561
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:48,860
visual it's good to have the money to

562
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:52,010
show you what changed unlike having some

563
00:23:52,010 --> 00:23:54,290
wit output saying like your screenshot

564
00:23:54,290 --> 00:23:56,240
does not look the same anymore because

565
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,350
that's the only other option that you

566
00:23:57,350 --> 00:24:00,200
have and so just to show you some

567
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:02,690
examples another huge fan that's maybe a

568
00:24:02,690 --> 00:24:04,940
bit more details that I was asked about

569
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:06,440
around lunch there are a lot of other

570
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:08,630
tools for example I didn't talk about I

571
00:24:08,630 --> 00:24:10,190
think it's called depicted which is just

572
00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:13,750
a lot of the proper pronunciation for DX

573
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:18,140
sorry DX d DP sorry whatever um and it's

574
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:21,620
using in a very it uses an algorithm to

575
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:24,290
find out what the weather it friend us

576
00:24:24,290 --> 00:24:27,200
differently from my perspective what I'm

577
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,840
trying to solve is pixel a

578
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:32,360
pixel-by-pixel comparison what I want to

579
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:34,190
do is you might call that crazy but I

580
00:24:34,190 --> 00:24:35,960
want to do I want to have the test

581
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:38,120
complain when one single pixel changes

582
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:41,660
one Hugh one shoe step it's very that's

583
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:43,780
a very very very easy answer to that

584
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:47,660
this rendering here is 800 x 600 pixel

585
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:50,300
if somebody asked me to underline the

586
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:53,300
last the last line this is 200 pixels

587
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:55,670
and max 200 pixels time one pixels is

588
00:24:55,670 --> 00:24:59,120
200 pixels square area 200 pixels in an

589
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:02,190
800 600 pixel image is nothing so even

590
00:25:02,190 --> 00:25:04,889
% so if I have an algorithm that kind of

591
00:25:04,889 --> 00:25:07,470
is fuzzy and most of the other tools are

592
00:25:07,470 --> 00:25:09,779
doing fuzzy compared comparison because

593
00:25:09,779 --> 00:25:12,570
you guys no anti-aliasing the pages look

594
00:25:12,570 --> 00:25:15,899
different all the time so I'm going that

595
00:25:15,899 --> 00:25:17,460
my personal pet peeve I'm going for a

596
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:19,919
pixel perfect comparisons and if there

597
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:21,090
are problems around that with flaky

598
00:25:21,090 --> 00:25:22,350
tests i'm going to find a different way

599
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:24,570
of solving that sorry did I answer your

600
00:25:24,570 --> 00:25:35,120
question so a question about Travis CI

601
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:37,500
the problem I haven't solved is the

602
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:39,299
command line and that's something that

603
00:25:39,299 --> 00:25:41,850
needs solving but that's the way I'm

604
00:25:41,850 --> 00:25:43,529
done you're doing it takes much more

605
00:25:43,529 --> 00:25:45,389
time phantom CSS and that's the benefit

606
00:25:45,389 --> 00:25:49,169
of that is I think you can do it added

607
00:25:49,169 --> 00:25:51,120
to Travis I haven't I'm talking to a guy

608
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,649
who's implementing phantom CSS on the

609
00:25:52,649 --> 00:25:54,649
project I have five minutes left i think

610
00:25:54,649 --> 00:25:57,860
the the problem with phantom CSS is

611
00:25:57,860 --> 00:26:01,679
again the snowflakes i tried it i have a

612
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:03,570
mac computer i tried to check a check in

613
00:26:03,570 --> 00:26:05,700
a build on a linux server yeah that

614
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:08,129
didn't work well there was a same

615
00:26:08,129 --> 00:26:10,320
browser same version but the browser's

616
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:13,919
depend on the rendering engine of the

617
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:17,850
system below so good question sadly no

618
00:26:17,850 --> 00:26:25,889
so far so phantoms CSS is using phantom

619
00:26:25,889 --> 00:26:28,440
if you want to know what I'm doing come

620
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:34,370
to my talk on Friday I I lost a year

621
00:26:34,370 --> 00:26:38,519
implementing that in the browser the

622
00:26:38,519 --> 00:26:40,500
browser is not very happy with you

623
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:42,960
rendering other pages inside the browser

624
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,940
but there is a way as you guys

625
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:50,220
interested I can go on forever thanks a

626
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:59,310
lot
