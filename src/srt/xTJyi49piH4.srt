hello everyone I'm fantastic and I am a

11
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:34,270
grifter I want to welcome you to

12
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:36,160
grifters Anonymous thank you for coming

13
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,260
to this meeting a surprising showing

14
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:42,579
actually so I'm happy to see that I know

15
00:00:42,579 --> 00:00:46,150
that there's a j/s meetup in town so

16
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:48,010
this is not that we're gonna talk about

17
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:50,230
stealing things from people who can

18
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:54,400
afford to lose them so my grifter story

19
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:58,510
starts in 2011 I was working at a small

20
00:00:58,510 --> 00:01:00,730
three-person company the three people

21
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:05,049
were my dad Doug and myself I was doing

22
00:01:05,049 --> 00:01:07,720
accounting business management type

23
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:11,770
stuff and I was right around the kind of

24
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:14,170
crash of the American economy

25
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:19,049
and our business was going down and I

26
00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:22,659
thought well you know for sure I'm gonna

27
00:01:22,659 --> 00:01:23,860
have a problem I'm gonna have to find a

28
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:27,369
new job but surely I won't go out get

29
00:01:27,369 --> 00:01:30,520
laid off before Doug right to my

30
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:33,549
surprise and disappointment I did and if

31
00:01:33,549 --> 00:01:34,869
you've never been laid off by your

32
00:01:34,869 --> 00:01:39,670
father before Doug it's an emotionally

33
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:45,280
distressing experience so um it was

34
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,750
followed by another emotionally stressed

35
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:49,960
Express another emotional experience was

36
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:52,090
I found out that I had spent all this

37
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:54,460
time working on my my dad's company and

38
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:57,250
I was at this point unemployable

39
00:01:57,250 --> 00:02:01,119
effectively I had some good business

40
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:03,400
experience but not a lot of great

41
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,650
business experience and this was at a

42
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:08,200
time where people with master's degrees

43
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:10,420
and finances were getting kind of

44
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:12,400
swooped up for like a quarter on the

45
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,760
dollar in terms of salary so this was a

46
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,670
this was a bad time for me I had been on

47
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:22,780
unemployment for about six months and I

48
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:24,459
started to think seriously about what

49
00:02:24,459 --> 00:02:24,910
else

50
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:28,930
I might be able to do and so got a new

51
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:32,890
slide up so this was all the time that I

52
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:35,320
had heard that anyone can code as the

53
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:39,370
rat says here and I thought well maybe

54
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:41,860
maybe I could maybe it could I had a

55
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:44,950
very bad experience with code in middle

56
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:48,010
school I took one computer science class

57
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:51,460
where we learned like C++ and Java

58
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:54,310
I say learned they learned stuff I

59
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:56,470
cheated the whole time

60
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:59,380
I just took I just bribed my fellow

61
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:01,630
students and I took their Tower of Hanoi

62
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:03,910
problems and then just kind of renamed

63
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:06,040
the variables and submitted them as my

64
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:09,010
own but it all came to a head when our

65
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:11,400
final project was this blackjack app and

66
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:14,830
I had an C I had created it in such way

67
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:17,050
where I didn't implement any logic in

68
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:20,260
terms of hitting or standing I just

69
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:22,450
looked at the users hand and decided

70
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:24,220
whether or not I was going to hit or

71
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:26,760
stand based on how close they were to 21

72
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:30,100
my teacher did not find this interesting

73
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:33,250
or amusing it at least and I said you

74
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:36,790
know I'm a pragmatist so I can I do so

75
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:38,290
good question real quick question for

76
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:42,070
you who has lied on a resume now I want

77
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:43,360
you to be super honest I want you to

78
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,890
kind of like think for a little bit like

79
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:47,350
no one hopefully no one who hired you is

80
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:51,220
here so who has lied at some point on a

81
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:55,720
resume okay that's not enough hands I

82
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:58,080
think some of you were lying right now

83
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,020
I'm gonna define lying a little bit I'm

84
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:02,920
putting something on your resume that

85
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:05,130
you have not actually like gotten paid

86
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:10,630
to to do so like if I put Oh camel on my

87
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:13,239
resume I I might be inclined to because

88
00:04:13,239 --> 00:04:14,590
I'm played with it but like I haven't

89
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:16,570
gotten like paid to do it my resume is

90
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:21,190
full of that so I want to tell you

91
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:23,260
a little bit about a little story about

92
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:25,140
how I kind of like came into programming

93
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:27,730
this is gonna be a lot of stories very

94
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:31,419
shy on the code so um I hope not to

95
00:04:31,419 --> 00:04:35,080
disappoint you when so I was coming off

96
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,700
the six months of unemployment and I was

97
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:37,539
desperate

98
00:04:37,539 --> 00:04:38,409
I had

99
00:04:38,409 --> 00:04:40,989
I had just been married so I'd been

100
00:04:40,989 --> 00:04:42,459
married for a little bit but I had a

101
00:04:42,459 --> 00:04:45,099
wife at a mortgage I had a brand-new kid

102
00:04:45,099 --> 00:04:47,019
and I was like freaking the hell out

103
00:04:47,019 --> 00:04:50,830
like what am I gonna do and so I thought

104
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:52,149
okay so I'm gonna try to figure out this

105
00:04:52,149 --> 00:04:54,849
code thing and I've been working from

106
00:04:54,849 --> 00:04:56,289
time to time to try to learn some new

107
00:04:56,289 --> 00:04:58,569
things and then I went for my first kind

108
00:04:58,569 --> 00:05:00,699
of like big pants job where I was gonna

109
00:05:00,699 --> 00:05:02,979
go get paid a salary to work as a

110
00:05:02,979 --> 00:05:06,729
developer it was kind of entry-level so

111
00:05:06,729 --> 00:05:09,279
is HTML CSS and this proprietary

112
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:10,959
language they were gonna teach me so

113
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:13,089
this is perfect it's perfect for me and

114
00:05:13,089 --> 00:05:16,360
I went for it with a friend of mine who

115
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,669
happened to me I'm better qualified than

116
00:05:18,669 --> 00:05:19,629
me

117
00:05:19,629 --> 00:05:21,879
had more experience than me better

118
00:05:21,879 --> 00:05:24,550
experience there were a couple rules so

119
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:25,959
I thought well maybe we'll both get it

120
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:27,969
he'll definitely get it but I'll maybe

121
00:05:27,969 --> 00:05:32,619
I'll get it too he didn't get it and we

122
00:05:32,619 --> 00:05:33,999
started to kind of like process us

123
00:05:33,999 --> 00:05:36,669
through I was like what like why like

124
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:39,669
why is it that I got this and you didn't

125
00:05:39,669 --> 00:05:41,019
and so we started talking about this and

126
00:05:41,019 --> 00:05:44,019
it came down to came down to a t-shirt I

127
00:05:44,019 --> 00:05:47,139
said okay so so what did you wear to

128
00:05:47,139 --> 00:05:48,219
this interview how do you how do you

129
00:05:48,219 --> 00:05:49,509
like prepare would you prepare because

130
00:05:49,509 --> 00:05:50,829
I'd been like going to meetups trying to

131
00:05:50,829 --> 00:05:52,419
figure out like how nerds talk and stuff

132
00:05:52,419 --> 00:05:55,929
like that and and and he's like well you

133
00:05:55,929 --> 00:05:58,539
know like I I shaved my shaved my beard

134
00:05:58,539 --> 00:06:01,779
I got a nice haircut and I wore a suit I

135
00:06:01,779 --> 00:06:03,990
was like oh no dude you did it all wrong

136
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:06,339
it was like I went into that meeting not

137
00:06:06,339 --> 00:06:07,149
knowing

138
00:06:07,149 --> 00:06:09,249
but like I just wore converse jeans and

139
00:06:09,249 --> 00:06:12,489
a t-shirt and like I I named that

140
00:06:12,489 --> 00:06:17,769
culture fit and this became like a cheat

141
00:06:17,769 --> 00:06:20,829
code for me I realized that so much of

142
00:06:20,829 --> 00:06:23,979
like being hireable in tech right now is

143
00:06:23,979 --> 00:06:29,439
like looking and fitting the part now

144
00:06:29,439 --> 00:06:32,379
this kind of like came came came to bite

145
00:06:32,379 --> 00:06:34,209
me but one of the things that I learned

146
00:06:34,209 --> 00:06:37,509
early on is that the kind of main export

147
00:06:37,509 --> 00:06:41,919
of a tech nerd is pedantry you just have

148
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:44,199
to give a about something that

149
00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:48,459
nobody else cares about so like tabs

150
00:06:48,459 --> 00:06:51,279
versus spaces right like it doesn't

151
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:52,090
matter

152
00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:55,480
at all um but it's something that we

153
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,370
care deeply about we want to like make

154
00:06:57,370 --> 00:06:59,560
sure that like our underdog opinion is

155
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,900
like validated even though both seem to

156
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:04,169
be the underdog opinion

157
00:07:04,169 --> 00:07:07,540
now as I invested in my kind of sense of

158
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:10,060
pedantry I kind of made I made one

159
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:15,250
little misstep I my wife it was her

160
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:17,230
birthday and it was like kind of like a

161
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:18,910
week of and she's telling me like you

162
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:21,610
know I want to do is it's like have

163
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:23,050
Girl's Day and we're gonna like you can

164
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:25,120
move the TV you know put it on this like

165
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:28,000
you know vanity well watch Gilmore Girls

166
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,690
all day and there was like it's like

167
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:32,650
like I knew that I had kind of like

168
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:33,850
leveled up because there was this like

169
00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:36,100
block right here and like this this

170
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:38,470
request very like a simple honest great

171
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:40,810
request I came in and I just deflected

172
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:44,800
it I saw it fall to the ground I said I

173
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,550
said you know the structural integrity

174
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:50,500
of that vanity seems really questionable

175
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:53,139
there's no way it's gonna hold our 60

176
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:56,919
pound TV she like this rage started to

177
00:07:56,919 --> 00:07:58,720
like just come up in here she's like get

178
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,060
out of my house like I did not marry one

179
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:04,960
of those Big Bang Theory nerds and so

180
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,729
what part of me was like oh man like I'm

181
00:08:06,729 --> 00:08:08,620
super sad I disappointed my wife well

182
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:16,000
then the other half is like yeah and so

183
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,890
then but I mean it gets worse because

184
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:19,960
then I'm like like well actually like

185
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,100
that's kind of a misconception because

186
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:23,050
like Big Bang Theory nerds you're like a

187
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:25,300
bad depiction of science nerds and I'm

188
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:27,850
more like a HBO Silicon Valley a nerd so

189
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:32,409
does that change how you feel at all it

190
00:08:32,409 --> 00:08:36,940
did not so what I've learned from my

191
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:38,770
experience over the years is the more is

192
00:08:38,770 --> 00:08:42,820
caught than taught and bad habits spread

193
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:46,300
pretty quickly and I learned this as I

194
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:48,520
was kind of making that transition into

195
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:52,540
being a more senior engineer and really

196
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:54,160
what that comes down to is like now

197
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,990
instead of like kind of just having like

198
00:08:55,990 --> 00:08:58,089
a bunch of opinions about and being able

199
00:08:58,089 --> 00:09:00,910
to do like base level tasks kind of like

200
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:02,560
think more globally about your

201
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,180
applications and the products that

202
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:06,399
you're working on

203
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:09,620
and it came to a head as I was watching

204
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:13,490
Netflix's chef's table episode of Dan

205
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:17,390
barber know this man is an amazing chef

206
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,670
absolutely incredible and he's really

207
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:21,560
more of like a food philosopher than

208
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:23,660
anything else I definitely definitely

209
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:26,570
recommend watching this episode he's

210
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:29,300
very like soft-spoken thoughtful poetic

211
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:32,329
about his his work he's doing amazing

212
00:09:32,329 --> 00:09:34,730
things he has his own farm and they're

213
00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:37,010
really investing in like kind of how we

214
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:42,290
think and work with food now he's really

215
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:43,670
amazing you're watching the first like

216
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:45,320
maybe 10 minutes of this episode you're

217
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,029
thinking wow what an incredible person

218
00:09:47,029 --> 00:09:49,209
like I thought all chefs were assholes

219
00:09:49,209 --> 00:09:52,010
and then they show footage of him in the

220
00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:54,320
kitchen and he like every other chef is

221
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:58,279
a monster just like I mean just one of

222
00:09:58,279 --> 00:09:59,930
the worst that I've ever seen just a

223
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:01,779
total train wreck in the kitchen

224
00:10:01,779 --> 00:10:04,700
so as good documentarians they asked him

225
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:06,230
they say you know we're talking to this

226
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:09,230
guy and he's super like sweet thoughtful

227
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:12,020
nice poetic and then on the other hand

228
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:13,430
like we see you in the kitchen and you

229
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:17,270
were just a beast I need he kind of sits

230
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:19,970
back thoughtfully for a second and says

231
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:22,520
you know the way I'm in the kitchen is

232
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:27,110
abhorrent but that's how I learned you

233
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:28,579
know from the people who mentored me and

234
00:10:28,579 --> 00:10:30,170
that's how they learned from the people

235
00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:32,899
that mentored them and I don't know how

236
00:10:32,899 --> 00:10:35,959
to do any different and I was just I was

237
00:10:35,959 --> 00:10:37,910
just weeping as I was watching this

238
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:42,130
because I was like it me it me I feel it

239
00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:46,610
and I think that's so often in this

240
00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:49,970
industry we front with certainty we want

241
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:52,430
to feel smart and to feel like we know

242
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:55,190
the answers and to be certain about the

243
00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:57,589
things that are ahead of us this is how

244
00:10:57,589 --> 00:10:59,570
we nail job interviews this is how we

245
00:10:59,570 --> 00:11:01,490
you know continue to progress in our

246
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:06,589
career etc and we use this certainty as

247
00:11:06,589 --> 00:11:09,199
a cheat code we love to find like best

248
00:11:09,199 --> 00:11:11,149
practices and patterns that we can use

249
00:11:11,149 --> 00:11:14,270
and apply this allows us to like feel

250
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:17,470
really smart in a lot of situations

251
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:19,250
unfortunately in my

252
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:22,190
case and meant that skill was outpacing

253
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:24,230
experience I had a lot of opinions on

254
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:26,950
things that I had not actually earned

255
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:30,640
experience in and this is problematic

256
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,410
now I'm about to offend maybe half of

257
00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:36,680
you this is a lot like religion my early

258
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:38,930
religious experiences were were such

259
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:41,690
that I grew up Baptist and there was

260
00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:44,540
such that everything was a sin or on the

261
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:46,490
front steps of a sin and the only way

262
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:47,900
that you could make it to heaven was to

263
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:49,760
never even get close to anything that

264
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:52,820
kind of looked like a sin but if you if

265
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:55,010
you were successful in that then like it

266
00:11:55,010 --> 00:11:56,810
was like guarantee you were like you

267
00:11:56,810 --> 00:12:00,120
were gonna go no problem

268
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:02,270
now I'm gonna offend the other half of

269
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:06,980
you um I think that all of us in this

270
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:09,080
tech field are religious about something

271
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:12,260
so maybe you were atheist agnostic not

272
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:14,810
not religious at all I think that we as

273
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:18,170
a culture have very strong and religious

274
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:20,960
opinions about the way that we develop a

275
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:24,110
code the way that we write it and the

276
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:25,700
way that we treat people when they don't

277
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:27,260
write it the way that we think it should

278
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:30,470
be written and lately we've been

279
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:32,480
starting to teach this to our robots

280
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,880
so now you can have blazing fast

281
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,339
religious criticism right into your

282
00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:42,710
editor and as religious organizations

283
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:44,510
we're always on the hunt for a villain

284
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:46,370
we always want to find the bad thing

285
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:48,230
that's kind of caught the source of all

286
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:52,280
of our problems and never is it internal

287
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,930
we never look inside we say that it's

288
00:12:53,930 --> 00:12:56,120
the customer the p.m. the owner of the

289
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:59,089
company the stakeholders we always want

290
00:12:59,089 --> 00:13:01,010
to look externally that they're the

291
00:13:01,010 --> 00:13:02,660
problem all of these unpredictable

292
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:05,839
sources of change that's what that's the

293
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:07,670
problem with our app if we could just be

294
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:09,830
certain and know exactly how we're

295
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:12,290
moving forward then everything would be

296
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:12,770
great

297
00:13:12,770 --> 00:13:17,510
that's not how applications work so I

298
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:20,900
want to tell you right now it's okay to

299
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:23,450
be uncertain whatever level of

300
00:13:23,450 --> 00:13:25,910
experience you're at it's okay to be

301
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:26,920
uncertain

302
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:30,080
honestly the greatest leaps in my career

303
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,100
have been

304
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:34,070
when I walked into uncertainty not

305
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:35,449
knowing what the answer was going to be

306
00:13:35,449 --> 00:13:37,310
and kind of figured it out as I went

307
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:41,870
along there are no Universal rules so I

308
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:43,550
want to illustrate this it might be kind

309
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:45,980
of hard to see so so I'll illustrate it

310
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:49,759
verbally as well so this is who's who's

311
00:13:49,759 --> 00:13:51,170
heard about dry code don't repeat

312
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:53,779
yourself yeah okay I'm gonna suing

313
00:13:53,779 --> 00:13:55,250
everyone most of the hands went up but I

314
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:57,500
think most of you have heard about it so

315
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:00,800
um dry stands for don't repeat yourself

316
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,600
and this is one of the kind of first

317
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:05,540
tenets of clean great code that you

318
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:08,209
learn early on now we had a mentor come

319
00:14:08,209 --> 00:14:09,829
into our company and start to talk with

320
00:14:09,829 --> 00:14:11,600
us about how to make like really

321
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,329
adaptable agile code and this is

322
00:14:14,329 --> 00:14:15,680
something that she said over and over

323
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,720
again as we presented some of our

324
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:20,600
solutions to theoretical problems that

325
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:23,199
were like just perfectly well abstracted

326
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:26,060
she would say that code looks so dry

327
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:30,170
that it chafes now if you're like a

328
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:32,480
runner or a cyclist like you know about

329
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:36,529
chafing it's not fun um and so I wanted

330
00:14:36,529 --> 00:14:37,639
to kind of like illustrate this with

331
00:14:37,639 --> 00:14:40,819
play-doh so here I have some brand new

332
00:14:40,819 --> 00:14:42,740
out of the container of play-doh and

333
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:45,110
it's like very pliable it's very like it

334
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:46,850
doesn't put up a lot of fight when I try

335
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:49,490
to change its shape I can make this be

336
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:52,639
whatever I need it to be now on this

337
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:54,470
side I have some dry play-doh

338
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:56,750
now unfortunately play-doh has gotten

339
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:58,850
really good and I thought two days out

340
00:14:58,850 --> 00:15:01,579
would make it very dry but it only kind

341
00:15:01,579 --> 00:15:05,449
of made it kind of dry so um hopefully

342
00:15:05,449 --> 00:15:08,600
this will be enough um as I so this

343
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,459
resists me so as I try to like squish it

344
00:15:10,459 --> 00:15:14,120
it resists and if I really try to push

345
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:16,310
it you can see like cracks start to form

346
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:18,380
this is really it's it's very resistant

347
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:19,730
to the change that I'm trying to apply

348
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:21,889
to it so it kind of wants to stay in

349
00:15:21,889 --> 00:15:25,790
this shape you can see you wanted to say

350
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:27,889
that does the purpose of design is to

351
00:15:27,889 --> 00:15:29,930
allow you to do design later and its

352
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:32,120
primary goal is to reduce the cost of

353
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:38,230
change and in that sense dry is dead

354
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:40,639
something that's been dried out we

355
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:42,319
oftentimes have the experience of having

356
00:15:42,319 --> 00:15:44,520
to rehydrate it in order to make it

357
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:46,470
in order to change it to make the thing

358
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:48,630
that it now needs to be when we get new

359
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:51,570
constraints and inevitably we will get

360
00:15:51,570 --> 00:15:53,280
new constraints this is the way that

361
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:54,960
that software works this is how our

362
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:58,800
businesses and applications grow and

363
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:02,280
there's a context for all of these rules

364
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:06,030
these strong tenets of code and they can

365
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:07,890
be more or less divided into two

366
00:16:07,890 --> 00:16:09,300
categories things that we know and

367
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:11,070
things that we don't know things that we

368
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:13,410
know become naturally stable and things

369
00:16:13,410 --> 00:16:15,240
that we don't know need to remain

370
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:19,170
pliable for as long as possible where we

371
00:16:19,170 --> 00:16:20,940
get into trouble is when we try to like

372
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:23,730
take rules from one side and use them on

373
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:26,760
the other so an example is dry write dry

374
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:29,190
is great in some cases we want a hat

375
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:32,580
like you can't build a castle I guess

376
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:34,410
you can't build a castle out of play-doh

377
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:36,060
right you need stones you need hardened

378
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:39,240
stones that's good when we move that to

379
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,740
things that need to change things that

380
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:42,810
were uncertain about well that becomes

381
00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:45,300
really that becomes bad it becomes hard

382
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:46,980
to change those things if they're dried

383
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:49,110
out another thing is readability

384
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:51,720
readability is awesome on things that

385
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:54,420
we're uncertain about and need to change

386
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:57,230
regularly but it can become a liability

387
00:16:57,230 --> 00:17:00,000
in in parts of our code that are

388
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,070
hardened and I say that because while

389
00:17:02,070 --> 00:17:04,140
readability is always good sometimes it

390
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:06,660
does take a second third or fourth seed

391
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:10,650
to things like performance and when you

392
00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:13,950
try to like re readable performant code

393
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:20,010
you actually make it worse so in that I

394
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:22,140
believe that components are our

395
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:25,290
architecture now you can sub that for

396
00:17:25,290 --> 00:17:26,670
modules if you're not a front-end

397
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:28,440
developer however most of my experiences

398
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:32,670
in the front-end space modules are

399
00:17:32,670 --> 00:17:34,110
really fascinating we have these a lot

400
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:36,480
in in music and music provides a

401
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:39,270
beautiful illustration for this in a lot

402
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:41,340
of musical systems like a modular system

403
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:44,850
in music production you have a lot of

404
00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:47,790
black boxes and these black boxes are

405
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:50,390
composed together to get a new sound

406
00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:53,520
each of these boxes the implementation

407
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,320
is hidden from you and you have just an

408
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:57,360
interface to kind of control the you

409
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:57,620
know

410
00:17:57,620 --> 00:18:02,900
the parameters of that and these modules

411
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:05,570
can come from very disparate places they

412
00:18:05,570 --> 00:18:06,890
can come from different manufacturers

413
00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:08,900
that can have very different things but

414
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:10,039
as long as they have a single

415
00:18:10,039 --> 00:18:12,830
responsibility and they have a common

416
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:14,150
interface well they can all work

417
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:17,980
together to create a new sound and if

418
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:20,210
something burns up or you decide that

419
00:18:20,210 --> 00:18:21,500
you don't like this part of your sound

420
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,460
you don't have to replace the whole

421
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:24,470
thing you can just pop out the part that

422
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:25,549
doesn't work and replace it with

423
00:18:25,549 --> 00:18:28,610
something else you love Mikey no

424
00:18:28,610 --> 00:18:30,380
Photoshop there it's so photorealistic

425
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:34,279
what I've done and so what I want in my

426
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:36,559
code is not so much that it's clean but

427
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:38,960
that it has well-defined interfaces that

428
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,850
everything can be hot swappable I have

429
00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:43,490
these hot swappable black boxes that I

430
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:48,289
can compose in neat ways and once we

431
00:18:48,289 --> 00:18:50,240
have that clean code really just becomes

432
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,950
fashion a lot of these rules that we

433
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:54,260
have for like where semicolons should be

434
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:57,010
and spaces should be and like how many

435
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:59,120
variables should be defined on which

436
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:01,370
lines and all that stuff becomes really

437
00:19:01,370 --> 00:19:04,279
less important when you think about code

438
00:19:04,279 --> 00:19:07,340
like this in terms of interfaces so I

439
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:09,710
want to present to you four tenets or

440
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:13,940
things to think about to make code like

441
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:16,840
this and I call this hot garbage

442
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:20,330
architecture so the first thing is the

443
00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:21,679
code should be pliable one of the things

444
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:25,190
that I see more often than not is this

445
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:27,919
this idea of speculative generality so

446
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:29,570
you you know that you need to make a

447
00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:32,090
modal and so you go in you're like modal

448
00:19:32,090 --> 00:19:34,850
Jas right like you just claimed the

449
00:19:34,850 --> 00:19:37,039
namespace this is gonna be the modal for

450
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:39,110
now and forever everything is gonna use

451
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:42,230
this thing and we're always wrong every

452
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:44,659
time maybe you kind of got it a little

453
00:19:44,659 --> 00:19:47,000
bit right but like it's it's never

454
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,789
perfectly right it's like hole-in-one

455
00:19:49,789 --> 00:19:52,100
odds right yeah we're gonna be playing

456
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:55,850
golf tomorrow or some of us are and it'd

457
00:19:55,850 --> 00:19:57,679
be like trying to optimize your golf

458
00:19:57,679 --> 00:19:59,480
game around getting hole-in-ones well

459
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,890
you can just be on the field the

460
00:20:00,890 --> 00:20:02,149
rest of the time but as long as you get

461
00:20:02,149 --> 00:20:03,799
a number of hole-in-ones right like

462
00:20:03,799 --> 00:20:05,870
you're really crushing it it's not how

463
00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:10,700
golf works and I see this a lot I try

464
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:11,420
not to pick on like

465
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:13,040
specific libraries but this is one that

466
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:16,730
look really kind of hurts hurts code

467
00:20:16,730 --> 00:20:19,820
regularly that I've seen and this is

468
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:22,430
some so yes lint plugin react if you're

469
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:24,110
a reactant developer there's a whole

470
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:25,790
bunch of kind of pedantic rules that

471
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:28,730
don't seem to kind of be based out of

472
00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:31,250
kind of a philosophy about code really

473
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:33,230
but just the fact that there is a

474
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:35,780
natural state and so maybe we should

475
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:38,870
define a kind of like a stricter state I

476
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:39,380
guess

477
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:41,270
so one of these is like one component

478
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:44,780
per file and that just ops you out of

479
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:47,750
modules altogether which seems crazy and

480
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:50,290
so the second thing the second tenant is

481
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:54,950
composability this is what my favorite

482
00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:59,120
Lego sets ever I think it used to be

483
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,700
like $5.00 and now it's like 35 if you

484
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:03,890
were to try to find it on the black

485
00:21:03,890 --> 00:21:04,490
market

486
00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:09,140
whoops Lego so my favorite thing about

487
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:11,000
this is that it's an honest-to-goodness

488
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,950
three in one set you don't have like a

489
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:14,540
lot of pieces left over it's like when

490
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:16,580
you tear it down and you make the new

491
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:18,670
thing it like all the pieces are used

492
00:21:18,670 --> 00:21:23,420
absolutely incredible and I wanted to

493
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:26,000
bring it today but I asked my son if he

494
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,680
could give it to me and he said you

495
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,270
won't dad I'm actually experimenting

496
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:32,810
with a mono repo structure for my Lego

497
00:21:32,810 --> 00:21:38,090
so I'm not sure I could find it but it's

498
00:21:38,090 --> 00:21:42,560
blazing fast dad you know at least he

499
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:47,390
knows how to sell it so I see this in

500
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:49,730
react components a lot where we have a

501
00:21:49,730 --> 00:21:51,740
lot of we have one component and it's

502
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:53,360
like oh cool like this is this is our

503
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,940
accordion this is accordion j/s we're

504
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:58,070
gonna use it everywhere but over time

505
00:21:58,070 --> 00:22:01,280
you start to add a ton of like a ton of

506
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,320
properties for these things for very

507
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:08,360
disparate situations and each one of

508
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:10,880
these properties is it can is a

509
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:15,410
configuration now I'm not going to go

510
00:22:15,410 --> 00:22:17,420
into it but the code that I prefer to

511
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:19,310
see is when we use components over

512
00:22:19,310 --> 00:22:21,770
configuration we're instead of having a

513
00:22:21,770 --> 00:22:24,080
lot of configuration a lot of props that

514
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,130
we pass down for all

515
00:22:25,130 --> 00:22:27,470
these disparate situations we actually

516
00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:31,370
expose like this on this Lego box tools

517
00:22:31,370 --> 00:22:33,940
for creating multiple different things

518
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:36,800
so instead of instead of configuring

519
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,930
this one thing we say here are all the

520
00:22:38,930 --> 00:22:40,820
parts you do whatever you want with it

521
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:44,440
it's gonna work and use your imagination

522
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:47,780
if you're not a react developer you're

523
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:49,400
going to give this as functions over

524
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:52,250
configuration though it doesn't have to

525
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:54,580
cease so it's less cool

526
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:57,970
the third tenet is I'm a reasonableness

527
00:22:57,970 --> 00:23:00,080
my little marker on the bottom didn't

528
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,550
move that's sad but we're we're an

529
00:23:01,550 --> 00:23:04,870
umbrella Tora Terry territory right now

530
00:23:04,870 --> 00:23:08,120
so this umbrella is very reasonable it's

531
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:11,950
raining outside this umbrella is

532
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:14,530
unreasonable it's not raining outside

533
00:23:14,530 --> 00:23:17,600
this one's realistic and this one is

534
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:22,010
speculative this is where it starts to

535
00:23:22,010 --> 00:23:22,670
hurt

536
00:23:22,670 --> 00:23:26,090
timely perf optimization is reasonable

537
00:23:26,090 --> 00:23:31,970
and perf always is not reasonable so

538
00:23:31,970 --> 00:23:34,280
when I teach I get this a lot I show

539
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:35,720
people how to make a click counter and

540
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:37,940
react and then I write it like this I

541
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:39,740
use an anonymous function I write set

542
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:41,540
state in line and then I just do it like

543
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:44,060
do it all right there and people who

544
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:46,250
have not actually learned enough react

545
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:48,770
to make anything say isn't this not

546
00:23:48,770 --> 00:23:53,330
performant and I say well sure if you

547
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:56,840
were to make a UI like this but that

548
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:58,070
seems terrible and it's not going to

549
00:23:58,070 --> 00:24:01,970
make you any money so one thing for this

550
00:24:01,970 --> 00:24:04,040
is I say love your manager I know that a

551
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,300
lot of times we have a very tenuous

552
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:07,430
relationship with our managers and it

553
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:10,160
sucks like I get it they want they want

554
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,990
something for the customer and we just

555
00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:14,540
want to like make sure that the code is

556
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:17,120
perfect and so they're always harsh

557
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:21,320
inner mellow I get it but managers like

558
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:23,540
see the North Star like money is always

559
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:26,540
in the North Star we need to make money

560
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:28,280
to keep doing our job the company needs

561
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:30,290
to like if we stop making money well

562
00:24:30,290 --> 00:24:32,060
like the whole thing kind of starts to

563
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:34,340
collapse and also I'm gonna be honest

564
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:36,440
they know something about us too they

565
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:38,540
know that code rage is immutable

566
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:40,670
you were always gonna hate the code

567
00:24:40,670 --> 00:24:42,920
that's on your screen weather like it's

568
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,780
written by the last idiot that touched

569
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:47,030
it or you wrote it half an hour ago

570
00:24:47,030 --> 00:24:50,750
you're gonna hate it and the only real

571
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:52,340
like kind of objective tool that you can

572
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:54,110
use for like measuring like whether or

573
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:56,900
not something should be changed is

574
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:59,480
churned versus complexity

575
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:01,310
so this graph kind of illustrates that a

576
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:02,840
little bit you can google it find all

577
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:04,940
kinds of articles on it but basically if

578
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:07,130
you have low complexity or what is it

579
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:09,320
high complexity and low churn don't

580
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:11,780
touch it if you have low complexity and

581
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:14,030
high churn like don't touch it you want

582
00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:15,320
to look for the outliers where you have

583
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:17,330
high complexity and high churn because

584
00:25:17,330 --> 00:25:21,500
that is regularly costing you money so

585
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:25,250
finally the fourth or I'm not sure why

586
00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:26,270
this is up there

587
00:25:26,270 --> 00:25:28,420
I made these slides but now I'm confused

588
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:34,130
is disposability so a friend of mine

589
00:25:34,130 --> 00:25:35,810
early on the first person who actually

590
00:25:35,810 --> 00:25:37,070
believed that I could be a programmer

591
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:39,680
kind of told me this and it stuck with

592
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:42,500
me ever since he says we add code ask

593
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:45,980
yourself how easily it will how easily

594
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:48,050
it would be removed when you realize you

595
00:25:48,050 --> 00:25:50,960
were wrong and you want to be able to

596
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:54,050
take that stuff out Oh without a trace

597
00:25:54,050 --> 00:26:00,410
stupid stupid so these are the these are

598
00:26:00,410 --> 00:26:02,360
the four kind of things to look out for

599
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:04,930
when you are kind of writing

600
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:08,540
architecting your code so what can I

601
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:10,040
tell you I can tell you from personal

602
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:11,450
experience I've been writing code like

603
00:26:11,450 --> 00:26:13,400
this for about a year and I've become a

604
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,650
much happier person I've become way less

605
00:26:15,650 --> 00:26:18,470
of a monster in the kitchen I've become

606
00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:21,080
way less pedantic and pull requests way

607
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:23,420
more accepting of code that like doesn't

608
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:26,450
really fit my personal aesthetic and

609
00:26:26,450 --> 00:26:28,550
it's made all of us more productive it's

610
00:26:28,550 --> 00:26:32,270
given me a kind of a comfortable space

611
00:26:32,270 --> 00:26:34,370
to be able to hear other people's input

612
00:26:34,370 --> 00:26:36,860
and I've learned so much from other

613
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:38,870
people that I would have not I would

614
00:26:38,870 --> 00:26:40,700
have never learned if I just shut them

615
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:42,370
out immediately on some type of

616
00:26:42,370 --> 00:26:46,370
religious ideal but don't listen don't

617
00:26:46,370 --> 00:26:48,620
listen to me like don't like listen to

618
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:52,040
Kent Beck Kent Beck is an amazing

619
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:52,530
program

620
00:26:52,530 --> 00:26:53,850
he's been doing this thing for a long

621
00:26:53,850 --> 00:26:56,610
time he is the creator of extreme

622
00:26:56,610 --> 00:26:59,130
programming where he does things tests

623
00:26:59,130 --> 00:27:01,650
first where he defines the interface and

624
00:27:01,650 --> 00:27:04,350
then writes the code and he went on to

625
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:07,140
be some c-level engineer at a company

626
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:09,330
whose motto is move fast and break

627
00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:11,690
things

628
00:27:11,690 --> 00:27:14,730
so mute the thought leaders remember

629
00:27:14,730 --> 00:27:16,950
that the product is just a function of

630
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:20,520
the special specification hey and we are

631
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:22,560
that function and sometimes that means

632
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:24,630
that we're just shoveling code from

633
00:27:24,630 --> 00:27:27,050
one place to another until it all works

634
00:27:27,050 --> 00:27:32,580
but green code is green code thank you

635
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:34,260
so much for coming out to this grifters

636
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:35,880
Anonymous meeting I really appreciate

637
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:39,840
your time I've been thinking about how

638
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:42,480
to work in this industry for the next 10

639
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:46,490
20 30 years happily I realized that

640
00:27:46,490 --> 00:27:50,400
maybe our ideas of being a builder are

641
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:53,640
starting to fail us just a little bit we

642
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:54,750
have these ideas that we were like

643
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:56,700
engineers developers architects so we

644
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:58,800
use frameworks and scaffolding the idea

645
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:00,360
of being a builder and these

646
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:02,250
construction analogies have really

647
00:28:02,250 --> 00:28:05,790
deeply integrated with code work and I

648
00:28:05,790 --> 00:28:07,500
think that they're starting to fail a

649
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:09,690
little bit because we don't necessarily

650
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:12,330
build things that last 50 years a

651
00:28:12,330 --> 00:28:15,000
hundred years two hundred years it's

652
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,500
possible that when I get back from this

653
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:18,480
trip a specification on something that

654
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,130
I'm working on will have changed and I

655
00:28:20,130 --> 00:28:22,830
will have to rewrite the whole thing and

656
00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:24,900
that's not like the part of the job

657
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:28,470
that is the job I think that we're more

658
00:28:28,470 --> 00:28:32,970
like farmers we are farmers bump bump

659
00:28:32,970 --> 00:28:38,580
bump bump yeah and the reason is we work

660
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:40,950
on living things we don't take dead

661
00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:42,450
things and make more dead things out of

662
00:28:42,450 --> 00:28:44,250
them like a building we take living

663
00:28:44,250 --> 00:28:46,170
things and we try to make living things

664
00:28:46,170 --> 00:28:49,410
out of them and cultivation is a mess so

665
00:28:49,410 --> 00:28:52,910
who knows where the best fertilizer is

666
00:28:52,910 --> 00:28:54,870
 that's right

667
00:28:54,870 --> 00:28:57,490
that's right
 is the best fertilizer

668
00:28:57,490 --> 00:29:01,059
is the best fertilizer
I don't know why I had to put it twice I

669
00:29:01,059 --> 00:29:04,630
guess it's more accessible this way so

670
00:29:04,630 --> 00:29:06,010
to end my talk I wanted to be kind of

671
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:12,460
like this guy the extremely divisive so

672
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:15,580
I'm ending with a Bible verse and this

673
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:17,080
is my favorite bible verse when I have

674
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:18,400
to put something in a production now

675
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:20,710
really don't feel great about I attached

676
00:29:20,710 --> 00:29:22,240
to this little verse the reference to

677
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:25,300
this verse in with a pull request where

678
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:27,510
there are no oxen the stable is clean

679
00:29:27,510 --> 00:29:30,520
but abundant crops come by the strength

680
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:33,820
of the Ox now the Bible has a tendency

681
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:36,070
to put things a little bit politey um so

682
00:29:36,070 --> 00:29:38,110
let me break this down for you clean

683
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:39,280
code is dead code

684
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:43,860
there's where money is made get it
