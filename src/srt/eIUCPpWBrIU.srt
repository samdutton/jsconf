1
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:16,320

hello so like miles yesterday we has he

2
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:17,910
has a beginning slide to Center himself

3
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:20,250
I thought I would play a song to more

4
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:21,660
center you not me because this is

5
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:24,060
totally nerve-wracking to be playing in

6
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:26,820
front of people but but we'll see how

7
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:36,900
this goes what's the song about rainbows

8
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:58,590
by the way which is ties into this

9
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:06,070
oh man I messed up I'm just gonna stop

10
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:08,979
and I'll play a song later it might be

11
00:01:08,979 --> 00:01:11,649
better cuz I yeah that's okay that was

12
00:01:11,649 --> 00:01:18,580
scary okay so colors um I really like

13
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:21,250
colors um I hope all of you like colors

14
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:23,830
because you hear who uses hsl kind of

15
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:26,740
today a lot doing that okay love you

16
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:29,110
people cuz you're near and dear to my

17
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:32,560
heart who uses RGB a lot still okay

18
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,420
great love you people too because I can

19
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:38,289
impose my world view on you so hopefully

20
00:01:38,289 --> 00:01:40,300
by the end of this talk you will decide

21
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:43,990
because of my my glam I plenty of

22
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:46,990
evidence that you should be using hsl so

23
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:50,289
RGB was RGB it's red green and blue so

24
00:01:50,289 --> 00:01:52,659
these are this is an orange let's

25
00:01:52,659 --> 00:01:55,119
simplify this a little bit so this is

26
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:59,170
red so the problem here often is like

27
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:03,149
you have like a red and you want a lets

28
00:02:03,149 --> 00:02:06,000
you want a lighter version of that color

29
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,350
so when you're when you're just in red

30
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:10,390
green or blue it's pretty simple like

31
00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:13,390
100 here you add some to that and you

32
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:16,959
get a lighter red and that makes kind of

33
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:19,630
intuitive sense so same same math works

34
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:20,739
out pretty easily if you're dealing with

35
00:02:20,739 --> 00:02:23,590
pure green clear blue but you end up

36
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:26,440
getting into weird weird areas here when

37
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,760
like you're trying to do the same thing

38
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,579
with like this orange if you kind of

39
00:02:30,579 --> 00:02:32,170
apply that same into it is kind of like

40
00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:34,870
I'm just going to add some numbers to

41
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:38,109
this to this RGB triplet you end up like

42
00:02:38,109 --> 00:02:40,390
you get a lighter color but it's not

43
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:43,180
orange anymore to yellow now and so say

44
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:45,070
i don't know like this blue it was zero

45
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:47,320
i'm not going to add to zero i'm going

46
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,850
to leave it 0 doesn't really help you

47
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:51,820
you're still yellow and really what

48
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:53,470
you're trying to do is you want this

49
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:56,530
this here to go from this orange so this

50
00:02:56,530 --> 00:02:58,720
lighter orange but this doesn't make

51
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,160
sense anymore like you're adding her

52
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:02,799
like some red you're adding actually a

53
00:03:02,799 --> 00:03:04,690
lot of blue and you're not adding much

54
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:08,709
green so that that really to me doesn't

55
00:03:08,709 --> 00:03:10,600
make any sense and I don't think it

56
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,100
makes sense to humans

57
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:18,220
so what's going on here so RGB is if you

58
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:20,740
look at a monitor if you take like a big

59
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:23,590
magnifying glass to this monitor where

60
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:25,660
you go like stare up in that like that

61
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:26,860
projector up there and hopefully not go

62
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:29,080
blind then you're going to see like a

63
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:32,260
pixel is made up of four LEDs you get

64
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:34,180
like a red LED a green LED and a blue

65
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:35,500
LED and they're really close together

66
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,930
and they're really small and they turn

67
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:39,600
on and off at different like

68
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:44,110
brightnesses and so what they could be

69
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:47,860
off at zero or fully on at 255 and so a

70
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:49,300
different weight like a different

71
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:53,050
intensities and since they're so small

72
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:54,370
and far away from your eye your eye

73
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:56,560
kinds like doesn't perceive them anymore

74
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,060
and the light ends up adding together

75
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:00,190
and the light is really what's going on

76
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:01,840
and mixing together to kind of form a

77
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,100
different wavelengths when it hits your

78
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:07,240
eye so so yeah if you if you deal with

79
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:09,400
mixing lasers together all day long then

80
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:12,550
you should use our gb if not then i

81
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:13,750
would say that it's not cool anymore

82
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:16,239
it's not cooled and be memorizing RGB

83
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:20,770
hex triplets to impress your friends RGB

84
00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:22,810
is not like brewing your own small batch

85
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:24,790
coffee with a cordless screwdriver

86
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:27,310
microcontroller it's more like this guy

87
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:31,300
on his commute in San Francisco on his

88
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:32,980
bus doing a line of cocaine off his

89
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:37,630
iphone our CP is it's not so uncool

90
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:41,980
that's cool again it's not cool um I'm

91
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:43,030
actually wondering what like this guy

92
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:45,280
sneaking out here he's like oh that's

93
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,800
good behind me oh he must be using RGB

94
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:52,480
too ok so RGB is a color space or color

95
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:55,990
mode or color model which I learned

96
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:57,940
yesterday where other names for it so

97
00:04:57,940 --> 00:04:59,380
what is a color space sounds kind of

98
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:03,070
scary but not too scary it's like XYZ so

99
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:05,170
kind of like Cartesian coordinates if I

100
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:07,840
say that corner over the room 000 to get

101
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,360
to me you come like 100 feet along this

102
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,160
wall sorry about the imperial units I'm

103
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,430
a uninformed American like a meter to

104
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:16,990
this way and like two or three meters up

105
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:18,640
to my head and I can tell you where I am

106
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:22,060
in the room and so similarly to hear if

107
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:24,180
I kind of increased the red hear it

108
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:25,860
goes along this axis and because my red

109
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:27,810
if i increase the blue it kind of comes

110
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:29,789
off that that axis and it's kind of like

111
00:05:29,789 --> 00:05:32,370
a purple and I can kind of come up and I

112
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:35,100
can see like there's this nice salmon

113
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:37,800
color here and you can kind of see this

114
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,810
entire space of color and it's cool so

115
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:41,610
you can like reference it's a good way

116
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:43,289
to reference colors um you get all these

117
00:05:43,289 --> 00:05:45,030
Reds over here you get that graze up

118
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:47,130
through the middle and I saw a blue

119
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:51,030
corner but again to kind of go back to

120
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:53,280
the analogy of kind of or that example

121
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:56,070
of lightning a color I was like at this

122
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:57,690
orange and I really wanted to get like

123
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:01,440
over here kind of and what we were doing

124
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,490
is like we were kind of going up

125
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:06,900
straight this way so that direction and

126
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:09,360
that angle there like it it doesn't

127
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,759
really make sense and it's analogous to

128
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:13,349
like this position of where I am in the

129
00:06:13,349 --> 00:06:15,990
room I want to tell everybody like an

130
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:17,580
emergency to exit through that door over

131
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:18,810
there I'm not going to be like oh you

132
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:22,320
know like a hundred feet that way and on

133
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,729
the wall and if I'm telling you in

134
00:06:23,729 --> 00:06:25,349
relation to me I feel like these vector

135
00:06:25,349 --> 00:06:26,849
math and I give you a relative vector

136
00:06:26,849 --> 00:06:28,889
and that doesn't make any sense really

137
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:30,150
what I'm trying to say is like to my

138
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:31,760
right I'll hundred feet that way right

139
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:34,800
and so that's polar coordinates if you

140
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,080
remember from like I don't know sixth

141
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:39,599
seventh grade geometry which I remember

142
00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:41,720
learning and thinking like this is weird

143
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:44,490
but the one takeaway I remember from

144
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:46,409
polar coordinates is that if you kind of

145
00:06:46,409 --> 00:06:48,330
reframe your problem or kind of change

146
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:50,190
is a problem statement actually ends up

147
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:54,240
with sometimes simpler answers like this

148
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,789
where like I can say to my right and 100

149
00:06:56,789 --> 00:06:59,400
feet so that's kind of why I want you

150
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,650
here so I would say let's make our own

151
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:04,919
color space what do I want out of this

152
00:07:04,919 --> 00:07:06,509
color space is I want to be able to

153
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:08,669
communicate to another person somewhat

154
00:07:08,669 --> 00:07:10,650
intuitively like what color I'm talking

155
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:13,139
about and I want to make like performing

156
00:07:13,139 --> 00:07:16,380
tasks on those colors more intuitive for

157
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:17,610
so you can like reason about it from

158
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:21,840
first principles and so how would we do

159
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,180
that so let's for example if I won't

160
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:26,370
want to describe the color of Jake the

161
00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:28,680
dog here he's like a must so if I'm

162
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,240
gonna try to tell you the color of Jake

163
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,279
the dog out I wouldn't give you our GP

164
00:07:32,279 --> 00:07:33,779
triplet i would i would probably say you

165
00:07:33,779 --> 00:07:37,710
know he's like mustard yellow or to kind

166
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:37,830
of

167
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:39,090
break that down a little he's yellow

168
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:42,120
kind of like a muted yellow and kind of

169
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,650
darker especially compared to like this

170
00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:45,960
yellow in this rainbow back here so

171
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,970
let's break down kind of what I more

172
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:50,870
naturally did to describe that color

173
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:53,880
let's take that rainbow which I alluded

174
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,470
to at the very beginning with that badly

175
00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:58,470
played song and just put into an array

176
00:07:58,470 --> 00:08:00,330
of because we like to put things into

177
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:03,750
arrays of let's start with 12 colors so

178
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:05,310
I get the entire rainbow here this is

179
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:09,890
roy g biv so red orange yellow greens

180
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:14,340
some random cyan a blue maybe this is

181
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:15,930
indigo maybe this is violet who knows

182
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:19,380
and if I kind of just increase the

183
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:21,810
number of buckets here we get to a nice

184
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:24,600
little rainbow and as you notice like

185
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:27,480
these are kind of thirds so red is at

186
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:30,660
zero greens at a third blues at a third

187
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:33,750
and kinda you get back to read so I'm

188
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:36,750
just ignore ignore why I'm doing 360 but

189
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:38,760
i'm going to go 360 because it does make

190
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,110
dividing this in the Third's a little

191
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:42,090
easier this is 120 so greens at 120

192
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:44,760
blues at 240 and it kind of wraps around

193
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:48,360
at 360 back the red so that specifies a

194
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,910
color like on a rainbow great that's one

195
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:53,160
large step so how do I talk about kind

196
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:55,670
of like the color of the sky or like the

197
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:58,500
muted sea green so if I want to like

198
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:02,250
describe the nice mute like cast over or

199
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:05,280
overcast the blue outside for the sky I

200
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:09,390
need to talk about saturation so if I

201
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:12,030
pick a color on this rainbow like this

202
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:14,750
this nice little blue here pretty close

203
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:18,810
and then I want to like yeah on the

204
00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:20,520
scale of one to ten I'd say the sky is

205
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:22,500
somewhere around like a five today at

206
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,150
least earlier now it's actually a lot

207
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:27,060
brighter and again like to work with

208
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:28,380
more colors here let's just go up to a

209
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:33,270
hundred ok so now that gives us a lot of

210
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:35,130
vocabulary ready so it gives us again a

211
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:38,250
hue a color from the rainbow and then

212
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:41,580
kind of how colorful that is and at that

213
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:43,560
at the end of the spectrum spectrum at

214
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:44,910
zero it's like the lack total lack of

215
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:47,520
the color so gray so you'll be you'll

216
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,900
notice that you were missing black and

217
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:51,030
white here to kind of talk about black

218
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:51,779
and white

219
00:09:51,779 --> 00:09:53,670
I would kind of say it's kind of how

220
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:55,499
much light is falling on color how

221
00:09:55,499 --> 00:09:57,689
bright the room is in a sense so if we

222
00:09:57,689 --> 00:09:58,949
turned off all the lights in here it

223
00:09:58,949 --> 00:10:00,720
would be all black and we be in darkness

224
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,509
if we turn the lights way up to like

225
00:10:03,509 --> 00:10:05,370
crazy levels we'd all be blinded and we

226
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:08,999
just see white that's my story anyway so

227
00:10:08,999 --> 00:10:11,819
again same get the gate 1 i'm going with

228
00:10:11,819 --> 00:10:14,370
this so let's go to scale 100 0 to 100

229
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:16,439
at the total lack of light where

230
00:10:16,439 --> 00:10:19,680
darkness and at full-on lightness we're

231
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:22,019
all blind and we see white I'm at 50 is

232
00:10:22,019 --> 00:10:23,339
like that nice sweet spot where like you

233
00:10:23,339 --> 00:10:26,879
see all the colors in the room nicely ok

234
00:10:26,879 --> 00:10:31,319
let's put all together so that I just

235
00:10:31,319 --> 00:10:35,910
backed out hsl so hue saturation and

236
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:38,879
lightness that's why it just all stands

237
00:10:38,879 --> 00:10:42,209
for so again you can kind of see how

238
00:10:42,209 --> 00:10:44,220
everything ties like this is RGB down

239
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:47,279
here and this is hsl appear you can kind

240
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:49,769
of see how if I change like rotate

241
00:10:49,769 --> 00:10:51,449
through is Hughes how like the RGB

242
00:10:51,449 --> 00:10:53,279
values kind of move around a little bit

243
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:56,069
in a weird way goes through like some

244
00:10:56,069 --> 00:10:57,750
weird permutations if I pick a color

245
00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:01,139
here and like a brightness here and I

246
00:11:01,139 --> 00:11:02,309
kind of so if I go to like full

247
00:11:02,309 --> 00:11:06,000
saturation so this this pink actually

248
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,300
want to use let's use it's like blue

249
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:14,790
again so if i'm at like fulbright so if

250
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:17,220
i start down here and i slowly ramp this

251
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:19,230
up i see blue and green going up but no

252
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:22,649
red and as i keep getting further like

253
00:11:22,649 --> 00:11:24,959
red finally starts to kick in and it

254
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:27,059
kind of goes higher so that it kind of

255
00:11:27,059 --> 00:11:28,350
makes sense again I'm not going to be

256
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:29,970
able to tell you what color would cause

257
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:32,519
what to happen the other cool thing may

258
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:34,199
like relationship that kind of makes

259
00:11:34,199 --> 00:11:35,910
sense is as you go from like full

260
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:38,309
saturation down the left saturation

261
00:11:38,309 --> 00:11:39,899
these like red green and blue is kind of

262
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:43,019
all merge together which again maybe

263
00:11:43,019 --> 00:11:46,160
make sense if you if you play with this

264
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,629
it so great so I can specify color

265
00:11:48,629 --> 00:11:52,800
hopefully more intuitively than RGB to

266
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,800
another person so what about making

267
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:59,249
doing some stuff with those colors so

268
00:11:59,249 --> 00:12:01,079
back to the original example just

269
00:12:01,079 --> 00:12:04,050
lightening this orange so I have human

270
00:12:04,050 --> 00:12:05,279
saturation specified

271
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:08,389
and all I do is increase the lightness

272
00:12:08,389 --> 00:12:11,540
so that's a lighter version of orange

273
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:14,790
this is me at the dentist with my

274
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:17,189
hygienist Linda and my little dog Coco

275
00:12:17,189 --> 00:12:19,199
who likes to go with me and make sure

276
00:12:19,199 --> 00:12:22,740
that Linda's not going to mess me up and

277
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:25,499
so if I went a nice gray scale version

278
00:12:25,499 --> 00:12:27,899
of this photo I would just desaturate

279
00:12:27,899 --> 00:12:30,300
these colors and I get this this more

280
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:34,889
timeless photo or like in my just one

281
00:12:34,889 --> 00:12:36,779
like maybe a cool washed out version i

282
00:12:36,779 --> 00:12:39,629
can go to like around here so that's

283
00:12:39,629 --> 00:12:41,819
great scaling a photo that's cool um and

284
00:12:41,819 --> 00:12:44,339
if you saw Amy's talked yesterday about

285
00:12:44,339 --> 00:12:46,079
making art or you played with the lights

286
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:49,230
in the other room this also comes up

287
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:51,749
often is they were using it yourself for

288
00:12:51,749 --> 00:12:53,910
a very specific reason and that's

289
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:55,319
actually if you've ever tried to like

290
00:12:55,319 --> 00:12:58,319
make a color palette with RGB it doesn't

291
00:12:58,319 --> 00:13:00,959
make any sense like everything else but

292
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:03,620
if you just okay so say let's pick yeah

293
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:06,449
like a nice red all right I kind of like

294
00:13:06,449 --> 00:13:08,399
this like this cool looking red right

295
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:10,740
here I like this red based on saturation

296
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:12,420
lightness values I just pick and I just

297
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:15,059
rotate through all the hues I end up

298
00:13:15,059 --> 00:13:16,889
with like colors that kind of fit

299
00:13:16,889 --> 00:13:20,730
together and they they they go together

300
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:22,259
if you tried to do this without you be

301
00:13:22,259 --> 00:13:24,629
you end up with all these weird colors

302
00:13:24,629 --> 00:13:28,170
that just don't look right okay

303
00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:30,000
hopefully I've convinced you that hsl is

304
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,850
really awesome and you want to use it so

305
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:35,879
how do you use it so it's already kind

306
00:13:35,879 --> 00:13:38,160
of everywhere you guys cough website

307
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:41,939
check out the body so this is in RGB hex

308
00:13:41,939 --> 00:13:44,579
triplet if you mouse over this it even

309
00:13:44,579 --> 00:13:46,050
tells you now you can shift click and

310
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:49,589
you can see all these different color

311
00:13:49,589 --> 00:13:54,000
space things and you can edit this and

312
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,819
if I just kind of change the hue it goes

313
00:13:56,819 --> 00:13:59,069
through all the hues so that's pretty

314
00:13:59,069 --> 00:14:01,290
cool and so all the tools that you use

315
00:14:01,290 --> 00:14:06,329
that support RGB I'm i will bet you some

316
00:14:06,329 --> 00:14:08,610
money maybe not a lot of money but some

317
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:10,350
money that they will also support hsl

318
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:13,470
and CSS like sports hsl all the browsers

319
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:15,079
support hsl you can just write that out

320
00:14:15,079 --> 00:14:18,870
and so there's some maybe not support

321
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:19,170
forward

322
00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:21,389
a preprocessor or other thing will

323
00:14:21,389 --> 00:14:24,810
actually just translate it for you okay

324
00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:29,490
so ah so I was just telling you all

325
00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:32,190
these cool things about hsl so if you

326
00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:34,110
were to say take all the people in the

327
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:35,639
world that we're really excited about

328
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:38,370
like color and lighting and like they

329
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:39,570
have conferences together they're

330
00:14:39,570 --> 00:14:40,740
actually called the commission

331
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:44,760
internationale de lis damage or cie for

332
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:48,660
short it's kind of like all of us except

333
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:50,880
who really geeked out about color and

334
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,940
lighting and like how the eye works and

335
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:55,470
they like get together and have

336
00:14:55,470 --> 00:14:56,670
conferences except they call them

337
00:14:56,670 --> 00:15:00,180
symposiums and and they talk about all

338
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:01,320
the stuff so they actually have they

339
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:03,149
publish their own color space it's

340
00:15:03,149 --> 00:15:06,120
called cie lab that is actually probably

341
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:09,990
cooler than hsl um it's like the new the

342
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:13,680
new Frank Ocean album of hsl not con

343
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:18,990
Yenny well he's so passe oh so so if you

344
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:20,850
want to talk about cool color spaces i

345
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:23,449
would love to talk to you about lab and

346
00:15:23,449 --> 00:15:26,370
let's see i do want to end on a song

347
00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:30,180
okay are there any Elvis Presley fans in

348
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:33,329
the audience okay good oh sorry then I

349
00:15:33,329 --> 00:15:35,010
apologize ahead of time because i'm

350
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:40,220
going to do injustice to his song okay

351
00:15:40,220 --> 00:16:20,430
let's see

352
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:40,810
would it be I guess like a.j scoff has

353
00:16:40,810 --> 00:16:46,370
surely too much react dan so it goes

354
00:16:46,370 --> 00:17:15,679
that something take my advice all right

355
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:21,079
everyone like a.j is conf has surely too

356
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:28,150
much react and so it goes that something

357
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:49,500
to my word take my own advice cuz i can

358
00:17:49,510 --> 00:18:14,850
using H and sell high kiss no using H

359
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:24,980
falling in love with you right ah so

360
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:26,840
