00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:16,509

I'd like to give a shout out to the jas

2
00:00:16,509 --> 00:00:17,859
kana organizers because this has been

3
00:00:17,859 --> 00:00:21,009
just an absolute dream I've had the time

4
00:00:21,009 --> 00:00:23,380
of my life and I've never felt this way

5
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:28,939
before it's so true I owe it all to you

6
00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:32,769
so hi I'm Jacob and I'm here to talk to

7
00:00:32,769 --> 00:00:34,989
you all about community about finding

8
00:00:34,989 --> 00:00:37,000
agency within your own communities and

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,829
about maintaining a service-oriented

10
00:00:38,829 --> 00:00:41,409
mindset in your community I'm from

11
00:00:41,409 --> 00:00:43,030
Rockford Illinois for those of you who

12
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:44,860
don't know Rockford is about an hour and

13
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:46,899
a half west of Chicago which means that

14
00:00:46,899 --> 00:00:47,890
we're like an hour and a half from

15
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:49,329
anything we're an hour and a half from

16
00:00:49,329 --> 00:00:52,480
Chicago Milwaukee Madison Quad Cities

17
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:56,260
and we're yeah it's an interesting place

18
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:59,440
to be I've got a two-year-old so that's

19
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:00,850
a constant adventure in my life I'm a

20
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:02,559
recent homeowner I do things outside of

21
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:04,600
the JavaScript community and the

22
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:07,539
development community because yeah don't

23
00:01:07,539 --> 00:01:10,929
we all and I also happen to run a

24
00:01:10,929 --> 00:01:13,270
developer meetup group in rockford there

25
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:17,890
are about 150 developers about half of

26
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:21,099
those qualify under the general like web

27
00:01:21,099 --> 00:01:25,720
technologies umbrella so I can't really

28
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:27,190
talk to you all about community without

29
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:30,119
talking about my first community

30
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:33,280
pictured here is my mom and and and my

31
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,619
family on her 65th birthday we bought

32
00:01:35,619 --> 00:01:37,869
her 65 roses because it seems like the

33
00:01:37,869 --> 00:01:39,340
sort of extravagant thing that my father

34
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:41,259
would have done he passed a couple of

35
00:01:41,259 --> 00:01:44,679
years ago and when I was younger he

36
00:01:44,679 --> 00:01:47,020
taught me all about being of service and

37
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:49,000
doing small kindnesses for people

38
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,110
without expecting anything in return

39
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:52,300
because that's just how we make our

40
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:55,509
lives better we improve our situation by

41
00:01:55,509 --> 00:01:58,780
impressing on to it the the things that

42
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:00,729
really make it great so think little

43
00:02:00,729 --> 00:02:02,229
things like holding doors for people and

44
00:02:02,229 --> 00:02:03,489
saying please and thank you like you

45
00:02:03,489 --> 00:02:05,259
wouldn't believe how much that improves

46
00:02:05,259 --> 00:02:08,379
your life right and that really that

47
00:02:08,379 --> 00:02:09,759
service-oriented mindset really

48
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:12,730
continues on today in doing things for

49
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:14,800
my mother when I was really young my

50
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,690
father I was raised Jewish and my father

51
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:19,330
taught me about in Judaism we had these

52
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:21,219
principles these these laws of Sedaka

53
00:02:21,219 --> 00:02:23,980
which roughly translates to charity but

54
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:25,240
it's really about more than that

55
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,040
and there are there are eight different

56
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,290
levels but the the highest attainment is

57
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:32,680
being able to serve somebody in order to

58
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:35,380
give them the tools that they need to

59
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:37,330
continue on serving themselves making

60
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:39,100
somebody self-reliant and so that's

61
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:41,650
really a principle that I've taken to

62
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:45,580
heart in everything that I do I can't

63
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:46,780
really talk to you all about community

64
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:47,830
without talking about a community I

65
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:50,320
spent 40 plus hours a week with I work

66
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,210
for a small marketing agency called

67
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:54,670
Quiet like communications or 20 people

68
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:58,330
strong and four of us are Deb's and we

69
00:02:58,330 --> 00:03:01,180
build client websites for for food

70
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:07,540
industry or with for bida reset we work

71
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:09,970
in business-to-business within the food

72
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:11,860
industry mainly with like food

73
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:13,360
ingredients manufacturers food equipment

74
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,570
manufacturers things like that and so

75
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:19,180
the devs acquire light just like build

76
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:21,100
websites all day and it's pretty great

77
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:24,070
even though we build a product we're

78
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:25,630
still in a service-oriented industry

79
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:28,030
where the client really comes first as

80
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:29,890
you can see the place that I work really

81
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:32,770
hires for culture we like to do fun

82
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:35,710
things in addition to to really learning

83
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:39,940
about our craft together I can't really

84
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:41,170
talk to you about community without

85
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:42,190
telling you a little bit about the

86
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:45,040
community that I live in I really try

87
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,800
and share my values about community in

88
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,110
the place that I live and I try to do so

89
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:52,780
in running a meet-up like I said there

90
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:55,360
are about 150 devs locally at our meetup

91
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,030
we get between 10 and 15 on a good night

92
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:01,840
so if any of you out there from the

93
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,460
meetup in a small town you know exactly

94
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:05,350
what I'm talking about Rockford is an

95
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:06,820
interesting place it has a very proud

96
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:09,310
past it was a furniture manufacturing

97
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:10,510
town and then an industrial

98
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:12,580
manufacturing town and then like a lot

99
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:15,220
of nothing and then over the last few

100
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:16,960
decades there's been a lot of racial and

101
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:19,150
class segregation which has just been

102
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:21,549
expounded since the market collapsed in

103
00:04:21,549 --> 00:04:24,100
2008 and as such people are really a

104
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:28,510
pathetic and its really like climbing a

105
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:31,960
pill to get people to act I put the

106
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,820
slide up here taco bell Rockford's

107
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:35,320
number one Mexican restaurant a little

108
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:37,810
tongue-in-cheek because I really do love

109
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:38,330
the play

110
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:41,050
that I live and and it this is not

111
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:43,970
representative of the type of people

112
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:45,409
that I try and surround myself with

113
00:04:45,409 --> 00:04:47,599
which is really like everybody I talked

114
00:04:47,599 --> 00:04:48,830
to because everybody's got an

115
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,810
interesting story to tell but with such

116
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:52,310
a social apathy it's really hard

117
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:53,710
sometimes it's like climbing uphill

118
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:56,090
pulling teeth to get people to do

119
00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:58,969
anything but I'm really here to talk

120
00:04:58,969 --> 00:05:00,800
about developers developers developers

121
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,620
developers developers developers

122
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:10,129
developers you guys you all so that

123
00:05:10,129 --> 00:05:12,409
being said how many meetup order

just so I can get a awesome people

126
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,340
sitting next to meetup organizers turn

127
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:21,190
to them and thank them because they do

128
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:25,849
wonderful things for you I also have to

129
00:05:25,849 --> 00:05:28,490
give a shout-out to the ongoing Twitter

130
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:30,139
battle between two people whose names I

131
00:05:30,139 --> 00:05:31,909
have totally forgotten that has resulted

132
00:05:31,909 --> 00:05:34,870
in a karaoke kamikaze karaoke

133
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:37,069
competition between meetup organizers

134
00:05:37,069 --> 00:05:39,110
that was fantastic I'm glad I didn't go

135
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:42,379
last night so I have a voice today right

136
00:05:42,379 --> 00:05:44,900
here pictured is my co organizer Michael

137
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:46,729
Hopkins he also happens to be a

138
00:05:46,729 --> 00:05:49,250
co-worker of mine you can follow him on

139
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:50,900
Twitter here and totally surprised them

140
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:51,860
because I didn't tell him his Twitter

141
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:53,870
handle was going in this talk he's

142
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:55,759
really my better half and if any of you

143
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:57,289
have a co-organizer you know exactly

144
00:05:57,289 --> 00:06:00,199
what I'm talking about so really what's

145
00:06:00,199 --> 00:06:04,370
what's a meetup really you all are at

146
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:07,129
jas conf you should know this a meetup

147
00:06:07,129 --> 00:06:11,419
is for me a place that I can have an

148
00:06:11,419 --> 00:06:12,889
outlet professionally because when I

149
00:06:12,889 --> 00:06:14,930
talk to my nan dev friends about what I

150
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:16,729
do it's like talking to a brick wall

151
00:06:16,729 --> 00:06:19,099
when I talk to other developers they

152
00:06:19,099 --> 00:06:20,210
understand exactly what I'm talking

153
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:22,159
about i said--that's script hung and it

154
00:06:22,159 --> 00:06:23,629
kept me there until seven o'clock and

155
00:06:23,629 --> 00:06:25,069
i'm just i really want to break

156
00:06:25,069 --> 00:06:27,830
something right now you all know exactly

157
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:30,080
what that's like I meet up for me is a

158
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,400
place where I can go and I can learn

159
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,050
things from other people that know cool

160
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:34,789
stuff and hopefully integrate that into

161
00:06:34,789 --> 00:06:36,259
my workflow and its place where I can

162
00:06:36,259 --> 00:06:38,029
share some of the things that I've

163
00:06:38,029 --> 00:06:40,930
learned throughout throughout my time

164
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:45,289
programming but what makes a good meet

165
00:06:45,289 --> 00:06:48,259
up I would say that it's about the users

166
00:06:48,259 --> 00:06:51,740
period on any of you are a fan of

167
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:53,000
attire and art you might already know

168
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,330
jen jen Schiffer brings communities of

169
00:06:56,330 --> 00:06:58,610
art and code together in a really

170
00:06:58,610 --> 00:07:00,590
wonderful way and a couple weeks ago was

171
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:03,590
talking about our code being really

172
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:06,979
ephemeral and the the thing that's

173
00:07:06,979 --> 00:07:08,720
important in a developer community is

174
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,000
the people not the code the code just

175
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,370
doesn't matter so I would say success is

176
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:15,440
really in the eye of the beholder if you

177
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,240
have happy people at your meetup you're

178
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:20,509
going to have a healthy meet up so to

179
00:07:20,509 --> 00:07:24,960
that end or your users staying engaged

180
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:29,990
that is really what matters most so

181
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:32,240
where do I fit in all of this how did I

182
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,449
come to to run a meetup and try and

183
00:07:35,449 --> 00:07:37,580
organize communities when I was a kid I

184
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:39,770
read a lot of sci-fi and I dreamed of

185
00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:41,569
these these gorgeous places these

186
00:07:41,569 --> 00:07:43,580
utopians cities where everything was

187
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:46,340
beautiful and like everybody had a place

188
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:50,840
and it was all great and then I grew up

189
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:53,750
I realized that maybe my expectations

190
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:58,669
were a bit unrealistic overinflated and

191
00:07:58,669 --> 00:08:02,240
the takeaway from this is that just

192
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,340
because not everybody doesn't abide by

193
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:06,620
these same utopian ideals doesn't mean

194
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:08,570
that I can't try and bring some of that

195
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:13,370
to my day-to-day life when I was younger

196
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:15,440
I played a lot of music and in playing

197
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,180
music I learned a lot about patience for

198
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:19,219
others because everybody learns at a

199
00:08:19,219 --> 00:08:21,259
different pace and everybody does things

200
00:08:21,259 --> 00:08:23,270
slightly differently and just because

201
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:25,280
it's a little bit different some a

202
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,509
little bit slower some a little bit

203
00:08:26,509 --> 00:08:28,159
faster that doesn't make it bad that

204
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:30,830
makes it you know full of personality

205
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:32,899
right which is what we seek out of our

206
00:08:32,899 --> 00:08:34,250
communities if everybody were the same

207
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:36,579
it'd be no fun I learned a lot about

208
00:08:36,579 --> 00:08:38,810
collaboration when I played music

209
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:40,190
because I played in ensembles and

210
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:42,589
orchestras I played with my peers from

211
00:08:42,589 --> 00:08:44,360
the time I was like knee high to a duck

212
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,820
until I graduated high school if any of

213
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:48,829
you out there are musicians or other

214
00:08:48,829 --> 00:08:50,329
collaborative other otherwise

215
00:08:50,329 --> 00:08:52,100
collaborative artists I hope all of you

216
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:54,220
now that you've seen Steve Kenny's talk

217
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:56,870
you can really appreciate where I'm

218
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:59,570
coming from here some of you might say

219
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:02,420
it's a little bit low-tech but I I would

220
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:04,250
submit that most of the communities that

221
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:05,400
were a part of our not

222
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,650
focused so this is really important

223
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:10,020
everywhere all of the communities that

224
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:12,540
were part of from our families to the

225
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:14,640
people we might ride the bus with or

226
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,890
share a car with to our co-workers

227
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:18,630
regardless of whether they're Deb's are

228
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:21,990
not communication community patients for

229
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:23,460
others being of service to others these

230
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:27,360
are important things everywhere when I

231
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,250
got out of high school I moved to

232
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:31,500
Chicago and I started working for this

233
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,000
company called the Chicago technology

234
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:38,700
cooperative and I learned how to build

235
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:41,160
websites for our clients which were

236
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:44,010
typically nonprofit organizations one of

237
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:47,250
my mentors that I met here by the name

238
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:51,150
of David EADS he also helped found a

239
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:54,270
place called free geek Chicago if any of

240
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:55,500
you are familiar with the free geek

241
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,150
organization I heard I yes over there

242
00:09:57,150 --> 00:10:00,660
it's a fantastic place and free geek

243
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:01,950
Chicago is an autonomous organization

244
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:05,400
that takes its structure from what they

245
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,140
call the mothership free deke Portland

246
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:08,910
which was the original foundational

247
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:10,650
place but it's a place where everybody

248
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:13,200
can go and they can learn how to tear

249
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,640
apart a computer how to rebuild a

250
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:15,750
computer how to install some software

251
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:17,730
and it's a really empowering place

252
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:19,230
because it really serves a need in the

253
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:20,610
community there's a lot of people out

254
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:22,680
there who just can't afford a computer

255
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:25,110
and so if they can go to this place and

256
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:27,090
they can learn not just about computers

257
00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:30,030
but about computing in a much larger

258
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:32,760
sense it's it's really an opportunity

259
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:36,270
for them and after I think it is now 25

260
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:38,130
hours of service to this organization

261
00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:41,040
they get to leave with a computer so how

262
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,950
cool this at while I was there I learned

263
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:47,040
a lot about open source software and

264
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:50,040
some of these open source ideals that I

265
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:53,250
think we all tend to take for granted I

266
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:55,050
read this book called the cathedral and

267
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:56,790
the bazaar if some of you haven't read

268
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:58,590
it you really should because it's

269
00:10:58,590 --> 00:11:02,040
incredible it tells the story of how

270
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:04,670
traditional software development kind of

271
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:07,260
birthed the open source movement that's

272
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:08,730
written by a man named eric raymond

273
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:10,560
who's a self-described open-source

274
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:13,710
historian and in it eric says that open

275
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:15,600
source development breaks this bind

276
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,880
talking about the traditional roles that

277
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,170
people inhabit and software

278
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:20,910
making it easier for tester and

279
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:21,899
developer to develop a shared

280
00:11:21,899 --> 00:11:23,790
representation to communicate

281
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:27,209
effectively about it this quote talks

282
00:11:27,209 --> 00:11:29,550
about open source development but it's

283
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:32,339
relevant in to communication models in

284
00:11:32,339 --> 00:11:34,589
all communities so to this i would say

285
00:11:34,589 --> 00:11:36,540
break down your pre defined role

286
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:38,310
definitions and serve in the capacity

287
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:40,380
that you decide if you want to teach

288
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:42,389
something teach something if you want to

289
00:11:42,389 --> 00:11:44,339
learn something learn something if you

290
00:11:44,339 --> 00:11:46,110
want to participate participate in

291
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:49,350
whatever way it fits you best and do it

292
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:50,490
to the best of your ability because

293
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:55,440
that's really where you shine so given

294
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,589
what you know about my background I

295
00:11:57,589 --> 00:12:00,899
would say now that meetups are a

296
00:12:00,899 --> 00:12:04,110
wonderful way to learn meetups are an

297
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:06,899
opportunity to teach and meetups are a

298
00:12:06,899 --> 00:12:08,250
chance to become a better version of

299
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:15,680
ourselves a wonderful way to learn an

300
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,029
opportunity to teach and a chance to

301
00:12:18,029 --> 00:12:18,930
become a better version of ourselves

302
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:22,709
think about that sounds a lot like open

303
00:12:22,709 --> 00:12:26,029
source but you know in the meat space

304
00:12:26,029 --> 00:12:32,550
it's pretty cool so you know learning we

305
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:34,079
hope that's what the takeaway is every

306
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:36,240
time I go to a meetup I leave with

307
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,519
something new and that inspires me to

308
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:40,680
continue going to the meetups because I

309
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,750
learned something and it's cool and I

310
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:45,079
get to integrate that into my life

311
00:12:45,079 --> 00:12:48,269
meetups for teaching just because

312
00:12:48,269 --> 00:12:50,579
there's somebody talking about something

313
00:12:50,579 --> 00:12:52,170
at a meetup and that's like the focus of

314
00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:54,149
the meetup doesn't mean that you can't

315
00:12:54,149 --> 00:12:57,000
teach something even as somebody that is

316
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,910
just there participating because when

317
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:01,110
you're sitting at the table and you're

318
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:02,839
having a conversation with somebody

319
00:13:02,839 --> 00:13:05,699
whether it's about the topic of the

320
00:13:05,699 --> 00:13:08,250
meetup that night or it's about you know

321
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:09,870
whatever chances are you're teaching

322
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:11,670
them something and chances are they're

323
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:13,769
learning something from you so i would

324
00:13:13,769 --> 00:13:15,240
say that teaching is really about being

325
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:17,569
involved and about having a conversation

326
00:13:17,569 --> 00:13:22,110
and who feels better after me up I know

327
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:24,060
like when I leave a meetup I'm just

328
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:26,390
jazzed about like everything

329
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:28,570
and similarly with conferences like

330
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:31,070
there's this like great feeling after a

331
00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:32,800
conference when you're like yeah

332
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:37,190
javascript all the things and and then

333
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:38,810
you go back to reality but that doesn't

334
00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:40,070
mean that you didn't take something away

335
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:43,460
from it and hopefully start to do

336
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:44,840
something you know maybe a little bit

337
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,070
different do something that you haven't

338
00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:48,050
done before try something out and you

339
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:49,430
know just have fun with what you do

340
00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:51,980
because it's what you do I think that

341
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:53,690
self-improvement is really intrinsically

342
00:13:53,690 --> 00:14:02,050
motivating so what do you do every day

343
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:05,540
sit on Stack Overflow you consult the

344
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:08,680
docs of MTN you google a lot of stuff

345
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:10,880
hopefully you're on IRC doing more than

346
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,590
just lurking I'm totally guilty of that

347
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:16,130
I could make an entire presentation like

348
00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:18,470
way more than 30 minutes with the list

349
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:20,120
of resources that we have available to

350
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:22,850
us on line through this technology that

351
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:25,160
we've created the list really goes on on

352
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:27,590
and on but wouldn't you rather talk

353
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:29,690
about it in person when you rather hear

354
00:14:29,690 --> 00:14:32,180
how somebody used a certain tool then oh

355
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:35,420
hey that tool exists i would say that

356
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:36,650
our colleagues are a most valuable

357
00:14:36,650 --> 00:14:39,320
resource and their experience is the

358
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,820
most important thing that they have to

359
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:45,050
offer so remember before how we talked

360
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:47,180
about user engagement what did your

361
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:52,490
users need when I so I moved away from

362
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:55,160
Rockford for a little bit and then I

363
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,620
moved back about three years ago three

364
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:59,600
and a half years ago and I started going

365
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,870
to meet up in the area and at the time

366
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:05,750
we had a PHP meet up we had a javascript

367
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:08,480
meetup there was a dotnet meet up Coco

368
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,160
me too but linux meet up and I tried to

369
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,960
get to as many of those as possible but

370
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,460
I'm really going to focus on PHP and

371
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:16,250
JavaScript because that's what I use so

372
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:17,840
I went to these PHP and javascript

373
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,640
meetup sand and they were struggling a

374
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:21,500
little bit because in a town as you can

375
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:24,560
imagine with 150 developers or so and

376
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,870
like half of them use web technologies

377
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:29,630
that's a pool of about 70 people to try

378
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:32,450
and drag out every month and not

379
00:15:32,450 --> 00:15:34,700
everybody has the time to do that and at

380
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,290
the time that I was starting to attend

381
00:15:36,290 --> 00:15:38,960
meetups in the Rockford area the PHP

382
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,259
group was really lagging behind

383
00:15:40,259 --> 00:15:42,989
the organizer had gotten really busy

384
00:15:42,989 --> 00:15:45,269
with work and had moved out of town and

385
00:15:45,269 --> 00:15:47,429
really kind of just like left it up in

386
00:15:47,429 --> 00:15:49,290
the air and there were maybe three to

387
00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:50,939
five people in average attendance and

388
00:15:50,939 --> 00:15:53,309
the JavaScript group well JavaScript a

389
00:15:53,309 --> 00:15:54,569
scary thing that some people i don't

390
00:15:54,569 --> 00:15:57,119
know why but it was similarly poorly

391
00:15:57,119 --> 00:16:00,059
attended and at the javascript group we

392
00:16:00,059 --> 00:16:01,919
happened to have this this wonderful

393
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:03,299
personality i don't know if any of you

394
00:16:03,299 --> 00:16:05,220
know Cory Frank you should also follow

395
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:08,699
him Cory is the kind of person that can

396
00:16:08,699 --> 00:16:10,679
can like riff off the cuff about like

397
00:16:10,679 --> 00:16:12,779
anything javascript and it will sound

398
00:16:12,779 --> 00:16:14,669
interesting and cool and it will be

399
00:16:14,669 --> 00:16:16,889
engaging and and then Corey moved away

400
00:16:16,889 --> 00:16:19,769
and so similarly the JavaScript group

401
00:16:19,769 --> 00:16:23,429
was left without a leader and so Michael

402
00:16:23,429 --> 00:16:25,199
my co-organizer who I showed earlier and

403
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:28,589
myself we kind of took on these two

404
00:16:28,589 --> 00:16:30,269
groups and we decided that hey we really

405
00:16:30,269 --> 00:16:32,669
needed to combine our focus and our

406
00:16:32,669 --> 00:16:35,369
efforts because we would better serve

407
00:16:35,369 --> 00:16:39,089
our community if we had more resources

408
00:16:39,089 --> 00:16:44,639
at our disposal ie each other so meetups

409
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:46,679
are really about doing what's best for

410
00:16:46,679 --> 00:16:49,499
your community it's about sharing

411
00:16:49,499 --> 00:16:52,079
interest you know there are overlaps in

412
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:54,989
all programming technologies and you

413
00:16:54,989 --> 00:16:56,759
know just because a JavaScript

414
00:16:56,759 --> 00:16:58,079
conference doesn't mean I can't talk

415
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:00,419
about you know PHP or net or whatever

416
00:17:00,419 --> 00:17:01,829
I've talked to so many of you who use

417
00:17:01,829 --> 00:17:04,919
these technologies meetups are about

418
00:17:04,919 --> 00:17:09,480
professional networking and support so

419
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,789
now that we've qualified a meet-up how

420
00:17:11,789 --> 00:17:16,409
do we run one so remember when I was

421
00:17:16,409 --> 00:17:17,819
talking about my co-organizer I keep

422
00:17:17,819 --> 00:17:20,209
mentioning my co-organizer this guy

423
00:17:20,209 --> 00:17:22,769
share the load if you can another

424
00:17:22,769 --> 00:17:24,629
perspective and another set of hands can

425
00:17:24,629 --> 00:17:26,970
really help a lot of meetup organizers I

426
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:28,769
talked to actually have anywhere from

427
00:17:28,769 --> 00:17:30,870
three to five people that kind of take

428
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:33,629
up this mantle of bringing good meetup

429
00:17:33,629 --> 00:17:36,210
content to the area and the more people

430
00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:37,950
you have the more you can share the load

431
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:40,139
and the more consistent your meetup will

432
00:17:40,139 --> 00:17:42,419
be as a result and people love

433
00:17:42,419 --> 00:17:46,919
consistency to run a meetup you need a

434
00:17:46,919 --> 00:17:48,779
code of conduct you all had better know

435
00:17:48,779 --> 00:17:50,399
what this is because you agreed to one

436
00:17:50,399 --> 00:17:51,910
in attending today

437
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:56,900
so in talking with David EADS a mentor

438
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:59,930
that I had mentioned before so when he

439
00:17:59,930 --> 00:18:03,290
was organizing freak Chicago for a while

440
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:04,940
they ran without a code of conduct and

441
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:07,730
there were situations in which people

442
00:18:07,730 --> 00:18:09,620
felt unsafe and they decided that they

443
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:12,710
couldn't come back because they just

444
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:14,990
didn't have any guarantees that they

445
00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:18,530
would be safe there so I'm code of

446
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:20,180
conduct is really about solving that

447
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:22,550
problem it's about defining harassment

448
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:25,400
explicitly and defining consequences for

449
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:28,430
harassment explicitly because people are

450
00:18:28,430 --> 00:18:30,110
going to be people and not everybody

451
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:32,420
knows how to act right after

452
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:34,520
implementing a code of conduct at free

453
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:36,350
geek Chicago there were many many more

454
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:38,810
situations obviously we're personalities

455
00:18:38,810 --> 00:18:41,330
conflicted and and people were able to

456
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:43,970
learn how to act properly among each

457
00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:47,360
other and maintain their presence in

458
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,490
that space because again even if

459
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:50,840
somebody doesn't know how to act right

460
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:52,640
doesn't mean they don't have something

461
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,380
valuable to contribute so we really want

462
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:58,280
to avoid that problem and really nobody

463
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:01,010
is above reproach so these things this

464
00:19:01,010 --> 00:19:04,760
is a really necessary thing to lead a

465
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:08,750
meet-up you need space no this kind of

466
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:11,360
space you need a table and chairs you

467
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,130
need hopefully a projector if you've got

468
00:19:13,130 --> 00:19:14,900
more than a couple people to be able to

469
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:17,570
share what you're talking about you know

470
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:21,650
some pizza really helps personally we

471
00:19:21,650 --> 00:19:23,300
have a space that's sponsored by a

472
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:27,110
business that some of our attendees are

473
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:29,360
a part of and that's wonderful if you

474
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,620
can get a business to sponsor your

475
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:32,420
meetup most businesses have conference

476
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:33,950
rooms with things like a table and

477
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:35,720
chairs and projectors and some of them

478
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:37,040
might even be willing to sponsor some

479
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:40,400
pizza if you don't have an opportunity

480
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,470
for that i would suggest contacting

481
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:45,020
local universities or colleges if you

482
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:46,820
have any nearby because they love

483
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:48,560
learning opportunities that's what's

484
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:50,930
there about right and chances are

485
00:19:50,930 --> 00:19:54,530
they'll give you plenty of free advice

486
00:19:54,530 --> 00:19:57,590
and they will spread your name like

487
00:19:57,590 --> 00:20:01,040
wildfire and hopefully with you know

488
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:02,480
students attending universities and

489
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,440
colleges you'll get a couple more people

490
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:06,990
also I would say that if you're small

491
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:09,930
enough coffee shop or a brewery or

492
00:20:09,930 --> 00:20:12,900
whatever happens to work go with that

493
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:15,270
because you do need a space but as you

494
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:16,860
grow you will notice that you will need

495
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:20,220
a more defined intentional space for

496
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:24,300
this I would say you also need internet

497
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:26,100
I mean how many times have you gone to a

498
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:27,810
conference or a meetup and the internet

499
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:29,580
is just crap and you notice it right

500
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:30,870
away it's the first thing you notice

501
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:32,010
because you pull out your laptops or

502
00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:35,970
your phone you're like what but when it

503
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:38,640
works it works and it's great so have

504
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:43,170
internet at your meetup I would say that

505
00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:46,740
you need some tools specifically shared

506
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:48,570
calendars and documents are wonderful

507
00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:49,860
you know when you're running a meet-up

508
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:50,820
and you're trying to have some

509
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:52,440
consistency it's nice to schedule things

510
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:55,500
out maybe if you're you know writing a

511
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,030
code of conduct it's nice to be able to

512
00:20:57,030 --> 00:21:00,780
collaborate on that you also should

513
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:02,640
probably use some social media we build

514
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,290
these tools where we can type something

515
00:21:04,290 --> 00:21:05,910
in or take a picture or whatever and

516
00:21:05,910 --> 00:21:07,710
blast it out to hundreds and thousands

517
00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:10,860
of people and you know so use that to

518
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:12,930
your advantage don't be afraid to go old

519
00:21:12,930 --> 00:21:14,610
school though because email lists are

520
00:21:14,610 --> 00:21:15,690
something that a lot of people

521
00:21:15,690 --> 00:21:18,840
appreciate I know when I say okay I'm

522
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:20,070
going to go to this meetup I appreciate

523
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:21,660
getting an email with the ical

524
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:23,910
attachment and like putting it on my

525
00:21:23,910 --> 00:21:25,980
calendar then it's everywhere so don't

526
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:28,550
discount the older technologies

527
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:31,380
personally we use meetup com because

528
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:33,180
again it's a business sponsored solution

529
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:36,360
it's free to a certain point but the the

530
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:39,290
paid version does extra stuff I think

531
00:21:39,290 --> 00:21:41,550
it's by no means an end-all be-all

532
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:44,580
solution but it does a lot of these

533
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:47,280
things pretty well and it works for me

534
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,680
so take that with a grain of salt there

535
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:51,750
might be some potential detractors like

536
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:53,850
I've heard things heard some negativity

537
00:21:53,850 --> 00:21:56,010
about recruiters finding out about

538
00:21:56,010 --> 00:21:57,720
meetups and then coming to like suck the

539
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,010
life out of your meetup because they

540
00:21:59,010 --> 00:22:00,300
don't really recruiters don't really

541
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:02,400
seek to contribute they just want to

542
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:05,190
pull resource right and you ideally

543
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:10,680
don't want that at your meetup

544
00:22:10,690 --> 00:22:14,540
so in keeping it going remember to focus

545
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:17,840
on your users it's all about the users

546
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:20,420
all the time if you're serving your

547
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:22,070
users if you're engaging your users if

548
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:23,750
you're keeping them happy they will keep

549
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:25,190
coming back they will bring people back

550
00:22:25,190 --> 00:22:29,240
and your meetup will grow and don't be

551
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:32,120
afraid to do something different our

552
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:34,190
industry is no stranger to this concept

553
00:22:34,190 --> 00:22:36,890
of pivoting some of us in like the most

554
00:22:36,890 --> 00:22:39,020
radical obscene ways and this is really

555
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:40,730
about a tactic for topics not the

556
00:22:40,730 --> 00:22:42,080
entirety of a meetup I wouldn't suggest

557
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:46,640
pivoting from like JavaScript to fortran

558
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:51,230
you know it might not work but for a

559
00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:52,970
while Michael and I were coming up with

560
00:22:52,970 --> 00:22:54,680
after we had combined efforts we were

561
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:57,170
coming up with topics and after a couple

562
00:22:57,170 --> 00:22:59,300
months that gets exhausting it's really

563
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:01,070
difficult to come up with content month

564
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:03,470
after month after month and that's not

565
00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:05,210
to say that we hadn't accomplished

566
00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:07,070
anything that month but you know we're

567
00:23:07,070 --> 00:23:08,960
busy people we have lives outside of

568
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,360
this text stuff and we want to be able

569
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:15,230
to participate in them so we started

570
00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:17,690
doing these geek dinners and it was

571
00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:19,210
fantastic for a little while because

572
00:23:19,210 --> 00:23:21,470
everybody was like hey let's go to this

573
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:23,090
brewery and we'll eat some good food and

574
00:23:23,090 --> 00:23:24,530
drink some good beer and it'll be like

575
00:23:24,530 --> 00:23:27,020
great it'll be awesome and then like

576
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:28,490
after a few months of that we kind of

577
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:31,040
got in a rut and realized that it wasn't

578
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:33,710
working so don't do that maybe like once

579
00:23:33,710 --> 00:23:36,890
a year twice at max but I would schedule

580
00:23:36,890 --> 00:23:39,050
it separately from the traditional

581
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:41,630
meetup format because people don't want

582
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:43,160
to go to a meetup to just like go to

583
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,750
dinner with a bunch of people like it's

584
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:46,250
cool to talk shop every once in a while

585
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:50,480
but people really crave new things at

586
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:53,240
amita people really crave ideas and when

587
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:55,160
you're talking about technology in

588
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:58,250
specific ways those ideas tend to flow

589
00:23:58,250 --> 00:24:02,060
so I think our last geek dinner was like

590
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:04,850
three people showed up it was abysmal it

591
00:24:04,850 --> 00:24:06,680
was really terrible and and this was

592
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:09,140
after we had gone through all the effort

593
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:11,750
of you know combining our two meet ups

594
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:14,090
to to this Rockford web devs thing and

595
00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:16,430
we were starting to reengage people and

596
00:24:16,430 --> 00:24:17,780
it was going really well and it felt

597
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:20,240
like we had fallen off of a cliff excuse

598
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,770
me

599
00:24:21,770 --> 00:24:24,620
so then we decided that we were going to

600
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:26,510
build something collaboratively as a

601
00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:29,240
group we put it up on github it's at

602
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:32,480
github com / Rockford web / paste bin

603
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:36,890
too I think they wanted to name it v7

604
00:24:36,890 --> 00:24:40,520
underscore final dash dash but you know

605
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,890
that fell through so over the course of

606
00:24:42,890 --> 00:24:44,810
like six or seven months we

607
00:24:44,810 --> 00:24:47,390
collaboratively built a paste bin clone

608
00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:51,080
and we basically just went to the group

609
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:53,180
and every other month Michael and I

610
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:55,460
would switch off coding while we

611
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:57,200
solicited input from everybody we're

612
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,150
like so we want to build this thing what

613
00:24:59,150 --> 00:25:01,190
would be the first step and we like went

614
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:02,780
through this whole creative process

615
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:05,510
together taking input so that everybody

616
00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:07,520
felt like they had something to offer

617
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,950
they felt like they were engaged by this

618
00:25:09,950 --> 00:25:12,680
process and they really contributed some

619
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:14,990
of them even contributed after hours and

620
00:25:14,990 --> 00:25:17,900
like made commits to the github which

621
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:20,680
was great you know that's what it's for

622
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:23,270
so through this project we've

623
00:25:23,270 --> 00:25:25,640
essentially tripled our engagement for

624
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:28,490
us that means we're up to a steady 12 to

625
00:25:28,490 --> 00:25:32,420
15 on a good night like 20-25 but when

626
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:34,100
you think about that in terms of the

627
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:35,870
overall community size talking about a

628
00:25:35,870 --> 00:25:38,830
pool of like 70 web technologies

629
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:41,720
developers you know that that is pretty

630
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:44,620
fantastic it has been for us anyway so

631
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:46,970
really don't be afraid to do something

632
00:25:46,970 --> 00:25:51,110
different and I would say also that you

633
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:53,210
should use your resources at hand and by

634
00:25:53,210 --> 00:25:55,490
this I mean human resources from the

635
00:25:55,490 --> 00:25:57,080
most personal the ones you're in contact

636
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:59,300
with every day to those that are semi

637
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:01,940
local regional or even like if you're a

638
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:03,620
java or j s conf and you're like hey

639
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:05,690
would you maybe want to talk at my meet

640
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:08,210
up and somebody might say yes you know

641
00:26:08,210 --> 00:26:10,790
you never know i would say talk to your

642
00:26:10,790 --> 00:26:12,530
friends be like hey i know you're not

643
00:26:12,530 --> 00:26:15,010
really into this whole development thing

644
00:26:15,010 --> 00:26:17,570
but could you like show up because

645
00:26:17,570 --> 00:26:19,580
having warm bodies in the room means

646
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:22,220
that people will perceive it as being a

647
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:24,080
successful thing where people share and

648
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,580
integrate and it works i mean for a

649
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:26,840
little bit while it really helps to

650
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:29,690
boost attendance and they might learn

651
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:32,330
something i hope they would don't be

652
00:26:32,330 --> 00:26:33,680
afraid to talk to your co-workers and

653
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:35,210
say hey there's this meetup thing that

654
00:26:35,210 --> 00:26:35,420
I'm

655
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:37,100
doing and you should really come because

656
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:38,930
it's totally relevant to what we do

657
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:41,960
every day but do that with some caution

658
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:43,940
because remember that not everybody has

659
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:46,130
time to commit to a meetup and that's

660
00:26:46,130 --> 00:26:48,830
okay so don't harass them about it

661
00:26:48,830 --> 00:26:52,220
please talk to your fellow meetup

662
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:53,690
attendees if you see somebody that's

663
00:26:53,690 --> 00:26:55,690
their week or a month after month and

664
00:26:55,690 --> 00:26:59,660
they just sit and patiently observe ask

665
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:01,280
them if they would like to share

666
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:02,900
something that they've learned I know

667
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:07,970
that for me when I am in that mode where

668
00:27:07,970 --> 00:27:11,420
I'm just like observing I don't often

669
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:13,520
think that I have something relevant to

670
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,800
contribute but things that might seem

671
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:19,190
totally mundane to me are maybe

672
00:27:19,190 --> 00:27:20,990
mind-blowing to the rest of you and vice

673
00:27:20,990 --> 00:27:22,730
versa like that's how this community

674
00:27:22,730 --> 00:27:25,730
works so if you help somebody else get

675
00:27:25,730 --> 00:27:28,310
out of their shell they will repay you

676
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:31,430
with the the most amazing talk you've

677
00:27:31,430 --> 00:27:34,610
ever heard don't be afraid to go to

678
00:27:34,610 --> 00:27:38,480
regional meetups you know it's not too

679
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:39,860
big of a deal for a lot of people to

680
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:41,750
jump in the car drive an hour hour and a

681
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:43,190
half if you don't have access to a car

682
00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:45,290
don't feel bad about that but you know

683
00:27:45,290 --> 00:27:47,450
if you if you look like within a 50-mile

684
00:27:47,450 --> 00:27:49,040
radius of where you're at chances are

685
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:51,110
there's other meetups around and even if

686
00:27:51,110 --> 00:27:52,700
they're not directly related to the

687
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:54,530
technology stack that you happen to be a

688
00:27:54,530 --> 00:27:56,810
super big fan of like chances are you'll

689
00:27:56,810 --> 00:27:58,520
learn something there and at those

690
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:00,470
places you can interact with people who

691
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:02,000
might be able to bring something back to

692
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,130
your meet up and say hey you know check

693
00:28:04,130 --> 00:28:06,320
this out you come and visit us you know

694
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:08,540
maybe share something I have to give a

695
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:10,370
shout out to the Madison PHP user group

696
00:28:10,370 --> 00:28:12,490
who has been especially helpful to us

697
00:28:12,490 --> 00:28:16,430
yeah they've been great and most

698
00:28:16,430 --> 00:28:21,320
importantly I mean this to say be of

699
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:22,940
service to each other this this

700
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:24,350
particular phrase be excellent to each

701
00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:26,240
other has had some some terrible

702
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,310
failings in our industry unfortunately

703
00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:30,410
hence the talk about codes of conduct

704
00:28:30,410 --> 00:28:33,200
and why that's important but if you if

705
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,440
you maintain a service-oriented mindset

706
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:38,600
then you know that's really what it's

707
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:40,550
about we're here to help each other it's

708
00:28:40,550 --> 00:28:44,450
how we grow it's how we learn so i

709
00:28:44,450 --> 00:28:45,890
really hope I've helped to impart a

710
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:48,750
thing or two about community here today

711
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:51,790
remember to be of service to your users

712
00:28:51,790 --> 00:28:54,340
above all without users there is no meet

713
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:58,270
up period so do what they want to a

714
00:28:58,270 --> 00:29:00,820
point know that you have complete

715
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:02,860
control over your participation I was

716
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:03,880
talking about open source software

717
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:05,740
redefining role definitions you know

718
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:09,790
really do what you want within the realm

719
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:12,910
that you want do your best at it and and

720
00:29:12,910 --> 00:29:16,180
it will be a wonderful thing and don't

721
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:17,800
be afraid to do something drastically

722
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:20,820
different the results will surprise you

723
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:50,109
thank you
