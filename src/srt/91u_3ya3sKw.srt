00:00:01,250 --> 00:00:03,780

hello hello can you what you can all

2
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:05,310
hear me you can alright that's good

3
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:05,819
right

4
00:00:05,819 --> 00:00:07,500
fantastic thank you for that wonderful

5
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:10,860
introduction from Kevin um I'm a

6
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:13,679
front-end designer developers you might

7
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:16,230
have heard and as you might also be able

8
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:20,220
to guess my accent I am also British but

9
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:22,769
please don't worry I'm actually one of

10
00:00:22,769 --> 00:00:24,779
those British people who likes Europe

11
00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:28,920
unlike everybody else in my country and

12
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:31,279
that's why I live in Berlin which is

13
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:34,739
such a beautiful amazing place but I was

14
00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:36,480
attracted by certain things they

15
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,510
attacked it's got some the best food on

16
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:40,020
the planet

17
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:42,329
really quite gourmet quality food which

18
00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:45,960
I love it's a very conservative and

19
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:48,120
quiet place where people keep to

20
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:51,420
themselves and it's just generally be

21
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:53,699
German it's gotta be nice quiet

22
00:00:53,699 --> 00:00:56,219
respectable attitude so I love living

23
00:00:56,219 --> 00:00:59,640
there and then the Berlin I word for

24
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:02,399
spring to nature as a senior front-end

25
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:05,189
dev and if you haven't heard of spring a

26
00:01:05,189 --> 00:01:07,860
nature it's actually one of the largest

27
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:09,930
academic and scientific publishers on

28
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:13,010
the planet so should have heard of them

29
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:15,509
justified by med central Scientific

30
00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:17,939
American and the eponymous journal

31
00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:21,299
Nature that kind of place where you get

32
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:22,710
published in there it's Nobel Prize

33
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:24,659
territory for you and he helps

34
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:26,700
scientists to get their work seen by

35
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:28,770
other scientists and the community in

36
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:32,250
general and I really love it there but I

37
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:34,939
didn't come to talk to you about that I

38
00:01:34,939 --> 00:01:38,040
I came to have just a quick chat about

39
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:40,650
the single biggest invention in human

40
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:43,740
history so hopefully I can go through

41
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:45,600
this in 30 minutes and it should be fine

42
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:52,320
it's no biggie and I just want to riff a

43
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,030
little bit on Jeremy Keith he he does

44
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:56,399
something based somewhere and I just

45
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:59,670
want to talk about the web about how

46
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:04,409
utterly incredible it is and it's

47
00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:07,290
incredible because of its Dominus it

48
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:10,349
really is done it's stupid and that's

49
00:02:10,349 --> 00:02:11,550
what makes amazing

50
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:13,950
it's a bunch of dumb stupid technologies

51
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:16,830
put together and they come to make

52
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:20,370
something amazing so I'm just going to

53
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:22,200
talk very quickly about some of those

54
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,580
things and I think we can safely say it

55
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:28,920
started with Telegraph's yeah

56
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,390
everybody's familiar with what

57
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:32,210
Telegraph's I love the B beebeep beebeep

58
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:36,210
kind of things yeah yeah and these

59
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:37,590
things completely changed the face of

60
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:41,150
global communication I mean we went from

61
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:44,340
weeks it would take to send a message

62
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:47,460
anywhere in the planet to seconds there

63
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:51,270
was such an incredible change and the

64
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:53,520
Telegraph allowed the invention of the

65
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,470
telephone you know people want to get in

66
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:56,550
on the act they wanted to get their

67
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:59,330
voices heard and that use the same wires

68
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:03,570
and then those telephones allowed the

69
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:06,450
invention of computer networks not

70
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:07,620
obviously we had to invent the computer

71
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:09,870
first but we those computers could then

72
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:12,600
communicate with each other and I don't

73
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,040
know if anyone else is blessed with

74
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,959
being gold enough to remember this

75
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:19,350
particular movie wargames Ike you

76
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:20,490
remember stuff with the acoustic

77
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:22,770
couplers you put the mode that telephone

78
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:26,010
on the modem then the modem screamed

79
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:28,140
another computer somewhere in the

80
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:29,940
distance and then that computer screen

81
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:32,250
back and they were all screaming

82
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:35,120
together and that allowed this whole

83
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,570
distributed network thing to happen and

84
00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:40,950
then we standardized things we

85
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:44,130
standardized with tcp/ip and computers

86
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:46,920
could talk to each other and eventually

87
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,830
they all merge together they form the

88
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:52,860
interconnected networks the internet big

89
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:56,750
story by itself and then we built

90
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:59,850
application protocols on top of this no

91
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:02,190
common things to enable us to do this

92
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:04,500
stuff that we do every day email and DNS

93
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:08,670
and HTTP and we had to figure out ways

94
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:11,820
for those to communicate so we had you

95
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:13,920
our alleys which allowed you no

96
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:17,100
standardized ways of finding things so

97
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:18,540
you might have you know whitehouse.gov

98
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:20,780
or

99
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:23,729
ultimate idiots at whitehouse.gov but it

100
00:04:23,729 --> 00:04:24,510
could be anything

101
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:32,600
on that and then finally HTML vague but

102
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:36,950
exciting as Tim berners-lee boss said

103
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:40,260
seriously understating the whole

104
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:43,350
foundation of our careers here in the

105
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:46,320
world and that but a world change in

106
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:51,390
this of it and I think we should stop

107
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:53,390
for a second and think about the web

108
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:58,650
about how amazingly strong it is and

109
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:02,310
it's strong because of that dullness we

110
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:04,500
mentioned because of all these dumb

111
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:08,350
technologies that have come together

112
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:15,300
especially HTML which is this simple

113
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:19,970
very simple declarative language and by

114
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:23,820
declarative well what do we mean by that

115
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:29,750
I guess you could say that's suggestive

116
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:34,170
HTML suggests to the browser what it

117
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:36,720
wants to happen it's all like hey could

118
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,300
you maybe do this for me and the browser

119
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:41,880
comes back with oh yeah now yes nicely

120
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:44,820
yeah maybe I could do that it's got a

121
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:45,990
little bit of flirting again it's a

122
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:49,010
little bit of suggestiveness

123
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:52,770
but this suggestiveness is what makes

124
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:56,900
the web and HTML incredibly robust

125
00:05:56,900 --> 00:06:00,600
because you can pull a page apart as

126
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:04,230
it's running you can go in that it's

127
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:05,730
like the Terminator man you just can't

128
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:07,560
stop it you can go in there and rip its

129
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:10,500
guts out you can remove 90% of the code

130
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:13,440
from page but the end of it you can

131
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,700
still click a button and proceed with it

132
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:21,450
and that robustness is why the web

133
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:26,340
dominates a stricter language would have

134
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:30,810
broken 100% it would have fallen over

135
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:33,630
it's so fragile what is shattered as

136
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:36,150
soon as it encountered a huge error like

137
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:36,850
90

138
00:06:36,850 --> 00:06:42,460
it's code but it's been removed and in

139
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:46,240
addition to that the web is well it's

140
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,420
unrestricted and in the early days

141
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:52,690
anyone can build a browser and anyone

142
00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:56,500
could get a browser for any machine or

143
00:06:56,500 --> 00:07:01,870
any operating system and that meant that

144
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:06,550
anyone could publish things and the

145
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:08,680
early web was weird

146
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:12,450
it was fantastic for that weirdness

147
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:15,400
people used to just get the brain dumps

148
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:18,100
onto HTML page and put it out there in

149
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:22,630
public they said declare their love for

150
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:27,940
things and people and even some famous

151
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:30,520
Souls you know got their early starts up

152
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:36,690
and they're on the early weird web but

153
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:40,710
unfortunately some darker times came

154
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:42,910
possibly more dark than I thought that

155
00:07:42,910 --> 00:07:46,040
given the contrast issues

156
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:50,890
what used to be free and weird suddenly

157
00:07:50,890 --> 00:07:54,180
became balkanized and commercialized and

158
00:07:54,180 --> 00:08:00,250
completely locked in I don't know if

159
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:02,650
anybody here is again blessed with the

160
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:04,750
age have been able to remember this

161
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:08,920
particular stuff the web at one point

162
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:12,220
got split between these two browsers and

163
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:14,740
devs effectively had to build two

164
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:17,890
versions of their sites in order to cope

165
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:23,320
with this and users how to like declare

166
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,390
loyalty to one particular browser and

167
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:28,870
stick with it it was a weird time of

168
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:33,400
just like frozen innovation and in fact

169
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:36,060
everything froze development froze

170
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:40,000
innovation stopped and resumed really

171
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,540
weird crappy time for a number of years

172
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:50,290
but history restarted from an unexpected

173
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:56,220
direction when the first iPhone appeared

174
00:08:56,220 --> 00:09:00,160
and while it wasn't the first smartphone

175
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,650
certainly it was certainly the first

176
00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:06,610
popular one and he gave us this huge

177
00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:11,830
enormous diversity lesson because we've

178
00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:13,840
been assuming up until that point that

179
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:16,840
our site had to work in you know one of

180
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:20,290
two browsers effectively and they

181
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:22,240
couldn't cope with this new diversity of

182
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:25,720
things and so we had to learn things

183
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:28,180
like responsive web design ether my

184
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:30,280
codes grades like synthesis of a few

185
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:34,240
simple dumb techniques again because we

186
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:38,680
didn't want to exclude people we didn't

187
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,930
want to stop people from using our

188
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:44,170
websites

189
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:46,880
and while I'm not an Apple over by any

190
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:47,600
means

191
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,970
despite laptop it was a gift to us

192
00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:54,680
these were really good times because we

193
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:57,110
were suddenly designing with all kinds

194
00:09:57,110 --> 00:10:01,130
of devices in mind it was the ultimate

195
00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:09,620
of the web but are we starting this

196
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:15,020
cycle again maybe with different aspects

197
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:19,850
different technology reasons but with

198
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:21,640
the same result

199
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:25,160
which is that suddenly we're starting to

200
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:27,320
exclude people from the web

201
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:33,680
again we suddenly got websites that

202
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:37,730
require megabytes to download just like

203
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:41,240
how we talked about earlier this is this

204
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,610
is incredible

205
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:46,220
basic information science with text

206
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:52,140
content not YouTube not videos

207
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:55,340
accessibility who is that it's still a

208
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:58,790
complete unknown to most people it's

209
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:02,510
somehow not a core requirement of being

210
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:06,560
a front-end developer somehow it doesn't

211
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:11,240
appear on on our job applications and it

212
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:16,450
should be one of the core skills and

213
00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:18,760
this is not going to be popular

214
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:22,880
JavaScript as a default delivery

215
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:30,420
mechanism just to deliver HTML

216
00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:32,980
now I'm going to take a moment to just

217
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:35,320
ran to you a little bit because here to

218
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:40,440
me this feels like building a Boeing 747

219
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:43,750
to commute to work you know build their

220
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:46,540
plane up take it up into the sky land

221
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:49,680
it's two kilometers away which is

222
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,030
technically amazing and I've got such

223
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:53,980
awe and love with you for you for doing

224
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:56,230
that but what didn't you have been

225
00:11:56,230 --> 00:12:00,970
better getting a bicycle you know we

226
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:02,920
should have this layered approach to

227
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:08,050
things it's HTML CSS JavaScript and it's

228
00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:12,130
led to this weird situation now West

229
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:16,300
sites are no longer robust like we saw

230
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:18,430
earlier it used to be the case where all

231
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:20,710
sites could just run no matter if

232
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:24,550
they're in it to a website but now sites

233
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:28,420
die easily they're fragile and they

234
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:32,490
shatter things like Network conditions

235
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:36,580
user choices blocked JavaScript can all

236
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:42,040
destroy a site

237
00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:45,360
and maybe as a response to this we've

238
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,770
got this whole new focus

239
00:12:46,770 --> 00:12:50,220
we know talk about tooling and packaging

240
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:54,150
and ecosystem stuff which don't get me

241
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:55,890
wrong I mean I use this every day I use

242
00:12:55,890 --> 00:12:58,440
webpack I use NPM I write modular

243
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:02,480
JavaScript I get why we need this stuff

244
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:06,780
but the focus has become on developer

245
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:11,580
happiness on us having fun and the word

246
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:14,940
uses despite these talks that we've had

247
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:18,120
today would have been superb the word

248
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:20,790
uses from the general consensus in the

249
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:26,310
industry has disappeared and we're back

250
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:28,680
to building sites that are not for

251
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:33,270
everybody we're starting to explicitly

252
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:38,510
say my site is not for some users

253
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:43,940
because we won't have our fun

254
00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:48,269
so maybe it's time to stop this kind of

255
00:13:48,269 --> 00:13:52,320
cycle which is a common one in tech

256
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:56,160
let's face it I mean remember when we

257
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:59,459
reinvented IRC just so we could have gif

258
00:13:59,459 --> 00:14:04,889
ease in there or we reinvented RSS and

259
00:14:04,889 --> 00:14:09,819
called it's accelerated mobile pages

260
00:14:09,829 --> 00:14:12,779
we're afraid to build on top of things

261
00:14:12,779 --> 00:14:17,579
now we just want to disrupt it's about

262
00:14:17,579 --> 00:14:20,310
the prestige and the money and the bling

263
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:25,600
and it's not about the people anymore

264
00:14:25,610 --> 00:14:28,529
but you know maybe that's just life

265
00:14:28,529 --> 00:14:30,899
under late-stage capitalism and we

266
00:14:30,899 --> 00:14:36,779
should just accept that well maybe not

267
00:14:36,779 --> 00:14:40,260
maybe that's a bit negative there are

268
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:42,959
things that we can actually do before

269
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:47,250
it's too late so what can we do to break

270
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:50,640
break this cycle how can we make the web

271
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:56,070
better again well firstly we can learn

272
00:14:56,070 --> 00:14:59,660
the basics and I don't mean of

273
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:03,449
technology here I mean about people

274
00:15:03,449 --> 00:15:08,370
I mean about human things such as

275
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:11,060
empathy

276
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:13,100
and we've got this assumption that

277
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:16,330
empathy is some kind of innate traits

278
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:18,950
that you're either born with it or

279
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:22,610
you're not born with it and that is such

280
00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:23,740
a lie

281
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:28,690
empathy is a muscle it's a learner will

282
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:32,810
that you can reinforce every day just by

283
00:15:32,810 --> 00:15:38,270
practicing it and practicing this

284
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:41,060
empathy allows us to be more aware of

285
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:44,270
other people's needs become aware that

286
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:47,840
not everyone is like us here like us

287
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:52,990
here in this room right now because

288
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:56,840
we're genuinely quite rich people in

289
00:15:56,840 --> 00:16:00,170
this industry I know we don't always

290
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:02,630
feel like it right now I literally

291
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:04,670
stopped paying off my student loans last

292
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:08,390
year I feel you on this but in the

293
00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:09,860
assumptions that we make about things

294
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:12,740
for example how many people here of

295
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:13,340
Gotland

296
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:14,930
the latest technology I've got the

297
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:17,840
latest MacBook how many people here have

298
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:21,560
got the latest iPhone X on order for

299
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:26,120
next month not everyone else is like

300
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:28,550
this the rest of the world doesn't think

301
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:34,390
in these ways and yet we do and in fact

302
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:37,580
we kind of make these idiots into the

303
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:41,300
norm for things when they're not and

304
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:45,830
we've got to be better than that so what

305
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:50,270
else can we consider we can consider the

306
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:52,520
fact that not everyone is well connected

307
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:55,410
in the world

308
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:57,910
and I think sometimes we consider a poor

309
00:16:57,910 --> 00:16:59,920
connection to be something like this

310
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:02,800
they must be autumns poor person in a

311
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,230
hut somewhere you know you know there's

312
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:08,290
poor poor people which is a bit of a

313
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:10,600
weird racist thing because the actual

314
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:15,940
reality is this I saw statistic the

315
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:19,000
other day there was something like 30%

316
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,839
of rural America is still on dial-up

317
00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:28,000
internet 56 kilobits per second is a

318
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,700
standard for huge numbers of people in

319
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:35,380
the richest country on the planet and

320
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:36,820
again we had Harry talking about this

321
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:39,190
earlier what the realities of the

322
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:41,170
internet connection are for people

323
00:17:41,170 --> 00:17:46,390
around the planet another step in

324
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:46,780
empathy

325
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:49,870
you know maybe we've got to consider

326
00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:54,160
that not everybody is able but it in

327
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:57,610
fact 12% of all people have a disability

328
00:17:57,610 --> 00:18:01,540
of some form or another and that's not

329
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:03,310
just things like wheelchairs and

330
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:04,930
blindness you know the stereotypes that

331
00:18:04,930 --> 00:18:08,310
we think of now she covers huge areas

332
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:12,670
stuff like color blindness arthritis the

333
00:18:12,670 --> 00:18:16,960
use of crutches we've just got to keep

334
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:20,500
these things in mind constantly because

335
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:23,140
our job at the end of the day is about

336
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:27,900
building things for other people it's

337
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:32,590
fundamentally about empathy that is the

338
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:37,000
core of our job

339
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:39,350
okay so maybe you've listened to these

340
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:41,440
things and maybe you take them on board

341
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:45,260
so how can you start using them in the

342
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:45,940
real world

343
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:51,419
what does building with empathy mean

344
00:18:51,429 --> 00:18:54,919
well it's this doorknobs

345
00:18:54,919 --> 00:18:59,600
I know doorknob calm Budapest now both

346
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,690
of these doorknobs are absolutely lovely

347
00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:05,299
I'm sure we can all agree in that we

348
00:19:05,299 --> 00:19:06,650
don't discriminate against doorknobs

349
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:11,059
here but one of these works for

350
00:19:11,059 --> 00:19:14,390
everybody on the planet while the other

351
00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:19,070
one excludes people excludes people who

352
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:21,530
might have arthritis who might be

353
00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:27,450
amputees or who might be using crutches

354
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:30,470
and if we start thinking in this kind of

355
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:33,679
mindset just with that simple example we

356
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:36,200
start helping more people again as we

357
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:38,929
heard earlier we start helping things

358
00:19:38,929 --> 00:19:42,590
other than just the obvious case so

359
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:45,080
designing a door handle in a proper way

360
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:46,970
you know actually helps people who were

361
00:19:46,970 --> 00:19:49,520
carrying large loads were carrying bags

362
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:57,780
who've got a baby in their arms

363
00:19:57,790 --> 00:19:59,770
and you can take this empathy into the

364
00:19:59,770 --> 00:20:02,530
workplace and try to get it in there

365
00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:06,010
from the beginning by progressively

366
00:20:06,010 --> 00:20:09,670
designing and that means starting right

367
00:20:09,670 --> 00:20:13,450
at the very start sketching things with

368
00:20:13,450 --> 00:20:16,960
UX people testing ideas with people

369
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:20,380
before you ever touch code Before we

370
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:22,510
jump in with the latest exciting

371
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:25,150
technology that we've heard about just

372
00:20:25,150 --> 00:20:27,520
stop and think about how a person will

373
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:34,390
use it and then then you can get those

374
00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:41,760
ideas into HTML and I do mean just HTML

375
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:44,620
you know the traditional thing with

376
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:50,710
forms and hate wands and no styling test

377
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:55,030
if this kind of stuff works with real

378
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:59,950
people again because this hTML is going

379
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:06,230
to be the foundation of your website

380
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:10,230
and why should you do it like this well

381
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:11,960
if you build it this way from the start

382
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:14,610
you're checking the basics from the

383
00:21:14,610 --> 00:21:19,650
start and because HTML is super generous

384
00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:22,860
it gives you so much accessibility stuff

385
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:25,290
for free without you even having to

386
00:21:25,290 --> 00:21:26,990
think about it

387
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:29,910
if you do things this way think about

388
00:21:29,910 --> 00:21:33,420
basic HTML first you're going to have

389
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:37,740
something that works from the start and

390
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:39,990
as bonus you can be seen how a screen

391
00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:42,270
reader might see it or how someone using

392
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:46,700
a text mode browser might see it and

393
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:49,920
then once you've got a working hate

394
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:53,930
smile foundation then you can mold it up

395
00:21:53,930 --> 00:21:57,030
okay get some ghost music soundtrack on

396
00:21:57,030 --> 00:21:59,840
stop molding it into a beautiful design

397
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:05,810
forming the HTML into components and

398
00:22:05,810 --> 00:22:09,210
then only then at that point do you add

399
00:22:09,210 --> 00:22:12,210
the fancy things do you put the

400
00:22:12,210 --> 00:22:15,690
JavaScript on top upgrade those boring

401
00:22:15,690 --> 00:22:17,880
forms that we talked about so that they

402
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:20,970
I don't know connect to rest api's so

403
00:22:20,970 --> 00:22:23,300
the pagination now works without a page

404
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:29,040
reloading I know that's a bit abstract

405
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:31,560
so let's give you a practical example of

406
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:34,860
this now this is gonna be something that

407
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:36,930
I've been working on for the last few

408
00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:39,030
weeks you know as part of a small side

409
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:42,510
project then we've got our workplace and

410
00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:44,130
we start out in exactly that way we

411
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:48,750
talked about starting with HTML and then

412
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:51,830
we add the most simple style sheet to it

413
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:53,910
something there's barely more than

414
00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:57,900
styled hate smell and we make sure that

415
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:01,920
that works everywhere and it does work

416
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:04,230
everywhere just buying by nature of what

417
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:07,440
it is this is fundamentally workable on

418
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:11,760
every device iPhone desktop whatever it

419
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,760
is

420
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:17,030
and then we do a test against a fancy

421
00:23:17,030 --> 00:23:19,850
media query wonder is being crafted to

422
00:23:19,850 --> 00:23:23,180
catch the latest browsers and then those

423
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:27,790
browsers we send an upgraded experience

424
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:31,310
we send him and a full working

425
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:35,030
stylesheet and in fact this is a reduce

426
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:36,920
form of the BBC's cutting the mustard

427
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:40,880
technique and yes we've deliberately

428
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:44,330
chosen to exclude some browsers from

429
00:23:44,330 --> 00:23:49,420
having a full enhanced experience here

430
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:52,460
because we know even if those older

431
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:55,550
browsers get that reduced functionality

432
00:23:55,550 --> 00:23:59,480
that reduced styling more it will still

433
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:04,730
work for them and then like I said

434
00:24:04,730 --> 00:24:07,760
before only then do we load in fancy

435
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:11,030
JavaScript and we touched up by a match

436
00:24:11,030 --> 00:24:13,700
media event because we check to see if

437
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:16,640
the CSS is loaded and if the CSS is

438
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:19,370
loaded that we know we can it's advanced

439
00:24:19,370 --> 00:24:21,710
browser we can attach javascript to it

440
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:24,410
and then we can do tabbing we can do

441
00:24:24,410 --> 00:24:28,850
animations we can do your drop down and

442
00:24:28,850 --> 00:24:31,640
we've got all this documented in an open

443
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:33,680
playbook that we maintain I'll post a

444
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:36,350
link to this afterwards on Twitter so

445
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:37,460
you can all take a look at this in more

446
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:43,670
detail and that ties the fundamentals of

447
00:24:43,670 --> 00:24:46,700
progressive enhancement a really simple

448
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:49,930
example but it's about making a site

449
00:24:49,930 --> 00:24:53,930
Universal from the start and only

450
00:24:53,930 --> 00:24:57,870
upgrading it when it becomes necessary

451
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:00,890
and doing something like that makes a

452
00:25:00,890 --> 00:25:05,150
site robust as hell again you can make

453
00:25:05,150 --> 00:25:08,120
it so that it doesn't fall over when one

454
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:12,070
aspect of it breaks

455
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:15,770
and in addition it's the ultimate in

456
00:25:15,770 --> 00:25:19,820
agile development because by doing

457
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:23,240
things this way you don't you don't

458
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:25,700
sketch something in sketch and then try

459
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:28,760
to code towards that as a final goal you

460
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:30,590
know you don't have this waterfall

461
00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:32,960
approach to things that is quite frankly

462
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:35,810
common in our industry right now no you

463
00:25:35,810 --> 00:25:39,830
do things a jille you build you test you

464
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:42,590
iterate you build you test again over

465
00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:44,930
and over making something gradually

466
00:25:44,930 --> 00:25:49,940
better as you go along and for people

467
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:52,010
like me who were fundamentally lazy this

468
00:25:52,010 --> 00:25:55,010
is amazing it means you only build what

469
00:25:55,010 --> 00:25:58,100
you need to you don't start on trying

470
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:01,100
the latest techniques you only add

471
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:03,790
advanced things as they are necessary

472
00:26:03,790 --> 00:26:06,950
this incredibly lean approach to things

473
00:26:06,950 --> 00:26:12,380
I think also fights FOMO

474
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:16,190
if if people don't know what FOMO is

475
00:26:16,190 --> 00:26:19,610
fear of missing out and again this is

476
00:26:19,610 --> 00:26:22,220
something that I think we all have we

477
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:24,020
all suffer from I know I certainly do I

478
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:25,550
hear about the latest techniques as I oh

479
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:27,490
my god I haven't learnt about that one

480
00:26:27,490 --> 00:26:30,770
we tend to get excited by the latest

481
00:26:30,770 --> 00:26:33,260
technologies and rather than asking

482
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:36,260
again does he benefit the users does

483
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:39,530
this make things better for them it

484
00:26:39,530 --> 00:26:41,780
stops us and puts a break on that

485
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:47,690
excitement because we do frankly tend to

486
00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:53,000
build too complex at the moment we're

487
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,700
trying to keep up collectively with

488
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:58,250
giant engineering companies that have

489
00:26:58,250 --> 00:27:00,500
tens of thousands of engineering staff

490
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:03,950
doing the latest things and we're all

491
00:27:03,950 --> 00:27:05,390
running behind trying to keep up with

492
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:07,790
them and thinking this is must be the

493
00:27:07,790 --> 00:27:12,500
best way of doing things when it isn't

494
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:15,230
necessarily maybe we could just start

495
00:27:15,230 --> 00:27:16,580
keeping things simple

496
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:20,880
a bit more

497
00:27:20,890 --> 00:27:23,419
and there are some limitations I will be

498
00:27:23,419 --> 00:27:26,630
the first to admit that it's absolutely

499
00:27:26,630 --> 00:27:27,679
amazing

500
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:29,990
but one thing progressive enhancement is

501
00:27:29,990 --> 00:27:32,720
still beats by easily by the client-side

502
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,340
JavaScript framework so right there

503
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:37,910
right now is state management absolutely

504
00:27:37,910 --> 00:27:42,049
state management is a big thing but I

505
00:27:42,049 --> 00:27:45,140
will still argue that it is only a

506
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:48,020
minority of sites that actually work

507
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:52,130
that way the high profile sites all rely

508
00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:55,100
on it but the average site that we are

509
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:58,190
producing does not need to jump into

510
00:27:58,190 --> 00:28:02,860
full state management immediately I

511
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:05,299
thought maybe we can work on that I

512
00:28:05,299 --> 00:28:06,740
actually think this is something that

513
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:09,049
will come in the future we'll have that

514
00:28:09,049 --> 00:28:12,380
merging of easy state management's and

515
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:14,840
progressive enhancement and that will be

516
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:20,360
incredible for the web at that point we

517
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:22,809
should remember what it excels and again

518
00:28:22,809 --> 00:28:25,850
doing things this way makes it robust

519
00:28:25,850 --> 00:28:29,480
and makes it Universal makes it work for

520
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:33,200
everybody it will always work in the

521
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:36,049
worst conditions when this broken

522
00:28:36,049 --> 00:28:38,540
JavaScript when there's bad Network

523
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:40,549
conditions when people deliberately

524
00:28:40,549 --> 00:28:43,059
disable things and believe me they do

525
00:28:43,059 --> 00:28:45,890
deliberately disable things now Josh

526
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:48,290
Cribbs being turned off by people I know

527
00:28:48,290 --> 00:28:50,240
but simply because they want to avoid

528
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:53,360
the adverts and the huge number of

529
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:55,549
third-party downloads that come from

530
00:28:55,549 --> 00:29:00,080
those it's lightweight and it loves

531
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:05,390
people first anyway even if you don't do

532
00:29:05,390 --> 00:29:07,190
progressive enhancement there's still

533
00:29:07,190 --> 00:29:08,600
are those things that people have talked

534
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:11,419
about earlier in the day you can do

535
00:29:11,419 --> 00:29:14,390
stuff like turning on your in your dev

536
00:29:14,390 --> 00:29:17,830
tools turn on 3d performance turn on the

537
00:29:17,830 --> 00:29:21,799
CPU throttling start using the site like

538
00:29:21,799 --> 00:29:24,559
average people do out there in the real

539
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:27,020
world simulate those real-world

540
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:29,810
conditions

541
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:33,630
and if you can use real hardware because

542
00:29:33,630 --> 00:29:37,140
again as we've heard today your 3000

543
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:42,150
euro Mac is not anywhere near the

544
00:29:42,150 --> 00:29:44,370
performance of what a real-world person

545
00:29:44,370 --> 00:29:48,150
has it's vastly overpowered the new

546
00:29:48,150 --> 00:29:49,560
iPhone that people are going to have

547
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:52,380
next week is infinitely more powerful

548
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:54,270
than the average phone that people hold

549
00:29:54,270 --> 00:29:57,870
in their hands but because we use these

550
00:29:57,870 --> 00:30:00,780
every day we assume that everybody else

551
00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:06,720
uses them and they don't and again as we

552
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:09,540
said earlier if you can make this run on

553
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:12,450
a low powered device if your site runs

554
00:30:12,450 --> 00:30:15,150
on the lowest end of things it's going

555
00:30:15,150 --> 00:30:18,540
to be screamingly fast on the real high

556
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:23,520
powered devices and then in addition

557
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,200
just another one those little tasks you

558
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,090
can do you can turn on your screen

559
00:30:27,090 --> 00:30:29,670
reader and again if you're a stereotype

560
00:30:29,670 --> 00:30:31,710
for the developer which we all are you

561
00:30:31,710 --> 00:30:33,660
can just have to do on your Mac you just

562
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:35,760
have to go command f5 and you've

563
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:37,890
immediately got voiceover turned on and

564
00:30:37,890 --> 00:30:41,700
you can start testing these things you

565
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:43,530
can start navigating your site by sign

566
00:30:43,530 --> 00:30:45,780
and believe me this is so much fun when

567
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:47,310
you actually do it for the first time

568
00:30:47,310 --> 00:30:50,760
when you actually find out what a whole

569
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:54,840
new interface to use him websites and

570
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:56,460
there's a steep learning curve with it

571
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:58,220
don't get me wrong you have to learn a

572
00:30:58,220 --> 00:31:02,070
100 new key combinations but if we're a

573
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:03,870
group of people who can learn a pianist

574
00:31:03,870 --> 00:31:06,000
by hearts and all the different CSS

575
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,910
properties I'm confident we can learn

576
00:31:08,910 --> 00:31:13,160
that kind of thing for sure and

577
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:16,470
similarly start trying to navigate with

578
00:31:16,470 --> 00:31:19,890
your keyboard every day and this one is

579
00:31:19,890 --> 00:31:22,320
incredibly easy you just it's wonky just

580
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:25,230
time tab through everything start seeing

581
00:31:25,230 --> 00:31:27,200
where your website looks like with that

582
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,250
try and discover those little things

583
00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:31,020
that we saw earlier those little

584
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:33,630
ordering areas that can creep in so

585
00:31:33,630 --> 00:31:37,500
easily by going visual first you'll be

586
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:39,150
amazed at how much better you can make

587
00:31:39,150 --> 00:31:45,500
your site's straightaway

588
00:31:45,510 --> 00:31:48,880
be my he was said by the CEO somewhere

589
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:52,180
but these aren't my users I don't have

590
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:57,490
users like these poor users or disabled

591
00:31:57,490 --> 00:32:01,000
users and I will come back to you and

592
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:05,860
say you do have users like that you do

593
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:08,920
because you don't know a user situation

594
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:12,670
at any point you can't always assume

595
00:32:12,670 --> 00:32:16,480
they are in the best situation they

596
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:19,120
might be even your millionaire user your

597
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:21,520
high petrol user might have borrowed a

598
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:24,190
phone of somebody else they might be

599
00:32:24,190 --> 00:32:27,760
sitting a scaled down work computer they

600
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,890
could just be in a bad situation on

601
00:32:29,890 --> 00:32:35,210
holiday somewhere you cannot know this

602
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:38,770
and at the end of the day even those

603
00:32:38,770 --> 00:32:40,180
millionaires are going to have crappy

604
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:43,510
days so let's try and be kind to the

605
00:32:43,510 --> 00:32:50,740
poor old millionaires anyway the web

606
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:56,520
success is built on it being robust

607
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:59,350
being built on a robustness that works

608
00:32:59,350 --> 00:33:05,200
for anybody I know that people depend on

609
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:07,750
that robustness we have to keep

610
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:14,290
defending it we have to keep that beauty

611
00:33:14,290 --> 00:33:18,880
and that weirdness in the web because

612
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:21,970
the web is beautiful because of its

613
00:33:21,970 --> 00:33:25,510
diversity its diversity of people and

614
00:33:25,510 --> 00:33:31,930
its diversity of technology we are the

615
00:33:31,930 --> 00:33:35,770
enablers for that diversity so let's not

616
00:33:35,770 --> 00:33:39,400
make it about us and let's start making

617
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:42,400
it about the wonderful weirdness of the

618
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:45,510
web thank you
