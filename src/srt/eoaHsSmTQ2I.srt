1
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:17,520

so it's very nice you to come here and

2
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,369
after the bubble accident so all the

3
00:00:20,369 --> 00:00:23,100
rain will stay in the clouds from just a

4
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:25,500
little longer I'm going to talk about

5
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:28,020
Mona Lisa I've 30 minutes if you've any

6
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:30,270
questions just try to interrupt me I

7
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:32,580
hope to address them during the talk

8
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:37,050
unless I'm running out of time so I'm

9
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:39,360
told not to wander this up on this side

10
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,760
so probably going to stand here so this

11
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,440
is what I'm going to present the agenda

12
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,900
and presenting now a family Guatemala

13
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:49,379
loose Lisa who knows the painting well

14
00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:52,830
that's nice see a lot of hands I'm going

15
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:54,690
to tell you what mona lisa has to do

16
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:57,030
with the Traveling Salesman problem if

17
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:58,650
you don't know already what relation

18
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:01,430
with the P versus NP problem is and

19
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:04,049
welcome to the TSP art which is actually

20
00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:07,680
the main subject of this talk so the

21
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,640
Mona Lisa she's very well known I guess

22
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:14,820
everybody raised his or her hand but

23
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:19,200
she's a mysterious woman as you know

24
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,720
family known because of the enigmatic

25
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:24,600
smile and just chillin at the bottom

26
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:28,080
here and there's a lot of talk why she

27
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,660
smells like this there's even a

28
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:32,280
Wikipedia page with a lot of conspiracy

29
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,410
theories why she's smiling but I think I

30
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:37,080
know why she's smiling and let's do was

31
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:39,510
another detail of the painting namely

32
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:43,800
this road and why is this important well

33
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:47,310
if two little bit more about Mona Lisa

34
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:50,250
so who knows the details about the

35
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:53,850
person behind the portrait again this is

36
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:56,340
good because then I can tell you the

37
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:58,170
next slide the portraits of Lisa

38
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:00,690
Gherardini she lived the in the

39
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:03,409
Renaissance period in Italy and Florence

40
00:02:03,409 --> 00:02:06,510
vini was a very famous family although

41
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:11,370
at the age of of Lisa ash the the family

42
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:13,560
ran out of money so she married

43
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:17,330
Francisco del Giocondo which was a very

44
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:24,030
rich mostly rich silk merchant and when

45
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:25,850
I discovered when I was

46
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:29,570
looking up Mona Lisa I was very nice to

47
00:02:29,570 --> 00:02:31,850
see that she married out of love so that

48
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:36,380
appeals to my more romantic side but

49
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:37,850
what do you do if you are modestly

50
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:40,150
wealthy you have to look at the

51
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:42,830
expenditures you have so that's a that's

52
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:45,350
why the following problem comes in this

53
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:50,150
is Venice not Florence and let's say

54
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:54,110
that lisa has to go and talk to a lot of

55
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:57,380
merchants and salesmen and have to

56
00:02:57,380 --> 00:03:00,020
travel through vanish through all these

57
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:04,730
places somewhere are interested buyers

58
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:06,910
some are sellers of silk and the

59
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:09,530
question is if you have to visit all

60
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:11,780
these points what is the most efficient

61
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:14,990
route to to do this does anybody have a

62
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:21,830
clue nah me neither because that's

63
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:24,050
basically the main point of my article

64
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:27,950
of my my talk the task of finding for a

65
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:30,020
fine a number of points the best route

66
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:32,540
through the points at the shortest route

67
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:34,970
and that's actually they're called the

68
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:38,000
Traveling Salesman problem and this

69
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,280
problem is well known it's actually not

70
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,800
invented by monnalisa you can imagine

71
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,260
that it's used and at that time already

72
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:47,500
but it's firmly stated by a

73
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:50,960
mathematician an Alton and so this is a

74
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,760
little bit about my background on math

75
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:56,960
admission mathematician Lee train so the

76
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,930
question is how would you solve this and

77
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:01,550
I please raise your hand again like you

78
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:03,920
did when you was asked you know the

79
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,140
model exam how would you solve the

80
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:11,330
problem

81
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:13,750
yeah so that's it's a very good

82
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:16,480
suggestion trial combinations record the

83
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:20,470
shortest that's actually my answer as

84
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:24,370
well and interesting enough we as

85
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:27,330
developers we use mathematicians we as a

86
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:30,220
species don't know another better

87
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:32,380
solution in a particular sense of the

88
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:36,370
word so although this is a it's a good

89
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:38,200
algorithm to solve this problem or it is

90
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,760
an algorithm let's say let's say the

91
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:42,790
least of that it's not very nice to do

92
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:46,930
that and why not well let's imagine a

93
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:49,090
one-point city the problem will become

94
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:51,670
trivial there's only one possibility to

95
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:55,060
check and let's say that we can do that

96
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:58,570
in one second as the number of points we

97
00:04:58,570 --> 00:04:59,950
have to visit gross it's in the

98
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:02,860
left-hand column the possibilities grows

99
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:07,840
which is extended like very fast and the

100
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:11,260
duration I've made the second line

101
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:13,630
average yawn I hope not i'm going to

102
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:16,750
join your to death with this go but it's

103
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:21,010
amazingly how long how fast the problem

104
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:25,060
gets out of hand so for example with 33

105
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:26,800
cities in the tour if you have six

106
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,050
possibilities you can jaan at a time

107
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:32,020
average lee but if you take 15 towns i

108
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:33,760
can't even pronounce the number in

109
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:36,760
english but it's roughly three centuries

110
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,980
before you finished checking all the

111
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:43,150
possibilities so this this is an

112
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:46,540
inherent difficulty the problem with the

113
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:49,240
possibilities because we has the GS com

114
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:54,300
sure whether on nobody well there's a

115
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:57,669
there's a Rubik's Cube on on the front

116
00:05:57,669 --> 00:06:00,010
and the Rubik's Cube has a roughly the

117
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:02,590
same amount of possibilities as 15

118
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:03,840
points of the Traveling Salesman problem

119
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,580
but some people can solve it in 20

120
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:09,040
seconds so there's a really different

121
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:11,140
different problem than the Traveling

122
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:12,220
Salesman problem and that's a very

123
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:14,290
interesting property would you like to

124
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:18,040
talk now so word of the P equals NP

125
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:23,679
problem who knows what it means

126
00:06:23,689 --> 00:06:25,949
okay well that's interesting but that's

127
00:06:25,949 --> 00:06:28,529
precisely what I want to talk about so

128
00:06:28,529 --> 00:06:30,869
there's a famous unsolved problem in

129
00:06:30,869 --> 00:06:32,429
computer science famous for a lot of

130
00:06:32,429 --> 00:06:34,829
reasons just recently there was a movie

131
00:06:34,829 --> 00:06:38,239
about travelling salesman problem which

132
00:06:38,239 --> 00:06:41,159
had the subject this problem so that's

133
00:06:41,159 --> 00:06:43,679
why it's famous and there are popular

134
00:06:43,679 --> 00:06:45,449
reference to it but what does it mean

135
00:06:45,449 --> 00:06:48,899
actually well if you explain the two

136
00:06:48,899 --> 00:06:51,269
different peas in there so what does P

137
00:06:51,269 --> 00:06:53,969
mean so let's let's assume we have a

138
00:06:53,969 --> 00:06:55,979
function edition everybody knows how to

139
00:06:55,979 --> 00:06:58,259
do that and we're going to profile this

140
00:06:58,259 --> 00:07:01,649
method on the following data set so the

141
00:07:01,649 --> 00:07:05,269
profile method is not shown but it will

142
00:07:05,269 --> 00:07:07,949
run a few times of this function with

143
00:07:07,949 --> 00:07:10,289
the data two three and two so it will

144
00:07:10,289 --> 00:07:16,219
actually answer with five I guess so

145
00:07:16,219 --> 00:07:18,269
this is actually very interesting

146
00:07:18,269 --> 00:07:20,939
because what I was expecting and this is

147
00:07:20,939 --> 00:07:22,379
also nicely when you're preparing a talk

148
00:07:22,379 --> 00:07:25,739
is that the amount of time to perform

149
00:07:25,739 --> 00:07:27,959
these runs would grow it's actually not

150
00:07:27,959 --> 00:07:29,549
the case so we have to talk to somebody

151
00:07:29,549 --> 00:07:32,069
who knows the vm a lot better than me

152
00:07:32,069 --> 00:07:34,589
why this is but you can imagine if

153
00:07:34,589 --> 00:07:37,529
you're doing this calculation your hand

154
00:07:37,529 --> 00:07:40,199
shift for example let's take 31 and 27

155
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:45,029
you have to first add 127 to form 8 and

156
00:07:45,029 --> 00:07:49,860
then 3 to 2 245 so that's the answer and

157
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:51,659
if you do this for longer and longer

158
00:07:51,659 --> 00:07:53,369
numbers you have to take longer and

159
00:07:53,369 --> 00:07:56,939
longer time but it grows nicely and so

160
00:07:56,939 --> 00:08:00,449
the P stands here for polynomial so who

161
00:08:00,449 --> 00:08:03,929
knows what a polynomial is okay so

162
00:08:03,929 --> 00:08:06,539
polynomial informally means efficient

163
00:08:06,539 --> 00:08:09,149
it's not entirely the case but as the

164
00:08:09,149 --> 00:08:11,399
input grows so if you have larger and

165
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:14,279
larger number let's say we have a two

166
00:08:14,279 --> 00:08:17,609
two more two more digits then the then

167
00:08:17,609 --> 00:08:19,649
the run time of the algorithm doesn't

168
00:08:19,649 --> 00:08:22,319
grow very much actually so let's the

169
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:24,599
numbers grow twice as large the rent on

170
00:08:24,599 --> 00:08:26,539
will grow twice as large for this case

171
00:08:26,539 --> 00:08:29,129
so that's polynomial and generally this

172
00:08:29,129 --> 00:08:30,959
means a computer can solve this

173
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:34,529
efficiently and it's obvious occasional

174
00:08:34,529 --> 00:08:36,570
addition but there are other exam

175
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:40,440
balls so I just told you what P means so

176
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:45,340
does anybody want to guess what NP means

177
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:49,650
and so the obvious answer will be not

178
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:52,010
polynomial and that's not the case

179
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:56,100
unfortunately so we go to the next slide

180
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:58,860
what does NP me it means actually

181
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:01,490
non-data Mason deterministically

182
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:04,470
polynomial so at the end doesn't have a

183
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:07,170
relation to not p and i'm going to try

184
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:09,810
to explain what that means again we're

185
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:12,090
going to profile a function this time

186
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:15,140
there is a verification of factorization

187
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:19,470
so let's say somebody knows their

188
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:21,660
numbers very well and can call out the

189
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:25,230
factorization in prime factors of six so

190
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:26,850
does anybody know the factorization of

191
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:31,650
six yeah two times three to six so

192
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:33,660
you're going to be my Oracle which

193
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:36,570
whispers the answers in my ear because

194
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:39,000
when I'm verifying the result I don't

195
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,590
have to I don't have to do the hard work

196
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:43,830
i can do the easy work so it's somebody

197
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:45,930
asks what are the factors of 27 my

198
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:53,130
Oracle would answer three times three

199
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:55,020
times three and I can check in my head

200
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:56,430
three times three is nine times three

201
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:59,700
threes 27 yeah my oracle is very good so

202
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:03,540
this is this is the case with MP there

203
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:07,800
is a question what is the product of a

204
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,480
what's the factorization of certain

205
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,100
number and somebody can give me the

206
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:12,870
answer and only want to do is can I can

207
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:16,620
I check it is this clear until now

208
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:20,280
somebody's not in that's good okay so

209
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:24,210
informally NP means there's a problem

210
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:26,700
and I can check the answer in a

211
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:29,160
polynomial time so i can efficiently

212
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:32,280
check the answer so the famous question

213
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:35,280
is about is as follows now there's a

214
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:38,730
slide there is every problem that can be

215
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:40,890
verified efficiently like factorization

216
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:42,660
if you have an oracle you can check the

217
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:46,940
result is itself efficiently solvable

218
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:49,350
well who knows the answer to this

219
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:50,880
question

220
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:56,290
really there is no answer well that's

221
00:10:56,290 --> 00:10:58,120
that's that's more probably the best

222
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:00,610
answer today because nobody knows for

223
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:04,510
sure so this is actually an open problem

224
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:08,020
which is formed in the in the 60s when

225
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:09,610
computer science read took off and

226
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:12,580
nobody knows for sure it's actually one

227
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:13,990
of the most famous millennium prize

228
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:16,420
problems designing me know the Cray

229
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:20,100
Institute the clay Institute is a

230
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:21,970
mathematic institute founded by a

231
00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:23,920
billionaire which is money to spare and

232
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,990
he wants to sell seven problems the N

233
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:28,870
equals NP problem is one of them and if

234
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:30,700
you can solve it you will win a million

235
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:32,740
dollars so that's why it's interesting

236
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:35,170
to work on this problem and actually

237
00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:36,700
it's very interesting because the

238
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:39,190
Traveling Salesman problem is an example

239
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:41,760
that is known to be easily verifiable

240
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,080
because if someone gives you a route and

241
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:47,140
you can check what the length is but

242
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:50,950
it's not easy to do this actually not

243
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:55,930
sure what's happening now so if you are

244
00:11:55,930 --> 00:11:58,029
at work and you need to blow up your

245
00:11:58,029 --> 00:12:01,330
mind and you can work on the on for

246
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:02,950
example minesweeper because mine

247
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:04,779
sweepers also is a problem which is

248
00:12:04,779 --> 00:12:06,760
known to be np-complete and if you can

249
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,080
solve it efficiently you can win a

250
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:10,060
million dollar so cue balls walks in and

251
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:12,490
sees you solving minesweeper you can say

252
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:15,070
no no I'm doing research so that would

253
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:17,350
be an interesting problem to this day

254
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:19,270
the reason why another reason why it's

255
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:22,750
famous is because XKCD did a comic con

256
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:27,970
it so brute force solution the big o

257
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:30,730
notation says drin time something I

258
00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:32,890
would rather run time so and faculty

259
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:34,990
that's a long time you can do it a

260
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:36,580
little bit better but still it's a long

261
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:38,529
time so nobody knows an efficient

262
00:12:38,529 --> 00:12:43,240
algorithm to solve this problem so if

263
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:46,120
you're walking out this bowl you have to

264
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:48,130
remember one thing if you know something

265
00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:51,300
that falls in the class of NP complete

266
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:53,950
then you can do something interesting

267
00:12:53,950 --> 00:12:56,980
because there is no known efficient

268
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:58,270
algorithm yet so you have to do other

269
00:12:58,270 --> 00:12:59,680
things

270
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:03,070
so what does have to do with TSP arc

271
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:05,950
well a traveling salesman tour has an

272
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:08,290
interesting property so let's assume

273
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:11,080
that there's a route this is a small

274
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,610
part of the route through a lot of

275
00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:14,950
cities so for example the route shrubs

276
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:17,440
along the bubble enter there through the

277
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,870
left leg crosses over to the other

278
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:22,300
sitting down over the ground and up

279
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:26,050
again so this wouldn't be an optimal

280
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:28,390
solution because there's a shocker short

281
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:33,940
con does anybody sees it already well

282
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:37,120
there's some points oh sorry I have to

283
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:41,140
click this I guess so you can take a

284
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:43,149
shortcut so if you're entering from the

285
00:13:43,149 --> 00:13:46,000
upper left instead of going down the

286
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,459
other side you can go straight down and

287
00:13:48,459 --> 00:13:50,980
this is actually shorter because you

288
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:53,589
don't have to travel this lag and this

289
00:13:53,589 --> 00:13:55,420
lag so this is it shorter there and it's

290
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:57,910
shorter so you have a smaller route so

291
00:13:57,910 --> 00:13:59,890
this is an interesting problem in any

292
00:13:59,890 --> 00:14:01,270
rendition of a traveling salesman

293
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:03,720
problem you will never find crosses and

294
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:07,920
this is a nice aesthetic property that

295
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:11,650
you actually can fill out a form it

296
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:14,080
never touches the self you can trace it

297
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,820
with one pen without lifting your hand

298
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:19,750
so this is a very arty and aspect of the

299
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:21,700
of a root this is a traveling that

300
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:23,940
solves the Traveling Salesman instance

301
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:27,430
so how can we use it to render the Mona

302
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:31,810
Lisa well first if to stipple it's

303
00:14:31,810 --> 00:14:33,880
actually a technical term I guess the

304
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:36,279
Mona Lisa and unfortunately I try this

305
00:14:36,279 --> 00:14:38,200
out with my browser and because I wanted

306
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,660
to do this presentation my browser and

307
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:44,529
it is a hard problem to stipple a an

308
00:14:44,529 --> 00:14:46,810
image so i could only use a thousand

309
00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:50,050
points and then that this is a an

310
00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:52,900
example which you didn't use which isn't

311
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:55,660
formed in the browser and then you can

312
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:58,600
all see the dis isn't an optimal tour

313
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:02,050
because there are crosses here so it's a

314
00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:03,820
bit of a shame then this is an

315
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:05,050
indication that the Traveling Salesman

316
00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:07,510
problem is a hard problem to solve but

317
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:09,790
if you take this offline and invest more

318
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:12,670
time because I tried it with 10,000

319
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:13,329
points and it

320
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:16,449
just freezes my browser so i took this

321
00:15:16,449 --> 00:15:19,179
offline and this is actually an example

322
00:15:19,179 --> 00:15:21,279
of rendition of the Mona Lisa solved as

323
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:23,709
a traveling salesman problem and painted

324
00:15:23,709 --> 00:15:25,989
the tour and I think this is a very nice

325
00:15:25,989 --> 00:15:29,499
example of how fundamental research in

326
00:15:29,499 --> 00:15:30,999
mathematics and computer science

327
00:15:30,999 --> 00:15:34,059
combined with art can form beautiful

328
00:15:34,059 --> 00:15:38,829
pictures so is this clear what I'm

329
00:15:38,829 --> 00:15:42,610
talking about great there's a question

330
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:48,819
or okay the question was what points are

331
00:15:48,819 --> 00:15:51,970
you visiting the picture so first of all

332
00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:54,759
you take an image and you make a

333
00:15:54,759 --> 00:15:57,069
black-and-white version of it and then

334
00:15:57,069 --> 00:15:59,679
probably you just the brightness of it

335
00:15:59,679 --> 00:16:02,920
and you throw a lot of points at the

336
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:07,299
image and you form the image by the

337
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:09,160
darker regions the the image will clump

338
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,299
to get of the dots will clump together

339
00:16:10,299 --> 00:16:12,910
and then the writer in regions the image

340
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:17,129
are or sparser so actually these this

341
00:16:17,129 --> 00:16:20,259
this makes a rendition of the image just

342
00:16:20,259 --> 00:16:23,169
like that the last slide the previous

343
00:16:23,169 --> 00:16:25,629
slide so this you can see the Mona Lisa

344
00:16:25,629 --> 00:16:27,610
in here and if if you have more points

345
00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:29,589
the more points will grow together to

346
00:16:29,589 --> 00:16:31,269
form darker regions so these points

347
00:16:31,269 --> 00:16:32,799
actually are used to solve the Traveling

348
00:16:32,799 --> 00:16:34,809
Salesman problem this is the answer your

349
00:16:34,809 --> 00:16:44,280
question great this one

350
00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:49,400
so the so the mansion is this isn't an

351
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,620
optimal solution this probably isn't the

352
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:54,950
optimal one that's correct because this

353
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:58,010
is actually up on a website to try out

354
00:16:58,010 --> 00:17:01,400
your heart problems and it's solved

355
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:02,780
because there's no crossings you can see

356
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:06,530
that but a problem so you don't know

357
00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:09,110
your goes it so hard to do correctly

358
00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:10,970
answer the question is this the optimal

359
00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:13,610
tour it probably isn't this one that's

360
00:17:13,610 --> 00:17:18,330
correct it's not optimal other questions

361
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:20,860
because it's time for questions now so

362
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:23,360
will be nice so if you don't have

363
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:25,340
questions I have a question for you so

364
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:28,460
this is a look probably not going to see

365
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:31,460
the result of this but um I had a small

366
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:32,840
daughter she's a year and a half and

367
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:35,870
she's great and although I don't want to

368
00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:37,400
push her into a technical job it would

369
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,230
be great if she wanted to pursue that

370
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:43,430
and if you're a female technical person

371
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:45,710
I will ask you to go to this website and

372
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:48,260
give a write a letter to Sophie which is

373
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:49,640
a year and a half with some advice

374
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:52,580
because I think it's very hard for women

375
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:55,370
in this society with a lot of men in the

376
00:17:55,370 --> 00:17:57,770
technical side to become a technical

377
00:17:57,770 --> 00:18:01,370
person and work on that so this this

378
00:18:01,370 --> 00:18:04,790
repository would be my present for 12

379
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:06,410
birthday that if she wants to be a

380
00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:08,870
technical leader in this field that she

381
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:10,490
has some advice from for female role

382
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:12,890
models so if you take the time if you

383
00:18:12,890 --> 00:18:21,650
know a female role model so that's

384
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:22,970
basically it are there any more

385
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:29,210
questions for done don't go all right
