2
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:18,900
while I having a clapping mood can we

3
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:20,100
give a round of applause for the

4
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:21,900
organizers in the MC MCS because they

5
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:23,550
were not supposed to be doing that and

6
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:25,410
they were amazing and it's the end of

7
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:32,130
the day so super Hardy one thank you so

8
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:33,390
I'm so very excited about this talk and

9
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:34,800
how the schedule worked out because we

10
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,360
started with her arts in the morning and

11
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:37,980
we're gonna end with our night so it's

12
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:41,040
sort of like bookcase took the we booked

13
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,450
he's JavaScript with art and I think

14
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:44,910
that's really exciting I'm Monica

15
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:46,500
I'm not Waldorf on Twitter in internet

16
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:49,410
places that is my cat I do like cats I'm

17
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:51,329
an engineer at Google on a team called

18
00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:53,309
magenta in Google brain so I work with a

19
00:00:53,309 --> 00:00:55,170
whole bunch of researchers with machine

20
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:56,190
learning and I'm gonna tell you a little

21
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:57,960
bit about that in a little bit because

22
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:00,629
first I'm gonna talk to you about my

23
00:01:00,629 --> 00:01:03,449
favorite topping in the world myself if

24
00:01:03,449 --> 00:01:05,220
you've ever heard about me it's probably

25
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:06,330
because I made something really dumb and

26
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:08,340
I put it on the internet and you played

27
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:10,260
with it because that's what I really

28
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:12,210
like doing I really like building silly

29
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:14,610
things and I kept calling them silly for

30
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:16,500
the blast like three or four years and I

31
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:18,990
realized it's not entirely clear what I

32
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:21,150
mean by silly because - you silly means

33
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:23,040
something else probably it might mean

34
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,110
that the thing that I make aren't

35
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:27,420
serious or aren't important I don't know

36
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:28,890
or I don't care about them and that's

37
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:30,780
not true everything that I make is like

38
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:32,820
my little darling I put a lot of time in

39
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:34,229
them sometimes it take me like six

40
00:01:34,229 --> 00:01:36,180
months I love all of them whenever I put

41
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:38,460
them out there it stresses me out like

42
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:39,659
every good artist gives me anxiety

43
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:40,950
because you're gonna look at it and

44
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:43,920
judge it but silliness to me implies

45
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,259
that you can take it light heartedly you

46
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:48,600
could call it art but I don't art is the

47
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,100
word that I struggle with because I feel

48
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:51,689
like a society we sort of ruined the

49
00:01:51,689 --> 00:01:53,909
word art when we refer to something as

50
00:01:53,909 --> 00:01:55,020
art we have to judge it

51
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:56,430
everybody's been taught to like a look

52
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:57,930
at a painting and be like I couldn't

53
00:01:57,930 --> 00:01:59,040
make that in my living room

54
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,649
is it really art and then you don't

55
00:02:01,649 --> 00:02:03,450
enjoy it you like put on your judging

56
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:05,399
hat and you start hating on it and I

57
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:06,159
don't

58
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:07,390
want to be on the receiving end of that

59
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:09,729
and in particular I just want you to

60
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:11,290
have fun with them so this is why I call

61
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:12,880
them silly they're not art they're just

62
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,519
silly things that he can interact with

63
00:02:14,519 --> 00:02:16,890
these are the kind of things that I make

64
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:20,050
this is called MIDI 32,000 and it

65
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:21,910
literally build cities out of rock and

66
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:24,160
roll if you think about a MIDI file

67
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,840
which is this abstract representation

68
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,959
for music MIDI files have different

69
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:30,670
instruments which you can think about

70
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:32,590
them as like rows of buildings like in

71
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:35,290
different places in your city and at

72
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:37,300
every point in time you play a note on

73
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:39,730
one of these instruments and the notes

74
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:41,319
are represented by pitches so at a point

75
00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:43,120
in time you basically have a pitch which

76
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,560
is like the height of the building and

77
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,780
its length it's a duration so this is

78
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:48,489
how MIDI cities actually look like

79
00:02:48,489 --> 00:02:51,069
cities MIDI cities got MIDI music

80
00:02:51,069 --> 00:02:52,630
actually looks like cities and of course

81
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:54,790
you can play them and if the sound gods

82
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:58,260
work with us it should sound like this

83
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:04,539
[Music]

84
00:03:04,549 --> 00:03:07,140
the great thing about this is that once

85
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:08,700
you understand that's what MIDI is like

86
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:10,470
you can start playing around with this

87
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:12,209
file you can throw away some of the rows

88
00:03:12,209 --> 00:03:14,069
of the buildings you can increase the

89
00:03:14,069 --> 00:03:15,810
density or decrease it between these

90
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:25,080
buildings and that makes a new song

91
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:32,770
[Music]

92
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:38,400
it's not a good song but that's fine not

93
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,440
all the music that we make is good to

94
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,880
look at a lot of radio stations out

95
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:44,040
there and we make a lot of garbage why

96
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:46,440
not make garbage with JavaScript why why

97
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,510
is that stopping us and I really like

98
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:49,830
this project it's my favorite thing that

99
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:51,210
I've ever made because it's not just

100
00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:53,880
visual it's a really weird and possibly

101
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,710
useless music instrument that you can

102
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:58,380
play with and I like that it's silly

103
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:01,110
it's like the definition of my life um

104
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:03,480
the thing about making things I make

105
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,130
them because I like it but I make them

106
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:06,750
because making things is objectively

107
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:08,880
good there's a whole bunch of like

108
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:11,070
science research that shows that making

109
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:13,290
art actually helps you decrease your

110
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:15,030
cortisol levels it actually decreases

111
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:17,250
your stress and your anxiety if you

112
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:19,020
doodle while learning concepts you form

113
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:20,540
like different connections in the brain

114
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:23,100
and you learn things differently and it

115
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:24,540
helps you like reason through problems

116
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:27,060
making things is objectively good so I

117
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:28,230
make these things because it's

118
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:29,730
objectively good for me it's how I have

119
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:32,280
fun but in particular I make them so

120
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:34,020
that you can also make silly things with

121
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:35,460
me the things that I built aren't like

122
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:38,130
static art that you go and look at with

123
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:39,510
your eyeballs I make things where you

124
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:41,010
can click on them and you can make music

125
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:43,170
with them that demo that I showed you is

126
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:45,120
I'm glitch you can upload your own MIDI

127
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,410
files you can play with them you can

128
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:47,460
download them you can put them on

129
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:50,040
soundcloud and call it your new album do

130
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,990
whatever you want with them and these

131
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:53,100
are the kind of things that I like I

132
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:55,230
want to be able to in some way help you

133
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:56,820
with your creative process whether you

134
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:58,650
think you have won or not and sort of

135
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:00,540
extended and made it make a delightful

136
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:02,880
experience out of it and that's what

137
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,530
I've started calling generative delight

138
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:05,850
I used to call a generative art but

139
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:07,380
that's a term that already exists and

140
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:08,910
it's well defined and I kept like

141
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:10,260
 around with the definition so I

142
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:12,900
around with the definition so I
stopped doing that and to me generative

143
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:14,910
delight is this idea that I put a bunch

144
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:16,560
of code out there and then you put a

145
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,030
little bit of your creative process in

146
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:20,340
it and then I throw in like a randomness

147
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:22,500
in the output and what we get out of it

148
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,780
is something that hopefully is you know

149
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:27,180
generated and also delightful generative

150
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:29,580
delight the first thing that I did are

151
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:31,080
on this topic I've been like working in

152
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,760
this area for it and I say working very

153
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,740
very broadly because everything I make

154
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:36,740
is ridiculous but

155
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:38,690
for three or four years and it's like

156
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:40,490
been getting better and worse at times

157
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:41,569
the first thing that I ever made was

158
00:05:41,569 --> 00:05:44,330
emoji late which is a great and fun and

159
00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:45,500
useless app where you upload an image

160
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:47,539
and it gets pixelated and it replaces

161
00:05:47,539 --> 00:05:50,900
every pixel with an emoji excellent why

162
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:52,639
wouldn't you want that and I really like

163
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:55,460
it because obviously emoji but it's not

164
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:57,889
exactly a successful project for that

165
00:05:57,889 --> 00:06:00,740
generally D'Lite idea because your

166
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:02,539
creative expression isn't really in

167
00:06:02,539 --> 00:06:04,460
there like sure you pick what image

168
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:06,289
you're uploading but you can't really

169
00:06:06,289 --> 00:06:07,940
control what emoji comes out of it it's

170
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:09,349
not something that I built in its like

171
00:06:09,349 --> 00:06:11,000
picks the emoji that's closest to the

172
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,979
color of that pixel if you're having a

173
00:06:12,979 --> 00:06:14,240
bad day and you don't want to see any

174
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,460
like people in it tough luck it module

175
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:18,620
eight doesn't care the other part that I

176
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:20,870
really did not like about this is that

177
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:24,050
that random delight isn't in there once

178
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,550
you look at this screen and I told you

179
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:27,560
what emoji lead does you know exactly

180
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,090
well not exactly but like you have a

181
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:30,979
very good idea if you upload an image of

182
00:06:30,979 --> 00:06:33,289
a cat what that emoji lated cat is gonna

183
00:06:33,289 --> 00:06:35,060
look like you're gonna pixelate it in

184
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:36,080
your mind and you're gonna put a bunch

185
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,659
of like emoji of that color that do like

186
00:06:38,659 --> 00:06:40,759
that randomness isn't really there it's

187
00:06:40,759 --> 00:06:43,789
like fairly deterministic so in order to

188
00:06:43,789 --> 00:06:45,020
fix this because I was sort of in like

189
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:47,330
this slump of not making the things that

190
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:50,180
I wanted to do I introduced rules and if

191
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:51,560
you talk to any artists out there rules

192
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,780
are like crucial to anybody producing

193
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:55,490
anything because if the world is

194
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:57,050
literally your oyster you're not gonna

195
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:58,370
be able to produce something that's very

196
00:06:58,370 --> 00:07:01,219
honed in and very specific and I find

197
00:07:01,219 --> 00:07:04,280
the same thing happens in in any regular

198
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,990
in any like programming if you don't

199
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:07,669
have any rules the problem is really

200
00:07:07,669 --> 00:07:10,069
complicated you can like pick anything

201
00:07:10,069 --> 00:07:11,750
on like the server and the database and

202
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:13,819
your friend like a front-end framework

203
00:07:13,819 --> 00:07:15,289
and your whatever you want in the

204
00:07:15,289 --> 00:07:16,759
language and typescript in JavaScript

205
00:07:16,759 --> 00:07:18,199
and if you have to make all of these

206
00:07:18,199 --> 00:07:21,080
choices then you have less time to think

207
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:23,210
about well what should your application

208
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:24,680
do what is the experience you're trying

209
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:27,020
to communicate so the rules that I

210
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:28,370
introduced for basically that everything

211
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:30,590
that I made had to have emoji in it the

212
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:31,819
thing that it was gonna do is just

213
00:07:31,819 --> 00:07:33,800
display emoji somehow to the user and

214
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,780
then once I figured that one out the

215
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:37,880
thing that I had to focus on was well

216
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,110
what are we gonna do with this emoji

217
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:41,300
what is this creative expression that I

218
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:43,580
have to do with emoji now that I work on

219
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:44,960
a team that makes music pretty much

220
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,909
everything that I build touches mini

221
00:07:46,909 --> 00:07:48,830
files because that's the kind of thing

222
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:50,449
that that doesn't kind of rule that I

223
00:07:50,449 --> 00:07:52,580
introduced right now so the next thing

224
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:54,740
that I built in this project was called

225
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:56,900
emoji garden which generates a random

226
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:59,240
Garden of emoji things you can control

227
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,009
are the size of the garden and the

228
00:08:01,009 --> 00:08:03,259
density of snacks and visitors things

229
00:08:03,259 --> 00:08:06,110
you can't control anything else

230
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:08,960
this ended up being a surprisingly

231
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:12,080
wildly popular project for it like the

232
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,659
three hours that it took to make top

233
00:08:14,659 --> 00:08:16,969
highlight of my life Susan care the icon

234
00:08:16,969 --> 00:08:18,439
designer tweeted about it and then I

235
00:08:18,439 --> 00:08:20,300
died a little bit and I just went home

236
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:22,249
and celebrated Monica Lewinsky also

237
00:08:22,249 --> 00:08:24,020
tweeted about it so weird parts of my

238
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:27,499
world coming together but ironically

239
00:08:27,499 --> 00:08:29,689
this was also a failed project for me

240
00:08:29,689 --> 00:08:32,630
because it again did not have this

241
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:35,209
creative expression of yours in it you

242
00:08:35,209 --> 00:08:36,469
don't get to control anything you

243
00:08:36,469 --> 00:08:38,539
basically like roll the dice and it

244
00:08:38,539 --> 00:08:40,399
generates the garden for you maybe

245
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:41,990
carrots killed your family and you would

246
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:43,669
prefer no carrots in your garden tough

247
00:08:43,669 --> 00:08:45,380
luck would you garden really doesn't

248
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:49,160
care so this was a bit of a bummer cuz I

249
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,180
was like well I made something really

250
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:51,470
fun but I didn't make the thing that I

251
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:54,949
wanted to do again but it turned out to

252
00:08:54,949 --> 00:08:57,440
be an extremely successful generative

253
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,230
delight project because of the platform

254
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:01,370
that I built it on

255
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:05,029
I built it on glitch which is a platform

256
00:09:05,029 --> 00:09:06,800
that basically encourages collaboration

257
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,810
and remixes if you haven't seen it

258
00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:10,850
before this is it it's basically a

259
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:14,690
really fun and awesome code editor in

260
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:16,970
your browser it lets you like watch the

261
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:19,160
output whatever but in particular it

262
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,329
tries to like build this community

263
00:09:20,329 --> 00:09:23,779
around projects and it encourages remix

264
00:09:23,779 --> 00:09:26,029
think of people's projects so people so

265
00:09:26,029 --> 00:09:27,410
I tend to ride my projects in a way

266
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:29,120
where people can look at the code really

267
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,010
easily and like change it if they want

268
00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:34,069
to and to miri mixing is the premise of

269
00:09:34,069 --> 00:09:35,720
generative art you take something and

270
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,519
you regenerate it in a way that's like

271
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:39,860
makes sense to you so what what are not

272
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:41,209
happening with moji garden is that

273
00:09:41,209 --> 00:09:42,649
people took it and they started making

274
00:09:42,649 --> 00:09:44,839
their own garde gardens with it they

275
00:09:44,839 --> 00:09:47,209
remixed it into Hedgehog Gardens where

276
00:09:47,209 --> 00:09:48,889
only hedgehogs and no other animals were

277
00:09:48,889 --> 00:09:52,519
invited into really scary deserts that

278
00:09:52,519 --> 00:09:54,589
had scorpions and spiders and like a lot

279
00:09:54,589 --> 00:09:57,769
of fires because that was a snack they

280
00:09:57,769 --> 00:09:59,689
made into a sky because San Francisco

281
00:09:59,689 --> 00:10:01,010
has a lot of clouds and sometimes you

282
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:02,240
want to see a whole bunch of Suns in the

283
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:02,760
sky

284
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:06,690
and they made that they also made void

285
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:08,790
escapes which is my favorite I don't

286
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:11,339
know what it means and I love it

287
00:10:11,339 --> 00:10:15,329
it's like absolutely goth it's the gothy

288
00:10:15,329 --> 00:10:17,040
a-- sting i've seen done with javascript

289
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,260
sometimes you get like ominous eyeballs

290
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:22,050
and labels that say that the end is near

291
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:25,620
and clocks and i love it like if I could

292
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:27,449
just have this projected in my house all

293
00:10:27,449 --> 00:10:29,550
the time I would it's brilliant

294
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:33,180
Audrey made this fantastic so the

295
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:34,680
surprise here in this project wasn't

296
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:36,839
what I made which wasn't generative

297
00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:40,110
delight it was glitch the platform made

298
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:41,910
a generative because the thing about art

299
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:44,130
or really anything is that we don't make

300
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:46,350
it into a void we live in this weird

301
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:48,029
online world where everything is online

302
00:10:48,029 --> 00:10:49,620
happening all the time everywhere at

303
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:50,190
once

304
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:52,410
and the code that we use the devices

305
00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:55,500
that we distributed on the way the way

306
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,240
we put it out there all of these shape

307
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,070
the end result of what you're making and

308
00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:02,370
in here glitch shaped my project and it

309
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:03,810
was wonderful and it wouldn't have been

310
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:05,490
a successful project if glitch didn't

311
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:08,339
exist this isn't a weird thing like if

312
00:11:08,339 --> 00:11:10,829
you think about like an oil painter if

313
00:11:10,829 --> 00:11:12,930
you take away his oil they're their oil

314
00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:14,910
paints and you give them like thumbtacks

315
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:16,589
they're still going to produce art it's

316
00:11:16,589 --> 00:11:18,060
just going to be very different that

317
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:19,649
they were going that the thing that

318
00:11:19,649 --> 00:11:20,819
we're going to produce with oil

319
00:11:20,819 --> 00:11:22,579
paintings the same is gonna happen if

320
00:11:22,579 --> 00:11:26,819
you know I give you only a row of pixels

321
00:11:26,819 --> 00:11:28,680
and you have to produce art with it you

322
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,029
you will do it it's just gonna look

323
00:11:30,029 --> 00:11:32,250
different because everything that we

324
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:34,139
rely on is important for creativity and

325
00:11:34,139 --> 00:11:37,069
this is absolutely true of code as well

326
00:11:37,069 --> 00:11:40,019
the reason why emoji garden was so easy

327
00:11:40,019 --> 00:11:42,329
to remix is because of specific code

328
00:11:42,329 --> 00:11:44,310
decisions that I made and I'm gonna tell

329
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:46,130
you a little bit about this in a second

330
00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:48,930
because if you want to build visual

331
00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:50,730
things you should use visual libraries

332
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:52,050
and things that help you with it think

333
00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:53,519
of something like processing.js it's a

334
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:56,550
library that's literally built for you

335
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:58,860
know visual things so if you want to

336
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:00,120
build something visual processing will

337
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,800
help you with it if you want to build

338
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:02,850
something visually probably not gonna

339
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:05,459
reach for C++ unless you're you like

340
00:12:05,459 --> 00:12:08,790
pain and memory leaks that's not to say

341
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:10,620
that you can't produce art with C++ you

342
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:12,689
absolutely can like there is wonderful

343
00:12:12,689 --> 00:12:15,240
WebGL like WebGL got Open GL

344
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,980
shaders and stuff in games and you know

345
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:18,660
every video game in my opinion is art

346
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:21,029
it's just going to be harder because all

347
00:12:21,029 --> 00:12:23,069
of this time that you have to spend you

348
00:12:23,069 --> 00:12:25,470
know looking for pointers checking to

349
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:26,670
see if you've shot yourself in the foot

350
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:28,529
when you're managing your memory and all

351
00:12:28,529 --> 00:12:30,120
of that stuff that's less time that you

352
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:32,550
have to be creative and to paint things

353
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:34,050
on the screen which was the thing that

354
00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:35,310
you originally wanted to do you wanted

355
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:38,399
to like give the user some pixels so

356
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:40,260
emoji garden uses this library called

357
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,180
tracer ejs and tracer jeaious is built

358
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:45,630
by kate compton for procedure art and

359
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:48,449
it's a super simple library that i want

360
00:12:48,449 --> 00:12:49,529
to show you how it works because without

361
00:12:49,529 --> 00:12:50,819
it emoji garden wouldn't have been

362
00:12:50,819 --> 00:12:51,449
possible

363
00:12:51,449 --> 00:12:54,329
so in tracery jsut basically define your

364
00:12:54,329 --> 00:12:57,390
world as a grid of available tokens so

365
00:12:57,390 --> 00:12:59,010
here i think i picked em for either

366
00:12:59,010 --> 00:13:01,260
Monica or a model I don't remember it

367
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:03,480
was like late at night before visitor

368
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,010
and as for snacks and this is what

369
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:06,810
basically every garden looks like and I

370
00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:09,000
just randomize where these go I like

371
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,050
Rolla dice so I tell tracery that this

372
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:14,550
is my pattern and then I also tell it

373
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:16,620
what values you can put in so I give it

374
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:19,050
like a set of tokens the model can be

375
00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:21,689
cactuses and empty spaces the visitors

376
00:13:21,689 --> 00:13:23,189
can be like a mouse and a de life a

377
00:13:23,189 --> 00:13:25,829
little hot Hedgehog and then you paste

378
00:13:25,829 --> 00:13:27,630
you give these two things at tracery and

379
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:29,069
then tracery basically goes token for

380
00:13:29,069 --> 00:13:31,680
token and picks a random value from the

381
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,389
world that's all it does until it fills

382
00:13:33,389 --> 00:13:36,180
the entire grid this isn't hard like I

383
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:37,920
could have written this for loop I'm

384
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,019
competent at writing for loops I could

385
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:41,610
have done this it's like for loops and

386
00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:43,350
like JavaScript random numbers which

387
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:47,010
while weird are not that hard but I did

388
00:13:47,010 --> 00:13:49,470
and I used a library that was made to

389
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:51,630
help me with this because that means

390
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:53,550
that if somebody wanted to remix this

391
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:55,529
project they didn't have to know or read

392
00:13:55,529 --> 00:13:57,300
my for loops and like weird functions

393
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:59,040
that I declared all they had to do was

394
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,779
change the values of these tokens in the

395
00:14:00,779 --> 00:14:02,790
world just change those like that world

396
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:05,100
object and everything else would get

397
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:06,810
regenerated after they want like how

398
00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:08,939
they won and and this is why a lot of

399
00:14:08,939 --> 00:14:10,339
people that weren't even programmers

400
00:14:10,339 --> 00:14:12,480
managed to like take emoji guardant and

401
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,889
make their own gardens out of it and it

402
00:14:13,889 --> 00:14:15,480
was really great and that's what made a

403
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:18,480
you know delightful to think about

404
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,100
tracer is that it's a serious libraries

405
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:22,199
built by a serious person for serious

406
00:14:22,199 --> 00:14:24,809
things people use it to generate levels

407
00:14:24,809 --> 00:14:28,270
and video games or poems or stories or

408
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:29,770
anything that you want people also use

409
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:32,230
it to make a grid of ominous eyeballs

410
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:34,810
and doomsday clocks and I think that's a

411
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:36,610
really important thing because I think

412
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:38,950
about art is that you don't have to get

413
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:40,930
it somebody out there is going to get it

414
00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:42,370
and it's fine if you don't get it

415
00:14:42,370 --> 00:14:44,710
I don't get Roy Lichtenstein that

416
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:46,000
doesn't stop the MoMA from putting

417
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,180
pictures like his paintings in in their

418
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:52,540
museum so if we agree that making making

419
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:54,730
things is objectively good then we

420
00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:56,170
should also agree that helping people

421
00:14:56,170 --> 00:14:58,150
make these things is also objective

422
00:14:58,150 --> 00:14:59,260
really good and in particular it's

423
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:00,940
important so when I came to this

424
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:02,590
conclusion I was like oh this is

425
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:04,420
what I this is what I want to work like

426
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:05,650
this is what I want to get paid for

427
00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:09,400
helping people build sillier artsy

428
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,410
creative things and that's how I ended

429
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:12,970
up working on magenta which is the team

430
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:15,430
that I work on now so budget is a team

431
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:17,470
of researchers in a couple of Engineers

432
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:19,810
and a friend and engineering me and the

433
00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:21,070
researchers are super smart and

434
00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:22,540
brilliant and do machine learning

435
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:23,740
research where they create these like

436
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:25,300
brilliant models that are able to

437
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:28,120
generate music and then I come in and I

438
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:29,260
try to make a little JavaScript

439
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:30,850
delightful interaction with it so that

440
00:15:30,850 --> 00:15:32,230
other people take these models and

441
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:34,690
actually do useful things with them so

442
00:15:34,690 --> 00:15:36,310
the role of these team this team is to

443
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:38,470
explore the role of machine learning in

444
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:40,990
the creative process not replace the

445
00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:42,670
creative process but sort of interact

446
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:44,740
with it and see how we can help artists

447
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:48,070
musicians and creators use machine

448
00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:49,720
learning to like make awesome with

449
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:52,150
it because for better for worse machine

450
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:53,800
learning is like the hot new right

451
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,690
now is a word that's being thrown around

452
00:15:55,690 --> 00:15:58,090
everywhere from like selling you better

453
00:15:58,090 --> 00:16:00,700
ads to selling me shoes on Instagram to

454
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:02,950
cancer cells to self-driving cars to

455
00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:05,800
anything you want so why shouldn't it

456
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:08,380
help us with music and art why is that a

457
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:09,850
lesser area that we shouldn't be

458
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:13,090
focusing on so before we even like to

459
00:16:13,090 --> 00:16:14,260
talk about music and art I want to give

460
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:16,780
you like the two-second introduction to

461
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:18,100
machine learning because if you haven't

462
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:19,000
heard of it I don't want you to like

463
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,320
feel bad because machine learning is

464
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,060
really not that special it's like a

465
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:24,130
glorified function we know functions

466
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:26,440
we've been writing algorithms and

467
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:28,000
functions for like all of our

468
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,480
professional life a classic algorithm or

469
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:32,920
function is to double a number this

470
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,330
one's an easy one you put in a number

471
00:16:34,330 --> 00:16:35,800
you double it and that's what our

472
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,660
function looks like for any X we can

473
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:40,480
double it we can have more complicated

474
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:40,930
function

475
00:16:40,930 --> 00:16:42,760
our algorithms like what would be the

476
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:45,339
function to get from here to the closest

477
00:16:45,339 --> 00:16:48,040
kaya toast place there was like

478
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,839
algorithms for this like bellman-ford or

479
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:51,310
like better ones cuz bellman-ford is

480
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:53,410
from like 30 years ago and it probably

481
00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:56,950
doesn't actually work with maps but we

482
00:16:56,950 --> 00:16:59,740
have this we can do this is not super

483
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:02,680
hard but we have like functions that we

484
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:05,439
don't really know how to write like how

485
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:06,699
would you write a function to decide if

486
00:17:06,699 --> 00:17:09,010
something's a dog or a cat so if I put

487
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:10,750
in a dog it says dog and if I put in a

488
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:12,819
cat it says cat and it does so reliably

489
00:17:12,819 --> 00:17:15,339
so if I put in a fancier kind of cat it

490
00:17:15,339 --> 00:17:17,050
still knows that it's a cat and if I put

491
00:17:17,050 --> 00:17:19,120
like a sausage dog it tells me it's a

492
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:22,480
dog and not a sausage but I don't know

493
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,260
how to write that

494
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:25,480
like what is a cat is like an

495
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,579
existentialist crisis in my life because

496
00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:29,710
I live with a cat like what is a cat is

497
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:31,870
it a lump of fur that just sits there

498
00:17:31,870 --> 00:17:36,100
and judges can I write that in binary no

499
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:37,300
can I write that in JavaScript

500
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:39,580
absolutely no you can start thinking

501
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:41,350
about heuristics like what makes a dog

502
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:43,540
maybe if it has like media like beady

503
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:46,210
black eyes and like a snout but no

504
00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:48,190
whiskers that's a dog but if it has

505
00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:49,600
whiskers it's a cat but there's dogs

506
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,250
that have whiskers and there's cats that

507
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:53,200
look like dogs and there's blueberry

508
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:57,429
muffins that look like dogs so that is

509
00:17:57,429 --> 00:17:59,110
just not gonna fly right that's not a

510
00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:01,380
function that we know how to write

511
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:03,460
there's if you google this you're gonna

512
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:05,140
get like tons of like dogs that look

513
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:09,550
like foods because these are that's what

514
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:11,890
we do if we write functions so that's

515
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:13,030
what machine learning comes into play

516
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:14,380
where she learning is just a different

517
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:16,240
way of writing these functions so that

518
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,130
it figures out what that function is by

519
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:20,710
just feeding it examples I don't need to

520
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:23,170
know what makes a dog dog I just need to

521
00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:25,270
give it enough examples of a dog so that

522
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:27,130
if it sees any dog it goes yep that's a

523
00:18:27,130 --> 00:18:28,870
dog because that's what we really do as

524
00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:31,540
humans we've seen a lot of dogs in the

525
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:33,360
world that's how we know what a dog is

526
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:36,429
so the way we train these models and

527
00:18:36,429 --> 00:18:37,780
what I mean by model I mean this

528
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:39,760
function whenever you hear a machine

529
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,410
learning person be like I use the model

530
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:42,760
to predict they just mean what is the

531
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:45,190
output of the function so to train this

532
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:47,230
model we basically feed it by hand

533
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:50,110
labeled examples so we know this is a

534
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:52,150
dog and we know this is a cat so we fit

535
00:18:52,150 --> 00:18:53,650
it feet on a picture of a dog where we

536
00:18:53,650 --> 00:18:54,450
know what the answer is

537
00:18:54,450 --> 00:18:56,160
but we don't tell it we're tricking the

538
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,260
model because we're cruel like that it's

539
00:18:58,260 --> 00:18:59,550
like those people who are pushing those

540
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:01,770
robots like the you know the robots that

541
00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:03,300
look like dogs and they're like putting

542
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:04,560
all these videos of like look at this

543
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:07,020
dog falling over and getting up they're

544
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:09,020
the first to die in the robot apocalypse

545
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:11,340
not us we are nice we're feeding at

546
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:13,290
pictures of dogs so we put in this

547
00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:14,190
picture of a dog and we're like hey

548
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:16,110
model what is it and the model doesn't

549
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:17,370
know at this point so he goes is it a

550
00:19:17,370 --> 00:19:18,990
cat and you're like oh that's silly this

551
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:20,760
is a dog and then you give it a picture

552
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,410
of a cat and the model goes I don't know

553
00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:23,940
is this a cat here's like very good

554
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:25,590
model you're doing great that is a cat

555
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:28,050
and then you do this a million times and

556
00:19:28,050 --> 00:19:29,490
I'm not kidding about this I literally

557
00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:32,280
mean like the data sets have a million

558
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:34,170
data points of dogs and cats and the

559
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:35,640
model looks at it over and over and over

560
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,680
again until it goes listen I think I got

561
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:40,080
it I most of the time I don't get this

562
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,000
wrong and I think I know it so then when

563
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,050
you show it a picture of a dog it goes

564
00:19:43,050 --> 00:19:44,040
yes it's a dog and you're like

565
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:47,220
absolutely you did it of course this

566
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:48,780
depends on like what kind of data you're

567
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:50,010
putting and if you're only putting in

568
00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:51,860
pictures of cats and golden retrievers

569
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:53,910
machine learning isn't magic this

570
00:19:53,910 --> 00:19:55,620
function isn't magic if you show it a

571
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:56,790
picture of a beagle but you've only

572
00:19:56,790 --> 00:19:58,800
trained in golden retrievers it's not

573
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,180
going to know this as a dog it's

574
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:01,920
probably gonna flip a coin this is how

575
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,540
we get racist algorithms and though in

576
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:05,400
the world by the way it's because we

577
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,720
only feed at pictures of white people

578
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,370
and then we like ask it to categorize a

579
00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:10,050
black person and it goes monkey because

580
00:20:10,050 --> 00:20:11,700
it hasn't seen a black person because

581
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:13,260
you're a terrible engineer and what are

582
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:14,700
you doing with that data this makes me

583
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:17,610
really angry so training data is really

584
00:20:17,610 --> 00:20:19,170
important so this is how he trying to

585
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:20,750
machine learning models see it's done

586
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:22,710
behind the scenes it's like really

587
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:24,120
complicated but it doesn't matter

588
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:26,100
because what we need to understand

589
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:27,690
machine learning is like how you know

590
00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:30,110
the basics of it and how it works so

591
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:32,220
machine learning hasn't isn't

592
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:33,630
particularly new I think like the first

593
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:34,890
neural networks that were like in the

594
00:20:34,890 --> 00:20:36,990
60s and the 70s we've had quite a long

595
00:20:36,990 --> 00:20:39,300
time with them but they haven't exploded

596
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:41,250
to like five or ten years ago really

597
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:44,550
five years ago because we used to suck a

598
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:46,200
lot in machine learning our computers

599
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,780
were really slow we didn't have GPUs so

600
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:50,870
we were really bad at doing matrix math

601
00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:52,950
machine learning is all matrix math

602
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:54,540
nowadays and in particular we didn't

603
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:56,040
have any of these training data sets

604
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:57,870
like the cats and the dogs that I showed

605
00:20:57,870 --> 00:20:59,220
you we didn't have a million data points

606
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:01,070
and if we did they were really pixelated

607
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:03,920
so we weren't really able to like

608
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:06,090
generate really good cats or dogs

609
00:21:06,090 --> 00:21:07,380
so we

610
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:09,090
really good at this because the methods

611
00:21:09,090 --> 00:21:10,440
got better the algorithms got better

612
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:12,420
GPUs are like powerful and we've

613
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:14,160
sacrificed a lot of goats and firstborn

614
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,630
and now we have like incredibly fast

615
00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:19,320
computers and it's great so because

616
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,670
we're really good at this we are so

617
00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:22,020
really good at generative model so the

618
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:23,610
model that I showed you before is called

619
00:21:23,610 --> 00:21:25,710
a classifier what it's really good at is

620
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:28,470
basically labeling data it looks at a

621
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:30,120
cat and goes yes it's a cat a generative

622
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,740
model is something that without any

623
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:34,050
input generates something so for example

624
00:21:34,050 --> 00:21:36,300
it would be able to generate cats and

625
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:38,130
dogs that look like the cats and dogs

626
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:39,750
and the data set but aren't memorized

627
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:42,480
the joy just like them but not exactly

628
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:45,270
the same and we've got a really good at

629
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:47,370
these two with with a model called again

630
00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:49,980
a general general address all your

631
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:53,580
network which is notably really good at

632
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:55,950
generating faces that don't exist it's

633
00:21:55,950 --> 00:21:59,820
wildly creepy this this is a set of

634
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:01,110
websites that used to exist that got

635
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:03,060
taken down because holding servers up is

636
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:05,490
hard but none of these people are real

637
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:07,170
these people don't exist in real life

638
00:22:07,170 --> 00:22:09,420
these people are the output of a machine

639
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:11,520
learning algorithm that is really really

640
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,740
really good at generating believable

641
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:15,330
faces and if you want to know about how

642
00:22:15,330 --> 00:22:17,040
this works come chat with me later it's

643
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:20,190
actually really interesting but this is

644
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:21,060
the thing that we're really good at

645
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:22,620
we're really good at generating cats

646
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:24,090
that don't exist and sometimes they have

647
00:22:24,090 --> 00:22:26,540
like weird artifacts like the one on the

648
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:29,520
unicorn side of the stage but they're

649
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:32,310
still like very believable cats we can

650
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:36,810
generate rooms that don't exist oh all

651
00:22:36,810 --> 00:22:38,700
of these by the way are because for

652
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:39,960
better or for worse these are the

653
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:42,150
datasets that we have so like machine

654
00:22:42,150 --> 00:22:43,560
learning researchers are like well the

655
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:44,970
data sets that I have are people cats

656
00:22:44,970 --> 00:22:49,050
and Airbnb is so let's do it but none of

657
00:22:49,050 --> 00:22:51,960
these rooms again exist like this is a

658
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:53,370
completely like a machine learning

659
00:22:53,370 --> 00:22:55,410
algorithm dreamed up this bedroom that

660
00:22:55,410 --> 00:22:57,840
now exists and is going for like

661
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:01,230
probably a billion pounds in London but

662
00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:02,610
we're not just good at like images we're

663
00:23:02,610 --> 00:23:05,130
also in the in recent time became really

664
00:23:05,130 --> 00:23:07,620
good at music so a transformer is a

665
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:09,690
different kind of model that's usually

666
00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:12,390
used for language but music is a little

667
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:14,550
bit like language so now we're able to

668
00:23:14,550 --> 00:23:21,040
generate things that sound like this

669
00:23:21,050 --> 00:23:40,520
[Music]

670
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:42,930
and it goes on forever because the model

671
00:23:42,930 --> 00:23:45,990
doesn't know how to end songs that's

672
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:47,850
based on research by like one of my

673
00:23:47,850 --> 00:23:49,590
coworker is called Anna Huang and she's

674
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:51,390
brilliant as she's going to solve music

675
00:23:51,390 --> 00:23:52,980
so it's really great we're able to like

676
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:54,840
generate music but what does that mean

677
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:57,630
to a musician or to an artist because I

678
00:23:57,630 --> 00:24:00,270
don't want somebody to generate music

679
00:24:00,270 --> 00:24:01,710
for me I want them to generate music

680
00:24:01,710 --> 00:24:04,320
with me I want it to be a really smart

681
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:07,440
instrument because we live in this world

682
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:08,730
were like technologies everywhere my

683
00:24:08,730 --> 00:24:10,130
kitchen faucet is literally

684
00:24:10,130 --> 00:24:11,940
voice-activated I can tell it to

685
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:14,160
dispense me a cup of water it's helpful

686
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:16,290
sometimes not helpful most of the time

687
00:24:16,290 --> 00:24:18,840
but I play music in the same way that I

688
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:21,360
did 15 years ago I have a physical piano

689
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,520
and I sit at it and I'm still really bad

690
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:24,930
at composing and I make a lot of

691
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:26,490
mistakes and nobody tells me how to fix

692
00:24:26,490 --> 00:24:28,740
these mistakes and what I want in the

693
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:31,020
world are these better weirder more

694
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:32,790
surprising more inspiring more

695
00:24:32,790 --> 00:24:35,220
configurable instruments and interfaces

696
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:37,140
to make music that can help me make

697
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:38,640
better music because that's what I want

698
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:41,760
to do interfaces like this this is a

699
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:45,120
demo made by taro using one of the

700
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:47,550
magenta models so he basically generates

701
00:24:47,550 --> 00:24:49,200
a whole bunch of melodies with one of

702
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,090
our models and then as you go up and

703
00:24:51,090 --> 00:24:53,520
down the key that that melody is in and

704
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:56,280
as you go left to right the melody

705
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:58,650
changes so with this instrument you can

706
00:24:58,650 --> 00:25:01,290
make things like this

707
00:25:01,290 --> 00:25:17,960
[Music]

708
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:22,290
that's a good song we also had something

709
00:25:22,290 --> 00:25:23,820
like the Google Doodle that he may have

710
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:25,380
seen for box birthday like about a month

711
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:28,200
ago where there was this little app that

712
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:31,080
lets you enter a melody and it would

713
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:33,000
like harmonize with you and make a box

714
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,870
sounding for voice Corral and this was a

715
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:39,000
fun little game but we also explored

716
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,080
what it would look like if we're going

717
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,760
to build like a fuller instrument for

718
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,710
somebody to compose with so I built this

719
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:46,280
like side app for it where you basically

720
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:48,750
get to like interact with a model more

721
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:59,710
so you get to like draw a little melody

722
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:01,429
which you might recognize as the legal

723
00:26:01,429 --> 00:26:04,519
version of seven nation army and then we

724
00:26:04,519 --> 00:26:06,230
can ask the model to like fill in this

725
00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:07,789
melody and give us the other three

726
00:26:07,789 --> 00:26:18,090
voices

727
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:20,840
but then we can also play with like

728
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:22,700
whatever attributes the model exposes so

729
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:24,470
temperature is a thing that and machine

730
00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:26,270
learning sort of means a randomness so

731
00:26:26,270 --> 00:26:28,100
if I decrease the temperature sort of

732
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:37,080
like the entropy of it it's conservative

733
00:26:37,090 --> 00:26:39,710
or I can crank up the temperature and

734
00:26:39,710 --> 00:26:42,769
make it like super random and it's going

735
00:26:42,769 --> 00:26:44,419
to put a lot of like arbitrary notes in

736
00:26:44,419 --> 00:26:45,799
there they don't really match and make

737
00:26:45,799 --> 00:26:49,280
Bach like shudder

738
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:54,630
[Music]

739
00:26:54,630 --> 00:26:56,700
and at this point like everything is

740
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:58,260
configurable you can start like erasing

741
00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:00,090
some of the notes asking the model to

742
00:27:00,090 --> 00:27:01,799
like infill a particular section maybe

743
00:27:01,799 --> 00:27:03,470
throw away a whole bunch of things and

744
00:27:03,470 --> 00:27:06,059
like try to play with it and compose in

745
00:27:06,059 --> 00:27:07,590
this app and at the end you can download

746
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:09,210
the MIDI and it's your MIDI you've

747
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:11,820
composed a new melody with it and these

748
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:12,780
are the kind of things that we want to

749
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:15,330
build we can also build weird interfaces

750
00:27:15,330 --> 00:27:17,850
where we figured out there's a model one

751
00:27:17,850 --> 00:27:20,490
of our nerve residents built where you

752
00:27:20,490 --> 00:27:23,280
summarize 88 keys on a piano to eight so

753
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:24,750
rather than playing the whole piano you

754
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:26,860
can play eight of them

755
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:40,009
[Music]

756
00:27:40,019 --> 00:27:42,429
and you're really prolific and great and

757
00:27:42,429 --> 00:27:43,929
you might be like well that's silly what

758
00:27:43,929 --> 00:27:45,969
applications do you have of this but the

759
00:27:45,969 --> 00:27:48,489
Flaming Lips use this at Google i/o for

760
00:27:48,489 --> 00:27:50,049
their concert but rather than playing

761
00:27:50,049 --> 00:27:51,909
eight buttons they played fruit we

762
00:27:51,909 --> 00:27:54,279
connected those eight buttons to a Miki

763
00:27:54,279 --> 00:27:56,049
Miki and then as they were playing the

764
00:27:56,049 --> 00:27:58,409
fruit the model would like make the next

765
00:27:58,409 --> 00:28:00,999
correct node and like it was a really

766
00:28:00,999 --> 00:28:03,729
fun interactive thing we've also built a

767
00:28:03,729 --> 00:28:05,799
set of Ableton plugins because it turns

768
00:28:05,799 --> 00:28:08,080
out music musicians live in Ableton so

769
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,219
we were like well what it would look

770
00:28:09,219 --> 00:28:10,450
like if you put these machine learning

771
00:28:10,450 --> 00:28:12,129
models in Ableton would that be useful

772
00:28:12,129 --> 00:28:14,379
and you can go read about them because

773
00:28:14,379 --> 00:28:16,450
I'm already gonna be five minutes over

774
00:28:16,450 --> 00:28:19,419
time and we can do this with art - we

775
00:28:19,419 --> 00:28:20,499
don't just do it with music

776
00:28:20,499 --> 00:28:22,599
we're just most of us are musicians less

777
00:28:22,599 --> 00:28:26,080
artists nobody cares about me we have

778
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,879
models that have looked at people

779
00:28:27,879 --> 00:28:29,559
sketching things so they're really good

780
00:28:29,559 --> 00:28:31,389
at drawing cats like a million people

781
00:28:31,389 --> 00:28:33,339
draw cats so I build this silly thing

782
00:28:33,339 --> 00:28:35,200
where you start drawing a cat and then

783
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,179
the model continues it for you and then

784
00:28:37,179 --> 00:28:38,559
you can draw a whole bunch of different

785
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:42,190
animals like a crab or a truck that's

786
00:28:42,190 --> 00:28:44,649
gonna be off-screen it has wheels

787
00:28:44,649 --> 00:28:49,059
thank you swear or a whale and this

788
00:28:49,059 --> 00:28:51,070
isn't art I understand this is an art

789
00:28:51,070 --> 00:28:52,690
when I said that I have a problem with

790
00:28:52,690 --> 00:28:54,700
the word art I understand fully that you

791
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:56,679
should judge this this is not art but it

792
00:28:56,679 --> 00:28:58,239
doesn't mean he can't be first of all

793
00:28:58,239 --> 00:29:00,129
kids love the out of this and

794
00:29:00,129 --> 00:29:01,929
second of all if you spend time like

795
00:29:01,929 --> 00:29:03,789
putting a model that also understands

796
00:29:03,789 --> 00:29:05,049
painting and stuff like that you can

797
00:29:05,049 --> 00:29:06,940
start making believable things with this

798
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:09,009
the things that we make and on the

799
00:29:09,009 --> 00:29:11,200
magenta team isn't like products that we

800
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,849
make money out of we make models and

801
00:29:12,849 --> 00:29:14,409
then experiences so that people can use

802
00:29:14,409 --> 00:29:16,599
them and you can make money out of it

803
00:29:16,599 --> 00:29:18,999
and the thing about all of the demos

804
00:29:18,999 --> 00:29:20,379
that I showed you literally all of them

805
00:29:20,379 --> 00:29:22,119
is that they're all done in JavaScript

806
00:29:22,119 --> 00:29:23,589
we have a library it's open source it's

807
00:29:23,589 --> 00:29:25,629
called magenta Jas and it's built on top

808
00:29:25,629 --> 00:29:28,330
of tensorflow J's in such a way that you

809
00:29:28,330 --> 00:29:29,559
can use all of this machine learning

810
00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:30,700
without having to know what machine

811
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:32,200
learning is the models are pre-trained

812
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:34,419
the api's are super simple so that you

813
00:29:34,419 --> 00:29:35,950
can take them and just make whatever

814
00:29:35,950 --> 00:29:38,909
your heart desires and it's really easy

815
00:29:38,909 --> 00:29:41,679
that spinners the incredible spinners

816
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:43,989
the way those random melodies were

817
00:29:43,989 --> 00:29:44,650
generated

818
00:29:44,650 --> 00:29:46,540
is with this model called music VA

819
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:48,820
that's good at generating fairly robotic

820
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:51,130
sounding music let's be very honest so

821
00:29:51,130 --> 00:29:52,690
you create a model and then you ask it

822
00:29:52,690 --> 00:29:54,280
to give you a sample and this gives you

823
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:55,870
back a sequence which is a lot like MIDI

824
00:29:55,870 --> 00:29:57,309
is just like an object it looks like

825
00:29:57,309 --> 00:29:59,230
MIDI and then you can create a player

826
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:01,450
which wraps tone jeaious because making

827
00:30:01,450 --> 00:30:03,220
web audio and the browser in 2019 is

828
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:04,750
actually still horrifyingly hard and you

829
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:06,880
should never do that so the player does

830
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,410
all of that heavy lifting for you and

831
00:30:08,410 --> 00:30:09,520
then you'd give it the sequence and you

832
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,020
go players start and then you can hear

833
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:12,850
it in a synthesizer or a piano or

834
00:30:12,850 --> 00:30:15,280
whatever you want and I'm not like

835
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:16,330
pulling your leg here it's literally

836
00:30:16,330 --> 00:30:17,620
like four lines of code to generate

837
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:22,210
infinitely sounding melodies maybe you

838
00:30:22,210 --> 00:30:23,559
want to put that into the Bach chorale

839
00:30:23,559 --> 00:30:25,720
you can take the sequence that again the

840
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:27,220
robots generated for you

841
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:28,720
you can create the other model called

842
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,520
coconut which is the one that does the

843
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:32,380
Bach infilling and then you can ask it

844
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:33,760
to infilled that sequence and it gives

845
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:35,679
you back a four voice sequence or a

846
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:37,540
chorale and then you can again pass that

847
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:39,010
to the player and go play or play me

848
00:30:39,010 --> 00:30:42,250
this and this is exactly how you you you

849
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:44,500
generate all of those Corral's in the

850
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:46,809
demo that I showed you the piano genie

851
00:30:46,809 --> 00:30:48,059
with a fort live with the eight buttons

852
00:30:48,059 --> 00:30:50,860
super similar you create the model you

853
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:52,330
ask you you tell you that you've pressed

854
00:30:52,330 --> 00:30:53,830
a button and like how random you want

855
00:30:53,830 --> 00:30:55,000
the output to be and it gives you the

856
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,070
next note over and over and over again

857
00:30:57,070 --> 00:30:59,440
as you're playing it and the reason why

858
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:02,080
we work on this library is because we

859
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:03,580
really believe that code should never

860
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:05,590
hold back art if that API looks

861
00:31:05,590 --> 00:31:08,410
surprisingly easy it's not a random it's

862
00:31:08,410 --> 00:31:10,150
a deliberate decision because when we're

863
00:31:10,150 --> 00:31:11,620
a meeting with musicians it turns out

864
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:13,120
musicians don't really know how to

865
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:15,070
install Python and Python dependencies

866
00:31:15,070 --> 00:31:17,470
and get our Python code that would take

867
00:31:17,470 --> 00:31:20,260
like 17 command-line parameters to work

868
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:21,760
and then we'll give you like a MIDI file

869
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:24,040
in your temp directory you just don't

870
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:25,090
really know how to do this they used

871
00:31:25,090 --> 00:31:27,010
Ableton and we want people to build

872
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:29,440
tools for musicians because that's the

873
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:30,520
people that we want to interact with

874
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:32,679
artists and creators not just like

875
00:31:32,679 --> 00:31:34,330
engineers who really want to write

876
00:31:34,330 --> 00:31:37,030
snakes on their computer snakes is what

877
00:31:37,030 --> 00:31:38,820
I call Python feel free to take that one

878
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:40,990
spiders is what I call JavaScript your

879
00:31:40,990 --> 00:31:43,480
future take that one too and this makes

880
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:44,740
sense if you think of your favorite

881
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:46,929
painter or like artist the guy's one of

882
00:31:46,929 --> 00:31:49,300
mine did God didn't make his own pastels

883
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:51,190
he bought them from Cinelli which was a

884
00:31:51,190 --> 00:31:53,140
man who spent his entire life making

885
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:55,090
chalk pastels he couldn't draw worth

886
00:31:55,090 --> 00:31:56,410
 and they got couldn't make his own

887
00:31:56,410 --> 00:31:57,150
and they got couldn't make his own
pastels

888
00:31:57,150 --> 00:31:59,760
yo-yo ma doesn't build his own cellos he

889
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,200
like buys them from people who made them

890
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:04,770
in the 1600s the artists don't shouldn't

891
00:32:04,770 --> 00:32:06,720
make the tools to make the art they're

892
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,430
there to make the art itself

893
00:32:08,430 --> 00:32:10,620
because at the end of the day the medium

894
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:12,180
influences how the message is perceived

895
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:13,890
this is a quote by Marshall McLuhan who

896
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:17,430
is a Canadian go Canada but it's trying

897
00:32:17,430 --> 00:32:19,170
to tell you that like models don't exist

898
00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:21,059
in a void they exist in like this

899
00:32:21,059 --> 00:32:22,890
artistic environment that we live in and

900
00:32:22,890 --> 00:32:24,750
how we deliver these models to people

901
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:26,550
and what you do with the models is the

902
00:32:26,550 --> 00:32:28,559
thing that messes that matters that is

903
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:31,230
the medium so I want to show you I'm

904
00:32:31,230 --> 00:32:33,090
going to end with like these examples of

905
00:32:33,090 --> 00:32:36,660
a couple of art installations remember

906
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:39,240
the creepy generated images of people

907
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:40,740
that don't exist that we're really good

908
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:43,590
at Mario Clingerman has an art

909
00:32:43,590 --> 00:32:44,850
installation has several art

910
00:32:44,850 --> 00:32:47,130
installations actually that uses that

911
00:32:47,130 --> 00:32:49,410
algorithm to generate infinitely many

912
00:32:49,410 --> 00:32:51,510
portraits so as you come into this room

913
00:32:51,510 --> 00:32:54,360
these paintings of people just get

914
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:56,160
generated for ever and ever and you can

915
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,929
look at them the thing about this

916
00:32:57,929 --> 00:33:00,450
installation is that it wasn't possible

917
00:33:00,450 --> 00:33:01,800
five years ago it wouldn't have been

918
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:03,570
possible without these machine learning

919
00:33:03,570 --> 00:33:05,550
algorithm the algorithms that we have

920
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:08,190
today a painter is not able to generate

921
00:33:08,190 --> 00:33:11,100
infinitely many portraits we can count

922
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:12,870
to infinity it's like a lot it takes a

923
00:33:12,870 --> 00:33:16,350
bunch of time so this is a way that we

924
00:33:16,350 --> 00:33:18,059
can use machine learning in art and

925
00:33:18,059 --> 00:33:19,980
still maintain that integrity of art

926
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:22,380
this is one of my favorite things that

927
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:24,420
I've ever seen in my life it's an art

928
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:26,280
installation called peeping skulls by

929
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:28,440
Robbie Barrett and Ronon Burroughs same

930
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:30,780
name different people Robbie Barrett is

931
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:32,429
an artist it is a lot of art with

932
00:33:32,429 --> 00:33:34,350
artificial intelligence and Ronon

933
00:33:34,350 --> 00:33:36,660
Barrett is an oil painter so they got

934
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:38,970
together and based on running Barrett's

935
00:33:38,970 --> 00:33:39,960
painting style

936
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:41,910
Robbie trained a model to generate

937
00:33:41,910 --> 00:33:43,950
skulls that look like Ronon would have

938
00:33:43,950 --> 00:33:45,600
painted them and they actually exhibited

939
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:49,140
this as an installation next to physical

940
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:52,440
paintings of these skulls in a museum

941
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:55,170
and what happens in this installation is

942
00:33:55,170 --> 00:33:57,000
that he walk up to it and then you look

943
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,380
and it tells you what's about to happen

944
00:33:58,380 --> 00:34:00,179
you're going to get generated a random

945
00:34:00,179 --> 00:34:02,460
skull that looks like a run and Barrett

946
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:05,340
oil painting this is this one and you

947
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:06,960
get to look at it for five to ten

948
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:10,020
seconds

949
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:11,740
and then it disappears forever and it's

950
00:34:11,740 --> 00:34:13,360
been marked in the algorithm machine

951
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:15,010
learning algorithm so that I can never

952
00:34:15,010 --> 00:34:17,169
get generated again if the out of the

953
00:34:17,169 --> 00:34:18,760
machine learning algorithm tries to

954
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:20,350
generate this again if the model does it

955
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:21,970
it's going to try to generate another

956
00:34:21,970 --> 00:34:24,040
one this was your skull and your skull

957
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:26,560
alone and in this weird Instagram world

958
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:28,270
where you post like our entire lives two

959
00:34:28,270 --> 00:34:30,100
stories this is like an amazing

960
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:32,650
commentary about this intimacy of this

961
00:34:32,650 --> 00:34:34,210
art experiments where we can all

962
00:34:34,210 --> 00:34:35,950
experiment like we can all live this

963
00:34:35,950 --> 00:34:37,510
experiment but never share what we

964
00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:38,620
actually saw and I think this is

965
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:41,409
fantastic there's this great quote from

966
00:34:41,409 --> 00:34:44,080
Brian Eno that says that what you now

967
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:46,390
find weird ugly uncomfortable and nasty

968
00:34:46,390 --> 00:34:48,190
about a new medium will surely become

969
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:48,850
its signature

970
00:34:48,850 --> 00:34:50,560
the distorted guitar sound is the sound

971
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:52,240
of something too loud for the medium

972
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:54,550
supposed to carry it everything that you

973
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:56,560
love in the world right now has at one

974
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:59,320
point been judged and looked down by

975
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:02,110
people probably white men from weird

976
00:35:02,110 --> 00:35:04,600
music - Impressionism - cubism -

977
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:06,130
assembling your own Swedish chairs in

978
00:35:06,130 --> 00:35:08,920
your living room and making art with AI

979
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:11,560
and math and algorithms isn't new and

980
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:13,780
maybe feels uncomfortable now but that

981
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:15,160
doesn't mean we shouldn't encourage it

982
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:16,750
to grow because I think it's got great

983
00:35:16,750 --> 00:35:18,940
opportunities and I think this means

984
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:21,220
that a lot of us should start making

985
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:23,560
really serious things so that you know

986
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:26,710
somewhere out there somebody can make a

987
00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:28,810
random painting of a skull that exists

988
00:35:28,810 --> 00:35:30,400
for five seconds and then it disappears

989
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,180
forever
