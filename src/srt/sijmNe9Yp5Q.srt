1
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:21,600

awesome hey how it's gone so uh yeah sir

2
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,410
I am zypher if if you know me probably

3
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:27,090
owned by that but since they're all here

4
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:28,500
and we're all friends and glee Michael

5
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:32,309
and I really love what we have in our

6
00:00:32,309 --> 00:00:33,570
community it's kind of special in that

7
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:34,860
they're very few communities that are

8
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:37,380
open to sharing and having events like

9
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:41,700
this and like as part of that part of

10
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:43,469
the team that runs this is confer you I

11
00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:45,210
with some other great people of you here

12
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:47,489
and Glenn he'll be speaking later and I

13
00:00:47,489 --> 00:00:49,410
also helped run one of the bigger front

14
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:52,980
end meetups back home in Melbourne and i

15
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:54,329
really love up and saw some of that we

16
00:00:54,329 --> 00:00:55,770
can share our code and we can all learn

17
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:57,210
from each other and really build on the

18
00:00:57,210 --> 00:00:59,370
shoulder of giants and as part of that I

19
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:00,840
country the projects like a lib

20
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:03,899
sassanids us but this is anas a stalk

21
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:06,600
I'm not here to tell you how amazing

22
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,100
sasses but they should use a SAS or not

23
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:11,909
this is actually a story and it's my

24
00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:14,369
story and it's a story of all about how

25
00:01:14,369 --> 00:01:16,580
my life got flipped turned upside down

26
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:18,750
I'd like to take a minute just sit right

27
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:27,500
there I'd tell how became a real program

28
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:29,770
so I want to start with a smaller side

29
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:34,900
so back home in australia until the end

30
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:36,729
of primary schools about the age of 12

31
00:01:36,729 --> 00:01:40,000
13 your entire schooling you work in our

32
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,580
pencil you never use pens and the idea

33
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:43,869
is that in your final year of primary

34
00:01:43,869 --> 00:01:45,369
school you go through a stink will

35
00:01:45,369 --> 00:01:46,810
depend license and you have to prove

36
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:49,030
that your handwriting is legible enough

37
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:50,680
that you can use a pen and not make

38
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:56,740
mistakes and uh so I got my pen license

39
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:58,270
I was the last one to get my pen less

40
00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:00,759
instead of my entire level and to this

41
00:02:00,759 --> 00:02:02,289
day I'm pretty sure I got our obligation

42
00:02:02,289 --> 00:02:05,080
because I deserved it and since about

43
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:08,200
the age of 12 and so if we think back

44
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:10,119
this is like looking back in my life

45
00:02:10,119 --> 00:02:11,410
this is kind of I started programming

46
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:14,860
very early know by the age of like eight

47
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:16,810
or nine I was very plainly things like

48
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:18,880
basic making like really simple bit back

49
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,850
bitmap pixel games that kind of stuff

50
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:23,230
and then not long before that not long

51
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:25,000
after that I learned HTML because it's

52
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,890
kind of really simply need a notepad my

53
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:27,970
computer is really terrible and this

54
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:33,549
kind of worked and I she was about it

55
00:02:33,549 --> 00:02:35,410
was about this time that I got my pen

56
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:37,390
license so at this point i could

57
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:38,769
probably pretty confidently like to

58
00:02:38,769 --> 00:02:40,269
relatively basic languages i get some

59
00:02:40,269 --> 00:02:42,549
stuff done yo comped earlier high school

60
00:02:42,549 --> 00:02:44,140
i start messing around with like hello

61
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:45,070
world apps and really kind of

62
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:46,750
command-line apps in like python and

63
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:50,170
moving on to things like c and then in

64
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:51,370
very early high school i discovered

65
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:53,500
flash i just got to blue my vines i

66
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:54,700
could actually see what i was doing no

67
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:56,470
more hello world No More CL eyes like

68
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:58,360
really pretty interactive stuff other

69
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,400
than flash actionscript like that kind

70
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,660
of blew my mind Zac object orientated

71
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:04,180
programming inside this action script is

72
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:06,310
a pretty language there later in high

73
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:08,829
school we had a part of our schooling we

74
00:03:08,829 --> 00:03:11,620
learn like Excel and Word and like the

75
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:13,299
built-in like vba language in that and

76
00:03:13,299 --> 00:03:15,549
from that moves like some of us are

77
00:03:15,549 --> 00:03:16,630
really curious that playing a visual

78
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:19,299
basic and then you know this web person

79
00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:21,640
kept eating at me so I found out his PHP

80
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,260
and got involved in like sitepoint stuff

81
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:25,030
and our big on PHP at the time so I

82
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:27,340
learn how to play with the web then

83
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:28,870
unique comes around and like we all have

84
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:30,670
to do java the web car disappears for me

85
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:32,650
for a while but i can't i can't get away

86
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:34,420
i keep going back to it so I learned

87
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:35,520
jquery

88
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:38,640
not JavaScript jQuery I'll proudly say

89
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:43,440
that so then I got a job writing PHP and

90
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,330
jquery for a company after dropping out

91
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:48,260
of uni and I started messing with a

92
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:50,370
c-sharp was like an internal project we

93
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:52,380
had that people started using foolishly

94
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:54,990
and then we moved on to some Ruby stuff

95
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:58,260
and then like I couldn't get way from

96
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:00,810
this web thing later on I start working

97
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:03,180
like an agency moved mostly to front end

98
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:05,280
stuff i started doing ere you รง sister

99
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,560
HTML got really excited yeah something

100
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,960
some javascript stuff that eventually

101
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,610
leads to things like node and then like

102
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:13,020
I got really the performance and anyone

103
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:14,400
like worth their salt performance wants

104
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,540
to know everything about how everything

105
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:17,520
is working so you like engine X and a

106
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:18,870
passion you're tweaking things and like

107
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:22,170
how can I make this faster oh then it's

108
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:23,670
like our map start getting bigger and

109
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:25,260
bigger bigger companies like this

110
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:26,970
setting is crazy it's all over the place

111
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:29,100
how do we how do we manage this just

112
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:30,510
stop playing with sass and they removed

113
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:32,450
for to today and like I was using react

114
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:34,830
and like this all seems kind of crazy

115
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:37,260
like who does all this all these

116
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:39,360
languages and but actually have been

117
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,070
really simple because they all spring

118
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:43,890
from the stink like c-style languages so

119
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:46,080
we look at it something like a C++ for

120
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,090
example which is like one of those big

121
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:51,060
boy languages and we look at me see

122
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:53,340
things like all right we can figure out

123
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:54,960
we got like a variable assignment here

124
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,510
we've got like a function like that

125
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:59,520
we're taking a string you're adding the

126
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,110
input of the function to another string

127
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:02,580
or defined and returning that and just

128
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:04,200
calling that function it's pretty simple

129
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,910
code for like this like any language I

130
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:07,470
don't know kind of weird thing and this

131
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:09,180
is like we see like the string keyword

132
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:11,760
which is like we assume as a type like

133
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,950
we know our strings are that's all right

134
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:15,420
that's pretty bad it's nothing too

135
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:16,590
difficult but then you take things look

136
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:18,630
at javascript and like let's pretty much

137
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:20,130
the same thing right you got a variable

138
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:22,140
yet the VAR keyword a set of the string

139
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:24,060
like about the type anymore we're still

140
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:25,320
with the function the function name the

141
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,910
function parameter we're still plussing

142
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:28,110
two strings together returning I strand

143
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:29,820
calling a function that's like all right

144
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:31,080
well this is pretty straightforward

145
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,090
we've got a PHP and like this is almost

146
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:34,860
exactly the same thing we've dropped

147
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:36,750
afar and added like dollar signs and

148
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:41,070
otherwise its exact same code take this

149
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:43,770
to SAS exact same thing like we've taken

150
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:45,180
the function return web with that symbol

151
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:46,890
in front of them but yeah under the

152
00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:48,120
covers are all kind of the same things

153
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:48,660
what this same

154
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:51,810
heritage lanikai you moved towards you

155
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:53,670
you are fast your language is anything

156
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:55,440
like Ruby where it's like all this

157
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,760
things made the code readable a now gone

158
00:05:56,760 --> 00:06:01,350
and you kind of like if you've seen like

159
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:02,700
the previous examples you have rats

160
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:04,110
going on but jumping into like this like

161
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:08,040
all right they've taken it too far so

162
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:10,320
it's like it's not it's not hard this

163
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,280
programming things actually really easy

164
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,590
like that language is really language is

165
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:16,020
so easy but actually the whole thing of

166
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:17,670
like learning how to program is hard

167
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:19,290
like what is a ruby isn't whatsapp HP is

168
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:25,050
it was a javascript ism and so the last

169
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:27,270
four years I transitioned almost

170
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:29,070
primarily to entirely front-end

171
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:30,780
theyselves the hardest one market finds

172
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:33,600
most enjoyable problem and things like

173
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,040
an interesting start running meetups and

174
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:37,440
hang out entirely more fronting crowds

175
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,880
then we'd hire more developers in my

176
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,800
current job and they'd never seen me

177
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,720
right back anchored so you can send

178
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,340
questions is like you can do this weird

179
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:47,430
debates like is X even program you CSIS

180
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:49,650
exit programming like what I wanted to

181
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:50,490
do a real code why you're doing this

182
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:52,680
front-end thing like you seem so smart

183
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:57,000
what are you doing with your life this

184
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,980
is like this this is pretty pervasive

185
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:00,420
and I think about this in like what is

186
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:01,650
your programming it's like in the front

187
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:02,760
end with the lowest maintainability

188
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,230
scaling issues that we do on the back

189
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:07,140
end we're so he's doing a bunch of

190
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:08,820
operations here we care about we care

191
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:11,340
about performance yeah and it we have

192
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:12,300
two things like they have to worry about

193
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:13,169
we have to worry about compatibility

194
00:07:13,169 --> 00:07:14,430
they have to wear BEC compatibility or

195
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:16,080
cross-platform like that code they write

196
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,490
it on PHP runs in that server it's

197
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:19,770
always going to work on that server very

198
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:21,120
little is going to break it and we had

199
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,740
this like a whole array of things such

200
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:24,210
different browser to browser versions

201
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:27,169
like a lot of a significantly harder and

202
00:07:27,169 --> 00:07:29,250
so I pondered on this for one really

203
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:31,350
kind of bugged me and I bumped into this

204
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:33,900
mention of the dunning-kruger effect and

205
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:35,400
it's kind of a two-part thing and one is

206
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:38,460
like as people who only know a little

207
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:40,169
bit about a thing can extrapolate what

208
00:07:40,169 --> 00:07:42,150
they know and realize yeah well this is

209
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:44,610
easy like I can make a round corner

210
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:46,230
service I can make like a pie chart out

211
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:47,760
of gradient so I can feel this thing and

212
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,530
I could do like there's so much I can do

213
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:51,150
because I can do this really tiny thing

214
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:52,710
and they don't have you don't know

215
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:53,970
enough to know how much you don't know

216
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:56,280
until you start doing it and we start

217
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,210
list and browse the whole time like this

218
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:58,200
one's really simple when you start

219
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:58,980
messing with it like

220
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:02,610
is really hard and the other side of

221
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:04,440
this and the really kind of toxic part

222
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:07,020
that I find is people who are who are

223
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:08,850
good at something assume everybody is as

224
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:10,830
good as they are and so they belittle

225
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:12,150
what they know it's like well I know

226
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:13,740
this everybody knows this so it can't be

227
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:15,270
that hard and you put these things

228
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:16,710
together and you have like the whole

229
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:18,690
idea of like front-end ebbs people time

230
00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:19,830
when our programmers and we believe

231
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:23,070
we're not programmers this is kind of

232
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:24,750
this thing that's kind of bugged me for

233
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:25,860
a while it's got an inspiration behind

234
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:28,470
this talk of like wow why are we

235
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:32,130
considered programs so in 2011 i joined

236
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:34,500
copy nine on designs and we had this

237
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,840
like ad hoc look was very developed

238
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,700
during very small team we had like

239
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:41,850
multiple generations of the UI and like

240
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:44,070
as you can imagine PHP devs riding

241
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:45,360
front-end code it was everything you

242
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,240
imagined it was an unpleasant was a mess

243
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,830
and I joined as a back-end developer

244
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:51,660
saying that when you care about the

245
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:53,520
front end I'm there this is what I want

246
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:57,510
to do so come around 2012 and we decided

247
00:08:57,510 --> 00:08:58,980
all right when he does responsive thing

248
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:00,570
is kind of cool we need to do it so he

249
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:02,220
did a responsive rebrand started working

250
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:04,530
on this thing and I convinced them we

251
00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:07,320
got to do SAS like used it before it's

252
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,640
incredible he's going to save us so much

253
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,130
time and we started building our

254
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:13,500
internal and internal framework based

255
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:16,320
off foundation and because Royal

256
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,520
Engineers we build a framework for

257
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:21,060
engineers and as a result things were

258
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,110
good for a while we understood we were

259
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:24,510
doing like our PHP guys can write our

260
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:26,880
CSS and like it worked and it was nice

261
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,260
and like everyone could take second

262
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:30,150
languages we're using like using SAS

263
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:32,730
like an API for the most things but as

264
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:34,380
this happened we got more and more code

265
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:36,720
and as we all know compilation times

266
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,540
just like blew out like I won't pull at

267
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:40,650
like six minute eight minute compilation

268
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:42,990
times brought into my compass magic but

269
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:44,310
that like tuna compilation times was

270
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:46,950
kind of brutal and I back in this one no

271
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:48,090
part of its like what are you doing it

272
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:52,080
used to work for us she CSS so I we had

273
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,520
enough and we SAT la vista latest thing

274
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:56,280
called lib sass the idea behind it was

275
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,990
like it was the Ruby such project taking

276
00:09:57,990 --> 00:10:00,330
a C++ an assumption like of it since

277
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:02,550
it'll just be faster like there are

278
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:04,440
other really great benefits of this but

279
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,360
the big thing was like we can put in C

280
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,740
we'll make it fast of all the problems

281
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:09,920
and then Iraq have super fast ass

282
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,540
alright we played with it for a long

283
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:13,070
time and we just couldn't get there like

284
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:14,510
the basic phone mental features were

285
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:16,550
missing so you can even polyfill I was

286
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:18,560
like ah variables of Oregon like that's

287
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:22,459
a problem so we kind of played this in a

288
00:10:22,459 --> 00:10:23,870
bandit because a killer backbone we want

289
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:25,940
to come back to it and so later that

290
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:28,699
year I went to the first caps s in san

291
00:10:28,699 --> 00:10:32,000
francisco and this was my chance like I

292
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,730
had questions for these people so i was

293
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:37,490
there i ran into chris Epstein who is

294
00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:41,709
one of the main riders of SAS along with

295
00:10:41,709 --> 00:10:45,260
Natalie and I ran into Hampton who was

296
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:46,639
running camps ass but also it was like

297
00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:49,430
the original inventor of SAS and the

298
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:51,649
person who had the vision for lib SAS in

299
00:10:51,649 --> 00:10:54,019
the first place and then I ran into Erin

300
00:10:54,019 --> 00:10:56,329
who was the person Hampton convinced to

301
00:10:56,329 --> 00:11:00,769
write lips ass so I had questions for

302
00:11:00,769 --> 00:11:03,649
like why why is that in nerd aren't i

303
00:11:03,649 --> 00:11:05,329
fronted to change nerd like this is days

304
00:11:05,329 --> 00:11:07,820
are like grunt to the thing and like why

305
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:09,050
not make it a nerd things we don't play

306
00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:10,279
together have one big nice things really

307
00:11:10,279 --> 00:11:11,570
know it's faster than Ruby let's just do

308
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:14,839
this and I was I also had a head full of

309
00:11:14,839 --> 00:11:16,040
steam like I'm gonna come back on a

310
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,149
write this like I've started thinking

311
00:11:17,149 --> 00:11:18,560
about it pretty intensely we'd run

312
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,060
accessorize full time for to use at this

313
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:23,720
point bring this framework and I talked

314
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,040
to Hampton he goes you could totally do

315
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,240
that you could definitely write this a

316
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,640
nerd but just know how much time this is

317
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,680
this the next to use your life like

318
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:31,730
there's so many edge case you have no I

319
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:33,079
how much work is going into making sash

320
00:11:33,079 --> 00:11:35,390
do it says does and to start messing

321
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:36,920
with it none like well I don't this

322
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,149
fills back at that in Kruger fact it

323
00:11:38,149 --> 00:11:39,910
feels easy but it's not like all right

324
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:41,720
now look so why is it taking so long

325
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:42,890
then why is this pretty bad for years

326
00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:45,500
like it was almost no progress and it's

327
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:46,670
like well the intersection of people who

328
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:50,120
write C++ and CSS is zero like nobody

329
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:52,730
cares this happens because I'm paying

330
00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:54,260
somebody and I've stopped paying him and

331
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:57,079
I stopped happening it's like all right

332
00:11:57,079 --> 00:12:00,709
all that it's legit so come back home

333
00:12:00,709 --> 00:12:03,800
2014 I'm like I don't think I have

334
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:06,230
enough of my life to write a note

335
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:08,240
version of this like so just about the

336
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,579
bull I could I'll just I'll do some say

337
00:12:10,579 --> 00:12:12,139
this let's get it working I've taught

338
00:12:12,139 --> 00:12:14,260
myself much languages let's just do it

339
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:16,040
completely well I didn't know a single

340
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,720
thing about C++ I could never analyzed

341
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:20,660
supposed to compiled it was really scary

342
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:22,810
to me like C++ is like that's the

343
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:24,850
boy language like he'll write operating

344
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:27,430
systems and games and like this is it

345
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:28,990
when I think my programming is like I

346
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:30,340
miss my on the web but these guys are

347
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:32,830
really these as a building things it was

348
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:34,210
kind of scary thing for me a long time I

349
00:12:34,210 --> 00:12:36,490
put it off for a long time I purpose but

350
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:38,350
figure I let's just do this ragama go

351
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:40,900
start the adventure and we got to get

352
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:42,550
started like thinking back my university

353
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:44,980
days like what is the scary thing my

354
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:46,510
suppose what what do I know I know it's

355
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:47,890
a compiled language which like for most

356
00:12:47,890 --> 00:12:50,140
of like the server's like it's all run

357
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:51,550
time it's kind of happens as you do it's

358
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:54,310
pretty it's interpreted what languages

359
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:56,650
have a doob lot more work initially is a

360
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:58,540
lot of upfront costs but it's kind of

361
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:00,580
weather run faster and there was this

362
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:05,740
linker and it linked to things yeah I

363
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:07,900
actually still don't know what that does

364
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:11,250
really i'm not close to some pain I

365
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:15,010
don't need to know I don't so there are

366
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:17,350
make files so I'm try to think back to

367
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:20,589
like surely we can't be to diverge from

368
00:13:20,589 --> 00:13:22,029
front and the back end like okay I do

369
00:13:22,029 --> 00:13:23,890
the same thing so I'm thinking back like

370
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:25,620
so make files are essentially grunt for

371
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:28,089
C or for unix people like before those

372
00:13:28,089 --> 00:13:29,920
JavaScript there was Mike and then we

373
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:33,190
decided laughter JavaScript grant the

374
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:35,770
grunt make you know preprocessor

375
00:13:35,770 --> 00:13:38,110
directives like this is a he's a

376
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:39,580
relatively complicated and I don't

377
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:41,920
understand him completely but everyone

378
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,030
looked through the lips I source code

379
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:44,080
noises he's include everywhere is

380
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,400
included I'm like all this is obvious

381
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,200
this is just like import right this is

382
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,390
we've done this before there are some

383
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:50,860
differences with the MER spot like I

384
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:52,150
don't you dinner this is going to work

385
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:55,240
the same way I'm is strictly typed which

386
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:57,460
is open first example it's like we're

387
00:13:57,460 --> 00:13:59,170
going to define our types like our

388
00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:01,060
coolest place virus string we sorted

389
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:06,450
good how many times can i really be yeah

390
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:08,440
so it's kind of the same thing we kind

391
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:10,360
of I get a sharp like this it is just

392
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,320
functions of variables as pretty

393
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:13,660
convinced this should be too hard got

394
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:18,700
ahead of files and these are whoa sir

395
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:23,680
java kicked in skip this version cool

396
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,600
so we have our header files and our

397
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,310
header file sir I try to think it was

398
00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:28,960
like like doesn't your bow or mpm like

399
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,460
they're not but they're on the way they

400
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:32,170
express intent it's like this won't work

401
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:33,850
without this thing that I've told you I

402
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:36,370
need like all right well I already miss

403
00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:37,720
them too much I'm gonna get by without

404
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,220
touching them so it's copy and paste

405
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:42,370
what i see so you do a quick sesh lesson

406
00:14:42,370 --> 00:14:44,110
so the big feature missing from SAS that

407
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:46,870
we really needed with SAS maps and so

408
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:48,779
sassa the data structure called lists

409
00:14:48,779 --> 00:14:51,190
unless we're kind of see in CSS is like

410
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:53,350
space separated thing like any kind of

411
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:54,760
shorthand like paddings or margins

412
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:56,410
essentially we should was list inside of

413
00:14:56,410 --> 00:14:58,570
SAS and we have a bunch of list

414
00:14:58,570 --> 00:14:59,920
functions we can find a list of this

415
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,920
becomes like an array essentially being

416
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:04,570
cool ends and say give me the first item

417
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:06,279
in this unlike other languages it's one

418
00:15:06,279 --> 00:15:08,620
indexed I zero indexed but it's pretty

419
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:10,180
simple weeks we've all done is kind of

420
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:13,240
stuff so we have maps and maps a kind

421
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:15,970
like your hash map or impeach page still

422
00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:19,870
in array so Christ simple here we have a

423
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:21,670
list of values we have a hash of values

424
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:23,410
the map values we can like name the

425
00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:24,910
thing we want which is better than we

426
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:27,490
can just say I get me this thing like by

427
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:30,279
name and this like it we scream at this

428
00:15:30,279 --> 00:15:31,630
for years build one of the since ass for

429
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:33,490
so long and I finally landed but live

430
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:35,170
SAS was just so far off the ball that we

431
00:15:35,170 --> 00:15:36,940
this is the thing we need to dump I

432
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:38,350
framework was based off maps I figure if

433
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:40,270
we could just do maps then we gonna we

434
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:42,910
can get there we'll touch there this is

435
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:45,610
my girls on a work on a bringing SAS

436
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:47,440
maps into set until obsess trying to

437
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:50,800
figure it out and uh so the way this

438
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,540
works is every think would suspect like

439
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:53,650
I said test Suites a whole different

440
00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:55,029
project and all it takes is a bunch of

441
00:15:55,029 --> 00:15:56,650
SAS files and turns when the CSS files

442
00:15:56,650 --> 00:15:59,050
and compares them like if the stuff

443
00:15:59,050 --> 00:16:00,790
you've given the same sass file if

444
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:02,140
you're British the same CSS Ruby says

445
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:04,830
does you've passed so I call right easy

446
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:08,020
so a first step was creating a poor

447
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:10,300
quest like let's create all the all the

448
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:11,740
specs of the map functions the big map

449
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:13,209
API let's write all the specs we know

450
00:16:13,209 --> 00:16:16,560
it's going to work and this got merged

451
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,760
and like all right like getting stuff

452
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:20,649
motion up and sauce is hard so have a

453
00:16:20,649 --> 00:16:22,149
team wants like once your stuff that's

454
00:16:22,149 --> 00:16:25,209
pretty cool so getting that PR Matt

455
00:16:25,209 --> 00:16:27,459
merge made me feel really good like I

456
00:16:27,459 --> 00:16:28,899
admit I seem like a little giddy at the

457
00:16:28,899 --> 00:16:31,870
time was like wow this happened so it

458
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:33,550
gave me this rush of confidence and in

459
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:35,320
that moment I felt like this possible

460
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,440
maybe I can do this yeah

461
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:39,050
spicing is easy i got this this is this

462
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:42,200
good fun is easy now boys a doubt creeps

463
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,510
in and you're like they've put their

464
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:48,250
trust in you you better not screw up and

465
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:54,140
then it sinks in I didn't write C++ I I

466
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:58,490
turned SAS into CSS my cat walking on my

467
00:16:58,490 --> 00:17:01,450
keyboard could have mistakenly done this

468
00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:03,860
but it's okay I've got this has nothing

469
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:06,020
to lose like they're not expecting a

470
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:08,480
pull request like if I pull it off it'll

471
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:12,439
be a fantastic and surprising but what

472
00:17:12,439 --> 00:17:15,319
if the pr sucks what if they can tell

473
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:16,640
them afford immediately one of my shitty

474
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,810
code is out there for whole world to see

475
00:17:17,810 --> 00:17:23,480
forever we're not going to do i like all

476
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:25,850
rights so what if it sucks all right I

477
00:17:25,850 --> 00:17:27,949
tried they're good people they don't

478
00:17:27,949 --> 00:17:29,660
want it to help just do it I've talked

479
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:31,490
to them it's okay like it's all going to

480
00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:35,150
be all right so I'm going to get into

481
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:37,790
how I started so not knowing see I jump

482
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:38,900
into the code base and I figured all

483
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:40,910
right maps are kind of like lists like

484
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:42,830
we see in the purchase same thing so

485
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:43,910
I've just started throwing some code at

486
00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:46,700
the wall like let's see if it sticks so

487
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:49,040
this is our samples from original PR and

488
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:51,380
I out it take a short look just so you

489
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:52,400
can find the pattern what's going on

490
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:58,880
here it's a bit bit more of it don't

491
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:01,490
lean in the code but we can see they've

492
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:05,300
got bring in maps in here done it again

493
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:06,770
same kind of thing and this is what I

494
00:18:06,770 --> 00:18:08,780
call like CP DT this is a pattern that i

495
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:10,670
use to really get this sorted and what

496
00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:21,239
it is copy paste driven development like

497
00:18:21,249 --> 00:18:23,450
like we just take a short look like

498
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:25,789
anyway you saw the keyword map you saw

499
00:18:25,789 --> 00:18:27,740
the keyword list because maps are like

500
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:28,970
lists I figure if I can just make maps

501
00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:31,190
do a lister then what if i'm a bit let's

502
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:34,669
push the same thing the slight

503
00:18:34,669 --> 00:18:35,990
difference here is like you maps the

504
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:37,490
keys and values not just values like

505
00:18:37,490 --> 00:18:40,539
otherwise it's like two lists right

506
00:18:40,539 --> 00:18:43,269
let's move forward so the next one was a

507
00:18:43,269 --> 00:18:47,870
cedd so usually when you write code and

508
00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:49,639
you get an error like we've seen SAS let

509
00:18:49,639 --> 00:18:52,129
go you know it's out of it's out of

510
00:18:52,129 --> 00:18:53,269
bounds you've asked so a third element

511
00:18:53,269 --> 00:18:57,200
the recent third element yeah useful

512
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,869
error message you kind of find your code

513
00:18:58,869 --> 00:19:01,600
c++ when things go wrong things go wrong

514
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:05,419
look just like it's broken figure it out

515
00:19:05,419 --> 00:19:09,320
I'm like what am i doing how do I get

516
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:12,649
how I get pasta sick so go do this I

517
00:19:12,649 --> 00:19:14,419
discovered a sink with gdb which I just

518
00:19:14,419 --> 00:19:16,100
overflowed and just got a missed I know

519
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:17,779
three commands and three commands are

520
00:19:17,779 --> 00:19:20,029
always using that work every time but

521
00:19:20,029 --> 00:19:21,710
you some like this and it's like all

522
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:28,999
right all right okay sure I'm seeing OS

523
00:19:28,999 --> 00:19:31,490
some sink symbol I'm saying very scary

524
00:19:31,490 --> 00:19:34,669
words in there what have I broken

525
00:19:34,669 --> 00:19:45,790
whatever done yeah well 11

526
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:51,420
there and a half there it is so that's

527
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:53,370
the thing it's actually broken this

528
00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:54,840
tells me off somewhere in this print

529
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:56,940
thighs function is like an issue this is

530
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:58,410
the stack trace 'ok most languages to

531
00:19:58,410 --> 00:20:00,090
give you this is useful thing and you

532
00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:03,060
get there eventually a bit like yeah

533
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:05,880
it's still scary every time i see that i

534
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:08,640
kind of panic a bit so that's compilat

535
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,220
orange of development and I'm this is

536
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:13,520
because it is a compiled language like

537
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,810
it knows when things are wrong for the

538
00:20:15,810 --> 00:20:17,010
most part before they're actually wrong

539
00:20:17,010 --> 00:20:18,780
then kind of stopped you and if it

540
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:19,830
wasn't for this I don't think I ever

541
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:21,870
would have shipped my lips I stuff in

542
00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:23,160
the first place because I think I no

543
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:25,590
idea what I was doing this is like weeks

544
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:27,660
and weeks of work eventually had a pull

545
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:29,700
request had some help people I work with

546
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:34,040
who were great and uh so I did this and

547
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:37,410
Wow bye-bye a series of like unfortunate

548
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:38,850
and Portage's their behalf they merge

549
00:20:38,850 --> 00:20:42,000
this code and I product explicitly say

550
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,230
you probably should emerge this like

551
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:45,240
this is a start someone better than I am

552
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:47,100
can fix this but take what I've done

553
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:49,170
like I don't like I says they are don't

554
00:20:49,170 --> 00:20:52,470
write C C++ but they're excited who

555
00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:54,270
starts out like they wanted emerges to

556
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:55,620
go to that there's big pork quest people

557
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:57,030
really happy and it's a really big

558
00:20:57,030 --> 00:20:59,340
problem the big form was I'm terrible at

559
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:05,250
sea and so when we looked at while I was

560
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:06,390
writing the map functions i was riding

561
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:09,810
him like like two sets of lists if you

562
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:11,130
know a basic computer science a terrible

563
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:13,170
idea this is like the map get function

564
00:21:13,170 --> 00:21:14,970
turned to SAS but but sip athis code was

565
00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:16,920
doing it's like oh you have a map and a

566
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:19,080
key was looped through the entire map

567
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:20,460
each time find the key the matches bring

568
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:22,320
value back it's pretty naive we've all

569
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,990
done it before but this is crazy slower

570
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:27,720
this is terrible code and it was so slow

571
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:28,920
in the fact that thing the first

572
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:31,650
iteration was a couple orders magnitude

573
00:21:31,650 --> 00:21:34,560
slower than Ruby so no matter how fast c

574
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:35,700
is like there's no substitute for

575
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:38,670
terrible code so ox why they ship this

576
00:21:38,670 --> 00:21:41,430
and the thing is like performance as a

577
00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:45,510
feature to them nope i open an issue

578
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:46,560
saying like i know it was on this think

579
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:50,340
is terrible but uh wind up we have

580
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:51,930
multiple iterations i'm coming here is

581
00:21:51,930 --> 00:21:53,280
saying like I know why it's broken right

582
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:56,220
Darnell how to fix it and see an ad fix

583
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:57,460
it in JavaScript

584
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:59,470
took a bit of research and we file got a

585
00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:02,080
second PR and stuck down a third or

586
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,760
fourth iteration at this point it's like

587
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,860
lightning fast but one of the fastest

588
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:07,090
parts of lib sites like this map thing

589
00:22:07,090 --> 00:22:08,409
it's got a lot of work into it it's like

590
00:22:08,409 --> 00:22:10,240
a lot of work people perform me like

591
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,919
people who wrote really fussy libraries

592
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:14,940
and I bench alert had user api's and

593
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:17,649
it's perfect fit sure it's really

594
00:22:17,649 --> 00:22:19,149
important to us the community wanted

595
00:22:19,149 --> 00:22:20,679
maps they didn't care how fast they

596
00:22:20,679 --> 00:22:23,440
where it's much better use them so

597
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,820
 something like this this is

598
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:26,770
something like this this is
comparison of going around like lib SAS

599
00:22:26,770 --> 00:22:29,710
is two times slower than / CSS written

600
00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:32,529
in JavaScript I'm wearing C so we're

601
00:22:32,529 --> 00:22:33,610
doing special isn't really terribly

602
00:22:33,610 --> 00:22:34,690
wrong well they're just a really great

603
00:22:34,690 --> 00:22:37,090
engineering and like we know this we

604
00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:39,850
know it's slow it wasn't really

605
00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:41,470
concerned make it true phosphorus like

606
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:44,110
we're bring on the laurels of CC is fast

607
00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:45,669
so we'll be just be fast by having being

608
00:22:45,669 --> 00:22:47,679
in C and doesn't always work out but

609
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:48,850
like we give people the features they

610
00:22:48,850 --> 00:22:51,220
wanted so we've all seen stuff like this

611
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:53,919
and like we've all seen it in regards to

612
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:55,809
CSS but more accurately it's like things

613
00:22:55,809 --> 00:22:57,549
that don't understand I don't know how

614
00:22:57,549 --> 00:22:59,590
to do a thing it's painful like I don't

615
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:01,029
know what I'm doing was he yelling at me

616
00:23:01,029 --> 00:23:05,770
how do i fix this so yeah this is like

617
00:23:05,770 --> 00:23:07,809
the one of the new iterations and we can

618
00:23:07,809 --> 00:23:10,960
see in the previous version where like a

619
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,120
second or so slower than like rubies ass

620
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,610
and a new version I think this is the

621
00:23:15,610 --> 00:23:17,020
version we were actually equivalent we

622
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:18,730
got as fast as Ruby SAS was super

623
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:21,789
excited well I was because I fixed my

624
00:23:21,789 --> 00:23:24,010
terrible code so come around the tour

625
00:23:24,010 --> 00:23:29,130
2005 this is out there and um through

626
00:23:29,130 --> 00:23:31,270
continued continued poor decisions on

627
00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:34,840
behalf of Hampton I'm now one half of

628
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:38,080
the core team of lube SAS ah one-third

629
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:41,350
start an OC by the way we've added a new

630
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:42,279
contributor now which is really awesome

631
00:23:42,279 --> 00:23:44,679
the team is growing I'm most another

632
00:23:44,679 --> 00:23:46,630
project lead of nerd sauce which is a

633
00:23:46,630 --> 00:23:49,149
JavaScript project that's mostly see so

634
00:23:49,149 --> 00:23:50,590
that's the continuing theme I'm up here

635
00:23:50,590 --> 00:23:51,909
on stage in front of you all talking

636
00:23:51,909 --> 00:23:53,370
about how terrible em as a programmer

637
00:23:53,370 --> 00:23:56,440
but yes still a programmer and so I've

638
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:57,490
talked about these techniques for how

639
00:23:57,490 --> 00:23:58,929
you can take what you know in SAS and

640
00:23:58,929 --> 00:24:00,610
JavaScript and write like big boy stuff

641
00:24:00,610 --> 00:24:01,779
like C and see if I see not be afraid

642
00:24:01,779 --> 00:24:04,600
and like words a cheap so let's write

643
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:08,620
some code

644
00:24:08,630 --> 00:24:11,560
I sinner so we're going to write some

645
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:17,770
lips s today so yeah clap when it works

646
00:24:17,770 --> 00:24:21,110
so this is a compact function it's

647
00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:23,060
pretty simple or does the text takes a

648
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:28,040
list so we have a list here of we have a

649
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:29,840
list here of values you know some truth

650
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,190
you some folks who knows from JavaScript

651
00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:34,700
false is false null is false the guy

652
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:36,500
just takes this list now if you've

653
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:38,240
actually passed in a list having

654
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:39,380
personal issues return the list for

655
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:41,630
years like no up but it's going to loop

656
00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:43,340
through your list find things that

657
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:45,650
looked Ruthie add them to a new listing

658
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:47,150
return on your list it's like returning

659
00:24:47,150 --> 00:24:48,470
the stuff is probably Nolan didn't mean

660
00:24:48,470 --> 00:24:51,260
to have in the first place so that's

661
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:52,610
cool this is the SAS version of it and

662
00:24:52,610 --> 00:24:56,620
if we run it we can see it works like

663
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:59,930
false is gone and null is gone this is

664
00:24:59,930 --> 00:25:02,870
cool work turning SAS into c plus

665
00:25:02,870 --> 00:25:04,370
bhaskar and then executing that and

666
00:25:04,370 --> 00:25:06,620
bring back out SAS a super slow like we

667
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:08,660
want native methods run like this end

668
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:10,970
function like and these loops how fast

669
00:25:10,970 --> 00:25:14,230
these because they're in C++ so that's a

670
00:25:14,230 --> 00:25:16,670
let's bring some the c++ the way I would

671
00:25:16,670 --> 00:25:18,680
program obsess so if there's anyone here

672
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:21,380
who like who's bosses are controlled by

673
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:23,120
the youth lib toss not just they should

674
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:25,010
leave this is the house is how we write

675
00:25:25,010 --> 00:25:27,740
this covered it's not very personal way

676
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:31,040
to lose facing code right here so like

677
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:32,930
we could probably guess this thing is

678
00:25:32,930 --> 00:25:35,590
empty good functions as a functions file

679
00:25:35,590 --> 00:25:38,360
cool so the one thing we do know like

680
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:40,580
when I know a lot of sass so for me this

681
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:42,320
is kind of easy I know I need something

682
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:46,780
this is like a function called index so

683
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:49,870
if you look like index index is a

684
00:25:49,870 --> 00:25:51,860
function in SAS it's kind of like

685
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:54,020
finally we're in disarray this thing

686
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:57,140
happens let's keep looking where

687
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:59,330
anything's look like these that look

688
00:25:59,330 --> 00:26:04,820
around index function alright cool so we

689
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:07,820
can see this kind of looks like a texan

690
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:11,630
a list if the list is empty return the

691
00:26:11,630 --> 00:26:13,730
list sure we've done this before loop

692
00:26:13,730 --> 00:26:15,890
over the list if it equals x we pass the

693
00:26:15,890 --> 00:26:17,630
internet number cool that's kind of like

694
00:26:17,630 --> 00:26:18,809
some what we're doing we're looping over

695
00:26:18,809 --> 00:26:22,440
taking a list of returning a value what

696
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:24,240
we want to do we want to turn a list not

697
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,039
a number and that's similar to the

698
00:26:26,039 --> 00:26:27,120
append function which is actually right

699
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:30,629
here so what's this doing this is a lot

700
00:26:30,629 --> 00:26:32,480
of code let's talk about that right now

701
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,350
so it's like all right so we want

702
00:26:34,350 --> 00:26:36,809
something it's kind of like index so

703
00:26:36,809 --> 00:26:39,450
it's just copy and paste this we only

704
00:26:39,450 --> 00:26:41,730
wanted to call compact not index let's

705
00:26:41,730 --> 00:26:46,620
just a change that the compact we don't

706
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:47,759
want to value we just on the list so to

707
00:26:47,759 --> 00:26:51,749
get rid of the value all right so we

708
00:26:51,749 --> 00:26:55,009
just guess that this is creating a list

709
00:26:55,009 --> 00:26:58,249
we don't want value so they can go away

710
00:26:58,249 --> 00:27:03,840
so this means be sure cool so this is

711
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:08,580
comparing if the value at i equals the

712
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:09,600
value we passed it we don't have a

713
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:10,980
values obviously don't want this I

714
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:12,869
really want this like so what we're

715
00:27:12,869 --> 00:27:14,399
checking for is like existing truthy all

716
00:27:14,399 --> 00:27:15,629
right if it's truly you want it we don't

717
00:27:15,629 --> 00:27:20,100
so to your incest like is this true

718
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:23,779
right if this is true then do a thing so

719
00:27:23,779 --> 00:27:25,980
so such a stirring and number stop what

720
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:26,940
we want below if you see the pattern

721
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:29,039
here like it's very similar to our SAS

722
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:31,169
code of like loop through if do

723
00:27:31,169 --> 00:27:36,299
something return so in a pen just kind

724
00:27:36,299 --> 00:27:37,559
of like the list stuff we need right

725
00:27:37,559 --> 00:27:40,350
it's like results well you know result

726
00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:41,999
of same in every language that's thing

727
00:27:41,999 --> 00:27:44,039
we're returning so let's create one of

728
00:27:44,039 --> 00:27:49,289
those setting a length we don't know the

729
00:27:49,289 --> 00:27:50,369
lengths let's get rid of that just

730
00:27:50,369 --> 00:27:54,749
defaulted deserve sure whatever that

731
00:27:54,749 --> 00:27:58,830
means cool so what we need to do is add

732
00:27:58,830 --> 00:28:02,309
a new thing to list a like we know this

733
00:28:02,309 --> 00:28:03,389
is going to do this let's figure it out

734
00:28:03,389 --> 00:28:09,450
the odd thing to list sure it's probably

735
00:28:09,450 --> 00:28:12,960
going to work we don't have V but V is

736
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,029
this value right so let's just copy and

737
00:28:15,029 --> 00:28:19,619
paste that it's probably gonna work I'm

738
00:28:19,619 --> 00:28:21,210
gonna return the results like this part

739
00:28:21,210 --> 00:28:26,249
we know where programmers cool this

740
00:28:26,249 --> 00:28:27,779
looks like almost exactly like I'll SAS

741
00:28:27,779 --> 00:28:28,790
code

742
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:32,330
oh I miss one day I compact what I

743
00:28:32,330 --> 00:28:36,620
could've been bad I do have the license

744
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:38,150
but I upgraded and they doesn't work in

745
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:41,890
three-point oh my stuff's Birkin um sir

746
00:28:41,890 --> 00:28:44,210
all right let's run this again actually

747
00:28:44,210 --> 00:28:45,680
no it's not run graduate compile our

748
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:47,450
code so we're not grunt file or I'll

749
00:28:47,450 --> 00:28:53,120
make file that looks cool oh I compiled

750
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:58,880
did not expect that all right so comment

751
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,110
out our compact functions when we're

752
00:29:00,110 --> 00:29:06,680
using our code let's run it I'd save

753
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:14,500
that

754
00:29:14,510 --> 00:29:21,410
No

755
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:24,500
there we go so yeah it's spitting out

756
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:26,610
the word of compact which that we want

757
00:29:26,610 --> 00:29:27,750
it all so it actually not finding our

758
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:31,020
functions at all sorry I done something

759
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:33,660
wrong look our index function what's

760
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:36,360
this index sick sure that's a search

761
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:39,300
four letter code base ah there we go

762
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:44,180
we've missed some stuff all right turn

763
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:50,870
index into compact whereas we missed

764
00:29:50,870 --> 00:29:53,870
let's string index now we just did that

765
00:29:53,870 --> 00:30:03,030
yeah there we go stick your header files

766
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:10,690
all right it's Rick impalas o this ere

767
00:30:10,690 --> 00:30:16,230
drug development right in front so

768
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:19,720
contact all right so obviously there's a

769
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:21,250
thing called compact some wasn't exists

770
00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:23,860
but when our index exists so let's

771
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:28,930
search for index what do we missed these

772
00:30:28,930 --> 00:30:31,570
don't look right that's on the score

773
00:30:31,570 --> 00:30:46,899
index nope

774
00:30:46,909 --> 00:30:49,070
there we go you can tell us in their

775
00:30:49,070 --> 00:31:00,700
comeback in the earth

776
00:31:00,710 --> 00:31:04,920
let's do it hey no air is it compiled

777
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:06,600
but it hasn't done a thing we've noticed

778
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:09,240
like know what our folks is still there

779
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:12,810
why is false there obviously our if

780
00:31:12,810 --> 00:31:15,330
check isn't cutting it just go back to

781
00:31:15,330 --> 00:31:24,830
our code

782
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:30,610
it's the head of file right so I missing

783
00:31:30,610 --> 00:31:31,990
something here this if check is

784
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:33,220
obviously failing like things that are

785
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:35,440
folks are coming in true so it's like a

786
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:47,360
look for those oh how people doing false

787
00:31:47,370 --> 00:31:56,669
is false there we go now we're doing it

788
00:31:56,679 --> 00:32:05,200
so if this room is false we want if it's

789
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,549
really one if it's true right like it's

790
00:32:06,549 --> 00:32:20,649
not false yeah all right we've just C++

791
00:32:20,659 --> 00:32:22,979
wish it was a jerk that's how most of

792
00:32:22,979 --> 00:32:28,979
slips us gets written sir running out of

793
00:32:28,979 --> 00:32:30,929
time so we just come to today we have a

794
00:32:30,929 --> 00:32:32,999
new release loose ass coming out it is

795
00:32:32,999 --> 00:32:37,239
now the fast food processor out there

796
00:32:37,249 --> 00:32:40,709
we're now at a narrow after three major

797
00:32:40,709 --> 00:32:41,940
versions or almost a complete feature

798
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:43,919
parity the new version which is on this

799
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:45,179
list there should be a complete feature

800
00:32:45,179 --> 00:32:50,309
parity with some edge cases I can hang

801
00:32:50,309 --> 00:32:51,989
out with these great people this is a

802
00:32:51,989 --> 00:32:54,690
Hampton Chris like this thanks these

person who runs assassin does or

808
00:33:05,729 --> 00:33:07,799
language design for SAS and like I

809
00:33:07,799 --> 00:33:09,690
couldn't have done this like I would

810
00:33:09,690 --> 00:33:11,149
never put that PR up if I didn't think

811
00:33:11,149 --> 00:33:13,320
like that be supportive like having met

812
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:14,729
them before I having known the SS
