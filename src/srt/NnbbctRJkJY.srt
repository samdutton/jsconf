1
00:00:07,639 --> 00:00:11,490

my name is Tito and well I'm here to

2
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:13,740
talk about my personal story with

3
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:15,630
JavaScript it's also a personal story

4
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:17,340
with the people that I run both within

5
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:20,869
the JavaScript community so actually

6
00:00:20,869 --> 00:00:23,160
that I'm sending it with you I never

7
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:25,019
thought that will happen you know these

8
00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:26,699
days when you feel like you can run

9
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:29,539
through walls and we do crazy and

10
00:00:29,539 --> 00:00:32,279
don't care about it yeah I handed in

11
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:34,590
this proposal with lots of lots of typos

12
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:37,200
and never thought I were here today and

13
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,540
yeah the unexpected happens so I'm here

14
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:43,800
today and I'm very excited and i hope to

15
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:47,899
give you a nicer storytelling talk so

16
00:00:47,899 --> 00:00:52,320
one thing there will be bad JavaScript a

17
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,100
hat I mean really really bad JavaScript

18
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:59,430
so if you can't stand it you better go

19
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:04,850
now so let's start with my story in 1999

20
00:01:04,850 --> 00:01:08,460
to give you the perspective what 99 9

21
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:11,700
was like you know our smart phones right

22
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:16,530
now imagine no color no more cheering

23
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:22,490
Jones no no connectivity besides gsm

24
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:26,850
monochrome display and like this and

25
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:31,950
this this is 90 99 this was also when

26
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:35,100
NASA was found it so well it's really

27
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:40,790
long time ago so this is me in 1999 and

28
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:44,040
the theater it's called a goatee and

29
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:48,119
thus Cody put me right into the

30
00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:50,430
questionable end of the trustworthiness

31
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:53,159
of beards Gail and I did questionable

32
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:57,090
things with JavaScript this is my

33
00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:01,890
JavaScript from 1999 when you look at it

34
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:03,990
I maybe make it a little bit more

35
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:08,429
smaller better um you can probably tell

36
00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:12,450
what it does this how I apply it

37
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:24,000
and this is oh great okay this page

38
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,340
doesn't scale but basically this is what

39
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:29,430
it does you go over an element I hacked

40
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:32,599
it up with my pirated copy of 3d max

41
00:02:32,599 --> 00:02:35,420
anybody could you go through the door

42
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:37,830
amazing right this is what i use

43
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:42,709
javascript for a 90 99 and where is my

44
00:02:42,709 --> 00:02:51,870
presentation hmm it's gone so let's

45
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:55,349
start again okay the technology is not

46
00:02:55,349 --> 00:03:06,299
kind of me today so let's move forward

47
00:03:06,299 --> 00:03:13,459
2003 so 2003 was the year then matrix

48
00:03:13,459 --> 00:03:16,319
revolution was released the third part

49
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:20,400
of a probably very cool first part but

50
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,040
it goes down from there right or anybody

51
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,510
thought that bed was better than the

52
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:29,040
first part know right exactly and there

53
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,680
was well 2003 and my nationals first

54
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,329
part I couldn't wait to be up for the

55
00:03:33,329 --> 00:03:37,380
other parts well this is me in 2003 i

56
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:40,799
get rid of the beard so i stopped done

57
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:42,900
questionable things with javascript well

58
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:46,980
mostly because i moved on to work for

59
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:50,040
caesar wrap and a speedo match besides

60
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:54,420
studying computer science so let's means

61
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:56,099
also i haven't much to do with

62
00:03:56,099 --> 00:04:00,450
javascript on the usual stateless web

63
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:04,049
application stuff because don't have to

64
00:04:04,049 --> 00:04:09,019
care of it asp.net with fuse days so I

65
00:04:09,019 --> 00:04:12,299
had a nice a te with lots of distracting

66
00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:17,519
detailed and well this is the view stage

67
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:20,070
so basically just encoded every state on

68
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:21,579
a verification in a very

69
00:04:21,579 --> 00:04:22,960
and send us every post that is

70
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,819
manipulated on the server and then sent

71
00:04:24,819 --> 00:04:29,129
back well I get some JavaScript as well

72
00:04:29,129 --> 00:04:31,479
this is JavaScript from two thousand

73
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:36,370
four three what it does is ordering a

74
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:41,740
list so this function I just show you a

75
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:46,270
part of it was 64 lines long had four

76
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:48,939
four loops in it and six if statements

77
00:04:48,939 --> 00:04:55,419
so you can imagine quite complex so this

78
00:04:55,419 --> 00:05:02,889
is where needed it for for to select the

79
00:05:02,889 --> 00:05:04,479
entries I selected from one site and

80
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:05,590
move it to the other side of the list

81
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:08,770
that's all it does but that's how i did

82
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:11,500
it in 2003 and actually this is my first

83
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:14,789
serious web application it was used to

84
00:05:14,789 --> 00:05:17,860
search for multi resistant pathogens in

85
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:19,960
hospitals so it was quite serious stuff

86
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:23,110
it was really fun also yeah I had to

87
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:26,409
work with the net but well let's move on

88
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:31,419
to 2006 in 2006 I grew me a full beard

89
00:05:31,419 --> 00:05:35,919
and long here so the thing with foo bit

90
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:37,690
is it puts you on the very trustworthy

91
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:41,680
end of the scale and yes obviously it

92
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,900
helps because this charming guy in the

93
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:46,300
middle is Alex he asked me back then if

94
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:48,069
I want to run a company with him and I

95
00:05:48,069 --> 00:05:50,319
said well why not I have nothing else to

96
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:53,440
do I just when you're studying so we

97
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,909
found a company called a stream and

98
00:05:54,909 --> 00:05:58,599
throw a stream and Alex I came to rails

99
00:05:58,599 --> 00:06:02,199
and Ruby so rubios is all I do for

100
00:06:02,199 --> 00:06:04,500
living but you won't see much Ruby today

101
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:08,319
and I also move from the IDE to an

102
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:12,190
editor so much less clutter much more

103
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:17,020
basic and well with Ruby and rails there

104
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:19,240
was prototype Jess and I first of all

105
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,940
Wow cool all these nice objects and I

106
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:24,879
know how to do that and the crew from

107
00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:28,000
Los also prototype came with some lights

108
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,649
and little helpers so that you actually

109
00:06:29,649 --> 00:06:32,099
don't have to program any JavaScript

110
00:06:32,099 --> 00:06:34,120
because you just have to call

111
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:36,699
Ruby message and the build JavaScript

112
00:06:36,699 --> 00:06:39,580
for you of course right into your mother

113
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:45,790
I mean this is still readable but if you

114
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:47,350
want to do something more complex and

115
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:50,020
you want to use Ruby to build something

116
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:52,650
this prototype it ended up like this so

117
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:55,990
this is a mixture of Ruby method calls

118
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:58,600
and javascript in between and it

119
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,850
basically built an implied click in

120
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:06,610
place selectable date selector well when

121
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:08,050
I looked at the club later and had to

122
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:13,960
update it is it was a help but sometimes

123
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:18,010
later I also came to jQuery and jQuery

124
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:21,430
was like oh cool because it was so easy

125
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:25,389
to access the dumb right you you have

126
00:07:25,389 --> 00:07:28,150
this nice lecture syntax CSS selectors

127
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:29,680
you know then a little bit you don't

128
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,110
move it so I is also improved my CSS

129
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:36,070
skills oh yeah okay there are not much

130
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:38,139
not much skills but anyway and the coop

131
00:07:38,139 --> 00:07:39,789
you could chain it and chain it and

132
00:07:39,789 --> 00:07:42,039
Shane it and Shane it and chain it and

133
00:07:42,039 --> 00:07:45,039
chain another really messy code if you

134
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:47,410
just go with it and have no idea what to

135
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:53,260
do that's me 2006 2007 2008 around this

136
00:07:53,260 --> 00:08:01,000
time so 2009 that was ten years

137
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,590
basically ignoring javascript i used it

138
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:09,880
i had with me all the time but actually

139
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:13,419
I never really really used in the

140
00:08:13,419 --> 00:08:18,389
serious way but that change then that's

141
00:08:18,389 --> 00:08:23,349
the end thanks to Sammy Jess Erin thank

142
00:08:23,349 --> 00:08:29,710
you for that and mustache I could use

143
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:33,180
something I'm familiar with from rails

144
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:38,770
basically I have routes I have a I have

145
00:08:38,770 --> 00:08:41,529
a model I have a template that was

146
00:08:41,529 --> 00:08:44,320
something familiar that and I used model

147
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,860
view controller okay I don't

148
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:48,829
thousand times Indra in rails so I build

149
00:08:48,829 --> 00:08:51,320
my little first little seriously semi

150
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:55,820
application but they're small that

151
00:08:55,820 --> 00:09:00,380
happens in 2009 basically this this guy

152
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:04,040
young I have the pleasure to know for a

153
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,540
very long time because you was one of

154
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:06,980
the first co-workers in a co-working

155
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:11,060
space and rod J has come to Europe with

156
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:14,570
jazz come to you which in 2009 cause a

157
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:17,120
lot of commotion because Ryan introduced

158
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:21,200
noche as her server site or it wasn't

159
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,839
the first but like the widely recognized

160
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:28,339
server side chairs and the funny thing

161
00:09:28,339 --> 00:09:32,480
is Ryan road no dress also because he

162
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,910
was frustrated working on the app web

163
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:37,220
server for ubi because we could couldn't

164
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:38,570
get so much performance out of it

165
00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:40,279
because ruby was always blocking on

166
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:45,200
something so you see there's a

167
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:50,079
connection everywhere so let's move on

168
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:56,060
2010 so that was good the last year so

169
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:58,640
in 2010 they want to first this guy

170
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:04,220
Bobin organized the first javascript

171
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:06,470
user group in berlin and right from the

172
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:08,449
start we became the biggest user group

173
00:10:08,449 --> 00:10:12,110
um we asked a lot of user groups in our

174
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:14,269
space and they're the guys that

175
00:10:14,269 --> 00:10:17,360
constantly go of our capacity right from

176
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:22,550
the beginning and there I heard Felix

177
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:26,810
talking about no jazz in more detail so

178
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:28,670
that was my first real contact with no

179
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:30,050
just because I didn't attend the first

180
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:37,050
day of school and I was really impressed

181
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:41,240
what their what they done there and with

182
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:44,120
all the other methods to easily work

183
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:50,740
with file system and alls I all stuff

184
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,750
throughout the year there are more

185
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:56,480
JavaScript's events that influence min

186
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:59,210
away and impressed me there was the Jays

187
00:10:59,210 --> 00:11:05,060
1k contest ok let's try again to switch

188
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:10,610
the tabs they had lasers there and I was

189
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:12,590
really impressed with it lasers for

190
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:19,630
everybody accessible through the web and

191
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:22,310
somebody actually brought wrote a jump

192
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:30,770
run in 1200 1024 bytes actually 23 you

193
00:11:30,770 --> 00:11:34,790
see that way and corner that was Marcin

194
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:37,030
who yesterday talked about dumb

195
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:41,960
optimization and he actually handcrafted

196
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:45,740
his code so he doesn't doesn't use the

197
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:48,080
closure compiler to minimize his coat he

198
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,850
does it all by hand and he beats the

199
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:55,280
compiler it's like there was well for me

200
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:59,000
it was really impressive and yeah a very

201
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:06,260
creative use so I don't know why this

202
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:12,230
windows always disappear are they

203
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:13,910
somewhere down here no they just

204
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:23,750
disappear this is not very helpful

205
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:33,640
so let's jump forward yes this is how

206
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,500
his coat looked like minimize this is

207
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:43,330
the jump and run so and I did my first

208
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:46,240
series mostly JavaScript project in them

209
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:50,140
and I did it with Robin and oh I have to

210
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:52,990
switch tops again so we will use loose

211
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:59,230
again what it does is oh we can scale

212
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:06,490
this I'm creelo th oh no Shh okay let's

213
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:11,920
give this so huh but this works okay

214
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:18,010
nice time so it was a vector-based font

215
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:20,560
editor where you can make nice ones

216
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,060
directly in the browser you had a

217
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:23,980
selection of phones and you can style

218
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:26,220
them and they're automatically Iraq

219
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:29,830
aligned and for this I used Raphael

220
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:32,350
which back then was already a great

221
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:33,970
library because it was easy to use and

222
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:35,590
I'm very happy now that there's an

223
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:37,950
update what we probably will incorporate

224
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:46,120
in this project so this is one part of

225
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:48,940
the code there and you see we have a

226
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:51,010
namespace we have something like a real

227
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:55,450
object there so things that make sense

228
00:13:55,450 --> 00:13:58,270
and I kind of understand how to

229
00:13:58,270 --> 00:14:00,600
structure my code to do something

230
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:03,340
juniors project i also bought the book

231
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:05,880
that helped me very much with javascript

232
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:09,070
javascript patterns it was like 220

233
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:12,790
pages and i'm like for me I usually only

234
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:14,800
buy books that are around 200 pages

235
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,300
because I'm they're more they usually

236
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:19,090
have too much erotic and I want to have

237
00:14:19,090 --> 00:14:20,710
compact and it helped me really to

238
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:23,590
understand a lot of things that right

239
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:26,890
now will probably seem trivial for you

240
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:29,350
like if you if you call new it's

241
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:31,450
basically nothing else than assigning

242
00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:34,279
you object this formula

243
00:14:34,279 --> 00:14:36,980
okay then I know how to build function

244
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:38,569
without where I don't have to call you

245
00:14:38,569 --> 00:14:40,699
all the time or it doesn't matter if I

246
00:14:40,699 --> 00:14:44,329
con you and yeah things like self

247
00:14:44,329 --> 00:14:46,699
calling functions and well if you if

248
00:14:46,699 --> 00:14:48,199
you're really thing about it like

249
00:14:48,199 --> 00:14:51,439
obvious and of course the whole scope

250
00:14:51,439 --> 00:14:54,709
and context thing which I hadn't dressed

251
00:14:54,709 --> 00:15:01,910
entirely but mostly so another jess

252
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:06,290
conference and this time i attended and

253
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:07,759
i was impressed because there are so

254
00:15:07,759 --> 00:15:10,999
many different kind of people and talks

255
00:15:10,999 --> 00:15:13,699
from game engine over something with

256
00:15:13,699 --> 00:15:20,410
html5 and forms and no SQL solutions and

257
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:24,589
well this crazy guy iconic javascript

258
00:15:24,589 --> 00:15:29,629
maniac showtek j s and this was a really

259
00:15:29,629 --> 00:15:32,089
creative use of the syntax of JavaScript

260
00:15:32,089 --> 00:15:35,839
and using streams some of you might

261
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:38,149
still remember I still haven't got my

262
00:15:38,149 --> 00:15:39,949
head around it I looked into the code I

263
00:15:39,949 --> 00:15:42,079
understand the details but I hadn't

264
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:44,149
clicked yet so this is my challenge to

265
00:15:44,149 --> 00:15:46,759
understand this really like really

266
00:15:46,759 --> 00:15:49,160
uh-huh I see this is how it works all

267
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:51,829
together I mean kibo told me what it

268
00:15:51,829 --> 00:15:54,199
does a nice understand but I don't see

269
00:15:54,199 --> 00:15:58,400
it in the call yet

270
00:15:58,410 --> 00:16:01,410
and of course it was extremely funny

271
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:04,470
with hanging out with people but sorry

272
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:07,620
no photos if you missed that we have

273
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:12,060
another chance this year so this year we

274
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:16,410
coming to an end this was a really

275
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:20,629
exciting year first there was another

276
00:16:20,629 --> 00:16:23,970
villain Jess meet up that was very

277
00:16:23,970 --> 00:16:26,819
impressive and the funny thing for me is

278
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:28,649
I don't have to move to the meetups

279
00:16:28,649 --> 00:16:30,449
because they are always taking place in

280
00:16:30,449 --> 00:16:35,420
my place in my office not at my place

281
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:41,639
well and their dad showed 140 bites the

282
00:16:41,639 --> 00:16:44,579
talk that was just downstairs and this

283
00:16:44,579 --> 00:16:47,810
was another great example of creative

284
00:16:47,810 --> 00:16:52,410
use of the language and like show me all

285
00:16:52,410 --> 00:16:56,220
the edges and possibilities that are in

286
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:58,800
there that are not that obvious and like

287
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:02,490
documented so I'm happy to do that

288
00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:05,669
because it shows another side of the

289
00:17:05,669 --> 00:17:08,549
language that otherwise would be hidden

290
00:17:08,549 --> 00:17:13,120
if it wouldn't be for this project oh

291
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:17,039
and I also could spend some money on

292
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:20,459
another conference this is what may the

293
00:17:20,459 --> 00:17:23,130
european ruby conference that i have

294
00:17:23,130 --> 00:17:25,470
organizing and the great experience

295
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:29,370
there was that you cojiro matomoto this

296
00:17:29,370 --> 00:17:33,440
is the guy smiling with the glasses is

297
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:36,990
inventor of ruby and he was talking with

298
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:40,770
Felix and Josie valima coke meter of

299
00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:42,900
rails and one of the organizers and they

300
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:44,970
are talking about just talking about

301
00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:46,350
tech stuff and there was no I'm

302
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:48,720
Unversity and there was so much exchange

303
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,000
and I really like well we're a big

304
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,039
community and it actually doesn't matter

305
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:57,919
if you do javascript or PHP a ruby

306
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:00,690
everybody just cared about having fun

307
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:05,400
and doing something creative so that was

308
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:08,890
it was a really nice conference for me

309
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:11,030
followed by another one just a week

310
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:14,480
later you see the note can be you in

311
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:19,250
Cologne where I first time saw Ryan down

312
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:24,440
and actually presenting and he wrote a

313
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:27,680
web server with C and showed how you you

314
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:31,670
slippery for that and what impressed me

315
00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:35,060
there was how he does that he did live

316
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:38,840
coding and when I looked at him he was

317
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:41,870
like smiling and gleaming eyes and for

318
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:43,400
me the pieces are like he was a child

319
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,370
he's just playing with the possibilities

320
00:18:45,370 --> 00:18:51,440
so there was no it was just ease there

321
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,750
was nothing in between it was just like

322
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:56,990
playing with possibilities and and does

323
00:18:56,990 --> 00:19:03,500
in this raw level of see well and I gave

324
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,660
coffee strippers spinning at the same

325
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:09,160
time and when I looked at it even oh

326
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:13,850
this looks very much like Ruby so there

327
00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:16,040
was like another closing gap Ruby

328
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:20,320
JavaScript the lines blur more and more

329
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:26,140
and fast forward to three days ago

330
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:31,910
reject yes and there Felix said

331
00:19:31,910 --> 00:19:36,560
something that sums up I should sum up

332
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:42,110
or a notion of what we actually do and

333
00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:45,560
he said well basically javascript is

334
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:48,800
just duct tape for the web node is duct

335
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:53,630
tape for parallelism or not blocking not

336
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:58,700
pal ism and so now I'm here speaking in

337
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:04,010
front of you at JS conf and EMS Krypton

338
00:20:04,010 --> 00:20:06,710
is running Ruby Ruby is running

339
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:10,550
JavaScript to read through v8 and we are

340
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:13,610
all having fun everybody does what he

341
00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:16,280
likes is creative so for me it's all

342
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:18,419
like double rainbows

343
00:20:18,419 --> 00:20:27,260
and unicorns thank you very much
