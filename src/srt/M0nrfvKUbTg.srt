00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:11,820

solo everybody um welcome to JS conf

2
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:14,759
2011 it's awesome thanks for the or

3
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:17,400
thanks to organizers and Malta and yon

4
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,560
and holger for having me here and

5
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:21,600
everyone else who's helped out Berlin's

6
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,340
an awesome city so thank you to everyone

7
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:26,070
who lives here for showing us all a good

8
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:31,740
time so prologue let's talk about making

9
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:34,559
lasers for a bit when I was a little kid

10
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:40,320
I I wasn't pleased with video games or

11
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,379
anything I really got her harass my

12
00:00:43,379 --> 00:00:45,450
parents constantly and I would always

13
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:47,250
come to them and be like I want to make

14
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:49,140
something I don't want to just do

15
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:50,960
something I want to make something and

16
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:56,309
so the stories that I found anything I

17
00:00:56,309 --> 00:00:58,920
could find my house would kabul them

18
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,140
together into like the weirdest arrays

19
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:03,510
of what i called robots or lasers and

20
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:05,430
basically laser was a flashlight and a

21
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:08,220
mirror and a prism and old telegraphic

22
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:10,409
photo lens that focus light and i

23
00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:11,700
thought it was the coolest thing ever

24
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:16,350
and it was all strapped to like it was

25
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:18,420
strapped to my job just a big wooden

26
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:20,610
board and that was that was that was

27
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:23,549
making something that was me then you

28
00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:26,729
can check out my sweet awesome Beethoven

29
00:01:26,729 --> 00:01:29,130
the movie long sleeve shirt because

30
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:31,409
that's how cool I was um that's my

31
00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:35,790
little brother too so quickly about me

32
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:40,079
I'm the Sami guy if you recognize where

33
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:42,530
the source pictures from you get a beer

34
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:45,659
I'm the CTO of a company in the u.s.

35
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:47,220
called paperless post we do online

36
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:50,299
invitations and stationery we have a

37
00:01:50,299 --> 00:01:52,799
pretty large team in a pretty large app

38
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:54,689
and we're growing pretty quickly but

39
00:01:54,689 --> 00:01:56,340
thanks to them I'm out here and can talk

40
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:00,840
to you guys I'm the lover of food the

41
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,579
lover of food i'm a lover of food i

42
00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:04,740
start a thing called code food bar if

43
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:07,799
any of you guys came on friday night

44
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:08,440
last night

45
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:10,570
to the dinner that was actually I did

46
00:02:10,570 --> 00:02:12,130
nothing for that that was all Tiffany

47
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:15,460
and we can thank her for that but I

48
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:17,800
started a thing we're nerds get together

49
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,990
and eat because I like eating better

50
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:22,480
than I like drinking to be honest but

51
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,180
when you combine combine them both you

52
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:28,420
know that's the real magic so today's

53
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:31,480
talk the title changed a little bit it's

54
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:33,010
called your framework sucks and so does

55
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:35,500
mine but it's going to be a little bit

56
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:39,160
of a rant and a little bit of maybe some

57
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:43,810
knowledge will be transmitted so I'm

58
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:45,820
going to go over kind of myths and

59
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:48,070
truths of frameworks and specifically

60
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:50,260
client-side web frameworks and what that

61
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:55,080
means so there are a couple minutes that

62
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,830
that come up when you talk about

63
00:02:56,830 --> 00:02:58,600
client-side frameworks and they mainly

64
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:01,210
revolve around like creation myths and

65
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:03,730
then like propagation myths like

66
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:06,100
creation myths as in how these things

67
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:08,020
sprain works came about and came into

68
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:10,000
being and propagation myths like how

69
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,470
they became popular and how why they

70
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:14,200
should be popular so probably the

71
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:17,670
biggest one is emitted extraction and

72
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:20,170
you know it's it's a real myth because

73
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:22,060
frameworks aren't like these immaculate

74
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:23,739
conceptions they're not like all of a

75
00:03:23,739 --> 00:03:25,810
sudden there was an act and then out of

76
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:27,850
this app sprung this framework the

77
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:29,470
greatest framework that ever that was

78
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:34,750
ever created and the the you know the

79
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:37,470
most popular myth is probably rails and

80
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:41,980
or so Molina gave a talk at i think it

81
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:43,840
was scottish Ruby come two years ago

82
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,880
where he talked about kind of actually

83
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:49,390
went through all the in a very very

84
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:51,760
nerdy in like comic book guy way went

85
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,459
through all the the mailing list

86
00:03:54,459 --> 00:03:57,550
archives of Ruby laying around the time

87
00:03:57,550 --> 00:03:59,500
that rails was released and it was

88
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,660
really really obvious that base camp was

89
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:03,050
happening and rails

90
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:05,630
happening but it wasn't like base camp

91
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:07,520
and then pull the rails at a base camp

92
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:10,850
that just didn't happen they frameworks

93
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:12,410
grow they don't just spring out of

94
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:14,900
nothing and frameworks what they really

95
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:17,390
are like combinations of a couple things

96
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:21,590
abstractions like trying to pull common

97
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:24,980
things into abstract patterns that can

98
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:28,850
be reused tools like generators and

99
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:32,780
stuff like that patterns actual not not

100
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:36,590
forcing you into a pattern or or not the

101
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:37,790
abstractions of the patterns themselves

102
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:42,500
but just patterns like MVC and M vvvvvv

103
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:46,760
c and stuff like that also frameworks

104
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,170
can also be combinations of existing

105
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:51,140
frameworks and a lot of JavaScript

106
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:52,880
frameworks these days the bigger ones

107
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:55,310
are built on top of jQuery or combined

108
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:58,370
jquery and something else to make the

109
00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:00,530
new framework what they also are

110
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:04,870
experiments in the framework that I

111
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:08,390
created in what really brings me here

112
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:11,060
today is Sammy J guess and Sammy jess

113
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:13,100
was really I'm not going to lie I didn't

114
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:15,800
extract it out of some awesome app that

115
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,360
i wrote it really was just an experiment

116
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,350
it was can we take something like

117
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:23,600
Sinatra which is a ruby framework that I

118
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,430
really loved and was super simple and

119
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:27,380
translated to the web and translated

120
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:31,520
into JavaScript so this is what a

121
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,840
Sinatra application looks like you don't

122
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:34,820
need to know Ruby to read this but

123
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:36,770
basically you define an app that's just

124
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:39,050
a you know a class that descends from

125
00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:40,940
Sinatra application and you define a

126
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:43,520
route which is a path and then what

127
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,410
happens in that route where you render

128
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:47,780
the index temper it's really really

129
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:50,240
simple so this is what it looks like

130
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,490
insanity I mean the original original

131
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:54,620
sketches for Sammy were literally just a

132
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:56,210
gist I could probably point people that

133
00:05:56,210 --> 00:05:59,780
just but it was like you know since ruby

134
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:02,510
has blocks and JavaScript has these this

135
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:04,669
call back or you know first class

136
00:06:04,669 --> 00:06:06,980
function pattern we can do some similar

137
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:08,630
things and hey maybe this could be

138
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:10,520
interesting maybe this could have use

139
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:13,490
cases beyond just an experiment and

140
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:15,930
actually it was Alex over

141
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:18,030
standing next to me who realized that

142
00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:20,660
hey this pattern of having a controller

143
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:23,400
is really useful for things like couchdb

144
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,440
where you don't have necessarily have a

145
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,900
middle tier and you can just have Sammy

146
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,940
and this controller pattern living

147
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:32,310
completely in the browser and living

148
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:34,590
just in the database itself and I talked

149
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:37,259
about that last year but it's a really

150
00:06:37,259 --> 00:06:38,850
interesting pattern in it's not

151
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:40,350
something that I initially thought of as

152
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:42,419
a use case for Sammy but it ended up

153
00:06:42,419 --> 00:06:46,259
being the best use case so another myth

154
00:06:46,259 --> 00:06:49,680
is smaller is better and this is kind of

155
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,440
a recent one and I'll have to like fist

156
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:55,080
fight with Jed about this but basically

157
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:59,789
the myth is that you know it doesn't I

158
00:06:59,789 --> 00:07:01,590
mean obviously obviously there are

159
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:04,560
reasons to have small code especially on

160
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,020
the on the client side it does actually

161
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:11,190
matter but the myth that it matters for

162
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:14,880
most is is kind of ridiculous most

163
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,500
people cite the need for speed you know

164
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:20,340
that that you know were you know

165
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:21,720
obviously we're downloading all the code

166
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,580
in the browser so the smaller your code

167
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:26,370
is the faster it'll be are the faster

168
00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:29,010
download but really were most people are

169
00:07:29,010 --> 00:07:31,080
running I mean most developers at least

170
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,010
are probably running on high-speed

171
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:34,349
connections and the difference between a

172
00:07:34,349 --> 00:07:37,530
kilobyte or two really really once its

173
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:39,300
cache is not really going to make that

174
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:41,430
big a difference and what ends up

175
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:44,220
happening is people extract so much of

176
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:45,930
the coro that they really end up with

177
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:47,639
less when you're going to take stuff

178
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:49,500
away you take stuff away obviously

179
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:50,520
there's a point where you can actually

180
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,409
refactor stuff and make stuff smaller

181
00:07:52,409 --> 00:07:53,610
and make it faster and make it better

182
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:55,289
when you're actually taking a whole

183
00:07:55,289 --> 00:07:57,180
chunks out of a framework or whole

184
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:59,729
chunks out of out of an existing tool

185
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:02,669
you're probably losing some stuff and

186
00:08:02,669 --> 00:08:05,009
that stuff you might end up having to

187
00:08:05,009 --> 00:08:08,340
recreate and create your own version of

188
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:09,840
it which might not be as good as the

189
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,870
original version so less actually means

190
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:14,520
lessons smaller doesn't always mean

191
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:18,080
better really it's about balance and

192
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:21,030
balance is a couple things but here I'm

193
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:22,050
talking about readability and

194
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:24,240
maintainability versus the lines of code

195
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,889
so you know you can

196
00:08:25,889 --> 00:08:28,469
right everything in 140 bites you can

197
00:08:28,469 --> 00:08:30,930
write your entire web framework in the

198
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:33,810
length of a in the length of a quick an

199
00:08:33,810 --> 00:08:35,550
endlave within the length of a tweet but

200
00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:38,459
really that's not gonna you know if you

201
00:08:38,459 --> 00:08:41,070
actually oh now we want to add support

202
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:45,420
for you know actual hash hash matching

203
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:48,149
or or some other kind of patterns like

204
00:08:48,149 --> 00:08:50,459
oh how am I actually going to go in and

205
00:08:50,459 --> 00:08:55,140
do that so you know there is has to be

206
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:56,490
some kind of ballast and i'm not talking

207
00:08:56,490 --> 00:09:00,149
about like naming all your methods you

208
00:09:00,149 --> 00:09:03,930
know does connect to device so that it

209
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:05,790
can you know there's there's a balance

210
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:08,730
there's a balance and the readability is

211
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:10,290
truly important especially if you're

212
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:13,529
working with the team for the speed

213
00:09:13,529 --> 00:09:14,820
demons for the people who actually do

214
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:16,560
care about speed and not only care about

215
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,630
speed but it's of utmost importance i

216
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:22,740
spelled require wrong they their code

217
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:24,449
loaders like lap dance and require which

218
00:09:24,449 --> 00:09:26,040
allow you to load stopping is

219
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,570
synchronously so you don't have to load

220
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:29,430
everything and you can just load you can

221
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:30,959
split up your code base you only load

222
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:32,940
the things you need and of course we all

223
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:35,220
know compilation the compression you can

224
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:36,779
compress your code after the fat and

225
00:09:36,779 --> 00:09:38,370
there are tools that you can use to do

226
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:39,839
that in their ways you can write code

227
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:41,640
that's still readable but compress as

228
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:46,110
well so you know that those are two

229
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:47,910
important things also component ization

230
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:51,240
like only taking what you need from a

231
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:54,209
framework in making framework small

232
00:09:54,209 --> 00:09:55,860
enough so that you can basically split

233
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:57,899
them up and obviously ender is probably

234
00:09:57,899 --> 00:10:00,570
the newest example of something that's

235
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:02,519
completely componentized so that you

236
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:05,540
only really need to take what you need

237
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:08,550
so this is more of our where we go into

238
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:11,100
more of a rant section but there's kind

239
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:14,070
of this myth that's not specific client

240
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:15,720
side frame works at all but this myth of

241
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:18,930
the one true way and the funny thing is

242
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:20,310
that the truth about everything is that

243
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:23,160
there is no one truth I don't know who

244
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:26,220
said this no one I said it no I mean

245
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:28,140
there it's someone much greater than me

246
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:30,120
realize this a very long time ago

247
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,279
probably when they were arguing with

248
00:10:32,279 --> 00:10:35,050
someone in a cave about how big

249
00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:37,740
mammoth was or something like that but

250
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:41,320
the truth is if there is no one truth

251
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:43,209
and that's kind of a Taoist philosophy

252
00:10:43,209 --> 00:10:45,970
but you know there there there is a path

253
00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:47,260
and there are things that are better

254
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:48,820
than others but it's really case-by-case

255
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:51,880
and this idea that frameworks have

256
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:55,209
become these religions that just boggles

257
00:10:55,209 --> 00:10:56,860
my mind that people can believe in

258
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:58,870
something so much that they're willing

259
00:10:58,870 --> 00:11:01,029
to sacrifice all out and Ellison really

260
00:11:01,029 --> 00:11:03,640
be zealots for a for a for a framework

261
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:08,589
it's kind of crazy so the way this the

262
00:11:08,589 --> 00:11:10,750
way you express this is by saying I'm a

263
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:13,450
rails developer or I'm a backbone

264
00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:15,310
developer or on my sami developer I'm a

265
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:18,010
no developer obviously there are

266
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:19,450
differences between platforms and

267
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:21,579
frameworks but at the baseline tying

268
00:11:21,579 --> 00:11:23,290
yourself to a single anything and

269
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:26,170
labeling yourself like that you know

270
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:30,550
really makes it so that no one can talk

271
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:32,170
to you and there you have only have this

272
00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:34,240
one frame of reference and I'm this and

273
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,370
everyone else's other and it's not it's

274
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:39,070
not really a good way to live the basic

275
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:40,810
thing is that there is no untrue so

276
00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:42,520
you're all wrong but you're also all

277
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:46,630
right so if we all agree that there is

278
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:48,850
no untrue that we can all agree that we

279
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:51,579
can all have coexisting opinions about

280
00:11:51,579 --> 00:11:54,070
how things work obviously certain things

281
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:55,450
are true and certain things are faster

282
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:57,070
and certain things are slower but it

283
00:11:57,070 --> 00:11:59,529
really is a case-by-case basis and what

284
00:11:59,529 --> 00:12:00,850
I'm trying to say is that altruism

285
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:02,230
doesn't really belong in web development

286
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:05,230
there's a reason we have different tools

287
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:06,940
and people will use different tools and

288
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:08,740
the idea that we tie ourselves to a

289
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:10,300
single tool and keep pushing that

290
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:13,180
forward makes us not open to the rest of

291
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:15,310
the world and excludes people and that's

292
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:16,690
that's the worst thing you can possibly

293
00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:20,079
do so I'm not even talking about being

294
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:22,390
framework agnostic but just be agnostic

295
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:25,240
in general and that doesn't mean in a

296
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,770
religious sense that means questioning

297
00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:29,070
things you know so it's okay that

298
00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:31,360
question is this the best tool for the

299
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:35,920
job and is this the best frame not only

300
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,060
is this is the best framework for now

301
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:38,949
but is this the best framework for me is

302
00:12:38,949 --> 00:12:40,420
this message cool for me and that's what

303
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:42,160
it's really about we're all different

304
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,329
people and we all have different

305
00:12:43,329 --> 00:12:45,459
problems solved and there are many many

306
00:12:45,459 --> 00:12:46,410
tools out there that

307
00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:47,699
all these problems very differently and

308
00:12:47,699 --> 00:12:49,560
the idea that someone can go on hacker

309
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:52,860
news and say like this framework is the

310
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:56,279
best framework just I mean it's crazy

311
00:12:56,279 --> 00:12:58,529
okay I don't understand how we can

312
00:12:58,529 --> 00:13:00,269
actually think like that and expect us

313
00:13:00,269 --> 00:13:02,490
to move forward as developers and as a

314
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:06,420
you know as a community so the next

315
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:07,889
thing is tied into that in the mix of

316
00:13:07,889 --> 00:13:10,800
the next specs next next best thing and

317
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,100
that's that when you label yourself

318
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:16,079
that's also a fashion statement so if I

319
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:19,620
said you know I'm a COBOL developer then

320
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:23,040
I'd probably get made fun of I'm not so

321
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:26,279
don't make fun of me but um but if I if

322
00:13:26,279 --> 00:13:28,829
I was I would be like oh okay you're a

323
00:13:28,829 --> 00:13:30,750
cobalt developer you know have you been

324
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:33,920
online in the last 30 years but there's

325
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:37,019
there's it's really about fashion

326
00:13:37,019 --> 00:13:38,670
statements is about showing off that

327
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:40,769
you're on the bleeding edge and the

328
00:13:40,769 --> 00:13:44,639
bleeding edge is cut to you there's a

329
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:47,540
reason it's called the bleeding edge but

330
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:49,410
really the best practice is the

331
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:50,790
knowledge that best practices change

332
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:52,439
them I'm making a lot of you know

333
00:13:52,439 --> 00:13:54,509
paradoxical statements but the best

334
00:13:54,509 --> 00:13:57,750
practice is that you know best practices

335
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:59,160
are always going to keep moving forward

336
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:02,399
and it's funny to think that to try to

337
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:04,860
believe that at any given moment you're

338
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:07,290
doing the absolute best practice like

339
00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:09,240
you know three years ago or four years

340
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:11,040
ago obviously browsers change and

341
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,649
everything changed but Steve Souter said

342
00:14:13,649 --> 00:14:15,899
you know hey everybody the best practice

343
00:14:15,899 --> 00:14:19,740
for delivering JavaScript to the web is

344
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:21,990
bundle everything together into a single

345
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:24,959
javascript file and serve it cached to

346
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:27,600
all your clients okay everyone was again

347
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,449
now everybody bundle now and

348
00:14:30,449 --> 00:14:32,459
everyone did and now three years later

349
00:14:32,459 --> 00:14:34,860
it's like everyone split up all your

350
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:36,809
files into different small components

351
00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:38,910
and use lab j as to require to load them

352
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:41,100
asynchronously it's like yeah let's load

353
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:42,870
them asynchronously and it's awesome

354
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:44,879
that we're so into these different you

355
00:14:44,879 --> 00:14:47,639
know movements and changes but being

356
00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:49,410
prepared for those changes and knowing

357
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:50,100
that it's not

358
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:51,990
the ultimate solution is the only way to

359
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:55,079
really move forward and what that means

360
00:14:55,079 --> 00:14:57,690
is also you know be prepared but don't

361
00:14:57,690 --> 00:14:59,579
the second you hear about something new

362
00:14:59,579 --> 00:15:01,470
it doesn't mean you have to jump to that

363
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:04,500
conclusion the fact is that if you're

364
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:07,519
working in a big team in a big app like

365
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:10,649
making rewriting everything it just

366
00:15:10,649 --> 00:15:14,069
really isn't easy and you want to keep

367
00:15:14,069 --> 00:15:16,350
moving forward not sideways so moving an

368
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:18,870
entire app from Ruby to node you know if

369
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:20,550
you have three weeks and a million

370
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:23,160
dollars you know do it I applaud you you

371
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:25,680
know test out the new thing but it's not

372
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:29,250
really what we're you know rewriting you

373
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:30,870
might learn some new things but it's not

374
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:32,970
our goal as developers our goal as

375
00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:35,040
developers is to create new things and

376
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,319
rewriting is hard I've done it before

377
00:15:37,319 --> 00:15:41,220
it's not fun so this is going to offend

378
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:43,709
some people may be but the myth too is

379
00:15:43,709 --> 00:15:49,980
that this is this equation you know it's

380
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:52,649
true that you know fame and fortune you

381
00:15:52,649 --> 00:15:54,449
don't doesn't come from open source and

382
00:15:54,449 --> 00:15:56,220
even though in the age github you know

383
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:59,430
we're all pushing things constantly when

384
00:15:59,430 --> 00:16:01,529
you write a project you're not big bear

385
00:16:01,529 --> 00:16:03,360
you're not instantly you know gonna

386
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:06,660
gonna get blunts and bears with

387
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:09,269
sunglasses and piles of gold and it's

388
00:16:09,269 --> 00:16:10,589
just not going to happen that doesn't

389
00:16:10,589 --> 00:16:12,540
come from being an open-source developer

390
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:14,069
maybe you get to go to conferences it's

391
00:16:14,069 --> 00:16:16,019
awesome maybe you get to speak like I'm

392
00:16:16,019 --> 00:16:18,810
doing to you but in the end it's not the

393
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:20,550
end all be all there are other ways to

394
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:22,110
get to where we are and there are other

395
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:26,850
ways to be successful so this is a this

396
00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:28,769
is a message that close source isn't a

397
00:16:28,769 --> 00:16:31,500
pure evil I mean this is kind of

398
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,569
contradictory to why I'm up here as an

399
00:16:33,569 --> 00:16:34,680
open-source developer and someone

400
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,149
contributes a lot to open source you

401
00:16:36,149 --> 00:16:37,889
think that I want to open source

402
00:16:37,889 --> 00:16:40,709
everything but you know what I mean I'm

403
00:16:40,709 --> 00:16:42,930
a man of many beliefs and I think that

404
00:16:42,930 --> 00:16:45,240
closed source is not a pure evil it

405
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,800
doesn't necessarily mean that if you're

406
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,449
writing something not in secret but with

407
00:16:48,449 --> 00:16:50,100
a team and working together as a team

408
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:52,350
with other people that that won't create

409
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:54,810
a good product and i gotta say that

410
00:16:54,810 --> 00:16:56,519
actually over the past couple months in

411
00:16:56,519 --> 00:16:57,150
past couple year

412
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:58,590
I've done some projects that are open

413
00:16:58,590 --> 00:16:59,550
source and I've gotten great feedback

414
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:01,890
and it's moved them forward and I've had

415
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:04,190
other projects that I've kept myself and

416
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:07,020
developed not a secret but with a team

417
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:09,510
that's uniquely focused and not this

418
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:12,450
wide world that has a vast array of

419
00:17:12,450 --> 00:17:14,790
opinions about what is good and what is

420
00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:17,550
bad and I've put some stuff as open

421
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:19,200
sourcing you know the fact is when you

422
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,430
put some stuff is open source you have

423
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:21,900
to maintain it forever basically that's

424
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:25,710
the that's the contract and you know

425
00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:27,780
there are some really great things that

426
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:29,250
have come out of close our software and

427
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:30,120
I'm not going to even list them because

428
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:31,290
they're probably too many lists

429
00:17:31,290 --> 00:17:32,280
obviously there's things that come out

430
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:34,680
of open source but the fact is that you

431
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:37,590
know if you actually the point is don't

432
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:40,050
don't care about pushing first you know

433
00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:42,570
write something do it well and then

434
00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:45,330
maybe if it works for you it'll work for

435
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:46,350
someone else but it doesn't necessarily

436
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:48,540
have to work that way right what's good

437
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:50,790
for you ok so now I'm going to go into

438
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:54,080
the truth so the truce of common

439
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:56,040
client-side development is that it's a

440
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:58,440
perilous path from with pirates and

441
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:02,220
wizards dragons vengeful gods and you

442
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:06,110
know it's really really really hard I

443
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:09,210
mean it's a lot easier than it was ten

444
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:11,580
years ago but you know it's still really

445
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:14,270
really hard we're fighting against this

446
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:17,340
ever-changing platforms you know not

447
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:18,600
just a single platform but ever-changing

448
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,910
platforms that are constantly changing

449
00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:24,060
without us even knowing or or have tiny

450
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:26,460
bugs like Monta was even saying today

451
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:29,070
that chrome you know dev channel breaks

452
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:31,530
the Twitter authentic often that's like

453
00:18:31,530 --> 00:18:33,660
an example of we don't really we have

454
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:35,490
very little control over all the

455
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:37,710
platforms that we deploy to so it's very

456
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:40,170
very hard and but what doesn't kill us

457
00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:43,350
makes us stronger and you know the fact

458
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:44,730
is is that there is no perfect platform

459
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:47,630
and there is no perfect framework and

460
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:50,400
there are things that we can extract

461
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,710
from these tools that make a lot of

462
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:54,420
things a lot easier but it still is

463
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:57,570
going to be hard but so I have a list of

464
00:18:57,570 --> 00:18:58,590
what you should demand from a

465
00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:01,440
client-side framework and my demands

466
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,670
personally your demands might be

467
00:19:02,670 --> 00:19:04,560
different are just that it has a clean

468
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:07,260
consistent API it has enough

469
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:09,000
sure to help but not hang you and not

470
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,390
slow you down and its most importantly

471
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:14,360
it solves a problem that your app has

472
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:17,430
you can find a framework that solves

473
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:19,050
that solves a problem your app doesn't

474
00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:21,780
have and a lot of people do that and

475
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:23,970
spend a lot of time working on that I

476
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:27,840
like frameworks and tools that solves

477
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:31,770
problem solve problems that I have so

478
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:33,360
Sam and Jack solve a problem that I have

479
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,610
and I'll tell you about it first of all

480
00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:37,860
samia's not for everyone but and it's

481
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:39,390
not for everything but it's off some

482
00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:43,230
problems really well the core thing that

483
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:45,000
it has is a separation of paths or

484
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,490
routes with a restful ideology now rest

485
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:49,500
is like a you know not just a buzzword

486
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:52,980
but it's really you know another term

487
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:55,280
rock with a lot of discussion and

488
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:57,090
different people believe different

489
00:19:57,090 --> 00:19:59,010
things about what rest actually is but

490
00:19:59,010 --> 00:20:01,830
the basic idea of having patterns that

491
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:05,460
Matt URLs to methods and have that kind

492
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:07,050
of functionality where URL is mapped to

493
00:20:07,050 --> 00:20:11,430
a to a clear a clear tool so in this

494
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:14,400
case this is what a simple sammy app

495
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:17,640
looks like we define some routes we say

496
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:20,910
get users are posted users and we get

497
00:20:20,910 --> 00:20:23,400
users we get the list of users and you

498
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,630
know I commented out what the actual

499
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:25,950
method bodies do but it's just pure

500
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:28,410
JavaScript you can you know glowed users

501
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:31,890
from from server and can load them from

502
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:33,630
local storage or whatever you want and

503
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:36,660
then post users where posts were we're

504
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:38,520
mocking a post request basically in

505
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:40,920
accepting a form submission into Sammy

506
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:43,770
and then inside of the route we get back

507
00:20:43,770 --> 00:20:47,070
a params hash that has all the form

508
00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:48,960
elements that were our form inputs that

509
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,780
were in that post um it also supports

510
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:55,230
put and del not delete that's because

511
00:20:55,230 --> 00:20:57,000
deletes a reserved word in JavaScript

512
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:01,080
and it just breaks everything so the

513
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:02,160
other thing that it's good at really

514
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,170
good at or i think is template rendering

515
00:21:04,170 --> 00:21:07,230
and munging so this is the exam this is

516
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:09,050
an example in Samuel 7 of like what

517
00:21:09,050 --> 00:21:11,550
rendering floating your partial and

518
00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:11,970
rendering

519
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:14,870
template looks like sorry and it's all

520
00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:19,020
it's it's chained in chaining in this

521
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:20,970
render contacts format means that it's

522
00:21:20,970 --> 00:21:22,620
asynchronous it's kind of like promises

523
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:25,620
but even though those all are could be

524
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:27,810
or make might be asynchronous cause they

525
00:21:27,810 --> 00:21:30,000
all happen in the guaranteed order so

526
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,890
you're loading a partial which is just

527
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:35,400
an HTML template that replaces the page

528
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,530
then you're loading a JSON object from

529
00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:40,350
the server that has a list of users or a

530
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:45,330
user by ID and then you take a template

531
00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:47,190
out of a script tag which is that user

532
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:48,840
template mustache which is a mustache

533
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:53,120
template and then replace the user

534
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,590
selector with that template with the

535
00:21:55,590 --> 00:21:58,080
data from the server lunged into it and

536
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:01,650
that does a lot and if I think it's

537
00:22:01,650 --> 00:22:04,500
pretty clean it's obviously if you don't

538
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:05,760
like chaining you probably won't like it

539
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:06,720
and there are other ways to get around

540
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:10,860
it but I think it solves the common

541
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:13,080
problem of wanting to have data on the

542
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:15,180
server and templates in the client or on

543
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:17,790
the server and munching them and merging

544
00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:19,230
them together and putting them on the

545
00:22:19,230 --> 00:22:23,040
client so what it doesn't include is

546
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:26,190
data modeling really it's trying to be

547
00:22:26,190 --> 00:22:27,960
as simple as possible and not decide how

548
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,280
you should model your data so you have

549
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:32,580
to really bring your own and for me that

550
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:35,700
means that I have some api's that are

551
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:37,650
just JSON I write a lot of standing

552
00:22:37,650 --> 00:22:38,910
opposite don't even talk to a server

553
00:22:38,910 --> 00:22:41,790
that are just client-side and it does

554
00:22:41,790 --> 00:22:43,590
that without having bringing extra

555
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:46,170
weight of having to tell you how to

556
00:22:46,170 --> 00:22:47,910
define your model it's not opinionated

557
00:22:47,910 --> 00:22:51,210
in that way it's agile meaning it bends

558
00:22:51,210 --> 00:22:54,080
well and it can bend a lot of different

559
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:59,100
use cases so for example my favorite is

560
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:02,790
prototyping it's really really really

561
00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:04,980
really good at prototyping I don't want

562
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:08,280
a to my own horn so much but it I find

563
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:10,980
that because it's so small and you can

564
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:12,600
just include it in a page and basically

565
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:15,270
define how a flow should happen entirely

566
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:17,070
in JavaScript and low templates and do

567
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:19,140
that stuff I've used it in a large

568
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:20,020
number of cases

569
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:23,020
in my team when I can't I'm not a very

570
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:24,520
good I'm not I'm not very good at

571
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:25,750
talking I don't know if who knows that

572
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:29,950
but I explained I'm better at explaining

573
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:32,100
things through pictures and through

574
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:34,690
through actually real workflows and I do

575
00:23:34,690 --> 00:23:36,220
that with my team all the time where

576
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:37,750
I'll say oh you're supposed to click on

577
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:39,340
this and then it goes to this page and

578
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:42,160
then it redirects back here or oh you're

579
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,300
supposed to have this form on this page

580
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:45,310
and logs in and it should show you this

581
00:23:45,310 --> 00:23:47,740
you can do that and prototype that in

582
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:49,720
Sami without touching a server and just

583
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,610
having an index HTML template that you

584
00:23:51,610 --> 00:23:54,370
vote in the browser and if you're a

585
00:23:54,370 --> 00:23:57,490
JavaScript developer that you know can

586
00:23:57,490 --> 00:24:00,310
work with just that then it's really

587
00:24:00,310 --> 00:24:02,890
great as a tool for that it's really not

588
00:24:02,890 --> 00:24:04,990
great for complex data or complex

589
00:24:04,990 --> 00:24:07,540
behavioral challenges I mean you can use

590
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:09,610
it for that but it I I would not

591
00:24:09,610 --> 00:24:11,740
probably use it for very very large apps

592
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:16,600
and it's also not for the developer who

593
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:18,310
needs conventions for everything if you

594
00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:20,710
really want pattern to stick to and just

595
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:23,710
stick to it then it then go for it but

596
00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:27,420
it helps my team and I do our job so

597
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:30,670
this is the new paperless post design

598
00:24:30,670 --> 00:24:31,800
tool that we've worked on for a while

599
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:35,290
and one of the cool things that so so

600
00:24:35,290 --> 00:24:37,240
Sammy is just a small piece of this like

601
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:39,550
there's a lot of going on here and

602
00:24:39,550 --> 00:24:41,440
there's a lot of calls to the server and

603
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,660
there's a lot of client side templating

604
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:46,150
and all that stuff and Sammy really all

605
00:24:46,150 --> 00:24:48,610
it handles is basically driving the

606
00:24:48,610 --> 00:24:50,740
state of the application so you can kind

607
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:53,050
of see up in the URL probably not

608
00:24:53,050 --> 00:24:55,870
actually but there's a path that has

609
00:24:55,870 --> 00:24:58,150
kind of a sháá hatch at the end so the

610
00:24:58,150 --> 00:25:00,250
way we work this is that the Shah hash

611
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:02,470
represents a tool state and what's going

612
00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:05,020
on in the design tool and as things

613
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:07,600
change now as you update state the hash

614
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,850
changes and if you reloaded the page it

615
00:25:09,850 --> 00:25:11,080
would go exactly back to the Play Store

616
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:13,030
in the design tool which is pretty cool

617
00:25:13,030 --> 00:25:16,150
and it's great for that but the actual

618
00:25:16,150 --> 00:25:18,310
methods of the tool and the way the tool

619
00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:20,230
works and the interactivity Sammy

620
00:25:20,230 --> 00:25:23,200
doesn't drive that it's really not our

621
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:26,080
entire app as I said it's it's and I

622
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:28,000
don't think any framework wherever will

623
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,890
ever be there's too many specific things

624
00:25:29,890 --> 00:25:32,020
that we need that no framework solids

625
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:32,640
really well

626
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:35,280
and I think a framework with a framework

627
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:37,320
that we'd have to drive that would have

628
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:39,180
to drive the entire app would bind us

629
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:41,400
too much to a single philosophy and we

630
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:44,790
really like experimenting so this is

631
00:25:44,790 --> 00:25:46,830
kind of a detour in the last piece but

632
00:25:46,830 --> 00:25:49,410
the truth of work so the truth of work

633
00:25:49,410 --> 00:25:51,840
is that it's really really really hard I

634
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:54,000
don't know about you but I like my job

635
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,270
but it's still really hard and good

636
00:25:57,270 --> 00:25:59,370
developers what they want to do is make

637
00:25:59,370 --> 00:26:00,990
their work easier and basically make

638
00:26:00,990 --> 00:26:04,200
tools that make their jobs easier so

639
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,400
here I'm going to go in a little tangent

640
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:08,760
but a couple years ago we had this you

641
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:10,890
know transition where everyone started

642
00:26:10,890 --> 00:26:12,780
calling themselves developers instead of

643
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:14,640
programmers and I tried to find the

644
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,410
source of where this really started and

645
00:26:16,410 --> 00:26:18,930
I I couldn't track it down but there

646
00:26:18,930 --> 00:26:19,980
were a couple mailing lists threads

647
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:23,040
about it in my 2003-2004 but at some

648
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,930
point where web developers not knock web

649
00:26:24,930 --> 00:26:26,580
programmers and I think that's an

650
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:29,100
important distinction programmers make

651
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:31,950
machines work they're the guys who sit

652
00:26:31,950 --> 00:26:33,150
behind a keyboard probably in one of

653
00:26:33,150 --> 00:26:35,550
these vaults and you know tap the button

654
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:38,040
every every 40 minutes to make sure that

655
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:41,730
the world didn't explode and that's what

656
00:26:41,730 --> 00:26:42,810
they did they just made the machines

657
00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:44,460
work they programmed the machines to

658
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:45,600
make them work there wasn't really an

659
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:51,330
interaction ok yeah so sorry so you guys

660
00:26:51,330 --> 00:26:55,620
get it that's it we're here so then this

661
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:59,940
guy's a developer um right he's like

662
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:02,130
building stuff he's going into the

663
00:27:02,130 --> 00:27:04,290
ghetto with bulldozers and just knocking

664
00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:07,730
it down right and building is bright new

665
00:27:07,730 --> 00:27:12,210
brand new complex of of shiny apartment

666
00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:14,220
buildings that rich white people can

667
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:16,500
live in with their dog so it's like that

668
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:18,690
sort of developer does he doesn't just

669
00:27:18,690 --> 00:27:20,700
he doesn't just make a machine he isn't

670
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:22,500
drives a bulldozer in tight and just

671
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:24,300
going that that's what a programmer does

672
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:26,670
developer thumbs up I'm knocking down

673
00:27:26,670 --> 00:27:30,690
entire cities

674
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:33,650
so what developers do is they build and

675
00:27:33,650 --> 00:27:35,900
they bulldoze and recreate they they

676
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:37,880
they develop something they don't just

677
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:41,720
program it they recreated constantly and

678
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:44,750
they keep making it better that's the

679
00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:47,120
end of the tangent but so what have we

680
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:49,490
lost sight of have we lost sight of what

681
00:27:49,490 --> 00:27:51,740
we developed you know there's a lot I

682
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:52,970
mean we're here at Jay has come so

683
00:27:52,970 --> 00:27:54,320
obviously we're talking about JavaScript

684
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:57,409
all weekend and it's really fun but what

685
00:27:57,409 --> 00:28:00,679
is the core of what we are we do I mean

686
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:02,960
at least for most of us javascript isn't

687
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,730
our job working on the language of

688
00:28:04,730 --> 00:28:06,559
JavaScript and working on frameworks in

689
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:07,880
our job there are a couple of people

690
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:09,289
here who are lucky enough to have that

691
00:28:09,289 --> 00:28:12,080
job and a really good at it people who

692
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:14,320
you know work on node or work on

693
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,820
browsers and really they're their

694
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:18,890
product is the framework in that tool

695
00:28:18,890 --> 00:28:21,350
itself for most of us most of us

696
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:23,419
frameworks are really just made to make

697
00:28:23,419 --> 00:28:25,899
our jobs easier they're not the end goal

698
00:28:25,899 --> 00:28:29,210
so they're really not our job so why are

699
00:28:29,210 --> 00:28:30,679
we spending so much time talking about

700
00:28:30,679 --> 00:28:32,419
them it's kind of weird I mean why am I

701
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:34,039
here for a half an hour talking about

702
00:28:34,039 --> 00:28:37,700
them but really frameworks are there to

703
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:39,049
let them guide you and make your job

704
00:28:39,049 --> 00:28:41,570
easier but really what they're supposed

705
00:28:41,570 --> 00:28:43,610
to do is allow you to build something

706
00:28:43,610 --> 00:28:45,950
awesome and that's my message to you

707
00:28:45,950 --> 00:28:48,559
guys today is that you know it doesn't

708
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:50,480
matter what framework you use use

709
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,130
whatever you want and whatever makes

710
00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:53,929
your job easier but the end result

711
00:28:53,929 --> 00:28:55,039
should be that you're building something

712
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:57,169
awesome and there are tons of frameworks

713
00:28:57,169 --> 00:28:59,659
that let you do that if you let them but

714
00:28:59,659 --> 00:29:02,750
if you just argue about you know mine is

715
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:05,570
better than yours it's really just you

716
00:29:05,570 --> 00:29:07,130
know it's really just a pissing contest

717
00:29:07,130 --> 00:29:09,649
and it doesn't move the web and our

718
00:29:09,649 --> 00:29:11,720
tools further and doesn't move us as

719
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:13,820
developers further so my goal as

720
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:18,320
developer is to bulldoze all those

721
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:21,110
housing projects of the web you know the

722
00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:23,510
blink tag and everything and I'm going

723
00:29:23,510 --> 00:29:26,630
to make a awesome site that does

724
00:29:26,630 --> 00:29:27,950
something awesome for a lot of people

725
00:29:27,950 --> 00:29:31,309
and is it the tool that I use to do that

726
00:29:31,309 --> 00:29:33,529

727
00:29:33,529 --> 00:29:34,970

728
00:29:34,970 --> 00:29:35,500
using it

729
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:36,850

730
00:29:36,850 --> 00:29:38,620

00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:40,510
