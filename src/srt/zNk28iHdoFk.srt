my talk was called Haiti even design and

8
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:15,680
how we design for the web how we design

00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,140
for people in an inclusive and

10
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:21,680
intersectional way have fun and that the

11
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,750
web can do any kind of nonsense how we

12
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:25,750
can improve programming a communication

13
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:28,130
thinking better about language my

14
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:30,560
journey of chatting gears levers in my

00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,530
city burning bright but not bearing out

16
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:36,740
errors and error handling and ways to be

22
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:11,610
I applied for a scholarship I want to

23
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:14,430
get this experience and try to get it to

24
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:17,130
my own community reason why I attend

25
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:20,850
change camp is to experience the the

26
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:24,360
cyphers atmosphere of depth community

27
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:27,210
and I think it's the reason why taya

28
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:29,490
community is going so fast I actually

29
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:31,920
first came to this conference two years

30
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:35,670
ago on a scholarship ticket like the

31
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:37,230
next year I was kind of watching the

32
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:38,700

00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,910
Twitter this year I'm here as a speaker

00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,750
whole JavaScript community together

38
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:53,130
across different frameworks across

39
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:54,390

43
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:27,660
adulthood that I wouldn't have normally

44
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:30,450
made how welcoming is the community to

45
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:32,190
