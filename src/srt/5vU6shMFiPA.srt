always be back then if there were some

10
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:31,810
amazing force out some enough time to

11
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:36,460
take us back to where we were and hang

12
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:39,520
each moment up like pictures on the

13
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:43,179
walls inside a billion tiny frames so

14
00:01:43,179 --> 00:01:47,920
that we could see it all it would look

15
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:53,830
like will happen happening happen will

16
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:58,750
happen happening happen there we are

always be back then

21
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:19,870
that's why you and I will always be best

22

friends

[Music]

24
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:42,540
I'm just new I play the ukulele and I

25
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:45,060
also like games and so there's many

26
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:46,620
things you might know about me or want

27
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:47,730
to know about me these are the things

28
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:49,739
that are pertinent to this talk I like

29
00:02:49,739 --> 00:02:51,209
games like lots of games board games

30
00:02:51,209 --> 00:02:54,060
card games video games like a lot of you

31
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:57,660
I also program and then lastly I really

32
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:00,870
like mischief I like because I think of

33
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:04,680
it as a jump sounding board jumping

34
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,170
board whatever that term is into like

35
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:08,640
creative problem-solving creative

36
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,069
thinking and innovation I like mr. so

37
00:03:11,069 --> 00:03:15,870
much that I named my son Loki this is my

38
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:19,170
like a Terry father shot of my my son

39
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:23,400
who I'm so proud of uh-huh so one of the

40
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,110
games I've been playing is this game

41
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:27,810
called set I was playing this game with

42
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:29,790
my friends Susan I want to cut and go

43
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:33,000
over all the rules with you first so

44
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,370
it's a card game where by the way the

45
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:37,650
New York Times has a set game that you

46
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:39,180
can play it's kind of fun so you should

47
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:42,120
go check that out set is a card game

48
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,470
it's a matching card game you're trying

49
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:46,709
to make sets of three cards each all

50
00:03:46,709 --> 00:03:51,480
these cards have a color number pattern

51
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,880
and shape I can toggle this on really

52
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:56,359
quickly for any colorblind people so

53
00:03:56,359 --> 00:03:58,560
amongst these attributes what you're

54
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,760
going for is a set of three cards where

55
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,750
the attribute easy they're all the same

56
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:07,260
or all different and so here this is

57
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:09,989
this is an example of a set where the

58
00:04:09,989 --> 00:04:11,970
number is all different one two and

59
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:14,010
three the pattern is actually all the

60
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:15,780
same they're all striped their shapes

61
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:17,190
are all different and the colors are all

62
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:19,979
different so this is a pretty fun game

63
00:04:19,979 --> 00:04:22,620
until you play with somebody like my

64
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:26,600
friend Susan who I want to give you a oh

65
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,729
no I don't have music I want music on my

66
00:04:29,729 --> 00:04:36,050
thing maybe

67
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:43,060
oh no music so this is what playing set

68
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:45,970
against Susan is like it's where she

69
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:48,400
just starts taking cards and I'm just

70
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:52,080
observing and telling her hey good job

71
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:56,560
wow wow great great take their Oh almost

72
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:01,090
had that one oh okay oh wait do I see

73
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:03,400
something no no not at all

74
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:08,639
so it's trust me it is a fun game but

75
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:10,660
until you play against somebody like

76
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:12,700
Susan so how does that make me feel as a

77
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:14,490
protagonist of this talk

78
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:17,020
how does my protagonist satisfied with

79
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:18,700
their life I can't beat Susan instead

80
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:21,220
what would it take for my protagonist me

81
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:23,350
to find satisfaction this is their goal

82
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:26,440
beat Susan at Seth what are my

83
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:28,210
protagonist biggest fears and character

84
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:30,460
flaws well probably three things first

85
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:32,050
is that I don't really want to put the

86
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:34,479
effort into getting good at this game so

87
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:36,520
I could sit down and just play alone a

88
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:38,410
lot until I get really good at this game

89
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:41,350
because it's tricking your brain into

90
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:42,970
kind of seeing these sets as quickly as

91
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:46,479
possible but I am pretty lazy and so not

92
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:48,010
interested in that

93
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:49,720
I'm also impatient I just want to take

94
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,430
the time to do that

95
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:53,770
I'd rather do it and use it to anything

96
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:55,870
else and last of all the mother of all

97
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:59,620
character flaws hubris I'm pretty sure I

98
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:05,050
I was reading about Starcraft being beat

99
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:07,360
by deep mind and alphago and alpha zero

100
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,030
and the like I can do this I can solve

101
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:12,970
set with my computer and I can finally

102
00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:16,120
beat Susan this way and so I started

103
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,020
thinking about how this problem is

104
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:19,090
formed and so for a human it's

105
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:21,100
interesting because if you think of the

106
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:23,289
problem in two parts the set making is

107
00:06:23,289 --> 00:06:24,940
the hardest part for a human when you

108
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:26,979
you can quickly see these cards and you

109
00:06:26,979 --> 00:06:28,990
know what they are but you can't make

110
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:31,060
the sets very quickly out of them for a

111
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:32,500
computer it's actually the opposite the

112
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:35,139
set making is super easy and it's the

113
00:06:35,139 --> 00:06:36,460
vision part that's the hard part

114
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:38,200
so as you can tell we're going to

115
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,610
confuse your vision the crap out of this

116
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:40,050
problem

117
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:44,110
alright here's the plan we I want this

118
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:45,400
to run on my phone so I'm gonna use the

119
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,870
camera on my phone get into a browse

120
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:50,390
put on the canvas and then I get pixels

121
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:52,790
from those pixels we're gonna identify a

122
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:56,450
bunch of cards in the thing from there

123
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:59,210
we want to extract out every card and

124
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:00,500
then put each card we want to identify

125
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,300
the color number of shading and shape

126
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:03,500
and then eventually we're just going to

127
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:04,850
boot forth and solve for this at the end

128
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:07,240
all right so let's get into it

129
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:10,790
so this is my test image for this for

130
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:13,540
this thing as you can see bunch of cards

131
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:16,100
getting this out the things that you

132
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:17,540
kind of care about are these ones so

133
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:19,370
this get image data is what we care

134
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:21,830
about here we get out this big huge

135
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:23,600
number array so this looks kind of

136
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:28,940
foreboding and creepy it's got one no

137
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:31,940
eleven million pixels in it so let's go

138
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:33,260
over what this image data object is

139
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:36,620
really quickly you can think of images

140
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:39,920
as a series of pixels here we have not

141
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:43,550
six pixels six huge pixels and then each

142
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:46,130
pixel is itself basically four numbers

143
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:48,830
there's a red green blue and a

144
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:50,570
transparency or alpha component or GPA

145
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:53,060
so that's four numbers times six pixels

146
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:55,490
that's 24 numbers so that's our 24

147
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:58,550
numbers that we see here and then it's a

148
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:00,170
flat array so it's one dimensional but

149
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:02,000
if you know the width that you can you

150
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,670
know basically we wrap it and so this

151
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:07,310
array corresponds to this picture up

152
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:09,440
here and if I change this that trend so

153
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,090
that's transparency so that goes away I

154
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:14,150
can bring it back I can make it black I

155
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:18,230
can make this one red so you can see how

156
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:19,970
those think go so we're gonna be using

157
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:21,260
this image data object a lot throughout

158
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:23,210
this talk so I gotta get familiar with

159
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:23,540
it

160
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:26,630
so first step is we want to threshold

161
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:28,460
out we want to simplify this picture a

162
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:31,010
whole bunch when I basically changed

163
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:34,820
into straight black and white and that's

164
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:36,860
to make our job a lot easier later on to

165
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:40,730
do this this is called threshold incan

166
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:43,220
vertebrae are G B value into a gray and

167
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:45,140
then if that gray is over below a

168
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:47,360
certain value I either set it to white

169
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,570
55 or black zero and so if I change this

170
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:53,240
this slider you can kind of see how it

171
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:56,690
affects the image and then an

172
00:08:56,690 --> 00:08:58,340
entertaining thing to note here is that

173
00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:00,320
you'll notice that this is not a linear

174
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,550
transform from our G

175
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:04,550
Beata gray and that really quickly is if

176
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:05,600
you look at these green and blue values

177
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,640
here so this is actually the same amount

178
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,080
of green and blue like hitting your eye

179
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:11,269
but because of how your retinas all

180
00:09:11,269 --> 00:09:14,810
jacked up you perceive the green a lot

181
00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:17,149
more than the blue and so you think

182
00:09:17,149 --> 00:09:18,709
green is a lot a lot lighter than blue

183
00:09:18,709 --> 00:09:20,269
and so that's take into account with

184
00:09:20,269 --> 00:09:23,240
this formula here alright so we have a

185
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,040
black and white image now we want to

186
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:29,149
find those cards again to do that we go

187
00:09:29,149 --> 00:09:30,950
to NPM and just find somewhere in the

188
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:33,850
package that finds finds contours for us

189
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:36,709
but what this package does it's called

190
00:09:36,709 --> 00:09:38,390
more neighborhood tracing which sounds

191
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:39,769
scary because it has a dude's name on

192
00:09:39,769 --> 00:09:42,290
the front of it and uses neighborhood in

193
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:43,519
the context that makes no sense

194
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:44,810
whatsoever

195
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:47,060
but you can think of this as say you're

196
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:49,399
an aunt and you really like black pixels

197
00:09:49,399 --> 00:09:52,040
and your exploratory ants so you're just

198
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,450
out off for a walk and you're meeting

199
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:54,649
with article so you're just scanning

200
00:09:54,649 --> 00:09:57,709
through all this black and then you all

201
00:09:57,709 --> 00:09:59,089
of a sudden hit this white pix whoa whoa

202
00:09:59,089 --> 00:10:02,209
what is this this is new let's figure

203
00:10:02,209 --> 00:10:04,040
this thing out so you kind of back up

204
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:06,380
and you go to the side you kind of hit

205
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:07,970
it again like Oh white pixel again you

206
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:09,649
back up you got you go to the side you

207
00:10:09,649 --> 00:10:12,020
do that a whole bunch until you're kind

208
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:14,029
of like making it way around this whole

209
00:10:14,029 --> 00:10:15,950
thing until you're all the way back to

210
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:18,649
the beginning again and so if you've

211
00:10:18,649 --> 00:10:20,329
paid attention and like late couples

212
00:10:20,329 --> 00:10:22,040
down you've basically made and trace the

213
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:25,070
path around this card so that's more

214
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:27,709
neighborhood tracing you'll notice that

215
00:10:27,709 --> 00:10:30,620
I then so I take the threshold image

216
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:31,850
we're going through that I get a bunch

217
00:10:31,850 --> 00:10:35,360
of contours and then I ended up

218
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,850
filtering based on area here and so if I

219
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:39,320
kind of change some of these values

220
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,779
which now you'll notice that I'm

221
00:10:41,779 --> 00:10:44,540
twiddling values a lot of these values

222
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:47,510
have to do with the source image so I'm

223
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:48,920
kind of like picking numbers out of the

224
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:50,899
air based on kind of the parameters of

225
00:10:50,899 --> 00:10:53,209
what I'm assuming and that's gonna be

226
00:10:53,209 --> 00:10:55,459
important later on so here I've like

227
00:10:55,459 --> 00:10:57,560
made the area threshold go away lower so

228
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:00,110
I can basically pull out smaller shapes

229
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:02,959
but I actually don't want those so let's

230
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:05,600
go back to here and only get 12 of them

231
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,720
so I'm back to my original 12 cards and

232
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,600
let's see where are we we want to now

233
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,700
pull out each card

234
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:15,410
to do this we need to simplify that path

235
00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:17,899
a little further instead of so that path

236
00:11:17,899 --> 00:11:19,339
is like a whole bunch of thoughts around

237
00:11:19,339 --> 00:11:21,940
that card ultimately what I want is this

238
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:24,980
rectangular string or quadrilateral that

239
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:27,470
consists of only four vertices to do

240
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:31,070
that there's probably a cool name for

241
00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:32,810
this thing but I made up some random way

242
00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:34,970
to do this what I end up doing is

243
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:36,680
basically removing pixels so I want to

244
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:39,560
remove redundant pixels along a line and

245
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,480
so I just keep removing and down until

246
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:44,180
I'm down to four the way I just choose

247
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:45,829
which pixel to remove next is basically

248
00:11:45,829 --> 00:11:47,480
the one that results in the these

249
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:50,810
minimum least area change and which

250
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:52,670
results in a pretty good rectangle this

251
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:56,120
point now I want to pull out every card

252
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:58,399
so this is now where I'm going from here

253
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:01,850
to here so this is called perspective

254
00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:04,459
transform which again go to MPN you just

255
00:12:04,459 --> 00:12:06,230
search for perspective transform you get

256
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:08,690
this thing this is basically linear

257
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:09,230
algebra

258
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:11,600
I'm not guys playing this one but linear

259
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,910
algebra matrix math you can pull out

260
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:16,399
basically and transform from perspective

261
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:19,339
into this perspective all right we got

262
00:12:19,339 --> 00:12:23,180
every card it's kind of oh so we need to

263
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:24,260
correct for the lighting in the room

264
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:26,420
basically you'll notice here that this

265
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:28,550
is I took this in like a yellowish lated

266
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:30,290
room sometimes you get warm lighting

267
00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:31,990
sometimes you get cool lighting

268
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:33,860
ultimately want to kind of correct for

269
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:36,110
that so we want the background of the

270
00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:38,570
cards to basically be as like 255 - to

271
00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:43,459
565 white to do that we can assume that

272
00:12:43,459 --> 00:12:45,410
our white point so we need a white point

273
00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:47,480
we can assume that the background of the

274
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:50,000
card is white and so what I've done is

275
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,490
just average the top and bottom borders

276
00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:55,399
of every card and called that my white

277
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:58,430
point and then using that I can shift

278
00:12:58,430 --> 00:13:01,600
every pixel in the image in RGB space

279
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,640
into basically where the background is

280
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:06,019
of averaging out to be more white than

281
00:13:06,019 --> 00:13:09,170
the rest of the card and all the all the

282
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:10,100
other colors and the slightly

283
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:11,449
brightening also which is actually good

284
00:13:11,449 --> 00:13:14,630
okay so recapping where we are we got

285
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:16,790
our image we identified some cards we

286
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:18,829
extract with cards and now we want to go

287
00:13:18,829 --> 00:13:20,660
for all of the colors and all the things

288
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:24,529
in them so here we have the spectrum of

289
00:13:24,529 --> 00:13:26,000
the required so I've gone through and

290
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:26,950
basically just grabbed every

291
00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:30,160
pixal mapped it to a hue and then

292
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,410
throwing out all the white so as you can

293
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:35,260
tell this is actually pretty pretty

294
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:37,720
indicative of kind of all the cards I

295
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,820
ran through it's pretty easy to tell

296
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:42,100
that there's a purple card a red card a

297
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:44,200
green card this weird one here is kind

298
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,850
of interesting so that one was actually

299
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:48,370
this one here we can kinda see some

300
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:50,260
rainbow in going on here which is still

301
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:52,960
fine there's a lot of strong signal here

302
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:56,530
still in the purple so totally fine next

303
00:13:56,530 --> 00:13:59,650
one is number so for number again I just

304
00:13:59,650 --> 00:14:02,020
throw contouring out again for each card

305
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:04,480
I run through the contour finder and I

306
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,100
get contours and I end up looking at the

307
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:08,620
percentage area or sorry the percentage

308
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:11,440
width of the contours versus the entire

309
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:14,860
card so if there's one shape on there

310
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:17,830
it'll end up around 25% when there's two

311
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:20,050
it's around like 55% and when there's

312
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:22,120
three it's around 85% and we can go

313
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,410
ahead and correct for this kind of case

314
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:25,390
where I miss a contour by just using

315
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:26,560
this and mirroring it over here and

316
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,480
assuming that deducing basically that

317
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:31,870
this is going to be three okay we got

318
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:34,930
two things down next one is shading for

319
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:37,870
shading we want to grab basically the

320
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:40,480
inner core of every contour and look at

321
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:43,780
its average luminosity so to grab its

322
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:45,370
inner core you end up just taking a

323
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:46,720
bounding box of the entire contour

324
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,850
cutting that down to like three fourths

325
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:51,190
of the size of the thing and then

326
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:53,140
averaging pixels again inside of that

327
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:56,560
internal box to give you basically so

328
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,660
for an outline you end up with white

329
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:01,530
pretty much so everything above 55

330
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:03,820
four-striped you end up with somewhere

331
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:06,490
between 230 and 240 and then for solid

332
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:07,720
you end up with everything below like

333
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:10,570
180 again you'll notice that like I'm

334
00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:12,550
kind of like hard coding these values in

335
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:16,120
at some point shape is a little bit more

336
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:18,850
complicated so shape we can kind of do

337
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:20,530
the same thing and take that bounding

338
00:15:20,530 --> 00:15:22,540
box and look at the percentage area of

339
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:27,700
the contour versus the shape and then we

340
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:31,050
get this so diamond is actually a lot of

341
00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:33,810
doesn't take up a lot of that area

342
00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:35,860
squiggle to explode but more an oval

343
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:37,720
takes up the most this though is getting

344
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,760
a little close for me so like this the

345
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:40,649
difference between Oh

346
00:15:40,649 --> 00:15:43,139
those were iffy so I decided to throw in

347
00:15:43,139 --> 00:15:46,559
yet another dimension here so this is a

348
00:15:46,559 --> 00:15:50,279
convex hull so this is this chart down

349
00:15:50,279 --> 00:15:51,720
here is the same as this top one but

350
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,999
I've added a Y dimension so it pulls out

351
00:15:53,999 --> 00:15:56,009
some of these values the convex well you

352
00:15:56,009 --> 00:15:57,360
can think of is like basically taking

353
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,189
some saran wrap and wrapping these

354
00:15:59,189 --> 00:16:01,829
shapes in saran wrap and so that's the

355
00:16:01,829 --> 00:16:04,230
shape you get for oval and diamond you

356
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:06,300
end up with basically no change in the

357
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:08,399
convex hull and then for squiggle you in

358
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:09,480
to put more so this pulls it out a

359
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,230
little better and makes the

360
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:13,139
classification a lot easier finally

361
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:14,429
we're down to like the boot floor set

362
00:16:14,429 --> 00:16:16,980
finding here's where the computer

363
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:18,329
actually has a structure information in

364
00:16:18,329 --> 00:16:20,369
order to go ahead and look for all the

365
00:16:20,369 --> 00:16:22,920
sets when you do the math it's 12 cards

366
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:25,290
3 cards per set that's only 220 possible

367
00:16:25,290 --> 00:16:27,629
sets which is absolutely nothing to a

368
00:16:27,629 --> 00:16:30,119
computer a crunch it crushes this in 20

369
00:16:30,119 --> 00:16:32,819
microseconds and checking all those 200

370
00:16:32,819 --> 00:16:36,629
many possible sets for four sets to kind

371
00:16:36,629 --> 00:16:38,160
of put this more into perspective when

372
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,170
you think of sets per minute I'm at like

373
00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:42,449
one set per minute Susan's good she's at

374
00:16:42,449 --> 00:16:44,459
like 20 sets per minute and the computer

375
00:16:44,459 --> 00:16:48,420
is at 300,000 sets per minute so it's

376
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:52,019
got us beat there by far so then knowing

377
00:16:52,019 --> 00:16:53,129
the sets you just draw them back on the

378
00:16:53,129 --> 00:16:54,389
source image and got this cool looking

379
00:16:54,389 --> 00:16:58,800
thing here so how does this play out how

380
00:16:58,800 --> 00:16:59,459
did I do

381
00:16:59,459 --> 00:17:02,309
so let's see I'm gonna give it away but

382
00:17:02,309 --> 00:17:06,120
this is playing again against Susan with

383
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:09,449
with my first build or so you know I'm

384
00:17:09,449 --> 00:17:10,980
not doing so well still actually there

385
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:12,419
was no sets there oh never mind there

386
00:17:12,419 --> 00:17:15,539
was one she took it oh I got one that's

387
00:17:15,539 --> 00:17:18,679
way better than I was doing before and

388
00:17:18,679 --> 00:17:22,350
it was basically a pretty even match

389
00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:24,750
actually basically when Susan's slow I

390
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:27,870
can get a set if she's fast then I still

391
00:17:27,870 --> 00:17:35,270
lose and that was actually due to due to

392
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:43,140
no this way so we lost in this example

393
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:45,960
still it was very sad so what happens is

394
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,909
that like we trained this thing on

395
00:17:47,909 --> 00:17:49,590
basically one or two or three source

396
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:53,250
images which is exactly the problem with

397
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:54,640
overfitting so I

398
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,990
we built the model based on like a

399
00:17:55,990 --> 00:17:57,850
couple source images I didn't take into

400
00:17:57,850 --> 00:17:58,780
account a whole lot of different

401
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:01,900
lighting that I might come into contact

402
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:03,850
with shadows lots of other different

403
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:06,520
things and so the way the fix this is

404
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08,380
basically you get a lot of source images

405
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:11,590
so I went back and I built into my thing

406
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:13,930
a way to quickly grab a lot of images

407
00:18:13,930 --> 00:18:16,510
and then tag them and then based on that

408
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:21,340
I can actually find stuff or sorry I can

409
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:22,870
train this a little better so it's

410
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:24,970
basically taking all those all those

411
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:26,350
images and using those who in four

412
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:27,970
models magic numbers which I call poor

413
00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:29,830
man's machine learning which is exactly

414
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:31,660
actually machine learning so don't let

415
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:33,130
anyone tell you otherwise

416
00:18:33,130 --> 00:18:35,280
it's basically machine learning is doing

417
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:38,490
so I put together a training montage

418
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:44,220
plays Fitz on YouTube oh it does ok I

419
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:47,010
don't need sound I'm gonna do this live

420
00:18:47,010 --> 00:19:14,169
start over cuz I got time this right

421
00:19:14,179 --> 00:19:20,580
so many times you change your passion

422
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:23,529
for coal

423
00:19:23,539 --> 00:19:29,129
don't longer dream of the pathless fight

424
00:19:29,129 --> 00:19:33,760
justice

425
00:19:33,770 --> 00:19:36,890
I have the tiger it's the thrill of the

426
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:40,520
fight rising up to the challenge of our

427
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:45,680
rival and the last known survivor stalks

428
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:57,150
their prey

429
00:19:57,160 --> 00:20:01,130
I got a

430
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:03,680
I love the tiger

431
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:11,540
[Music]

432
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:17,740
[Applause]

433
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:21,740
oh I went out of full screen no full

434
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:23,809
screen although all we're doing is a

435
00:20:23,809 --> 00:20:31,220
live demo next so okay I did I get so I

436
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:33,039
have a plant in the audience and

437
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:38,419
everyone welcome Anne and then could I

438
00:20:38,419 --> 00:20:42,530
get a dealer as miles around or anybody

439
00:20:42,530 --> 00:20:44,870
who wants to deal deal some cards

440
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:46,640
what software update to my phone trying

441
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,669
to all this nice wait

442
00:20:49,669 --> 00:20:52,669
I guess quit iTunes that decided to open

443
00:20:52,669 --> 00:20:55,760
on me oh look at some random images it's

444
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,260
good so anyone wants to cheating us

445
00:20:57,260 --> 00:20:59,530
their friends go to set that Visnic calm

446
00:20:59,530 --> 00:21:05,659
and that is my screen alright alright no

447
00:21:05,659 --> 00:21:07,460
dealer huh we need a deal there a deal

448
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:12,020
it would be great ooh Billy hi Billy I

449
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:23,110
work with Billy four by three twelve so

450
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:25,789
well this I have a chance of losing

451
00:21:25,789 --> 00:21:27,409
easily because the lighting up here is

452
00:21:27,409 --> 00:21:29,600
interesting

453
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:32,239
I tried this earlier and I think I was

454
00:21:32,239 --> 00:21:34,700
okay but also Anna's pretty good this

455
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:38,299
game and so we'll see we'll see how this

456
00:21:38,299 --> 00:21:41,090
goes are we ready we ready to go seven

457
00:21:41,090 --> 00:21:45,169
oh I'm cheating I can take it because

458
00:21:45,169 --> 00:21:48,679
I'm a cheater Oh No these cards are

459
00:21:48,679 --> 00:21:53,340
weird

460
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:56,239
Justin threshold Inge is there anything

461
00:21:56,239 --> 00:22:02,029
here that's not when it's a false

462
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:04,619
positive

463
00:22:04,629 --> 00:22:07,929
these cards are too close to each other

464
00:22:07,929 --> 00:22:12,590
wait wait wait for it no there's a sec

465
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:17,509
what yeah this is why humans still have

466
00:22:17,509 --> 00:22:18,169
a chance

467
00:22:18,169 --> 00:22:24,049
cuz computers can't see set I think the

468
00:22:24,049 --> 00:22:25,609
pressures getting to end the stage

469
00:22:25,609 --> 00:22:28,960
pressure oh there's a nice set yeah go

470
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:38,989
wow that was a harder set yeah set okay

471
00:22:38,989 --> 00:22:40,669
I think we get the idea cuz this is

472
00:22:40,669 --> 00:22:42,169
gonna take a while to go through but

473
00:22:42,169 --> 00:22:43,840
there's nothing right there that Han got

474
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:46,279
all right I'm gonna declare that a

475
00:22:46,279 --> 00:22:50,510
victory

476
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:56,850
thank you again so great we built some

477
00:22:56,850 --> 00:22:59,160
networks actually prepared for both

478
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:02,610
versions of this but we'd won so that's

479
00:23:02,610 --> 00:23:03,650
good

480
00:23:03,650 --> 00:23:06,390
this is a video just in case of showing

481
00:23:06,390 --> 00:23:07,559
that I also beat Susan

482
00:23:07,559 --> 00:23:11,130
so I completed my my accomplishment so

483
00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:12,210
the remaining things actually through

484
00:23:12,210 --> 00:23:13,980
here so I did all this in CPU in the

485
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:16,980
browser there's you could do all this in

486
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:18,540
WebGL which would be a lot of fun it's

487
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:20,220
totally dense itself the shaders and GL

488
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:22,920
so given that I have this like training

489
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:24,450
set now I can actually throw as a

490
00:23:24,450 --> 00:23:25,890
tensorflow which would also be a whole

491
00:23:25,890 --> 00:23:29,160
lot of fun the other things I want to

492
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,809
highlight really quickly are other

493
00:23:30,809 --> 00:23:32,190
versions of things that have kind of

494
00:23:32,190 --> 00:23:33,750
built actually did not build medium

495
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:36,870
snowflake thing but so this is actually

496
00:23:36,870 --> 00:23:38,250
a totally different game this is like a

497
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:41,490
crazy game where you have crazy dice you

498
00:23:41,490 --> 00:23:43,950
have figures and you kind of build your

499
00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:45,120
character up over time

500
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,530
one thing about building your characters

501
00:23:46,530 --> 00:23:47,670
you're gonna have these like item buys

502
00:23:47,670 --> 00:23:49,410
and you're trying to figure out what use

503
00:23:49,410 --> 00:23:52,530
is better than 44 that's 11 they use

504
00:23:52,530 --> 00:23:55,380
random dice they look the same so I

505
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:58,200
decided I'm gonna root for this too so

506
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:00,480
I'm gonna run simulations against all of

507
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,370
this and these are damage curves for

508
00:24:02,370 --> 00:24:04,590
each of these weapons at different

509
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:07,620
distances another example that I want to

510
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:08,730
highlight is actually stool called

511
00:24:08,730 --> 00:24:11,610
medium or a cool called snowflake from

512
00:24:11,610 --> 00:24:13,320
medium so this is actually a

513
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:14,840
visualization of the engineering ladder

514
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:17,190
this is a little bit looser as far as

515
00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:18,780
like actual tools to hack your life with

516
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:20,610
but to me this is a tool that you can

517
00:24:20,610 --> 00:24:23,400
use to hack your career with so you can

518
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,960
kind of see where you sit on their

519
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,179
ladder for here seriously is really good

520
00:24:27,179 --> 00:24:29,429
at project management and initiative and

521
00:24:29,429 --> 00:24:33,090
accomplishment but she is very low on

522
00:24:33,090 --> 00:24:36,240
the community scale which probably stop

523
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:39,420
killing people and blowing them up but

524
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:41,130
she can like have a one-on-one with her

525
00:24:41,130 --> 00:24:42,240
manager which I don't think she has a

526
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:45,000
manager and they can talk about how you

527
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,800
know she could probably target just

528
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,570
doing this easy zero to one on

529
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:50,520
well-being and like this is zero to one

530
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:52,020
on community and she's actually gone up

531
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:55,110
a level so this is just a tool that I

532
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:58,230
feel like you can you can basically very

533
00:24:58,230 --> 00:25:00,690
quickly figure out like if you've ever

534
00:25:00,690 --> 00:25:01,890
had a one don't want your manager and

535
00:25:01,890 --> 00:25:02,790
you're trying to figure out like it

536
00:25:02,790 --> 00:25:03,760
what's the next best

537
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:06,100
for me to work on what would happen if I

538
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:07,780
like just got really good at some of

539
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:08,830
these other things where would that put

540
00:25:08,830 --> 00:25:13,570
me this answers it for you so yeah so

541
00:25:13,570 --> 00:25:17,770
again why I again love cheating and

542
00:25:17,770 --> 00:25:20,560
mischief and just solving problems in

543
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:23,620
ways that shouldn't be solved and I feel

544
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:25,900
like it leads the basic innovation so

545
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:27,520
that's kind of why I hope I've inspired

546
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:30,520
you to actually build something and kind

547
