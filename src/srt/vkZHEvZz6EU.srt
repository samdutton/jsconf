00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:30,399
hi everyone so yeah my name is Bryan

11
00:00:30,399 --> 00:00:32,200
Hughes you can find me everywhere online

12
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:34,809
at NAB rias Twitter github things like

13
00:00:34,809 --> 00:00:37,420
that yeah I work at Microsoft so today

14
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:39,760
I'm gonna be talking about anxiety and

15
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:41,559
queerness and kind of how that manifests

16
00:00:41,559 --> 00:00:43,600
myself and this like little app that I

17
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,560
built to help me with it first up if

18
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:50,260
that's going to work do it there we go

19
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:52,210
content warnings I am gonna be talking

20
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:53,770
of course about mental illness I'm going

21
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:56,050
to talking about homophobia growing up

22
00:00:56,050 --> 00:00:58,329
queer in the south so it's gonna be an

23
00:00:58,329 --> 00:01:02,670
intense talk but yeah so anxiety brain

24
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:06,360
all right I am giving up on that thing

25
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:09,369
so yeah I deal with a lot of anxiety

26
00:01:09,369 --> 00:01:11,200
it's something I've dealt with for a

27
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,820
long time although it took me a while to

28
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:15,909
realize it for a lot of reasons but is

29
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:18,040
something where like my anxiety is kind

30
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:19,930
of middle of the road I would say I

31
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:21,820
definitely know people who deal who deal

32
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:23,200
with anxiety that's a lot less than me

33
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,490
but also people deal with it and it's a

34
00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:27,010
lot more than me it's enough that I am

35
00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:28,210
in therapy it's something I have to

36
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:31,270
manage and it manifests in a lot of

37
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:32,770
different ways like mental illness for

38
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:34,479
most people it's always a little bit

39
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:37,119
different and so for me one of the big

40
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:39,610
things the way that anxiety manifests is

41
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:41,740
that I'm really bad about keeping in

42
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:43,360
touch with people I really good about

43
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,799
being present like in the moment like

44
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:45,939
you know talking to you and I think I

45
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:47,380
talked with a bunch of you last night

46
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:49,659
and like I'm great at that when it comes

47
00:01:49,659 --> 00:01:51,700
time to like reach out over text or DM

48
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:53,619
email whatever you know just really

49
00:01:53,619 --> 00:01:55,479
working on that relationship I'm bad at

50
00:01:55,479 --> 00:01:57,640
it and it comes from social anxiety

51
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:01,090
ultimately and a few other things so I

52
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:03,070
decided that this was an area where tech

53
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:04,810
can help like the thing about mental

54
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:07,000
illness is we're constantly managing it

55
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,679
you know it's not something that you

56
00:02:08,679 --> 00:02:09,970
take a pill and it's fixed it's

57
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:11,819
something that we have to work on and

58
00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:14,110
sometimes we need tools to help us with

59
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:15,670
it and so I wrote this tool to help me

60
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:18,280
with this one very specific aspect of my

61
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,770
anxiety so I call a contact scheduler

62
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:22,239
I'm not particularly good at naming

63
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:23,890
things so it's pretty functional but it

64
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:24,580
works it

65
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:27,400
open source online GPL license you can

66
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,470
check it out so I created this I had a

67
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:31,210
couple of design goals in mind to make

68
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:33,310
sure that it worked really well the

69
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:34,870
first thing that need to be as automated

70
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:37,900
as possible any time I have to go in and

71
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:39,670
do a thing that's a chance that I won't

72
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:41,830
do that thing and I found like I tried

73
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:42,910
in the past using just like a normal

74
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:44,890
calendar to add an entry to like hey

75
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:47,100
reach out to this person never works

76
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:49,210
largely because I forgot to just add

77
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:50,740
stuff to it you know there was a human

78
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:52,420
error element of it so I needed to

79
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:54,700
remove as much of that as possible and

80
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:55,780
the next one is that it needs to be

81
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:58,720
scheduled aware you know if I ever get a

82
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,370
notification saying hey do this thing

83
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:01,720
and I'm in the middle of like a meeting

84
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,880
that makes my anxiety worse not better

85
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,800
so a needs to be able to figure out like

86
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,630
when is actually a good time to tell me

87
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:08,080
about it

88
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,450
and then finally it needs to be low

89
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:12,730
stakes like the thing about anxiety is

90
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:15,190
it ratchets up pressure and then

91
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:16,420
whenever something else is pressuring it

92
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:17,800
gets worse and it gets into a bit of

93
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,810
this cycle so it needs to be really low

94
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:22,510
stakes so when I designed it it looks

95
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:24,670
kind of like this there are three tabs

96
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:27,160
to it there's sort of a Home tab this

97
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,959
contacts having a calendar tab so on the

98
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:31,600
context tab I add in all the people I

99
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,610
want to keep in touch with using

100
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:35,230
Futurama characters here because I like

101
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:36,910
to use them as placeholders and you

102
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:38,920
notice this is a very simple UI there's

103
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,239
very very little to it and that is

104
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:41,470
actually by design

105
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:43,540
this is still kind of beta so it's

106
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:45,100
missing some features but this page is

107
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:49,330
complete so in this page which I see is

108
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:51,010
not on the monitor right now it's you

109
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:52,930
got a list of names and you add just a

110
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:54,310
name and half-free clear you want to

111
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:56,140
reach out to them very simple and that's

112
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:59,290
by design it does the rest for me and so

113
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:01,120
then on the home page each week it's

114
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,530
going to create a queue of people for me

115
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:03,610
to reach out to you know the sort of

116
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:05,200
interspersed set throughout the week and

117
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,180
it does it using a variety of pieces of

118
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:09,130
information you know how often I reach

119
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:10,480
out to someone when I last reached out

120
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,400
to them and a few other heuristics going

121
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,739
into it and so it's time to reach out to

122
00:04:14,739 --> 00:04:16,810
someone it gives me a notification that

123
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:19,720
looks like this now if you start looking

124
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,830
at this this is actually kind of

125
00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:22,360
different than a typical notification

126
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,550
even that may not be quite obvious the

127
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:26,050
biggest thing is compared to a calendar

128
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:28,600
there is no snooze or dismiss by design

129
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:31,450
so what I learned with a calendar is the

130
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:33,370
way it interacts with my anxiety and I

131
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:35,410
think a lot of people's anxiety is we

132
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:37,060
get a notification especially a calendar

133
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:38,320
notification and there's this

134
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,930
that we have to do it right then it's

135
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:42,640
like you must do this thing at this

136
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:43,960
moment I'm gonna keep bothering you

137
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:44,860
until you do

138
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:47,170
and that really spikes anxiety as it

139
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:48,730
turns out like that is a UI pattern that

140
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:52,120
is bad for anxiety and now if you have a

141
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,080
meeting you have to get two at a time

142
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,760
that's just the nature of it but I like

143
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,050
reaching out to someone it doesn't

144
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:57,520
matter if I do it now versus a half hour

145
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,840
from now it's just matters that I reach

146
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,780
out to that person so I changed this so

147
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:03,760
that there is no snooze and dismiss and

148
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:06,490
it's kind of an asynchronous UI pattern

149
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:09,370
this pops up for like 15 seconds and

150
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:10,630
then goes away on its own

151
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:12,700
so it's like an auto snooze and that's

152
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:14,380
intentionally a very short period of

153
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:16,150
time so that actually can't respond to

154
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:17,770
it in that period of time the idea is it

155
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:19,870
pops up it gets the idea in my head like

156
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:21,070
oh yeah I need to reach out to this

157
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:22,390
person then goes away and this

158
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:24,160
eventually I'll get around to it you

159
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,660
know when I have a few minutes but it's

160
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:27,520
there in my brain already it's kind of

161
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,960
taking up space and I remember to do it

162
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,060
and so whenever I do reach out to them I

163
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:32,380
actually have to wait for this to pop up

164
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:34,180
again and then that's when I hit respond

165
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:35,830
and then it will move on to the next

166
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:38,410
person sometimes there can be anxiety

167
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:40,000
around reaching out to a specific person

168
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,650
maybe I have to have a really difficult

169
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:43,270
conversation with them or it's been a

170
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:44,560
long time since I reached out to them

171
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,390
and I'm feeling anxious about the fact

172
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:47,920
that I haven't reached out to them so

173
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,240
sometimes just saying like okay I'm not

174
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,290
gonna do this person right now I'll

175
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:51,670
reach out to someone else first that can

176
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:53,650
kind of help to just like ease the

177
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:55,210
anxiety and feel me it give me a little

178
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:57,400
more prep to do it again so that's how

179
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,900
that works you know remix in this

180
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:01,000
notification pattern has helped a lot

181
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,530
and like this is still beta stage like

182
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:04,920
this is not a particularly good

183
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:07,150
mechanism actually you know it can be a

184
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:09,250
lot better but it's already better than

185
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:11,350
what we have and I don't say this

186
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:12,700
because like I have some insight it I'm

187
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:14,380
actually a pretty bad UI UX designer

188
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:15,430
it's just that I don't think anyone's

189
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:18,340
ever tried to create a UI that works

190
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:20,350
with people's anxiety and and a little

191
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:21,700
bit I've been using this so far it has

192
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:23,110
made a difference so I think there's

193
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:27,010
something to it and so I implemented

194
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:29,470
this using electrons AS type script

195
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:31,060
because I love type script you know go

196
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:32,230
figure working for Microsoft

197
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:34,510
I used SQLite to store all the data in

198
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:35,860
it that way it's on a file on your

199
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:37,570
laptop and you have control over that

200
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:39,340
you know this is ultima mapping

201
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:40,630
relationships so that is really

202
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:43,240
important private information and so you

203
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,290
know i don't want to deal with the

204
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:45,930
privacy issues of going into the cloud

205
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:48,850
and then finally i'm not there yet but i

206
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:50,590
will be using the Microsoft graph API to

207
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:52,060
connect to my calendars in

208
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:55,380
during our proper times now you might be

209
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:57,940
thinking to yourself that like wait did

210
00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:00,550
Brian just finish talking about his app

211
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:02,440
in a you know 35 minute sock in the

212
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:05,380
first like ten minutes or so yes that is

213
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:07,780
exactly what I did the reason for that

214
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:11,050
is mental health doesn't exist in a

215
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:13,060
vacuum and there's always more to the

216
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:13,680
story

217
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,510
my mental held you know anxiety isn't

218
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:18,220
this like thing that exists in a

219
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:20,350
crystalline form under a glass jar

220
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:22,270
somewhere it is intertwined with

221
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:25,990
everything else in my life and so to

222
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:27,490
understand my anxiety you kind of have

223
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:31,330
to understand where I came from and that

224
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:35,620
truth is I am a bisexual polyamorous

225
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:37,540
atheist who's born and raised in various

226
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:40,120
parts of Texas in New Mexico not called

227
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:46,180
Austin and so I was born in Houston

228
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:49,270
Texas in 1982 now that actually means

229
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:51,070
that I'm older than I look I'm older

230
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:52,570
than you probably think I am I am

231
00:07:52,570 --> 00:07:54,010
technically a gen Xer according to

232
00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:56,080
pretty much every definition and that

233
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:59,289
actually matters as it turns out so the

234
00:07:59,289 --> 00:08:00,550
born in Houston lived there for three

235
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:02,350
years moved to a place in Texas or in

236
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:03,669
New Mexico sorry called Truth or

237
00:08:03,669 --> 00:08:06,280
Consequences that one little star kind

238
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:09,610
of a New Mexico side and I lived there

239
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:10,960
for like four years so then I moved to

240
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,970
Denton Texas which is in the north part

241
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:14,740
of the dallas-fort Worth Metroplex and I

242
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:17,410
spent all of my adolescence there all

243
00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:18,669
the way through high school and then I

244
00:08:18,669 --> 00:08:21,789
went to college in Lubbock Texas now

245
00:08:21,789 --> 00:08:25,260
taxes in general is a strange place

246
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:28,479
suffice to say and Denton is a strange

247
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:30,310
place inside of a strange state as is

248
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:33,550
Lubbock so Texas the thing is known for

249
00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:34,750
well one of the things that's known for

250
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:35,830
is that there's a university there

251
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:37,200
called the University of North Texas

252
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,880
turns out they have the number two jazz

253
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:42,159
program in the nation you know now

254
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:43,599
actually my family did that's why I

255
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:44,890
removed my dad wanted to go back to

256
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:48,430
school but outside of Texas it's on the

257
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:49,660
very northern part of the metric so it's

258
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:53,200
surrounded by farmland and this town was

259
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,910
basically had this very tiny artistic

260
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:56,830
core and then a bunch of that was

261
00:08:56,830 --> 00:08:58,630
liberal and a lot of really conservative

262
00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:00,010
folks right around it we're kind of all

263
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:02,080
mixed together then Lubbock though was

264
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,990
sort of the opposite of that Lubbock

265
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:07,270
when I lived there was rated as the

266
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:09,220
second most conservative city in the

267
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:11,230
nation with a population over like a

268
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:14,260
hundred thousand I think so that is more

269
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:17,350
what you would expect so I'm giving you

270
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:18,790
this idea in your head like I grew up in

271
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:21,640
Texas career person from there you might

272
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:22,840
have to be thinking you know what that's

273
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:25,200
like but you're probably wrong actually

274
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,160
yes these places are incredibly

275
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:29,530
conservative but it doesn't manifest the

276
00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:31,210
way most liberal folks think and this is

277
00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:32,380
a struggle that I have trying to

278
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:34,570
describe it all the time so most people

279
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:37,450
think that like homophobia racism things

280
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:38,440
like that in the south

281
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,720
looks like KKK members burning crosses

282
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,640
or the Westboro Baptist Church picketing

283
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,110
funerals with signs saying that people

284
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:47,110
like me are going to hell that exists

285
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:50,290
but it's a very very tiny proportion

286
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:52,570
like there's only 5,000 KKK members in

287
00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:55,380
the entire United States and that's a

288
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:58,180
super tiny fraction of the south because

289
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:00,540
the thing is most big between the south

290
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:03,640
doesn't look like overt violence it's a

291
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:06,090
lot more subtle and a lot more pervasive

292
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:09,190
like the south is I think more racist

293
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:11,410
and homophobic and everything else and

294
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:13,660
you think it is but not in the way you

295
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:17,560
think it is at all and unfortunately

296
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:19,630
like the thing that I see about this all

297
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:21,250
the time is there's this strong man

298
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:22,720
construction created of the south

299
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:26,740
and what I always see especially white

300
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:28,270
liberal folks doing with this is they

301
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:30,130
say like this is what bigotry looks like

302
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:32,200
this is what racism looks like so I'm

303
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,430
not racist because I'm nothing like this

304
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:35,980
thing I just made up and that's actually

305
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:38,500
how this conversation goes down so I've

306
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:39,970
also lived in San Island San Francisco

307
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:41,050
now and I lived there for almost a

308
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:43,240
decade so I know San Francisco as well

309
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:46,630
and the truth is San Francisco is racist

310
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:49,960
as seriously look at the history of

311
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:52,240
it or look at the current numbers on it

312
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,070
San Francisco the population of San

313
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:56,590
Francisco is only 3% african-american

314
00:10:56,590 --> 00:10:59,020
that is the lowest of any major city in

315
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:02,680
the entire United States by far like San

316
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:03,970
Francisco managed to somehow beat up

317
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:06,700
Phoenix Arizona for having fewer

318
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:09,000
african-american folks

319
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,780
Arizona

320
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:14,420
and and this is not an accident either

321
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:16,790
if you look at the history of it San

322
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:18,880
Francisco actively chased out

323
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:23,120
african-americans and we see this going

324
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,340
on today

325
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:27,920
and the thing is is that like bigotry in

326
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,270
the South doesn't look that different

327
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:32,210
than bigotry in the West Coast and for

328
00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:33,710
me what that meant growing up though is

329
00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:35,540
like so Texas is a weird thing it's not

330
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:37,720
quite the south it's like the south

331
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:40,520
sibling a younger sibling in a way and

332
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:42,380
it gets a lot of its culture from the

333
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:44,360
south later also get some culture from

334
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:46,370
the Midwest and so what this means in

335
00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:48,110
culture especially when I was growing up

336
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:50,870
is that you just didn't talk about

337
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:53,270
anything controversial that was like a

338
00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:56,300
major social faux pas it was out of turn

339
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:58,060
you just didn't do it

340
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:01,270
the thing is that when I was growing up

341
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:03,740
queerness was controversial so you

342
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:08,180
didn't talk about it ever and like this

343
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:11,180
is it's especially complicated for me

344
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:14,320
because I'm bisexual I'm not gay and

345
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,580
there is a bit of a difference and

346
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:18,890
growing up I knew that I was interested

347
00:12:18,890 --> 00:12:23,839
in women dot dot dot but like yeah

348
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:25,460
growing up especially when I was young

349
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:26,960
like I grew up with that Internet the

350
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,280
internet didn't come around until I was

351
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:30,110
in middle school and even back then it

352
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:32,240
was not like we had today there wasn't a

353
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,950
way for me to find community online

354
00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:35,930
there wasn't a way for me to research

355
00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:37,430
even what Karina's was like that just

356
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:39,170
didn't exist and there wasn't

357
00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:41,630
representation in media either like Will

358
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:43,100
& Grace when come on until I was in high

359
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:44,450
school career I for the straight guy

360
00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:46,220
it's original main one come on till I

361
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:49,040
was in college like I had no role models

362
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,690
in media I didn't even know what

363
00:12:50,690 --> 00:12:52,760
bisexuality was until like my junior in

364
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,950
high school and I am bi like I didn't

365
00:12:54,950 --> 00:13:01,000
know what I was and and it's not like

366
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,110
people not talking about this was like

367
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:04,640
oh it's just not a big deal we're not

368
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:05,720
gonna talk about no this was the

369
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:07,550
elephant in the room that everyone knew

370
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:09,950
was there and you could feel it like I

371
00:13:09,950 --> 00:13:12,460
could feel the presence of it growing up

372
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:14,570
but I didn't know what it was I just

373
00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:16,280
knew there was something and I knew that

374
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:18,680
something involved me and not just

375
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:21,170
because how I felt but because of how

376
00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:23,990
others felt like I knew I was somehow

377
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:25,110
other

378
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:26,279
going up and not just in that like

379
00:13:26,279 --> 00:13:28,440
teenage angsty no one understands me way

380
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,209
like we all go through that that's not

381
00:13:30,209 --> 00:13:31,620
what I'm talking about this is something

382
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:34,019
where I knew others were treating me

383
00:13:34,019 --> 00:13:40,980
like and like that sunk in I think about

384
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:42,029
growing up queer is like I mean

385
00:13:42,029 --> 00:13:43,649
everyone's story is different and it

386
00:13:43,649 --> 00:13:45,360
depends a lot on the culture we grow

387
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,610
around up and but pretty much all of us

388
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:50,220
deal with homophobia growing up and we

389
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:52,440
internalize it because when we're young

390
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,910
when we're kids before we hit puberty

391
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:56,880
very very few of us actually know that

392
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:57,810
we're queer

393
00:13:57,810 --> 00:13:59,880
like that's something that usually we

394
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,610
have to get to puberty to find out not

395
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:04,560
always but usually and so what happens

396
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:05,790
growing up when we grow up in these

397
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:07,950
environments we grow up in a place where

398
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:09,660
homophobia is the norm and we learned

399
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:12,600
that first we learn that there's

400
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,339
something wrong with being queer and

401
00:14:14,339 --> 00:14:17,970
later we find out that we are queer and

402
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:20,040
we can't just turn that switch off so we

403
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,570
internalize it that's what we mean when

404
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:23,100
we say internalized homophobia or

405
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:25,500
internalized racism or anything else is

406
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:28,260
that we learn what the culture wants

407
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:30,899
before we learn what we are and then we

408
00:14:30,899 --> 00:14:33,449
have to reconcile that somehow in a lot

409
00:14:33,449 --> 00:14:35,730
of places where homophobia looks like

410
00:14:35,730 --> 00:14:38,220
violence which is a lot of places that

411
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:40,170
gets internalized as hatred and

412
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:43,230
self-loathing but like that wasn't

413
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:45,570
exactly what I dealt with growing up and

414
00:14:45,570 --> 00:14:46,680
for a long time I actually thought that

415
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,029
I just somehow like dodged a bullet with

416
00:14:48,029 --> 00:14:50,310
this that somehow I was like a lucky one

417
00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:52,110
because I don't have that kind of

418
00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:54,570
internalized homophobia but it is there

419
00:14:54,570 --> 00:14:55,500
and this is something I've learned

420
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:58,170
recently is that for me internalized

421
00:14:58,170 --> 00:15:00,779
homophobia doesn't look like violence

422
00:15:00,779 --> 00:15:03,449
and hate it looks like self-denial and

423
00:15:03,449 --> 00:15:06,029
gaslighting because that's what happened

424
00:15:06,029 --> 00:15:08,610
when I was a kid the oppression of

425
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:11,040
knowledge was so thorough that I didn't

426
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,050
even know there was something for me to

427
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:14,880
find out about myself I knew there was

428
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,740
something but I didn't know what and I

429
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:18,360
didn't have the tools to find it out and

430
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:20,970
no one to show me the way so that part

431
00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:24,560
of me just got cut off and put in a box

432
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,670
because I knew what's attracted women I

433
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:28,110
did kind of figure out eventually that

434
00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:30,720
like being gay was a thing once again I

435
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,910
knew I wasn't gay and at the time that

436
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:34,319
was the only thing that got in about

437
00:15:34,319 --> 00:15:35,790
queerness at all at least some men and

438
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:38,520
so I knew I wasn't gay but I knew there

439
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,160
was something else

440
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:40,779
so I just thought maybe I was broken

441
00:15:40,779 --> 00:15:42,129
like there was a crossed wire or

442
00:15:42,129 --> 00:15:45,730
something in my brain and like that got

443
00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:47,379
internalized that just oh there's this

444
00:15:47,379 --> 00:15:48,940
weird thing going on but like the

445
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:50,410
culture we don't talk about it so I'm

446
00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:52,480
just gonna shove it aside and not think

447
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,670
about it and I did that to myself like

448
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:58,899
this is by erasure pure and simple and I

449
00:15:58,899 --> 00:16:01,269
erase myself and I'm not the only one

450
00:16:01,269 --> 00:16:03,730
this is a very common story among by

451
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:10,750
folks very common and so I knew I had to

452
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:12,250
get out of Texas though especially once

453
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:13,779
again to college I kind of started

454
00:16:13,779 --> 00:16:15,699
figuring some of this out like I didn't

455
00:16:15,699 --> 00:16:17,800
know this in high school I mean I knew

456
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:20,860
there was something I knew yeah I knew

457
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:23,129
the way other people treated me I knew

458
00:16:23,129 --> 00:16:25,750
when Matthew Shepard was tortured and

459
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:28,389
murdered for being gay that that struck

460
00:16:28,389 --> 00:16:30,189
a chord me that I didn't understand but

461
00:16:30,189 --> 00:16:33,699
I knew I was afraid like that was high

462
00:16:33,699 --> 00:16:35,680
school for me and then college wasn't

463
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,740
much better I started figuring this out

464
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:39,910
just because I'm getting older but now

465
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:41,529
is in a much much more conservative

466
00:16:41,529 --> 00:16:43,149
place the kind of place where it's not

467
00:16:43,149 --> 00:16:44,470
just everyone is Christian that's just

468
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:47,019
the way it is in Texas but this place it

469
00:16:47,019 --> 00:16:48,519
was like at least half of the city was

470
00:16:48,519 --> 00:16:50,500
young earth creationist evangelical

471
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:53,620
style of Christianity and so like living

472
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:55,779
in that even more press and I just I had

473
00:16:55,779 --> 00:16:57,850
to cut that side off for me in order to

474
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:59,709
keep myself safe and I know now that

475
00:16:59,709 --> 00:17:01,449
what I did was I put myself in the

476
00:17:01,449 --> 00:17:03,009
closet without even knowing that closet

477
00:17:03,009 --> 00:17:06,449
was there and I stayed in it for decades

478
00:17:06,449 --> 00:17:10,000
I'm in my late 30s now getting there and

479
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,150
so I'm starting to really work on this

480
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:14,140
and like I said I've been at San

481
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:15,760
Francisco for a decade and so you might

482
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,079
think okay I moved to San Francisco

483
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:18,339
which is a you know a great place for

484
00:17:18,339 --> 00:17:21,909
queer folks it really is and you would

485
00:17:21,909 --> 00:17:23,470
think that that would just fix it but it

486
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:26,500
didn't it's not just about escape

487
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,059
getting physically away from where

488
00:17:28,059 --> 00:17:29,080
you're out but you have to get away from

489
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:32,140
it mentally too and I'm still stuck

490
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:36,370
there in a lot of ways and of course see

491
00:17:36,370 --> 00:17:39,010
like I said San Francisco is not perfect

492
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:41,230
far from it like what I have learned you

493
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:43,059
know I do have a lot of street friends

494
00:17:43,059 --> 00:17:44,799
historically the majority of my friends

495
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:46,809
have been straight and in San Francisco

496
00:17:46,809 --> 00:17:48,190
I learned that you know it's a very

497
00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:50,380
accepting welcoming place for queer

498
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:51,630
folks but

499
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:53,100
as long as you stay in line you know

500
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:54,300
there's certain ways that will they

501
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:57,180
expect us to express our queerness but

502
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:59,370
as soon as we start calling out

503
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:00,720
on the part of our straight friends

504
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,010
there in San Francisco all of a sudden

505
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:04,080
then we become the device the divisive

506
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:04,440
ones

507
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:06,210
we're the ones causing trouble why don't

508
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:08,340
we just all get along and this isn't

509
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:09,660
just queer folks this happens to you by

510
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:11,040
the way this is people of colors the

511
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:12,690
disabled this is the same story being

512
00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:15,720
told over and over again even in liberal

513
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:22,020
areas and even in activist circles like

514
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:23,760
so I'm something of an activist if you

515
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:24,870
follow me online you might have seen

516
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:25,860
some of the things I've done I was

517
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:27,180
involved in the node.js project for a

518
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:28,590
long time trying to change things there

519
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:30,660
and I've done a few other things more

520
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:34,200
recently and activism is a it's a weird

521
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:38,040
weird thing it's like we tend to think

522
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:39,360
of activism I was like oh I'm gonna go

523
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,010
protest as family go hold a sign and

524
00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:42,690
chant and that is a part of it that's an

525
00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:44,370
important part of activism but it's just

526
00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:46,590
one piece a lot of the other work we

527
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:47,970
have to do is more diplomacy and

528
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:49,410
politics and like that's what I did

529
00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:51,540
that's the style I did and what I didn't

530
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:52,950
know going in those when you do that

531
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:54,990
you're not calling out someone on the

532
00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:56,490
other side of a line who you don't know

533
00:18:56,490 --> 00:18:58,680
they're faceless and nameless you're

534
00:18:58,680 --> 00:18:59,970
calling out your colleagues you're

535
00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:03,690
calling out your friends and that in

536
00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:06,360
some ways made my night in some ways it

537
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:08,370
absolutely made my anxiety worse you

538
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:10,350
know my anxiety comes from growing up it

539
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:11,790
comes from not being able to trust

540
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:12,300
people

541
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:13,950
it comes from keeping people at a

542
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:15,570
distance because that's how I stay safe

543
00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:18,360
and I still struggle to trust people I

544
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:20,400
still struggle to open up a lot like I'm

545
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,500
an incredibly difficult person to get to

546
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:28,620
know I really am and it's not a great

547
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:31,800
thing for me I know that in activism in

548
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,870
some ways has made this worse because I

549
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:35,970
had to work with colleagues and friends

550
00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:37,770
people that were causing problems saying

551
00:19:37,770 --> 00:19:39,990
hey you're being an asshole but also

552
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:44,070
people who I saw being hurt and one of

553
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:45,270
the hardest things I've ever had to do

554
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:46,800
was in the know project I remember this

555
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:49,590
vividly having to tell people I care a

556
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:51,930
lot about who were being hurt that I

557
00:19:51,930 --> 00:19:53,580
can't do anything for you right now

558
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:56,550
because if I do it'll make things worse

559
00:19:56,550 --> 00:19:58,080
and we're gonna lose whatever chance we

560
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,390
had and I think that made that even

561
00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:01,560
harder was a few months later when I

562
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:03,480
thought we had our chance tried it and

563
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:05,799
we failed anyways it only proved me

564
00:20:05,799 --> 00:20:08,379
right to tell these people that I can't

565
00:20:08,379 --> 00:20:13,950
help you in that it's hard still

566
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:16,720
and it just it draw it has pulled me

567
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:20,889
away from people even more and so yeah

568
00:20:20,889 --> 00:20:23,110
I'm anxious all the time because I have

569
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:26,350
to deal with this kind of it never

570
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:27,429
stops

571
00:20:27,429 --> 00:20:28,840
like most of the time it's just a low

572
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:31,059
hum in the background you know something

573
00:20:31,059 --> 00:20:32,919
I just kind of keeps me on edge keeps me

574
00:20:32,919 --> 00:20:34,299
hanging perhaps a bit too much from a

575
00:20:34,299 --> 00:20:35,590
perfectionist but you know it still

576
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:38,440
works well or it works I can deal with

577
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:40,200
it easily enough it's not a big deal

578
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:43,509
most of the time then there's those

579
00:20:43,509 --> 00:20:47,019
other times where my anxiety gets bad

580
00:20:47,019 --> 00:20:49,330
enough that I can't work like I can't

581
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:51,299
really maintain relationships

582
00:20:51,299 --> 00:20:53,619
thank God I can work from home which by

583
00:20:53,619 --> 00:20:54,789
the way pro tip for anyone who has

584
00:20:54,789 --> 00:20:56,499
control over this if you want to help

585
00:20:56,499 --> 00:20:58,659
people with mental health allow them to

586
00:20:58,659 --> 00:21:05,830
work from home because if you could be

587
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:07,359
on the fly on the wall on my really

588
00:21:07,359 --> 00:21:09,609
really bad anxieties you see me pacing

589
00:21:09,609 --> 00:21:12,220
my apartment I cannot sit still I cannot

590
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:14,619
focus and being at home does help though

591
00:21:14,619 --> 00:21:16,299
because of it at least it's in a calm

592
00:21:16,299 --> 00:21:21,369
comfortable place but it's always there

593
00:21:21,369 --> 00:21:22,690
even when it's not that and thankfully

594
00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:25,330
that's rare just you know half a dozen

595
00:21:25,330 --> 00:21:27,129
times a year maybe a dozen times a year

596
00:21:27,129 --> 00:21:29,889
like it's not that common at least

597
00:21:29,889 --> 00:21:31,749
doesn't feel that way to me but it

598
00:21:31,749 --> 00:21:35,379
happens the reverse is even rarer though

599
00:21:35,379 --> 00:21:37,929
on occasion my anxiety actually will

600
00:21:37,929 --> 00:21:39,759
completely go away it's usually fleeting

601
00:21:39,759 --> 00:21:43,389
just for a few minutes but I really love

602
00:21:43,389 --> 00:21:44,649
those moments because like for this

603
00:21:44,649 --> 00:21:46,989
brief moment I can see the kind of

604
00:21:46,989 --> 00:21:49,179
person I would be otherwise I could see

605
00:21:49,179 --> 00:21:53,139
who I would be without anxiety and I'm a

606
00:21:53,139 --> 00:21:55,480
much that that version of me is a much

607
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,999
better person I wish I could be that

608
00:21:57,999 --> 00:22:01,419
person all the time but I can't I was

609
00:22:01,419 --> 00:22:04,749
never given that choice growing up my

610
00:22:04,749 --> 00:22:06,879
defense mechanisms were honed to a fine

611
00:22:06,879 --> 00:22:10,600
point I had to like and this is the

612
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:12,159
truth that a lot of queer people grow up

613
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:14,070
especially when we grow up alone without

614
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:18,090
support as it hardens us

615
00:22:18,090 --> 00:22:20,190
we don't have a choice in this either

616
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:23,380
and we don't know how to do it in ways

617
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:24,610
that are healthy either because we have

618
00:22:24,610 --> 00:22:26,740
to learn it on our own we don't have

619
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:28,120
people who actually understand this we

620
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:29,200
don't have therapists to talk to

621
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,750
especially in conservative places today

622
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:33,490
and a lot of Kurt's Irvington places

623
00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:36,400
therapists still treat weirdness as a

624
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,020
mental illness and for a long time it

625
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:39,760
was officially classified as a mental

626
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:42,520
illness but that just makes things worse

627
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:46,690
it's not true obviously and it's harmful

628
00:22:46,690 --> 00:22:52,900
it's hurtful and so like I'm just I'm

629
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:55,870
left dealing with this in a lot of ways

630
00:22:55,870 --> 00:22:59,140
it feels like it feels like a part of my

631
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:01,090
life was stolen from me honestly like I

632
00:23:01,090 --> 00:23:03,340
am Who I am because of things outside my

633
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:04,750
control that I never had control over

634
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:06,490
and the fact that it was so subtle

635
00:23:06,490 --> 00:23:07,840
growing up it was never explicitly

636
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:10,210
mentioned I didn't know there's always

637
00:23:10,210 --> 00:23:12,190
this thing conservatives like to say

638
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:13,750
queer people oh you're just confused

639
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:14,890
well you know what your goddamn

640
00:23:14,890 --> 00:23:16,450
right I was confused because you made me

641
00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:19,360
confused you never allowed me to gain

642
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:25,929
clarity and that is harmful like being

643
00:23:25,929 --> 00:23:27,970
stuck in a closet you don't even know is

644
00:23:27,970 --> 00:23:30,520
there but you know the feeling of it you

645
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:33,520
know that shame coming in from it that

646
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:41,950
lasts that sticks and like I think I'm

647
00:23:41,950 --> 00:23:43,210
gonna be this way the rest of my life I

648
00:23:43,210 --> 00:23:45,400
really do I'm getting better like I said

649
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,900
I've been in therapy and that it does

650
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:48,760
make a difference it really does help if

651
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,890
you are struggling get into therapy

652
00:23:50,890 --> 00:23:53,950
please it really does help I know it's

653
00:23:53,950 --> 00:23:56,679
scary I was terrified whenever I first

654
00:23:56,679 --> 00:23:59,590
got in but it really does help and make

655
00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:03,280
a difference we got to remember this and

656
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:04,840
we got to remember this in our cultures

657
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:06,880
and our companies that there are a lot

658
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,590
of people struggling with mental illness

659
00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:09,640
and that comes from a lot of places

660
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:12,160
that's always intertwined with something

661
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:15,790
else like for me whenever my anxiety

662
00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:17,800
spikes it's not like a random thing

663
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:18,940
that's unpredictable there's always

664
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:23,470
something that spikes it I mean a lot of

665
00:24:23,470 --> 00:24:24,460
times it actually comes back to

666
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:26,770
queerness in some way or fashion not

667
00:24:26,770 --> 00:24:28,150
always its creative sir activism at the

668
00:24:28,150 --> 00:24:29,910
very least I should say

669
00:24:29,910 --> 00:24:33,429
and it's hard and it's especially hard

670
00:24:33,429 --> 00:24:34,840
knowing that this isn't something that's

671
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,910
just in the past and done with like this

672
00:24:36,910 --> 00:24:40,600
is still going on I remember I had met

673
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:43,630
this one guy I'm at a conference and a

674
00:24:43,630 --> 00:24:45,160
much more conservative place a while ago

675
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:47,500
and he was from there he had just moved

676
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:49,390
to San Francisco like a couple months

677
00:24:49,390 --> 00:24:51,520
prior to the Castro he talked about how

678
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,710
excited he was to be there and how

679
00:24:53,710 --> 00:24:58,900
awesome it was and I saw myself in him

680
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:00,250
like I knew exactly where he's coming

681
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:01,540
from and what he was thinking

682
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:03,190
and when he said that he was excited to

683
00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:04,300
be there what he really meant was that

684
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:06,790
he finally felt safe and free to be

685
00:25:06,790 --> 00:25:09,940
himself but I know it's not quite that

686
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:11,980
simple I know you can't just flick a

687
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:14,140
switch on that and it's all better

688
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:19,990
I probably and I had the responsibility

689
00:25:19,990 --> 00:25:22,570
to tell him all of this I think but I

690
00:25:22,570 --> 00:25:25,410
just couldn't do it I just couldn't I

691
00:25:25,410 --> 00:25:28,120
couldn't bring myself to tell him that

692
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:31,720
like you're not out of the woods that

693
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:34,120
San Francisco isn't perfect that this is

694
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:37,600
going to haunt you I just I I couldn't

695
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,400
do that to him at that moment but it

696
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:44,380
sticks with me

697
00:25:44,390 --> 00:25:45,980
and I don't have an ending for the sock

698
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:49,610
by the way and not because I didn't get

699
00:25:49,610 --> 00:25:51,590
around to it like I do a lot of public

700
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:53,059
speaking I know how to formulate a talk

701
00:25:53,059 --> 00:25:54,559
I know how to do a plot structure I know

702
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:57,289
how to bring it in I don't have a talk

703
00:25:57,289 --> 00:25:59,000
for this the I don't have an ending for

704
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,019
this talk because I don't have an ending

705
00:26:00,019 --> 00:26:02,179
to my story a lot of times when I do

706
00:26:02,179 --> 00:26:03,529
culture talks I ended with a call to

707
00:26:03,529 --> 00:26:05,330
action I'm like you know if you could

708
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:07,490
all do one thing do this one thing it'll

709
00:26:07,490 --> 00:26:12,049
make things better there's no call to

710
00:26:12,049 --> 00:26:14,990
action for this like the damage has been

711
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:16,730
done I'm gonna be dealing with this for

712
00:26:16,730 --> 00:26:18,110
the rest of my life and queer people

713
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:20,120
today even younger than me are still

714
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,529
gonna be dealing with this for the rest

715
00:26:21,529 --> 00:26:23,960
of our lives there is no amount of

716
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,940
apology there was no amount of

717
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:28,250
reparations that can undo the damage

718
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:29,960
done in the past and this is not just

719
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:31,549
for queer folks this is for people of

720
00:26:31,549 --> 00:26:33,679
color this is for disabled folks for

721
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:39,570
anyone else on the outside of society

722
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:42,019
there is no call to action for this we

723
00:26:42,019 --> 00:26:44,510
have to do better but it can never be

724
00:26:44,510 --> 00:26:47,120
fixed especially while the damage is

725
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:52,190
still being done today but one thing I

726
00:26:52,190 --> 00:26:53,720
will say though is to anyone in the room

727
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:56,000
who is queer or listening online for the

728
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,590
recording of this especially if you're

729
00:26:57,590 --> 00:27:01,000
still in the closet find your community

730
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:05,269
you don't have to do it alone don't stay

731
00:27:05,269 --> 00:27:08,720
in the closet alone like I did because

732
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,789
that is the loneliest place in the world

733
00:27:10,789 --> 00:27:13,309
find your community find that support so

734
00:27:13,309 --> 00:27:18,299
that hopefully it can blunt the damage

735
00:27:18,309 --> 00:27:20,750
but you know it's already done for me so

736
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:23,990
I just have to keep dealing going

737
00:27:23,990 --> 00:27:27,110
forward and you know building tiny

738
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:28,730
little JavaScript apps tell me with the

739
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:33,059
details thank you
