00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:23,750

hi everyone thanks for being here before

2
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:26,000
I start going on about border-radius I

3
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,550
should introduce myself I guess I'm Lea

4
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:30,859
Veeru you can just call me Lia I work

5
00:00:30,859 --> 00:00:33,860
with w3c at developer relations and if

6
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:35,239
you've ever heard my name before it's

7
00:00:35,239 --> 00:00:36,769
probably one because of one of my

8
00:00:36,769 --> 00:00:38,930
open-source projects the most popular of

9
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:40,879
which our prism tablet and prefix-free

10
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:43,670
if I've had more time I would probably

11
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:45,979
go on about them but I should rush has

12
00:00:45,979 --> 00:00:49,699
anyone heard about them before quite a

13
00:00:49,699 --> 00:00:52,610
few people thank you so when I started

14
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:55,460
designing this talk I wanted to make to

15
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:57,500
design a creature that goes along with

16
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:00,170
it I kind of personify border-radius

17
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:01,670
and I thought how would border-radius

18
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:03,920
look if it was a cartoon character or

19
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,930
something like that and I I thought it

20
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:07,720
would look something like these

21
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:10,990
characters and children's books that

22
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:13,250
everybody thinks they're uncool and

23
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:15,500
nobody talks to them and everybody makes

24
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:16,729
fun of them because you know they're not

25
00:01:16,729 --> 00:01:19,130
cool but they end up saving the day and

26
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:23,170
being the hero so that's what I pictured

27
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:26,710
you might find it amusing but maybe not

28
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:30,439
so when you first meet it border-radius

29
00:01:30,439 --> 00:01:33,200
looks kind of like this you may have

30
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:37,579
seen it before I guess you have so there

31
00:01:37,579 --> 00:01:41,600
is one value it controls how curved the

32
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,759
corners are basically the radius of the

33
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:47,600
semicircle at those corners and if you

34
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,189
increase the value that radius increases

35
00:01:49,189 --> 00:01:52,219
and if you decrease it it decreases as

36
00:01:52,219 --> 00:01:55,369
well and you might have heard about how

37
00:01:55,369 --> 00:01:57,020
great its browser support is you don't

38
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:58,869
even need to use prefixes anymore

39
00:01:58,869 --> 00:02:01,159
although I and you didn't you never

40
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:03,049
needed to use prefixes in operand ie

41
00:02:03,049 --> 00:02:04,759
although I've seen monstrosities like

42
00:02:04,759 --> 00:02:06,770
that like Oh border radius or m/s border

43
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:10,039
radius but those things never existed so

44
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:12,560
yeah that's all there is to it to border

45
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,840
radius like there's nothing else to know

46
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:15,290
about it

47
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:17,690
so thanks for coming enjoy your lunch

48
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:19,820
bye bye

49
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:22,650
wait a second I think I had more things

50
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:26,880
to say yeah cuz like if if that's all

51
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,770
what Irenaeus is about why does it need

52
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:30,630
six pages of the specification to

53
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:33,440
describe it it seems pretty simple right

54
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,570
so one thing is that you can have

55
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:37,710
different radius per corner I'm sure

56
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:40,920
most of you have seen that before so you

57
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:43,140
can have two three or four lengths if

58
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:44,850
you have one it controls the radius

59
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:49,770
where all corners if you have two the

60
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:52,050
first one controls the radius of the top

61
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:54,840
left and bottom right corner and the

62
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:57,390
second one controls the radius of the

63
00:02:57,390 --> 00:02:59,370
top right and bottom left corner like

64
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:03,750
this you can have a third length that

65
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:07,080
controls the bottom right corner and if

66
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:11,460
you have four of them each controls its

67
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:16,290
own corner separately and they go in

68
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:18,240
clockwise order like everything in CSS

69
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,190
everything that accepts multiple lengths

70
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:22,080
in CSS goes in clockwise order not just

71
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:28,140
border-radius so to summarise when you

72
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:29,640
have two lengths they each correspond to

73
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:32,550
a different longhand property and why do

74
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:36,030
you need to use long hands they're quite

75
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:37,620
useful in case where you have something

76
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:44,250
like this so you only want to set one

77
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:48,900
corner to be different but using the

78
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:50,520
shorthand requires you to repeat the

79
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:53,730
value three times so it's much bird but

80
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:56,880
much better to use just this and use the

81
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:03,470
long hand like butter bottom left radius

82
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:08,310
zero so don't repeat yourself anything

83
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:09,990
you anything you code in CSS you'll

84
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:11,670
eventually have to change it at some

85
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:13,980
point so make it easier for your future

86
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:18,480
self so this summarizes how it works

87
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,760
when you have two values it corresponds

88
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:24,150
to two declarations if you have three

89
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:26,670
values the first one corresponds to just

90
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:29,010
one corner at the top left and the third

91
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:30,780
one as well and the second one

92
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:32,889
corresponds to two corners

93
00:04:32,889 --> 00:04:35,439
the bottom the top right and the bottom

94
00:04:35,439 --> 00:04:38,860
left and when you have four values each

95
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:42,219
one just sets one corner so I'm sure

96
00:04:42,219 --> 00:04:44,289
many of you have heard that you can set

97
00:04:44,289 --> 00:04:45,849
different values for a different

98
00:04:45,849 --> 00:04:47,709
coordinates before so this is where

99
00:04:47,709 --> 00:04:49,419
things started to get interesting

100
00:04:49,419 --> 00:04:51,429
here we have a typical water radius

101
00:04:51,429 --> 00:04:54,099
declaration for which sets the top-left

102
00:04:54,099 --> 00:04:56,469
corner at 900 pixels and all the other

103
00:04:56,469 --> 00:05:00,879
corners at 90 pixels it could be it

104
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:03,039
could look like this but for brevity is

105
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:07,719
it's like this so the dimensions of this

106
00:05:07,719 --> 00:05:12,069
box basically I can just spell them out

107
00:05:12,069 --> 00:05:13,209
and nothing will change

108
00:05:13,209 --> 00:05:18,610
I think the width is 400 and 540 pixels

109
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:25,300
and the height is 420 pixels so as you

110
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:27,639
might have noticed the 900 pixels does

111
00:05:27,639 --> 00:05:30,219
not fit so you end up with something

112
00:05:30,219 --> 00:05:32,829
really strange like when I increased the

113
00:05:32,829 --> 00:05:35,559
border it is here did you notice that

114
00:05:35,559 --> 00:05:40,599
every single radius changed and just

115
00:05:40,599 --> 00:05:42,519
changed into the top-left radius but

116
00:05:42,519 --> 00:05:45,009
they all change right at that why did

117
00:05:45,009 --> 00:05:48,099
does this happen and the reason is that

118
00:05:48,099 --> 00:05:50,469
since the border radius does not look

119
00:05:50,469 --> 00:05:52,539
that we specified does not fit like if

120
00:05:52,539 --> 00:05:54,699
the board if the browser tried to apply

121
00:05:54,699 --> 00:05:58,240
this border radius we've set like 900

122
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:02,529
pixels and 90 for the other corners so

123
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:06,579
we need it to have at least 900 990

124
00:06:06,579 --> 00:06:08,949
pixels on every dimension but we don't

125
00:06:08,949 --> 00:06:10,959
our width her height are not smaller

126
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:14,199
than 990 so the browser needs to scale

127
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:16,629
our border radius down and there are

128
00:06:16,629 --> 00:06:18,369
many possible ways the census working

129
00:06:18,369 --> 00:06:20,199
group could decide to go with this but

130
00:06:20,199 --> 00:06:24,369
they they decided that the browser will

131
00:06:24,369 --> 00:06:27,099
scale every radius on every corner by

132
00:06:27,099 --> 00:06:29,709
the same amount so that the proportions

133
00:06:29,709 --> 00:06:32,499
between the radiuses remain the same

134
00:06:32,499 --> 00:06:35,739
even though the actual radiuses changed

135
00:06:35,739 --> 00:06:39,249
so in this case we ended up having

136
00:06:39,249 --> 00:06:43,590
radius of 38 pixels on the top

137
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:46,260
right bottom left in the bottom corners

138
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:52,470
and a radius of 381 pixels on the

139
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:54,360
top-left corner which is not what we

140
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,490
specified but they have their same ratio

141
00:06:56,490 --> 00:06:58,680
between them the first one is 10 times

142
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:05,400
as much as the other ones so in the

143
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:08,340
wording of the spec when the sum of any

144
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:10,590
two adjacent border radii exceeds the

145
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:12,840
size of the border box us must

146
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,850
proportionally reduce the used values of

147
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:16,830
all border radii until none of them

148
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:18,510
overlap if it doesn't makes much sense

149
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:21,000
in that kind of wording just remember

150
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,070
when I said if it doesn't fit the

151
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:25,320
browser shrinks all the radii so that

152
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,000
they fit by the way both radio and

153
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,830
radiuses are correct so that's where the

154
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:35,190
grammar now Z is around here and if you

155
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:37,590
find mass easier to understand it looks

156
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:41,160
like this every every radius is either

157
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,080
the specified one or the width

158
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:48,000
multiplied by the ratio between the the

159
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,790
two radiuses on that side and by the way

160
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:53,280
I'm using my family for this equation

161
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,720
mathema was quite awesome where it's

162
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,250
supported and when it's not supported

163
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:58,440
you can just use the CSS fallback here

164
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,300
I'm using Firefox so it is supported so

165
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:04,200
it's just native math ml and as a recap

166
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,780
what we just learned or already knew

167
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:10,560
your mileage may vary so we can have

168
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,030
different radiuses per corner and

169
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:14,130
clockwise order separate properties for

170
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:16,080
every corner available like water top

171
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,210
right radius and if the sum of two

172
00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:21,390
adjacent radiuses or radii exceeds the

173
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:22,770
length of their side they're reduced

174
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:24,330
proportionately which is I think the

175
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:27,300
most important thing to remember from

176
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:31,350
this section this is a quite cool demo

177
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:33,900
that somebody made just using border

178
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:37,980
areas well in some JavaScript and just

179
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:39,660
using border radius and another like

180
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:41,360
super advanced way just using different

181
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,770
radii per corner and I think it looks

182
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:46,740
pretty cool like you can click the boxes

183
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:50,550
and make like infinite shapes and it

184
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:54,730
just adjusts and it uses CSS transitions

185
00:08:54,730 --> 00:09:03,189
no yeah well so it you can make infinite

186
00:09:03,189 --> 00:09:09,850
shapes with it so we've set out to

187
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:11,980
create an ellipse with what we've

188
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:14,740
already learned about water radius so

189
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:18,009
obviously when we have an ellipse every

190
00:09:18,009 --> 00:09:19,569
corner has the same radius so we don't

191
00:09:19,569 --> 00:09:23,709
need multiple lengths here so here we've

192
00:09:23,709 --> 00:09:26,709
specified 210 pixels it's half our

193
00:09:26,709 --> 00:09:29,230
height if we reduce it we see what

194
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:32,170
happens and if we increase it we can't

195
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:34,990
increase it above 210 because what we

196
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:39,040
said before so nothing we try seems to

197
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,079
create an ellipse and that's because we

198
00:09:41,079 --> 00:09:43,420
can't create an ellipse with what we've

199
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:44,920
already seen we need to use border

200
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:47,170
radius in different way so you can add a

201
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:50,470
slash and specify different horizontal

202
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:54,009
and vertical radius so here this is

203
00:09:54,009 --> 00:09:55,240
equivalent to what I've had before

204
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:58,389
because they're both equal let me show

205
00:09:58,389 --> 00:10:03,040
you and but now you can adjust either of

206
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:06,309
them separately and there you have it

207
00:10:06,309 --> 00:10:09,759
there's your ellipse or you can do like

208
00:10:09,759 --> 00:10:16,240
any number of different shapes but in

209
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,620
this case we wanted to make an ellipse

210
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:20,290
so let's go back to that the problem is

211
00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:22,899
this looks like an ellipse that's what I

212
00:10:22,899 --> 00:10:28,779
wanted but if I increase the width it

213
00:10:28,779 --> 00:10:30,879
doesn't look like an ellipse anymore

214
00:10:30,879 --> 00:10:34,569
does it it just looks ugly I'm not sure

215
00:10:34,569 --> 00:10:36,699
how that shape is called but it's not an

216
00:10:36,699 --> 00:10:43,839
ellipse yeah so do I have to go back to

217
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:45,399
border radius and change it every time

218
00:10:45,399 --> 00:10:50,139
my shape changes actually well that

219
00:10:50,139 --> 00:10:51,730
could be one solution but there's a

220
00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:56,439
better one so we can just specify it in

221
00:10:56,439 --> 00:11:00,579
percentages like 50% horizontally and

222
00:11:00,579 --> 00:11:02,949
50% vertically and since they're now

223
00:11:02,949 --> 00:11:06,640
equal the specified border radiuses

224
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:07,810
the same both horizontally and

225
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:09,190
vertically even though it doesn't

226
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:13,030
compute to the same radius we can even

227
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:14,590
remove the slash and just have word

228
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:17,320
rates 50% so now regardless of our

229
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:26,770
dimensions we have an ellipse so we've

230
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:28,720
seen how we can make an ellipse but can

231
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:32,230
we make like half an ellipse with

232
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:33,690
border-radius

233
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:37,390
we can use percentages and different

234
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:40,060
radius per corner to make half an

235
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:43,110
ellipse so what is half an ellipse

236
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:45,960
horizontally it has 50% radius and

237
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:48,190
vertically it has a hundred percent

238
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:50,290
because it's like the curve takes all

239
00:11:50,290 --> 00:11:53,680
its height it has 100% radius in the top

240
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:56,110
two corners and zero in the bottom

241
00:11:56,110 --> 00:12:03,520
corners so let's try this and now we

242
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:06,190
have half half an ellipse and if we make

243
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:10,840
the dimensions if we make the width half

244
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:16,200
of the height we can have a semicircle

245
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,790
okay now we've seen how we can have an

246
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:20,710
ellipse and half an ellipse but can we

247
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:24,730
have a quarter ellipse the quarter

248
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:26,740
ellipse is actually even easier than

249
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:30,100
this so obviously the width needs to be

250
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:32,140
equal to the height so let's try

251
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:37,780
something like maybe 400 and what is a

252
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:40,660
quarter ellipse the top left quarter is

253
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:43,600
100 percent both ways both horizontally

254
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,970
and vertically and all the other corners

255
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:51,510
are zero so it would look like this

256
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:54,940
that's a quarter of a circle and if we

257
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,890
change dimensions we just have a quarter

258
00:12:56,890 --> 00:12:59,440
ellipse and we can have lots of

259
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,230
interesting shapes with if we use

260
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:06,180
border-radius wisely so just to sum up

261
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:07,750
here's how it works

262
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:11,320
the number of values before and after

263
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:14,680
the slash can be different here it just

264
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:16,720
happens to be the same but here for

265
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,310
instance we have four values before the

266
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:20,090
slash and three values after the slash

267
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:21,770
they're expanded into the browser

268
00:13:21,770 --> 00:13:23,440
expands them into four values

269
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,910
independently select you can have one

270
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:27,800
value before and like for after it and

271
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:30,170
another thing to note is that when

272
00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:33,320
either of the two is zero both compute

273
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,600
to zero because you can't have something

274
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,390
with like a 50 pixels vertical radius

275
00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:40,490
and zero horizontal radius how would

276
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:42,260
that look so they they have to both

277
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:46,430
compute to zero so what we just learned

278
00:13:46,430 --> 00:13:48,260
we can have different horizontal and

279
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:50,810
vertical radii percentages and

280
00:13:50,810 --> 00:13:52,220
border-radius refer to the corresponding

281
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:55,010
dimension either width or height border

282
00:13:55,010 --> 00:13:56,570
readers can take up to eight lengths if

283
00:13:56,570 --> 00:13:59,000
you're crazy enough I've never needed to

284
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,460
use eight lengths I don't think but you

285
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:05,050
can and when either of the two radiuses

286
00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:09,140
is 0 both compute to 0 so here are a few

287
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:11,690
demos that demonstrate that this

288
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:13,430
complexity in border radius is not just

289
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:15,260
intellectual masturbation of the CSS

290
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:17,800
working group but it's actually useful

291
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:21,530
so Simar I was like really awesome with

292
00:14:21,530 --> 00:14:23,930
CSS made these buttons and he've used

293
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:25,460
like every single thing I've mentioned

294
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:27,410
so far to make them and I think they

295
00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:29,810
look so cool like look at this shape or

296
00:14:29,810 --> 00:14:32,960
this he's used he used elliptical radii

297
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:35,060
in different once per corner to make the

298
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:39,170
illusion of depth and the 3d effect is

299
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:42,590
just box shadow so you should go there

300
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:43,870
and have a look I think they're awesome

301
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:46,700
this is less practical than the buttons

302
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:49,550
but I think it's quite fun it shows like

303
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:51,710
all these shapes are just border-radius

304
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:54,740
and here's a little example of mine I've

305
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:58,300
used percentages and border-radius here

306
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:01,760
for the languages whoops yeah that won't

307
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:02,240
work

308
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:07,760
sorry Firefox okay yeah I think that's a

309
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,320
hundred percent so I've used them here

310
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:11,300
for the languages and here for the

311
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:14,000
button and the whole thing is just CSS

312
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,280
there's just a background texture for

313
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:18,440
the pebbles and all the shapes and

314
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:23,150
everything is just CSS so how many of

315
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:29,030
you ever wondered why is Bohr radius

316
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:31,310
called water radius why isn't it called

317
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:33,410
corner radius like all the examples I've

318
00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:33,649
shown

319
00:15:33,649 --> 00:15:37,249
you before just use they don't use any

320
00:15:37,249 --> 00:15:41,300
borders so why is it cold like that why

321
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:43,930
did we name it border-radius

322
00:15:43,930 --> 00:15:46,579
this has anyone how many of you have

323
00:15:46,579 --> 00:15:50,689
wondered about this at some point okay

324
00:15:50,689 --> 00:15:54,769
maybe I'm weird uh well I used to often

325
00:15:54,769 --> 00:15:56,720
wonder about this like corner idiot

326
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,240
sounds like a much better name it was

327
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,439
called border-radius

328
00:16:00,439 --> 00:16:04,939
because it rounds the border box which

329
00:16:04,939 --> 00:16:07,699
is the same there's no difference if you

330
00:16:07,699 --> 00:16:10,480
don't have any borders but in this case

331
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:13,009
the forty percent the forty pixels

332
00:16:13,009 --> 00:16:16,189
refers to the outer radius the inner

333
00:16:16,189 --> 00:16:23,609
radius is smaller oh not this again

334
00:16:23,619 --> 00:16:29,930
yes zooming

335
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:32,400
so here we just saw that if you've

336
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,560
zoomed in Firefox the computed values

337
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,050
are that it reports a difference that's

338
00:16:37,050 --> 00:16:39,930
why I can't like 21-point something now

339
00:16:39,930 --> 00:16:43,200
I assume doubt and it's correct so the

340
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:46,890
inner radius is 80 pixel is 20 pixels if

341
00:16:46,890 --> 00:16:48,960
I increase the border the inner radius

342
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:52,080
becomes smaller and well obviously it

343
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,970
can't get smaller than zero but you

344
00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:57,140
might end up not having a radius at all

345
00:16:57,140 --> 00:17:01,920
if your border is too large and the the

346
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,560
inner radius is actually the specified

347
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:06,540
border radius minus the width of the

348
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:09,840
border and if you have different border

349
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:12,570
widths in every side that still applies

350
00:17:12,570 --> 00:17:13,980
and you might have different horizontal

351
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:16,050
and vertical radius on the inner side as

352
00:17:16,050 --> 00:17:18,290
you'll see in a few minutes

353
00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:21,330
so in the wording of the spec the

354
00:17:21,330 --> 00:17:22,950
padding edge in their border radius is

355
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:24,810
the outer border radius minus the

356
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:26,730
corresponding border thickness in the

357
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:28,260
case where this results in a negative

358
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:31,380
value inner radius is zero which is what

359
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:34,710
I just showed you if you prefer maths it

360
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:37,320
kind of looks like this the inner radius

361
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:40,350
is the maximum of zero because it can't

362
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:44,010
be negative or the outer radius minus

363
00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:48,180
the borders the border width and this is

364
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:49,380
how it looks when you have different

365
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:54,000
order widths per side so if you notice

366
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,680
here I've specified a regular border

367
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:59,100
radius just to the part of a circle you

368
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:01,680
can see that it works fine for the outer

369
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:04,170
edge but the inner edge is an ellipse

370
00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:05,910
it's part of an ellipse it's an

371
00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:09,540
elliptical curve so and there's the same

372
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:12,780
thing here the outer radius is 40 which

373
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:16,370
is part of the circle but the inner one

374
00:18:16,370 --> 00:18:20,600
sorry but the inner one is an ellipse

375
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:23,100
which is something we may or may not

376
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:26,160
like so assuming we like it everything

377
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,320
is great but if we don't like it and we

378
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,390
want to change it so that the inner

379
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:33,660
radius is part of a circle we don't care

380
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:35,430
about the outer radius but we want this

381
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:36,750
one not to be elliptical

382
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:38,940
we don't like this we want this to be a

383
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:42,860
circle so how do we go about it

384
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:47,340
we can just override border top right

385
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:53,010
radius and increase the horizontal

386
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:56,730
radius so that it balances the border of

387
00:18:56,730 --> 00:19:00,750
widths we have so we can specify 50

388
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:03,179
pixels horizontally and 40 pixels

389
00:19:03,179 --> 00:19:04,040
vertically

390
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:06,240
note that when you're using the long

391
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,919
hands to specify different horizontal

392
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:09,600
and vertical radius you don't need the

393
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,510
slash there are so many cases where I've

394
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:14,160
used the slash and I was wondering why

395
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,230
is my CSS not applied this is not

396
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:21,090
correct this is so now we have a regular

397
00:19:21,090 --> 00:19:23,030
curve on the inner of our box and

398
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:27,210
obviously the outer the outer radius is

399
00:19:27,210 --> 00:19:31,410
elliptical so in some cases we might

400
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:35,520
prefer how this looks or maybe not but

401
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:38,740
now you know how to do it

402
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:42,990
so what happens when you have different

403
00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:46,590
border colors beside so here we've got

404
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:50,940
we have this border color but let's

405
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:53,910
assume we want to enlist to create the

406
00:19:53,910 --> 00:19:56,640
illusion over harder shadow so we

407
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:01,530
specify black on this side as you can

408
00:20:01,530 --> 00:20:05,880
see there's a hard transition between

409
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:08,640
the two colors and it's only affected by

410
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:12,750
the the difference between border widths

411
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:15,150
the ratio of the different border widths

412
00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:17,460
it's not affected by the border radius

413
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:21,450
at all we can change it and the angle

414
00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:24,150
remains the same the same as when we

415
00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:26,460
don't have any border radius I recall

416
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:28,020
there were so many discussions in the

417
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:30,690
CSS working group about what this angle

418
00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:34,559
should be took a long time to decide on

419
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:38,669
something so this might be inconvenient

420
00:20:38,669 --> 00:20:40,380
for cases where we're trying to emulate

421
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:42,990
this kind of 3d effect but it can

422
00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:46,679
actually be quite useful for some other

423
00:20:46,679 --> 00:20:50,850
cases like if we reduce the dimensions

424
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:52,000
here

425
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,600
you might see where this is going and we

426
00:20:55,600 --> 00:21:01,180
specify one single border width so and

427
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:04,630
we can change this to any colors of our

428
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:08,770
liking like I don't know this or green

429
00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:12,100
and red and whatever I've actually used

430
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:17,140
this before to emulate a Wi-Fi signal

431
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:18,940
with like one of those and

432
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:22,060
pseudo-element inside so I think it's

433
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:24,760
fun so I wanted to show it you may or

434
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:27,280
may not agree about its usefulness or

435
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:30,220
practicality but you can't disagree it's

436
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:35,050
fun so what we just learned

437
00:21:35,050 --> 00:21:37,270
border-radius rounds the outer border

438
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:39,790
edge the inner border radius will be

439
00:21:39,790 --> 00:21:44,350
smaller or zero even with a circular

440
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:46,900
radius inner one might be elliptical if

441
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:50,110
different widths are involved and if the

442
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:51,730
borders have different colors the

443
00:21:51,730 --> 00:21:53,560
transition will be abrupt and diagonal

444
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:58,270
the angle thing I've showed you so

445
00:21:58,270 --> 00:22:01,180
border borders are the border properties

446
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:03,670
do follow border-radius do all CSS

447
00:22:03,670 --> 00:22:06,310
properties follow border radius let's

448
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:09,190
take a look at box shadow your note you

449
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:12,880
can notice here that water box shadow is

450
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:16,360
also rounded and it has the exact same

451
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:20,250
rounding as our border radius we can

452
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:23,320
tweak its rounding if we change the

453
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:25,810
spread radius like if we make it bigger

454
00:22:25,810 --> 00:22:29,110
by 10 pixels it's rounding will also be

455
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:32,650
bigger and as we increase the spread its

456
00:22:32,650 --> 00:22:34,300
rounding increases as well because

457
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:35,470
that's what looks more natural and

458
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:38,500
obviously we can also do the opposite if

459
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:41,650
we if we specify a negative spread

460
00:22:41,650 --> 00:22:45,130
radius its rounding will decrease so

461
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:47,710
book shadow does follow border radius

462
00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:53,160
but other properties don't like outline

463
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:56,740
you can try all you want but the outline

464
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:58,960
will not follow your rounding regardless

465
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,510
of what rounding you have or what

466
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:03,070
outline you have it just won't be

467
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:04,060
rounded

468
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:06,490
in Firefox you can round it with this

469
00:23:06,490 --> 00:23:09,510
horrible proprietary protocol most

470
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:14,080
outline radius and let's specify

471
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:17,050
something like I know 40 pixels it

472
00:23:17,050 --> 00:23:18,520
doesn't even follow the border radius

473
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:20,290
you have to specify it you have to

474
00:23:20,290 --> 00:23:22,780
specify it separately and only it only

475
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:25,180
works in Firefox and it's pretty

476
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:27,160
horrible so is there something better

477
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:30,220
than we can do remember what we've

478
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:33,850
showed before about box shadow we don't

479
00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:35,950
need those stinky outlines we can

480
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:38,100
emulate that effect with box shadow if

481
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:41,290
we just specify box shadow with no blur

482
00:23:41,290 --> 00:23:44,440
and no offsets and just a positive

483
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:46,990
spread radius we can have the same thing

484
00:23:46,990 --> 00:23:49,180
and it just naturally follows our border

485
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:53,290
radius quite nicely so we don't need

486
00:23:53,290 --> 00:23:56,080
those outlines and it even behaves the

487
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:59,080
same it doesn't affect layout just like

488
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:02,020
outlines which is what if we could use a

489
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:03,790
border but border is affect layout and

490
00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:06,550
we might not want this so what we just

491
00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:09,070
learned box shadow follows the curves of

492
00:24:09,070 --> 00:24:11,830
border radius and spread adds to the

493
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:13,680
border radius or negative spread

494
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:16,030
subtracts from border radius which is

495
00:24:16,030 --> 00:24:18,400
basically the same thing outline is

496
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,290
always rectangular it doesn't follow it

497
00:24:20,290 --> 00:24:23,440
but we can emulate an outline with box

498
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:27,070
shadow so here's another thing that most

499
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:29,350
of you already know but some of you

500
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:32,080
might not have thought about since water

501
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:34,210
radius accepts length values its

502
00:24:34,210 --> 00:24:37,030
animatable so we can make pretty cool

503
00:24:37,030 --> 00:24:40,720
animations with it like here we go from

504
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:44,830
a smaller radius to a bigger one and we

505
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:50,380
can do things like this which is kind of

506
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:54,730
like it's dancing or we can do things

507
00:24:54,730 --> 00:25:01,810
like let's try something like this like

508
00:25:01,810 --> 00:25:06,650
a semicircle of sorts

509
00:25:06,650 --> 00:25:09,830
which kind of looks like it's jumping

510
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:12,210
you can make many cool things if you

511
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:14,100
think of anything else that's quite cool

512
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:15,690
you can submit it here it's a gallery of

513
00:25:15,690 --> 00:25:17,940
animations and it only has two about

514
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:19,710
border-radius right now everybody just

515
00:25:19,710 --> 00:25:22,560
submits transforms I am so sick of

516
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:24,630
seeing animations with transforms I mean

517
00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:26,480
they're cool don't get me wrong but

518
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:30,170
let's explore some other possibilities

519
00:25:30,170 --> 00:25:33,240
so what we just learned what a radius is

520
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,610
animatable we can animate between any

521
00:25:35,610 --> 00:25:40,950
two radiuses percentages and viewport

522
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:44,240
relative units to pixels whatever and

523
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:46,200
border-radius effects they hit the

524
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:52,920
testing area so here I should specify

525
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,960
overflow:hidden because otherwise I have

526
00:25:54,960 --> 00:26:00,660
an inner object so you can see that if I

527
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:03,920
hover here the effect is not triggered I

528
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:06,300
have to actually hover on the area on

529
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:09,420
that area on the rounded area that's

530
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:11,340
white border radius was a huge

531
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:14,040
revolution from the background image

532
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,750
solutions where we're using not just

533
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:18,170
because it was easier but also because

534
00:26:18,170 --> 00:26:21,420
unlike other solutions it effects a hit

535
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:26,600
testing area so here's another caveat

536
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:28,910
border-radius is all fine and

537
00:26:28,910 --> 00:26:32,130
interoperable if you're using it in CSS

538
00:26:32,130 --> 00:26:35,790
but what if you're using scripting is it

539
00:26:35,790 --> 00:26:38,790
interoperable interoperable there so

540
00:26:38,790 --> 00:26:40,350
here we have a border radius that has

541
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:42,240
like pretty much almost everything I've

542
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,880
told you so far it has percentages it

543
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:48,360
has different units different values per

544
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:50,820
corner curves that don't fit on their

545
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:53,100
scale down so what happens if you're

546
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:55,350
trying to get the computed style so

547
00:26:55,350 --> 00:26:57,360
let's suppose we're getting that element

548
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:00,570
and we're calling it computed style on

549
00:27:00,570 --> 00:27:02,610
it and we're querying border top left

550
00:27:02,610 --> 00:27:06,060
right us most browsers return a hundred

551
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:08,030
percent which is what we specified

552
00:27:08,030 --> 00:27:11,550
Firefox is being smarter and it resolves

553
00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:13,920
it a hundred percent of pixels and it

554
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:16,650
also scales it down to what was actually

555
00:27:16,650 --> 00:27:19,930
applied because here we don't have a

556
00:27:19,930 --> 00:27:24,550
that's hundred percent we have 360

557
00:27:24,550 --> 00:27:28,840
pixels in two hundred and eighty and if

558
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:30,840
we try to get the top right radius

559
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:34,840
similarly all browsers return eighty

560
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:40,480
pixels which is the m's we have

561
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,610
converted to pixels so they at least

562
00:27:42,610 --> 00:27:45,970
bother to do that but they don't do

563
00:27:45,970 --> 00:27:49,360
anything else Firefox is smarter it

564
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:52,660
returns the actual used value which is

565
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:53,890
really convenient that's why I'm using

566
00:27:53,890 --> 00:27:56,110
Firefox for this presentation otherwise

567
00:27:56,110 --> 00:27:57,520
I wouldn't be able to do this school

568
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:00,190
showing the curve thing I don't you use

569
00:28:00,190 --> 00:28:02,860
Firefox on rate on a daily basis but

570
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:08,740
it's really useful for this talk so what

571
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:09,460
we just learned

572
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:12,400
there are incompatibilities in scripting

573
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,710
in border-radius Firefox converts

574
00:28:14,710 --> 00:28:16,870
percentages to pixels all other browsers

575
00:28:16,870 --> 00:28:19,300
report percentages and when the radius

576
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:20,200
doesn't fit

577
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:22,720
Firefox report scaled down sizes all

578
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:27,190
other browsers report specified sizes so

579
00:28:27,190 --> 00:28:33,580
I have five more minutes okay so some of

580
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:36,760
you are I'm sure many of you are quite

581
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:38,590
advanced and he knew everything in this

582
00:28:38,590 --> 00:28:42,010
talk so this is my secret weapon this

583
00:28:42,010 --> 00:28:45,820
section have we seen everything about

584
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:50,290
water radius so far are there any

585
00:28:50,290 --> 00:28:53,800
changes coming so in CSS backgrounds and

586
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,720
borders four of which I'm an editor

587
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:58,630
there's a really cool property I didn't

588
00:28:58,630 --> 00:29:00,940
come up with it Ellicott Ahmad did but

589
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:03,640
it's an amazing property which is called

590
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:06,250
border corner shape so border color

591
00:29:06,250 --> 00:29:08,860
shape will get keywords and currently

592
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:10,630
gets one keyword but in the future it

593
00:29:10,630 --> 00:29:13,240
will get will change the spec and it

594
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:14,920
will accept different keywords per

595
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:18,340
corner so if you have curve you get the

596
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:19,960
default effect that we've seen in this

597
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:22,420
talk a curve just gives you curved

598
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:26,440
corners you can have bevel that just

599
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:28,130
cuts corner at

600
00:29:28,130 --> 00:29:30,419
that creates this sort of effect and

601
00:29:30,419 --> 00:29:32,190
it's not just useful for this effect

602
00:29:32,190 --> 00:29:35,880
only you can have a number of cool you

603
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:37,590
can do a number of cool things with it

604
00:29:37,590 --> 00:29:46,440
like you can do polygons of sorts you

605
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:52,340
can do diamonds you can do triangles

606
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:55,500
let's see it would be 50% horizontally

607
00:29:55,500 --> 00:30:03,240
and 100% see hexagons triangles we're

608
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:05,039
going to huge lengths today to make

609
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:11,639
triangles it should be simpler or you

610
00:30:11,639 --> 00:30:18,630
can do like arrow shapes like this this

611
00:30:18,630 --> 00:30:20,549
is simulated with SVG by the way that's

612
00:30:20,549 --> 00:30:22,289
born according to shape is not supported

613
00:30:22,289 --> 00:30:29,880
anywhere yet so you could do like this

614
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:32,250
bread crumb kind of shape with it as

615
00:30:32,250 --> 00:30:36,620
well and there's also a scoop value

616
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:38,940
which creates this effect which some

617
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:43,429
people call negative border-radius and

618
00:30:43,429 --> 00:30:45,889
you can have a notch value which is

619
00:30:45,889 --> 00:30:48,269
arguably less useful than the other ones

620
00:30:48,269 --> 00:30:50,700
just creates this effect but you can use

621
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:57,059
it to make crosses and stuff so but

622
00:30:57,059 --> 00:30:58,470
according to Sabre is really cool but

623
00:30:58,470 --> 00:31:00,120
even if it gets implemented it will but

624
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:02,820
it will be a while before it does is

625
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:05,340
tomato will be at least a year before we

626
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:07,260
get the first implementations and that's

627
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:09,899
if those who don't want it in the spec

628
00:31:09,899 --> 00:31:12,919
don't win so what can we do until then

629
00:31:12,919 --> 00:31:16,049
and we start using background images for

630
00:31:16,049 --> 00:31:18,929
those effects there is another way we

631
00:31:18,929 --> 00:31:22,500
can use gradients and that way we can

632
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:25,679
tweak them from the CSS like now I'm

633
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:27,389
just changing the size of one of the

634
00:31:27,389 --> 00:31:29,639
corners and here we have four linear

635
00:31:29,639 --> 00:31:31,799
gradients and each occupy a quarter of

636
00:31:31,799 --> 00:31:33,779
our element that's why background size

637
00:31:33,779 --> 00:31:36,740
is 50% you can see it more clearly if I

638
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:40,289
change this like every one of those

639
00:31:40,289 --> 00:31:41,340
gradients of

640
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:47,670
you PI's 1/4 here and you can do

641
00:31:47,670 --> 00:31:49,860
something similar with radial gradients

642
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:52,650
as well and you can still tweak them

643
00:31:52,650 --> 00:31:56,370
quite easily although in some browsers

644
00:31:56,370 --> 00:31:59,520
they're they're a bit Elias they're not

645
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:03,440
the smoothest background images

646
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:07,260
so as I'm mirroring to an end in this

647
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:08,970
talk you might feel like you've

648
00:32:08,970 --> 00:32:10,050
forgotten many things especially

649
00:32:10,050 --> 00:32:11,820
everything especially if you've learned

650
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:13,380
something new today which I really hope

651
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:17,610
you did so what can you do if you feel

652
00:32:17,610 --> 00:32:19,560
you're forgotten anything first off my

653
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:21,840
slides are online so if you've kept

654
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:26,880
notes that wasn't good idea all right

655
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,460
you can use these resources to remind

656
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:32,610
yourself well first to our web are from

657
00:32:32,610 --> 00:32:34,320
webplatform.org how many of you have

658
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:38,420
heard about web platforms org yay

659
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:42,420
they're getting more so webplatform.org

660
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:46,350
is an effort by w3c and several other

661
00:32:46,350 --> 00:32:49,650
companies like Adobe and Microsoft and

662
00:32:49,650 --> 00:32:51,570
Google and opera Mozilla and like all

663
00:32:51,570 --> 00:32:54,000
the big players of the web to create a

664
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,100
single documentation resource with the

665
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:58,320
community because it's it's a wiki so if

666
00:32:58,320 --> 00:32:59,850
you find something wrong instead of

667
00:32:59,850 --> 00:33:02,730
complaining you can fix it and it's

668
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:04,470
vendor-neutral it's not conceited it's

669
00:33:04,470 --> 00:33:06,030
not controlled by a single vendor like

670
00:33:06,030 --> 00:33:08,900
all the other resources we've had so far

671
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:11,910
so I think it's quite amazing I have a

672
00:33:11,910 --> 00:33:13,860
few stickers with me if you know if

673
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:15,210
you'd like one just find me afterwards

674
00:33:15,210 --> 00:33:17,360
and this is the link to the

675
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:19,710
specification I didn't include the link

676
00:33:19,710 --> 00:33:21,270
to the CSS backgrounds and borders for

677
00:33:21,270 --> 00:33:22,980
specification because that's still in

678
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:24,990
edit or draft and I kind of felt guilty

679
00:33:24,990 --> 00:33:28,530
doing so but if you can find it quite

680
00:33:28,530 --> 00:33:31,200
easily because you know editor drafts

681
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,610
are not normative or anything there

682
00:33:32,610 --> 00:33:34,170
aren't specifications are basically just

683
00:33:34,170 --> 00:33:41,010
ideas oh one minute over time so before

684
00:33:41,010 --> 00:33:42,900
I finish and before I go into the Q&A

685
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:44,850
section that we probably don't have time

686
00:33:44,850 --> 00:33:47,160
for it for here is the question I

687
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:50,310
usually get after my talks how was how

688
00:33:50,310 --> 00:33:51,720
did you make this was was the web

689
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:53,090
application yes it's a web application

690
00:33:53,090 --> 00:33:54,169
the

691
00:33:54,169 --> 00:33:55,730
our slide deck was built with open web

692
00:33:55,730 --> 00:33:58,070
technologies the slideshow framework is

693
00:33:58,070 --> 00:33:59,509
something I've released like two years

694
00:33:59,509 --> 00:34:01,039
ago but I keep adding to it it's called

695
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:03,499
CSS as the illustrations are built with

696
00:34:03,499 --> 00:34:06,440
SVG mr. bharat radiuses face as animated

697
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:10,190
with smile and the equations displayed

698
00:34:10,190 --> 00:34:13,280
will were built with math amel like I've

699
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:17,720
already mentioned so thank you very much

700
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:19,790
this is how you can contact me and this
