00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:13,440

my name is Sebastian Deutsch and yeah hi

2
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,360
I'm Stefan I'm we're both working

3
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:19,580
foreign elements so today we're going to

4
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:22,350
think a little bit about animations in

5
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:24,990
the web browser so and how we can

6
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:29,460
achieve them we have several emerging

7
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:30,869
technologies as you heard in the talk

8
00:00:30,869 --> 00:00:35,340
before in the new AP ice JavaScript API

9
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:37,230
s you get what you can do is like you

10
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:39,600
can use canvas to draw things you can

11
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,969
have scalable vector graphics for vector

12
00:00:41,969 --> 00:00:45,360
animations and you can use the new css3

13
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,500
transitions to to do like Dom element

14
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:52,289
movements there are other low-level

15
00:00:52,289 --> 00:00:55,350
techniques like WebGL or 3d which we

16
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:57,210
don't cover in this talk but they do

17
00:00:57,210 --> 00:00:59,550
exist and if you have questions feel

18
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:03,270
free to ask them after the talk the

19
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:05,549
company we're working that elements got

20
00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:09,000
quite popular when we released an HTML

21
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,750
canvas demo like two years ago and it's

22
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:14,580
funny because like we're a software

23
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:16,530
company which has a strong focus on

24
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:18,210
design but we are software company it's

25
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:21,150
like suddenly all people news for like

26
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:23,340
are you the company with the dots we

27
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:25,290
said yeah we're doing sovereigns like no

28
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:26,549
you'd accompany with Dawson now we

29
00:01:26,549 --> 00:01:28,200
accept this life yes with the company

30
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,119
with it with dots and we've connection

31
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:33,119
of 5 yeah and that's cool please let's

32
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:48,330
open the demo no less knowledge

33
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:58,600
praying to the Wi-Fi got internets well

34
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:02,960
sure and we can skip it let's just go on

35
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:08,119
with okay can you close it yeah maybe it

36
00:02:08,119 --> 00:02:13,370
starts yeah so let me just do a quick

37
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:16,730
recap of canvas I think some of you have

38
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:21,200
work you have done some camera stuff so

39
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,420
who submitted something to json' k to

40
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:28,130
the competition only one of you guys so

41
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:30,190
I mean basically that's just basic stuff

42
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:33,380
you have like a Dom element a canvas tag

43
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:37,190
in your HTML and then in the JavaScript

44
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:39,200
so that's actually coffeescript because

45
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,660
it looks way nicer and slides it just

46
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:44,239
get the element and get the 2d drawing

47
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:46,190
context out of that and then you can go

48
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:49,069
any just go apeshit you can do like you

49
00:02:49,069 --> 00:02:52,910
can draw rectangles arbitrary paths you

50
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:55,100
can draw quadratic curves and stuff like

51
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:57,769
that I mean you can you can go

52
00:02:57,769 --> 00:03:01,880
everything with canvas so let's do

53
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,530
animations with canvas how does it work

54
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:06,769
so animations in canvas at first it's a

55
00:03:06,769 --> 00:03:10,790
little bit I don't know I was I was kind

56
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:12,079
of surprised so you have to do

57
00:03:12,079 --> 00:03:14,150
everything manually you have like one

58
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:16,760
big draw loop in which you clear the

59
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:19,100
canvas like you fill it with the

60
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:21,200
background color which actually is a

61
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,810
very computing extensive operation

62
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:25,820
because you have to fill so many pixels

63
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:29,109
at least on most neck browsers I think

64
00:03:29,109 --> 00:03:32,120
then you calculate positions of your

65
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:36,890
objects and you can wait so it's not

66
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:39,049
working may just take this demo that

67
00:03:39,049 --> 00:03:41,239
should be should be fun I asked where

68
00:03:41,239 --> 00:03:43,910
there's another canvas demo which is

69
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:52,960
offline as well on conferences

70
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:55,680
no actually it's nothing is working

71
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,640
since which one are we using chip work

72
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:10,730
oh it's our learnings like we open it

73
00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:13,200
let's try this again and then we just

74
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,989
continue with it which the slides are

75
00:04:14,989 --> 00:04:21,260
not working unless it was the evil cable

76
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:24,479
so so what we what we doing here it's

77
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:38,090
like we when we going into the demo

78
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:42,490
we're going to obtain the canvas here as

79
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:49,450
depicted here and oh yeah sure let me do

80
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:54,190
that and there it is and increase the

81
00:04:54,190 --> 00:05:02,290
size a little bit right

82
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:06,979
you read it okay can you really okay so

83
00:05:06,979 --> 00:05:08,509
what we're going to do is like we get

84
00:05:08,509 --> 00:05:10,520
the canvas then we get a context which

85
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:14,180
is actually the the the instrument the

86
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:16,810
API where we can like draws the things

87
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:19,460
then we're going to define interval

88
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:23,319
handler where we like call a function

89
00:05:23,319 --> 00:05:30,199
every every 30 / no times per second

90
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:33,560
yeah 70 sounds a second and we're going

91
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:37,310
to clear the canvas with with a fixed

92
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:39,860
width and the fixed wide and then we're

93
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:41,810
going to set the context like we have

94
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:43,400
like some particles we define some

95
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:46,009
objects and we fill them with a

96
00:05:46,009 --> 00:05:48,349
particular color and then we're going to

97
00:05:48,349 --> 00:05:50,930
draw a circle this is the arc function

98
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:53,060
canvas doesn't have a native circle

99
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:54,349
function so we're going to draw it and

100
00:05:54,349 --> 00:05:57,469
it looks like this and we added some

101
00:05:57,469 --> 00:05:59,960
movement so if you click your mouse then

102
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,909
they're going to move move there and all

103
00:06:01,909 --> 00:06:04,129
that computation where you want to move

104
00:06:04,129 --> 00:06:05,930
them what do you want to do you have to

105
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:09,590
do it manually you have to compute it by

106
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:17,770
yourself yeah so basically um I just

107
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:22,190
shortcut through the because I wanted to

108
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:25,250
show you I think now that the internet

109
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:26,599
is working it would be pretty rare to

110
00:06:26,599 --> 00:06:29,719
show you the initial demo how about this

111
00:06:29,719 --> 00:06:32,210
off I all session click the Sun City far

112
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:39,490
away

113
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:42,340
we had that one

114
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:44,120
you

115
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:47,810
there it is

116
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:50,530
so actually that was our first

117
00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:54,250
experience with canvas you know it's

118
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:59,680
like getting data from Twitter like

119
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,560
tweets containing the word html5 then we

120
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,020
kind of visualize those on the black

121
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:08,140
background and do these random kind of

122
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:11,260
movements and actually that was that

123
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:13,480
became quite popular which kind of made

124
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,920
us go further than to that direction

125
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,900
because it's quite a lot of fun to do

126
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:22,150
animations using that stuff so let's go

127
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:26,890
back to the presentation so did like

128
00:07:26,890 --> 00:07:28,420
there's another important thing if you

129
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:31,900
if you do like drawing on the on the web

130
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:35,770
so what about interaction so you cannot

131
00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:39,130
like bind click handlers to elements in

132
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:41,530
the canvas because there are no Dom

133
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:43,120
elements in a canvas you are drawing

134
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,160
everything manually so what you actually

135
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:47,860
have to do is you get the XY position

136
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:50,130
from click events and then you have to

137
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:53,500
calculate kind of which element has been

138
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:57,340
clicked by yourself so that's that's

139
00:07:57,340 --> 00:07:59,350
kind of tedious sometimes but if you do

140
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:01,240
it right it should work just as well and

141
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:03,310
actually there are libraries which

142
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:06,070
simplify that task so if you want to go

143
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:08,260
into canvas I recommend checking those

144
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:13,180
two out so the cool thing about canvas

145
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:15,340
is it's very flexible you have you can

146
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:18,850
do pixel level manipulations and it's

147
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:21,850
very fast for some some things and if

148
00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:23,950
you if you draw something later on you

149
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:26,260
can just export it to an image and store

150
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:29,560
it and it also got some drawbacks

151
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,720
actually is resolution dependent because

152
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:34,030
you're always pushing pixel values so

153
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:35,919
unless you're using a framework where

154
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:39,940
you kind of have a way to multiply well

155
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:42,820
use into a bigger or smaller space you

156
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:44,920
are going you might have a problem but

157
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,360
actually if you scale up a canvass you

158
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:49,660
get this nice pixel retro effect and I

159
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:53,620
think yeah we have some some demos that

160
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:56,880
you already seen we have another one

161
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:00,450
Roger click here which we implemented

162
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:02,940
for a client who who has to visualize

163
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:04,860
communication between computer knots and

164
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:07,860
we were like thinking in the first place

165
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:10,170
if we do in with canvas or if we do it

166
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:12,900
with SVG and the task for the client was

167
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:15,210
like to create an visualization which

168
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:18,900
can handle up to 5000 notes and with SVG

169
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:22,020
it will be pretty pretty slow so we've

170
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:24,870
chosen canvas which is slow as well but

171
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:27,150
it's acceptable and we created that map

172
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:29,700
where you can can zoom in zoom out and

173
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:32,370
you can see if a node is online offline

174
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:36,140
you can click and as Jeff unset like

175
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:38,610
it's very most very tedious work to

176
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:40,910
create all the event listeners

177
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:44,160
introduced manually I mean basically if

178
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,200
you so what you're what you've just seen

179
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,790
is like hover effect so you have to

180
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:50,340
recalculate whether your mouse position

181
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:52,530
is on top of some object in your canvas

182
00:09:52,530 --> 00:09:54,480
and when you click you have to do the

183
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:57,300
same thing okay this is another demo you

184
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:01,080
just you can draw shapes with canvas

185
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:03,360
like rectangles or circles but you can

186
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,750
do draw images or whatever bitmaps as

187
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:10,440
well and we created some some nice

188
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,630
control which is not like when you see

189
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:14,580
it you see okay this is flash but it's

190
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:17,000
more flashes canvas and you can click

191
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,680
images as well and you can highlight

192
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,450
similar results and they're going to be

193
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:23,730
focused and all those computations are

194
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:26,970
done manually this is downside but i

195
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:29,280
think the performances is pretty good

196
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,290
it's pretty comparable what you what you

197
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:37,080
can do with flash right now okay let's

198
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:40,620
come to the to the second technique to

199
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:43,140
two graphics which is a scalable vector

200
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:46,320
graphics test as we also mentioned is

201
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,110
the problem is that canvases resolution

202
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:51,060
dependent so if you take your browser

203
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:53,280
and you're going to zoom in the images

204
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:57,900
get very blurry so with SVG you don't

205
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:04,560
have that problem you have that and if

206
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,230
you if you're going to zoom in there it

207
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:09,360
doesn't get blurry at all because it's

208
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:14,850
vectors and so how do you do it SVG is

209
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:19,320
an xml substandard and it's a language

210
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:22,470
to define two-dimensional graphics take

211
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:25,950
it in a declarative way you can do as

212
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:29,070
well filters animations or even sounds

213
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:32,160
and one of the cool things is that is

214
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:35,850
its dom based so this is an example how

215
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:40,769
to draw a circle on a surface you see

216
00:11:40,769 --> 00:11:43,440
the xml element for a circle the SVG

217
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,350
container and you see some attributes

218
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:50,220
like CX CY for Santa extent of Y R

219
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:51,899
stands for radios you have a fill color

220
00:11:51,899 --> 00:11:54,899
and a stroke are you familiar what's

221
00:11:54,899 --> 00:11:59,640
with Phil and strokes what it is ok this

222
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:02,820
is a more complex example where we're

223
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:06,149
going to define a gradient in in the SVG

224
00:12:06,149 --> 00:12:08,220
definitions and then we're going to draw

225
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:12,029
an ellipse and animate the attributes in

226
00:12:12,029 --> 00:12:14,670
it you can define the attribute the

227
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:18,149
animations natively with it but it's

228
00:12:18,149 --> 00:12:20,190
rather complicated to do with Aneesa Mel

229
00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:22,050
it's not it doesn't feel very yeah I

230
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:23,910
think it's tedious it's like you want to

231
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:25,890
say too and you say one plus one minus

232
00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:27,839
one plus one minus one plus one to get

233
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:30,600
to two it's like very much noise very

234
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:33,810
little information so yeah you know I

235
00:12:33,810 --> 00:12:36,149
think you know that yeah this is the

236
00:12:36,149 --> 00:12:39,690
report from the nokogiri documentation

237
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:41,880
which is an XML parser it says like XML

238
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,829
is like violence but if it does not

239
00:12:43,829 --> 00:12:45,300
solve your problems you don't use enough

240
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:50,339
of it luckily there's a very very nice

241
00:12:50,339 --> 00:12:52,050
javascript library which is called

242
00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:55,529
rafael des and this is the point where

243
00:12:55,529 --> 00:12:59,130
javascript comes in it abstracts the

244
00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:01,920
whole XML to nice JavaScript functions

245
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,589
where you just say circle or rectangle

246
00:13:04,589 --> 00:13:07,380
and you can put as many objects as you

247
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:11,670
want on a on a paper which is equivalent

248
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:15,420
the SVG equivalent to canvas and it has

249
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:17,819
also some very cool animation functions

250
00:13:17,819 --> 00:13:21,149
and it has also a vmail for fall back

251
00:13:21,149 --> 00:13:22,200
for the internets

252
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:26,040
and it really works in the in the really

253
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:29,860
filthy process if you know what I mean

254
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:32,910
interaction with SVG is pretty easy you

255
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:34,410
can use the browser's native

256
00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:39,210
capabilities because XML SVG is XML and

257
00:13:39,210 --> 00:13:41,400
it it lifts in the dome you're going to

258
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:44,520
add an ID to your to your XML elements

259
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,320
and you say get element by ID and your

260
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,840
add an event listener for click for

261
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,820
mouse over or whatever and you have

262
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:54,840
basic interaction this is pretty easy so

263
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:57,930
the pros for refugee is that is reducing

264
00:13:57,930 --> 00:14:00,600
resolution independent event handling is

265
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:03,690
a piece of cake and since it 6 ml you

266
00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:06,120
can also spice it with Aria attributes

267
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:11,070
to medic made it accessible but you

268
00:14:11,070 --> 00:14:13,440
can't do any pixel manipulation with

269
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,930
this a few if you want to display many

270
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:17,790
objects many pixels or you want to

271
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:19,830
transform something from color image to

272
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:22,640
grayscale image then SVG is not for you

273
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:25,380
usually it's slower than canvas canvas

274
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:28,440
this really depends them on the on the

275
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:31,590
browser implementation and it definitely

276
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:34,290
needs Rafael for if you like want to

277
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:40,050
support all all browsers we use it in a

278
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:43,230
client's work where the the goal has to

279
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:45,900
be to create something which which works

280
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:52,170
in most browsers and almost this stuff

281
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:54,690
you can see here the pie chart is done

282
00:14:54,690 --> 00:14:57,620
you can like create some shares and you

283
00:14:57,620 --> 00:15:00,180
can have some funding round for your

284
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:04,050
startup and sit in Rafael yeah actually

285
00:15:04,050 --> 00:15:06,720
it's done with Raphael a giraffe I'll

286
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,150
ride yes it's a plugin on top of rough

287
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:12,870
l0l where we have like very nice

288
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:15,060
interactions and even this little icons

289
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:16,830
here are done with with rivera as well

290
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:20,840
so they scale very nice it's pretty cool

291
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:27,180
so

292
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:30,560
so another example we really like those

293
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:33,650
dots and yeah it's your company with the

294
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:36,200
dots over yeah lighting the way we

295
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:43,300
decided to stick with that so yeah so I

296
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:46,580
think the what kind of emerged is the

297
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:49,010
most awesome way to do animations in the

298
00:15:49,010 --> 00:15:55,550
last year or so is css3 so I don't know

299
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:57,350
if you know this side I mean it has

300
00:15:57,350 --> 00:16:01,750
nothing to do with animations but I

301
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:05,150
think that's a lot of box shadow you see

302
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:10,040
a glow so those rays are glowing so if

303
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:12,410
you if you're trying to do animations on

304
00:16:12,410 --> 00:16:14,930
this thing so here basically those are

305
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:18,440
all lives those are all lives with box

306
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,330
shadow and they are rapke transformed

307
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:23,720
into place so if you animate them no

308
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,940
matter the browser it doesn't work

309
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:28,460
because it's so much not hardware

310
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:30,800
accelerated filter stuff going on

311
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,470
there's no way you can get above 1 FPS

312
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:40,070
or something so yeah so we implemented

313
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:43,850
the same thing again and actually it

314
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:48,050
runs not that fast in chrome because

315
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:49,850
chrome is not hardware accelerated but

316
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:52,220
if you run it in safari on iphone the

317
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:54,260
ipad you can run it and so far here but

318
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:56,990
we go no yeah maybe this is what we're

319
00:16:56,990 --> 00:16:58,430
going to show you on the iPads like we

320
00:16:58,430 --> 00:17:00,230
implemented the whole three dot thing

321
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:01,580
you're going to release it after the

322
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:04,339
talk on github so you can see the source

323
00:17:04,339 --> 00:17:06,500
code for yourself and we implemented the

324
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,150
first thing in canvas which is pretty

325
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:11,179
slow on the iPad it works but it's it

326
00:17:11,179 --> 00:17:14,420
looks it does not look so nice we have a

327
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:18,079
SVG version which is slight far sir but

328
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:21,819
not that fast as well and we have a

329
00:17:21,819 --> 00:17:24,439
hidden champion at that point it's like

330
00:17:24,439 --> 00:17:27,290
a version with CSS transitions and these

331
00:17:27,290 --> 00:17:29,690
are almost like run at full frame rate

332
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:33,080
so it's very very interesting things to

333
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:36,200
use to use and abuse CSS transitions to

334
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,680
create animations

335
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:42,160
so quickly pick a quick recap again so

336
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,650
how do you do effects how can you move

337
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:48,220
elements and transformed and oh actually

338
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:49,570
that is the process a WebKit transform

339
00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:52,840
sorry so and the second thing how do you

340
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:54,700
and how do you do animations well you

341
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:56,260
use the transition or the animation

342
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:59,830
attributes so just a very quick recap

343
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:02,530
you have like these four parameter value

344
00:18:02,530 --> 00:18:04,510
to set where you say which value you

345
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:09,520
want to animate for how long given a

346
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:12,400
timing function so there's an extra

347
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,860
slide for that in a second and you can

348
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:16,810
like set an initial delay so if you want

349
00:18:16,810 --> 00:18:18,970
to delay it transition or an animation

350
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:26,380
you can do that so timing yeah we dig a

351
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:28,060
little into into some timing functions

352
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:31,090
if you do animations you can do you have

353
00:18:31,090 --> 00:18:33,490
several possibilities possibilities to

354
00:18:33,490 --> 00:18:37,000
add a tyrant function its linear is is

355
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,820
in is out is an out and cubic z function

356
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:43,270
and we try to explain it visionless like

357
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:46,450
move the object from a to be at the in

358
00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:48,640
the same same time with the same

359
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:52,390
velocity easing means start with the

360
00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:57,340
higher velocity and and then do

361
00:18:57,340 --> 00:19:01,030
celebrate decelerate in the end even is

362
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:03,190
it decelerates in the beginning and then

363
00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:06,430
gets faster is out is the same like ease

364
00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:09,070
ease it out is like having balls

365
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:10,960
deceleration in the beginning in the end

366
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,870
and cubic busy is the possibility to add

367
00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:16,540
your own spline function to have like

368
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:18,520
like a bounce or something you can

369
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:20,920
create very interesting stuff with this

370
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:31,050
one yeah so basically you have for for

371
00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:33,430
transform up operations you can push

372
00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:36,040
into most browsers so you can translate

373
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:38,320
stuff which means moving it you can

374
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:41,650
scale it you can rotate it and there's

375
00:19:41,650 --> 00:19:44,170
this nice metrics attribute where you

376
00:19:44,170 --> 00:19:46,570
can basically you can feed it your own

377
00:19:46,570 --> 00:19:49,240
metrics which might be pre-calculated

378
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,000
which my

379
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,130
come from a native iphone clients so

380
00:19:52,130 --> 00:19:56,840
diamond mo coming up so and what makes

381
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:59,150
so css3 animations super useful well we

382
00:19:59,150 --> 00:20:02,210
already said it so the problem with

383
00:20:02,210 --> 00:20:04,280
canvas and SVG is it's not hardware

384
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:07,280
accelerated in most devices I think by

385
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,500
now I 9 is the only browser accelerating

386
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:13,700
canvas it's a true know which one it was

387
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:20,670
well Mozilla yeah for that's awesome so

388
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:25,400
well and of course interaction is also

389
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,650
native because you just animate Dom

390
00:20:27,650 --> 00:20:34,370
elements and old story so okay on iOS it

391
00:20:34,370 --> 00:20:37,910
is super powers but on androids little

392
00:20:37,910 --> 00:20:40,460
sets like all the nice transitions you

393
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:43,100
do on iphone which one like at full

394
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:46,010
frame rate they look they don't run a

395
00:20:46,010 --> 00:20:48,310
full frame rate on Android sadly and

396
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:51,110
unknown WebKit it looks more like this

397
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:55,720
yeah luckily Firefox 4 implements

398
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:58,400
transitions funny thing if you do a

399
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:02,830
translation of an object and Firefox for

400
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:07,100
its slower to do it with with with the

401
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:09,950
transform properties with the matrix and

402
00:21:09,950 --> 00:21:12,470
transitions rather than set your own set

403
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:14,960
interval and use margin-top and margin

404
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:18,350
left but they implemented it and they're

405
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:20,180
going to improve it and one day it's

406
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:21,590
going to be fast enough to do everything

407
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:26,120
you want to do with this okay so I'll

408
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:30,700
basically put to wrap it up a little and

409
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:33,080
you have to decide which one you're

410
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:34,700
going to use to solve your problem and

411
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:38,270
there is no best solution but here's

412
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:41,600
some advice so you kind of know when you

413
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:42,560
have to solve your problem you think

414
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:45,110
about okay does it run on mobile does it

415
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:51,260
run on on the desktop so that's a white

416
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:52,610
rule of thumb if you go mobile you

417
00:21:52,610 --> 00:21:55,100
should go for css3 transitions and stuff

418
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:56,390
like that because that works really

419
00:21:56,390 --> 00:21:59,780
really well you also have like when an

420
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:00,669
animation or if

421
00:22:00,669 --> 00:22:04,119
addition is finished you get WebKit you

422
00:22:04,119 --> 00:22:06,190
get Tommy whence being fired so you can

423
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:08,679
change or gather animations it's a bit

424
00:22:08,679 --> 00:22:10,389
limited at the moment but it's working

425
00:22:10,389 --> 00:22:18,369
quite alright and yeah so yeah so first

426
00:22:18,369 --> 00:22:19,929
you look at the device and then you look

427
00:22:19,929 --> 00:22:21,759
at the problem you're trying to solve so

428
00:22:21,759 --> 00:22:24,039
you've seen the network map if you have

429
00:22:24,039 --> 00:22:26,649
like a huge can with canvas with many

430
00:22:26,649 --> 00:22:27,970
notes you shouldn't put that into the

431
00:22:27,970 --> 00:22:32,619
dorm you just draw it so if you wanted

432
00:22:32,619 --> 00:22:34,509
to run in all browsers in the most

433
00:22:34,509 --> 00:22:36,940
process possible you use SVG but you

434
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:38,590
have to keep an eye on performance if

435
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:42,850
you want your super mobile solution then

436
00:22:42,850 --> 00:22:44,769
go with CSS transitions if you if you

437
00:22:44,769 --> 00:22:46,450
know that your target audience is going

438
00:22:46,450 --> 00:22:49,090
to be iphone users iPad users then go

439
00:22:49,090 --> 00:22:52,779
with CSS transitions so I'm trying to

440
00:22:52,779 --> 00:22:57,100
access the last demo on the iPad so this

441
00:22:57,100 --> 00:23:06,399
is I'm going to access it here oh by the

442
00:23:06,399 --> 00:23:08,499
way that's a that's a cool canvas game i

443
00:23:08,499 --> 00:23:13,690
think is it cameras yeah it's canvas the

444
00:23:13,690 --> 00:23:16,840
game was just a created out of curiosity

445
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:20,889
what you can do with canvas and it also

446
00:23:20,889 --> 00:23:23,679
has sound yellow we're running away from

447
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:29,320
ie6 trying to eat us yeah it is never we

448
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:31,149
have just one level finished because we

449
00:23:31,149 --> 00:23:34,450
had no time if we first iteration was

450
00:23:34,450 --> 00:23:36,549
like man that's so awesome like now make

451
00:23:36,549 --> 00:23:39,129
it super super awesome and then we know

452
00:23:39,129 --> 00:23:41,190
you know how project goes sometimes you

453
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:44,409
have client work to do and so that was

454
00:23:44,409 --> 00:23:46,659
before I 9 we wouldn't have done that

455
00:23:46,659 --> 00:23:55,480
now so yeah okay all right thank you

456
00:23:55,480 --> 00:24:01,979
very much

457
00:24:01,989 --> 00:24:13,579
any questions no yet is it not yet the

458
00:24:13,579 --> 00:24:15,649
source for the game this game was

459
00:24:15,649 --> 00:24:18,649
created by some interns at night

460
00:24:18,649 --> 00:24:20,989
elements so the source is pretty

461
00:24:20,989 --> 00:24:24,769
undocumented pretty buggy and we always

462
00:24:24,769 --> 00:24:26,389
wanted to clean it up and then release

463
00:24:26,389 --> 00:24:28,899
it but we we do not have time until like

464
00:24:28,899 --> 00:24:32,869
mid-2011 and maybe we're going to

465
00:24:32,869 --> 00:24:34,399
release it for the sake of it and then

466
00:24:34,399 --> 00:24:41,749
fuck it and clean it up yeah okay all

467
00:24:41,749 --> 00:24:47,179
right thanks objective-c client running

468
00:24:47,179 --> 00:24:49,219
on here capturing the gyroscope theta

469
00:24:49,219 --> 00:24:52,009
and it's connecting to a node which is

470
00:24:52,009 --> 00:24:54,049
running on some server in Germany I

471
00:24:54,049 --> 00:24:58,549
don't know where and so the the web

472
00:24:58,549 --> 00:25:00,950
client is connecting to the note why a

473
00:25:00,950 --> 00:25:03,169
WebSocket and if i turn my iphone like

474
00:25:03,169 --> 00:25:08,059
that I get like yeah it's like yeah it's

475
00:25:08,059 --> 00:25:10,519
pretty rad it's not normalized so if I

476
00:25:10,519 --> 00:25:12,200
hold it like this it's it's fucked up

477
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:14,719
but I could like subtract the rotation

478
00:25:14,719 --> 00:25:16,729
value from some initial starting point

479
00:25:16,729 --> 00:25:20,959
and you could also hook up WebGL to that

480
00:25:20,959 --> 00:25:24,589
so this could be like a virtual kind of

481
00:25:24,589 --> 00:25:27,200
object you could turn and look at which

482
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,059
wich might be very interesting so it's a

483
00:25:29,059 --> 00:25:31,339
little bit going into the I went to
