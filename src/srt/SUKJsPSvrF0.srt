1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,240

oh my name is Franco I'm from England

2
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,089
and I'm a junior JavaScript developer so

3
00:00:15,089 --> 00:00:17,730
I'm kind of new to this well to trying

4
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:20,039
to prove myself in this world with all

5
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:24,269
you pros out there yeah so remember that

6
00:00:24,269 --> 00:00:26,609
junior bit because in my story which I'm

7
00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:30,000
going to tell you that's important yeah

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,870
so recently I made a web based like app

9
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:36,930
for the company I work for and it's

10
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:39,239
basically like very simple actually but

11
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:41,340
it looks quite simple it's basically a

12
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:45,960
quiz and the customer people just use

13
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:47,629
like they go and they use the quiz

14
00:00:47,629 --> 00:00:51,090
answer the questions and depending on on

15
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:54,570
their preferences in the in the quiz we

16
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:56,190
give them like a tailored Pinterest

17
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:57,570
board for them to upload to their

18
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:00,600
Pinterest account so yeah that's kind of

19
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,760
cool and I'd you know I tested

20
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:04,920
everything and made sure it worked

21
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,720
you know I tested it again made sure it

22
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:11,010
worked so yeah drop all done right then

23
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:13,590
they put it live and they started

24
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:16,229
promoting it and I started promoting at

25
00:01:16,229 --> 00:01:18,720
Facebook and it stopped working

26
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,990
and obviously I'm like wow I really

27
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:24,299
thought I checked everything I really

28
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:25,890
thought was working and suddenly

29
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:27,150
everyone's time you know we're losing

30
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:31,920
money you're costing us money so I have

31
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,430
to find out why it turns out so they

32
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:37,200
were promoting on Facebook and what was

33
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,229
happening was the customers were users

34
00:01:40,229 --> 00:01:45,149
would find find this promotion on

35
00:01:45,149 --> 00:01:46,770
Facebook but that'd be using their

36
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:48,329
phones that be using it inside the

37
00:01:48,329 --> 00:01:51,049
Facebook app so be clicking on this link

38
00:01:51,049 --> 00:01:53,880
which would open up inside of the

39
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,250
Facebook app so how many of you just out

40
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,649
of interest know who heard of in app

41
00:01:58,649 --> 00:02:03,540
browsers all of you okay how many of you

42
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:06,259
had problems working with them okay so

43
00:02:06,259 --> 00:02:10,470
so maybe it's fairly common then yeah so

44
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:11,819
it wasn't working on basically what was

45
00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:14,010
happening I looked into it

46
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:16,560
the user the customer of user know what

47
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,780
the correct term is would use the quiz

48
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:20,760
and then it would get to the end of the

49
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,709
quiz and then we just reset it would go

50
00:02:22,709 --> 00:02:24,840
to the start it like like the pager to

51
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:28,110
refresh and obviously I have to try and

52
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:29,340
debug this but how am I going to bug

53
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:30,959
this in you know browser you know

54
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:32,910
there's no console.log there's no like

55
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:34,950
tools and stuff that you can just pop

56
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:38,530
open like with Chrome or Firefox

57
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:40,200
probably running out of time there but

58
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:45,780
yeah so basically I had to do some kind

59
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:47,459
of like reverse engineering I had to

60
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:50,310
actually test everything inside Facebook

61
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:55,739
and I couldn't use console.log so I was

62
00:02:55,739 --> 00:02:57,569
try this website on the Internet which

63
00:02:57,569 --> 00:03:00,000
kind of gives you a console so I was

64
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,790
able to use that to test I found out

65
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:04,140
that basically this in-app browser

66
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:08,819
wasn't storing cookies so Pinterest was

67
00:03:08,819 --> 00:03:11,670
sending back this a war key through a

68
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:13,319
cookie and obviously that wasn't working

69
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:15,209
because it wasn't wasn't saving anyway

70
00:03:15,209 --> 00:03:17,160
but what it was doing was it was sending

71
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:20,910
a new URL to the user with the OAuth ID

72
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:24,329
in the URL so hence the page refresh so

73
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:26,400
obviously I had to like figure out state

74
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,780
obviously I'd need to save state now

75
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:28,920
something I didn't have to think about

76
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:32,190
before so I had to start checking can I

77
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:34,829
use local storage yes luckily I was able

78
00:03:34,829 --> 00:03:37,049
to use local storage so save the data in

79
00:03:37,049 --> 00:03:39,209
local storage it was bit kind of hacky

80
00:03:39,209 --> 00:03:41,730
basically when the user goes to the site

81
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:43,049
I have to check if they've been there

82
00:03:43,049 --> 00:03:44,940
before and if there's any data in local

83
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:48,120
storage and then reload the quiz with

84
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,530
you know the answers are already

85
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:52,440
prefilled so that was working got it

86
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:55,700
yeah but real pain in the ass because

87
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:58,500
every time I was testing something I had

88
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:02,609
to clear the cache inside Facebook in

89
00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:05,760
that browser but you can't just very

90
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,819
easily clear the cache there is actually

91
00:04:07,819 --> 00:04:10,769
if you go to the settings there is a

92
00:04:10,769 --> 00:04:12,720
button like delete all data but it

93
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,310
doesn't delete all data because it was

94
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:15,959
still showing me information which you

95
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:18,599
know old information so every time I

96
00:04:18,599 --> 00:04:20,370
wanted to test something I had to delete

97
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:24,000
the app and reinstall it so and out took

98
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,430
bloody ages as well it's like and every

99
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:27,450
time I did that

100
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:30,440
I kept getting reminded how like

101
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:33,450
Facebook app has like three out of five

102
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:34,650
styles or something or two and a half

103
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:37,860
stars out of five on it on the App Store

104
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:42,210
so probably good reason to that yeah so

105
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:44,760
what did I learn I learned that

106
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:47,310
communication so if if I had

107
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:49,980
communicated with the marketing team

108
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:51,510
I would have known that the problems

109
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:53,700
would have all the testing that we

110
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:54,930
should have been doing would have been

111
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:58,200
focused more inside Facebook app and not

112
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,330
outside and web-based stuff where I

113
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:03,450
could test freely in Chrome and Firefox

114
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:05,880
with all the tools dev tools available

115
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:10,920
to me yeah just in time

116
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:13,410
[Applause]
