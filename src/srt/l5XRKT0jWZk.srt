1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:02,580

thank you very much and sorry about that

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:04,680
setup I have like the least technical

3
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:06,450
presentation today so of course I had

4
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:08,280
the most technical problems getting my

5
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:10,800
computer working so you know I tried to

6
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,719
make it nice and easy but you just you

7
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:14,639
know technology I love it and I also

8
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:18,060
hate it so yeah so alright I have this

9
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:18,539
thing

10
00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:21,619
it makes the slides go big secret so

11
00:00:21,619 --> 00:00:24,660
yeah so my name is Laker and I'm gonna

12
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:26,279
be talking to you about some of the work

13
00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:28,289
that I do with young developers on our

14
00:00:28,289 --> 00:00:30,599
platform but really I think that it

15
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:33,300
extends to all development and really to

16
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:34,800
pretty much almost any industry if you

17
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,820
really really think about it

18
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:39,989
my magical button things don't work and

19
00:00:39,989 --> 00:00:42,300
so I'll just be over here and so just to

20
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:43,680
give you kind of a little roadmap of

21
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,149
what we're gonna do today I'm just gonna

22
00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:47,280
give you a little bit of a who is this

23
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:47,730
guy

24
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:49,500
gonna talk about some of our developers

25
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,239
talk about some of our experiences

26
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:53,730
working with them and then last I'm

27
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:55,050
gonna wrap it up and kind of talk about

28
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:56,610
you know maybe what you can do with your

29
00:00:56,610 --> 00:00:59,300
community and some people that you know

30
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:02,340
so to start off my name is Laker

31
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:04,619
I am always hesitant to give out my

32
00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:07,200
title as we saw the manager of

33
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,909
information experience no one knows that

34
00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:11,670
what that means that's okay my title

35
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:13,530
changes all the time basically the gist

36
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:15,450
of it is that I teach kids how to make

37
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:17,460
games that's really the long and short

38
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:19,259
of it I started as a full-stack engineer

39
00:01:19,259 --> 00:01:21,060
but then realized you know I'd rather

40
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:23,189
teach people how to code than to do it

41
00:01:23,189 --> 00:01:25,350
myself all the time love coding but only

42
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:27,450
in small pieces or rather teach people

43
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:30,360
how to do it and the company I work for

44
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:31,590
is called roblox

45
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:33,329
maybe you've heard of it maybe you

46
00:01:33,329 --> 00:01:36,329
haven't the trick is if you have someone

47
00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:38,340
young in your life like a nephew niece

48
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:40,650
son daughter chances are they might have

49
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:42,869
heard of this yeah we're a gaming

50
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:45,299
platform it's primarily aimed at kids

51
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:46,740
although we like to think that we're for

52
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:49,439
all ages and the beauty of our platform

53
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:52,110
is that we try to take all the heavy

54
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:55,590
work out of doing making games I'm not

55
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:57,180
sure how familiar all of you are with

56
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:58,950
game development there's a lot of things

57
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:00,299
are just a real pain in the butt

58
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:04,110
things like networking physics you know

59
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:06,060
just managing servers so much of that

60
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:08,610
just gets in the way of starting up a

61
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:10,289
new game starting up a new project and

62
00:02:10,289 --> 00:02:11,849
we just realized you know what why don't

63
00:02:11,849 --> 00:02:13,160
we just do

64
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,720
all that work for people so that they

65
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,420
can just focus on the gameplay focus on

66
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:19,580
the experience and what's really nice

67
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:21,290
about that is that because we take all

68
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:22,640
those little technical aspects that you

69
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,080
usually need lots years and years of

70
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,750
experience doing we've just cut all that

71
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:28,610
out and it leaves a really nice simple

72
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:30,470
shell that people can work with and it

73
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:32,480
really aligns nicely with kids because

74
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,010
they don't have to do all these fancy

75
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:35,600
things they can just hit the ground

76
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:38,510
running within like five minutes if you

77
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:39,710
want to see this in action we actually

78
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:40,880
have a workshop tomorrow where we're

79
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,050
going to literally do that with kids

80
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:43,790
they'll just have games up and running

81
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:47,630
really quick and technically full

82
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:49,820
disclosure we aren't actually JavaScript

83
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:51,470
so I appreciate you all welcomed me

84
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:55,100
welcoming me to your tier community we

85
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:57,400
do do Lua which is also scripting but

86
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:00,020
not quite the same it has its own fun

87
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:01,970
little quirks anyway

88
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:02,990
I didn't really want to talk too much

89
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:04,490
about robots specifically I did want to

90
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:07,370
talk about our developers because

91
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:10,250
they're a pretty unique Bunch they're

92
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:12,200
like a lot of people you probably know

93
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,910
they're very passionate very talented

94
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:16,660
very driven but they're also very young

95
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:18,890
because we're a platform that's

96
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:20,720
primarily aimed at kids are the games on

97
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,240
our platforms are played by kids you

98
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:26,510
know 9 10 11 and they suddenly get this

99
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:29,870
kind of realization moment usually when

100
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:30,920
they're kind of like in middle school

101
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:31,760
there get a little more tech-savvy

102
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,560
they're playing all these games on the

103
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:36,590
platform they realize oh these games

104
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:39,230
were also made by kids maybe I could do

105
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:42,650
that too and so they often start off

106
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:44,330
being like okay well let's just dive

107
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:45,739
into this and again we try to make it

108
00:03:45,739 --> 00:03:47,030
very simple for people to get started

109
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:48,590
you don't have to learn you don't have

110
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:50,810
to learn about you know a big fancy game

111
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:52,370
engine you can just get a project going

112
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:54,290
on day one and so they'll just

113
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:56,360
experiment they'll just try things a lot

114
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,010
of these kids are self-motivated

115
00:03:58,010 --> 00:04:00,410
self-learn they try to just recreate

116
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:02,150
games that they see or just recreate

117
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:03,950
little mechanics or they'll

118
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:06,860
reverse-engineer you know it's something

119
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:09,140
that they've seen and so they're a very

120
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:10,940
interesting bunch and I really like

121
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:13,340
working with them for lots of reasons

122
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:15,230
and that's mainly what I'm going to talk

123
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:19,520
about throughout this talk and I want to

124
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:20,510
start off by just giving you a little

125
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:21,979
case study just to kind of paint you a

126
00:04:21,979 --> 00:04:23,310
picture of

127
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:25,200
kind of one of our one of our typical

128
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:29,340
users so this is Brandon LaRouche he

129
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:31,620
started very young with roblox I think

130
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:34,290
he was probably about like 10 or 11 he

131
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:35,880
played with his brother his twin brother

132
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,680
actually it's weird I knew a lot of

133
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,590
twins on roblox it's weirdest thing and

134
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:42,270
they all come in pairs like they don't

135
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:43,470
do it individually they all do it

136
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:46,770
together yeah he started with his

137
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:48,510
brother and again it's this classic

138
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:50,190
story that I told you he just started

139
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:51,690
kind of playing games and then he

140
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:53,100
realized oh there's these really easy

141
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:55,680
development tools I guess I could

142
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,390
probably do that he didn't start off

143
00:04:57,390 --> 00:04:59,130
fancy he didn't try to make Skyrim or

144
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:01,230
anything like that he just you know made

145
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:03,660
little little platformer games or just

146
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:06,300
made little tiny game mechanics again

147
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:07,620
just try to recreate little things of

148
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:10,530
what he saw and from that he actually

149
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:13,560
realized like oh I really like software

150
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:16,740
development I really like coding and it

151
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:18,210
really could just jump started his

152
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:20,520
career again I want to emphasize very

153
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:25,020
very early so he took that and he went

154
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:27,060
beyond roblox although he's come back to

155
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:30,030
roblox since but he explored all kinds

156
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:31,350
of software development because of this

157
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:34,410
initial spark he explored baking mobile

158
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:37,830
apps he explored making websites he even

159
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:41,640
wrote books and again I want to I can't

160
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,830
emphasize this enough young he wrote two

161
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:47,160
books by the time he was fifteen I don't

162
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,840
know what I was doing when I was fifteen

163
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,160
I don't know what you were doing is when

164
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,229
you were fifteen I'm gonna guess that

165
00:05:52,229 --> 00:05:53,850
you weren't writing books and this guy

166
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:56,789
published - which just blows my mind

167
00:05:56,789 --> 00:05:59,789
it's it's amazing and also like his apps

168
00:05:59,789 --> 00:06:01,430
like he's made apps that have like

169
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:05,160
650,000 downloads like again that's not

170
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:08,550
something I did when I was 1516 but

171
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:13,500
there he is and yeah and really what's

172
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,960
kind of neat about Brandon is that I was

173
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,250
fortunate enough to work with him he

174
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:18,630
actually came for an internship at our

175
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:20,729
company and then we liked him so much

176
00:06:20,729 --> 00:06:23,100
that we just hired him pretty much on

177
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:24,390
the spot I mean we have to wait for him

178
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:27,000
to finish school but he's so talented

179
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,740
from again just kind of jump-starting

180
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:30,600
really really early he didn't wait to

181
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,030
finish high school or college to you

182
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:35,520
know develop his skills we're you know

183
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,870
when he's joining a company he's not

184
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:37,080
going

185
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:39,000
a junior level because he's basically

186
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,830
the technical lead on our development

187
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:42,419
website he started that up and he's an

188
00:06:42,419 --> 00:06:43,979
intern and we contracted him after it's

189
00:06:43,979 --> 00:06:47,099
soft and so amazingly talented person

190
00:06:47,099 --> 00:06:50,159
and what's really cool about what I'm

191
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:51,509
talking about today is that there are

192
00:06:51,509 --> 00:06:53,129
lots of brandon's out in the world just

193
00:06:53,129 --> 00:06:54,840
kind of wanted to paint you a picture of

194
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,550
one of them there lots of them that we

195
00:06:56,550 --> 00:07:01,020
work with and so to kind of segue from

196
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:02,430
that I want to talk about some of the

197
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:05,099
programs that we do and again this is

198
00:07:05,099 --> 00:07:07,620
sort of gives the context of how we work

199
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:09,690
with these developers so we have two

200
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:12,629
programs that we run on-site in our

201
00:07:12,629 --> 00:07:15,060
offices down in San Mateo by the way yes

202
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:16,469
I'm from California and I'm really glad

203
00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:18,780
that it's not smoky up here so really

204
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:22,229
refreshing change yeah so we run two

205
00:07:22,229 --> 00:07:24,419
programs in our offices and they're both

206
00:07:24,419 --> 00:07:26,219
essentially mentorship programs we have

207
00:07:26,219 --> 00:07:27,449
what are called our incubators and

208
00:07:27,449 --> 00:07:29,340
accelerators difference isn't too

209
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:31,770
important basically we bring these kids

210
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:35,279
on-site to give us some direct platform

211
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:37,560
feedback because their domain experts on

212
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,969
our platform so we want to make sure

213
00:07:38,969 --> 00:07:40,349
they can talk with engineers and say hey

214
00:07:40,349 --> 00:07:41,879
you know it'd be nice if we could fix

215
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:43,250
this would be nice we had this feature

216
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:46,289
but the other really big part of these

217
00:07:46,289 --> 00:07:49,020
programs and whoa Kisan here is that we

218
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:50,569
give them mentorship and guidance

219
00:07:50,569 --> 00:07:52,740
because really the theme of what i want

220
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:53,969
to talk about today is that there's lots

221
00:07:53,969 --> 00:07:55,650
of these young developers out there who

222
00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:58,680
are really gifted and talented but

223
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,389
they're lacking in some just kind of

224
00:08:00,389 --> 00:08:03,120
real world expertise a lot of them again

225
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,310
our self-taught self-motivated you know

226
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:07,529
they you know watch videos on YouTube

227
00:08:07,529 --> 00:08:09,240
they read tutorials they just kind of

228
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,639
try things out a lot of times they'll

229
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:13,020
come to us as sort of lone wolves

230
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:14,969
they're like yeah I've dabbled with

231
00:08:14,969 --> 00:08:16,740
everything I've learned a lot but then

232
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:18,750
they don't really know how to take that

233
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:19,949
to the next level they don't know how to

234
00:08:19,949 --> 00:08:22,080
achieve like their vision of creating a

235
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,180
game or making an app in our case is

236
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:26,599
pretty much exclusively games but again

237
00:08:26,599 --> 00:08:29,569
it this applies to pretty much anything

238
00:08:29,569 --> 00:08:32,550
and so yeah when they come to us we

239
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:34,740
really just kind of kickstart them

240
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:37,199
through development of their games you

241
00:08:37,199 --> 00:08:38,699
know we sit them down they make sure

242
00:08:38,699 --> 00:08:40,440
that they have a plan make sure that

243
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,360
they assemble teams make sure that

244
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,800
they're prototyping again just all these

245
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:46,589
things that maybe not may not be super

246
00:08:46,589 --> 00:08:48,060
obvious to a developer

247
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:49,740
who's just starting out but something

248
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:51,930
that we as industry experts can kind of

249
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:54,750
impart upon them and it's kind of kind

250
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:55,950
of shows you some of the things that

251
00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:56,820
came out of this

252
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:58,470
there's just three titles that happen in

253
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:01,620
we are a platform and just to give you

254
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:03,600
some context across these three titles

255
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,610
there's more than two billion game plays

256
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:09,120
across all three of them it's just again

257
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,400
just blows my mind the success of some

258
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,290
of these young devs have these are all

259
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:15,680
people like half my age and it's just

260
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:19,350
it's I don't know I just get flex I

261
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:20,490
can't talk about them because they're

262
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:24,870
just so amazing so yeah again so we work

263
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:27,660
with these kids on site and so now I'll

264
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:28,740
just talk about you know some of the

265
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:30,180
learnings that we have and like how we

266
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:32,100
how we work with them and how we guide

267
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:34,500
them in how we mentor them and again

268
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,390
giving the context that they're all

269
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:39,870
really really young so kind of one of

270
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:41,490
the first lessons we learned very early

271
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:45,420
on was not trying to tell them what to

272
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:47,760
do in terms of like make this game

273
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,740
implement this thing do it this way use

274
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:52,830
this tech we definitely tried that early

275
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:54,660
on we were like hey you know let's let's

276
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:56,100
try to have you make this game we had a

277
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:58,500
very heavy-handed approach in all

278
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,720
aspects of their development from the

279
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,980
design to the implementation and you

280
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:07,470
know we we we met a lot of resistance I

281
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:09,420
think that if you if they even work with

282
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:11,430
kids or work with almost anyone really

283
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:13,050
no one really likes to be forced to do

284
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:15,270
what to do we don't want to be told what

285
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:17,220
to do they don't to be forced rather

286
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:20,430
they you want to be guiding people and

287
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:22,170
so that's kind of what we shifted

288
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:24,350
towards was instead of telling them hey

289
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:26,820
here's the games that you should make we

290
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:28,620
instead try to just inspire and guide

291
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:31,500
them one of the classic stories I like

292
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:34,020
to actually tell about this in terms of

293
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:35,670
not forcing is that one of our early

294
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:39,360
early folks in fact the person who made

295
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,209
that game on the far left in each city

296
00:10:41,209 --> 00:10:44,670
he came in he pitched a game to us he's

297
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:45,779
like oh we're gonna make this game

298
00:10:45,779 --> 00:10:47,670
you're gonna just socialize or hang out

299
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:48,930
with your friends there might be some

300
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:50,250
mini games it might make a house but

301
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:51,209
really it's just kind of this social

302
00:10:51,209 --> 00:10:54,120
hangout thing and a whole bunch of

303
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:57,270
veteran gaming people looked at him or

304
00:10:57,270 --> 00:10:58,920
just like that

305
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:01,620
never going to work do something else

306
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:02,220
make this other

307
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:06,120
game he did it it was okay and then he

308
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,460
came back and made me city and again

309
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:10,260
this is the game that we said hey don't

310
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:11,970
you know this game probably is not gonna

311
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:14,490
work but then it did it's super super

312
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:15,990
popular as one of our top games of the

313
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:17,520
platform and it has been for like over a

314
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:20,190
year so again kind of lesson we got from

315
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:23,850
that was you know the people that were

316
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:25,260
working with these young developers they

317
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:26,910
have a dream they have a vision and they

318
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:29,130
also really understand these new

319
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:32,340
audiences as well and so really what

320
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:34,770
we're looking to do with them is again

321
00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:36,420
not tell them what to do but just help

322
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:40,620
them reach their goals so in terms of

323
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:43,200
inspiring you know really what we do is

324
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,970
we try to help them refine their ideas

325
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:47,100
so kind of the example I like to use for

326
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:48,930
that is one of the very first things

327
00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:51,510
we'll do with kids when they come join

328
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:53,460
these programs we talk about their game

329
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:55,590
pitches I don't know if you're familiar

330
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:57,240
with this but quite often you'll hear

331
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,710
there's a term called an elevator pitch

332
00:11:58,710 --> 00:12:01,260
where you have to try to exploit boil

333
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:02,910
your game down so that if you're talking

334
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:04,200
with someone in like two minutes you

335
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,210
could convey what it is and they could

336
00:12:06,210 --> 00:12:08,460
kind of buy into that and we took that a

337
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:09,830
step further than we're saying okay

338
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:12,000
typically I usually hear like say it's

339
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,100
like do this in two minutes we tell them

340
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,770
okay you've got 15 seconds to sell me on

341
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:19,770
your game and you know it's a tough

342
00:12:19,770 --> 00:12:21,240
challenge they don't they can't do that

343
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,250
right away they have to work on really

344
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:25,470
boiling down and distilling their game's

345
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:27,780
mechanics to the real core of what

346
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:29,940
they're trying to do it's a big

347
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:32,430
challenge but it really helps them think

348
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:33,930
critically about what they're trying to

349
00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:35,940
do because well quite often if you just

350
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:37,470
sort of let these young developers loose

351
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:39,000
they have a million ideas that go in a

352
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,560
million different directions and they

353
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,140
just spaghetti all over the place and by

354
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:45,300
kind of just saying hey take a step back

355
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:47,190
just think correctly about what you're

356
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:50,070
doing it really helps them focus it and

357
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:52,110
get started on the right foot and we

358
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:54,570
kind of carry all carry that through the

359
00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:57,570
whole process so that goes to you know

360
00:12:57,570 --> 00:12:59,160
thinking about their game mechanics you

361
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,960
know don't try to do a billion things

362
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,910
try to really hone in a couple really

363
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:04,920
core nice things you can execute well on

364
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:08,760
and it applies to all areas of their

365
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,800
design to you know their interface their

366
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,650
environment design just their just their

367
00:13:13,650 --> 00:13:14,830
game mechanics

368
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:16,360
because really once they do that then

369
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:17,740
they can arrive at a really nice clean

370
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:22,899
idea and execute on it and then another

371
00:13:22,899 --> 00:13:24,610
thing that we try to help them do again

372
00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:26,649
as I said a lot of these kids will come

373
00:13:26,649 --> 00:13:29,740
to us just again having done this all on

374
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:32,410
their own they you know just you know

375
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:34,089
we're in their bedroom and they just

376
00:13:34,089 --> 00:13:36,430
were hacking away and that's great they

377
00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:38,620
learned a lot but I think as you all

378
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:41,050
know any project of any kind of

379
00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:43,329
significant size even even smaller

380
00:13:43,329 --> 00:13:45,310
projects you really need to have a team

381
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:46,390
you can't do it alone

382
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:48,519
and that's a thing that a lot of these

383
00:13:48,519 --> 00:13:50,170
young developers don't always

384
00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:51,820
necessarily understand you know

385
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:53,380
sometimes they'll be working with their

386
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:55,390
friends and whatnot but by and large the

387
00:13:55,390 --> 00:13:57,250
pattern that I've seen is that they're

388
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:58,720
they're trying they think that they can

389
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:01,089
do it all and they try to do it all and

390
00:14:01,089 --> 00:14:03,910
I definitely encourage people to touch

391
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:05,950
all different areas of development I

392
00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:07,180
mean that's what I did on my journey I

393
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,010
was a full-stack engineer and learned

394
00:14:09,010 --> 00:14:10,329
very quickly about the areas of

395
00:14:10,329 --> 00:14:11,920
development that I didn't like so I

396
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,950
definitely like people exploring but I

397
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:16,779
do want people to kind of understand you

398
00:14:16,779 --> 00:14:18,040
know what are the areas that I'm really

399
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,720
passionate about because when you have

400
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:21,130
that sort of intrinsic motivation when

401
00:14:21,130 --> 00:14:23,020
you love what you're doing it makes it

402
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:24,959
that much more easy to be successful and

403
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:28,089
you know you make your projects work and

404
00:14:28,089 --> 00:14:29,440
so the things that we'll do with these

405
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,149
teams is we'll help them understand ok

406
00:14:31,149 --> 00:14:32,350
you know what are the things that you're

407
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:34,120
good at where are the things that you

408
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,920
enjoy doing and the things that you

409
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,209
either you know don't enjoy doing or

410
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:38,920
don't think you have the time for you

411
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,240
know let's help you figure out how to

412
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:43,029
form a team around that how can you you

413
00:14:43,029 --> 00:14:44,410
know hire artists how can you

414
00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:46,720
collaborate with other coders you know a

415
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,980
lot of these kids haven't worked with

416
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:49,899
any kind of you know source control or

417
00:14:49,899 --> 00:14:50,980
version or anything like that

418
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:53,260
so collaboration is a really big

419
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:55,209
learning for a lot of these young devs

420
00:14:55,209 --> 00:14:57,880
and then you know just even things in

421
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:59,860
terms of leadership and just the soft

422
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:01,449
skills involved with working with other

423
00:15:01,449 --> 00:15:03,790
people it's not all just tech you know

424
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:05,170
you have to get along with the people

425
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:06,730
you're working with or if you don't get

426
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:07,959
along you have to figure out how to not

427
00:15:07,959 --> 00:15:11,380
work with them and you know I I'm glad

428
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:12,550
that I don't have to do this but some of

429
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:14,110
the other people who work with these

430
00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:16,120
kids who are a little bit more closely

431
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,680
involved the program you know they're

432
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:20,079
dealing with just drama in situations

433
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:21,220
because you know they're just dealing

434
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:24,010
with humans these are things that you

435
00:15:24,010 --> 00:15:25,810
have to learn and fortunately for these

436
00:15:25,810 --> 00:15:27,160
developers they're learning it

437
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:33,129
early and the other thing that I kind of

438
00:15:33,129 --> 00:15:34,930
want to make sure that you sort of take

439
00:15:34,930 --> 00:15:36,190
away from this because this is a big

440
00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:38,350
thing that we also want to that we also

441
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:40,889
had to learn so somewhat the hard way is

442
00:15:40,889 --> 00:15:43,449
you know thinking about diversity in

443
00:15:43,449 --> 00:15:46,569
term in your for your developers and the

444
00:15:46,569 --> 00:15:48,149
kind of people that you're looking to

445
00:15:48,149 --> 00:15:51,069
attract again I'm not saying suggesting

446
00:15:51,069 --> 00:15:52,240
that all of you go out and start a

447
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,100
mentorship program and recruit 50 devs

448
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:57,730
to work for you you know this can go you

449
00:15:57,730 --> 00:15:59,470
know be as large or as small as you want

450
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:01,750
but you know when you're working with

451
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:03,610
anyone who you think has kind of that

452
00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:05,589
fire that sparked that vision that

453
00:16:05,589 --> 00:16:08,290
person who could really be encouraged to

454
00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:13,449
grow into a developer you know there's

455
00:16:13,449 --> 00:16:15,279
some times I've noticed in the industry

456
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:17,259
I mean this is true for gaming so I

457
00:16:17,259 --> 00:16:19,420
don't know if how widely it extends by

458
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:21,009
imagine it's pretty true for software

459
00:16:21,009 --> 00:16:23,800
there's this kind of celebrity persona

460
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,779
of like a hotshot developer or like a

461
00:16:25,779 --> 00:16:27,939
rock star and you know when you've set

462
00:16:27,939 --> 00:16:30,009
up programs to attract people like yeah

463
00:16:30,009 --> 00:16:31,360
let's get the best of the best of the

464
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,399
best you know well advertise like that

465
00:16:33,399 --> 00:16:34,959
we're like we are looking for the next

466
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:38,230
new stars looking for hotshots and you

467
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:40,449
know the truth of the matter is you know

468
00:16:40,449 --> 00:16:43,300
there's two things wrong with that one

469
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:46,509
you know a lot of people just don't

470
00:16:46,509 --> 00:16:50,019
self-identify that way you know when

471
00:16:50,019 --> 00:16:51,519
you're asking about that you're asking

472
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:52,959
for sort of like a personality type

473
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:56,319
rather than a skill set and you know

474
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:58,420
just a lot of people that you know I've

475
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:00,160
worked with through this program they

476
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,800
don't think of themselves as like

477
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,910
celebrities in the programming world you

478
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:04,990
know they just want to work they just

479
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:07,600
want to learn skills they want to do a

480
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:11,650
certain project and you know that's

481
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:13,329
something that we had to learn and we

482
00:17:13,329 --> 00:17:15,760
had to to work to diversify our teams

483
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:18,100
was to say like okay you know let's not

484
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:19,720
focus on like trying to get the best of

485
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:20,589
the best of the best

486
00:17:20,589 --> 00:17:22,689
let's try to get a big range of people

487
00:17:22,689 --> 00:17:24,789
because they're gonna give us you know

488
00:17:24,789 --> 00:17:27,220
not they're gonna give us a really good

489
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:28,960
wealth of feedback to because they're

490
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,960
coming from so many different areas of

491
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,610
expertise and so you know we look for

492
00:17:33,610 --> 00:17:35,710
people that not necessarily are like top

493
00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:37,870
of their field but we try to find people

494
00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:39,650
who really have dry

495
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:41,390
and have passion and look like they're

496
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:43,580
really gonna stick with something so not

497
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:45,200
someone who so will definitely accept

498
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,790
people into our programs who aren't you

499
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:48,290
know mate maybe they have a lot to learn

500
00:17:48,290 --> 00:17:50,300
in terms of like technical skills but

501
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:51,590
they've shown that they're like yeah you

502
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:53,660
know I've you've got a lot to learn

503
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:54,950
learn but I've worked on this game for

504
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:56,420
three years it's my passion project

505
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:59,090
we're like that's really cool we want to

506
00:17:59,090 --> 00:18:00,860
help you overcome whatever things are

507
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:04,190
stopping you from from making it and so

508
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:07,070
you know by focusing on you know the

509
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:09,740
passion and the drive you know you help

510
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:11,090
out these people because you're setting

511
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:13,280
also setting them up for expectations of

512
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:16,010
you know we're gonna focus on not you

513
00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:18,170
know boosting your ego and making you

514
00:18:18,170 --> 00:18:19,700
feel really cool but we're gonna help

515
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:21,890
you do really cool things and that's so

516
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:23,300
it's gonna help you get a bigger range

517
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:25,040
of people to just the talent pool is

518
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:27,050
much wider if you you know think about

519
00:18:27,050 --> 00:18:29,570
just you know you know passion and drive

520
00:18:29,570 --> 00:18:36,410
I think and so you know where what what

521
00:18:36,410 --> 00:18:39,500
to do with this again as I said I'm not

522
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,809
really fully expecting anyone here to

523
00:18:41,809 --> 00:18:45,110
you know set up big programs I think

524
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:47,360
that this can work at scale at pretty

525
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,070
much any level you know so if you do

526
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:50,390
work with some kind of like developer

527
00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:52,250
relations team like I do you can

528
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:54,710
probably you know do some sorts of

529
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:56,360
mentorships you know either in person or

530
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:59,900
virtually you know a large scale but it

531
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:02,150
can also just work with one person you

532
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:04,309
know if there's someone in your

533
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:06,620
community someone your family a friend

534
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:09,320
that you know you know I think that

535
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:11,090
these sorts of lessons about you know

536
00:19:11,090 --> 00:19:13,820
just teaching them how to realize their

537
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:15,590
dreams instead of just saying you know

538
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:16,880
hey you want to be a software engineer

539
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,559
just do this project this project this

540
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:20,750
project you're done you know really help

541
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:23,750
them explore the ideas that they want to

542
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:25,370
do and help them think through the

543
00:19:25,370 --> 00:19:26,750
problems that they're going to encounter

544
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:29,390
facing that because you know really

545
00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:30,679
there's so many people in so many

546
00:19:30,679 --> 00:19:32,120
different ideas that we're not gonna be

547
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:34,040
able to help them we're you know they're

548
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,090
just gonna come up with all kinds of

549
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:37,010
things that will never think of and the

550
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:38,840
things that we can do as industry

551
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:40,670
experts and as veterans as we can

552
00:19:40,670 --> 00:19:42,920
you know help them just understand what

553
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,929
the stumbling blocks will be help them

554
00:19:44,929 --> 00:19:47,870
understand you know what what challenges

555
00:19:47,870 --> 00:19:51,050
will will get in their way

556
00:19:51,050 --> 00:19:53,150
and so you know that's that's very good

557
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:54,680
for like a one-on-one mentorship thing

558
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,240
and then you know also there's never

559
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,680
been a better time for people to just

560
00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:01,670
get started as well you know sometimes

561
00:20:01,670 --> 00:20:02,930
you know I was saying you know don't do

562
00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:04,250
like I have you handed do this project

563
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:06,260
do this prior to this project that's

564
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:07,430
true although I do think you know when

565
00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:09,830
you're very very very green and new is

566
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:11,300
nice to have sort of project-based

567
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:13,340
learning to kind of help you get started

568
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:15,290
and there's lots of great resources for

569
00:20:15,290 --> 00:20:17,300
that the power of code is a really

570
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:20,600
really big thing now you know a lot and

571
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:23,450
there's a huge wealth of camps programs

572
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:25,310
and stuff that you know particularly

573
00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:27,140
kids can get involved with to get

574
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:28,850
started but again I definitely want to

575
00:20:28,850 --> 00:20:30,800
make sure that you know if you're you

576
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,630
know if you're if you again have like a

577
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:33,650
young person in your life you're like

578
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:35,270
okay there's this cool camp that you can

579
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:36,620
go to there's this cool class that you

580
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:39,050
can take well make sure that you know

581
00:20:39,050 --> 00:20:41,630
you help them think about again just the

582
00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:42,890
things that they're trying to make and

583
00:20:42,890 --> 00:20:44,930
not just say hey you should go to this

584
00:20:44,930 --> 00:20:46,670
camp because learning programming is

585
00:20:46,670 --> 00:20:48,110
good you know we're going to the Future

586
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:49,310
everyone's going to need to know some

587
00:20:49,310 --> 00:20:50,900
kind of programming which i think is

588
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:53,300
true but you know help them understand

589
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:55,130
why that's important especially if they

590
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:57,080
do you know play games or if they do

591
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:59,720
like like some app on their phone or if

592
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,550
they do like some website they're like

593
00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:03,350
man it'll be really cool you know I can

594
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:05,360
maybe make that help them understand yes

595
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,910
you actually can make these things you

596
00:21:07,910 --> 00:21:09,020
know these things were made by people

597
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:11,810
just like you and you can get there and

598
00:21:11,810 --> 00:21:13,580
all you need to do is just give them the

599
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:16,520
tools and caps or the guidance to make

600
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:17,260
that happen

601
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:23,540
so and yeah I'm got a little bit of time

602
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:25,460
left but yeah pretty much out of slides

603
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:27,320
but thank you very much everyone it's
