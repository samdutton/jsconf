1
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:27,470
Hi everyone, and thank you for being here.

2
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:31,480
I am
Razvan, I work for Adobe with a bunch of awesome

3
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:35,530
people
on interesting things like CSS shapes, masking,

4
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:39,390
CSS
blend modes, CSS regions, some of you may

5
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:42,960
know me for
building the CSS shapes added to your Chrome

6
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,890
extension
which allows you to edit shapes on the browser.

7
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:48,930
In
general I work on practical things.

8
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:53,420
None of that
matters today, because today I want to show

9
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:56,780
you
something which I'm fascinated about, and

10
00:00:56,780 --> 00:01:00,980
that is
unconventional uses of technology to admit

11
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:02,960
data and
input.

12
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:09,979
This isn't so much a talk, but actually just
a collection of demos other people have built,

13
00:01:09,979 --> 00:01:12,360
and
stories I founding really interesting in the

14
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:16,470
sense that
they use technology in unexpected ways with

15
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:21,320
unexpected
results ... so today I'm going to go briefly

16
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:25,450
into sound,
how we can transmit data using sound, and

17
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:29,680
how we can
build our own cheap version of the litmotion

18
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,820
just using
sounds on your laptop.

19
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:36,399
Then I'm just going to talk
about a way of using light to communicate

20
00:01:36,399 --> 00:01:38,890
to your
computer, and if there's time depending, two

21
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:41,130
short
stories about interesting ways to transmit

22
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:43,200
input to
devices.

23
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,369
So without further ado, let's begin.

24
00:01:47,369 --> 00:01:49,619
The year is 2013, October.

25
00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:54,079
I come across this
article on arstechnica, and it is about a

26
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:58,280
respected
security researcher who supposedly found this

27
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:00,479
sophisticated piece of malware.

28
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:04,929
This was infecting his
machines and spreading by ultrasound.

29
00:02:04,929 --> 00:02:09,270
What is more
devious about it is that it couldn't be diagnosed

30
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:12,510
with
forensic stools, and it didn't leave any traces.

31
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:14,620
That
was odd.

32
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:20,319
This guy found out the ultrasound was the
means of infection by repeatedly removing

33
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:26,300
stuff from the
computers, the hard drive, network interface,

34
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:29,370
the
memory, he changed so many components, and

35
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:32,140
it wasn't
until he actually removed the soundcard, which

36
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:34,819
was
controlling the speakers and microphone, that

37
00:02:34,819 --> 00:02:36,260
the
infection stopped.

38
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:41,269
Now, these claims are being contested by other
security researchers who haven't been able

39
00:02:41,269 --> 00:02:45,599
to reproduce
the same effects using the logs.

40
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:49,629
But other security
researchers have proved that it is actually

41
00:02:49,629 --> 00:02:53,150
possible to
infect the bias of another computer just using

42
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:55,349
ultrasound.

43
00:02:55,349 --> 00:02:57,739
Quite scary, if you ask me.

44
00:02:57,739 --> 00:03:01,480
Around the same time, Boris Smus is an engineer
for

45
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:05,959
Google, he was playing around with the WebAudio
API and

46
00:03:05,959 --> 00:03:10,329
trying to send data between devices using
messages

47
00:03:10,329 --> 00:03:12,680
encoded as ultrasound.

48
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:16,599
And he put together this library
called Sonicnet.JS, which I'm going to use

49
00:03:16,599 --> 00:03:20,640
today, and
the way this works is that it takes a part

50
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,659
of the sound
spectrum, specifically the part where you

51
00:03:23,659 --> 00:03:27,579
can't hear it,
the ultrasound spectrum, and it chunks that

52
00:03:27,579 --> 00:03:31,540
into various
bits and pieces and each letter of the alphabet

53
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:34,531
gets
a portion of this ultrasound spectrum, so

54
00:03:34,531 --> 00:03:38,550
when you want
to send a message, you essentially encode

55
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:42,120
this as
ultrasound and send it in a frequency which,

56
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,840
as adults,
we can't hear.

57
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:50,519
Some pets can hear it and small
children, but it is kind of invisible or inaudible,

58
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:52,390
but
rather than talk about it, I want to show

59
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:53,989
you a demo.

60
00:03:53,989 --> 00:03:58,780
Full disclosure, this is a demo idea I took
from Boris's

61
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,239
original experiments.

62
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:03,319
I just adapted it for this
presentation.

63
00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:06,290
So all credit goes to him on that.

64
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:09,230
What I'm going to do here, exit full screen
mode and

65
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:11,750
on the right-hand side of the screen you're
going to see

66
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:14,570
that I have this demo running on two devices:
one is my

67
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:17,460
laptop and the other is a phone I have connected
over

68
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:19,910
here via cable.

69
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:25,130
They're both running the same demo and
what I'm going to try to do is get them synchronised

70
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:28,230
just using ultrasound, and I really really
hope this

71
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:30,590
works because there's so many things to go
wrong with

72
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:33,000
the demos today.

73
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,890
Okay.

74
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:39,550
So just to get a sense of what is going on
here, I'm going to turn on the visualiser.

75
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:42,650
This is
bouncing around because it is hearing me speak,

76
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:44,860
but as
I'm going to click on the icons on each one

77
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:47,889
of the
devices, they are going to send out a message

78
00:04:47,889 --> 00:04:50,720
in encoded
ultrasound, and you're going to see a distinct

79
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,220
peak
towards the right-hand side of the spectrum

80
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:54,740
over there.

81
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:56,430
Let's try this.

82
00:04:56,430 --> 00:05:02,240
I'll start with my phone and start
sending emoticons to my laptop.

83
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,990
It works!

84
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:11,280


85
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:17,240
This is unexpected.

86
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,240
It works.

87
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,680
Most of the time it
works.

88
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,650
My laptop is picking up the ultrasound from
the

89
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:27,990
phone, the phone itself, sometimes it doesn't
actually

90
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:31,810
catch its own ultrasound back, so the speaker
is over

91
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:34,259
here and the microphone is down here.

92
00:05:34,259 --> 00:05:36,759
And there is
actually a big caveat with microphones and

93
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:37,759
phones.

94
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:39,490
They're optimised for speech, not necessarily
for

95
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:40,490
ultrasound.

96
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:43,780
This is one of the few devices I have which
actually works with this.

97
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:47,280
But if you don't have
ultrasound capable devices, you can do the

98
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:51,639
other thing
and reverse, you can use audible sound spectrum,

99
00:05:51,639 --> 00:05:54,759
so I'm
going to switch both devices to audible.

100
00:05:54,759 --> 00:05:55,759
Okay.

101
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:56,759
Allow.

102
00:05:56,759 --> 00:05:58,680
And this is going to blast out a very annoying
high

103
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:01,520
pitched sound, but doing essentially the same
thing, so

104
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:08,870
I'll try this with my laptop now.

105
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:13,230
You can probably pick
it up from my microphone.

106
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:15,870
Ah.

107
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:20,819
Okay, it worked.

108
00:06:20,819 --> 00:06:22,190
[applause].

109
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:26,569
You can't believe how
happy I am.

110
00:06:26,569 --> 00:06:31,680
I tried it many times, but all props to
Boris, who built the library.

111
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:36,440
His work is amazing, and
he should get the applause.

112
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:39,870
So use case for this, we
synchronise two devices.

113
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:44,009
Google used this library with
a few motivations to use Google tone.

114
00:06:44,009 --> 00:06:46,490
This is a browser
extension which allows people who have the

115
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:50,780
same
extension to share links using audible sound.

116
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:53,550
It has
a nicer sound, but essentially if you're in

117
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:55,441
the room
with someone, you want to share a link, you

118
00:06:55,441 --> 00:06:59,129
just press
a button and your laptop just speaks the link

119
00:06:59,129 --> 00:07:02,250
towards
the other device, which is kind of cool.

120
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:04,500
It works over
handouts, over a lot of things.

121
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:08,449
Nobody has to install
everything more than Chrome, in this extension.

122
00:07:08,449 --> 00:07:12,030
The big
problem, though, is that you have to -- your

123
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:15,770
laptop is
always listening to the environment, so it

124
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:16,870
can pick up
these links.

125
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:20,910
And I don't know about you, but that kind
of creeps me out, so I don't use it.

126
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:23,220
Nonetheless, very
cool extension.

127
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:27,870
Okay, switching gears to motion sensing using
ultrasound.

128
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:30,240
This one is very cool.

129
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,620
So the doppler
effect.

130
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:34,139
You've all experienced these.

131
00:07:34,139 --> 00:07:39,580
The doppler
effect is this phenomenon of the apparent

132
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:44,000
frequency
shift of a wave to a static observer as the

133
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,110
wave is
being emitted by something in motion.

134
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:50,751
So imagine the
last time you heard an ambulance siren, as

135
00:07:50,751 --> 00:07:53,430
the ambulance
is travelling towards you, you're hearing

136
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:57,509
a higher and
higher pitch and the reason is that the source

137
00:07:57,509 --> 00:07:59,680
of the
sound, the ambulance, is travelling, and each

138
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,580
soundwave
has to travel less and less to get to your

139
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:04,940
ear,
therefore you're going to have more soundwaves

140
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:08,169
hitting
your ear as the ambulance travels towards

141
00:08:08,169 --> 00:08:09,169
you.

142
00:08:09,169 --> 00:08:11,520
The same
thing happens in reverse as it goes away from

143
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:15,370
you:
soundwaves have to travel longer to get to

144
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:18,080
you because
the source of the sound is going away, therefore

145
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:21,759
the
pitch sounds like it is going lower and lower.

146
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:24,770
This is one of the fundamental principles
in radar.

147
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:27,069
In radar, you have a base station which is
emitting

148
00:08:27,069 --> 00:08:29,800
a radio frequency, and it is listening for
that same

149
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,720
frequency around the same spectrum.

150
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:36,030
Those radio
frequencies are going to bounce back everything

151
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:38,720
they
hit, so if you have an aeroplane in motion

152
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:41,710
coming
towards you, the radar is able to use the

153
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:44,910
doppler effect
in a lot more technology in maths than I'm

154
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:47,560
capable of,
to basically determine if the aeroplane is

155
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:50,630
coming
towards it or going away, then using an array

156
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:53,930
of radar
systems you actually know where that aeroplane

157
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:58,000
is in
space by triangulating the sound.

158
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,029
Of course we have
everything to build a radar system in the

159
00:09:03,029 --> 00:09:06,570
computers,
first of all replace the base station with

160
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:09,390
our laptop
speakers, and we have the microphone over

161
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:13,930
there, and
then we can use our hand to basically understand

162
00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:16,060
where
it is in relationship to the speakers and

163
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:19,950
what -- how
we're going to do that is use ultrasound.

164
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:26,250
Daniel Rapp
built this very small library called doppler.

165
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:29,690
It sends
out an ultrasound from my laptop speakers

166
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:31,990
and is also
back for the same frequency.

167
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:37,010
What you're seeing on
screen right now, once it settles, is actually

168
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:40,570
my laptop
emitting around 20-kilohertz sound.

169
00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:43,029
You can't hear it,
I can't hear it, but it is here.

170
00:09:43,029 --> 00:09:46,450
There's this graph on
the screen here showing the difference between

171
00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:48,930
the
frequency emitted and what's coming back.

172
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:51,490
So as
I introduce something in the vicinity of the

173
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:53,820
speakers,
like my hand, and I'm wiggling around, I'm

174
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:57,720
able to
affect the way the echo is going back.

175
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:00,200
Remember, the
radar, and the doppler effect.

176
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:05,480
And so I can pull up and
essentially, that's changing the way the sound

177
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,440
is
reflecting back into the speakers.

178
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,720
Or I can push
down -- [applause].

179
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:17,880
I know, it's awesome.

180
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:18,880
What can we do with this?

181
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:23,260
We're getting quite a lot
of resolution here with my hands, but we can

182
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:25,590
only look
at the peaks and tie these to something.

183
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:28,110
So for
example, let's say we want to scale a balloon.

184
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:34,570
I can do
these ample gestures or hit it so it goes

185
00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:36,020
right back
down.

186
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:38,920
There you go.

187
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:39,920
Very cool.

188
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:43,600
This like the poor
man's version of the leap motion.

189
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,300
Therefore we can use
it for something practical.

190
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:50,339
We have some interference
but I can use these gestures, scroll a page

191
00:10:50,339 --> 00:10:56,860
up and down
so I don't actually have to use my mouse.

192
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:58,200
[applause].

193
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,260
This is absolutely interesting because you
clapping

194
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:03,320
are affecting my demo, but please do that.

195
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,459
That's fine.

196
00:11:05,459 --> 00:11:08,300
Because this is actually changing the echo
in the room

197
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:10,880
that my laptop picks up a different sort of
echo as

198
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,480
people are moving across the room, which is
kind of

199
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,480
cool.

200
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,540
All right, if you can do these things, we
can turn

201
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:19,589
into Darth Vader and just turn on and adopt
a navigation

202
00:11:19,589 --> 00:11:21,930
for the entire presentation, and say I want
to go

203
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:26,029
back -- you've seen this before -- or I want
to go

204
00:11:26,029 --> 00:11:30,139
forward, do we want to plug in for reveal
with this?

205
00:11:30,139 --> 00:11:32,550
Yeah we do.

206
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:33,990
Okay.

207
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:34,990
That was sound.

208
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:36,730
And I'm glad those
demos worked.

209
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:38,329
Let's move over to light.

210
00:11:38,329 --> 00:11:42,360
So I want to
talk about light.

211
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:46,610
The man on the left-hand side of the
screen over there is using a device called

212
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:51,360
a heliograph
... now a heliograph is a simple system of

213
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:55,279
mirrors which
focuses sunlight towards a target which is

214
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:56,410
farther away.

215
00:11:56,410 --> 00:12:00,570
Ending a simple system of levers, the operator
can

216
00:12:00,570 --> 00:12:05,320
flashlight towards the target on and off,
you can encode

217
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:08,500
essentially Morse code, sending it to the
other person

218
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,800
listening to you.

219
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:14,529
At the other end, there is another
person either with a sighting scope or another

220
00:12:14,529 --> 00:12:16,820
heliograph line, and what is cool is you can
get

221
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:21,260
10 miles of range for every inch of the mirror,
which is

222
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:23,910
kind of amazing.

223
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:27,010
The record for range held by a heliograph
team is

224
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:33,889
300 kilometres, yes, between two mountains
using mirrors

225
00:12:33,889 --> 00:12:36,711
about eight inches in in diameter, and this
was

226
00:12:36,711 --> 00:12:42,220
happening in 1895.

227
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:47,209
There's only one drawback to this:
if there's no sun, there's no messages.

228
00:12:47,209 --> 00:12:48,209
There's the
limitation.

229
00:12:48,209 --> 00:12:49,980
If it's raining, we stop.

230
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:53,940
So the design
evolved to this device called a signalling

231
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:56,970
lamp, and
still being used by navies today in exercises

232
00:12:56,970 --> 00:12:59,230
where they
have to maintain radio silence.

233
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:02,370
So instead of the sun,
you have a bright light inside of the device,

234
00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:04,710
and
a series of shutters in front of it.

235
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:09,030
The operator is
using that lever on the side to open and close

236
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:11,519
the
shutters, therefore encoding a message and

237
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:16,740
send Morse
code to a receiver at the other end.

238
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:20,870
Bear this in mind as I continue.

239
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:22,949
Ambient light
event.

240
00:13:22,949 --> 00:13:29,170
The ambient light event API is something your
computer has to essentially detect the light

241
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:33,240
level in
the room, and adapt your screen intensity

242
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:35,430
to the light
intensity in your room.

243
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:39,279
So right now, we have about 42
locks, there's nothing changing over there.

244
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:41,750
If I put my
hand in front of the light sensor here, you

245
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:43,769
see that's
going down.

246
00:13:43,769 --> 00:13:47,570
Or I can do something else, I can turn on
the flashlight and you see that's going to

247
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:49,180
go really,
really high.

248
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:50,610
There you go.

249
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:55,860
It's off the charts,
absolutely off the charts.

250
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:58,970
Okay.

251
00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:05,779
The textbook example for ambient light events
is to adapt the page so you get better readability

252
00:14:05,779 --> 00:14:06,990
in
low light conditions.

253
00:14:06,990 --> 00:14:10,861
So if I put my hand in front of
the light sensor next to the camera, that's

254
00:14:10,861 --> 00:14:13,300
going to
reduce the light, I can change the document

255
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:16,240
style sheet
so it is better to read in low light.

256
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:19,279
As I put my hand
away, I can read it, therefore the slide sheet

257
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:23,050
changes
and I can do this over and over again.

258
00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:25,680
But notice my
hand doesn't really affect too much of the

259
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:33,050
light sensor
the value is pretty low imports.

260
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:38,560
What if we use ambient
light events and Morse code?

261
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:42,019
What if we can send
messages in Morse code to the computer using

262
00:14:42,019 --> 00:14:44,420
that light
sensor?

263
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:47,649
Let's try my most brutal demo ever.

264
00:14:47,649 --> 00:14:49,850
This is
optical Morse code, so I'm going to turn on

265
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:54,329
an
application on my phone which sends SOS, it

266
00:14:54,329 --> 00:14:57,410
sends any
message in Morse code as flashes of light,

267
00:14:57,410 --> 00:15:02,449
so I'm going
to try to send an SOS to my computer.

268
00:15:02,449 --> 00:15:04,820
Okay.

269
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:07,850
So SOS is
essentially three dots, three dashes, three

270
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:08,850
dots.

271
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:11,760
That's really going off the chart over there,
which is

272
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:12,760
good.

273
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:19,260
I like that.

274
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:26,480
There you go.

275
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,480
It worked.

276
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,480
Cool.
applause].

277
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:32,230
Just in case you're thinking this is a very
engineered demo, I am going to type something

278
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:38,149
longer,
like JSconf, and this is going to take a while,

279
00:15:38,149 --> 00:15:39,149
actually.

280
00:15:39,149 --> 00:15:44,770
So let's try JSconf.

281
00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:47,840
One thing to note about
the ambient light sensor is that this is not

282
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:48,840
a stream.

283
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:51,920
You're going to get events from the light
sensor going

284
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:55,300
up and down, but you're not going to get them
in a very

285
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:58,380
predictable fashion, so I had to build a very
simple

286
00:15:58,380 --> 00:15:59,380
sampler.

287
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:00,889
It is basically sampling the light sensor
once

288
00:16:00,889 --> 00:16:03,470
every frame, so really hitting it hard.

289
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:05,470
So I can decode
those messages.

290
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:06,670
Come on.

291
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:09,250
F is always difficult.

292
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:10,710
JSconf.

293
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:12,170
Yes.

294
00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:16,559
It worked ... [applause].

295
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:20,199
So happy about
it.

296
00:16:20,199 --> 00:16:24,680
I am particularly happy that this thing worked,
because it shouldn't.

297
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:30,259
The reason is so you can argue
this thing will only work in Firefox, and

298
00:16:30,259 --> 00:16:33,350
it is only in
Chrome behind the flag, so you need to enable

299
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:34,350
it.

300
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:35,740
You
can argue: well, you should turn on the camera

301
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:38,769
and
listen to the ambient light event with a much

302
00:16:38,769 --> 00:16:41,820
higher
frequency -- sorry, listen to the camera and

303
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:43,959
decode in
the images in the camera, but there's only

304
00:16:43,959 --> 00:16:47,550
one small
problem: you need to ask the user for permission

305
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:49,000
to use
their camera.

306
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,700
You don't need to ask them for permission
to use the ambient light sensor.

307
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:56,020
And this is a major
privacy concern.

308
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:58,420
And the people writing the spec
thought about this.

309
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:02,680
That's why you're not going to get
very predictable and accurate results from

310
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:04,230
the light
sensor.

311
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:08,670
Essentially, because you can do a low file
alternative to bluetooth beacons and fingerprint

312
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:10,890
people
without their knowledge.

313
00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:14,190
So here is a use-case.

314
00:17:14,190 --> 00:17:17,920
You're
walking around the store, a phone in hand,

315
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:20,569
using an
application, and that application is looking

316
00:17:20,569 --> 00:17:23,270
as
monitoring light change events.

317
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:27,240
You want to enter
a store, a light above your head at the entrance

318
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,940
is
flashing a very distinct pattern.

319
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:31,950
Your application
knows you went into the store.

320
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:33,300
You go to an aisle.

321
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:35,220
A different light is flashing a different
sort of

322
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,250
pattern.

323
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:40,590
The application knows you're in that aisle,
therefore it can push notification and do

324
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:42,930
analytics and
do anything.

325
00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:45,950
You go to the checkout and have
a different light pulsating in a different

326
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:50,200
pattern, and
the application knows you have paid.

327
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:52,070
You understand what's going on over here.

328
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:56,200
It sounds
a bit dystopian, and if it sounds improbable

329
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:59,890
it
shouldn't, because this thing happened.

330
00:17:59,890 --> 00:18:02,890
This is an
experiment that Phillips did with a major

331
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:06,140
retailer in
France, and they're using a technology called

332
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:09,080
VLC,
visible light communication, and the way this

333
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:13,150
works is
it attaches a light controller to normal LED

334
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:16,020
lightbulbs
and causes them to flash in a very distinct

335
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:19,350
pattern
which we, as humans, can't observe, but sensors

336
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:21,840
on our
phones can.

337
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:26,810
So essentially what they built, they meshed
out the entire store with different lights

338
00:18:26,810 --> 00:18:29,700
so you can
build an indoor GPS navigation system for

339
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:33,030
that store,
you can ask for directions to the toilet paper

340
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:35,580
aisle and
it will give the directions.

341
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:40,720
It's cool, but you need to
offer permissions to do this, so this wasn't

342
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:45,310
necessarily
a privacy infringement, but a very cool experiment.

343
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:48,230
The
technology is called VLC, visible light communication

344
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:51,240
and I strongly urge you go look into it.

345
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:54,810
Some people
see this as the future beyond wi-fi, mainly

346
00:18:54,810 --> 00:18:58,560
because it
has 10,000 times more spectrum than radio

347
00:18:58,560 --> 00:18:59,560
wi-fi.

348
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:02,650
It is
kind of cool.

349
00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:06,060
But this isn't anything new.

350
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:12,080
This is the Timex data
link watch, which could be called the grandfather

351
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,080
of
smartwatches nowadays.

352
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:19,430
This was first marketed in 1994,
and the special thing about it is you can

353
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:23,480
store phone
numbers or 'to do' lists on your watch.

354
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,650
But that's not
very interesting.

355
00:19:24,650 --> 00:19:28,010
The interesting bit is how you got
those things to your watch.

356
00:19:28,010 --> 00:19:31,040
And it doesn't use a cable,
it uses light.

357
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:36,260
So above the display over there at the
12th hour there's a small camera, and that

358
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:39,630
camera,
coupled with an application for your computer,

359
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:42,830
is going
to receive flight pulses from your monitor

360
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:45,520
and encode
them as messages.

361
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:50,280
But rather than explain how this
works, I would want to show you the commercial

362
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:53,651
for the
Timex datalink watch from 1994, and this is

363
00:19:53,651 --> 00:19:55,540
where I'm
going to need help from the sound people because

364
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:58,370
I connected my sound and this is something
you need to

365
00:19:58,370 --> 00:20:05,780
hear.

366
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:20,600
All good?

367
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:28,010
Good.

368
00:20:28,010 --> 00:20:35,420
music].

369
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:37,490
The cat always wins.

370
00:20:37,490 --> 00:20:38,800
[applause].

371
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,650
I find it funny.

372
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:45,940
The cat always wins, the dog has no chance.

373
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:49,520
This was 1994.

374
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,760
That was 21 years ago.

375
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:54,110
Some of the
people in this room today weren't even born

376
00:20:54,110 --> 00:20:57,770
when people
were trying out technology like this.

377
00:20:57,770 --> 00:21:01,490
So let's fast
forward 21 years, where are we today?

378
00:21:01,490 --> 00:21:05,530
This thing is
called the Michigan micromould.

379
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:08,170
By all accounts, this
is the smallest computer in the world right

380
00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:09,170
now.

381
00:21:09,170 --> 00:21:11,150
That
is not a huge coin, that's a small coin, and

382
00:21:11,150 --> 00:21:13,190
the
computer fits on the size of the coin.

383
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:18,010
It has
everything you need: processor, memory, storage,

384
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:20,000
and
a small battery.

385
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,800
It has radio, it has some sensors like
temperature and light sensors, and it all

386
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:27,630
fits on the
side of a coin.

387
00:21:27,630 --> 00:21:33,250
So this size begs the question: how do
you actually -- there is no room to put a

388
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:36,350
connector, how
do you program this thing and charge it?

389
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:39,570
The answer is:
use light.

390
00:21:39,570 --> 00:21:44,760
The micro mode is initially programmed with
light pulses, and by the way that's the tiny

391
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:47,920
black thing
underneath the lightbulb over there: the entire

392
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:48,920
computer.

393
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:53,460
So the initial programming phase is done by
light phases up until it boots up and turns

394
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:57,290
on the
radio, so it can use the network to get further

395
00:21:57,290 --> 00:21:59,460
instructions.

396
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:01,680
This is absolutely incredible.

397
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:06,530
I am both
amazed and terrified at the size of computers.

398
00:22:06,530 --> 00:22:09,040
Okay.

399
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:11,530
Since I have a bit more time left, I am going
to go into

400
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:15,500
the other section, and this my favourite one.

401
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:18,480
This
device is called the Misfit Shine, one of

402
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:22,860
the earliest
fitness trackers, and in the video they alleged

403
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:26,220
it would
synchronise by you placing it on the screen

404
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:27,560
of your
phone.

405
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:31,010
And people went crazy for it, myself included.

406
00:22:31,010 --> 00:22:33,390
We didn't know how this was going to be done,
we were

407
00:22:33,390 --> 00:22:38,720
very curious, myself included: is it rhythmically
tapping on the screen to get the message,

408
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,540
something like
Morse code tapping?

409
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:41,540
Is it generating electromagnetic
field?

410
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:42,540
Sadly, no.

411
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:49,030
The 
Misfit Shine eventually

412
00:22:49,030 --> 00:22:51,180
launched, and the answer is it is just using
bluetooth

413
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:55,560
low energy, which is useful because it is
a high

414
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:58,040
bandwidth way of transmitting data, and you're
a lot

415
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:04,510
less prone to errors, but the important bit
is it is use

416
00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:07,880
bluetooth in a very low frequency so you need
to keep it

417
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:11,610
close to your device, so you need to put it
on the

418
00:23:11,610 --> 00:23:14,011
screen for it to synchronise, but it would
actually do

419
00:23:14,011 --> 00:23:16,210
it if you just put it next to the phone and
tap that

420
00:23:16,210 --> 00:23:18,730
circle there.

421
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:24,140
A bit disappointing, but it is not
totally impossible to do that.

422
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:26,030
This is the Google Cardboard, most people
in the

423
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:28,200
room probably know what this is.

424
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:31,080
One of the low-cost VR
headset.

425
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:36,290
It is basically a piece of cardboard you
put -- you open an application, you put your

426
00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:39,100
phone in
there, you put it up to your head and you're

427
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:42,890
projecting
into a 3D virtual world, but that introduces

428
00:23:42,890 --> 00:23:46,550
a problem
and the problem is how do you actually interact

429
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:48,720
with
your phone when it is in a box stuck to your

430
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,330
head?

431
00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:52,440
You
could try using the camera or you could try

432
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:54,890
using the
microphone, but those need user permissions,

433
00:23:54,890 --> 00:23:56,950
first of
all, an extra step.

434
00:23:56,950 --> 00:24:01,200
They're going to drain the battery
very fast, and if you're in a noisy environment

435
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:04,700
or in an
environment with a lot of light, they may

436
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:07,460
not be that
precise to begin with.

437
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:10,200
So the engineers come up with a brilliant
solution:

438
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:13,670
on the side there you're going to see a circular
metal

439
00:24:13,670 --> 00:24:17,330
disc, a magnet, and it travels up and down
in a groove.

440
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:19,890
On the other side, there's another magnet
which stays

441
00:24:19,890 --> 00:24:23,200
fixed, and as you pull them, you're actually
changing

442
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,760
the electromagnetic field between those.

443
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:28,670
So the
engineers for the Google Cardboard app are

444
00:24:28,670 --> 00:24:31,850
looking with
the magnetometer for the changes in the electromagnetic

445
00:24:31,850 --> 00:24:34,210
field, this is the same sensor you're using
for the

446
00:24:34,210 --> 00:24:37,520
compass, and therefore that's the input device.

447
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:41,680
You can
register clicks, long presses, just by measuring

448
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:45,620
the
changes detected by the magnetometer.

449
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:48,200
Absolutely
brilliant.

450
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:51,270
Unfortunately we can't do this in browsers
today.

451
00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:54,000
I would love to show you a demo like this,
but the truth

452
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,741
is we don't have access to most of the APIs
in our

453
00:24:56,741 --> 00:24:57,741
phones.

454
00:24:57,741 --> 00:25:02,550
We know about the browsers, but not much about
the underlying sensors, and if there is anything

455
00:25:02,550 --> 00:25:06,170
practical to take way from this presentation
today, is

456
00:25:06,170 --> 00:25:10,620
if you want access to all of the sensors in
your devices

457
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:13,880
in your browser to build your own unconventional
use of

458
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:17,120
them, I encourage you to get involved in the
generic web

459
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,410
sensor API.

460
00:25:18,410 --> 00:25:25,140
It is at URL, an ongoing specification to
make a uniform way of exposing sensors for

461
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:28,260
us and
browsers to use, because until we have access

462
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:31,350
to the
sensors on the device, native is fundamentally

463
00:25:31,350 --> 00:25:33,670
going to
be ahead of the web.

464
00:25:33,670 --> 00:25:37,400
So we need access to sensors.

465
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:40,050
And
that's about it for my presentation.

466
00:25:40,050 --> 00:25:44,800
I hope you enjoyed
it, I hope you found some bits of insight,

467
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:47,790
and
I encourage you to look for your own unconventional

468
00:25:47,790 --> 00:25:50,170
ways
of transmitting data and input in whatever

469
00:25:50,170 --> 00:25:52,640
you do with
your devices.

470
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,640
Thank you for your attention.
