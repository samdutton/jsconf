1
00:00:05,029 --> 00:00:11,790

test testing yeah well better hmm

2
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:17,490
feedback good yeah awesome okay so uh

3
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:20,039
what makes something revolutionary all

4
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:23,130
right something is revolutionary if it

5
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:25,230
totally disrupts the established order

6
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:28,949
and it replaces this order with a new

7
00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:31,140
order namely itself and it's going to

8
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:33,090
completely change the dynamics of

9
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:35,399
everything around it so we've been

10
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:37,620
witnessing this massive shift in

11
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:39,660
front-end development it's becoming one

12
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:41,399
of the most in-demand specializations

13
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:45,390
and we we have all these new tools and

14
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:47,940
frameworks that are really not only

15
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:50,399
changing our lives as developers and

16
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:52,230
designers but they're affecting how we

17
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:55,110
do things on a day-to-day basis and it's

18
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:59,399
this it's their effect on we do things

19
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:01,859
they're giving us these capabilities

20
00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:03,960
that we can basically turn into new

21
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:06,689
opportunities so for example get comes

22
00:01:06,689 --> 00:01:09,420
out in 2005 and then three years later

23
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:12,320
we get github and it's this

24
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,460
transformation that I actually believe

25
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:16,920
is revolutionary our tools are

26
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:19,770
transforming our behaviors and to quote

27
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:22,590
Clay Shirky revolutions don't happen

28
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:24,810
when society adopts new technologies

29
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:27,500
they happen when we adopt new behaviors

30
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:29,700
so what are these new behaviors that

31
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:34,829
we've adopted first let's make sure that

32
00:01:34,829 --> 00:01:37,259
we're on the same page about what I mean

33
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:39,540
with the behavior and how behaviors come

34
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:42,180
to be so a behavior is the product of

35
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:46,680
three factors and this is fogs behavior

36
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,020
model he studies persuasive technology

37
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:53,040
at Stanford and in this model he states

38
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,860
that in order for a behavior to occur

39
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:58,100
you have to have sufficient motivation

40
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:01,079
sufficient ability and you have to be

41
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:04,079
triggered so motivation is pretty much

42
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:05,969
the worst thing should never rely on

43
00:02:05,969 --> 00:02:07,829
motivation for trying to get someone to

44
00:02:07,829 --> 00:02:09,720
change their behavior we all know how

45
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,700
well New Year's resolutions go you're

46
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,650
really motivated couple days later

47
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:17,040
are not so great ability as you can see

48
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,750
here can really be thought of as a

49
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:22,140
factor of how easy something is to do so

50
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:25,560
the more the easier it is the more able

51
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:30,150
one is and lastly trigger so dr. fog

52
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,590
actually really believes that we should

53
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:34,049
focus on triggers and simple triggers

54
00:02:34,049 --> 00:02:37,349
will help us create habits and habits

55
00:02:37,349 --> 00:02:40,709
are nothing more than automatic

56
00:02:40,709 --> 00:02:43,620
behaviors so now we're going to walk

57
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:46,260
through and see how our tools basically

58
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:48,599
got us to change our behavior and they

59
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:51,090
did two things first we had to adopt the

60
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:53,400
tool which is a behavior change and then

61
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,790
as a consequence of adopting that tool

62
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:58,200
we gained some new behaviors and I'm

63
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:01,920
going to walk you through this so to

64
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,900
understand how this came to be we need

65
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:05,220
to back up a little bit and we need to

66
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:08,280
go back to the mid-aughts and there is a

67
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,920
lot happening in development and around

68
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:14,280
2004 we had the release of the rails and

69
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:17,489
Django frameworks 2005 we had get

70
00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:22,470
frameworks and we also had this slew of

71
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:24,239
JavaScript frameworks that were that

72
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:25,680
were coming up and they were really

73
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,889
aimed at helping developers address the

74
00:03:28,889 --> 00:03:31,530
inconsistencies across browsers because

75
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:36,030
it was a nightmare and so jQuery comes

76
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:40,290
out in 2006 and it wasn't the first

77
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:44,150
framework but it was the only one that

78
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:47,310
took into consideration three factors

79
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:52,199
that allowed it to succeed first jquery

80
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:54,150
itself was a simple solution to the

81
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:57,299
problem the code was really simple it

82
00:03:57,299 --> 00:03:59,099
address one thing and it did it really

83
00:03:59,099 --> 00:04:00,959
well and that was letting us this deal

84
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:03,870
with dom manipulation second from the

85
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:07,260
get-go jquery released with really good

86
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:10,139
documentation so prototype actually had

87
00:04:10,139 --> 00:04:12,870
pretty much been adopted into rails by

88
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:14,909
that point and it kind of was the the

89
00:04:14,909 --> 00:04:16,709
main one but it didn't have

90
00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:19,709
documentation in fact it was like after

91
00:04:19,709 --> 00:04:22,139
a year before it actually released

92
00:04:22,139 --> 00:04:25,830
documentation and the last one that I

93
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:27,450
think is incredibly important

94
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:30,450
is John really understood the value of

95
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:32,640
community and so from the get-go he

96
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:35,100
issued this invitation to participate in

97
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:39,030
to collaborate and it took off the

98
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:42,050
second day someone released a plug-in

99
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:46,890
and this was this was incredible for us

100
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:49,770
I mean prior it was very difficult for

101
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:52,350
us to contribute back to JavaScript

102
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:53,580
interview back to our front-end

103
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:55,380
languages in fact it's sort of

104
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:58,350
JavaScript tumultuous the history that

105
00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:00,570
got us into this browser war place in

106
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:04,560
the first place so really what jQuery

107
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,050
did is it created this environment where

108
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:09,000
people could get things done without any

109
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,760
barriers it made it incredibly simple to

110
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:14,160
get started and allowed anyone with

111
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,850
sufficient motivation to contribute and

112
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:23,490
it's a success arguably jQuery is the

113
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:26,370
number one framework and use on the web

114
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:30,540
to date but beyond its fame for me it's

115
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:34,440
these three simple design decisions that

116
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:37,350
have started to affect other languages

117
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:39,720
to date and I've really led to the rise

118
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:43,350
of like no Jas and our newer frameworks

119
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:45,900
and our new ways of doing things so

120
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:49,860
jQuery paved the road and set an example

121
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:54,090
of what to do and collaboration really

122
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:56,940
cannot be underestimated it means the

123
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:59,580
prospect for new ideas that can make our

124
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:03,810
tools better so because we're so steeped

125
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:06,420
in this culture it can be really hard to

126
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:09,630
forget that collaboration in front end

127
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:14,760
is a new thing it and for CSS this

128
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:18,240
ability is actually even more recent so

129
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,650
let's go back we're going to still stay

130
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:21,960
in about two thousand seven or CSS was

131
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:26,790
just a giant nightmare and around that

132
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:29,760
time we had decided that 960 pixels was

133
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,920
like the best way and the only way that

134
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:35,760
we should design we also had a bunch of

135
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:38,840
IE things to deal with

136
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:42,260
and while we had css3 and we were really

137
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:45,110
excited to stop all these hacky ways of

138
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:47,720
having to create border radius or like

139
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:51,020
load our our HTML with a ton of images

140
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:53,210
just for gradients all it did was

141
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:57,139
introduce a bunch of complexities and it

142
00:06:57,139 --> 00:07:00,100
really just made us incredibly desperate

143
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:04,990
for a solution so and then additionally

144
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:08,169
this thing was about to come out and

145
00:07:08,169 --> 00:07:12,110
completely flip how we thought of web

146
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:13,639
development and take our standards and

147
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:16,700
just turn them upside down so we were

148
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:19,100
clamoring for a way to deal with this

149
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:22,580
problem and really I see the rise of CSS

150
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:27,050
preprocessors as almost inevitable in a

151
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:31,250
way because CSS was so difficult we had

152
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:33,410
high motivation and were motivated

153
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:35,450
enough that we were going to seek out a

154
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:39,110
solution so much like what was happening

155
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:41,500
in JavaScript we had all these different

156
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:45,110
options but it really came down to two

157
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:50,200
these two and how did that come to be

158
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:56,599
first I've been much the same way as as

159
00:07:56,599 --> 00:07:58,190
what happened in in the JavaScript

160
00:07:58,190 --> 00:08:01,130
community sass and less did a really

161
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:02,419
good job at addressing the

162
00:08:02,419 --> 00:08:05,510
inconsistencies less actually remained a

163
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:08,840
really powerful contender because it was

164
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:11,300
a lot easier to use and it gave us that

165
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:14,060
same power without the hurdles of having

166
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:16,910
to deal with like an indented syntax and

167
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:19,010
setting up Ruby and all these other

168
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:20,990
complications when all we wanted to do

169
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:24,280
with style and make our sites beautiful

170
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:27,229
granted the adoption in Twitter

171
00:08:27,229 --> 00:08:29,750
bootstrap didn't help but I actually

172
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:31,490
think that now that Twitter bootstrap

173
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:34,070
has released an official passport we're

174
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:36,320
going to see much more focus on that and

175
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:41,330
less on left and before I go on I do

176
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:44,839
want to thank less for one thing if it

177
00:08:44,839 --> 00:08:47,480
wasn't for less I don't believe that

178
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:49,520
sass would have would have adopted the S

179
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:52,250
CSS syntax as quickly as possible

180
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:55,430
and so the designers of SAS were really

181
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:58,190
aware that hey you know what by doing

182
00:08:58,190 --> 00:08:59,990
this we're going to make it a lot easier

183
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:02,180
to get people to change their behavior

184
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:04,810
and to get people to adopt staff so

185
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:08,690
that's what they did but there was one

186
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:12,550
other major turning point that really

187
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:17,780
allowed SAS to edge out less and that

188
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:21,770
was compass compass was kind of like the

189
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:25,940
jQuery for SAS and in fact compass

190
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:28,820
really abided by the same three design

191
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:31,280
decisions that allowed jQuery to stake

192
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:34,190
its hold in front-end development SAS

193
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:36,770
was pluggable at first by design but we

194
00:09:36,770 --> 00:09:38,450
weren't really sure what to do with it

195
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:41,720
so Chris releases compass and shows us

196
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:42,950
what we can do with these new

197
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:47,300
capabilities it's simple it's at this

198
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:48,920
get-go the most popular thing was

199
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,930
probably the css3 mixin so that we

200
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:52,490
didn't have to write all those crappy

201
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:55,120
border radiuses and vendor prefixes

202
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,680
second it had really good documentation

203
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,570
you could actually learn how these

204
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:00,980
mix-ins and these things were created

205
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:03,800
which helped you create new ones and

206
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:09,200
third Chris also issued a a call for

207
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,420
community and you could create your own

208
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:14,180
compass extensions and we learned how to

209
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:17,200
make Ruby gems and we release them why

210
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,550
because we really really really really

211
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:23,420
wanted to and to date there are over a

212
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:27,080
hundred and forty-two compass and SAS

213
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,940
extensions and it's growing those are

214
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:31,010
just the people that have registered so

215
00:10:31,010 --> 00:10:35,690
we can see that we really wanted really

216
00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:36,800
we're looking forward to this and we're

217
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,290
happy to share when that opportunity was

218
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:43,070
presented so our front-end tools are

219
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:45,500
really lowering the threshold for

220
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:49,040
finding good ideas as a result these

221
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,620
good ideas are getting incorporated back

222
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:55,070
into the parent language so you can see

223
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:57,950
CSS borrowing variable taking variables

224
00:10:57,950 --> 00:10:59,810
and some of the things that the newer

225
00:10:59,810 --> 00:11:02,660
stuff from SAS and also on JavaScript

226
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:03,800
the influence

227
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,690
of coffee script is really guiding the

228
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:09,250
newer decisions for the tc39 team and

229
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:13,040
harmony but what's really amazing is

230
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:17,930
that we are now empowered to do this

231
00:11:17,930 --> 00:11:20,839
ourselves without having to rely on

232
00:11:20,839 --> 00:11:23,720
these institutions I mean they're a

233
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,640
little slow moving and I know they have

234
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:28,519
rules in place but if we had waited for

235
00:11:28,519 --> 00:11:30,320
them can you imagine where we'd be right

236
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:38,630
now not fun so our tools have triggered

237
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:41,750
this participatory cultural revolution

238
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:44,570
but really changing how we are able to

239
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:46,670
work together and to work around

240
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:49,730
obstacles and barriers it's really a

241
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:52,490
fundamental new way of thinking about

242
00:11:52,490 --> 00:11:55,790
innovation it's bottom up it's

243
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:58,730
participatory its democratic it's a

244
00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:01,399
little crazy and all these are great

245
00:12:01,399 --> 00:12:05,540
phase our tools have enabled groups and

246
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:08,390
individuals to try radical things by

247
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:11,540
removing any barriers we've created

248
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:13,970
environments who people want to get

249
00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:17,360
things done and they can and not only

250
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,660
that our environments are encouraging

251
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:23,360
and supportive and they're nurturing our

252
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:28,459
creativity and individuality these are

253
00:12:28,459 --> 00:12:30,880
the necessary ingredients for change

254
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:34,970
collective participation plus collective

255
00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:36,750
action

256
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:39,930
our ability to learn and work is growing

257
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:43,380
stronger and stronger in a relatively

258
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:46,560
short span of time we have completely

259
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:50,460
changed how we do things I mean we

260
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:52,620
wouldn't really dream of approaching a

261
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:54,840
project without any one of these new

262
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:59,950
tools so

263
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:03,040
what's the point of all of this right at

264
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:06,280
a certain point we're kind of like why

265
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:10,030
do we need so many things do we need yet

266
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:11,740
another build tool and yet another

267
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:13,660
static site generator and yet another

268
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:18,130
way to process or compile our CSS I mean

269
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:20,400
it may start to really seem redundant

270
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:24,070
but it's really not quite yet because

271
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:26,170
right now the best thing that we can do

272
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:29,830
is to continue to spur and encourage

273
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:32,770
this innovation our imagination or

274
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:36,160
creativity a lot of our life is sort of

275
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:39,730
spent focusing us down these paths and

276
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:42,460
the more that we can stay open and allow

277
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:44,620
ourselves to experiment the more new

278
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:49,510
ideas that we can keep generating so I

279
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:51,940
really predict that in the following

280
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:53,380
years we're going to start to see a

281
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:57,640
shift from technical problems to more

282
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:00,070
human problems it's going to be about

283
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:02,710
the human connection tech will be a part

284
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:05,020
of what we do but it's not going to be

285
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:07,000
that first solution that we should jump

286
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,140
to right so we really need to take care

287
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:13,780
right now to make sure that we are

288
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:16,570
building helpful welcoming communities

289
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:18,580
that are going to celebrate diversity

290
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:22,510
and difference let's continue to ensure

291
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:25,660
that we are open and supportive to

292
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:28,810
everyone no matter beliefs skill set

293
00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:32,860
skill level or discipline remember to be

294
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:36,030
kind and in the words of Chris Epstein

295
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:40,420
let's not firm form cliques

296
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:42,399
so what's incredibly wonderful and

297
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:43,870
encouraging to me and should be to

298
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:45,459
everyone is that we are actually

299
00:14:45,459 --> 00:14:49,570
succeeding look at us here today the

300
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:51,639
organizers of this conference value

301
00:14:51,639 --> 00:14:54,070
community value diversity and they and

302
00:14:54,070 --> 00:14:58,620
they put that first and it's incredible

303
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:01,180
the second thing that I also found

304
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:02,800
really interesting that we might not

305
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:06,279
know is that at the same time that we've

306
00:15:06,279 --> 00:15:08,560
been changing our behaviors we've

307
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,449
actually done so in a way that's

308
00:15:10,449 --> 00:15:15,279
designed for resilience so this is a

309
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:20,410
small world network and what it how it

310
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:21,940
works is that you have these tightly

311
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:24,940
small connected groups that then have

312
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:27,550
loose connections to a larger group so

313
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:29,170
here like this would be kind of our

314
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:31,149
larger group and within this I'm sure we

315
00:15:31,149 --> 00:15:32,949
have like tightly smaller groups like

316
00:15:32,949 --> 00:15:35,740
see some of my SAS people over there and

317
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:39,070
I'm sure there's no dl and every but and

318
00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:41,940
despite that we have these tiny little

319
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:44,860
close connections and then we can branch

320
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:48,130
out and so small world networks are

321
00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:52,240
actually incredibly advantageous they

322
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:55,420
first are resistant to damage which

323
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:58,660
makes us really strong and second they

324
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:01,600
transmit information really well we act

325
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:06,970
both as amplifiers and filters

326
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:09,980
so given that we are so skilled at

327
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:13,639
creating such a resilient network that

328
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:16,100
is based on valuing contributions and

329
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:18,199
the uniqueness of every community member

330
00:16:18,199 --> 00:16:20,720
and the fact that we can do this in such

331
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,930
a short amount of time I really believe

332
00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:25,720
that we have a lot to contribute back to

333
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:30,339
society beyond just beautiful websites

334
00:16:30,339 --> 00:16:33,199
so citizens the world over are calling

335
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:36,980
for a change and I really believe along

336
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:39,139
with many others that this change is

337
00:16:39,139 --> 00:16:41,300
only going to come to a participatory

338
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:44,329
revolution we're the same design

339
00:16:44,329 --> 00:16:47,089
decisions that made our tools so great

340
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:50,089
and allowed them to succeed are applied

341
00:16:50,089 --> 00:16:53,079
to other systems like urban planning and

342
00:16:53,079 --> 00:16:58,180
education so we developers and designers

343
00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:01,310
have an immensely valuable perspective

344
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:04,130
to share beyond just our tech

345
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:07,850
communities we are successful practicing

346
00:17:07,850 --> 00:17:12,049
models of participatory culture I mean

347
00:17:12,049 --> 00:17:14,540
we're more than just you I developers in

348
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:17,480
my mind we are leaders of one of the

349
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:22,040
largest movements in the world so being

350
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,839
a front-end developer means to hold this

351
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:27,169
immense power in your hand write code

352
00:17:27,169 --> 00:17:29,299
literacy suddenly becomes more than just

353
00:17:29,299 --> 00:17:33,049
a job or career change it's the ability

354
00:17:33,049 --> 00:17:36,200
to contribute to this large human

355
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:38,850
network

356
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:41,410
so what

357
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:44,440
decide what we want to do with our new

358
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:47,290
capabilities what opportunities do we

359
00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:49,810
want to create where do we want to

360
00:17:49,810 --> 00:17:53,470
create these opportunities be it here

361
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:56,410
for our front-end communities or back

362
00:17:56,410 --> 00:18:00,850
home for your neighborhoods remember

363
00:18:00,850 --> 00:18:07,420
we're doing something right already so

364
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:11,410
as you create an experiment remember to

365
00:18:11,410 --> 00:18:14,710
encourage and reward participation along

366
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:17,880
every step of the way don't worry

367
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:21,970
doesn't have to be a big thing make

368
00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:27,010
up right now thank you Eric Suzanne and

369
00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:29,290
if we can get he's right over there by

370
00:18:29,290 --> 00:18:34,270
