1
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:20,200

you

2
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:22,170
as we go mentioned I'm going to talk a

3
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:23,730
little bit today about how how we

4
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:26,820
interact with the web is changing I'm

5
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:28,110
going to do that just there's just a

6
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:29,040
start out I'm gonna start out with a

7
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:31,950
super mr. obvious slide and that is that

8
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:36,030
web mobile browsing is exploding the

9
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:38,250
interesting point though is that this

10
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:39,960
year there are more people browsing the

11
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:41,670
web with touch than there are we using

12
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:45,269
mouse and the other implication that may

13
00:00:45,269 --> 00:00:47,070
not be really apparent is that people

14
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:49,559
are starting to use are using touch on

15
00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:52,860
desktop as well so windows 8 now has

16
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:56,969
touch built-in and even you know

17
00:00:56,969 --> 00:00:58,620
platforms like I'm going to have have

18
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:00,780
touched integrated into the platform and

19
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:02,670
so if you have a touch capable laptop

20
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:04,379
you can start using the web on your

21
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:06,240
desktop as well with touch and so this

22
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,950
curve I expect or the number of people

23
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:09,330
using the curve the implication of this

24
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:11,789
curve is that a number of people using

25
00:01:11,789 --> 00:01:13,080
touch on the web is only going to

26
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:17,070
accelerate and so we did a lot of

27
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:18,990
research and what just really this talk

28
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:21,330
is about is the first part is a little

29
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:22,470
bit about the research we did with

30
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:23,670
surface and the second part is about

31
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:26,880
pointer events but but as part of doing

32
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,680
the the building the surface device we

33
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,000
did a lot of research and what was going

34
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,580
on on the web and I keep hoback you can

35
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:34,350
delete this slide because i think it's i

36
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:36,299
think probably for most people's is a

37
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:38,070
pretty elite audience this is pretty

38
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:39,570
obvious but there's things that stop

39
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:42,000
working when you win when you are using

40
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,700
the web in a touchable manner right so

41
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:47,549
when you hover is a terrible thing to

42
00:01:47,549 --> 00:01:50,009
use and you have a touchable web it note

43
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:51,899
upstart not hover but hover hover menus

44
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:53,820
and things like that where the

45
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:55,350
interaction requires that you're able to

46
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:57,450
hover over a device or over an element

47
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:00,689
on the page when you're using you're

48
00:02:00,689 --> 00:02:02,670
using the web page in a touch manner

49
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:04,710
that's impossible so some patterns like

50
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:06,930
this stop working and you need to think

51
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:09,149
about that which can sometimes be

52
00:02:09,149 --> 00:02:10,739
challenging when you develop doing most

53
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:12,930
your goal and obviously on a laptop so

54
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:14,489
you need to reconsider which message are

55
00:02:14,489 --> 00:02:16,350
using on the web as you develop for the

56
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:19,799
web for the touch another thing we did

57
00:02:19,799 --> 00:02:22,650
is we did a lot of research on what's

58
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:27,019
the optimal touch target size so we

59
00:02:27,019 --> 00:02:29,549
obviously a mouse has really fine

60
00:02:29,549 --> 00:02:31,230
grained control over you know clicking

61
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:33,120
elements on the screen and obviously

62
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:33,990
touch doesn't

63
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:36,510
people have fingers of various sizes and

64
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:39,000
what we discovered is that we did we

65
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,470
need research that there is there people

66
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:42,000
had fingers that went from eight

67
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,280
millimeters all the way up to 19

68
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,740
millimeters with 11 millimeter adder

69
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:50,130
average basically and what we found is

70
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:53,010
that we use different touch target sizes

71
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:58,440
and we found that as the touch sighs got

72
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:01,470
below five millimeters people started to

73
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:03,780
make a lot more mistakes so that seems

74
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:05,580
to be a kind of the asymptotic kind of

75
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:07,830
curve and which you know people start to

76
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:10,260
have a lot more trouble using using your

77
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:12,420
website and it's not only if they have

78
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:14,370
more trouble clicking the target they

79
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:16,920
actually spend more time trying to zero

80
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,600
in on the target as well so those two

81
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:21,150
things combined together to be you know

82
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:23,310
to make it very much more difficult and

83
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:24,870
so what we discovered in that research

84
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:26,490
is that something between seven

85
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:29,130
millimeters and nine millimeters is kind

86
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:31,260
of an ideal touch target size and so

87
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:33,810
that's what that implies kind of depends

88
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:35,660
on the the density of the screen but

89
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:37,980
from a lot of the common screens right

90
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:39,900
now that's 40 to 50 pixels your touch

91
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:42,780
target should be in that range going

92
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:44,610
above that obviously is easier to touch

93
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:46,590
but then you start using up more screen

94
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:49,560
real estate for your touch targets so as

95
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,850
you design your applications you should

96
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:52,890
think about you know people using it for

97
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:54,210
touching that and making sure that touch

98
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:57,390
targets are the right size another part

99
00:03:57,390 --> 00:03:58,440
that we did that not a part of the

100
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,940
researchers did with the surface was

101
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:01,680
looking at where tarts targets are

102
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,200
positioned and so those of you that are

103
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,450
have seen Windows and Windows 8 we have

104
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:09,300
this this this kind of this pattern

105
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:10,680
where we have things on the left and the

106
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,450
right that you can you can click and

107
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:14,460
this comes directly out of the research

108
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:17,010
on one where people's hands are and so

109
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:19,500
the green regions here are where it's

110
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,570
easy for people with with the smallest

111
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:23,760
hands to reach touch targets and as you

112
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,350
see it's kind of all run the it's in the

113
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:29,040
middle of the tablet it's did you know

114
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,000
obviously to the right and the left

115
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,690
usually and so for the touch targets

116
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:35,670
that you wanted your users to use the

117
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:37,620
most these are the best positions for

118
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:43,260
that you should you should have and you

119
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:45,479
know as things get more to the senator

120
00:04:45,479 --> 00:04:46,800
to screen a big more difficult for

121
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,050
people to use and so when people at

122
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:50,310
Microsoft are thinking about building

123
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:51,840
building websites and building

124
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,300
applications we have this general kind

125
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:56,340
of set of guidelines and so the first

126
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:57,629
one kind of comes out of the last one

127
00:04:57,629 --> 00:04:59,090
put your touch targets to the side

128
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:01,229
towards the middle if possible if it's a

129
00:05:01,229 --> 00:05:05,009
static screen or doesn't scroll and on

130
00:05:05,009 --> 00:05:06,930
the on the phone it's exactly the

131
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:08,099
opposite right so you're using your

132
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:11,069
thumb as opposed to fingers it's it's

133
00:05:11,069 --> 00:05:13,110
the best interaction zone is actually in

134
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:15,449
the middle and so then you kind of flip

135
00:05:15,449 --> 00:05:16,650
that around when you start thinking

136
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:18,060
about where the best areas are for

137
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:21,180
people to read things on on mobile

138
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:23,219
devices for the tablet it's it's it's

139
00:05:23,219 --> 00:05:25,620
best up top their hands aren't obscuring

140
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:27,629
it they can you know that it's easier

141
00:05:27,629 --> 00:05:29,129
from the read and the same thing on on

142
00:05:29,129 --> 00:05:33,900
the phone as well and so you know people

143
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:36,599
bring expectations now you know the

144
00:05:36,599 --> 00:05:39,810
explosion of apps in mobile and desktop

145
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:42,719
has brought expectations of what the you

146
00:05:42,719 --> 00:05:44,819
know touch touchable apps mean to the

147
00:05:44,819 --> 00:05:46,770
web as well and one thing that the web

148
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:49,379
really hasn't you know to date hasn't

149
00:05:49,379 --> 00:05:51,449
kept up with is multi-touch so the

150
00:05:51,449 --> 00:05:54,599
ability to have multiple pointer events

151
00:05:54,599 --> 00:05:57,270
going on at once and so this has led us

152
00:05:57,270 --> 00:06:00,389
in in in conjunction with Mozilla who's

153
00:06:00,389 --> 00:06:02,310
been a great partner in his proposal to

154
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:03,930
propose to the w3c something called

155
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:06,900
pointer events and what the idea of

156
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:09,270
pointer events is is to evolve the

157
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:12,539
current Mouse events model to unify this

158
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:14,990
across the other types of point of

159
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:17,310
pointers that are available so we're

160
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:18,779
talking about mice are talking about

161
00:06:18,779 --> 00:06:20,340
touch we're talking about pens and

162
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:21,990
things that we can't we don't even

163
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:27,569
haven't even dreamed up yet so this is

164
00:06:27,569 --> 00:06:29,460
moved is to move very quickly through

165
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:33,569
the w3c it was a working draft and I

166
00:06:33,569 --> 00:06:36,960
think March of this year I believe this

167
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,539
year and in five months it's been two

168
00:06:39,539 --> 00:06:42,389
candidate recommendation the good news

169
00:06:42,389 --> 00:06:44,669
is it's really an elbow volution so

170
00:06:44,669 --> 00:06:46,590
we've taken what you already know from

171
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:49,650
mouse events and essentially have you

172
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:50,940
know there are more or less drop-in

173
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:52,650
replacements there's really only one

174
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:53,849
thing that we've added and that's

175
00:06:53,849 --> 00:06:56,580
pointer cancel pointer cancel is an

176
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:58,320
event you get when someone changes an

177
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,630
orientation

178
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:02,300
or or a couple other scenarios where you

179
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:04,580
want to or accidental input that has

180
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:06,830
been detected by the device where you

181
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:08,270
want to cancel the inputs you want to

182
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:09,790
cancel this particular pointer event

183
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:12,380
otherwise it's more or less which you

184
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:15,560
expect these events from from you know

185
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,890
using Mouse events for many many years

186
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:20,150
what it does add is it adds more

187
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:21,290
attributes so I'm going to walk through

188
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:23,210
each of these in a little bit more

189
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:26,330
detail so it adds more the set of

190
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:27,890
attributes that are available on each

191
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:30,560
each event so that you can you can do

192
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,450
some you know much more richer

193
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:34,910
interaction model of with with touch and

194
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:36,920
other other pointer devices and so the

195
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:39,560
first one is the first set is is width

196
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,690
and height and this is the recognition

197
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:44,330
that a lot of pointer events beyond the

198
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:46,610
mouse have our point of devices beyond

199
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:48,710
the mouse have a real physical world

200
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:50,630
width and height right so when you put

201
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:52,280
your finger down on the screen depending

202
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:54,050
on how much you you're pressing on if

203
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:55,580
you're using your thumb or your index

204
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:57,230
finger it's going to have a different

205
00:07:57,230 --> 00:07:59,360
geometry on the screen and so this

206
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,340
passes us through to your web app so you

207
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:03,080
have access to that and you can respond

208
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:07,160
appropriately you know likewise for some

209
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:10,400
devices and in particular the pen there

210
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,440
there you know it might be important to

211
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:16,420
have the pressure and a tilt that it's

212
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:19,340
that the deploying device is at this

213
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:20,690
allows you to do kind of stenographic

214
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:24,440
you know calligraphy style things with

215
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:27,110
the with the pen and so you can you can

216
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:29,270
reflect what the users real intention

217
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:34,820
was with using the device and finally

218
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:37,880
there's there's two other things you can

219
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:41,120
use so if you know most cases you

220
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,340
probably want to handle pointer devices

221
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:45,890
the same button you know in the case

222
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:47,300
that you don't you want to handle a pen

223
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:49,190
differently from a touch device or a

224
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:51,830
mouse you have the ability with pointer

225
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:55,790
type 2 to do device specific actions and

226
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:58,370
then finally because this now is a model

227
00:08:58,370 --> 00:08:59,810
where there can be multiple pointer

228
00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:02,240
devices in action at where and play it

229
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,820
once there's actually an ID which is

230
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:07,070
kind of the thread ID for that one that

231
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:09,540
one pointer event

232
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:11,639
sorry that one pointer device being used

233
00:09:11,639 --> 00:09:13,259
in the system so you can keep track and

234
00:09:13,259 --> 00:09:17,070
you can keep them separate as they as

235
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:19,529
you're using them alright so I'm going

236
00:09:19,529 --> 00:09:20,850
to jump out I'll jump in right now and

237
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:22,110
just show a little bit of code or how

238
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:25,500
this how this works and I'm going to

239
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:28,410
have to do that over here unfortunately

240
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:30,149
we have to do as little dance because my

241
00:09:30,149 --> 00:09:31,920
screen is not actually high enough

242
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,680
resolution to do a 1080 80 presentation

243
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:38,040
I'm just sort of annoying get a new

244
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:42,839
laptop when I get back anyway so so what

245
00:09:42,839 --> 00:09:43,889
I'm showing here is essentially i'm

246
00:09:43,889 --> 00:09:45,120
going to build a finger painting

247
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,690
application so i'm using a canvas i'm

248
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:49,680
essentially there's a little bit of

249
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:53,730
boilerplate down here because in ie10 we

250
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:55,860
had a vendor prefixed implementation of

251
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:57,660
this and now it's shifted over to the

252
00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:02,160
draft recommendation events but i've

253
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,569
been essentially in that canvas i'm

254
00:10:03,569 --> 00:10:05,790
adding a set of event listeners so

255
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:07,440
there's a event listener for pointer

256
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,610
down and there's an event listener

257
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:11,790
pointer move and up and cancel and so on

258
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:13,949
and so what I'm going to do is I'm just

259
00:10:13,949 --> 00:10:15,959
going to when there's a pointer down i'm

260
00:10:15,959 --> 00:10:17,970
going to start paint and just to

261
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:20,040
initialize things I just have a list of

262
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:22,019
four points and so what I'm going to do

263
00:10:22,019 --> 00:10:25,079
is as I move I'm going to paint along

264
00:10:25,079 --> 00:10:27,120
that path so I just do a busy a curve

265
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,910
between those four points and we'll just

266
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:32,839
continue to do that as the user moves

267
00:10:32,839 --> 00:10:37,319
and when I lift the when I lift or

268
00:10:37,319 --> 00:10:39,000
cancel meeting an orientation change

269
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,610
usually I'll end the paint and it'll

270
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:44,310
stop the it clears this list essentially

271
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:47,970
and so if we look at you know how does

272
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:49,139
that how does that look how does that

273
00:10:49,139 --> 00:10:59,860
work and I need to go off full screen

274
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:02,070
wait so I have to this is really

275
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:03,270
annoying but I have to come over here

276
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:04,800
actually do that no I can I can do with

277
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,410
the so i'll do the so i'll start out

278
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:08,730
with just the mouse so this is one

279
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:11,430
pointer event right now i'm going to do

280
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:12,630
this little dance over here and use my

281
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:14,400
touch screen on my laptop which is

282
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:17,280
really annoying but to do the same thing

283
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:19,440
so i just touched my laptop it's not

284
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,720
really a parent to you in this case but

285
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:22,950
essentially I drew on the screen as well

286
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:25,020
so we use two different prototypes they

287
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:26,460
reacted in a way that you know makes

288
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:28,320
sense it did you know essentially drew

289
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,210
the line followed the curve that we were

290
00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:32,910
talking about the problem is and I can't

291
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:34,620
show this in real time is that if i use

292
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:37,920
both my fingers the way i've implemented

293
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:42,180
it it doesn't work right what happens is

294
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:44,250
it essentially jumps between the pointer

295
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:46,950
events in each of the the streams of

296
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:49,500
events were getting and so to fix that

297
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:50,970
essentially we just need to use the

298
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:53,700
pointer ID that i mentioned earlier so

299
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:55,620
with multi-touch essentially here's

300
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:58,950
another implementation of that and

301
00:11:58,950 --> 00:12:00,810
essentially i'm just using now instead

302
00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:02,460
of just having a single list i maintain

303
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:04,680
a list of points that we're going to

304
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,450
draw that curve between using you know

305
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:08,010
index by this pointer ID that you're

306
00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:09,870
getting as part of the as part of the

307
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:12,390
pointer event and otherwise it's the

308
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:13,740
same implementation we're drawing the

309
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:15,810
curve through that that that set of

310
00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:20,940
points and so if i go back and drag this

311
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:23,340
back over here and you have to trust me

312
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:25,980
that I'm using two fingers makes you can

313
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:28,320
tell now there's different colors now

314
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,650
that's handled correctly and actually

315
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:34,140
manage those as two separate streams of

316
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:37,740
points that it's drawing but you know

317
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:39,420
what cinching about this is is still the

318
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:41,340
same size right so even though i was

319
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:44,270
using a i have pretty big fingers

320
00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:47,070
globally big fingers and but it was

321
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:49,140
still kind of a you know a small kind of

322
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:50,940
you know pointer side or a mouse-sized

323
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:52,560
death thing and that's because i'm not

324
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,810
using the physical geometry of that

325
00:12:54,810 --> 00:12:58,740
particular pointer device and so looking

326
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:00,870
at this you know just one final tweak

327
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:02,160
i'm going i can make this is i can

328
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,680
actually hear i can just say you know i

329
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:06,480
just use some sort of heuristic right

330
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,070
add the width and the height of the

331
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:08,740
pointer to buy

332
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:10,870
and multiply enzyme 3 or use the

333
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:12,760
pressure or just you know use some kind

334
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:15,339
of default and doing that it allows us

335
00:13:15,339 --> 00:13:19,330
to have a real world you know have some

336
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:20,800
real-world element to it so on the mouse

337
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,060
you still get the kind of the narrow

338
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:29,050
line but if I if I use my finger my

339
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:31,149
giant my giant thumb in this case you

340
00:13:31,149 --> 00:13:32,860
know we get a giant line that looks you

341
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:35,410
know appropriately matches my giant

342
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:38,380
thumb so so that's just a quick example

343
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:41,950
so all of that is up on you know it when

344
00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:43,540
you jump into using pointer events all

345
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:46,990
of that is up on github jump back to

346
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:50,860
presentation so I I have that those

347
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:53,110
three examples run on github if you want

348
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:56,260
to have a look at them and you know in

349
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:58,899
terms of getting started so I eat n had

350
00:13:58,899 --> 00:14:00,850
vendor prefix support that I I talked

351
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:03,520
about briefly I 11 now is the UNPROFOR

352
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:05,130
it based on the draft recommendation

353
00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:08,200
there's a chromium WebKit prototype at

354
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:11,589
this the shortened URL but for most of

355
00:14:11,589 --> 00:14:12,640
us were probably you know for the

356
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:13,870
immediate future we're going to need to

357
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:17,070
use use polyfills so there's two

358
00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:19,540
polieville is available ones written by

359
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:23,380
a microsoft ER hann j/s it's available

360
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:25,540
there and then google a googler has

361
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:27,520
actually written a polyfill as well

362
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:32,170
called point cas so you get started

363
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:34,060
today those work roughly obviously

364
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:35,529
without native support there there's

365
00:14:35,529 --> 00:14:37,120
there's some approximation to exert

366
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,890
their interpreting Mouse events in order

367
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:41,620
to kind of build up same model but you

368
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:43,209
know to to a first approximation they

369
00:14:43,209 --> 00:14:45,700
work pretty well and if it is supported

370
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:47,200
natively on the platform it uses that

371
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:50,620
and both those polyfills so that's what

372
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:52,540
I had I'd love you know I'm happy to

373
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:53,770
take any questions about pointer events

374
00:14:53,770 --> 00:14:56,079
and yeah thanks for listening to me

375
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:59,880
again

376
00:14:59,890 --> 00:15:02,300
does anyone have any questions for Tim

377
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:12,890
oh we have one question over here so did

378
00:15:12,890 --> 00:15:14,780
you say these new events i'll go and

379
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:17,810
become part of the specification yeah so

380
00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:19,370
the day they're there a draft

381
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:23,240
recommendation in in the w3c someone

382
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,620
could someone else could probably answer

383
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:26,330
better what that exactly means what it

384
00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:29,150
at that point it's usually my

385
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:30,380
understanding is that means that it's

386
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:32,090
something that that people are going to

387
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:34,250
implement and so the for instance in the

388
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:35,630
blink project there's an intention to

389
00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:36,940
implement I think that's the right term

390
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:39,200
so it should be should be landing in

391
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:41,540
chrome obviously Mozilla co-sponsor

392
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:44,330
torko proposed it with us so i expect it

393
00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:46,730
lands and firefox at some near future

394
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:50,420
okay and will these work existing with

395
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:52,760
touch start in those ones as well and

396
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:55,220
i'm sorry the one um will they work

397
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:57,380
alongside the touch start touch end and

398
00:15:57,380 --> 00:15:59,600
all those it oh yeah yeah yeah it's

399
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:03,800
pretty terrible parallel yep cool okay

400
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:06,050
anyone else with questions more yeah in

401
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:11,900
the back we have one

402
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:15,070
are there aren't there any proposals for

403
00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:18,460
natively supporting multi-touch events

404
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:23,350
like inch and you know drag stuff like

405
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:26,080
that so that so gestures are not in the

406
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,610
spec that was that was that was

407
00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:28,990
something that they talked about but

408
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:30,279
didn't didn't make it into this into

409
00:16:30,279 --> 00:16:31,930
this particular spec I think that was

410
00:16:31,930 --> 00:16:33,730
that that's a question they were not

411
00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:35,279
gestures are gonna be part of the

412
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:37,930
pointer events but there's no there's no

413
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:40,980
default there's no pinch it or or or

414
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:43,779
kind of higher level gestures just just

415
00:16:43,779 --> 00:16:45,460
the raw events that you get back that

416
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:46,420
was something that was discussed during

417
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:48,130
the standardization positive we didn't
