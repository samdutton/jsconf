1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,140

I'll tell my camera I could my fingers

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:17,310
away I'm tinghu and I'm the crater of a

3
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:20,820
project called Elton s.l tennis is a CLI

4
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:23,699
tool for solving complex translation

5
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:27,060
workflow and complex formatting which is

6
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:30,840
mostly what my talk will be about let's

7
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:32,640
go through the structure of this talk i

8
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,010
will have demos of problems and

9
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:38,340
solutions regarding i18n i think it's

10
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:40,920
important for people to understand the

11
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:42,420
problem before they see solution

12
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:45,750
especially in the eye 18 subject because

13
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:49,020
many developers tends to be naive and

14
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:51,660
think that i 18 n it's not a problem

15
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:55,469
when in fact it is and it's usually not

16
00:00:55,469 --> 00:00:58,440
until they see a demonstration of a

17
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,809
problem where they recognize a problem

18
00:01:00,809 --> 00:01:03,629
being a problem my presentation will be

19
00:01:03,629 --> 00:01:06,000
divided into two parts one part

20
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,130
explaining complex translation

21
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:11,130
formatting and the other part explaining

22
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:14,430
i ate in workflow and at the end of this

23
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:20,430
talk i will publish my tool to NPM so

24
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:22,470
let's begin with hot one complex

25
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:26,159
translation work formatting I will talk

26
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:28,380
about CLD are and I see us message

27
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:31,409
format pure formatting context-based

28
00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:33,630
formatting and number formatting and

29
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:38,369
date formatting so let's begin with

30
00:01:38,369 --> 00:01:42,090
pluralization what we see here is a very

31
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:44,729
common mistake people make when dealing

32
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:47,820
with plural is asia we have blocks of

33
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:50,880
code where the execution is dependent on

34
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:54,570
a locale so we have if locale equals e

35
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:59,610
HC n LC flick l equals en doc us and

36
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:01,619
then we have block to code inside those

37
00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:06,060
if statements and this is bad makes me

38
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:10,440
want to cry because we have local

39
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,160
dependent code blocks

40
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:16,150
and it's bad because the translator

41
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:18,760
needs to depend on a programmer to

42
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:21,790
translate anything and it's also bad

43
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:25,060
because a programmer it's no local

44
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:27,850
specific data which in the pluralization

45
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:31,270
case means you're remembering or

46
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:36,910
memorizing clear rules and remember

47
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:38,980
include our rules for one or two locals

48
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:42,280
might be fine but try to remember to our

49
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:44,800
rules for free more which is very hard

50
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,580
and having Luke out specific code box

51
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:53,560
just makes your code base much more

52
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:57,520
complex so how do we solve this problem

53
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:01,330
or how do we make people not crying over

54
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:05,470
their code base first time explaining

55
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:08,860
like what is still they are what does it

56
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:13,660
stand for and why is it useful seal the

57
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:15,490
R stands for a common local data

58
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:20,709
repository its data is used as a helper

59
00:03:20,709 --> 00:03:23,950
for localizing strings and it's maybe

60
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:26,050
the largest repost here in the world if

61
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:29,830
not only and it's used by Apple Google

62
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:34,959
IBM yahoo etc here's some example data

63
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:39,490
taken from CL dr and in first xml tag we

64
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:43,090
see plural rules and it defines a number

65
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:45,280
of languages and one of them is english

66
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,580
and inside the xmltype laura rules we

67
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:52,060
have other plural rule or plural forms

68
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:58,630
that is defined inside there so let's

69
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:01,420
move on to plural forms in spoken

70
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:04,060
English we just have to define plural

71
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:08,739
forms namely singular and plural the

72
00:04:08,739 --> 00:04:14,440
plural to singular is one and the pure

73
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:17,380
form of parole for plural is everything

74
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:22,180
but one but because we have languages

75
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:25,610
such as Arabic Arabic have

76
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:29,599
six pure forms so seal dr needs to

77
00:04:29,599 --> 00:04:32,930
define up to 6000 forms and they are

78
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:35,569
called did they are named secure for now

79
00:04:35,569 --> 00:04:41,640
and they are called 012 few many another

80
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:45,830
so try to remember it 012 few many

81
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:48,620
another because it will be most likely

82
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:51,199
be used in any future i ate an end

83
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:55,189
library out there why is that Sylvia CL

84
00:04:55,189 --> 00:04:58,039
DRS plural form is becoming de facto

85
00:04:58,039 --> 00:05:02,900
standard to use and its use already by

86
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:06,319
the iOS SDK and Android escape that

87
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:08,870
means iOS developers and Android

88
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:11,240
developers needs to know this plural

89
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:15,349
forms 012 a few many another and I think

90
00:05:15,349 --> 00:05:18,620
so does you as the JavaScript or try to

91
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:23,180
remember 012 a few many another and the

92
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:26,229
plural form 012 does not necessarily

93
00:05:26,229 --> 00:05:31,610
correspond to the numbers 0 12 here is

94
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:34,430
some example of plural forms like for

95
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:36,889
English the seal dr defines the pure

96
00:05:36,889 --> 00:05:40,539
form one another for the arabic language

97
00:05:40,539 --> 00:05:45,409
CLD are defines 0 1 2 view many nada or

98
00:05:45,409 --> 00:05:48,620
chinese we just have other for french we

99
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:51,710
have one another and remember that the

100
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:54,610
plural form 0 1 2 does not necessarily

101
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:57,889
correspond to the numbers 0 1 2 & French

102
00:05:57,889 --> 00:06:00,319
is a good example of that where the

103
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:03,259
plural form 1 correspond to the numbers

104
00:06:03,259 --> 00:06:08,449
0 & 1 and not just one so that is still

105
00:06:08,449 --> 00:06:13,009
they are pure form let's move on to ICUs

106
00:06:13,009 --> 00:06:17,539
message format but before we move on to

107
00:06:17,539 --> 00:06:20,539
something more specific like I see you

108
00:06:20,539 --> 00:06:24,169
message format let's talk about message

109
00:06:24,169 --> 00:06:27,110
format in generally in JavaScript we do

110
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:29,839
message form up using two methods in

111
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:32,360
JavaScript we have string concatenation

112
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:36,589
and template strings and I think

113
00:06:36,589 --> 00:06:39,560
everyone is familiar with this

114
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:44,010
but this kind of message format is only

115
00:06:44,010 --> 00:06:46,889
used for like trivial things like string

116
00:06:46,889 --> 00:06:51,240
interpolation and it's not suitable for

117
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,520
something complex like pure formatting

118
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,940
and that is where I see use message

119
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:59,790
format comes in ICU stands for

120
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:02,669
international components for unicode and

121
00:07:02,669 --> 00:07:06,000
it's written in C++ and Java icu's

122
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,430
message format it's a component in nice

123
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:14,100
you for having message dreams and here's

124
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:17,580
an example of chloroform at the market

125
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:20,639
begins with curly bracket and ends with

126
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:23,490
the curly bracket and we pass in a

127
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:26,010
variable which is the counter and in

128
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:29,340
this example it's called likes the

129
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:30,840
second argument is the type of

130
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:33,120
formatting which is plural in the

131
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:37,050
pluralization case and in the third you

132
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:40,320
can see we need to define some some

133
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:43,919
messages it corresponds to each pure for

134
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:46,919
and for the English we need to define at

135
00:07:46,919 --> 00:07:49,200
least to some messages because there are

136
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:56,280
two plural forms one another but this

137
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,880
syntax looks a little bit complex and

138
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:01,560
very difficult to grasp at first time

139
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:05,630
and I will try to do to explain my best

140
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:10,169
that this syntax is near optimal because

141
00:08:10,169 --> 00:08:13,289
try to define a simpler syntax using at

142
00:08:13,289 --> 00:08:15,750
least one variable which is the counter

143
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:19,200
the type of formatting and then you need

144
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:22,700
some messages for each plural form I

145
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:25,560
need to think a little bit you will end

146
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:28,650
up something like this which is quite

147
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:34,400
what we wanted it's quite optimal also

148
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:38,940
and for arabic language we needed to

149
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:42,900
find some messages for 630 forms and not

150
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:47,339
just too so i'm going to do a live demo

151
00:08:47,339 --> 00:08:50,830
now

152
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:55,910
I'll open the editor of my choice and I

153
00:08:55,910 --> 00:09:00,890
got some code already ready here I'll

154
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:05,300
just hit save and then I need to run the

155
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:08,350
command it's called Elton s update I

156
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:13,390
will open the translation interface to

157
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:17,780
translate this I will explain the code

158
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:20,960
here we require some localization

159
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:24,710
strings and then we set set it to use

160
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:29,320
the locale en not use a and at us and

161
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:32,420
the L function call here is just a

162
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:35,810
localization string getter and then we

163
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:38,270
will output the message so it's very

164
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:45,290
simple ok so let's go to the translation

165
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:48,400
interface I will just go into the

166
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:53,090
translation i want to translate and it

167
00:09:53,090 --> 00:09:54,860
will begin with the sorting curly

168
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:56,510
bracket and ends with the curly bracket

169
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:59,380
while passing the variable likes and

170
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:01,910
then the type of formatting which is

171
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:06,020
plural and then i need to find a sub

172
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:08,720
message for each 30 for and the pure

173
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:16,640
form one and other and the string i

174
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:21,380
wanted to translate was I like explode

175
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:29,060
post so i will type in I like square

176
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:38,890
blog post and then square blog post i

177
00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:44,169
will just hit save

178
00:10:44,179 --> 00:10:48,389
go back to my terminal and then compile

179
00:10:48,389 --> 00:10:54,509
the translation with Elton s compile now

180
00:10:54,509 --> 00:10:56,910
I need to test if it works or not so

181
00:10:56,910 --> 00:11:00,119
we'll just run the example just know the

182
00:11:00,119 --> 00:11:04,259
index I like 10 blog post and it ends

183
00:11:04,259 --> 00:11:08,209
with the S so that worked I will try to

184
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:15,059
set out 10 likes we have just one I like

185
00:11:15,059 --> 00:11:19,399
one blog post so the pluralization works

186
00:11:19,399 --> 00:11:25,139
so let's go back to the presentation so

187
00:11:25,139 --> 00:11:28,349
there was chloroform out let's move on

188
00:11:28,349 --> 00:11:32,549
to select format the use case for select

189
00:11:32,549 --> 00:11:35,759
for mass is context-based formatting and

190
00:11:35,759 --> 00:11:41,249
what is that an example is X likes this

191
00:11:41,249 --> 00:11:44,459
conference where X is substituted with

192
00:11:44,459 --> 00:11:48,029
eec or day he likes this conference she

193
00:11:48,029 --> 00:11:50,609
likes this contrast or day likes this

194
00:11:50,609 --> 00:11:55,169
conference and this is how this syntax

195
00:11:55,169 --> 00:11:59,429
looks like for select format and it

196
00:11:59,429 --> 00:12:01,289
starts with the curly bracket and ends

197
00:12:01,289 --> 00:12:04,350
with the curly bracket we input a

198
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:07,429
variable and the second argument takes a

199
00:12:07,429 --> 00:12:10,559
select keyword for select format and

200
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:13,589
then we need to define some messages for

201
00:12:13,589 --> 00:12:18,689
each case and here's an example of

202
00:12:18,689 --> 00:12:21,989
gender context space formatting we

203
00:12:21,989 --> 00:12:25,199
passing the variable gender and then we

204
00:12:25,199 --> 00:12:28,289
define for the case male we define the

205
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:31,679
sub message p or the case female we

206
00:12:31,679 --> 00:12:34,859
define the sub message she and for all

207
00:12:34,859 --> 00:12:39,709
other just stay so that is select format

208
00:12:39,709 --> 00:12:44,729
let's move on to number format this is

209
00:12:44,729 --> 00:12:47,249
how I see you the pines number format

210
00:12:47,249 --> 00:12:49,619
it's quite familiar with the other

211
00:12:49,619 --> 00:12:53,939
formats or markup start with curly

212
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:56,590
brackets and then with curly brackets

213
00:12:56,590 --> 00:13:00,220
passing variable of type number and then

214
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:01,810
the second argument is the type of

215
00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:05,590
formatting which is number and the third

216
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:10,000
argument we have a couple of options in

217
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,530
the first example we have something

218
00:13:11,530 --> 00:13:14,710
called a decimal pattern and you can see

219
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:18,040
it's with squares and zeros there and I

220
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:21,070
want won't go into detail or how to

221
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:23,290
define your decimal pattern or how it

222
00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:25,240
works you can check out the dogs at the

223
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:28,240
Internet to see how it works but if you

224
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,770
don't want to define your decimal

225
00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:32,080
pattern you can just use some key words

226
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:35,320
like interior percent pramila to define

227
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:41,440
like into the format you want and before

228
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,900
I came here I was checking out our bin

229
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:46,060
beasts website to see if there was

230
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:49,630
something good at tuesdaya and I noticed

231
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:51,970
that their price tag if you look at the

232
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:55,270
symbol their currency symbol it's with

233
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:59,320
the super element and this is a perfect

234
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:01,420
use case for using decimal pattern

235
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:03,820
number format you wrap the currency

236
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:09,520
symbol its with an open four legs with

237
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,170
super element and then when we in

238
00:14:11,170 --> 00:14:13,570
compile it it will have that HTML

239
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:18,190
elements so that is number format let's

240
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:22,510
move on to date format this is how I see

241
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:26,230
you defiance date format and it's quite

242
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:30,070
familiar we have variable and date date

243
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:32,470
defines the type of formatting and the

244
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:36,060
further argument is just a date pattern

245
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:39,250
the date pattern is quite intuitive why

246
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:42,640
why is for years mmm is for mom didi

247
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:47,080
days and so on and I won't go into

248
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:50,680
detail because the date pattern have a

249
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:54,730
long specification so we can like do

250
00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:57,670
whatever date format you want it's very

251
00:14:57,670 --> 00:15:01,410
flexible let's move on to part two

252
00:15:01,410 --> 00:15:04,650
translation workflow I will talk about

253
00:15:04,650 --> 00:15:08,530
syncing translation keys translator and

254
00:15:08,530 --> 00:15:10,220
programmer workflow

255
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:15,710
and translation key naming in the left

256
00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:19,310
we have storage which in this example is

257
00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:23,240
a JSON file and in the right we have the

258
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:28,280
source code and in order for them to

259
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:31,460
work they must be synched the storage

260
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:34,400
must have the the translation keys that

261
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:37,490
the source code has if not they won't

262
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:43,840
work we usually do this sinking manually

263
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:47,630
and when we do it manually that means

264
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:49,580
when you delete the key in your source

265
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:52,550
you need to delete it from storage when

266
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:55,010
you add a key in your store source need

267
00:15:55,010 --> 00:15:57,890
to additives or storage when you change

268
00:15:57,890 --> 00:16:00,230
a key in your source you need to change

269
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:03,980
it in your storage and that's a hell I

270
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:09,890
mean just explaining it is Helen so most

271
00:16:09,890 --> 00:16:11,900
projects stay out of sync because of

272
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:19,370
that how can we fix it we can fix it

273
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:22,790
with something called auto sync what is

274
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:25,580
that so when you delete the key in your

275
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:27,740
source it will delete it from the

276
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:30,050
storage when you add a key in your

277
00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:32,320
source it will add it in your storage

278
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:35,330
when you change a key in your source it

279
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:41,000
will migrate to the new key but in order

280
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,100
for our thing to work we need some kind

281
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:46,370
of workflow and you already seen some

282
00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:48,680
part of it you write your source code

283
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:51,530
and then you update your translation

284
00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:54,290
keys you tell a translator to translate

285
00:16:54,290 --> 00:16:58,520
it or you can translate it yourself then

286
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:00,830
you compile your translation and then

287
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:02,300
you just run your application and you

288
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:06,140
are done so let's have a demo of auto

289
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:14,840
sync I will go back to sublime and I

290
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:20,439
will define a new message now

291
00:17:20,449 --> 00:17:32,130
and it's called demo auto-sync I will

292
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:37,590
demo the bad part first in this folder

293
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:41,610
we have the storage you can see this

294
00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:46,140
JSON files but this jason has just have

295
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:50,870
one entry for the key demo plural and

296
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:56,970
the index of KS is my source files we

297
00:17:56,970 --> 00:17:58,860
just have them accrual at the beginning

298
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:02,430
i just added them or sink but in order

299
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:05,670
for it to work a most ad demo or the

300
00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:09,810
sink in my storage and that means going

301
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:17,200
through each file and add it in here

302
00:18:17,210 --> 00:18:24,710
oops and then yeah type it manually and

303
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:28,110
go not just do it for one file but all

304
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:34,290
these files and that's a hell and but

305
00:18:34,290 --> 00:18:39,210
with Elton s you just wait we must hit

306
00:18:39,210 --> 00:18:45,960
save here first with Elton s we can just

307
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:49,080
run the command Elton s update and you

308
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:51,360
can see that it added the translation

309
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:55,110
key demo auto sync and we can check the

310
00:18:55,110 --> 00:19:08,840
storage to see if it's added there

311
00:19:08,850 --> 00:19:13,920
yeah you can see them all the sink here

312
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:17,880
instead HCM or you are you them out

313
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:22,140
seeing jjp have our demo auditing and

314
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:25,010
all of this file have the motors inc now

315
00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:27,600
but let's say that we want to remove

316
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:34,620
them or other thing remove it here then

317
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:37,620
if we did manually we need to remove

318
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:41,010
this entry in all of these storage files

319
00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:46,530
and that's a help what we tell 10s you

320
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:50,540
just do Elton s update and it will work

321
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:56,270
hopefully yeah so it removed that entry

322
00:19:56,270 --> 00:19:59,250
demo or sink it's not there just demo

323
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:02,640
clear all you can check all this power

324
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:07,310
there is no demo or think anymore and

325
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:12,330
finally to the migration part let's say

326
00:20:12,330 --> 00:20:14,820
you want to change this translation key

327
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:18,030
you don't think think it's a fit like I

328
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:20,010
want to change this translation key to

329
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:23,990
demo blue rolls with the next sat there

330
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:27,900
if you change this key then you need to

331
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:30,150
go through each of the storage files and

332
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:33,930
change it with ness at them you need to

333
00:20:33,930 --> 00:20:36,600
do it for all these files and that's

334
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:41,040
also a help but with Elton s you just

335
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:46,470
hit save and then L 10s update and it

336
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:50,490
will tell me the key demo role is now

337
00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:52,620
gone in source what do you want to do

338
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:56,550
with it we have two options migrate to

339
00:20:56,550 --> 00:21:00,480
the new or delete it and in this case we

340
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:08,910
want to migrate to the new one so back

341
00:21:08,910 --> 00:21:17,159
to the presentation

342
00:21:17,169 --> 00:21:21,769
so that was demo of auto sync let's talk

343
00:21:21,769 --> 00:21:26,459
about translator and programmer workflow

344
00:21:26,469 --> 00:21:29,269
try to always store the English

345
00:21:29,269 --> 00:21:32,139
translation when you do your development

346
00:21:32,139 --> 00:21:35,299
because then the translator can relate

347
00:21:35,299 --> 00:21:37,779
to the English translation all the time

348
00:21:37,779 --> 00:21:40,940
and let the translator learn about ICUs

349
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:43,519
message format because they will use in

350
00:21:43,519 --> 00:21:46,969
any future product project and it's very

351
00:21:46,969 --> 00:21:49,690
easy to learn eyes use message form and

352
00:21:49,690 --> 00:21:52,820
have a web translation interface

353
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:57,769
available for them at all time to ease

354
00:21:57,769 --> 00:22:00,619
your workflow let's talk about

355
00:22:00,619 --> 00:22:05,149
translation key naming don't use English

356
00:22:05,149 --> 00:22:08,749
text as translation keys because you

357
00:22:08,749 --> 00:22:11,389
will have namespace issues and not it's

358
00:22:11,389 --> 00:22:16,159
not future proof but I recommend instead

359
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:20,229
is defining a sort of content structure

360
00:22:20,229 --> 00:22:23,509
you can see we have a facebook as an

361
00:22:23,509 --> 00:22:26,929
example I just put the feed is in the

362
00:22:26,929 --> 00:22:29,809
center and then we have a side menu here

363
00:22:29,809 --> 00:22:34,219
and we namespace it with double

364
00:22:34,219 --> 00:22:37,279
underscore we need space feed and then

365
00:22:37,279 --> 00:22:40,969
the label name for side menu it's sign

366
00:22:40,969 --> 00:22:43,779
menu underscore and then the label name

367
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:49,129
this makes it more scalable status

368
00:22:49,129 --> 00:22:53,869
translation workflow so let's move on to

369
00:22:53,869 --> 00:23:04,560
the launch I'll just CD into the project

370
00:23:04,570 --> 00:23:17,210
and of type NPM publish and it will take

371
00:23:17,210 --> 00:23:23,389
a while let me just go through some

372
00:23:23,389 --> 00:23:24,960

ms any questions front again yes thanks

382
00:24:07,799 --> 00:24:10,169
for the talk I was wondering about if

383
00:24:10,169 --> 00:24:12,360
you could describe a bit the web

384
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:15,029
interface that you'd have people use for

385
00:24:15,029 --> 00:24:18,120
translation and also how that works with

386
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:21,899
auto sync okay and also possibly having

387
00:24:21,899 --> 00:24:25,110
multiple developers and or translators

388
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:28,260
working on the same code base yeah of

389
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:32,370
course so I will go to the translation

390
00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:35,610
interface just have a home button here

391
00:24:35,610 --> 00:24:43,020
and it will list in Chronicle order when

392
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:45,510
you run l 10 s update release the latest

393
00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:50,100
here so this is just having demo parole

394
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:52,890
but we fled more we listed in Chronicle

395
00:24:52,890 --> 00:25:00,750
order and you can search here I ok why

396
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:04,380
it's not working because I haven't put

397
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:12,290
it up

398
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:19,229
ok

399
00:25:19,239 --> 00:25:25,219
well if everyone can like if program are

400
00:25:25,219 --> 00:25:26,840
going to work with programmer on this

401
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:32,269
then you will just commit like if you're

402
00:25:32,269 --> 00:25:34,609
using it you just commit your transition

403
00:25:34,609 --> 00:25:37,279
in the storage and then just passed on

404
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:40,340
up and it will be good like if you have

405
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:43,070
a staging server and just run elton

406
00:25:43,070 --> 00:25:46,059
async based on that staging server and

407
00:25:46,059 --> 00:25:49,219
when you need someone need to translate

408
00:25:49,219 --> 00:25:51,379
something you just ask your translator

409
00:25:51,379 --> 00:25:53,899
to translate through the web interface

410
00:25:53,899 --> 00:25:57,679
in the staging server so that kind of

411
00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:01,159
workflow I think it's the best give a

412
00:26:01,159 --> 00:26:03,080
round of applause hang on thank you so
