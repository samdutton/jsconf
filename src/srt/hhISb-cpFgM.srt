00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:07,560

hello good morning everyone

2
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:10,050
I hope you're ready because my talk is

3
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:12,630
gonna be a really big change of context

4
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:16,859
as pace as well as content I'm gonna be

5
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:18,480
talking about a lot more technical stuff

6
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,970
there's gonna be a lot of code I'm

7
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:22,740
specifically going to talk about the

8
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:25,380
document side of SVG so over a lot over

9
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:26,789
the last three years I've been working a

10
00:00:26,789 --> 00:00:28,289
lot with SVG and I've been seeing a lot

11
00:00:28,289 --> 00:00:31,230
of developers use SVG a lot more than

12
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:32,790
they used to do before which is amazing

13
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:35,460
but I've been seeing them like they're

14
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:38,100
there's usually to focus on two specific

15
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:40,320
things and SVG either using them oh

16
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,540
there's a dog in here

17
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:46,140
use them using them either to display

18
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:48,360
small icons and illustrations or to

19
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,700
animate icons and illustrations or even

20
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:51,989
bigger stuff but usually either

21
00:00:51,989 --> 00:00:53,699
displaying simple static images or

22
00:00:53,699 --> 00:00:56,370
animating them but SVG because of its

23
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:58,140
nature as both an image format and the

24
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:00,090
document format it can do a lot more

25
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:02,730
than that and the document side of SVG

26
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:04,500
is not usually touched a lot I'm not

27
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,360
sure if it's because developers don't

28
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:09,180
know of what's possible with SVG or

29
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:11,040
maybe they haven't had the time to look

30
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,049
into it so I'm going to go over just

31
00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:14,610
some of the things that you can do with

32
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:17,040
SVG hopefully they will be able to

33
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,500
inspire you to do more actually did you

34
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,720
know that SVG is so powerful that and

35
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:24,990
dr. whose season 7 episode 2 missiles

36
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:28,400
are being guided by the power of SVG

37
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,200
that's pretty cool huh now seriously

38
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,509
though there is so much that you can do

39
00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:35,189
and I'm going to be only be gonna be

40
00:01:35,189 --> 00:01:37,350
covering like four or five things I'm

41
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:39,270
gonna be starting with cropping scaling

42
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:41,250
and preserving aspect ratio using using

43
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:43,200
SVG now in particular I'm gonna be

44
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,840
showing you how you can use SVG SVG can

45
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,450
be used to replace certain CSS features

46
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:49,680
when the browser support for those

47
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,390
features is not really that good now

48
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:53,340
this is not an SVG versus CSS thing

49
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:55,350
these two work fantastically together

50
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:57,119
but there are certain things that we can

51
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:58,920
do with with CSS that were actually

52
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,409
imported from SVG and browser support

53
00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:02,729
for those features is not really that

54
00:02:02,729 --> 00:02:05,009
good yet so in the meantime you can use

55
00:02:05,009 --> 00:02:07,049
SVG as long as you know about how those

56
00:02:07,049 --> 00:02:09,420
things work in SVG now when we talk

57
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:11,700
about cropping scaling and preserving

58
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,420
aspect ratio SVG there

59
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:15,130
two attributes in particular that we

60
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:17,530
usually talk about that they will do all

61
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:19,720
of this work for us the SVG view box

62
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,610
what I call or what I like to call the

63
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:24,700
SVG superpowers and the SVG preserve

64
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:26,800
aspect ratio attribute I like to call

65
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,270
the cousin of the view box or the best

66
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:29,410
friend because they do amazing things

67
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:32,470
together now these two are the most

68
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:36,580
powerful and possibly less or underused

69
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:39,160
attributes of SVG now before we get into

70
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,569
how these two work together and how

71
00:02:40,569 --> 00:02:41,440
we're going to use them

72
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,730
I want to go we need to be able to

73
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:44,980
differentiate between the SVG view box

74
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:47,350
and the SVG view port because there are

75
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:50,319
two different concepts now the sq2 view

76
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:52,299
port is the viewing area of the SVG you

77
00:02:52,299 --> 00:02:54,069
can think of it as a window through

78
00:02:54,069 --> 00:02:56,290
which you see an inset a certain scene

79
00:02:56,290 --> 00:02:58,510
just like a regular window this the

80
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:00,549
scene could be visible in its entirety

81
00:03:00,549 --> 00:03:03,310
or just partially within that window now

82
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:04,840
the size of that window every window has

83
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:07,180
a finite size the finite size of this

84
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:08,739
window is determined by the width and

85
00:03:08,739 --> 00:03:10,720
height attributes on the route SVG

86
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,330
element for example in this SVG here the

87
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:15,040
black borders in this example are the

88
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,840
borders of the SVG and they are defined

89
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,489
using the width and height attributes on

90
00:03:18,489 --> 00:03:21,160
the SVG element and they establish what

91
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:23,980
is known as the viewport of the SVG the

92
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:26,019
viewport is what the browser uses to

93
00:03:26,019 --> 00:03:27,970
determine how the SVG behaves in the

94
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:30,160
context of the page just like any other

95
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,810
HTML element that has a width and a

96
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:33,489
height the browser uses those dimensions

97
00:03:33,489 --> 00:03:35,320
in order to layout the entire page and

98
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:37,180
if you change the width and height of an

99
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:38,709
HTML element it's going to affect the

100
00:03:38,709 --> 00:03:39,790
entire layout and there's going to be

101
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:41,890
repainting and we layout this is the

102
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:43,600
kind of width and height that SVG also

103
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,640
has and just like HTML elements the

104
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:46,959
width and the height establish a

105
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:48,549
coordinate system on the SVG that

106
00:03:48,549 --> 00:03:50,260
coordinate system is called the initial

107
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:52,900
coordinate system but this coordinate

108
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,790
system is not what it may seem at first

109
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:56,470
so what you see here the cat inside of

110
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:59,530
the borders the browser does not use the

111
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:01,540
initial coordinate system of the SVG of

112
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:03,609
the viewport to draw the SVG on the

113
00:04:03,609 --> 00:04:07,690
canvas because conceptually the canvas

114
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:11,829
is infinite in both dimensions so just a

115
00:04:11,829 --> 00:04:13,660
quickly finishing the canvas is the

116
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:15,400
space or the area where the SVG content

117
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,320
is drawn conceptually it's infinite in

118
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:19,419
both dimensions however it is rendered

119
00:04:19,419 --> 00:04:20,799
on the screen relative to a finite

120
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:22,990
region known as the viewport our

121
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:24,280
rectangle

122
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:26,020
areas of the SVG that lie beyond the

123
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:27,670
boundaries of the viewport are clipped

124
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:29,770
off and not visible now I like to think

125
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:31,480
about SVG is in the sense as being

126
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:34,030
similar to Google Maps so you have this

127
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:35,680
small finite area just like an iframe

128
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,660
you see only part of that map but if you

129
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:39,250
drag that map around in the background

130
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:41,590
you can see a lot more so whenever I

131
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:43,090
think about SVG and I have to think

132
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:45,010
about viewport versus canvas I think

133
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:47,620
about it literally as two layers there's

134
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,720
the front layer just like a stencil with

135
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,400
a small rectangle and then there's the

136
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,169
back layer where all of my drawing is

137
00:04:53,169 --> 00:04:55,900
taking place now in order for the

138
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:57,370
browser to be able to draw on that

139
00:04:57,370 --> 00:04:59,260
infinite canvas that needs a coordinate

140
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:01,300
system and because it does not use the

141
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:03,310
coordinate system of the SVG width and

142
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:04,840
height it's going to need another

143
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:07,300
coordinate system so yes we have two

144
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:11,020
coordinate systems and SVG the

145
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:13,360
coordinate system created inside of the

146
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,430
SVG on the canvas is created using the

147
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:17,110
SVG view box that's what the view box is

148
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:18,970
for so we have the U port which is the

149
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:20,680
window width and height and we have the

150
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,360
view box which is the coordinate system

151
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:28,330
on the canvas the coordinate system on

152
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:30,100
the canvas has a different name so we

153
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:32,410
had initial initial chord in a system on

154
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:34,630
the viewport I still like there's I

155
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:36,010
think you're doing this for three years

156
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:37,990
and I still have to work viewport versus

157
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:39,400
view box initial coordinate system

158
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,229
versus the user coordinate system you're

159
00:05:41,229 --> 00:05:42,729
rarely going to be using those names

160
00:05:42,729 --> 00:05:44,710
anyway so it's usually viewport versus

161
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:47,200
view box now the viewport takes four

162
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,870
numerical numerical values the first

163
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:51,280
made up four values the first to

164
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,200
determine determine the coordinates of

165
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,479
the top left corner of the of the

166
00:05:55,479 --> 00:05:57,340
coordinate system so initially basically

167
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:58,720
where the coordinate system starts and

168
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,550
then you have the the width and the

169
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:01,720
height of the coordinate system because

170
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:04,600
even though the canvas is infinite the

171
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,700
coordinate system has to be finite now

172
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,590
together these values make up the

173
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:10,410
coordinate system and they are initially

174
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:13,210
initially identical to the initial

175
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:15,460
coordinate system so when you create an

176
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:17,020
SVG in Illustrator for example and you

177
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:18,669
export that SVG you're going to find

178
00:06:18,669 --> 00:06:20,260
that the view box the width and the

179
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:21,520
height on the view box are going to be

180
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,080
identical and equal to the width on the

181
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:23,860
height on the SVG

182
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:26,470
this is the default state but things

183
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:28,360
start to get a little bit confusing and

184
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,400
too exciting when you start changing

185
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,289
these values and this is where I'm going

186
00:06:32,289 --> 00:06:33,590
to be using

187
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:36,740
my different accordant Gordian system

188
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:45,500
demo bigger so I create it just I'm

189
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,270
gonna make them identical at first so

190
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:49,220
the gray coordinate system that you see

191
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:50,660
here is the coordinate system

192
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:53,180
established on the SVG so the SVG is 800

193
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:55,520
pixels wide by 600 pixels high and

194
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:58,670
initially the coordinate system on the

195
00:06:58,670 --> 00:07:00,350
canvas which is the view box is

196
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:03,290
identical this is what we have here okay

197
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:06,410
now by changing the values I created

198
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:08,330
this demo three years ago when I was

199
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:10,580
first getting into SVG I was started

200
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:12,040
changing the values of the view box

201
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:14,690
unexpected things happened I banged my

202
00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:15,950
head against the wall for two weeks

203
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:18,040
before I got finally to the aha moment

204
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:20,300
where I figure out the difference

205
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:22,010
between them and the only reason I was

206
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:23,780
able to do it is because I created this

207
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:25,310
to visualize them otherwise it would

208
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:28,550
have been really difficult so view box

209
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:30,260
viewport there initially the same but

210
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:31,850
you can change the value of the width

211
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:33,710
and the height of the view box inside so

212
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:37,160
if you make it bigger the aspect ratio

213
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:39,110
of the view box inside of the SVG is

214
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:41,120
different now but by default the browser

215
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,600
is going to the browser Maps the the

216
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,580
user the view box coordinate system to

217
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:48,560
the viewport coordinate system so by

218
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,230
default even no matter how big the view

219
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:53,390
box becomes it's going to be contained

220
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:56,450
inside of the viewport contained or not

221
00:07:56,450 --> 00:07:57,800
contained that depends you can also

222
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:01,190
control that say you also want to change

223
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:02,630
this now the first thing you may have

224
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:05,360
noticed is by changing the values of the

225
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,190
view box by making them bigger you're

226
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:09,260
scaling the contents of the SVG down if

227
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:11,870
you make it smaller you can scale the

228
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:16,220
contents of the SVG up so this is one of

229
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:18,320
the ways that you can manipulate SVG is

230
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:20,240
using the view box now the MINIX and min

231
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,490
y the x and y are outside the scope of

232
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:24,710
the structure I'm gonna be not going

233
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:25,190
over them

234
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:27,320
so right now assume that you have some

235
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:29,540
content inside of the SVG the view box

236
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:30,950
has a different aspect ratio from the

237
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:32,960
SVG so you have some white space at the

238
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,550
top white space at the bottom that's

239
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:36,770
fine just like background images and CSS

240
00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:40,219
you are able in SVG you can tell the

241
00:08:40,219 --> 00:08:42,020
browser if you want the entire view box

242
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:43,070
to be

243
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:45,020
ximenos if you want the entire view

244
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:46,340
books to be contained inside the

245
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:47,990
viewport or if you wanted to cover the

246
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:50,090
entire viewport area background images

247
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:52,160
in CSS if you set the background size to

248
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,960
contain you're gonna get this result if

249
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:56,180
the background of the of the element has

250
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:57,380
a different aspect ratio from the

251
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:59,390
element itself you can tell the browser

252
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:01,010
to either make it can't be contained

253
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:02,840
inside of the element which means that

254
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,370
you will get some white space on top on

255
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:07,250
and on the bottom or left and right or

256
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:09,050
you can tell the browser that you want

257
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:11,090
it to scale it up as much as possible to

258
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:13,010
cover the entire background area even if

259
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:15,650
that means cropping out some parts of

260
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:17,300
the image now you can do exactly the

261
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:18,980
same thing with SVG if you use the

262
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:21,230
preserve aspect ratio attribute now this

263
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:24,440
is what I have here keep in mind that

264
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,360
this drawing here you could have

265
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,550
anything on the view box I just happen

266
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:30,620
to have a parrot here because I'm a bird

267
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:33,200
person I don't like I don't have much

268
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,270
against cats but I'm a bird person so I

269
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:36,650
have a parrot here and I have a lot of

270
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:38,450
white space here but you can imagine an

271
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:41,630
entire SVG scene or illustration now if

272
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:43,040
I change the value of the preserve

273
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,320
aspect ratio from meet which is the same

274
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:48,830
as contained in CSS to slice which is

275
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:52,400
the same as cover I get this I don't

276
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,680
have any white space and that at the top

277
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:56,180
and the bottom so this is the view box

278
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:58,100
where the view box starts now at the top

279
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:00,860
but what's happening here is the view

280
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:02,690
box via canvas has been scaled up as

281
00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:04,340
much as possible to cover the entire

282
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:06,920
viewport area and it happens to be white

283
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:09,080
in my case but you know it has been

284
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,910
scaled up initially it is centered just

285
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:12,770
like the background position Center

286
00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:14,840
Center you can change the position of

287
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:17,330
that image as well for example sometimes

288
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:19,220
you position a background image in CSS

289
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:21,650
by saying top left so it starts at the

290
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:23,270
top left corner you can do that as well

291
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:26,810
using x-men women it's the similar to

292
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:29,390
top left you can get this you can also

293
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:32,090
the default value is x-men Twyman which

294
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:33,770
is the center you're centering it this

295
00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:37,340
way you can also choose xmax ymax so now

296
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:40,940
I'm showing the bottom right area of my

297
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:42,670
canvas inside of the viewport

298
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:46,970
now imagine using this so suppose you

299
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:48,620
have an image here any kind of image

300
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:50,900
that has a different aspect ratio from

301
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,610
the container of that image and you want

302
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:54,980
to be able to crop that image and

303
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:56,600
position it inside of that container any

304
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:59,240
way you want this is possible with SPG

305
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:05,630
so let's get back to no not yeah that's

306
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:11,550
it

307
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:13,689
so as you can imagine just to recap

308
00:11:13,689 --> 00:11:15,999
because of our ability to use and

309
00:11:15,999 --> 00:11:17,439
manipulate the under coordinate system

310
00:11:17,439 --> 00:11:19,180
we are able to create all kinds of great

311
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:21,040
effects and techniques to do a myriad of

312
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,990
things in SVG one of these things is

313
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:24,720
cropping and preserving aspect ratio of

314
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:28,839
non SVG images so CSS currently does

315
00:11:28,839 --> 00:11:30,639
that we currently have the object fit

316
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:32,519
and object position properties in CSS

317
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:35,410
using object fit you can the contents of

318
00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:37,240
an image or a video for example could be

319
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:39,759
also video can be set to scale up and

320
00:11:39,759 --> 00:11:42,040
down shrink or stretch as necessary to

321
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,660
fit into the width and the height you

322
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:47,139
specify so further for example suppose

323
00:11:47,139 --> 00:11:49,480
that you have an avatar image all of the

324
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:51,579
avatar images need to be square ok and

325
00:11:51,579 --> 00:11:53,050
you have a CMS like WordPress and you're

326
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:55,059
allowing your authors to upload upload

327
00:11:55,059 --> 00:11:58,059
images of their own they don't upload a

328
00:11:58,059 --> 00:11:59,589
square image so you're going to have to

329
00:11:59,589 --> 00:12:01,569
be able to crop that image and scale it

330
00:12:01,569 --> 00:12:03,639
and put it inside of that square area

331
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:05,680
that you have this is possible in CSS

332
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,180
using objects with an object position

333
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:09,850
object position tells you how you can

334
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:11,829
position the image and object fit does

335
00:12:11,829 --> 00:12:14,170
something like this so I have an image

336
00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:17,559
here again a doc and I have a square so

337
00:12:17,559 --> 00:12:19,029
you can tell the browser if you want the

338
00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:21,550
image to be fit inside of the square

339
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:23,410
without preserving the aspect ratio so

340
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:25,779
it kind of shrinks horizontally here you

341
00:12:25,779 --> 00:12:27,100
can tell it that you want it to be

342
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:28,930
contained which creates white space at

343
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:30,730
the top at the top and bottom you can

344
00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:32,649
tell it to cover it which is the most

345
00:12:32,649 --> 00:12:35,050
used value so it covers the entire

346
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:38,649
square area and crops out any extras and

347
00:12:38,649 --> 00:12:41,319
it's going to be centered by by default

348
00:12:41,319 --> 00:12:44,079
none means that it's not going to be

349
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:45,730
doing any scaling or stretching at all

350
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:47,620
and scale down is very similar to

351
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:49,120
contain with very minor minor

352
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,430
differences this is pretty cool so using

353
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:53,500
just one line of CSS you can allow your

354
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,179
users to upload any kind of images that

355
00:12:55,179 --> 00:12:57,040
they want while preserving the aspect

356
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,779
ratio and your designs but the browser

357
00:12:58,779 --> 00:13:01,089
support is not really good and as usual

358
00:13:01,089 --> 00:13:02,649
our main problem is Internet Explorer

359
00:13:02,649 --> 00:13:04,600
even a message currently doesn't support

360
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,939
it but it's coming in this upcoming edge

361
00:13:06,939 --> 00:13:10,329
version so suppose that you do still

362
00:13:10,329 --> 00:13:14,259
need us to provide support for IE so you

363
00:13:14,259 --> 00:13:15,429
will probably want to look for a

364
00:13:15,429 --> 00:13:17,499
different solution so you can either use

365
00:13:17,499 --> 00:13:19,660
this as an enhancement if you don't care

366
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:22,839
about IE if you can start supporting

367
00:13:22,839 --> 00:13:23,590
only the

368
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:25,180
versions of all browsers I do have

369
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:27,370
clients who do that by the way which is

370
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:30,700
amazing means 2017

371
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:32,530
so you can check the port for object

372
00:13:32,530 --> 00:13:35,920
fill by using the supports rule you like

373
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:39,040
you only apply the CSS styling of the

374
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,990
images if the object property is

375
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:42,370
supported which is pretty cool but if

376
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:44,650
you want to support older browsers you

377
00:13:44,650 --> 00:13:46,870
may come up with a solution I think a

378
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:48,370
lot of developers already do this on the

379
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:50,260
back end so they do all of the cropping

380
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:51,910
on the back end before sending the

381
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:53,920
cropped image image to the front end but

382
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,110
you don't even need to do that using

383
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:59,140
this small SVG snippet you can do

384
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:01,630
exactly that so instead of embedding can

385
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:04,780
you see the code so some of you are

386
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:06,720
doing this some are just some are this

387
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:10,090
so using I'm gonna go through the code

388
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:12,460
shortly using the snippet you can

389
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:14,410
instead of embedding an image tag on

390
00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:16,240
your page you would be embedding an SVG

391
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:19,300
okay the SVG has a width and a height a

392
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:20,050
view box

393
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:22,000
it always has a view box and it has a

394
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,070
preserve aspect ratio usually you can

395
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:25,810
omit the preserve aspect ratio and let

396
00:14:25,810 --> 00:14:26,950
the browser handle everything but if

397
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:28,000
you're going to be doing something like

398
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,680
this you want it to be there and you

399
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,600
want to change the value now inside of

400
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,900
the SVG you have an image tag I am a GE

401
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:38,950
the SVG the XML image tag you link to

402
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:41,020
the user uploaded image inside of the

403
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:43,270
image tag okay the width and the height

404
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:45,760
of the image are set to be 100% by 100%

405
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,190
which means that they will scale up to

406
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:50,290
fill the entire view books not the

407
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:51,490
viewport okay

408
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:54,070
the SVG width and height determined the

409
00:14:54,070 --> 00:14:56,080
viewport so which is going to be for

410
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:58,210
example a square on your page the image

411
00:14:58,210 --> 00:15:01,810
may not be square so you have some white

412
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:03,610
space inside of the SVG the view box

413
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:06,970
value is going to be 0 0 image X and

414
00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:08,860
image Y at the image X and image Y are

415
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:10,270
going to be the width and the height of

416
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:12,160
the user uploaded image so try to

417
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:15,130
imagine it you have s Square and you

418
00:15:15,130 --> 00:15:17,080
have which is the SVG and you have an

419
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:19,090
image inside of the SVG with a different

420
00:15:19,090 --> 00:15:21,520
aspect ratio the view box has the same

421
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,920
dimensions as that image so we get the

422
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,110
exact same thing we got earlier the

423
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:27,720
white space on top and on the bottom

424
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:31,180
okay so in this case what's happening

425
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:34,660
here is you've used s we just as the

426
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:36,620
regular container for your

427
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:38,570
jpg image or whatever PNG image or

428
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:40,700
Ruster image okay it's not you're not

429
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:42,800
using SVG as an image format anymore

430
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,540
using it as dog meat just like a div and

431
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:47,450
and an HTML it's just a wrapper here now

432
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:49,070
using the preserve aspect ratio you can

433
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:51,200
specify the alignment if you wanted to

434
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,550
be contained if you wanted to be covered

435
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:54,170
if you want to move it inside of it

436
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:57,170
cropping scaling everything happens like

437
00:15:57,170 --> 00:15:59,690
this so an example would be the width

438
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:01,490
and height of the SVG could be 140

439
00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:04,460
pixels the user uploads an 800 by 500

440
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:07,670
pixels image you link to that image and

441
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:09,350
then all of the work is done in the

442
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:12,440
preserve aspect ratio you probably if

443
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:14,090
you want to do the kind of cropping that

444
00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:16,640
CSS does by default most of the time it

445
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:18,530
would be preserved aspect ratio slice

446
00:16:18,530 --> 00:16:21,140
which is similar to cover and eczema

447
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:24,770
Twyman so the image is cropped to a

448
00:16:24,770 --> 00:16:26,600
square without using a single line of

449
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,610
CSS and with browser support that go

450
00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:31,340
away that goes way back are you gonna

451
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:33,110
see it shortly this code is missing

452
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:35,750
something so you've replaced an image

453
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:37,880
tag with an SVG but it's missing

454
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:42,220
something what is it say out loud

455
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:45,770
yeah the alt tag you should never serve

456
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:47,960
an image without an alt tag even if the

457
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,760
image is just decoration keep the alt

458
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,680
tag empty as long as you keep it there

459
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:54,650
okay so we don't have any alt tags on

460
00:16:54,650 --> 00:16:56,660
image elements inside of SVG but we do

461
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:59,030
have an alternative we have the title

462
00:16:59,030 --> 00:17:01,250
element inside of the SVG the title

463
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:03,440
element is similar to an alt tag so you

464
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,600
can give your image a title you should

465
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,580
always include a title for all of your

466
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:09,530
SVG images if you can or if they are not

467
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:12,470
simply just a creation you can even add

468
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:14,090
the desk element which is short for

469
00:17:14,090 --> 00:17:15,620
description so if you I want to add the

470
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:17,150
title and a description to your image

471
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:19,310
you can add that and this snippet here

472
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:21,830
gives you all kinds of scaling and

473
00:17:21,830 --> 00:17:24,800
preserving aspect ratios in HTML all the

474
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:27,770
way back to IE 9 because i 8 does not

475
00:17:27,770 --> 00:17:33,700
support SVG's know CSS required now

476
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:35,630
suppose you've cropped your image to

477
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:38,090
square dimensions the next step is to

478
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:40,580
make it responsive okay the maintaining

479
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:42,560
aspect ratio and CSS while making the

480
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:45,620
image image fluid is not very easy so if

481
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:47,570
the browser width if the if the width of

482
00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:49,700
the image is 100% how do you tell the

483
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:50,660
browser that you want

484
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:52,250
the height of the image to always be

485
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:54,350
equal to the width of the image now in

486
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:56,600
the future and future CSS specifications

487
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:59,120
there there will be away so tab Atkins

488
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,530
told me that they will be specking out

489
00:18:00,530 --> 00:18:02,299
something so that we will be able to

490
00:18:02,299 --> 00:18:04,130
preserve aspect ratio CSS sometime soon

491
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:07,789
but right now we cannot do that so this

492
00:18:07,789 --> 00:18:10,100
is particularly a problem for inline SVG

493
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:13,100
s or SVG is embedded using an iframe by

494
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:15,020
default the default size for replaced

495
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:17,780
elements in CSS is 300 pixels by 150

496
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:20,240
pixels diff replaced elements are

497
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,340
elements like an iframe where the size

498
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:24,590
of the item is not really defined by the

499
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:26,390
iframe itself its defined by the

500
00:18:26,390 --> 00:18:28,159
contents and because you don't really

501
00:18:28,159 --> 00:18:29,570
know the size of the contents the

502
00:18:29,570 --> 00:18:30,799
browser doesn't know the size of the

503
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:32,630
iframe and it's going to give it in that

504
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:35,510
case a default size of 350 pixels by 150

505
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:38,659
pixels an inline SVG if the SVD doesn't

506
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:40,789
contain any content and it doesn't have

507
00:18:40,789 --> 00:18:42,409
any dimensions or anything if you've

508
00:18:42,409 --> 00:18:45,140
ever maybe created an SVG sprite the SVG

509
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:46,549
sprite contains symbols that are not

510
00:18:46,549 --> 00:18:48,289
displayed on the page maybe some of you

511
00:18:48,289 --> 00:18:50,299
may have run into this where you get

512
00:18:50,299 --> 00:18:52,370
some empty white area on the page and

513
00:18:52,370 --> 00:18:53,720
you don't really know where where that

514
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:54,200
came from

515
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,510
it's because of that SVG is a replaced

516
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:57,980
element and the browser is going to be

517
00:18:57,980 --> 00:19:00,260
giving it 350 pixels by 150 pixels

518
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:03,200
unless you tell it otherwise now when

519
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,780
you embed an SVG in line it's going to

520
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:07,370
be as long as it has a view box it's

521
00:19:07,370 --> 00:19:09,169
going to scale as you expect it to and

522
00:19:09,169 --> 00:19:11,510
all of the browser's expect and accept

523
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:13,730
and ie so what II's gonna do it's gonna

524
00:19:13,730 --> 00:19:15,919
make the width of the SVG scale as you

525
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:17,600
would want it to scale but it's gonna

526
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:20,330
fix the height 150 pixels because it's

527
00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:22,460
done so in order to fix that and in

528
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:23,840
order to preserve aspect ratio for

529
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:26,659
anything essentially in CSS you need a

530
00:19:26,659 --> 00:19:28,909
technique which is commonly commonly

531
00:19:28,909 --> 00:19:31,100
known as the padding hack so I'm gonna

532
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:33,980
go over how it works I'm gonna show you

533
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:36,530
an example so to make an SVG responsive

534
00:19:36,530 --> 00:19:38,900
with a preserve aspect ratio first you

535
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:42,260
wrap the SVG in a container now I want

536
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:44,360
you to remember the last thing that we

537
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:47,120
did okay so we have an image or an SVG

538
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,980
with a specific aspect ratio and that

539
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:51,049
SVG contains an image a raster image

540
00:19:51,049 --> 00:19:52,520
inside of it with a different aspect

541
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:54,679
ratio now what you need to do is you

542
00:19:54,679 --> 00:19:56,600
need to make sure that the SVG scales up

543
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,220
and down while maintaining the aspect

544
00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:01,120
ratio of the image inside of it

545
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:03,610
so in order to do that you wrap the SVG

546
00:20:03,610 --> 00:20:06,220
in a container you collapse the

547
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:09,070
containers height you give it any width

548
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:10,480
value that you want it could be 100

549
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,490
percent 70 percent 50 percent whatever

550
00:20:12,490 --> 00:20:16,090
and then you apply the padding top as

551
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:17,560
Dennis mentioned something at the

552
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:19,270
beginning of his talk when you set the

553
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:22,120
padding in CSS using percentage values

554
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,830
it's going to be relative to the width

555
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:25,900
of the element not the height so even if

556
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:28,900
you say padding top 50% padding top is

557
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:31,720
going to be set 50% of the width of the

558
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:34,510
element not 50% of the height so if

559
00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:37,030
suppose you've collapsed the height of

560
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:38,680
the container it doesn't have a height

561
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:40,510
anymore its height zero and then you

562
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:43,390
apply a top padding to that element so

563
00:20:43,390 --> 00:20:45,790
you're extending expanding the height

564
00:20:45,790 --> 00:20:47,850
again but the height this time is

565
00:20:47,850 --> 00:20:50,680
created by the padding and the padding

566
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:52,840
is set and percentages which is relative

567
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:55,390
to the width so you have the height that

568
00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:56,920
is relative to the width and you've

569
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:59,410
established an aspect ratio so we want

570
00:20:59,410 --> 00:21:00,790
our container here to have the same

571
00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:03,490
aspect ratio as the SVG view box which

572
00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:04,990
is the image inside of it I know this is

573
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:07,150
a little bit too much but it's it's

574
00:21:07,150 --> 00:21:09,970
really cool so how do you determine the

575
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:12,220
value of the padding top it's with this

576
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:14,050
formula so you get the aspect ratio of

577
00:21:14,050 --> 00:21:17,590
the SVG view bucks in this case as good

578
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:19,270
you hide over SVG width and then you

579
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:22,630
multiply it by this value all right so

580
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:25,570
you have SVG contained inside of a

581
00:21:25,570 --> 00:21:28,450
container the SVG is still there you've

582
00:21:28,450 --> 00:21:29,980
collapsed the height of the container

583
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:32,410
okay so now the SVG is hanging outside

584
00:21:32,410 --> 00:21:34,810
of it and then you've added a padding to

585
00:21:34,810 --> 00:21:38,350
the container cool but the SVG has been

586
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:40,900
pushed down now so in order to put it

587
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:42,190
back into the container you're going to

588
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:45,100
need to be using absolute positioning so

589
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:46,960
you have to start by creating an aspect

590
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:49,240
for creating a positioning context on

591
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:51,640
the container by using position:relative

592
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:54,250
and then you position the SVG absolutely

593
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:56,560
inside of the container and you've

594
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:59,350
established an aspect ratio responsively

595
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:03,740
and this is what it looks like

596
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:08,190
this is a video it should work yeah so I

597
00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:14,010
have an SVG here oh I don't see it here

598
00:22:14,010 --> 00:22:16,679
if I change the preserve aspect ratio

599
00:22:16,679 --> 00:22:18,600
value now I've cropped the image inside

600
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:20,669
of it so this is one of the things you

601
00:22:20,669 --> 00:22:27,809
can do I don't see the cursor now you

602
00:22:27,809 --> 00:22:29,669
can also change the aspect ratio of the

603
00:22:29,669 --> 00:22:33,510
entire viewport and it's responsive no

604
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:35,549
matter what the aspect ratio of the SVG

605
00:22:35,549 --> 00:22:37,290
is going to be fully fluid and

606
00:22:37,290 --> 00:22:43,630
responsive

607
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:46,160
another thing you can do with SPG so the

608
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,900
first section recovered how SVG is used

609
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:50,090
just as a mere container for raster

610
00:22:50,090 --> 00:22:52,730
images in order to crop scale and

611
00:22:52,730 --> 00:22:54,470
manipulate them any way you want by

612
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:56,330
preserving with while also preserving

613
00:22:56,330 --> 00:22:59,000
aspect ratio now JPEGs have better

614
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,360
compression rate ratios than PNG is for

615
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:04,370
photographic data JPEGs generally

616
00:23:04,370 --> 00:23:05,960
speaking they always have smaller file

617
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,970
sizes than PNG s now what if you could

618
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:10,970
get the compression ratio of a JPEG

619
00:23:10,970 --> 00:23:14,210
while serving a PNG image so you would

620
00:23:14,210 --> 00:23:17,000
serve a PNG image with transparency but

621
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,230
you would get the compression ratio of

622
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:21,559
the JPEG surprise-surprise you can do

623
00:23:21,559 --> 00:23:24,559
that using using SVG now again our SVG

624
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:26,390
will serve as a mere container for a

625
00:23:26,390 --> 00:23:28,400
bitmap image and then we'll use some SVG

626
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:32,419
magic which aks SVG masks to get the

627
00:23:32,419 --> 00:23:34,250
transparency of the PNG while serving

628
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:36,169
the JPEG now the idea behind this

629
00:23:36,169 --> 00:23:38,270
technique is to use an SVG mask to clip

630
00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:40,520
out the areas of the JPEG that you do

631
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:41,750
not want to see that you want to be

632
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:44,000
transparent so we end up serving a JPEG

633
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,580
with simulated alpha channels thus

634
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:49,309
combining the transparency of a PNG with

635
00:23:49,309 --> 00:23:51,890
the compression rate of a JPEG for

636
00:23:51,890 --> 00:23:53,240
example suppose we have the following

637
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:55,820
image here the image on the left is what

638
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:58,070
we want to display it is a PNG image

639
00:23:58,070 --> 00:24:01,070
with another bird is out of it so we

640
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:03,980
start with a jpg JPEG version of the

641
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:06,410
image in the middle it doesn't have any

642
00:24:06,410 --> 00:24:07,910
transparent areas and then you create a

643
00:24:07,910 --> 00:24:10,490
mask illuminance mask in this case to

644
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:13,220
mask out the areas of the end of the

645
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:16,490
JPEG image that you do not want okay so

646
00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:18,320
the luminance mask means that the

647
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,850
luminance areas of the mask represent

648
00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:21,350
the areas of the SVG that you that you

649
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:23,780
want to keep so the white area here is

650
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:25,669
the DOE which we want to keep and

651
00:24:25,669 --> 00:24:26,630
everything in black

652
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:28,280
when this mask is applied to the image

653
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:29,570
in the middle we're going to get the

654
00:24:29,570 --> 00:24:33,710
result over there using SVG so we use

655
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:35,870
SVG to apply the mask so you have an SVG

656
00:24:35,870 --> 00:24:37,940
you have a depths element depths element

657
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:40,610
is short for definitions anything you

658
00:24:40,610 --> 00:24:42,650
put inside of a depth element in SVG is

659
00:24:42,650 --> 00:24:43,940
not going to be rendered on the page

660
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:46,160
you're literally just defining templates

661
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,929
that you want to be used or applied

662
00:24:47,929 --> 00:24:50,390
somewhere else so inside of the Deaf's

663
00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:53,030
element i create a mask that mask is

664
00:24:53,030 --> 00:24:55,280
actually an image so you're using an

665
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:55,740
image

666
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:58,770
as a mosque straight forward so we have

667
00:24:58,770 --> 00:25:00,270
the pigeon mosque we're referencing it

668
00:25:00,270 --> 00:25:03,059
here and then you embed your JPEG image

669
00:25:03,059 --> 00:25:05,280
with a really cool compression rates and

670
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:08,700
you apply the mask to it at the bottom I

671
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:12,110
hope it's visible I hope you can see it

672
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:16,200
and the SVG the mask and the image

673
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:19,230
element have the same dimensions because

674
00:25:19,230 --> 00:25:21,570
it's the same image and this is all you

675
00:25:21,570 --> 00:25:26,760
need you're serving a JPEG and a JPEG so

676
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,230
will you get the compression of the JPEG

677
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:29,700
and you're making it transparent using

678
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:31,770
SVG masks now one of the most frequent

679
00:25:31,770 --> 00:25:34,260
questions that I get here is how does

680
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:37,320
this work with responsive images so if I

681
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:39,390
only serve the 1x or 2x versions of the

682
00:25:39,390 --> 00:25:41,070
image what if I want to serve 1 X 2 X 3

683
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:42,690
X depending on the resolution of the

684
00:25:42,690 --> 00:25:44,970
image I've not tried that yet but I

685
00:25:44,970 --> 00:25:47,370
imagine it could use a foreign object so

686
00:25:47,370 --> 00:25:49,500
a foreign object is an element in SVG

687
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:52,320
which tells the XML parser that the

688
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,630
content inside of me is not really XML

689
00:25:54,630 --> 00:25:57,300
so you could use picture and source that

690
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:59,340
I imagine I haven't tested it yet so but

691
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:01,170
you could use maybe picture source set

692
00:26:01,170 --> 00:26:03,450
all kinds of HTML stuff inside of the

693
00:26:03,450 --> 00:26:05,309
SVG so you would replace the image

694
00:26:05,309 --> 00:26:07,050
element here with a foreign object that

695
00:26:07,050 --> 00:26:09,420
contains picture and source set and you

696
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:11,190
would still apply the mask to it and you

697
00:26:11,190 --> 00:26:15,960
get the compression that you want now

698
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:18,120
just like you can optimize raster image

699
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:20,850
delivery with SVG can also optimize SVG

700
00:26:20,850 --> 00:26:24,720
delivery with SVG so I was I worked on

701
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,640
the new Smashing Magazine redesign which

702
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,200
I don't know one well I think it will

703
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,730
get public soon but we've been saying

704
00:26:29,730 --> 00:26:31,050
some for like a year so I'm not really

705
00:26:31,050 --> 00:26:34,230
sure you should ask Vitaly one of the

706
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:35,760
things that we had in the new magazine

707
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,620
is we have these three new membership

708
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:39,000
plans ok

709
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,640
I built the front and so I had to embed

710
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:43,860
all of these things now for every

711
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:45,660
membership plan on the membership page

712
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:47,760
we have a title and name for each

713
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,890
membership type one of them a supporter

714
00:26:49,890 --> 00:26:50,370
member

715
00:26:50,370 --> 00:26:52,350
I feel smashing they have changed these

716
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:54,120
illustrations I've also changed but the

717
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:55,590
technique behind them is still the same

718
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:57,510
plus the cute little illustration is

719
00:26:57,510 --> 00:26:58,140
really nice

720
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:01,500
so one thing there are a couple of

721
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:03,750
important things to note here the text

722
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:06,720
inside of these images or no first of

723
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,390
all these images are used

724
00:27:08,390 --> 00:27:11,060
instead of the headings so you have a

725
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:12,980
section that describes the supporter

726
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:14,870
plan but that section does not have a

727
00:27:14,870 --> 00:27:16,670
title so when it comes to accessibility

728
00:27:16,670 --> 00:27:17,210
or

729
00:27:17,210 --> 00:27:19,310
reading in general you need a title for

730
00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:21,560
that section right the title is inside

731
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:23,750
of the image which means that the text

732
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:25,040
inside of this image needs to be

733
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:27,830
selectable searchable and accessible now

734
00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:29,270
there are a couple of things when you

735
00:27:29,270 --> 00:27:31,850
when you have an SVG even though this is

736
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:33,680
a perfect candidate for SVG you need to

737
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:36,050
first test that SVG is actually a good

738
00:27:36,050 --> 00:27:38,090
candidate for the image so at first when

739
00:27:38,090 --> 00:27:39,440
I saw these illustrations they have a

740
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:42,530
lot of details I imagine that well when

741
00:27:42,530 --> 00:27:44,270
an SVG contains a lot of effects a lot

742
00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:46,550
of details a lot of information the file

743
00:27:46,550 --> 00:27:49,070
size of the SVG can get so big that

744
00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:51,590
you're better off using a PNG instead so

745
00:27:51,590 --> 00:27:53,930
at first I thought okay I need the text

746
00:27:53,930 --> 00:27:56,270
to be accessible so I need as an SVG but

747
00:27:56,270 --> 00:27:57,970
I need to test the performance first

748
00:27:57,970 --> 00:28:00,890
luckily the SVG size was exactly the

749
00:28:00,890 --> 00:28:03,230
same as the PNG size so I was good I was

750
00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:05,750
able to use this I can use SVG I can

751
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:07,820
have the text inside of it the text

752
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:09,620
inside of the SVG unless you turn it

753
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:12,350
into outlines which means shapes it's

754
00:28:12,350 --> 00:28:13,550
going to be searchable selectable

755
00:28:13,550 --> 00:28:16,220
accessible just like HTML text users can

756
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:19,280
select it with the mouse SEO all kinds

757
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:21,950
of stuff comes with it by default so

758
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:23,510
after deciding I was going to go with

759
00:28:23,510 --> 00:28:26,260
SVG I had to start decide to think about

760
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:28,850
what kind of embedding technique am I am

761
00:28:28,850 --> 00:28:30,560
I going to use we have seven ways to

762
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:32,480
embed SVG is on a page which one should

763
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,430
you use the the answer to that question

764
00:28:34,430 --> 00:28:35,870
is always it depends it depends it

765
00:28:35,870 --> 00:28:37,880
depends so since I want the text to be

766
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:39,650
searchable selectable accessible and I

767
00:28:39,650 --> 00:28:41,690
want to be able to apply the font face

768
00:28:41,690 --> 00:28:44,720
Miha in this case to that text the easy

769
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:47,480
there are two ways you can do that first

770
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:50,570
of all you can have the SVG be external

771
00:28:50,570 --> 00:28:53,300
reference that SVG externally but in

772
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:54,920
that case you would have to go into the

773
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:57,350
SVG define the font face there and then

774
00:28:57,350 --> 00:28:59,270
apply to the text which means that you

775
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:01,220
would have to maintain two sets of

776
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:04,160
styles in the main CSS and in the SVG I

777
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:06,920
didn't want that so I try to only have

778
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,360
one source of truth as much as possible

779
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:12,050
so I figured I could do it inline if I

780
00:29:12,050 --> 00:29:13,970
am betty's SVG's inline I will get all

781
00:29:13,970 --> 00:29:15,830
the benefits and I will go into the main

782
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:17,540
stylesheet I will apply the front face

783
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:20,809
to this text and it works it does work

784
00:29:20,809 --> 00:29:24,139
but I couldn't really like imagine

785
00:29:24,139 --> 00:29:29,950
having to embed this inline in your HTML

786
00:29:29,950 --> 00:29:35,179
it's not done yet not yet this is only

787
00:29:35,179 --> 00:29:37,789
one of them not all three of them

788
00:29:37,789 --> 00:29:40,190
every one of those illustrations was so

789
00:29:40,190 --> 00:29:43,070
huge so I didn't want to embed the SVG

790
00:29:43,070 --> 00:29:45,649
externally I didn't I wasn't able I

791
00:29:45,649 --> 00:29:48,019
wasn't going to embed it and line like

792
00:29:48,019 --> 00:29:50,299
this so I needed to come up with a

793
00:29:50,299 --> 00:29:52,820
better solution and that is when I

794
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:54,919
started thinking I mean I can go into

795
00:29:54,919 --> 00:29:57,289
the SVG and I can change the code inside

796
00:29:57,289 --> 00:30:00,110
of it so I thought why don't I get the

797
00:30:00,110 --> 00:30:03,379
benefits of SVG text also serve the

798
00:30:03,379 --> 00:30:05,360
benefits of an SVG illustration but

799
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:08,629
separate them so I thought I could

800
00:30:08,629 --> 00:30:11,419
separate the illustration from the text

801
00:30:11,419 --> 00:30:15,889
inside of it and see how that works so I

802
00:30:15,889 --> 00:30:17,509
ended up doing something like this

803
00:30:17,509 --> 00:30:22,700
I had an inline SVG and the text I went

804
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:24,470
into each one of those illustrations and

805
00:30:24,470 --> 00:30:26,299
I removed the text from them okay so

806
00:30:26,299 --> 00:30:28,490
right now I'm referencing an SVG

807
00:30:28,490 --> 00:30:32,840
inside of an inline SVG I'm getting HTTP

808
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:35,059
cache I mean I'm getting caching there's

809
00:30:35,059 --> 00:30:37,190
gonna be an extra HTTP request but

810
00:30:37,190 --> 00:30:39,559
that's okay the file size wasn't really

811
00:30:39,559 --> 00:30:41,269
big and we're gonna be able to cache the

812
00:30:41,269 --> 00:30:43,129
image which is really good but the image

813
00:30:43,129 --> 00:30:45,259
does not now have any text so I thought

814
00:30:45,259 --> 00:30:48,100
I could just add the text in line and

815
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:51,710
you position the text because both the

816
00:30:51,710 --> 00:30:53,899
illustration and the text here are part

817
00:30:53,899 --> 00:30:56,360
of the same SVG so you have an SVG that

818
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:58,070
contains an SVG and that also contains a

819
00:30:58,070 --> 00:30:59,929
piece of text what you're left with in

820
00:30:59,929 --> 00:31:02,059
this case is to just position the text

821
00:31:02,059 --> 00:31:04,309
on the illustration in a way that gives

822
00:31:04,309 --> 00:31:07,460
you the result that you initially had so

823
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:10,999
then if you want to go on and style the

824
00:31:10,999 --> 00:31:13,129
text apply a font face apply a full

825
00:31:13,129 --> 00:31:15,529
color make it bold style that you can do

826
00:31:15,529 --> 00:31:17,090
that from the main see a style sheet

827
00:31:17,090 --> 00:31:20,929
without having to maintain to like the

828
00:31:20,929 --> 00:31:24,470
SVG in one place and the page and

829
00:31:24,470 --> 00:31:28,309
another page but I have something wrong

830
00:31:28,309 --> 00:31:30,710
here and it's intentional I didn't know

831
00:31:30,710 --> 00:31:33,230
it when I bothe the site but later I did

832
00:31:33,230 --> 00:31:33,840
but

833
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:36,110
I keep it on the slide intentionally so

834
00:31:36,110 --> 00:31:38,580
supporter is written all caps inside of

835
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:41,010
the HTML this is not good screen errors

836
00:31:41,010 --> 00:31:42,870
are going to read this out loud as su

837
00:31:42,870 --> 00:31:45,929
ppor ter and you don't want them to do

838
00:31:45,929 --> 00:31:48,809
that so FYI always make sure that your

839
00:31:48,809 --> 00:31:50,669
text is set in regular caps inside of

840
00:31:50,669 --> 00:31:52,380
your HTML and if you want to make it all

841
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:59,220
caps do that and CSS conditional

842
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:03,299
processing now you can again use SVG to

843
00:32:03,299 --> 00:32:07,200
handle SVG's or other SVG's or you can

844
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:10,110
use SVG to serve SVG while also

845
00:32:10,110 --> 00:32:13,529
providing non SVG as a fallback and this

846
00:32:13,529 --> 00:32:15,990
is like okay the SVG document structure

847
00:32:15,990 --> 00:32:18,120
specification defines elements and

848
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:20,580
attributes family the switch element

849
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:23,130
with three attributes that give us the

850
00:32:23,130 --> 00:32:25,620
ability to specify alternate viewing

851
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:27,240
depending on the capable a blah blah

852
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:29,279
which essentially means that it checks

853
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:31,409
if the browser is going to if it has

854
00:32:31,409 --> 00:32:35,190
support for SVG if it does its you serve

855
00:32:35,190 --> 00:32:36,929
a specific thing and if it does not it

856
00:32:36,929 --> 00:32:38,669
gives you the ability to to provide

857
00:32:38,669 --> 00:32:40,350
another thing as an alternative viewing

858
00:32:40,350 --> 00:32:42,899
experience now the three attributes on

859
00:32:42,899 --> 00:32:44,880
the switch element serve as sort of an

860
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:47,010
if statement or conditions if the

861
00:32:47,010 --> 00:32:48,899
conditions are met then the switch

862
00:32:48,899 --> 00:32:51,450
statement is true and the first element

863
00:32:51,450 --> 00:32:53,429
inside of the switch statement is going

864
00:32:53,429 --> 00:32:57,720
to be rendered so this is an example

865
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:01,320
here suppose you have a spreadsheet that

866
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:04,770
contains a set of icons every icon is

867
00:33:04,770 --> 00:33:07,350
defined inside of a symbol element you

868
00:33:07,350 --> 00:33:08,220
have a spreadsheet

869
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:11,429
essentially this is an inline SVG inside

870
00:33:11,429 --> 00:33:13,080
of an SVG I have the switch element

871
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:15,029
which is like switch case in Java Script

872
00:33:15,029 --> 00:33:17,850
or as else the first element is that of

873
00:33:17,850 --> 00:33:20,010
the switch element is the use use is

874
00:33:20,010 --> 00:33:22,110
referencing some icon Twitter

875
00:33:22,110 --> 00:33:25,500
so it's an SVG icon okay and it's the

876
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:30,029
first element inside of the SVG okay the

877
00:33:30,029 --> 00:33:31,799
second element is a foreign object which

878
00:33:31,799 --> 00:33:33,390
I mentioned before the foreign object

879
00:33:33,390 --> 00:33:35,610
means that everything inside of this

880
00:33:35,610 --> 00:33:39,179
area this foreign object is not XML so

881
00:33:39,179 --> 00:33:40,830
the foreign object allows you to embed

882
00:33:40,830 --> 00:33:44,700
none non SVG inside of an SVG okay

883
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:46,380
inside of the foreign object I have an

884
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:48,930
empty div which will serve as a fallback

885
00:33:48,930 --> 00:33:51,120
the that div is going to have a

886
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:53,430
background which is the icon but as an

887
00:33:53,430 --> 00:33:56,370
SVG as a PNG format so what happens here

888
00:33:56,370 --> 00:33:59,970
is if the browser supports SVG it's

889
00:33:59,970 --> 00:34:01,860
going to come to the switch statement

890
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:03,930
it knows SVG so it's going to render the

891
00:34:03,930 --> 00:34:06,060
first element inside of it which is our

892
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:09,240
SVG icon if a browser does not support

893
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:11,130
SVG is going to ignore the first line

894
00:34:11,130 --> 00:34:13,530
it's going to a can't see my mouse

895
00:34:13,530 --> 00:34:15,420
you can't know it's going to ignore the

896
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:17,190
first SVG root element it's going to

897
00:34:17,190 --> 00:34:18,660
ignore the switch because it doesn't

898
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:20,010
know what it is it's going to ignore

899
00:34:20,010 --> 00:34:21,480
they use because it doesn't know what it

900
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:23,550
is it's going to ignore for an object so

901
00:34:23,550 --> 00:34:25,080
this is just the parser going through

902
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:27,540
the elements it ignores for an object

903
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:29,460
and then it comes to at the hey I do

904
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:32,430
know HTML so I am going to render this

905
00:34:32,430 --> 00:34:35,010
div and this div happens to be an empty

906
00:34:35,010 --> 00:34:37,980
div with a PNG background image which is

907
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:44,990
our fallback for the SVG icon

908
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:49,649
now some browsers that are that do

909
00:34:49,649 --> 00:34:51,570
support SVG are going to download both

910
00:34:51,570 --> 00:34:53,070
adventures or request both images

911
00:34:53,070 --> 00:34:55,260
they're going to show the SVG icon but

912
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:56,760
they're also going to request the PNG

913
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:58,890
which is something you do not want so in

914
00:34:58,890 --> 00:35:00,510
order to prevent that you can add

915
00:35:00,510 --> 00:35:03,330
another SVG to the same page both of

916
00:35:03,330 --> 00:35:04,080
them are in line

917
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:07,349
now in the second SVG you hide the

918
00:35:07,349 --> 00:35:10,349
background image in the first SVG any

919
00:35:10,349 --> 00:35:12,450
Styles in the first SVG will affect the

920
00:35:12,450 --> 00:35:16,180
elements in the second and vice versa

921
00:35:16,190 --> 00:35:20,400
pretty cool there's a lot of SVG

922
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:23,010
inception but it's really like and I

923
00:35:23,010 --> 00:35:24,900
know I'm going fast but I don't want to

924
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:26,670
be taking up all of your lunch break or

925
00:35:26,670 --> 00:35:31,680
your coffee break this is also you also

926
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:33,210
have the same problem if you use an

927
00:35:33,210 --> 00:35:35,070
object to display and as we an SVG

928
00:35:35,070 --> 00:35:36,570
object is my absolute favorite

929
00:35:36,570 --> 00:35:38,160
SVG embedding technique because it

930
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:39,780
allows you to script the SVG using

931
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:42,180
JavaScript animates a style it you get

932
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:43,710
the caching you get the performance and

933
00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:45,450
everything so between the opening and

934
00:35:45,450 --> 00:35:47,609
closing object tags you provide the full

935
00:35:47,609 --> 00:35:50,190
back for the SVG your reference the SVG

936
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:52,470
and the object type attribute all good

937
00:35:52,470 --> 00:35:54,480
if a browser supports SVG is going to

938
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:56,070
display that if a browser does not

939
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:59,160
support SVG or if the SVG fails to load

940
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:01,619
if it doesn't find the SVG it's going to

941
00:36:01,619 --> 00:36:04,290
go into the object tag the contents of

942
00:36:04,290 --> 00:36:05,849
that and it's going to use the content

943
00:36:05,849 --> 00:36:07,950
inside of it as a fallback for the SVG

944
00:36:07,950 --> 00:36:10,710
now you can also again use an empty div

945
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:12,900
with a background image but make sure

946
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:16,020
that you hide that as well to prevent

947
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:20,400
any multiple downloads now SVG can do

948
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,869
more and I'm going to show these

949
00:36:21,869 --> 00:36:27,670
examples again live

950
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:28,940
one of the things that one of my

951
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:31,040
attendees at frontiers showed me was

952
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:33,470
this map here so they have this history

953
00:36:33,470 --> 00:36:36,619
map for the history of Syria this map

954
00:36:36,619 --> 00:36:39,410
the actual map is an image a raster

955
00:36:39,410 --> 00:36:41,660
image inside of the this viewport which

956
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:43,880
is an SVG so you have an SVG container

957
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:45,320
an SVG document and you're referencing

958
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:47,480
an image inside of it and these paths

959
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:50,030
here these circles like if you go to the

960
00:36:50,030 --> 00:36:51,859
places and you want to highlight stuff

961
00:36:51,859 --> 00:36:53,300
you can do that all this using

962
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:55,460
javascript and then you can use even a

963
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:58,339
little bit more of the SPG features to

964
00:36:58,339 --> 00:37:01,130
do this like each one of these colored

965
00:37:01,130 --> 00:37:03,230
areas as a path that has a fill color

966
00:37:03,230 --> 00:37:05,900
and then some of them I think it's

967
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:09,800
already here somewhere no but one of the

968
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:12,560
things that they have here is there you

969
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:15,109
can also use a blur on each one of these

970
00:37:15,109 --> 00:37:17,240
so it's like you're doing heat mapping

971
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:20,060
so you would have a path a colored path

972
00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:23,270
applied apply a blur to that so you get

973
00:37:23,270 --> 00:37:24,980
some sort of heat maps which is pretty

974
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:27,950
cool but but what's even nicer is you

975
00:37:27,950 --> 00:37:29,270
can do this which has been making the

976
00:37:29,270 --> 00:37:33,230
rounds on Twitter for the few days so

977
00:37:33,230 --> 00:37:35,510
you're using SVG here to serve JPEGs or

978
00:37:35,510 --> 00:37:38,089
PNG s again but you're you're doing

979
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:39,530
you're making the experience a little

980
00:37:39,530 --> 00:37:41,540
bit nicer so you're serving an outline

981
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:44,390
which is an SVG path you're serving an

982
00:37:44,390 --> 00:37:46,010
outline of the actual image that you're

983
00:37:46,010 --> 00:37:47,810
loading so if i refresh it again these

984
00:37:47,810 --> 00:37:50,570
are SVG's and an SVG container and once

985
00:37:50,570 --> 00:37:52,280
the images are lazy lazy loaded and

986
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:53,330
they're ready to be displayed you

987
00:37:53,330 --> 00:37:56,210
display them inside of these SPG's which

988
00:37:56,210 --> 00:37:57,710
is pretty cool and because it is really

989
00:37:57,710 --> 00:38:01,369
useful someone on Twitter mu he he

990
00:38:01,369 --> 00:38:03,619
created this WebP a coder that exports

991
00:38:03,619 --> 00:38:06,680
traced outlines as images so you give it

992
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:08,180
your images it's going to create those

993
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:11,060
SPG outlines for you and then you can

994
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:12,980
embed it he even created other stuff

995
00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:15,619
like you can you can create these

996
00:38:15,619 --> 00:38:18,589
learned previews as well which is pretty

997
00:38:18,589 --> 00:38:23,660
cool and my last slide is thank you

998
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:25,770
slide so thank you
