1
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:42,370

okay so guys I'm here to do a lot of

2
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:44,050
different things and to talk about stuff

3
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:45,880
that's kind of comfortable so you're

4
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,650
going to bear with me but I'm going to

5
00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:53,850
do my best we lie on iso 10x programmer

6
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:56,650
we don't usually think about this

7
00:00:56,650 --> 00:01:00,190
concept what it actually means it's a

8
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:04,299
hero myth it's a way of whining to be

9
00:01:04,299 --> 00:01:07,540
it's aspirational it's the thing we all

10
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:10,450
want people to see us as the person who

11
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:13,840
for width for who which if we weren't

12
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:18,729
there everything would fall apart but

13
00:01:18,729 --> 00:01:22,180
there's a downside to that even subsec

14
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:25,659
as amazing he is as many modules is made

15
00:01:25,659 --> 00:01:28,150
means very little without the rest of us

16
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:32,229
to use them we forget about that we feel

17
00:01:32,229 --> 00:01:34,360
bad when we don't measure up we feel bad

18
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:36,820
when we aren't the person we want to be

19
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:39,970
we let that be used as chacos or

20
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:41,530
something to make us feel like we or

21
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:44,380
lesser because of it I see a time and

22
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:45,670
time again especially with people who

23
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:47,979
aren't as old as we are as people who

24
00:01:47,979 --> 00:01:50,680
are in their 20s or 18s people like my

25
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,720
friend who's an iOS developer working

26
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,420
12-hour days for an internal deadline

27
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:58,150
for two weeks straight I'm going to tell

28
00:01:58,150 --> 00:02:00,070
you what I told him your pleasure

29
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:02,200
treating you like you need to quit

30
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,750
either by malice or just a mission they

31
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:06,640
are letting you burn yourself out it's

32
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,189
not healthy there's no reason for it but

33
00:02:09,189 --> 00:02:11,469
we let it happen time and time again

34
00:02:11,469 --> 00:02:14,139
because we can just forget about what's

35
00:02:14,139 --> 00:02:16,290
actually important

36
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:18,489
programming is neither a race nor

37
00:02:18,489 --> 00:02:21,489
marathon is about being first it's not

38
00:02:21,489 --> 00:02:23,290
about being the fastest about getting it

39
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:26,530
done that day it's about a lifetime of

40
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:29,409
training it's about meditation on it's

41
00:02:29,409 --> 00:02:31,299
about thinking about how to get better

42
00:02:31,299 --> 00:02:33,609
over time over the long run because

43
00:02:33,609 --> 00:02:36,340
we're in this till we basically can no

44
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:39,719
longer do it one way or another and

45
00:02:39,719 --> 00:02:42,909
programming is not just something you do

46
00:02:42,909 --> 00:02:45,730
with your mind we forget but it is body

47
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:48,069
it is something that we do with our

48
00:02:48,069 --> 00:02:51,909
hands it takes effort it takes work we

49
00:02:51,909 --> 00:02:53,590
don't want to always think about we

50
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:57,159
don't want to realize that it's not just

51
00:02:57,159 --> 00:02:59,650
some something that comes from here it

52
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:01,659
comes from everything and it's hard on

53
00:03:01,659 --> 00:03:04,780
the body it's hard on the eyes it's hard

54
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:07,269
on the mind in ways we don't always want

55
00:03:07,269 --> 00:03:08,829
to admit the fact that we tie ourselves

56
00:03:08,829 --> 00:03:10,810
up so much that we can't do other stuff

57
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:14,650
that we enjoy of course we're cheers

58
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:16,659
come we know all this we're better than

59
00:03:16,659 --> 00:03:18,489
that Matthew we have learned these

60
00:03:18,489 --> 00:03:23,799
lessons Chris Williams one

61
00:03:23,799 --> 00:03:27,340
of the best brightest people i know does

62
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:30,699
more than i can fathom at times but the

63
00:03:30,699 --> 00:03:34,599
same point guys he's constantly stressed

64
00:03:34,599 --> 00:03:37,389
out he's constantly overworked he has

65
00:03:37,389 --> 00:03:39,729
back issues he complains to me about

66
00:03:39,729 --> 00:03:42,419
being paying having time to do exercise

67
00:03:42,419 --> 00:03:45,340
no matter how awesome you are you can

68
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:46,840
become very myopic about what's

69
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,400
important to you to the point where your

70
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,900
health can deteriorate we think a life

71
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:55,989
at home and work we bring work with us

72
00:03:55,989 --> 00:03:59,169
we use the computer for fun instead of

73
00:03:59,169 --> 00:04:01,180
actually doing something else so that we

74
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:02,739
never actually get another mind frame

75
00:04:02,739 --> 00:04:04,810
and we're very good at deceiving

76
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:06,359
ourselves that this is not actually

77
00:04:06,359 --> 00:04:09,790
happening and we hate admitting it we

78
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:13,150
hate vulnerability to the point where we

79
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:15,930
would rather just not omit exist at all

80
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:18,489
we say to people fake it till you make

81
00:04:18,489 --> 00:04:21,070
it take on projects that you are not

82
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:23,849
comfortable with but never admit to that

83
00:04:23,849 --> 00:04:27,070
never ask for help well that's it goes

84
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:29,760
alone stack overflow and it's anonymous

85
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:33,340
so I am breaking a lot of rules right

86
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:37,420
now people I might be a bit crazy about

87
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:40,690
ask you right now to let me be very very

88
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:46,420
vulnerable for you for the few people

89
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:49,330
who do not know me my name is Matthew

90
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:53,560
Bergman I am a rubios masquerading as a

91
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:56,500
node.js person but I work in a small

92
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:59,860
console's II called Nova fabrica it's a

93
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:03,190
ruby shop and some of you might know me

94
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:05,620
from Cascadia jas where I gave a talk on

95
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:10,180
cryptography the awesome hat guy and I

96
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:13,660
have ours you might want to get up you

97
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:15,670
might want to come closer guys I'm sorry

98
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:17,260
there should be a stage but there isn't

99
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:18,700
so we're going to work with what we have

100
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:23,760
but this is my talk ours i stands for

101
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:28,990
repetitive stress injury this injury

102
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:33,820
that happens over a long time from

103
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:36,280
repetitive from the repetitive from rip

104
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:41,440
evan movement or position and we're

105
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,950
talking years many years ours is not

106
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:47,440
something that just happens because you

107
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,900
were typing weirdly for a few days it

108
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:54,760
comes from a lifetime of choices and it

109
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:57,310
doesn't happen just from work your body

110
00:05:57,310 --> 00:06:00,370
doesn't suddenly change because you're

111
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:03,730
no longer at work occupational hazards

112
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:06,010
are just hazards that happen occupations

113
00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:11,140
I don't overwork people I work 20 to 30

114
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:14,890
hours a week you can look at my invoices

115
00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:19,210
you can ask my boss but this still

116
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:23,600
happened to me because life builds up

117
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:33,070
how we relax with our TV or video games

118
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:36,169
I probably played 12 hour days straight

119
00:06:36,169 --> 00:06:38,599
with persona 4 I probably done more

120
00:06:38,599 --> 00:06:41,479
damage just from how I relax and from

121
00:06:41,479 --> 00:06:47,030
actually working on code or drinking at

122
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:50,080
bars not really looking how I sit down

123
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:54,259
or just life a friend of mine asked me

124
00:06:54,259 --> 00:07:01,189
of working in bed it's bad it is sadly

125
00:07:01,189 --> 00:07:07,039
it's very bad but those choices we make

126
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:12,289
and those choices happen whether we

127
00:07:12,289 --> 00:07:18,169
realize it or not you cannot look at a

128
00:07:18,169 --> 00:07:22,950
person and know that they're healthy

129
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:26,360
move you can't will get yourself and

130
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:33,349
know that you're Oh see this happens

131
00:07:33,349 --> 00:07:37,769
we're doing a live folks you mess up I

132
00:07:37,779 --> 00:07:42,669
thought I took care of myself I did

133
00:07:42,669 --> 00:07:48,129
because I worked out I exercised I

134
00:07:48,129 --> 00:07:53,419
quantified it but as I said before we're

135
00:07:53,419 --> 00:07:56,539
very good as sieving ourselves very good

136
00:07:56,539 --> 00:08:02,279
because I thought it was half it's not

137
00:08:02,289 --> 00:08:04,669
you can't look at a person know that

138
00:08:04,669 --> 00:08:08,120
they're healthy you can't look at

139
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,889
somebody and you can't look at yourself

140
00:08:09,889 --> 00:08:13,099
and know that it comes from taking

141
00:08:13,099 --> 00:08:15,860
meticulous notes because just because

142
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:19,460
you feel good today doesn't mean that

143
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:22,659
tomorrow you're going to feel good in

144
00:08:22,659 --> 00:08:28,909
2013 my hands began to feel different it

145
00:08:28,909 --> 00:08:33,560
began as a small ache for my elbows to

146
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:37,290
my pinky and ring fingers

147
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:41,669
the third but it didn't go away I

148
00:08:41,669 --> 00:08:49,779
started to stress out about it and when

149
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:52,140
you stress out you start researching and

150
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:54,310
that only leads to one thing on the

151
00:08:54,310 --> 00:09:01,510
internet cancer or in my case diabetic

152
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:03,579
neuropathy because my grandfather's are

153
00:09:03,579 --> 00:09:07,000
diabetic as ones my biggest fears I'm

154
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,579
terrified of getting it one day it was

155
00:09:09,579 --> 00:09:11,079
our cubital tunnel so I went with the

156
00:09:11,079 --> 00:09:13,570
worst option because that's what you do

157
00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:17,410
I stress myself so badly that I start

158
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:19,810
having other physical symptoms good

159
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:22,420
stress can do that I got pain in my legs

160
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:25,810
my mouth felt fuzzy I thought be able to

161
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:28,120
sleep I was breathing heavily all the

162
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,950
time while I went to my general

163
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:32,950
practitioner I was in so much pain I

164
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:34,990
couldn't walk and that was

165
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:37,630
stress-related but he thought it was all

166
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:40,420
stress so he told me to relax it gave me

167
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:44,850
an ties I hills and sent me on my way I

168
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:49,029
did feel better not perfect but I wanted

169
00:09:49,029 --> 00:09:51,190
to believe so I let things rest and I

170
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:53,470
had a trip to go on I was going to know

171
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:56,200
copy you she has copy you I was going to

172
00:09:56,200 --> 00:10:02,170
have so much fun Oh God but Don I got

173
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:06,370
off the plane my arms were numb and

174
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:12,490
burning there was a few days before the

175
00:10:12,490 --> 00:10:16,149
conference so I do what is probably the

176
00:10:16,149 --> 00:10:19,329
stupidest thing to do in that I continue

177
00:10:19,329 --> 00:10:23,199
to type I continue to work working

178
00:10:23,199 --> 00:10:26,170
through pain is stupid it's always

179
00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:28,029
stupid but you don't want to believe

180
00:10:28,029 --> 00:10:30,779
it's going to get worse so you continue

181
00:10:30,779 --> 00:10:35,410
and the ping does get worse I start

182
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:39,130
leaving events early and people who know

183
00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:41,769
me know me I party late I was out to 4am

184
00:10:41,769 --> 00:10:45,670
last night I'm so here doing this and I

185
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:50,600
will be out tonight again at 24 am

186
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:54,050
at no time for you I was leaving at

187
00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:57,829
eleven running bass trying to not die

188
00:10:57,829 --> 00:11:02,120
from the pain and pain is really

189
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:05,930
draining it makes you very aware of the

190
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:07,250
small choices you have to make

191
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:10,360
throughout the day like budding shirt or

192
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:15,709
just opening up doors because it's

193
00:11:15,709 --> 00:11:18,050
mentally taxing you only have so much

194
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:22,130
any energy throughout the day and you

195
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:25,279
use it up I'm gonna have to continue if

196
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:34,850
I forgot and it's depressing dude you're

197
00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:39,560
good please continue with the slides you

198
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:45,680
didn't you when I got to jjs console try

199
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:48,860
to control myself with it being

200
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:50,870
something simple like golfers elbow or

201
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:53,630
ten nights because they'll sound simple

202
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:56,899
and can be remedied in six weeks but

203
00:11:56,899 --> 00:11:59,209
there still are sigh they're still

204
00:11:59,209 --> 00:12:03,170
problematic they're still hard on the

205
00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:05,630
body of course I keep using this term

206
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:09,339
without really telling you what it means

207
00:12:09,339 --> 00:12:13,870
bars sorry RSI is an umbrella term

208
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:17,800
includes a lot of different syndromes

209
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:22,130
like runner's knee Qbert ah no focal

210
00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:27,709
dystonia and of course carpal tunnel but

211
00:12:27,709 --> 00:12:32,000
carpal tunnels just one when we focus on

212
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,550
just that one syndrome people can forget

213
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:36,829
about the other ones and ignore the pain

214
00:12:36,829 --> 00:12:38,149
that might be having other parts of

215
00:12:38,149 --> 00:12:44,839
their body hearth I is just it's micro

216
00:12:44,839 --> 00:12:48,529
traumas to the ligament and muscles it's

217
00:12:48,529 --> 00:12:51,139
information of the nerves and the

218
00:12:51,139 --> 00:12:55,810
tendons it's scar tissue building up its

219
00:12:55,810 --> 00:12:59,000
impingement is entrapment it's your body

220
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,810
not working correctly

221
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:05,200
parts are overworked parts and

222
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:10,720
underworked the pain moves I used to

223
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,089
wake up in the middle of night fearful

224
00:13:13,089 --> 00:13:15,279
that my shoulders would not be good the

225
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:20,830
next day instead of my arms because it

226
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:23,800
would change I wouldn't know how to deal

227
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,600
with it moved sometimes because it'd be

228
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:30,270
different it wouldn't be what I wanted

229
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:33,690
because the pain is just a symptom and

230
00:13:33,690 --> 00:13:37,150
your body is wrong and you know it's

231
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:38,800
wrong because it doesn't move the same

232
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,180
way as you know it's not just the pain

233
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:45,100
just making it you're truly scared by

234
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:48,820
the time I got back from jazz calm I was

235
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:51,130
in so much pain I couldn't look at a

236
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:54,820
computer correctly but because i was

237
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:57,550
still in denial i'm a moron so I

238
00:13:57,550 --> 00:14:00,610
continued to type if you don't take

239
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:03,540
anything else from this talk take this

240
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:07,410
working through pain is always stupid

241
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:10,600
don't do that it took me an extra two

242
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:14,140
weeks to take off time and by that point

243
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:16,540
I couldn't sleep at night because I had

244
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:21,670
so much pain in my neck I didn't know

245
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:25,050
what to do I remember just actually

246
00:14:25,050 --> 00:14:27,550
canceling on friends app to try to get

247
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:28,930
to the subway being so much paying for

248
00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:31,390
my fingers I couldn't walk correctly and

249
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:34,709
it's running a shower at night and

250
00:14:34,709 --> 00:14:38,709
sitting down and not knowing how we go

251
00:14:38,709 --> 00:14:40,510
on for another minute let alone another

252
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:46,630
hour a day a month a year this I'm

253
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:48,880
suicidal I don't know what I'm going to

254
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,160
do I started thinking about getting my

255
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:53,020
grandpa's instantly medicine to stop my

256
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:58,600
heart cut my throat with a knife jump

257
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:01,860
off a bridge

258
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:05,140
it's so easy to get their people much

259
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:06,520
easier than you think when you're really

260
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:09,250
pushed and you don't know what you're

261
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:14,790
going to do I tell no one I tell no one

262
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:17,320
because I rationalized seeing that

263
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:20,920
psychologists won't help because the

264
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,870
pain is what's causing my depression and

265
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:25,150
the pain is real is not an emotional

266
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:27,240
problem that can take another tack to

267
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:30,640
it's not going to go away I don't tell

268
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:33,640
my friends I don't tell my boss I just

269
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:37,720
try to deal and go see doctors and that

270
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,370
was a mistake I sort of talked to

271
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:42,400
somebody but I didn't because we're

272
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,560
afraid of vulnerability were afraid of

273
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:48,420
meaning they were not good enough and

274
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:51,630
the bathrooms don't really help because

275
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:54,370
you're just a bunch of ailing tap tests

276
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:57,339
you're not something they easily

277
00:15:57,339 --> 00:16:02,670
understand because they're just human

278
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:05,830
there there fallible they're just like

279
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:07,560
us when we're trying to bulk something

280
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:11,890
it's not simple it's not easy but we get

281
00:16:11,890 --> 00:16:15,320
so frustrated when they don't know

282
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:20,620
eventually I have two MRIs dimensions

283
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:23,140
the three months into the process three

284
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:27,700
months I still kind of grimace when I

285
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:30,220
think about how long I was in pain the

286
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:34,300
second one tells me that I do have a

287
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:36,580
thickening the omen earth which is

288
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:39,220
cubital tunnel so my original diagnosis

289
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:44,320
so many months ago was right I saw a

290
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:50,110
physical therapy it helps a bit but only

291
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:54,450
a bit because it's only six weeks long

292
00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:58,240
six weeks is not enough to recover from

293
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,640
all the damage at the end of it I'm

294
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:03,880
still in a lot of pain and i'm still

295
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:08,380
depressed and life goes on while you're

296
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:13,030
dealing with all this and november i was

297
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:15,280
giving a talk at cascade areas

298
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,530
some of you might have saw I did a

299
00:17:17,530 --> 00:17:20,830
really good job I was dying through that

300
00:17:20,830 --> 00:17:24,310
talk people I nearly quit three to four

301
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:27,370
times i called up saying i can't even do

302
00:17:27,370 --> 00:17:29,560
the slides i was in so much pain from

303
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:32,470
trying to just type it out I'm happy I

304
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:33,550
did it but I'm not going to tell you

305
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:36,880
what's easy because it wasn't I

306
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,530
literally did not know how I was getting

307
00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:39,940
through it at the end of the talk I took

308
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:42,100
two percocets basically just sat down on

309
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:45,520
the floor because I nearly was spent

310
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:50,260
that day so I decided I needed to be

311
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:53,260
more active and how I was dealing with

312
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:54,730
this because I kept waiting for other

313
00:17:54,730 --> 00:17:57,630
people to tell me how I needed a deal I

314
00:17:57,630 --> 00:18:02,410
first changed how I was working my old

315
00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:06,720
work station it was a cheap ikea desk

316
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:12,250
and a really really cheap chair terrible

317
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:15,040
for positioning terrible for back sport

318
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:17,590
got from a friend for fifty dollars used

319
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:20,440
it for five years TV netflix coating

320
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:23,140
everything i did at that desk it wasn't

321
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:27,430
helpful my new desk is much better it's

322
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:30,130
a standing desk now standing by itself

323
00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:33,580
is not that great it's the movement that

324
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:36,670
makes standing good because changing

325
00:18:36,670 --> 00:18:38,830
position is what's necessary for blood

326
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:40,870
flow to keep muscles from being coming

327
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:43,210
stagnant cuz steady by itself is very

328
00:18:43,210 --> 00:18:47,890
bad it causes joint compressive

329
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:51,190
thrombosis spider veins I know that

330
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:53,230
sounds out that much but I worked way

331
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:55,090
too hard on these legs to let them

332
00:18:55,090 --> 00:18:58,260
become ugly with little spider veins and

333
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:02,050
you still get that posture you can still

334
00:19:02,050 --> 00:19:03,490
slouch you can still cause a lot of

335
00:19:03,490 --> 00:19:04,810
damage it's because they're standing

336
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:07,530
doesn't mean you have good posture of

337
00:19:07,530 --> 00:19:10,780
course we use this without understanding

338
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:13,420
what good posture actually means good

339
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:17,320
posture is neutral spine it is bone over

340
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:19,960
boat it's your rib cage over your pelvic

341
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:22,750
bone over your kneecaps over your ankles

342
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:26,320
and it's not stagnant you need to move

343
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,260
you need a stretch

344
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:30,270
it's not just what it's what you go back

345
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:31,890
to because just standing up straight

346
00:19:31,890 --> 00:19:34,650
with your chest out not moving for a

347
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:37,350
whole day would be awful it needs to be

348
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:43,050
dynamic I also start going to the gym a

349
00:19:43,050 --> 00:19:47,700
lot an exercise is very complex

350
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:50,240
especially for people who don't normally

351
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:55,740
exercise I spent a lot of time

352
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:58,980
researching going over the diff stuff I

353
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:02,910
needed to learn by posture hours and

354
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:08,010
hours and the things I think are most

355
00:20:08,010 --> 00:20:09,720
important is that you need to get a

356
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:16,290
trainer you need to go in with a game

357
00:20:16,290 --> 00:20:17,970
plan a need to videotape yourself

358
00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:19,530
because you do not have the body

359
00:20:19,530 --> 00:20:22,200
awareness that's going to allow you to

360
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:25,080
do proper form and you can go with the

361
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:28,920
buddy but you really shouldn't because a

362
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:31,770
buddy is extra cognitive load it's extra

363
00:20:31,770 --> 00:20:33,720
stuff you need to think about because

364
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:35,660
you need to match up your schedule I

365
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:38,010
started going them to my gym because of

366
00:20:38,010 --> 00:20:40,140
my friend Anisha she has a gym right

367
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:42,300
next to her house and she told me that

368
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:44,400
we could be buddies and exercise

369
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:48,690
together every time I'm a 20 minute walk

370
00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:50,880
from there guess how many times we

371
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:55,260
worked out together 0 you cannot wait

372
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:57,900
for somebody else to make you do this

373
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:59,880
you need to decide that this is

374
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:04,380
something you want to do and I'm still

375
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:06,900
learning and it's weird to be a job now

376
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:09,870
because I can talk about protein powders

377
00:21:09,870 --> 00:21:13,740
and how to exercise correctly and all

378
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:15,900
this other stuff that we don't always

379
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:21,390
think about as hard because I get a lot

380
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:23,340
of pushback a ton so people don't want

381
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:24,960
to hear this don't want to think about

382
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:29,370
any of this but i found that progression

383
00:21:29,370 --> 00:21:32,130
is key that you need to get stronger

384
00:21:32,130 --> 00:21:33,900
that you need to think about that and

385
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:36,330
you need to get your pain to go down if

386
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:39,840
you're dealing with our zilog I and that

387
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:40,440
you

388
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:43,140
need to understand your body that you

389
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:46,350
cannot work through pain that is bad you

390
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:47,850
know what difference between the soy is

391
00:21:47,850 --> 00:21:49,080
when I look at and tear you need to

392
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:53,430
respect that boundary and that you

393
00:21:53,430 --> 00:21:56,550
cannot become intimidated I don't care

394
00:21:56,550 --> 00:21:58,860
how you indentify if you're trans you're

395
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:00,870
female of your mail if your gender queer

396
00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:02,910
this is for something this is something

397
00:22:02,910 --> 00:22:04,590
that everybody should be doing you

398
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:05,850
shouldn't worry about poking up you

399
00:22:05,850 --> 00:22:07,260
should be worrying about getting healthy

400
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:11,070
and strong I also start doing yoga if

401
00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:13,500
you can't tell I do a lot of yoga I do a

402
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:17,220
 ton of yoga and this is because

403
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:20,250
ton of yoga and this is because
it's really good for ours I pain that

404
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:22,290
our Pilates because it forces you to

405
00:22:22,290 --> 00:22:25,290
work the entire body not just the pain

406
00:22:25,290 --> 00:22:29,570
points you really have to do everything

407
00:22:29,570 --> 00:22:32,550
because it's your body not working as i

408
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:34,260
said before when your body is out of

409
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:36,690
alignment you need to work on the total

410
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:43,770
structure I hear you guys I really hear

411
00:22:43,770 --> 00:22:46,530
you I do not have time for this I hate

412
00:22:46,530 --> 00:22:51,630
exercise yes yes I hate an exercise

413
00:22:51,630 --> 00:22:54,260
before this it's been six months now and

414
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:56,340
I might be doing this in front of you

415
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:59,220
but guess what people I hate exercise

416
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:04,110
still I rather do anything else but the

417
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:06,390
point is that you do it for the results

418
00:23:06,390 --> 00:23:08,580
you do feel better while doing but like

419
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:09,930
I'd rather play a video game not going

420
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:14,130
to lie to you I goin up Dino this is not

421
00:23:14,130 --> 00:23:16,650
going to change but I do this because I

422
00:23:16,650 --> 00:23:19,500
feel better not perfect it's been nearly

423
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:21,660
eight or nine months i'm still not my

424
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:23,850
base level but i feel a lot better now

425
00:23:23,850 --> 00:23:26,190
i'm able to go out i'm able to feel

426
00:23:26,190 --> 00:23:31,710
normal I measure my I measure my sis

427
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:33,330
Kassadin small victories being able to

428
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:36,850
open doors without thinking about it

429
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:40,310
sitting in chairs and not being in pain

430
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:44,100
resting my arms on a table I know that

431
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:46,260
sounds so sap is true for months I

432
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:48,390
couldn't do this i would go to

433
00:23:48,390 --> 00:23:49,530
restaurants and have to sit like this

434
00:23:49,530 --> 00:23:52,350
because i was in so much pain when i

435
00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:53,389
would rest this

436
00:23:53,389 --> 00:23:56,269
apart on a table it was horrible and

437
00:23:56,269 --> 00:23:57,619
made me feel really awkward because I

438
00:23:57,619 --> 00:23:59,149
couldn't just like be normal I was like

439
00:23:59,149 --> 00:24:00,589
being really stiff and weird but I had

440
00:24:00,589 --> 00:24:03,499
to deal with it I found out the pain is

441
00:24:03,499 --> 00:24:06,799
a really good motivator really good we

442
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:08,690
got it got me to like gain 10 pounds of

443
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:12,379
muscle but dame by itself is not useful

444
00:24:12,379 --> 00:24:17,749
you need hope hope that the pain is

445
00:24:17,749 --> 00:24:19,789
going to improve hope that you could do

446
00:24:19,789 --> 00:24:23,419
more that you can do today because he is

447
00:24:23,419 --> 00:24:25,070
great metal Vater but when you only have

448
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:29,019
pain you just spiral down to despair and

449
00:24:29,019 --> 00:24:33,919
that's not fun we're getting older we're

450
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:36,979
getting really older and you have to

451
00:24:36,979 --> 00:24:41,269
treat your body with respect you do the

452
00:24:41,269 --> 00:24:44,059
apple tree with respect because if you

453
00:24:44,059 --> 00:24:46,039
don't it's just going to get crusty and

454
00:24:46,039 --> 00:24:51,829
old and nobody likes that because we're

455
00:24:51,829 --> 00:24:54,139
not immortal maybe sub seconds I kind of

456
00:24:54,139 --> 00:24:55,820
feel like the modules he makes my pee

457
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:57,619
vampirism like every time he makes a

458
00:24:57,619 --> 00:25:03,739
module he like loses three days but

459
00:25:03,739 --> 00:25:05,329
there I wish I could tell you there was

460
00:25:05,329 --> 00:25:07,399
a shortcut I work out like four or five

461
00:25:07,399 --> 00:25:10,279
hours every week there are nae shortcuts

462
00:25:10,279 --> 00:25:12,169
at a standing desk is not going to be

463
00:25:12,169 --> 00:25:15,769
the solution it helps with like getting

464
00:25:15,769 --> 00:25:19,039
a little bit more weight off and a

465
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:21,739
little bit more energy but honestly you

466
00:25:21,739 --> 00:25:24,859
need a density it's what matters now I'm

467
00:25:24,859 --> 00:25:29,779
lucky I'm a freelancer I get to make my

468
00:25:29,779 --> 00:25:33,589
own hours most people don't if you work

469
00:25:33,589 --> 00:25:36,019
40 hours a week and have a family I see

470
00:25:36,019 --> 00:25:38,570
you to do five hours of exercise a week

471
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:41,509
is a lot I mean you could lift your

472
00:25:41,509 --> 00:25:43,609
children but i don't think the Milo

473
00:25:43,609 --> 00:25:46,459
creative methods for everybody I like a

474
00:25:46,459 --> 00:25:52,570
chai tea myself we need to make health

475
00:25:52,570 --> 00:25:57,409
at what we do and mental health at any

476
00:25:57,409 --> 00:25:59,779
other industry we need to make longevity

477
00:25:59,779 --> 00:26:02,989
a tenant other industry now something we

478
00:26:02,989 --> 00:26:06,270
do have to work

479
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:09,230
because it's not just about you it's

480
00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:11,240
about your company you need to be there

481
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,530
for your company I don't understand why

482
00:26:12,530 --> 00:26:14,180
you don't understand that if you can no

483
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:16,340
longer work they lose out on valuable

484
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:18,130
assets it should be something that's

485
00:26:18,130 --> 00:26:21,020
symbiotic but they treat you like it

486
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:27,340
doesn't matter because at the people

487
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:29,780
your job is going to be gone before your

488
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:32,420
body is before your language is before

489
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:35,330
your company ipos or folds its with you

490
00:26:35,330 --> 00:26:38,030
to the end of your life and you need to

491
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:43,700
treat it with respect and all that

492
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:45,950
knowledge all that wonderful things

493
00:26:45,950 --> 00:26:47,710
they've you learn throughout your life

494
00:26:47,710 --> 00:26:50,420
it doesn't matter if you can't actually

495
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:56,270
do it because you're in so much pain we

496
00:26:56,270 --> 00:26:58,450
need to think more about stuff like this

497
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:01,820
my talk is imperfect I am imperfect as

498
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:04,190
you know as I kind of didn't set up the

499
00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:06,770
timing right for my yoga I apologize for

500
00:27:06,770 --> 00:27:10,520
that but this is important people we

501
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:12,740
need to think more about stuff thats

502
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:14,420
related to programming that isn't

503
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:17,000
programming we don't we treat frameworks

504
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,620
is more important as people that needs

505
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:27,050
to stop I know I could have done better

506
00:27:27,050 --> 00:27:29,540
today but that doesn't matter we always

507
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:33,920
can do better I hate asking people to

508
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:37,490
join in with me but right now just take

509
00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:39,830
a deep breath and think about something

510
00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:41,330
that's important to your life be it

511
00:27:41,330 --> 00:27:42,860
health be something else but something

512
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:44,300
that's not just related to the language

513
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:46,460
of JavaScript because we're better than

514
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:49,550
that we're more than that I want us to

515
00:27:49,550 --> 00:27:50,750
start treating ourselves with that

516
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:52,670
respect because our community is special

517
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:55,490
because we act like people most of the

518
00:27:55,490 --> 00:27:58,060
time

519
00:27:58,070 --> 00:28:06,390
just breathe in and out I'm very honest

520
00:28:06,390 --> 00:28:08,790
when I say this year has changed me it

521
00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:11,790
will have changed me for 10 years from

522
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:15,600
now and that I will remember I will be

523
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:16,740
there for you if you're going through

524
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:20,820
this or anything else because we're

525
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:22,620
getting older and we're going to

526
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:24,480
struggle a lot with so many things we're

527
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:28,770
not even aware of I'm here for you I

528
00:28:28,770 --> 00:28:38,340
mean that thank you they're also

529
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:42,240
references people come on if you if a

530
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,550
this is touch you look at these books

531
00:28:44,550 --> 00:28:46,680
they have helped me a lot understanding

532
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:49,950
how to exercise how to think about

533
00:28:49,950 --> 00:28:51,630
health and they're not perfect but

534
00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:53,820
they're there and we thank you so much

535
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:55,980
