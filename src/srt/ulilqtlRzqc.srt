00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:13,640

it's unlikely you see code in black and

2
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:15,740
white and I mean that literally a

3
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:17,960
developer uses syntax highlighting to

4
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:19,970
visually visually differentiate portions

5
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:22,699
of her code but these signifiers between

6
00:00:22,699 --> 00:00:24,380
different kinds of content aren't

7
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:25,730
something that we interpret consciously

8
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:28,489
they're typographic cues that add to the

9
00:00:28,489 --> 00:00:30,339
conventions of the programming language

10
00:00:30,339 --> 00:00:33,410
you the developer are reading and

11
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:35,300
skimming code and how effectively you're

12
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:37,340
able to do this is actually be informed

13
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:38,899
by many of the same principles that

14
00:00:38,899 --> 00:00:40,640
determine how effectively you can read

15
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,850
anything else syntax highlighting is

16
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:45,920
designed and its success is informed at

17
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,500
least in part by the typography just

18
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:49,940
like with any other discipline specific

19
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:52,429
typography there are some details that

20
00:00:52,429 --> 00:00:53,899
are unique to the subject matter but

21
00:00:53,899 --> 00:00:56,120
many are generally applicable as well

22
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:58,030
and because of this typographic

23
00:00:58,030 --> 00:01:00,559
conventions in syntax highlighting can

24
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:02,300
teach us about using type in many other

25
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:04,879
situations designing longer form

26
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:06,470
articles visual identities user

27
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:08,240
interface design and other things

28
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,600
entirely when syntax highlighting is

29
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,060
successful we don't stop to appreciate

30
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:15,979
it and this is a good thing but it's

31
00:01:15,979 --> 00:01:17,210
something like it I'd like us to

32
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:19,369
dedicate some time to and its time and

33
00:01:19,369 --> 00:01:22,250
attention to today our work uses type

34
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:24,470
extensively and you probably know more

35
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:26,030
about how to apply some advanced

36
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:27,710
typographic features than you realize

37
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:29,719
directly through your familiarity with

38
00:01:29,719 --> 00:01:33,710
typographic conventions in code syntax

39
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:35,149
highlighting creates a visual hierarchy

40
00:01:35,149 --> 00:01:37,189
and just as they do in graphic design

41
00:01:37,189 --> 00:01:39,680
just all principles help explain how you

42
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,740
interpret the code you're reading

43
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:43,579
similarity through color is what we

44
00:01:43,579 --> 00:01:45,079
think of when we think of syntax

45
00:01:45,079 --> 00:01:46,969
highlighting typically the syntax is

46
00:01:46,969 --> 00:01:48,469
categorized for you with different hues

47
00:01:48,469 --> 00:01:50,270
it helps you immediately associate

48
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:52,039
pieces of code know that they're similar

49
00:01:52,039 --> 00:01:54,189
or dissimilar but this is just one way

50
00:01:54,189 --> 00:01:57,289
how pieces of sin taxes are highlighted

51
00:01:57,289 --> 00:01:59,180
and how typographic principles are used

52
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:02,270
within code various graphic design have

53
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:04,250
instructors have reminded me over the

54
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:06,320
years if it's the same make it the same

55
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,200
and if it's different make it different

56
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:10,729
color is far from the only method we

57
00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:12,290
have to associate and disassociate

58
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:13,790
things visually

59
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:15,260
type style typeface weight and

60
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:16,879
background color are a few that we see

61
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:19,640
in our code editors for example you

62
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:22,189
might use bolding to create sort of a

63
00:02:22,189 --> 00:02:24,829
headline for a class name or you might

64
00:02:24,829 --> 00:02:27,379
use a background color you might have a

65
00:02:27,379 --> 00:02:29,060
background color applied when you type

66
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:31,670
something incorrectly and this is always

67
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:33,439
faster than running tests to capture

68
00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:35,120
typos so I guess that's qualifies as a

69
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,900
talk on testing now but syntax

70
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:41,060
highlighting there isn't a single

71
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:42,439
correct way to do things there's

72
00:02:42,439 --> 00:02:44,450
conventions and they can be followed

73
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:47,930
ignored or intentionally broken and I

74
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:49,370
think comments are one of my favorite

75
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:51,799
examples of this how their design can

76
00:02:51,799 --> 00:02:53,150
place them anywhere in the hierarchy of

77
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:55,370
a document or your code editor they can

78
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:57,439
be subtle encouraging you to focus on

79
00:02:57,439 --> 00:03:00,409
the code or they can be the most

80
00:03:00,409 --> 00:03:01,760
prominent piece of your text editor

81
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,000
demanding to be read here they are side

82
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,129
by side the same piece of CSS but they

83
00:03:07,129 --> 00:03:14,670
have a very different visual hierarchy

84
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:17,450
continuity and symmetry are some other

85
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:18,590
principles that apply when we're

86
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:20,120
thinking about how syntax highlighting

87
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:23,389
is designed particularly for when we're

88
00:03:23,389 --> 00:03:25,609
writing code aligning a like elements

89
00:03:25,609 --> 00:03:27,440
and other contextual features can help

90
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,319
you keep your place while writing code

91
00:03:29,319 --> 00:03:32,720
one bracket might be highlighted when

92
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,690
you select a different one and so that

93
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:37,370
you are matched or if you're writing a

94
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:39,530
white space significant language or

95
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:40,760
using a white space significant

96
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:43,099
preprocessor you might have white space

97
00:03:43,099 --> 00:03:45,620
character shown or rules or lines appear

98
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:48,229
to guide your eye vertically and by

99
00:03:48,229 --> 00:03:50,000
maintaining the same syntax highlighting

100
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,440
theme for an extended period of time you

101
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,940
might actually find it your code easier

102
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:55,579
to read certainly familiarity influences

103
00:03:55,579 --> 00:03:57,319
our perception of code we become

104
00:03:57,319 --> 00:03:59,530
accustomed to our own theme and settings

105
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:02,150
when speaking about typefaces themselves

106
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:04,129
type designers whose an Atletico said

107
00:04:04,129 --> 00:04:06,019
readers read best what they read most

108
00:04:06,019 --> 00:04:09,439
and this has more to do explaining while

109
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:11,269
black letter and older books look

110
00:04:11,269 --> 00:04:13,400
challenging to read to us today but once

111
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,810
once the norm but on a much smaller

112
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:17,380
level I think it also is true for code

113
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:19,699
familiarity influences our perception of

114
00:04:19,699 --> 00:04:21,639
code when it's displayed elsewhere to

115
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:23,479
consider these two pieces of

116
00:04:23,479 --> 00:04:26,300
documentation both are familiar but for

117
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:27,570
very different reasons

118
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:29,280
on a first glance which are you more

119
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:33,570
likely to trust one common graphic

120
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:34,860
design tool that is noticeably absent

121
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:37,620
from this list is sighs sighs can very

122
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:39,840
clearly establish a visual hierarchy but

123
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,160
and this is something we do in

124
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,960
typography and book typography and on

125
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,310
the web of course through a type scale

126
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:46,380
but within our code editors most of us

127
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:47,610
would find it pretty strange if

128
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:49,590
different pieces of code were different

129
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:52,260
type sizes monospaced typefaces lose a

130
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:54,180
lot of their benefit for us if we start

131
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:56,130
changing the size of things at different

132
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:59,880
points and this is why I think Santa

133
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,770
exciting is a particularly interesting

134
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:03,120
to way to look look at some other

135
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,820
advanced typographic features syntax

136
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:07,380
highlighting cues developers on what

137
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:08,730
they're about to read without ever

138
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:10,950
involving type size and your familiarity

139
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:13,770
with typographic principles within code

140
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:15,690
means you already know how to

141
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:17,580
communicate these sorts of things within

142
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:19,650
other kinds of text as well this is

143
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:21,270
useful because whatever kind of project

144
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:22,860
you're working on it involves syntax

145
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:24,480
highlighting beyond code code doesn't

146
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,880
have an exclusive license on this color

147
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,740
and other forms of visual emphasis have

148
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:30,030
long been used within written and

149
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:32,220
typographic communication showing

150
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:34,620
relationships within writing is relevant

151
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:37,530
to all kinds of text and a prevalent

152
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:38,940
form of something you could call syntax

153
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:40,620
highlighting on the web is linked text

154
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:43,080
the distinct blue hyperlink signifies

155
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,940
that this text is different from the

156
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:46,680
rest around it these words are different

157
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,750
it says you can interact with them and

158
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:50,520
color has long been used to emphasize

159
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:53,400
content and this is a reproduction of an

160
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,350
earhart rat-boy page from the 15th

161
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:57,630
century where color is used in line for

162
00:05:57,630 --> 00:05:59,940
emphasis what about the beginning and

163
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:01,980
the end of a sentence period or other

164
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:03,660
punctuation hasn't always been used to

165
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:05,550
show this even our idea of the paragraph

166
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:07,650
wasn't always around the idea of using

167
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:11,760
space to separate ideas visually jumping

168
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:14,100
way way ahead even the idea of a type

169
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:15,930
family that can work in tandem is still

170
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:18,150
relatively new this is the typeface

171
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:20,160
univera designed by adrian frutiger a

172
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,170
multi-axis typeface system with

173
00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:23,910
different styles for weights and widths

174
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:26,130
and it's design is inspired by the

175
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:28,230
periodic table which includes how it's

176
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:31,140
presented to other designers type

177
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:33,090
designer Peter belak said thanks to

178
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:34,740
fruit ogre it is now common practice to

179
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:36,419
produce a dozen or more Styles when

180
00:06:36,419 --> 00:06:38,190
working on a new type family and you can

181
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:40,560
see that in his own typeface Greta this

182
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,490
is just Greta San

183
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:43,620
there's also a serif and a monospaced

184
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:46,139
version so this is something this is a

185
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:47,970
way of working for type designers now

186
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:50,400
but that's even true for someone who's

187
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,169
much much newer to type design like me

188
00:06:52,169 --> 00:06:54,599
I'm working with the application super

189
00:06:54,599 --> 00:06:56,580
polite or here and I've designed three

190
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:58,830
master styles and I can interpolate and

191
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:01,349
generate the other ideas the other

192
00:07:01,349 --> 00:07:04,800
potential styles in between this kind of

193
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,569
power is actually moving even closer to

194
00:07:06,569 --> 00:07:07,800
designers working on the web with

195
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,569
variable fonts which I'm not going to

196
00:07:09,569 --> 00:07:10,979
really cover in this talk but it means

197
00:07:10,979 --> 00:07:12,960
that the tools we have around us to

198
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,370
distinguish content for readers will

199
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:18,060
continue to be in transition in addition

200
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:19,830
to a variety of styles many

201
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:21,870
comprehensive contemporary typefaces

202
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:23,669
also include advanced typographic

203
00:07:23,669 --> 00:07:25,229
features that allow us to suggest

204
00:07:25,229 --> 00:07:27,690
different kinds of content or make

205
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:29,159
things more subtle for our readers in

206
00:07:29,159 --> 00:07:32,340
specific situations these advanced

207
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:33,750
typographic features have been included

208
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:35,490
and improved within fonts for many years

209
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:37,050
and are now viable to use on the web

210
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:38,940
they're called open type features and

211
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:40,949
just as we differentiate content using

212
00:07:40,949 --> 00:07:42,840
bold italic anchors and other visual

213
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,940
cues we can signify different kinds of

214
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:46,949
content using these advanced typographic

215
00:07:46,949 --> 00:07:50,370
features to our readers using CSS so one

216
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:51,719
you might already be familiar with is

217
00:07:51,719 --> 00:07:53,940
ligatures which in opentype is also

218
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:56,250
abbreviated to lyga and you might think

219
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:57,570
of ligatures as a beautiful way to

220
00:07:57,570 --> 00:07:59,280
connect two letters and that's true but

221
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,080
often the real goal is to resolve a

222
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:03,270
spacing issue within the typeface here

223
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:05,370
the F and the dot of the IR are too

224
00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:06,780
close together especially when used as

225
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:09,330
small sizes and a ligature can be a

226
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:11,250
functional and beautiful way to resolve

227
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:14,610
that spacing issue but as type designer

228
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:16,620
James T Edmondson has said sometimes you

229
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:18,300
need a ligature and sometimes you need

230
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:20,659
an F that just can just chill the F out

231
00:08:20,659 --> 00:08:23,639
in his thesis typeface Kovach you can

232
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:26,130
see here in the regular version that

233
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:27,419
there are some collisions happening

234
00:08:27,419 --> 00:08:29,639
ended the italics and one way to resolve

235
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:31,380
these would be a traditional more

236
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:32,789
traditional idea of a ligature where

237
00:08:32,789 --> 00:08:34,919
these things connect but he actually oh

238
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:37,880
here you go so that's highlighted and

239
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:40,169
but he actually designed the ligatures

240
00:08:40,169 --> 00:08:42,390
and the regular version so the flag of

241
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:44,039
the F and the dot of the iron moved

242
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:46,350
closer or further apart and the F and

243
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:48,660
the L don't collide anymore and then in

244
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:50,100
the italic version which is more

245
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:52,500
influenced by brush lettering he did a

246
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,029
more traditional literature where those

247
00:08:54,029 --> 00:08:54,520
things

248
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,740
act so these spacing issues can be

249
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:58,510
solved through the open type ligatures

250
00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:00,520
feature in a variety of different ways

251
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:02,920
in a typeface and you can enable this in

252
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,480
the fonts you're already using in your

253
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:07,060
CSS using the font variant ligatures

254
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:08,410
property and setting it to common

255
00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:10,600
ligatures but this is really the best

256
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:14,650
case scenario CSS font variant ligatures

257
00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:16,750
is a lower level property you can think

258
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:19,060
of it kind of like margin bottom where

259
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:20,740
we only set one direction of the margin

260
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:23,050
at once and then the higher level

261
00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:24,700
version of that is margin where we can

262
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:27,160
set all four directions at once the

263
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:29,620
higher level property for font variant

264
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:31,810
ligatures is font feature settings and

265
00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:33,670
this lets us set multiple open type

266
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:35,290
features at once so that's where that

267
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:38,800
lyga abbreviation comes into play so

268
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,330
here we're saying font feature settings

269
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:44,920
will use ligatures but that actually the

270
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:45,970
problem with this even though it has

271
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:47,620
better browser support as it breaks the

272
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:50,800
Cascade if I later want to set a

273
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,900
headline and define different open type

274
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:54,400
features I'm going to have to read

275
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,080
Eclair everything I've set on the body

276
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,630
which is really inconvenient but as

277
00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:00,130
Rachel said like five minutes ago

278
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:03,010
anything new in CSS you can use feature

279
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:06,460
queries to detect support so we already

280
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:08,530
had a really nice setup for future

281
00:10:08,530 --> 00:10:10,990
queries in the last talk but I'm

282
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:13,930
actually using supports not here so this

283
00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:16,150
is sort of an inversion of those feature

284
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:18,760
queries if font variant ligatures aren't

285
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,440
supported then we'll use font feature

286
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,630
settings otherwise we can use font

287
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:26,020
variant ligatures now this is kind of

288
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:27,760
confusing and we're only on the first

289
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,890
open type features so I can understand

290
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:31,600
if you're saying I'm not going to do all

291
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:35,170
that just to get ligatures fair enough I

292
00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:36,970
put together a little library for you

293
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:39,490
called utility open type which takes all

294
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:41,830
these advanced typographic features I'm

295
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:43,510
going to be talking about and assigns

296
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:46,600
them to those single to a single class

297
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:49,030
name those four-letter opentype feature

298
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:51,130
abbreviations so you can install it

299
00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:52,990
through NPM link to the CSS file

300
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:55,690
whatever build process you're using and

301
00:10:55,690 --> 00:10:57,610
then you'll have easy access to these

302
00:10:57,610 --> 00:10:59,020
features without having to write those

303
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:02,290
feature queries so to look at another

304
00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:04,420
application of that ligatures should

305
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:05,890
really be on by default in the browser

306
00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:07,960
but one that won't be is discretionary

307
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:08,440
ligature

308
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:10,300
they're ligatures that are applied at

309
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:13,660
your discretion here in this typeface

310
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:16,480
clinics lab there's an ST and a th

311
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,770
ligature which you probably wouldn't

312
00:11:17,770 --> 00:11:19,960
want on through the entirety of the body

313
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,580
copy in your text but you might want it

314
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:24,250
in a beautiful headline setting so you

315
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:26,410
could use font variant ligatures and

316
00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:27,880
instead of common ligatures you could

317
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:30,460
say discretionary ligatures or for

318
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:31,780
better browser support you could write

319
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:33,820
that kind of complicated supports query

320
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:37,780
or at least hard to remember or you can

321
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,610
use my utility opentype library if you

322
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:42,490
want and a pro I the d-league class name

323
00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:46,120
and then you'll have discretionary

324
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:49,000
ligatures in your headlines or wherever

325
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,820
you choose to apply them another really

326
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:53,620
interesting feature is contextual

327
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:56,680
alternates this is a lavanderia typeface

328
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,210
available through the lost type co-op

329
00:11:58,210 --> 00:12:01,210
it's a a lettering typeface or a

330
00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:03,790
typeface inspired by lettering so there

331
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:05,880
are features included that make it more

332
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:08,530
make it feel more like true lettering

333
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:10,750
done by hand and not a font to take

334
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:11,950
advantage of these features they'll

335
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:13,840
become if you take advantage of these

336
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,520
features that the typeface will be more

337
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:18,730
script like in this case in a at the end

338
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:21,550
of a word or phrase can get a flourish

339
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:23,110
and there's many other features like

340
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:25,330
that another one of my favorites is in

341
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:27,340
this typeface enemy by Shivan alla para

342
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:29,890
Mel it's supposed to it's a stencil

343
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:31,960
typeface but when you zoom in and look

344
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:35,230
closer you can see that the O's and the

345
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:36,790
case and the ease aren't actually the

346
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:39,160
same there's been different versions of

347
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,690
the glyph designs so when they sit

348
00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:42,820
alongside each other it feels more like

349
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:44,590
an organic stencil and less like a

350
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:49,090
repeating font so you can use this in

351
00:12:49,090 --> 00:12:51,070
your CSS with font variant ligatures

352
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:54,339
contextual or the C alt class in my

353
00:12:54,339 --> 00:12:59,020
library now we're halfway through the

354
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:01,240
second talk today and no one's talked

355
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:03,790
about emoji yet so I'm happy to be the

356
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:05,260
first person to mention emojis at this

357
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:09,010
conference this is a emoji icon set

358
00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:12,040
thing I designed for sad magazine and

359
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:15,640
magazine in Vancouver this is for their

360
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:18,850
secrets themed issue so this is what the

361
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:21,610
Apple emojis like look like there's no

362
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:22,209
contextual

363
00:13:22,209 --> 00:13:24,999
alternates feature in this icon set or

364
00:13:24,999 --> 00:13:27,910
this emoji typeface I designed for this

365
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:29,860
magazine it's supposed to look kind of

366
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:31,660
sketchy and hand-drawn so there's

367
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:33,429
actually variations of each one of the

368
00:13:33,429 --> 00:13:35,170
glyphs so when you type them in a row

369
00:13:35,170 --> 00:13:37,149
they swap out and make it feel more like

370
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:38,889
it was drawn by hand and it's less like

371
00:13:38,889 --> 00:13:41,499
a font and the reason I made it a font

372
00:13:41,499 --> 00:13:43,720
instead of just a series of images was

373
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,910
because it was for this secrets themed

374
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:48,160
issue and it let the designers of the

375
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,879
magazine Pam Ernest the art director i

376
00:13:51,879 --> 00:13:55,689
worked with used use it and encode

377
00:13:55,689 --> 00:13:57,579
secret messages with it without having

378
00:13:57,579 --> 00:14:00,699
to do that manually so it was used on

379
00:14:00,699 --> 00:14:02,230
things like the social media campaign

380
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:04,420
and I wasn't going to put this example

381
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:05,410
in but then I was like all right

382
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:07,839
developers like stickers so there's it's

383
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:11,259
on stickers postcards and then people

384
00:14:11,259 --> 00:14:14,429
can go to the website and decode those

385
00:14:14,429 --> 00:14:18,459
secret messages before you ask yes I am

386
00:14:18,459 --> 00:14:19,839
currently available for cryptography

387
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:24,610
work a more practical example of this

388
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:26,649
idea was done earlier this year by kimya

389
00:14:26,649 --> 00:14:28,809
Gandhi she wrote a really great article

390
00:14:28,809 --> 00:14:31,089
for alphabet org a blog I highly

391
00:14:31,089 --> 00:14:34,269
recommend you check out this is a Devon

392
00:14:34,269 --> 00:14:35,920
Gary typeface she did with many

393
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,350
contextual alternates the challenges of

394
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:39,639
doing this in a different in this

395
00:14:39,639 --> 00:14:41,170
language aren't one that I'm personally

396
00:14:41,170 --> 00:14:42,490
familiar with but I'm excited about

397
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:45,160
other designers type designers linguists

398
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:47,499
what linguists web developers talking

399
00:14:47,499 --> 00:14:49,089
about what it means to bring those

400
00:14:49,089 --> 00:14:51,579
things to the web the language specific

401
00:14:51,579 --> 00:14:53,259
considerations that are available in

402
00:14:53,259 --> 00:14:54,970
tight face is very but there are

403
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:56,679
features that help with that sort of

404
00:14:56,679 --> 00:15:00,639
thing for example in Dutch the IJ can be

405
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:02,980
treated as one glyph instead of two so

406
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:05,049
that this typeface by the type foundry

407
00:15:05,049 --> 00:15:08,249
underwear has a variation for that

408
00:15:08,249 --> 00:15:10,360
sometimes you also get to work with

409
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:12,670
people who are experts in their field so

410
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:15,549
I got to work with Americo takagi for a

411
00:15:15,549 --> 00:15:18,459
project for Google Fonts early access

412
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:20,709
Japanese typefaces and the specimens we

413
00:15:20,709 --> 00:15:23,019
design she really coached me through

414
00:15:23,019 --> 00:15:26,290
what it meant to deal with some Japanese

415
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:29,350
typography specific issues and you're

416
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:31,120
particularly lucky here in Singapore

417
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,589
because there's a really great series

418
00:15:32,589 --> 00:15:34,290
called letter love or

419
00:15:34,290 --> 00:15:36,209
by relay room there was an event last

420
00:15:36,209 --> 00:15:40,440
night talk about designing bilingual

421
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,509
multilingual typefaces and if you're

422
00:15:42,509 --> 00:15:44,070
interested in typography I highly

423
00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:45,420
recommend you go check out this event

424
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:49,410
series it runs every quarter and what

425
00:15:49,410 --> 00:15:50,519
another feature I wanted to talk about

426
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:53,519
is stylistic alternate so this one is

427
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:56,430
abbreviated as salt this is the same

428
00:15:56,430 --> 00:15:58,380
typeface lavanderia that we were looking

429
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:00,870
at in one of the other examples and so

430
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:02,850
is this by using some different

431
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:04,649
stylistic alternates you can get a

432
00:16:04,649 --> 00:16:05,850
pretty different feeling from the

433
00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:07,920
typeface and this might be an

434
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:10,170
interesting way if you're already using

435
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:12,300
a set of typefaces for a company you're

436
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:13,649
working for or something like that where

437
00:16:13,649 --> 00:16:15,149
it might actually be more versatile than

438
00:16:15,149 --> 00:16:17,250
you realized sometimes there's just a

439
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:19,139
few key glyphs in a typeface that really

440
00:16:19,139 --> 00:16:20,880
define its character and by having those

441
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,649
swapped out you can get a different

442
00:16:22,649 --> 00:16:26,550
feeling and I worked on the web based

443
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:28,470
type tester for the lost type co-op a

444
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:30,029
couple years ago where we tried to

445
00:16:30,029 --> 00:16:31,980
highlight these features in line for

446
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:34,380
people so as you're trying things out on

447
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:35,699
the website as they're trying out the

448
00:16:35,699 --> 00:16:37,110
typefaces those features are all

449
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:40,110
highlighted for you and this is where

450
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:42,269
the font feature settings property comes

451
00:16:42,269 --> 00:16:44,220
into play a bit more here we're setting

452
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:46,260
contextual alternates and stylistic

453
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:48,149
alternates so this is an idea of

454
00:16:48,149 --> 00:16:50,069
chaining together multiple open type

455
00:16:50,069 --> 00:16:53,579
features case sensitive forms are

456
00:16:53,579 --> 00:16:55,550
another category abbreviated as case

457
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:58,199
it's particularly I think it's becoming

458
00:16:58,199 --> 00:17:00,420
more and more applicable because we keep

459
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:03,540
using glyphs in ways that maybe they

460
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:05,790
weren't used that way before so the at

461
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:08,449
symbol is one of those if you're setting

462
00:17:08,449 --> 00:17:12,240
handles and usernames with an at and you

463
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,640
set it in all caps now that at symbol

464
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,049
kind of looks too small or like it's

465
00:17:16,049 --> 00:17:18,600
sitting too low compared to the all caps

466
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:20,549
letters so there are open type features

467
00:17:20,549 --> 00:17:22,530
and some typefaces that will correct

468
00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:24,209
that issue so you have a version that's

469
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:26,250
specifically for sitting alongside the

470
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:28,740
the all caps settings and you can use

471
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:32,460
that with case an extension of that is

472
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:35,700
small capitals small capitals are

473
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:37,169
specifically designed to sit along the

474
00:17:37,169 --> 00:17:39,210
lower case letters and these can sort of

475
00:17:39,210 --> 00:17:40,740
highlight things for our readers like

476
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:43,140
acronyms within a paragraph of text if

477
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:45,750
you have an all-caps word in the middle

478
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:46,530
of

479
00:17:46,530 --> 00:17:49,080
in the middle of a paragraph sometimes

480
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:50,700
it might draw a reader's attention away

481
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:53,280
when we don't want to do that so small

482
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,930
caps are designed specifically to sit

483
00:17:54,930 --> 00:17:56,730
alongside the lowercase letters they can

484
00:17:56,730 --> 00:17:58,380
still show someone that something is an

485
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:00,660
acronym but they stick out less in a

486
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:03,570
paragraph that said no small caps is

487
00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:05,460
better than pho or fake small caps

488
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:08,010
sometimes people will just scale down

489
00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:09,450
the uppercase letters to the height of

490
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:11,340
the lowercase letters with the intent of

491
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,650
making them look like small caps which

492
00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:16,590
is sort of in an attempt to mimic book

493
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:18,750
typography but what this ends up doing

494
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:21,780
is actually making the all cat the small

495
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:23,280
caps letters more distracting because

496
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,920
they feel much lighter or they feel

497
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:28,380
skewed in some way so this is a great

498
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:29,940
example that shows that by Matthew

499
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:31,470
butterick from his book practical

500
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:33,150
typography which I highly recommend you

501
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:35,430
can see the fake small caps feel much

502
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:37,590
lighter compared to the capital letters

503
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:39,090
where the real ones feel like they're

504
00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:42,020
properly designed to sit alongside them

505
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:44,760
so don't use the old font variant small

506
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,650
caps feature that creates fake small

507
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:49,050
caps the new property you're looking for

508
00:18:49,050 --> 00:18:52,350
is font variant caps small caps this is

509
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:54,180
all documented on that utility opens

510
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:57,360
type site as well so I use that on the

511
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,670
surge pricing page for the acronyms as

512
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:01,050
an example and you might say that's

513
00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:03,840
pretty annoying to go through and wrap

514
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,090
all those acronyms and span tags but

515
00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:07,380
there's actually a lot of tools that

516
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:11,010
will do that for you like typographers

517
00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:13,170
in Ruby and for WordPress and a lot of

518
00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:15,300
other things so you can continue writing

519
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:17,910
your content or letting your clients

520
00:19:17,910 --> 00:19:19,830
write your content and have some of

521
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:21,330
these spans applied to your markup for

522
00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:25,470
you another category there's other

523
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:27,000
categories specifically for numbers

524
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,290
since we've mostly been talking about

525
00:19:28,290 --> 00:19:30,990
Latin letters so far old style and

526
00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:34,080
lining numbers lining numbers typically

527
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,720
are the default in sans-serif typefaces

528
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,340
and they are designed to sit alongside

529
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:42,180
the uppercase letters old style numbers

530
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:43,530
are designed to sit alongside the

531
00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:45,720
lowercase letters and there they tend to

532
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:48,510
be the default in serif typefaces a good

533
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:51,630
way to remember that is the top one here

534
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:53,940
is verdana and the bottom is Georgia so

535
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:55,950
in verdana the lining numbers or the

536
00:19:55,950 --> 00:19:57,930
default and in Georgia the old style of

537
00:19:57,930 --> 00:19:59,260
a default

538
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:02,740
both designed by Matthew Carter but in

539
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:04,690
that case you know that those features

540
00:20:04,690 --> 00:20:06,790
are potentially available for you in the

541
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:09,430
typefaces even when the default is

542
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:12,640
different proportional and tabular

543
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:15,820
numbers help us align numbers vertically

544
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:17,860
rather than horizontally so if we're

545
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:19,680
setting a whole table of information

546
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,850
it's really annoying when things don't

547
00:20:21,850 --> 00:20:23,410
line up properly this makes it difficult

548
00:20:23,410 --> 00:20:26,580
for our readers to scan for information

549
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:29,110
tabular numbers are essentially

550
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:31,210
monospaced numbers that are designed to

551
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:35,260
fit in with your typeface so I've see

552
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:36,880
some people sometimes switch to just a

553
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,770
monospaced font for their tables but

554
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:40,720
this way things are preserved

555
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,400
horizontally and vertically and if

556
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,570
you're already loading in a web phone

557
00:20:43,570 --> 00:20:45,130
with tabular numbers you might as well

558
00:20:45,130 --> 00:20:49,450
use them it also applies in animation

559
00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:52,480
and user interface design when the

560
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,160
frames are stacked rather than having

561
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,420
the numbers jump around they can all

562
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:57,820
stay in place this was really bugging me

563
00:20:57,820 --> 00:20:59,440
on the plane if you're on the plane next

564
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,000
to me I guess you can have the window

565
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,620
seat apparently I'm going to be thinking

566
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:04,510
about proportional versus tabular

567
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:07,810
numbers here's a proper execution of it

568
00:21:07,810 --> 00:21:11,410
at a different airport where things are

569
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:14,260
lined up so you can use that with font

570
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:18,760
variant numeric tabular numbs and it's

571
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,290
important to remember not all typefaces

572
00:21:20,290 --> 00:21:22,150
have all these features you want to

573
00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:23,710
choose a typeface that has the feature

574
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:25,870
load the web font and then enable the

575
00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:28,810
features typefaces are different this is

576
00:21:28,810 --> 00:21:31,030
morriston by design by Riley cran I've

577
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:33,040
set the schedule here in this typeface

578
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:37,260
and I can switch to the tabular numbers

579
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:39,940
but if I switch to this typeface sq fina

580
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:42,310
also designed by Riley cran that option

581
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:44,080
isn't available that's really because

582
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,880
this is a ridiculous way to set this

583
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:48,340
table this is a typeface intended for

584
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:49,600
large display setting so it looks

585
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,070
beautiful like this but I wouldn't want

586
00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:52,720
to set a whole spreadsheet in that

587
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:55,840
typeface so open type features can

588
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,340
actually be a really good way to help

589
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:59,080
you figure out what your typeface is

590
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:01,330
good for when you're evaluating k faces

591
00:22:01,330 --> 00:22:02,710
I know that can be a challenging task

592
00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:04,210
sometimes but these features show you

593
00:22:04,210 --> 00:22:06,520
that oh this is good for setting large

594
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:08,410
tables of information or this has a

595
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:09,970
bunch of swashes which means it's

596
00:22:09,970 --> 00:22:13,529
probably more for display settings

597
00:22:13,529 --> 00:22:16,269
if you're using a web font service you

598
00:22:16,269 --> 00:22:18,429
just have to make sure that you are

599
00:22:18,429 --> 00:22:20,499
including these features when you're

600
00:22:20,499 --> 00:22:22,240
loading your web fonts or if your self

601
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,249
hosting web fonts just don't sub set

602
00:22:24,249 --> 00:22:27,249
them out there tends to be documentation

603
00:22:27,249 --> 00:22:29,320
for all of this based on whatever web

604
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:31,840
font service you're using and it it's

605
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,759
usually a simple if ticking one box but

606
00:22:33,759 --> 00:22:35,529
it differs slightly between each one but

607
00:22:35,529 --> 00:22:37,210
i'll link to those pages on on my

608
00:22:37,210 --> 00:22:40,149
website and then lastly you want to

609
00:22:40,149 --> 00:22:42,159
enable the tabular numbers in your CSS

610
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:44,169
so again you can use this library if you

611
00:22:44,169 --> 00:22:46,210
want which means then you would just

612
00:22:46,210 --> 00:22:49,090
have to apply the teen um class to your

613
00:22:49,090 --> 00:22:51,669
table and then the small caps class to

614
00:22:51,669 --> 00:22:55,210
the abbreviation here this is all

615
00:22:55,210 --> 00:22:57,340
documented with lots lots of examples on

616
00:22:57,340 --> 00:22:59,409
the site but I think it's more important

617
00:22:59,409 --> 00:23:01,809
it was more important to go through some

618
00:23:01,809 --> 00:23:03,340
examples of how this worked within

619
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:05,440
typefaces rather than get too deep into

620
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,779
the specifics of the CSS since it's

621
00:23:07,779 --> 00:23:09,249
really just the names of the features

622
00:23:09,249 --> 00:23:12,119
what's more interesting is how these

623
00:23:12,119 --> 00:23:15,659
what features these fonts actually have

624
00:23:15,659 --> 00:23:17,919
developers have frequently demystified

625
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:19,389
their craft for me including some of the

626
00:23:19,389 --> 00:23:21,369
incredible people you're going to see

627
00:23:21,369 --> 00:23:23,619
speaking here later throughout the day

628
00:23:23,619 --> 00:23:25,690
including some people who helped make

629
00:23:25,690 --> 00:23:27,700
font face of reality and someone who

630
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:29,350
wrote an amazing syntax highlighting

631
00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:32,379
library so I appreciate you having me

632
00:23:32,379 --> 00:23:33,970
here to geek out about some specific

633
00:23:33,970 --> 00:23:36,970
type of graphic details with you I hope

634
00:23:36,970 --> 00:23:38,440
you can see that typography can be just

635
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:40,600
demystified to yes you need to develop

636
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:42,999
an your eye and that takes time but you

637
00:23:42,999 --> 00:23:44,710
can also research and get excited about

638
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:45,970
the advanced typographic features

639
00:23:45,970 --> 00:23:48,039
already included within the fonts to

640
00:23:48,039 --> 00:23:50,169
help you you also know more about

641
00:23:50,169 --> 00:23:51,730
typography than you give yourself credit

642
00:23:51,730 --> 00:23:53,679
for directly through your familiarity

643
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:56,350
with principles in syntax highlighting

644
00:23:56,350 --> 00:23:58,240
these typographic conventions in code

645
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,369
and because of this when you design for

646
00:24:00,369 --> 00:24:02,200
readers i'm sure you'll syntax highlight

647
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:09,920
everything thanks

648
00:24:09,930 --> 00:24:16,360
I'm sure hello thank you so much Kenneth

649
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:17,830
I think that's a very insightful

650
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:21,430
information on typefaces and I have like

651
00:24:21,430 --> 00:24:23,140
a little bit of slight envy looking at

652
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:27,520
your slight designs so is there anyone

653
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,020
who's interested in we're going to take

654
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:31,450
a few questions so any of you has

655
00:24:31,450 --> 00:24:34,570
questions for Kenneth please raise up

656
00:24:34,570 --> 00:24:39,090
your hand cell will give you the Mike

657
00:24:39,090 --> 00:24:47,720
any questions come on questions anyone

658
00:24:47,730 --> 00:24:51,610
ok i'm going to ask your questions I'm

659
00:24:51,610 --> 00:24:53,770
curious about as someone who's

660
00:24:53,770 --> 00:24:57,040
interested in typography but I only know

661
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:59,560
one source which is google web fun I was

662
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:01,870
wondering where do you get like your

663
00:25:01,870 --> 00:25:03,790
resources when it comes to web points

664
00:25:03,790 --> 00:25:06,100
other than google web fun and yeah you

665
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:09,880
get your inspiration um I I work with

666
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:14,080
the last type co-op a lot and we have a

667
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,520
lot of typefaces that you should check

668
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:18,100
out so that's lost type calm and tebow

669
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:20,110
tech i mentioned peterby lacks typeface

670
00:25:20,110 --> 00:25:23,970
Greta sends they have an amazing catalog

671
00:25:23,970 --> 00:25:27,970
webtype is one but I think the best

672
00:25:27,970 --> 00:25:29,740
advice i really could offer you is to

673
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:31,330
check out that letter love series that's

674
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:34,720
based here in singapore it's run by an

675
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,360
amazing type designer who studied in the

676
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,220
netherlands and came back to singapore

677
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:41,320
and puts on these great events so if

678
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:42,670
you're if you're interested in type you

679
00:25:42,670 --> 00:25:44,020
should check that out and you'll find

680
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:46,060
people recommending you a lot of new

681
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:49,780
things there as well ok thank you any

682
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:53,670
questions from the audience um hi

683
00:25:53,670 --> 00:25:57,190
actually have a question about the OTF

684
00:25:57,190 --> 00:26:00,280
font format because a lot of the things

685
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:02,470
that you talked about like ligatures and

686
00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:06,670
swatches are part of the OTF font so how

687
00:26:06,670 --> 00:26:09,370
is browser support for this because

688
00:26:09,370 --> 00:26:12,670
normally when I declare font faces you

689
00:26:12,670 --> 00:26:15,520
have like all the fall backs you have

690
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:20,740
your right off to Worf's so I is it how

691
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:23,410
safe is it is it too just grab declare

692
00:26:23,410 --> 00:26:25,540
an OTF browser support is great actually

693
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:27,160
um that you brought up an important

694
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,510
point these are called open type

695
00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:30,340
features but they're not exclusive to

696
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:34,180
the opentype font format wafaa and waft

697
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:37,560
to both include open type features and

698
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:40,810
since Safari 10 came out all the major

699
00:26:40,810 --> 00:26:43,780
browsers support all the font feature or

700
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:45,160
the majority of the font feature

701
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:47,650
settings certainly for Latin based

702
00:26:47,650 --> 00:26:50,260
languages it gets a bit different for

703
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:51,940
other languages but you can also check

704
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:54,940
out state of webtype com which is like

705
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:57,400
the can I use for these features

706
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:00,550
basically but yeah you don't need to use

707
00:27:00,550 --> 00:27:02,200
opentype font formats this will all work

708
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:08,320
with woof woof to as well thanks great

709
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:14,020
questions the audience green um well if

710
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:17,050
you want to talk type Oh find me oh it's

711
00:27:17,050 --> 00:27:19,870
so yeah one last one yeah sure hi um

712
00:27:19,870 --> 00:27:23,140
first thank you so much I'm in second uh

713
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:25,300
this is really cool just because I

714
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:27,640
didn't know about open type features so

715
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:30,430
the question I had was I'm one of the

716
00:27:30,430 --> 00:27:34,150
first examples you had and you said that

717
00:27:34,150 --> 00:27:37,060
you can set font variant ligatures but

718
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:39,880
then the higher class way was the

719
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:41,980
feature settings and then you went into

720
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:45,100
about support like support I'm and I

721
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:46,810
think I missed the part where you were

722
00:27:46,810 --> 00:27:49,860
explaining why this is important or else

723
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:52,660
what would blow up if I don't do it okay

724
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:56,170
um it's not really the browser support

725
00:27:56,170 --> 00:27:58,780
for font feature settings is very good

726
00:27:58,780 --> 00:28:00,490
and if you just want to use font feature

727
00:28:00,490 --> 00:28:02,440
settings that's totally fine and that

728
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:05,890
will probably work for most cases if you

729
00:28:05,890 --> 00:28:07,960
are using a lot of open type features in

730
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,760
different ways those things won't

731
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:13,540
cascade down the document so if you set

732
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:15,190
certain open type features on the body

733
00:28:15,190 --> 00:28:17,350
you're going to have to read Eclair all

734
00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:19,750
of those on the heading so in the case

735
00:28:19,750 --> 00:28:22,300
of me writing a library to help people

736
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:23,860
with that I needed to avoid that issue

737
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:26,860
but in most situations you can just use

738
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:28,360
