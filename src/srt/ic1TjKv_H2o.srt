2
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:13,299
so I'd argue that accessibility is

3
00:00:13,299 --> 00:00:15,009
probably more important than saving

4
00:00:15,009 --> 00:00:18,480
people from fires and stuff sometimes I

5
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,739
wish I had a really good fake American

6
00:00:20,739 --> 00:00:22,930
accent just to really confuse people but

7
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:26,590
I don't so they already covered it but

8
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:29,259
this is not me I've not given up my

9
00:00:29,259 --> 00:00:32,890
acting career to become a developer the

10
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:36,760
money's not really the same this is me

11
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:40,149
I'm not too sure I always get asked

12
00:00:40,149 --> 00:00:42,399
about the other guy took this photo for

13
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:45,190
me this was done in a car park somewhere

14
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:48,249
in Perth doesn't look anything like that

15
00:00:48,249 --> 00:00:50,289
when you see the original photoshop is

16
00:00:50,289 --> 00:00:55,449
good through my talk I'll be referencing

17
00:00:55,449 --> 00:00:58,480
a couple different URLs to save you

18
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:01,390
typing stuff madly I put them all on my

19
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:04,330
tumblr so if you want to play along with

20
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:05,560
a couple of demos that I'll be going

21
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:08,350
through like this down now and you can

22
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:11,170
see exactly how bad my code is in my

23
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:13,270
flesh rather than nice bits that i show

24
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:18,970
you in my slides and i moved to

25
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:20,980
singapore a couple of years ago I was

26
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:24,130
working for this company I just left

27
00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:27,130
them one of the things I did when I

28
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:31,500
shifted here is I took on the task of

29
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:36,370
creating a global you I standard the

30
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:39,060
company I was working for jlt operate in

31
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:41,290
140 something countries around the world

32
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:46,150
we had teams just anywhere we didn't

33
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:47,800
even know how many teams that were

34
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,510
working on software for us at any given

35
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:53,320
time and there was no coherence anything

36
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:55,090
from one to another we had a logo that

37
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:57,640
was the same most of the time the colors

38
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:01,540
weren't any sense of you I was just lost

39
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:03,940
and branding was lost between the

40
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:05,530
different divisions and outsourced

41
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:08,739
companies and everything so stupidly I

42
00:02:08,739 --> 00:02:11,769
decided to do this myself I had no

43
00:02:11,769 --> 00:02:14,980
actual support really I don't recommend

44
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:15,500
doing

45
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:20,750
get help I should note actually before I

46
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:22,910
go further I don't work at the company

47
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:24,920
anymore I don't know if anyone's

48
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:27,050
actually maintaining this project all

49
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:29,240
the code is on github so you can grab it

50
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,490
and look at it how if you like but no

51
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:32,990
guarantees about how long it's going to

52
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:38,540
be there and I set out following the

53
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:40,580
programmers credo we do things because

54
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:43,280
we think they are easy not because we

55
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,720
they're easy because we thought they'll

56
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:49,190
going to be easy and classic avoidance

57
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:51,440
behavior the first thing I did setting

58
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:55,970
out to create a UI style guide was to

59
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:58,310
look into architecture because that's

60
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:02,780
exactly where you go this piece of

61
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:05,900
architecture is called the Strand this

62
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:09,320
was designed by Arthur Ericsson and it's

63
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:14,959
in robson square in vancouver erickson

64
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:18,380
followed the design philosophies of the

65
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:20,720
universal design and the idea of

66
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,209
universal design is that you build

67
00:03:23,209 --> 00:03:25,910
something and it's just inherently able

68
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:28,730
to be used by everyone so you've got a

69
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:31,519
set of stairs where's the ramp well the

70
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:34,310
ramp is in the stairs that's just how

71
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:36,230
you do a ramp and how you do stairs

72
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:38,870
there's nothing no special accordance

73
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:40,880
made for anyone here this is just good

74
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:45,530
design and the ideas of universal design

75
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:49,400
are to make things equitable so

76
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,880
regardless of individual abilities

77
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:54,350
something will just work you don't have

78
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:59,470
to have legs in order to get up the ramp

79
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:03,380
needs to be flexible so irrespective of

80
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:05,630
how someone wants to use it it'll just

81
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:09,440
work William Gibson has a saying on this

82
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:11,120
like the street finds its own use for

83
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,790
things when we design a product that's

84
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:16,400
good anyone can pick it up and just use

85
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:17,810
it the way they want to they don't have

86
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:20,810
to read a manual it should just work in

87
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:23,150
a way that makes sense this is very

88
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:25,070
difficult of course but this is what we

89
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:27,380
aim towards

90
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:30,140
design should be simple and intuitive

91
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:34,040
they should make sense without anyone

92
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:38,600
having to explain what goes on this is

93
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,310
one of those things that's really easy

94
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:42,680
to discuss but it's really hard to do in

95
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,720
practice because what makes sense to

96
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,930
people changes over time my son is five

97
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:49,400
years old if I give him a touch

98
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:52,520
interface he's got no problem with it if

99
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,800
I give a touch interface to someone I

100
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,450
mean first iPhone ship with a manual

101
00:04:56,450 --> 00:04:58,550
because Apple weren't sure that people

102
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:00,740
would know what to do with the thing now

103
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:02,450
we think is touch and we talk about is a

104
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:05,050
really intuitive way of doing UI design

105
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:08,660
but there's nothing really in inherently

106
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:10,820
intuitive about anything it we just have

107
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:14,150
to get into the social understanding of

108
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:18,740
how people do things so expectations

109
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:20,930
will change over time in essence so

110
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:23,840
what's simple intuitive to us now wasn't

111
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,760
for someone 100 years ago for example

112
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:29,730
and won't be for some 100 years from now

113
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:32,750
design should be perceptible if you

114
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:37,130
can't see it it's not there humans

115
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:39,770
develop object permanence around eight

116
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:41,510
months with young babies you can do

117
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:43,310
peekaboo that's really exciting because

118
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:45,410
you've disappeared when your hands are

119
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:49,460
in front of your eyes like wow with

120
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:51,860
interfaces it's exactly the same thing

121
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:53,960
if you can't see it if you've got a

122
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:56,060
something that shows up only on hover

123
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:58,640
it's not there so I might find it by

124
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,620
accident but if thats content that

125
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:03,260
someone needs to actually consume then

126
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:06,200
it's not going to be read this is one of

127
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,240
the big arguments against carousels for

128
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,670
example and because the rates for

129
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:12,500
carousels no one basically gets past the

130
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,900
first slide that I don't read it so when

131
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:16,790
someone insists on a carousel we say are

132
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:18,890
you happy that ninety-eight percent of

133
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:20,720
your viewers won't see anything past the

134
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,850
first thing if they are that's fine let

135
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:26,750
them pay the penalty design should be

136
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:30,290
tolerant and I've done a lot of work on

137
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:32,810
forms in the past and when you see

138
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:35,330
videos of testing with forms and you see

139
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:36,770
people crying because they get an error

140
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:40,520
message you understand the impact of

141
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:43,250
you doing to people let people make

142
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:48,800
mistakes let them fail in a way that's

143
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:53,389
gentle don't let them just fall and cry

144
00:06:53,389 --> 00:06:55,699
because that's what happens it's one of

145
00:06:55,699 --> 00:06:57,229
the problems in our industries is we

146
00:06:57,229 --> 00:06:58,699
never really see the people at the other

147
00:06:58,699 --> 00:07:01,370
end of the screen but keep that in your

148
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:02,810
mind when you're doing it someone's

149
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:04,550
going to have a great deal of difficulty

150
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:06,199
with this unless I think about it a bit

151
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:11,449
better design should be low effort you

152
00:07:11,449 --> 00:07:17,210
shouldn't have to like do gymnastics on

153
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:19,699
the keyboard to do a keyboard shortcut

154
00:07:19,699 --> 00:07:22,940
if you any Photoshop users with the the

155
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:24,680
export command it's absolutely

156
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:27,380
disgusting and the guy who came up with

157
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:29,150
it thought no one was going to use it so

158
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:31,400
he you have to like use a couple of

159
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,319
hands and I think your nose just to get

160
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:36,199
the the key commands right he's written

161
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:38,599
a blog post apologizing sense that you

162
00:07:38,599 --> 00:07:41,240
know if they thought about a bit better

163
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:45,199
it might have been nicer the sign needs

164
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:48,050
to be appropriate for the size and space

165
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:52,400
regarded in dividual abilities having a

166
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,639
five-year-old and a boy I'm acutely

167
00:07:55,639 --> 00:07:57,830
aware of how well-designed urinals are

168
00:07:57,830 --> 00:07:59,659
in toilets because you go into them you

169
00:07:59,659 --> 00:08:01,580
get the ones that are really tall and he

170
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:03,349
can walk in there there's no problem you

171
00:08:03,349 --> 00:08:04,969
get the ones where the height is up here

172
00:08:04,969 --> 00:08:07,270
I have to hold him so we can go later

173
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:10,039
just a simple design of having it work

174
00:08:10,039 --> 00:08:12,080
for everyone adults can walk in they use

175
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,060
it doesn't make a difference little boys

176
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:17,630
can walk in and it's fine when you don't

177
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:19,900
use Universal Design then you notice

178
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:24,710
basically on a similar note I wasn't

179
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:26,539
really as appreciative as I could have

180
00:08:26,539 --> 00:08:30,279
been until I had a a pram or stroller

181
00:08:30,279 --> 00:08:33,260
and when you've got wheels and you need

182
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:35,000
to navigate through something then you

183
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,099
really appreciate how good ramps are and

184
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:38,899
lists and things like that otherwise

185
00:08:38,899 --> 00:08:40,370
you'll just walk through life and not

186
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:42,050
really notice that much until you hurt

187
00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:46,310
your foot or something to setting out to

188
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:50,180
build a framework this tells you a lot

189
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:53,120
about my own personality but I went with

190
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,130
no dependents

191
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:56,260
I didn't want any history any baggage

192
00:08:56,260 --> 00:09:00,550
anything to hold me back my rationale

193
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:06,280
behind that is that I don't want to like

194
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,690
fail because someone else has written

195
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:09,730
something bad that's going to break and

196
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:11,740
I don't know what it does I won't have

197
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:14,140
some idea of what's actually going on so

198
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:16,210
the way to do that is pretty simple you

199
00:09:16,210 --> 00:09:18,280
take bootstrap jquery all your different

200
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:22,570
libraries and throw them in the bin I've

201
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:25,030
got so many people who use bootstrap and

202
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:28,750
they hate it really it's taking my

203
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:31,920
opportunity again to bag bootstrap

204
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,120
there's nothing really in there that you

205
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:36,160
can't do yourself you just have to

206
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:39,640
really have a go the scariest thing out

207
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:42,220
of this was throwing out jquery I mean

208
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:44,260
I've been writing JavaScript since it

209
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:48,990
was released in 96-97 whenever it was I

210
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:53,530
became a fully fledged jquery friend or

211
00:09:53,530 --> 00:09:57,250
something along those lines and you

212
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:59,590
don't need it anymore you've got element

213
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:01,450
query selector and query select all

214
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:03,670
that's most of what jQuery does for you

215
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:05,920
you can live without it let go of the

216
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,360
tethers and your life will be much

217
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:12,340
happier the first thing setting out to

218
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:14,920
create a library and following universal

219
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:17,080
design was to make sure accessibility it

220
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:19,480
was a key that meant diving into the

221
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:23,140
Aria roles I thought this was going to

222
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:25,150
be a lot harder than it was I had a

223
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:27,520
pretty good idea of how Aria things work

224
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:30,310
because I care about that anyway but

225
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:31,990
creating this library I wanted to make

226
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:34,450
every single component of it completely

227
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:37,530
accessible no excuses every line of code

228
00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:39,610
everything that's rendered must be

229
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:41,230
accessible to everyone to the fullest

230
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:45,880
possible standard so it meant reading a

231
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:49,630
lot of documentation there were the good

232
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:51,280
things out of this is it's changed how I

233
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:55,150
code so instead of I've got my bem

234
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:59,110
syntax here where I've got a tab and

235
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:01,600
I've got my selected state when you use

236
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,120
the Aria components you don't need

237
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:06,040
anything else it actually gives you the

238
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,840
syntax that makes a whole lot more sense

239
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:10,420
in there and it's easy to understand

240
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:11,800
someone else's code when you're eating

241
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,780
this you can see right away Aria

242
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:15,790
selected is true you know what the state

243
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:17,800
of that component is it gives you a

244
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:20,590
JavaScript selector it gives you obsess

245
00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:23,410
s if you need to do anything with

246
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:25,720
JavaScript it does all the work for you

247
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:29,140
this is pretty awesome and most of these

248
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:30,580
things have just been sitting there and

249
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:33,970
get ignored a bit but Aria pays off

250
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:35,470
really quickly even if you don't care

251
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:37,630
about accessibility just by following

252
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:39,790
the standards you get all these freebies

253
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:43,680
which is really nice and then again with

254
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,920
setting attributes through JavaScript

255
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:49,360
it's really clear what this code does

256
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,250
you don't really need to explain to

257
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:52,810
anyone what you doing you don't have a

258
00:11:52,810 --> 00:11:55,990
half a custom class or anything thats

259
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:57,910
all i needs to understand how your CSS

260
00:11:57,910 --> 00:11:59,920
works to work out how to set of selected

261
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:05,260
state or some other state when i first

262
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:07,900
got into this i got a bit crazy and did

263
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:11,190
things like this and don't do that

264
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:13,590
there's already hidden display none

265
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:15,640
slightly yeah if it's hidden I don't

266
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:17,440
want to show it on the screen right but

267
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,180
then you want to animate something and

268
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:21,430
it's display none so you can't do that

269
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:25,630
anymore so I quickly learnt to use like

270
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:28,630
name spacing in essence where you just

271
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:30,070
attach it to a class that's already

272
00:12:30,070 --> 00:12:33,040
there then you've got the flexibility to

273
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,380
do things how you want I saw recently

274
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:39,670
Hayden Pickering suggested one of the

275
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:43,800
other area pseudo classes or selectors

276
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:47,530
you do in a universal so ignored what

277
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:49,560
I'm telling you in that regard that

278
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,940
generally speaking just be careful when

279
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:57,050
you when you're getting into this stuff

280
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:59,680
the first thing you'll want to do is

281
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:03,070
really dive into the documentation and

282
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:06,340
if you've looked at w3c documentation

283
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:09,160
it's pretty scary I mean look how

284
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:11,920
attractive this this design is really

285
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:19,550
once you make it once you've read it

286
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:23,440
fortunately I'm not the first person to

287
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:27,040
ever have done this so i mentioned

288
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,720
Hayden Pickering before he's got some

289
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,260
really awesome examples of UI components

290
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:33,640
you can just grab them exactly as they

291
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:35,080
are and pop them into your projects if

292
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:37,660
you like otherwise read his code work

293
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:40,170
out how it operates and its really good

294
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:43,330
w3c documentation does have examples

295
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:46,810
some of them a bit wrong which is why

296
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:48,550
it's a good idea to go a bit further and

297
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:51,070
find what you're doing and the thing

298
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:53,050
that you need to do is you know you need

299
00:13:53,050 --> 00:13:56,800
tabs in a site so just Google Aria tabs

300
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,470
and get your examples from that it's not

301
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:01,930
hard just add Aria to your google search

302
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:03,790
and your life will be a whole lot easier

303
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:06,340
and everyone using your product will be

304
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:12,280
happier as well leah is right here this

305
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:17,260
is her work Thank You Leah I needed to

306
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:20,860
create a hierarchical picker we had some

307
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:23,470
really complex data and we needed a way

308
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:25,210
for people to select things we had

309
00:14:25,210 --> 00:14:27,700
basically really deep nested business

310
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:32,200
units parent company local region office

311
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,600
office locations in a city it was just

312
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:37,000
crazy crazy trying to work it out and

313
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,160
the you is that was there before I got

314
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:40,540
onto the project with pretty horrendous

315
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:43,000
there are about five steps for anyone to

316
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,100
get through to select something so I

317
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:46,960
grabbed awesome fleet which is as

318
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:49,960
awesome as the name suggests I mean it's

319
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:53,550
2k and you've got a fully accessible by

320
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:58,330
use this thing everyone you don't need

321
00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:02,920
bootstrap when you've got this it's this

322
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:07,780
is my code I was going to do a live demo

323
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:09,760
but for some reason keynote hates me at

324
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,890
the moment so I'm just doing this live

325
00:15:11,890 --> 00:15:17,350
version instead this is a hierarchical

326
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:19,210
picker that when you start typing it

327
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:21,790
will select things for you this

328
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:24,190
structure is taking a tree view from the

329
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:26,800
REO recommendations so all the

330
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,170
accessibility of a treeview nested in

331
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:31,720
with the recommendations of how a

332
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:35,649
auto complete works so when you have

333
00:15:35,649 --> 00:15:37,569
custom controls you don't have to just

334
00:15:37,569 --> 00:15:39,699
say well it's not in the Aria spectrum

335
00:15:39,699 --> 00:15:43,420
who needs accessibility just chop and

336
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:45,550
change what's in there and it makes

337
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:47,620
sense after a while it's not too hard to

338
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:51,009
wrap your head around it so the idea of

339
00:15:51,009 --> 00:15:52,600
this one is you can very quickly select

340
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:56,079
what you want and then navigate down the

341
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:58,269
tree without having to know what it's

342
00:15:58,269 --> 00:15:59,949
doing if you don't want to type you can

343
00:15:59,949 --> 00:16:01,480
still navigate through the tree because

344
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:04,990
it's a fully accessible tree view so you

345
00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:07,689
get both things at once which is great

346
00:16:07,689 --> 00:16:10,439
this is a demo so it doesn't look pretty

347
00:16:10,439 --> 00:16:12,610
never went to production because I left

348
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:14,110
the company before anything happen with

349
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:15,790
it but the code is there is this thing

350
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:23,019
does work you can't read that I can't

351
00:16:23,019 --> 00:16:27,310
read that that's getting this is a huge

352
00:16:27,310 --> 00:16:29,290
screen so my examples a little bit lost

353
00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:33,100
but you meant to write it by now one of

354
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:35,379
the keys like Aria roles are any part of

355
00:16:35,379 --> 00:16:37,980
accessibility making things obvious is

356
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:42,160
really important accessibility we talk

357
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,899
about usually in a very narrow range

358
00:16:43,899 --> 00:16:46,360
where we say that here's the area stuff

359
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:49,180
you you follow the add the attributes

360
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:51,279
and you're done but it's not just that

361
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:53,769
and this is really going back to

362
00:16:53,769 --> 00:16:55,860
universal design making things

363
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:57,879
intuitive's that you can actually work

364
00:16:57,879 --> 00:17:01,509
out what you're doing so the universal

365
00:17:01,509 --> 00:17:03,879
design principles here are simple and

366
00:17:03,879 --> 00:17:06,220
intuitive perceptible low-effort rise

367
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:08,709
right size and space and that's wrapped

368
00:17:08,709 --> 00:17:15,069
uppers make it obvious this is Google's

369
00:17:15,069 --> 00:17:20,350
recommendation for touch sizing and this

370
00:17:20,350 --> 00:17:21,720
is really what you need to know about

371
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,890
buttons and interactive elements

372
00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:25,480
basically you need to make them big

373
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,850
enough before touchscreens became a

374
00:17:27,850 --> 00:17:30,159
thing usually we were worried about

375
00:17:30,159 --> 00:17:32,080
something that you could generally reach

376
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,600
with a mouse with touch we've got these

377
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:38,470
things which are really clumsy at you I

378
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:41,500
interaction and the research has been

379
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:44,230
done that we know that based on a

380
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:45,070
certain pixel

381
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:47,350
you can make something big enough that I

382
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:49,420
can tap it with my finger without having

383
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:52,510
to be worried about it people use this

384
00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:54,550
in dark patterns or I don't know if

385
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:55,900
they're actually intentionally being

386
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:58,720
evil or if they're just ignorant but

387
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,550
you'll see pop-up ads on mobile where

388
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:02,440
it's got a tiny little X and it makes

389
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:05,130
you actually click on the add instead

390
00:18:05,130 --> 00:18:07,630
but if you love your users and you do

391
00:18:07,630 --> 00:18:12,040
because you're here at CSS conf Apple

392
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:14,530
and Google recommend a minimum 24 pixels

393
00:18:14,530 --> 00:18:17,430
for an interaction target so 24 by 24

394
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:21,190
microsoft recommends 26 pick one go with

395
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:24,090
it and at least things will be better

396
00:18:24,090 --> 00:18:26,590
when you're getting into really tight

397
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:29,410
you eyes and even but I'm desktop this

398
00:18:29,410 --> 00:18:30,880
makes things easier if you're using a

399
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,150
mouse it's easier to click on the thing

400
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:34,960
regardless of how you're interacting

401
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:38,470
with your device making elements or

402
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:40,630
interactive elements larger makes them

403
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:48,160
better color contrasts usually see as an

404
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,450
issue Harrow plate when you get your

405
00:18:49,450 --> 00:18:51,930
eyes tested when you're younger or

406
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:54,310
something that you might encounter color

407
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:58,570
blindness and the whole point of initial

408
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:01,180
haro plate is some colors don't really

409
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:02,890
gel very well with each other and

410
00:19:02,890 --> 00:19:08,410
contrast don't work very well really the

411
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:10,420
cure load when you read into how color

412
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:13,150
blindness affects people the way to fix

413
00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:15,460
it is to ensure that the elements have

414
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:18,600
enough contrast from each other so that

415
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,620
irrespective of being able to perceive

416
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:22,870
the colors you can still tell the

417
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:24,760
difference so anyone who's colorblind

418
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:27,490
along the wrong spectrum or right

419
00:19:27,490 --> 00:19:29,560
spectrum will have trouble reading this

420
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,630
this is hard to read anyway even if you

421
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:33,700
do have perfect color vision because the

422
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:37,020
contrast is intentionally difficult

423
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:39,610
fortunately getting the w3c have done

424
00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:43,990
the work for us they recommend contrast

425
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:46,720
ratios for 21 or four and a half to one

426
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,730
for small text at less than 20 points

427
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:51,730
and three two one for anything from 20

428
00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:55,390
and up so that's great you know what to

429
00:19:55,390 --> 00:19:57,010
do the problem is how to actually test

430
00:19:57,010 --> 00:19:57,870
for it

431
00:19:57,870 --> 00:20:00,120
the good thing is there are some really

432
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:01,860
good browser plug-ins this is the one in

433
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:05,580
Firefox this is the WCAG contrast

434
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:09,690
checker I have it alt see I hit and it

435
00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:11,070
just comes up and you can test things

436
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:14,250
really quickly fortunately the w3c site

437
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:17,280
passes the contrast checker partly

438
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,230
because they're designers so bland that

439
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:23,190
you know here hope it does you can see

440
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:25,950
up here that the the contrast ratio is

441
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:28,200
there the luminosity so it shows you

442
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:31,830
exactly what passes and what fails it

443
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:33,330
gets a bit more complex when you're

444
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:35,400
dealing with background images and most

445
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:39,530
checkers don't do this very well because

446
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:42,030
when you have a variable background do

447
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:43,530
you need to basically measure every part

448
00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:47,670
of it this site actually let's that lets

449
00:20:47,670 --> 00:20:49,380
he do it so you can put an image in

450
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:51,030
there you can put the text on top and

451
00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:53,190
I'll tell you whether or not it is going

452
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:56,190
to pass or not the difficult thing is

453
00:20:56,190 --> 00:20:57,900
when you're first starting out doing

454
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:00,750
color contrast properly is getting into

455
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:02,970
the rhythm of it because designers don't

456
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:04,350
have very good tools for actually

457
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:07,350
measuring contrast so what you really

458
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:09,660
need to do is talk to your designers

459
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:12,030
frequently when they give you something

460
00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:14,850
test it out and see and talk to them and

461
00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:16,320
show you them and work out what the

462
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:19,140
answer is going to be once you get used

463
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:21,059
to how contrasts work you'll be able to

464
00:21:21,059 --> 00:21:23,850
see what is a good contrast or not

465
00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:25,920
without having to do a test I mean you

466
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:28,440
still test anyway to confirm but when

467
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:30,059
you get into the habit of it and becomes

468
00:21:30,059 --> 00:21:32,190
much easier it's certainly difficult at

469
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:34,050
first and especially so for designers

470
00:21:34,050 --> 00:21:39,300
because the tools are just lacking but

471
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:41,960
color contrast is more complex than that

472
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:45,000
this is a blog posts from Ryan Fredrik

473
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:50,280
at Shopify and they started looking at

474
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:52,640
the ratios and they're fixed ratios and

475
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:56,190
humans are not robots where organic

476
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:57,990
creatures we see the green spectrum

477
00:21:57,990 --> 00:22:00,720
particularly well we perceive other

478
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:03,420
colors better or worse according to what

479
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:05,240
we're designed to do in nature and that

480
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:08,390
means you get things like this where

481
00:22:08,390 --> 00:22:11,490
we've got a failure over on the left

482
00:22:11,490 --> 00:22:13,770
and a success over on the right yet

483
00:22:13,770 --> 00:22:16,200
perceptively the one on the left is

484
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,450
probably a little that's your right

485
00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:23,010
anyway the white text is somewhat better

486
00:22:23,010 --> 00:22:26,100
to read in certain circumstances so the

487
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:27,990
algorithm itself is not quite enough

488
00:22:27,990 --> 00:22:30,240
like the simplicity of what the w3c are

489
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:35,580
doing isn't necessarily perfect and the

490
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:37,410
Shopify team looked into this further

491
00:22:37,410 --> 00:22:41,250
and they found a 1992 highway manual

492
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:44,070
talking about the legibility of signage

493
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:46,380
and they've done the research there are

494
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:48,840
there's maths I'm sorry to introduce

495
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:52,740
maths in the morning but this actually

496
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:55,559
shows that the white on red is more

497
00:22:55,559 --> 00:23:00,630
perceptible for for human interaction

498
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:04,320
basically than the black on red even

499
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,540
though it's the other way around when

500
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:08,760
you use a simple formula so if you're

501
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:11,130
getting into this and you're really sure

502
00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:12,720
that your color looks good even though

503
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:17,360
the w3c tool tells you otherwise then

504
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:19,559
dive a bit deeper and you can come up

505
00:23:19,559 --> 00:23:27,250
with some really interesting designs

506
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:33,270
buttons annoy me greatly when iOS 7 came

507
00:23:33,270 --> 00:23:35,309
around everything went flat and flat

508
00:23:35,309 --> 00:23:36,840
meant that we don't know what we're

509
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:40,400
clicking on on interacting with any more

510
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,960
google followed suit with material if

511
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:45,809
you use later and we've got our three

512
00:23:45,809 --> 00:23:48,330
buttons that this one's all right middle

513
00:23:48,330 --> 00:23:50,970
one you can see it's button e the one on

514
00:23:50,970 --> 00:23:53,400
the end what is that like is that just

515
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:56,850
text on the screen how I meant to know

516
00:23:56,850 --> 00:23:58,380
whether I meant to interact with that or

517
00:23:58,380 --> 00:23:59,970
not I'm just going to leave that alone

518
00:23:59,970 --> 00:24:01,740
and not touch it because it might do

519
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:04,230
something bad this is a really really

520
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:09,030
bad trend and we frequently follow like

521
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:10,650
humans of pack animals we follow

522
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:12,300
everyone else's example of what to do

523
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:13,860
Google write something Apple write

524
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:15,420
something we just do exactly what they

525
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:18,830
do without question but this is not good

526
00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:21,600
because there's nothing inviting about

527
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:24,390
that button there's nothing to tell me

528
00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:25,020
to make it

529
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:27,650
obvious you can get context within

530
00:24:27,650 --> 00:24:29,910
positioning on the screen and certain

531
00:24:29,910 --> 00:24:33,090
habits will form but there's nothing

532
00:24:33,090 --> 00:24:36,230
inherently button II about it

533
00:24:36,230 --> 00:24:38,460
fortunately with a lot of open source

534
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:40,260
style guides lately we've got some

535
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:43,350
really good examples of what to do the

536
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:45,390
really basic level is you need some

537
00:24:45,390 --> 00:24:47,220
outline around the target so I know how

538
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:49,680
big the thing is am I going to tap over

539
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:51,720
here or there or where when you've got a

540
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,460
border you know exactly what you're in

541
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:56,400
for it makes it much easier to interact

542
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:59,100
with something this is from the US

543
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:02,160
government web design standards I

544
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:04,890
haven't looked at the site since Trump

545
00:25:04,890 --> 00:25:08,040
was passed it's probably all in flames

546
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:11,760
at the moment I don't know there are

547
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,380
lots of good examples of what to do with

548
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:17,640
buttons out there keyboard access this

549
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:19,860
is something that gets neglected quite a

550
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:24,910
lot because it requires some effort

551
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,940
fortunately the efforts not that much

552
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:28,650
usually for keyboard access of UI

553
00:25:28,650 --> 00:25:31,110
controls you need tab enter an arrow

554
00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:33,720
keys or space as well you don't really

555
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:35,340
need to do all that much and once you've

556
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:36,900
written it for one control you can

557
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:39,240
coffee those patterns and might using a

558
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:41,220
library and reuse it everywhere else as

559
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:44,760
well fortunately we live in a world

560
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:46,830
where run shares everything Remy chef

561
00:25:46,830 --> 00:25:51,900
has done the work for you I thought tabs

562
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:54,510
how hard can tabs be tabs can be very

563
00:25:54,510 --> 00:25:58,560
hard so Remi wrote this article how tab

564
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:00,930
should work when I look through it it

565
00:26:00,930 --> 00:26:02,970
didn't quite do everything that I wanted

566
00:26:02,970 --> 00:26:06,150
to so grabbed his code and modified it

567
00:26:06,150 --> 00:26:08,700
I've got a blog post that says how tab

568
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:11,250
should really work but I'm not Remy

569
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:15,360
sharp so you haven't read it before this

570
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,160
is my code example of the tabs that I

571
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:19,320
wrote again this is demos here we're at

572
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:23,250
CSS conferred most CSS is minimal really

573
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:27,270
bad I basically done enough to show how

574
00:26:27,270 --> 00:26:30,030
things are interoperable here and no

575
00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:32,700
further than that so this is when the

576
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:36,000
page first loads sometimes you'll see

577
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,130
can't handle multiple sets of tabs on

578
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:38,360
the

579
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:40,430
green or so come on learn how to use

580
00:26:40,430 --> 00:26:43,460
javascript properly so here I've

581
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:47,870
selected the second tab I've now got

582
00:26:47,870 --> 00:26:50,810
focus on the second tab my contrast is

583
00:26:50,810 --> 00:26:52,640
really bad I'm sorry so you probably

584
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:55,370
can't see that very well and this is

585
00:26:55,370 --> 00:26:57,110
where the keyboard now basically kicks

586
00:26:57,110 --> 00:27:00,800
in and then I can use arrow keys and

587
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:04,490
there to navigate between tabs which is

588
00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:08,090
really good so we'll pause and reflect

589
00:27:08,090 --> 00:27:11,120
with a kitten for a moment because up to

590
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:12,080
hear you've basically done everything

591
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:15,620
which is great but once you've reached

592
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:17,870
this point you need to think that little

593
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:20,390
bit further which is to make sure you

594
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:23,000
don't mess with the environment that

595
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,180
you're in when we're writing things at a

596
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:28,190
custom if using a form control like I

597
00:27:28,190 --> 00:27:30,440
select it's built into the browser the

598
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,870
behavior behaviors are non when you

599
00:27:32,870 --> 00:27:35,510
write something on your own then you

600
00:27:35,510 --> 00:27:37,340
need to bring it up to that standard or

601
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:39,620
don't ship it and that means you need to

602
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:42,130
respect everything that the browser does

603
00:27:42,130 --> 00:27:44,300
what you need to do is be able to go

604
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:45,920
backward and forward in a browser

605
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:49,100
without stings stuffing up I should be

606
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:51,530
able to hit a hash somewhere in the URL

607
00:27:51,530 --> 00:27:54,620
without it breaking angular or any

608
00:27:54,620 --> 00:28:00,500
javascript libraries angel is bad even

609
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:02,330
react did this early on where if you

610
00:28:02,330 --> 00:28:04,970
have at two hashes in the urologist it

611
00:28:04,970 --> 00:28:06,680
kills the framework which it stops the

612
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:08,720
rendering they've fixed it angular is

613
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:13,310
kind of catching up but anyway you need

614
00:28:13,310 --> 00:28:15,200
to be able to refresh the page and the

615
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,880
tab i selected last time is still

616
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:19,310
selected by it why can't these things

617
00:28:19,310 --> 00:28:23,240
just be done but it's not that hard most

618
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:26,120
of how this works is but in this

619
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:27,860
particular instance you can refresh it

620
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:29,510
and a tab stays oh there's an API for

621
00:28:29,510 --> 00:28:31,580
that it's the storage API that's been

622
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:33,170
there for a while no one really knows

623
00:28:33,170 --> 00:28:36,230
about it but it takes care of a lot of

624
00:28:36,230 --> 00:28:38,360
the problems that we usually have with

625
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:41,050
remembering things filling out a form

626
00:28:41,050 --> 00:28:44,030
you get an error it reloads the page and

627
00:28:44,030 --> 00:28:45,290
everything you've filled out it's gone

628
00:28:45,290 --> 00:28:48,470
because no one knows how to do this but

629
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:50,030
storage lets you do all of that on the

630
00:28:50,030 --> 00:28:51,140
client side without a pro

631
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:55,250
it's really really powerful but the

632
00:28:55,250 --> 00:28:57,610
essence of it is to make sure you don't

633
00:28:57,610 --> 00:29:00,980
kill what sorry there you maintain the

634
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:03,040
standards of what things should do and

635
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:06,110
it's not good enough to say that oh I

636
00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:07,730
know everyone's going to have JavaScript

637
00:29:07,730 --> 00:29:10,700
turned on so you know it's all going to

638
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:12,560
be fine all my users have got perfect

639
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:14,920
vision I've asked them it's all right

640
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:17,120
you need to actually think that little

641
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:19,520
bit further and it's really what

642
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:22,790
Universal Design is about is building

643
00:29:22,790 --> 00:29:24,290
things for everyone anyway because

644
00:29:24,290 --> 00:29:25,940
that's just the better way of doing

645
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:29,120
things a lot of accessibility talks use

646
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:30,740
a lot of stick where they're just

647
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:32,750
telling you a bad person if you don't do

648
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:33,950
this thing I'm trying to give you a

649
00:29:33,950 --> 00:29:36,020
carrot here to make you feel better

650
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:38,750
about just making your code better the

651
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:40,790
fact it's accessible and people get to

652
00:29:40,790 --> 00:29:43,070
use it is a bonus it's just a better

653
00:29:43,070 --> 00:29:46,810
quality product that you'll be producing

654
00:29:46,810 --> 00:29:51,800
and universal design has gone into other

655
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:54,590
fields this is a whole range of

656
00:29:54,590 --> 00:29:56,750
prototype peelers and finished products

657
00:29:56,750 --> 00:29:58,970
that were the first product from ox 0

658
00:29:58,970 --> 00:30:02,240
and Sam Farber founder noticed that his

659
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:05,180
wife feels quite athletic and had

660
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:08,030
trouble using a kitchen peeler and it

661
00:30:08,030 --> 00:30:10,040
was like well that's not good and he

662
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:11,540
went to the shop and there was nothing

663
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:14,510
he could find that did the job so he

664
00:30:14,510 --> 00:30:17,030
iterated through several designs and got

665
00:30:17,030 --> 00:30:19,370
her to test it out and this is designed

666
00:30:19,370 --> 00:30:22,460
only for his wife I've got oxide product

667
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:24,590
so I had no idea about this until I

668
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:26,090
actually looked into it I just thought

669
00:30:26,090 --> 00:30:28,370
they were really well designed and

670
00:30:28,370 --> 00:30:30,940
that's the essence of what this is about

671
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:34,630
making your products fit into the

672
00:30:34,630 --> 00:30:37,160
philosophies of universal design will

673
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:39,470
make a better products inherently even

674
00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:42,230
for people who don't have any special

675
00:30:42,230 --> 00:30:48,560
needs so go forth with your inspiration

676
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:50,630
that you too can create a better kitchen

677
00:30:50,630 --> 00:30:54,950
pillar regardless of how strange your UI

678
00:30:54,950 --> 00:30:59,330
might be and your work will be a whole

679
00:30:59,330 --> 00:31:01,400
lot better thank you

680
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:03,910
[Music]

681
00:31:03,910 --> 00:31:08,520
[Applause]

682
00:31:08,530 --> 00:31:12,470
all right I do thank you so much Chris

683
00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:14,030
that was an amazing talk on web

684
00:31:14,030 --> 00:31:16,550
accessibility so do any of you have any

685
00:31:16,550 --> 00:31:21,230
questions for Chris Zell will be giving

686
00:31:21,230 --> 00:31:24,230
out the microphone has anyone want to

687
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:30,530
know about kitchen peelers yeah the

688
00:31:30,530 --> 00:31:32,540
highway signs thing you had with the

689
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:34,580
leave it on for a bit the contrast

690
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:36,230
levels what were the numbers being used

691
00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:37,790
in that was it because you're using some

692
00:31:37,790 --> 00:31:39,380
color numbering system that I wasn't

693
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:41,030
familiar with so maybe I can talk about

694
00:31:41,030 --> 00:31:42,680
after that but if you could share a bit

695
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:44,480
more about it i'll be helpful yeah if

696
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,760
you it's on the Shopify article actually

697
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:51,080
linked to that highway manual I can jump

698
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:56,030
back in the slides no I can't jump back

699
00:31:56,030 --> 00:32:00,530
30 sides there we go I can't actually

700
00:32:00,530 --> 00:32:06,170
remember the intent behind this is the

701
00:32:06,170 --> 00:32:07,820
highway manuals quite detailed into

702
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:09,560
reflection of services and different

703
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:10,820
things like that that they take into

704
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:13,580
account but the whole point of this is

705
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:15,860
not just as simple as a straightforward

706
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:22,730
color contrast right thank you anyone

707
00:32:22,730 --> 00:32:29,530
has any more questions for Chris anyone

708
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:34,090
what color should your kitchen tea lovie

709
00:32:34,090 --> 00:32:37,040
all right then thank you so much Chris

710
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:38,540
okay can you please give another round

711
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:40,460
of applause for Chris

712
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:48,669
[Applause]
