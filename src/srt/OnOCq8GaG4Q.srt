00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:09,929

thank you hello I'm really excited to be

2
00:00:09,929 --> 00:00:15,150
here and Budapest and to talk about the

3
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:17,850
World Wide Web and all of those things I

4
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:19,939
have heard a ton of languages spoken

5
00:00:19,939 --> 00:00:22,140
yesterday which is really exciting for

6
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:25,830
me and quick intro my name is Kat Cote

7
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:28,470
I'm actually no longer at BuzzFeed I

8
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:31,230
work at a startup called ribbon in New

9
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:33,840
York City where I'm a product engineer I

10
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,420
used to be a product manager and

11
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:38,010
although my I've worked in tech for a

12
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:39,510
couple years now my background is

13
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:41,399
actually in anthropology which is the

14
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:44,340
study of human societies biology

15
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:48,809
evolution culture and so like Steve Jobs

16
00:00:48,809 --> 00:00:52,829
I like to think about systems of people

17
00:00:52,829 --> 00:00:55,440
and now in my job I think about systems

18
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,620
of code and logic and I think that

19
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:00,899
understanding people is the key to

20
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:04,199
building good software products and now

21
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:06,180
that I'm an engineer I think it's also a

22
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:08,369
really important part of architect and

23
00:01:08,369 --> 00:01:10,619
software the right way and that's kind

24
00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:12,119
of the crux of what this talk is about

25
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:16,170
I'm gonna see if this clicker works so

26
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:18,299
the this talk is about the web norms of

27
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:20,070
the world it's it's based on the premise

28
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:22,380
that the web is different around the

29
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:23,759
world in different countries and so I

30
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:26,700
think everybody here it's probably

31
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:28,290
familiar with traveling to a new country

32
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:30,450
looking up an event they're trying to

33
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:33,420
buy a train ticket maybe and noticing

34
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:34,619
that websites look a little bit

35
00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:36,509
different and I think especially here in

36
00:01:36,509 --> 00:01:38,520
Europe this is a no surprise where I'm

37
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:41,130
from the US it is more shocking when you

38
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:42,360
when you leave and things are so

39
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:45,240
different and I wanted to jump just into

40
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:49,320
a couple examples to warm us up

41
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:51,720
this is Rakuten which is the top

42
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:54,360
Japanese ecommerce site and this this

43
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,130
talk was actually inspired by some

44
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:58,049
friends going to Japan and coming back

45
00:01:58,049 --> 00:02:00,420
and talking about how different Japanese

46
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:02,939
web looked so what's different about it

47
00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:04,649
it's obviously it's like a familiar

48
00:02:04,649 --> 00:02:06,180
website right but it's obviously in

49
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:09,270
Japanese there's a lot of there's a

50
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:11,760
pointer there's a lot of navigation

51
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,230
option

52
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:16,410
really readily clickable there's a heavy

53
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:18,360
use of iconography paired with the

54
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:21,120
navigation items I noticed and I noticed

55
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,160
also that in the product images

56
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,810
themselves there's a lot of baked in

57
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:28,470
text so the marketing images all have

58
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:31,470
text in them and just to compare it to a

59
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:34,110
Western site Amazon and there are fewer

60
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:36,450
navigation elements in general so all of

61
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:38,580
the product categories are hidden behind

62
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:40,890
a really big hamburger menu and there's

63
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:43,230
no text in the product images themselves

64
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:45,270
the text is natively rendered in the

65
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:47,310
browser around them and it's generally

66
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:50,310
more spaced out and to move to a

67
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:52,760
European example this is the French

68
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:56,550
train travel portal it's really normal

69
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:57,989
here in Europe you probably know more

70
00:02:57,989 --> 00:03:00,480
than me that is pretty normal to get on

71
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,280
a train to go for a vacation or to

72
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,620
travel to a new city and I've noticed

73
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:07,320
that on a lot of European transit sites

74
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,030
it's very they've adopted this really

75
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:11,790
friendly rounded color like candy

76
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:15,660
colored design aesthetic with a really

77
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:17,730
heavy focus on packages and hotels and

78
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:20,910
destinations and so if we look at Amtrak

79
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:23,700
which is the largest rail system in the

80
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:27,630
US it's way more serious it's there's

81
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:30,239
actually no destinations on this page at

82
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:33,060
all and I think it's probably more

83
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:35,310
commuter focused and so the differences

84
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:37,049
are subtle but they are they're there

85
00:03:37,049 --> 00:03:39,870
right they're different and I've started

86
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:43,650
to wonder why they're different and as I

87
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:45,870
think through them I keep coming back to

88
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:49,140
my background and studying culture I

89
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:50,880
always thought that there were clear

90
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:53,730
right or wrong ways to develop websites

91
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:55,230
like if you're gonna make an e-commerce

92
00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:57,390
site it should look this way and if

93
00:03:57,390 --> 00:03:58,709
you're gonna build a social network it

94
00:03:58,709 --> 00:04:00,810
needs to be super experiencial and look

95
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:03,900
that way but I think that within a more

96
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:06,720
cultural and anthropological lens that

97
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,299
might not be the best approach and I

98
00:04:09,299 --> 00:04:11,010
think the question of why are websites

99
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:13,260
different around the world it's kind of

100
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:14,700
analogous to asking why are people

101
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:16,470
different around the world which is

102
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:19,709
really hard to answer and scientists

103
00:04:19,709 --> 00:04:21,120
have been trying to do that for hundreds

104
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,310
of years so I'm gonna try in 30 minutes

105
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:24,510
to do it

106
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:28,110
but I think it comes down to sort of my

107
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:30,420
new core belief which is that technology

108
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:33,900
is a mode of cultural expression just

109
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:37,560
like language music dancing food and

110
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:40,830
that technology that we use on phones

111
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:44,400
laptops and iPads are just another

112
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,830
social tool that humans use to express

113
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:50,250
themselves and that even our technical

114
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:52,290
decisions you know the frameworks the

115
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:54,840
programming languages the services and

116
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:58,440
the design we use in in the websites and

117
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:01,230
the technology we build are driven by a

118
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:04,080
combination of cultural factors so

119
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,010
that's really what this talk is about

120
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:09,440
it's kind of a mix of culture technology

121
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,060
but just to preempt it a little bit why

122
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:13,620
is this important to talk about why

123
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:16,050
can't people and hungry figure it out

124
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:18,540
for themselves and build websites for

125
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:20,910
Hungarian audiences and people in the US

126
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:24,510
will do it for us audiences there's a

127
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:27,180
couple big reasons one is that we are

128
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:30,000
really all in it together computer and

129
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,770
Internet technology I think has

130
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:34,860
globalized truly and utterly faster than

131
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:38,460
any other human technology we all rely

132
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:40,680
on the same fundamental foundation for

133
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,780
building software like operating systems

134
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:44,940
we use the same mobile phones mobile

135
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:46,920
operating systems we're all here to talk

136
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:49,320
about JavaScript probably most of us are

137
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,720
familiar with using some really core

138
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,660
frameworks like react we rely on the

139
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:56,460
same developer tools an infrastructure

140
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:59,010
like AWS and we're seeing these huge

141
00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:01,170
mega global corporations forming like

142
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:06,450
Amazon Google and Facebook and the more

143
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:08,550
and more of the world is coming online

144
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:11,010
so there's this concept known as the

145
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:14,460
digital divide so in 1990 most people on

146
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:16,230
the internet we're like in the u.s.

147
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:19,470
maybe in the UK and today there are

148
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:21,480
three and a half billion people on the

149
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:21,990
Internet

150
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:23,210
which is half of the world's population

151
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:25,890
which is kind of shocking for how both

152
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:29,250
large and small it is but it's

153
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:32,370
definitely shrinking some researchers

154
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:35,700
estimate that the entire world will be

155
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:37,950
online between 2030 and

156
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:41,060
forty and emerging economies like India

157
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:44,370
Bangladesh Ghana are adopting the

158
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:47,250
internet really exponential rates and so

159
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:49,260
this is bringing new users onto the

160
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:51,090
internet in those countries which is

161
00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:53,490
creating demand for Internet services

162
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:56,100
and companies which will create demand

163
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:57,900
for developers in those countries and

164
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:59,940
they'll be using and coming to a lot of

165
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:02,250
the software and technology and tooling

166
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:05,910
that is already existing and as

167
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:07,980
developers we benefit from being

168
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:09,690
globally connected we can share code

169
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:11,790
with each other I can look up answers to

170
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:13,860
questions that were you know answered by

171
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:16,440
somebody across the world we can more

172
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,880
easily learn from each other we visit

173
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,560
each other's countries for conferences

174
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:22,770
like I'm doing right now and innovations

175
00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:24,780
that we make in one place like a coal

176
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:26,940
trick I pick up here I can take home and

177
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:29,190
use in my home country and that's a

178
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:30,840
really cool thing that not every

179
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:33,900
industry benefits from and finally a lot

180
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:36,480
of us work for internet companies and

181
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:39,440
our users are online and as

182
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:43,320
internet-based companies we are uniquely

183
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,750
able to reach new audiences in global

184
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:48,330
markets again this is especially true in

185
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:50,390
Europe where it's pretty common to

186
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:52,620
attract new users from neighboring

187
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:55,160
countries and so translation

188
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:58,050
localization is becoming a really core

189
00:07:58,050 --> 00:08:00,210
part of growth strategies for internet

190
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:02,250
internet companies and so learning to

191
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:04,680
localize apps well is pretty critical in

192
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,840
building successful software that's able

193
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:13,020
to grow so with all that in mind how can

194
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:16,260
we think about culture as technologists

195
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:18,840
as engineers as we approach building for

196
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,520
the web in building technology in

197
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:23,490
general we can start by understanding

198
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:25,500
some of the different cultural factors

199
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,750
that would contribute to differences in

200
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:30,690
building software and the first one is

201
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:32,729
language it's really the core activity

202
00:08:32,729 --> 00:08:35,280
of what we do every day it's we

203
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:37,140
literally do it all day and it extends

204
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:40,080
to programming whether you as a

205
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,940
developer can read the technical

206
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:44,310
documentation for a project you want to

207
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:47,220
try and how you would design a web site

208
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:51,900
to be read in a language by your users

209
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:54,510
the second our cultural attitudes which

210
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:56,430
are the really invisible but really

211
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:59,340
strongly held true differences between

212
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:01,950
people which is how they have integrated

213
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:04,440
technology into their daily lives what

214
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,180
their lifestyles are like what their

215
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:09,740
behaviors and their beliefs are like

216
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:12,900
there's government policy so some

217
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:15,210
countries don't regulate the Internet

218
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:18,690
some of them pass restrictive or you

219
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:21,450
know the sensible regulations others

220
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:23,790
censor the Internet and then finally

221
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:25,590
people across the world access the

222
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:27,390
Internet in different ways they use

223
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:28,860
different types of devices they have

224
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:32,360
different levels of speed and stability

225
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,290
so I'd like to go through each of these

226
00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:36,360
and talk about how developers in

227
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,010
different parts of the world are dealing

228
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:40,590
with these sort of different types of

229
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:42,660
contexts and the challenges that they're

230
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:46,050
facing and so let's start with language

231
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:47,970
there are a lot of languages in the

232
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:50,340
world and there are over seven thousand

233
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:51,690
known languages this is one of my

234
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:54,570
favorite maps from school and most of

235
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:55,950
these languages have their own writing

236
00:09:55,950 --> 00:09:58,230
systems and one of those writing systems

237
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:00,870
is Hangul which is the primary Korean

238
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:03,150
writing system and when you take all of

239
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:05,490
the unique characters in Hangul and put

240
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:07,560
it into a Unicode block you get a block

241
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,150
that's about eleven thousand characters

242
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:19,290
large so this has challenges right it's

243
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:21,240
not the Latin alphabet there are no

244
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:24,300
longer 26 and some but you might have to

245
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:27,240
render on the screen and so that

246
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,370
proposes challenges for natively

247
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:31,950
rendering Chinese Japanese and Korean on

248
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:34,620
the web first of all it's expensive to

249
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:36,270
design these fonts because each of these

250
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:40,140
characters has certain spacing and there

251
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:42,660
are thousands of them again and the

252
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:44,580
files that contain these fonts can reach

253
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:46,680
15 megabytes and so this becomes really

254
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,690
prohibitive especially on a mobile

255
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:51,240
device or in a place with with slower

256
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:54,840
internet speeds so developers have to

257
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,730
get really clever and one common work

258
00:10:56,730 --> 00:10:58,890
around this is a Korean ecommerce site

259
00:10:58,890 --> 00:11:02,550
called G market in this case every

260
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:03,940
single piece of text on this

261
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:08,080
is an image which is kind of unholy to

262
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:11,020
us maybe but there's huge benefits it

263
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:13,570
loads faster than a 15 megabyte plant

264
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:16,030
file and you can the developer can

265
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:17,970
ensure the quality of the text rendering

266
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:19,840
and they know what's going to look the

267
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:23,200
same across browsers and in mobile

268
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,470
phones and there are some there are some

269
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:29,140
newer ways to render these fonts more

270
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:31,900
quickly through subsetting and so sub

271
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:33,370
setting is where you take a really large

272
00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:35,740
font file with a lot of characters or

273
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:37,540
glyphs in it and slice it into pieces

274
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:39,610
and just load the pieces you need and

275
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:41,440
some browsers like Chrome now will do

276
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,210
this automatically and there are also

277
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:45,820
really cool projects I'm so google fonts

278
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:48,670
has this new Korean font library in it

279
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:51,550
that uses machine learning to subset

280
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:54,670
fonts based on how often they're the

281
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:56,860
characters are seen together and when

282
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:58,720
these fonts are served through the

283
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,310
google fonts API it benefits from

284
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:02,260
cross-site caching which means the user

285
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:04,360
would only need to load the font file

286
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:07,660
once in order to benefit from it across

287
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:09,640
many web sites during their session and

288
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:11,080
so techniques like this are making it

289
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,960
more possible and easier to render

290
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:16,060
languages like Korean Japanese and

291
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:19,330
Chinese natively on the web and other

292
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:21,220
languages are written in other

293
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:23,380
directions and in other ways and so

294
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:25,960
Hebrew and Arabic are written from right

295
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:28,300
to left and they require layouts that

296
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:31,150
are bi-directional so this is the

297
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:34,690
tel-aviv Museum of Art in English but in

298
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:37,150
Hebrew it's completely flipped really

299
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:40,990
down to the navigation itself and as a

300
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:43,810
native reader of Hebrew it wouldn't make

301
00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:45,640
sense if you had just translated this

302
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:48,400
and it was from left to right it really

303
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:52,140
has to be a mirrored layout in order to

304
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:54,850
feel native and make sense to a native

305
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:57,700
reader there were some CSS frameworks to

306
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:59,770
make this easier this is right-to-left

307
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:03,670
CSS which will flip directional CSS

308
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:06,040
properties like border left or margin

309
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:10,060
right and when you translate text to

310
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:11,740
begin with it takes different amounts of

311
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:14,320
space different characters have

312
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,900
different heights and widths words may

313
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:17,769
be longer there might

314
00:13:17,769 --> 00:13:20,920
more or less spaces and other rules like

315
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:24,369
that so the word views in Italian is

316
00:13:24,369 --> 00:13:26,139
actually three times longer than it is

317
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:28,059
in English and this is a subtle

318
00:13:28,059 --> 00:13:29,589
difference but this is like a YouTube

319
00:13:29,589 --> 00:13:31,660
card or they had it pushes it to the

320
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:33,910
next line and so if you sort of compound

321
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:36,549
this across an entire layout you can see

322
00:13:36,549 --> 00:13:38,259
how you would really need to allow for

323
00:13:38,259 --> 00:13:40,360
the expansion and contraction of text as

324
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:43,660
you translate it between languages and

325
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:45,999
in my really informal test tie is about

326
00:13:45,999 --> 00:13:49,929
1.7 times the space I'm just to adjust

327
00:13:49,929 --> 00:13:54,489
in this sentence so really localization

328
00:13:54,489 --> 00:13:56,949
is more than just translating strings

329
00:13:56,949 --> 00:13:58,720
you can't just swap the strings if

330
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,879
you're going to create an Arabic version

331
00:14:00,879 --> 00:14:02,350
of your website you need to build a

332
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:04,660
bi-directional layout and if you are

333
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:06,549
translating into new languages you

334
00:14:06,549 --> 00:14:07,989
should account for the expansion and

335
00:14:07,989 --> 00:14:09,819
contraction of text I definitely

336
00:14:09,819 --> 00:14:12,309
experienced this in the past where you

337
00:14:12,309 --> 00:14:14,259
swap the strings out and things start to

338
00:14:14,259 --> 00:14:15,129
go really weird

339
00:14:15,129 --> 00:14:17,739
I mean users want to you know use a nice

340
00:14:17,739 --> 00:14:19,799
experience and they can tell if it was

341
00:14:19,799 --> 00:14:24,730
quickly done so we're building websites

342
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:26,559
in many different languages right and

343
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:29,980
there's over 7,000 of them but I think

344
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:31,540
one of the really interesting things is

345
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:33,579
that we're all programming in English

346
00:14:33,579 --> 00:14:36,869
and so these are the reserved words in

347
00:14:36,869 --> 00:14:39,339
JavaScript and they're all in English

348
00:14:39,339 --> 00:14:40,809
and this is true for every major

349
00:14:40,809 --> 00:14:43,779
language that we use even languages like

350
00:14:43,779 --> 00:14:45,790
Ruby which was invented actually in

351
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:49,209
Japan and it's kind of weird when we

352
00:14:49,209 --> 00:14:51,249
look at the spoken languages in the

353
00:14:51,249 --> 00:14:54,220
world it's a really big disconnect so

354
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:55,899
you know English is no more commonly

355
00:14:55,899 --> 00:14:58,299
spoken than Hindi and certainly less

356
00:14:58,299 --> 00:15:01,449
commonly spoken of in Chinese and what's

357
00:15:01,449 --> 00:15:02,709
happened here is that English has become

358
00:15:02,709 --> 00:15:05,919
a legal franca which means a common or

359
00:15:05,919 --> 00:15:08,410
trade language between groups of people

360
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:10,839
for computing and it's actually become a

361
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:12,879
lot more than that English has become a

362
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:15,459
common language for diplomacy and for

363
00:15:15,459 --> 00:15:17,980
business and trade and it's not a

364
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:21,850
totally equitable history either but

365
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:23,529
adopting these common languages does

366
00:15:23,529 --> 00:15:25,329
have a lot of benefits it means that we

367
00:15:25,329 --> 00:15:27,759
can all be sitting in this room coming

368
00:15:27,759 --> 00:15:29,740
from different countries with our own

369
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:31,270
you know first natively

370
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:33,160
which is and understand each other and

371
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:35,040
I'm giving this talk in English which is

372
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,970
crazy because we're in the middle of

373
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:40,540
Europe and I don't have to translate you

374
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:42,220
know a piece of your code into my

375
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:44,500
language in order to run it first of all

376
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:47,020
orders understand what it's doing I mean

377
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:49,270
because we're programming sort of it all

378
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:51,730
in the same terminology and language it

379
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:54,760
makes it easier for us to grow software

380
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,020
together and build on top of each

381
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:57,580
other's work rather than developing

382
00:15:57,580 --> 00:16:00,670
technology sort of in parallel separate

383
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:03,880
language groups but I also think it's

384
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:06,490
important to recognize that a code isn't

385
00:16:06,490 --> 00:16:09,790
really English I don't know what RF

386
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:13,690
means and I I don't think you actually

387
00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:16,210
need to be conversational English to

388
00:16:16,210 --> 00:16:17,830
learn how to code

389
00:16:17,830 --> 00:16:19,780
I would probably describe code as like a

390
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:22,390
new dialect some weird morphed subset of

391
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:25,870
English I'm in some programming tools

392
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:28,360
this is scratch which was developed by

393
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:31,540
MIT a school in the US it's used in

394
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:34,030
libraries and classrooms around the

395
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:34,420
world

396
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:37,000
I'm skips this English based paradigm

397
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,280
altogether and they have this this block

398
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,780
abstraction which makes it really easy

399
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:42,900
to translate between different languages

400
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:45,220
and research has shown that kids learn

401
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:47,140
how to code faster in their native

402
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:49,960
language which makes a lot of sense

403
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:52,600
and just because reserved words in the

404
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,700
programming languages we all use are in

405
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:56,710
English doesn't mean they have to be and

406
00:16:56,710 --> 00:17:00,370
this is a this is your lang which is a

407
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:03,580
node like language in Yoruba which is a

408
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:06,339
language spoken in Nigeria and I think

409
00:17:06,339 --> 00:17:07,750
projects like this while they haven't

410
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:10,000
you know hit a critical mass yet could

411
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,280
be really useful for getting programmers

412
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:14,200
who don't speak English in the door and

413
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,450
pass that first really big learning

414
00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:20,520
curve and then also I think that

415
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,390
developers in general especially

416
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:24,370
developers who don't speak English

417
00:17:24,370 --> 00:17:26,589
really want to read documentation and

418
00:17:26,589 --> 00:17:30,550
debug issues in their native language it

419
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:32,260
is again really important for developers

420
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:34,450
who don't speak English translations and

421
00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:36,730
channel and channels for talking in your

422
00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:38,620
native language about programming and

423
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:41,290
code really benefit everybody it helps

424
00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:43,510
make these non-english speaking

425
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:45,060
developers lives easier

426
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:48,180
and for an open-source project or a

427
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:49,740
developer tool it can draw more

428
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:52,080
developers into the project and I think

429
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,510
given the growth of you know the youth

430
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:56,820
the internet base and the years to come

431
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:59,250
it will become even more important and

432
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:01,410
people find translations so important

433
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:03,360
that they will do it themselves if you

434
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,100
know an open-source project doesn't have

435
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:07,590
any and so this is Doc's China which

436
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:09,750
aggregates Chinese language translations

437
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:13,200
of many of the open-source projects we

438
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,920
all use I think it's a pretty incredible

439
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:18,590
project and a really great example of

440
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:21,780
you know just getting it done but these

441
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:24,120
in unofficial translations do have some

442
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:26,220
issues so they're less discoverable

443
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:28,020
because they're not a part of the core

444
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:30,030
documentation and they have more

445
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:31,980
opportunity to grow stale or be

446
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:33,600
incorrect because they're not part

447
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,000
they're not maintained by the official

448
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,290
maintainer x' the react org recently led

449
00:18:40,290 --> 00:18:42,540
a project to add a bunch of translations

450
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:44,760
to their core documentation so on their

451
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,590
site there are now a bunch of different

452
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:48,330
language versions I think is a really

453
00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:50,640
great example and a fantastic step to

454
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,860
recognizing their super international

455
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:55,920
community they even built a bot to open

456
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,720
pull requests in each of the

457
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:58,440
translations

458
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:01,050
whenever the core English Doc's change I

459
00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:03,450
know that this was inspired by the

460
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:06,120
vue.js team who are also doing a really

461
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,290
good job and I think it's a great

462
00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:09,510
strategy for including developers around

463
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:10,170
the world

464
00:19:10,170 --> 00:19:13,380
I don't know that take another sip of

465
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:16,230
water I invite you all to do this as

466
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:23,400
well so moving past language let's talk

467
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:27,690
about culture cultural differences play

468
00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:30,420
a really big role in how technology is

469
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:34,200
used in people's everyday lives cultural

470
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:34,890
attitudes

471
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:37,350
refer to people's beliefs their

472
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:38,790
lifestyles their customs

473
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:40,200
you know how they greet each other in

474
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:42,600
the morning or how they were coffee and

475
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,580
what time they eat meals that and what

476
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:46,440
kind of devices they use to do all of

477
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:48,230
those things and talk to each other and

478
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:51,320
culture is really hard to quantify

479
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:53,700
there's a framework for doing it

480
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:55,620
it's called Hofstede's cultural

481
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:56,660
dimensions

482
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:58,580
and it's not perfect I really hate the

483
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:01,100
the gendered power versus nurture

484
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:03,800
spectrum but I think it is a good

485
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,660
framework for understanding how

486
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:07,310
different nations and cultural groups

487
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:09,920
might be different from each other like

488
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,630
some might be more focused on preserving

489
00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:14,330
tradition or more oriented towards

490
00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:17,660
future and change some cultures are

491
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:20,000
really focused on collective success so

492
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,310
the success of their family group or of

493
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:24,770
their country others are like no screw

494
00:20:24,770 --> 00:20:27,160
them I will just get rich myself right

495
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:31,400
and it makes more objective I won't say

496
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,800
perfectly objective comparisons between

497
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:37,370
different cultural groups possible so in

498
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:39,770
this study they surveyed a bunch of

499
00:20:39,770 --> 00:20:42,380
people around the world and we can see

500
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:46,210
that Egypt Egyptian Japanese and Russian

501
00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:48,170
participants all have much higher

502
00:20:48,170 --> 00:20:51,290
avoidance of uncertain situations so

503
00:20:51,290 --> 00:20:52,820
these are situations where there might

504
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:54,890
be like lack of information

505
00:20:54,890 --> 00:20:56,900
there's just generally an uncertain

506
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:59,570
outcome we can see that the u.s. in

507
00:20:59,570 --> 00:21:02,690
comparison is extremely indulgent and

508
00:21:02,690 --> 00:21:05,540
really values values individualism and

509
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:07,490
individual success over these countries

510
00:21:07,490 --> 00:21:09,920
as well and I think that although these

511
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,720
these differences are subconscious and

512
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:14,780
they show up in the way you would build

513
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:17,390
a website or launch a product in these

514
00:21:17,390 --> 00:21:19,910
countries so this is a website for

515
00:21:19,910 --> 00:21:22,160
purchasing tickets for the Ghibli Museum

516
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:25,790
near Tokyo it is a notoriously booked

517
00:21:25,790 --> 00:21:28,790
and really difficult to get into museum

518
00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:30,950
but on these sites it's really common to

519
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:33,580
see really elaborate instructions

520
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:36,020
step-by-step with screenshots of the

521
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:37,310
kind of software you would need to use

522
00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:39,200
and down to the buttons you'd press to

523
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,900
get a ticket so you know exactly how to

524
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:43,670
get the ticket and if you don't get one

525
00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:46,760
you know why and to contrast this with

526
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:50,060
the brode Museum in Los Angeles first of

527
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:51,530
all there's you can either show up or

528
00:21:51,530 --> 00:21:52,790
buy a ticket so there's a couple ways

529
00:21:52,790 --> 00:21:55,070
and once you start to dig into the site

530
00:21:55,070 --> 00:21:56,990
you see all this uncertain language like

531
00:21:56,990 --> 00:21:58,880
oh there's a best chance to view the

532
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:01,070
exhibit and it's first-come first-serve

533
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:03,230
so you don't actually know if you get to

534
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:06,050
see the whole museum if you go which

535
00:22:06,050 --> 00:22:09,440
results in funny reddit threads

536
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,490
like wouldn't it be easier to travel

537
00:22:11,490 --> 00:22:13,800
through Narnia on a flying pig than to

538
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:17,790
get a ticket to go to this museum and I

539
00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:19,170
think that we can think about cultural

540
00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:20,880
differences not just in these really

541
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:23,520
broad terms in terms of like societies

542
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,620
and nations but also in terms of teams

543
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:28,050
teams that we work in or cities in our

544
00:22:28,050 --> 00:22:30,000
own countries and so at my company

545
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,610
ribbon I help I build tools that help

546
00:22:32,610 --> 00:22:35,670
people manage the purchasing of homes so

547
00:22:35,670 --> 00:22:38,340
we built this really elaborate sales

548
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:40,470
tracking tool and we thought we designed

549
00:22:40,470 --> 00:22:42,660
the table really nicely but the team

550
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:45,390
kept going back to Google sheets and we

551
00:22:45,390 --> 00:22:46,950
couldn't keep up with all their requests

552
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:49,800
and changes and so we eventually gave up

553
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,300
because they just wouldn't use the tool

554
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:53,100
and they kept doing all this data entry

555
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:55,640
and we replaced it with this monstrosity

556
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:58,500
which is a third party and Beda Bowl

557
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:01,650
spreadsheet tool and they loved it it

558
00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:03,270
turns out it's exactly what they needed

559
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:05,970
they needed something compact so we

560
00:23:05,970 --> 00:23:07,830
didn't need to optimize for readability

561
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:10,890
or beauty they didn't want to scroll

562
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:12,750
they needed to see all the information

563
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:14,880
all together in one screen and they

564
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,650
wanted it to be really flexible because

565
00:23:16,650 --> 00:23:18,750
their requirements and KPIs were

566
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:21,810
changing all the time and so by building

567
00:23:21,810 --> 00:23:24,450
this presumably worst product actually

568
00:23:24,450 --> 00:23:26,250
by not building a product at all and

569
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:28,320
deleting a bunch of code we better met

570
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:32,610
the needs of our team and so just to go

571
00:23:32,610 --> 00:23:34,860
back to the cultural dimensions let's

572
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:37,620
compare the US and China China is also

573
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:40,380
pretty low on uncertainty avoidance but

574
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:43,110
much much higher on future orientation

575
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:44,700
and so this means that they're willing

576
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:47,970
to deal with ambiguity sort of as a

577
00:23:47,970 --> 00:23:50,880
generalization and more adaptable to

578
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:54,210
changing technologies and so what we're

579
00:23:54,210 --> 00:23:56,130
seeing is that China has adopted mobile

580
00:23:56,130 --> 00:23:59,250
technology in all aspects of their lives

581
00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:01,800
so QR codes are found literally

582
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:05,730
everywhere in transit advertisements you

583
00:24:05,730 --> 00:24:07,800
use it to open websites to add contacts

584
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:10,770
to get information to buy tickets now to

585
00:24:10,770 --> 00:24:13,500
make payments WeChat is an absolutely

586
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:15,480
ubiquitous app with over a billion users

587
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:20,550
in China and in that area that you know

588
00:24:20,550 --> 00:24:22,500
has really spread throughout China

589
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:25,320
years and years before we saw the the QR

590
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:28,140
technology catch on in the West and so

591
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:29,880
we're really starting to see China that

592
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:32,430
outpace the US and the West in

593
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:35,820
technological innovation and this kind

594
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:37,020
of thing changes how you would launch

595
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:38,760
startups right so in a really mobile

596
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,920
oriented country you might skip a

597
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:43,410
desktop app altogether so this is a

598
00:24:43,410 --> 00:24:46,110
light app that you would build to be

599
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:49,530
opened from a QR code in the we chat in

600
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:53,160
the WeChat mobile browser and there

601
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,720
again not meant to be viewed from

602
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,160
desktop it just doesn't work on a

603
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:58,920
desktop it's a completely different kind

604
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:02,190
of environment there and while we're on

605
00:25:02,190 --> 00:25:04,680
the topic of China we can talk about the

606
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:06,540
fact that the internet is not actually

607
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:09,180
equally free and available in every

608
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:12,030
country in the same way so Internet

609
00:25:12,030 --> 00:25:13,950
infrastructure is provided through

610
00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:16,650
private companies and utilities subject

611
00:25:16,650 --> 00:25:19,290
to national laws so in the past

612
00:25:19,290 --> 00:25:21,960
China has cracked down on foreign

613
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,970
services they have blocked Google api's

614
00:25:23,970 --> 00:25:26,340
which will force developers to find

615
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:29,340
mirrors and alternatives the latest

616
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:31,050
status is that Google APs are being

617
00:25:31,050 --> 00:25:33,750
served through servers in Beijing here

618
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:35,760
in Europe there are new privacy

619
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,470
regulations called gdpr

620
00:25:37,470 --> 00:25:39,300
so I'm sure everybody here is familiar

621
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:42,120
with the requirement to get users

622
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:46,440
permission to set and use cookies and

623
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:49,650
unfortunately in July the u.s. sanction

624
00:25:49,650 --> 00:25:52,890
Iran and a developer in Iran named

625
00:25:52,890 --> 00:25:54,420
Shaheen wrote a really good blog post

626
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:56,760
about what it's like to be a developer

627
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:59,460
living in a country with sanctions

628
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:01,680
imposed on it talked about how really

629
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:03,870
critical developer services were cut off

630
00:26:03,870 --> 00:26:06,660
like gitlab docker Android developer

631
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:09,210
just the documentation site itself and

632
00:26:09,210 --> 00:26:11,700
even github and so developers lose

633
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:13,740
access to their code their sites might

634
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:16,710
go down they have to use proxies and

635
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:19,260
VPNs which is questionably legal and

636
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:21,900
pretty dangerous to have them do and

637
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:22,920
it's you know it's a very challenging

638
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:25,620
situation and continue it's going to

639
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:29,000
continue to be a problem

640
00:26:29,010 --> 00:26:30,690
and finally internet access in general

641
00:26:30,690 --> 00:26:32,610
is very different across the world

642
00:26:32,610 --> 00:26:34,770
people don't use the Internet in the

643
00:26:34,770 --> 00:26:35,080
same

644
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:38,529
way so for example mobile traffic is

645
00:26:38,529 --> 00:26:41,409
much greater in Africa and Asia than it

646
00:26:41,409 --> 00:26:44,049
is in the Western Hemisphere so in 2018

647
00:26:44,049 --> 00:26:49,419
I think 78% of visits to websites in

648
00:26:49,419 --> 00:26:53,260
India were on mobile devices whereas in

649
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:56,140
the US the split is more 50/50 so in a

650
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:58,029
place like India where three-quarters of

651
00:26:58,029 --> 00:27:00,309
Internet traffic is from mobile you

652
00:27:00,309 --> 00:27:01,840
would certainly build a mobile first

653
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:04,120
website or a native app before you built

654
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:08,200
a desktop site and if you look at

655
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:10,299
high-speed sort of broadband access

656
00:27:10,299 --> 00:27:13,750
which is fast stable internet it's not

657
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:16,299
equally distributed either there was a

658
00:27:16,299 --> 00:27:17,830
really good talk about this yesterday I

659
00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:22,720
think well I know and there's a you know

660
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:23,950
there's a really big gulf between the

661
00:27:23,950 --> 00:27:25,690
developed world and the developing world

662
00:27:25,690 --> 00:27:28,330
and people in rural areas and every

663
00:27:28,330 --> 00:27:31,419
country also experienced this where with

664
00:27:31,419 --> 00:27:34,360
a slow internet connection first of all

665
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:36,789
you have slower speeds but your

666
00:27:36,789 --> 00:27:38,740
connection might also drop out too so it

667
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:40,600
will be intermittent and this can make

668
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,190
using apps and websites really

669
00:27:42,190 --> 00:27:43,419
frustrating

670
00:27:43,419 --> 00:27:46,059
and so as a developer you can improve

671
00:27:46,059 --> 00:27:49,149
this experience by offering on offline

672
00:27:49,149 --> 00:27:51,610
support so by using techniques like

673
00:27:51,610 --> 00:27:53,620
local storage service workers by

674
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:55,840
building progressive web apps and this

675
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:59,169
is a progressive web app from Kenya it's

676
00:27:59,169 --> 00:28:03,760
an another ecommerce site and you use it

677
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,559
by visiting the site in Safari and

678
00:28:05,559 --> 00:28:06,940
actually adding it to your home screen

679
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:10,149
and so by doing that and it has the then

680
00:28:10,149 --> 00:28:12,190
has the ability to cache content locally

681
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:15,070
and use service workers to stay usable

682
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:16,809
even if the internet connection drops

683
00:28:16,809 --> 00:28:19,690
out and these progressive web apps also

684
00:28:19,690 --> 00:28:21,429
take up less space on a phone which

685
00:28:21,429 --> 00:28:22,809
would be really important in a place

686
00:28:22,809 --> 00:28:24,940
where a lot of people use budget phones

687
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:26,230
and they're not using really expensive

688
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:28,990
iPhones and this this article in

689
00:28:28,990 --> 00:28:34,029
business and usage and conversion after

690
00:28:34,029 --> 00:28:37,090
building this progressive web app and so

691
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:39,370
it's not just that by architecting the

692
00:28:39,370 --> 00:28:41,620
application differently it became better

693
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:44,230
and easier for users to use actually

694
00:28:44,230 --> 00:28:45,820
resulted in a better business outcome

695
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:46,590
and more money

696
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:50,850
big maid so that's a really Roman tour

697
00:28:50,850 --> 00:28:53,850
of just some parts of the world and just

698
00:28:53,850 --> 00:28:55,620
some challenges that developers in other

699
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:56,309
countries

700
00:28:56,309 --> 00:28:58,980
experience I think that it is really fun

701
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:02,519
and fascinating to talk about and I like

702
00:29:02,519 --> 00:29:05,279
it sort of in an academic sense but I

703
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:06,870
also think there are ways we can all

704
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:09,720
apply this to our everyday and the first

705
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:12,149
is that we can always be thinking about

706
00:29:12,149 --> 00:29:14,129
and including developers who might not

707
00:29:14,129 --> 00:29:16,259
have the same access as us you know I

708
00:29:16,259 --> 00:29:17,669
think probably everybody in this room

709
00:29:17,669 --> 00:29:19,919
speaks English not every developer does

710
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:22,619
or will if you are part of an

711
00:29:22,619 --> 00:29:24,360
open-source project or build developer

712
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:26,429
tools consider making translations of

713
00:29:26,429 --> 00:29:29,159
priority and if you have friends who are

714
00:29:29,159 --> 00:29:31,649
affected by sanctions and censorship we

715
00:29:31,649 --> 00:29:35,279
should be giving them a platform if you

716
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:37,710
come across a website or an application

717
00:29:37,710 --> 00:29:39,869
that isn't what you're used to so if you

718
00:29:39,869 --> 00:29:41,850
travel to a new country and things feel

719
00:29:41,850 --> 00:29:44,309
differently try to think about the

720
00:29:44,309 --> 00:29:45,809
cultural context in which it was made

721
00:29:45,809 --> 00:29:48,869
what led to it being built that way and

722
00:29:48,869 --> 00:29:51,480
try not to apply your own value system

723
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:54,509
to another person or another project

724
00:29:54,509 --> 00:29:56,730
that was built with a completely

725
00:29:56,730 --> 00:29:58,409
different value system in mind and this

726
00:29:58,409 --> 00:30:00,299
is called cultural relativity it's a

727
00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:02,879
really core anthropological concept and

728
00:30:02,879 --> 00:30:05,610
it helps us avoid using loaded terms to

729
00:30:05,610 --> 00:30:07,980
describe user interfaces like cluttered

730
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:11,789
or ugly or text access old when it might

731
00:30:11,789 --> 00:30:14,249
be more of a lack of context and I think

732
00:30:14,249 --> 00:30:15,840
this can generally make us more

733
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:17,700
inclusive and empathetic with each other

734
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:20,519
as well and finally user empathy is not

735
00:30:20,519 --> 00:30:22,740
just for product managers and designers

736
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:25,470
we as engineers can use it to make

737
00:30:25,470 --> 00:30:28,740
better technical decisions for the tools

738
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:31,409
and the products we build and we can

739
00:30:31,409 --> 00:30:35,009
also use it to localize to our own users

740
00:30:35,009 --> 00:30:36,869
people in our own you know in our own

741
00:30:36,869 --> 00:30:41,700
cities so if you know that your your

742
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:43,830
product has users in an international

743
00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:46,019
market or that your company is growing

744
00:30:46,019 --> 00:30:47,639
to attract people from another country

745
00:30:47,639 --> 00:30:49,549
where they speak a different language

746
00:30:49,549 --> 00:30:52,409
consider putting in more effort to on

747
00:30:52,409 --> 00:30:54,330
providing a truly localized

748
00:30:54,330 --> 00:30:56,460
strong translation or Architect your

749
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:58,200
application to be a progressive web app

750
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,969
if your users experience

751
00:30:59,969 --> 00:31:02,519
slower or intermittent connections I

752
00:31:02,519 --> 00:31:04,949
mean I think that the companies and the

753
00:31:04,949 --> 00:31:08,190
engineers that do this will win the

754
00:31:08,190 --> 00:31:09,989
hearts of their users they will build

755
00:31:09,989 --> 00:31:13,169
better software and ultimately benefit

756
00:31:13,169 --> 00:31:14,879
from the growth of the Internet in the

757
00:31:14,879 --> 00:31:17,519
decades to come and that's all I have

758
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:18,700
today thank you
