1
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:09,719

yeah okay so my talk is titled the

2
00:00:09,719 --> 00:00:12,570
browser as a modular networked video

3
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:15,570
synthesizer and everything I'm going to

4
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:19,140
talk about is online in the form of sort

5
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:21,900
of a code editor and graphic surrender

6
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:27,269
at this at this website Hydra editor dot

7
00:00:27,269 --> 00:00:31,289
glitch dot me and this is sort of a tool

8
00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:32,730
I've been building but really it's more

9
00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:35,070
of an investigation of of three

10
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:36,690
different things that might seem kind of

11
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:39,089
separate collaboration in the creation

12
00:00:39,089 --> 00:00:41,549
of live visuals possibilities of

13
00:00:41,549 --> 00:00:43,680
peer-to-peer technology on the web and

14
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,739
feedback loops and has also become a

15
00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:49,350
platform for live coding visuals in

16
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:54,589
JavaScript so I'm going to start with a

17
00:00:54,589 --> 00:00:57,479
reference from the 1970s this is the

18
00:00:57,479 --> 00:01:00,059
satellite arts projects by kick Galilei

19
00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:02,580
and che robe into it and what they did

20
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:06,960
was using using satellites in 1977 they

21
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,970
streamed video from two different places

22
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:11,729
and composited them on top of each other

23
00:01:11,729 --> 00:01:14,729
and what they said was that this marks

24
00:01:14,729 --> 00:01:16,890
the first time that the geographically

25
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:19,320
dispersed electronic image was

26
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:22,140
contextualized as a live immersive place

27
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:24,179
where artists and others could convene

28
00:01:24,179 --> 00:01:26,579
and co-create together on a scale that

29
00:01:26,579 --> 00:01:28,229
could be as cultural inclusive as

30
00:01:28,229 --> 00:01:30,840
desired and so this is before the

31
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,880
internet existed this is just satellites

32
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,630
and they applied to get access to this

33
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:38,909
the satellite and to send video from one

34
00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:41,640
place to another and it's sort of this

35
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:44,340
utopian idea that as soon as maybe if we

36
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:47,310
just put two images on top of each other

37
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:50,009
we create this third place it's not here

38
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:51,659
it's not there but it's this other place

39
00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:54,659
that's some hybrid of these these two

40
00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:58,319
places and I want to stay here for a

41
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:04,530
second because I think we still use this

42
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:06,990
idea of a place in talking a lot of

43
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:09,690
about the web it's a website as if

44
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:11,310
you're going somewhere or it's an

45
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:15,000
address a webpage just this idea that

46
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,330
when you access a website you're you're

47
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:21,960
going to a place and it's sort of this

48
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:25,650
analogy that doesn't necessarily have

49
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:27,120
that much to do with the underlying

50
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,100
technologies like if I go to a web site

51
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:31,380
my browser sending a message to a server

52
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:34,410
somewhere that server sending messages

53
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:36,810
back to me I'm sending messages back but

54
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:38,370
it's not there's not that there's

55
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:40,310
actually a place that I am necessarily

56
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:42,840
and then also this idea that it's live

57
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:47,400
and immersive I think Andres is talk it

58
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,290
was a good example of maybe we're just

59
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:51,450
getting right now to this idea of a live

60
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:57,090
immersive place on the web so I want to

61
00:02:57,090 --> 00:03:01,230
jump a little to now which is um and

62
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:03,960
talk about WebRTC which is a browser

63
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:06,390
protocol for streaming video audio and

64
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:09,630
data directly between clients so this

65
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:12,930
means that now in the browser we can be

66
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:15,000
a little less dependent on a centralized

67
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,090
server this server here is this pink

68
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:20,940
thing or some some way that all of these

69
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:23,550
clients can talk to each other but then

70
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:27,690
WebRTC says that I can as a client with

71
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:30,830
a browser directly send video audio and

72
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:35,990
data to another person who's connected

73
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:40,560
and in this diagram I'm I'm sure a lot

74
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,540
of people have seen it before but but

75
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:44,520
says maybe with this kind of these kinds

76
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:47,330
of decentralized protocols we can go

77
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:50,310
away from the left-hand image which is

78
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:52,650
more essentialized Network and go

79
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:55,860
towards the right-hand image which is

80
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:59,210
more of a decentralized network where

81
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:01,920
where let's of different people can

82
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,660
connect and exchange information in

83
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,010
different ways and there's a lot of

84
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:07,470
exciting projects I think being built on

85
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:10,860
these this type of protocol caught for

86
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:13,800
example web tour in speaker browser the

87
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:17,729
dot protocol and stuff like that and I

88
00:04:17,729 --> 00:04:19,500
just kind of got interested in this

89
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,150
protocol and started doing experiment

90
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:23,759
sending video balancing video around the

91
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:28,379
internet and as I was doing that I sort

92
00:04:28,379 --> 00:04:30,919
of started to feel like this

93
00:04:30,919 --> 00:04:35,169
this thing on the Ray of this network

94
00:04:35,169 --> 00:04:37,340
looked a little something like this

95
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:40,129
thing which is another reference from

96
00:04:40,129 --> 00:04:42,529
the 70s because for some reason a lot of

97
00:04:42,529 --> 00:04:45,199
my references are from the 70s maybe

98
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:46,099
it's cuz I'm from San Francisco

99
00:04:46,099 --> 00:04:49,969
originally but anyways so what this is

100
00:04:49,969 --> 00:04:55,779
is an analog video synthesizer and and

101
00:04:55,779 --> 00:04:58,969
basically it's a bunch of boxes some

102
00:04:58,969 --> 00:05:02,479
boxes create a signal by the time that

103
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:03,919
signal gets to the screen on the right

104
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:08,689
the pattern of the signal creates a

105
00:05:08,689 --> 00:05:12,139
pattern and the boxes are designed in

106
00:05:12,139 --> 00:05:14,210
such a way that many of the boxes can

107
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:16,340
receive a signal and transform it and

108
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:18,590
then so the order in which you connect

109
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:22,639
the boxes will affect what comes out on

110
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:26,990
the the final screen and this is similar

111
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:30,169
in analog modular synthesis for audio as

112
00:05:30,169 --> 00:05:33,589
well as analog modular synthesis for

113
00:05:33,589 --> 00:05:36,169
video and so I thought what if we kind

114
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:40,339
of treat this thing this thing kind of

115
00:05:40,339 --> 00:05:44,360
like like this thing instead of thinking

116
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:47,300
of of a website as actually a place what

117
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:49,580
if we think about it as a bouncing

118
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:52,819
signal that we can play around with and

119
00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:54,949
so so I started experimenting with this

120
00:05:54,949 --> 00:05:57,080
idea about two and a half years ago or

121
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:02,620
something and so what this is is

122
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:07,039
basically here I'm using WebRTC to send

123
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:10,370
a video signal between various browser

124
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:15,819
windows so here I'm sending this in this

125
00:06:15,819 --> 00:06:19,879
video to this window and compositing

126
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:21,169
them with each other and then I'm

127
00:06:21,169 --> 00:06:24,050
sending this video in this video here

128
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:26,719
and compositing them with each other

129
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:29,750
over here and these are all happened to

130
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:31,490
be on the same computer to kind of show

131
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:34,639
the idea but they could be you know when

132
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:36,770
one window could be in China and one

133
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:40,250
somewhere else one here but this is I

134
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:41,629
don't know why this was interesting to

135
00:06:41,629 --> 00:06:42,350
me it was just

136
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:44,270
let me explore this idea and because I

137
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:45,590
didn't know what I wanted to do with it

138
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:47,810
instead of actually making a user

139
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:50,480
interface as I was experimenting with it

140
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:53,990
I just live coded in the console kind of

141
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:56,650
playing around with different things and

142
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:59,360
seeing what happened just with this sort

143
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:04,820
of routing video streams and throughout

144
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:05,740
the Internet

145
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:16,439
[Music]

146
00:07:16,449 --> 00:07:21,870
yeah

147
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:25,090
and so Daniel sand in the creator of

148
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:28,180
that synthesizer that I was just showing

149
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:33,820
key he said the modules are designed to

150
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:35,350
maximize the possibility of

151
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:37,330
interconnection thereby maximizing the

152
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:39,700
number of possible modifications of the

153
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:41,920
image and so the idea his idea is that

154
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,990
the more of those boxes that you have in

155
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:45,850
the modular synthesizer the more you can

156
00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:47,830
route signals maybe the more

157
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:57,670
possibilities you have so now I'm going

158
00:07:57,670 --> 00:08:02,200
to move into the the tool that I've been

159
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,270
building to experiment with this this

160
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:04,840
idea

161
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:10,480
it's called Hydra and it's at that link

162
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,220
I showed earlier called Hydra editor

163
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:18,220
glitch that me and so it's designed to

164
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:19,870
let people experiment with with what I

165
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:22,690
was just showing you not just within by

166
00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:25,450
sending video to different windows but

167
00:08:25,450 --> 00:08:27,670
also just all within the same video with

168
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:31,150
it within the same window I mean and so

169
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:33,880
I'm actually gonna get rid of what's on

170
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:44,080
the screen and so the basic unit within

171
00:08:44,080 --> 00:09:08,590
this is is an oscillator

172
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:11,780
okay so here we have an oscillator which

173
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:14,360
is like one of those boxes in the

174
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:19,820
modular synth world and then in order to

175
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:21,650
see it I need to connect it to a screen

176
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:26,180
so here's I connected the oscillator to

177
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:29,150
an output and you can think of in this

178
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:31,340
case this is a JavaScript library that

179
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:34,160
I've created for working with this model

180
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:37,100
of sort of video synthesis and and you

181
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:39,020
can think of each function as if it's

182
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:41,180
one of those boxes that we're seeing in

183
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:44,420
the modular synthesis world so now that

184
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:46,640
I have an oscillator I can give it

185
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:53,210
certain parameters like frequency sync

186
00:09:53,210 --> 00:10:00,240
and also separate the colors somewhat

187
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:05,300
and then I can also start to transform

188
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:11,750
the signal so psy can make it rotate so

189
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:21,000
here I can make it rotate more

190
00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:25,860
I can make it into a kaleidoscope

191
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:39,880
for example or I can pixelate it

192
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:41,450
[Music]

193
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:47,420
and so so here sort of the analogies are

194
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:50,910
each each function is is one of the

195
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:52,860
boxes in the modular synthesizer each

196
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,810
parameter is kind of like a knob and

197
00:10:54,810 --> 00:10:57,330
then the chaining of the functions acts

198
00:10:57,330 --> 00:10:59,400
like the patching cables for people more

199
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,260
from who are familiar with my dealer

200
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:05,010
synthesizers and this is this is

201
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:06,810
interesting to me this is all running on

202
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:08,640
WebGL and this chain of functions

203
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:12,090
renders to a single shader and I was

204
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:16,050
interested I think a lot of abstractions

205
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:18,870
for dealing with graphics either talk

206
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:21,720
about canvas like which you use a lot of

207
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:24,540
drawing metaphors so there's a canvas

208
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:27,770
you draw a shape you draw another shape

209
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:31,200
or they use sort of 3d metaphors like a

210
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:36,030
lot of what we just saw which is a box

211
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:41,460
lighting a scene and so here I'm using

212
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:44,730
this other metaphor which is the video

213
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:47,190
synthesis and transforming a signal

214
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:49,320
metaphor and so with this if you want to

215
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,780
repeat something instead of writing a

216
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:53,580
loop and saying I'm gonna do it now a

217
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:55,890
hundred times I just apply a

218
00:11:55,890 --> 00:11:59,280
transformation so here I could do repeat

219
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:05,280
and so I I could do it two times or I

220
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:10,770
could do it 200 times and it's not more

221
00:12:10,770 --> 00:12:12,990
problem it's not more intensive for the

222
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:14,910
process for the processor at all because

223
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:17,190
they're just transformations to the

224
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:19,140
coordinates directly on the graphics

225
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:22,230
card and the result outputs a pixel

226
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:26,880
color and so that's all well and good

227
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,430
but this is just sort of a single chain

228
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:32,940
of things and so what I was really

229
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:34,620
interested in for that mess of cables

230
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:36,360
and how things were out into each other

231
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:41,700
and so what I can do here is I can have

232
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:45,150
various various sort of output screens

233
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:51,750
and so here and I can also use different

234
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:52,930
sources and

235
00:12:52,930 --> 00:13:02,320
I'm gonna use my webcam here so they're

236
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:05,290
there you actually want to put this over

237
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:08,170
there and that over here and so now I

238
00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:13,810
have I have my two my two screens and I

239
00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:18,250
can then also blend them together so I

240
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:21,520
have one output called a zero and one

241
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:23,560
called oh one so then they can now say

242
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:27,430
I'm gonna use a zero I'm gonna blend it

243
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:30,160
with a one and then I'm gonna output it

244
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:36,760
- OH - and so then there I am and

245
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:40,120
there's some different sort of blending

246
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:43,209
operations here wait I'll make this a

247
00:13:43,209 --> 00:13:54,040
little and so one other thing that I

248
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:58,120
sort of took from modular synthesizers

249
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:00,459
either what happened what's happening

250
00:14:00,459 --> 00:14:04,300
now is I'm combining two colors and the

251
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:06,160
two colors of the two images on the Left

252
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:09,790
create the colors on the right but I

253
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:11,830
could also use the colors of one thing

254
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:14,380
to affect the coordinates of the other

255
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:18,850
thing and so that in the analog world is

256
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:25,470
called modulation and so I can I do that

257
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:29,230
so now you it's the colors of the thing

258
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:33,190
on the top are affecting the coordinates

259
00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:35,770
of my camera so it ends up with this

260
00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:45,160
kind of were P thing and so hi everyone

261
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:53,649
I repeat myself and so this is just

262
00:14:53,649 --> 00:14:56,920
something I I made this to experiment

263
00:14:56,920 --> 00:15:03,930
with and a lot of and also back to the

264
00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:06,390
image showing all the windows still if

265
00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:08,550
anyone else is connected to this website

266
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:11,640
I can use what they're doing as an input

267
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:14,520
to what I'm doing which is sort of just

268
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:17,820
an experiment of of what happens when we

269
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:20,520
combine images in this way and then some

270
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:21,839
of the other things I've experimented

271
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:24,540
with of this this is like using the

272
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:26,670
screen as an input to itself when

273
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:30,140
creating feedback and this sort of

274
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:38,940
trippy thing oi here I'm using my

275
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:44,550
Twitter feed and and also sources and

276
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:46,830
the software can either be someone else

277
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:49,140
who's connected they can be a camera it

278
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:52,800
can be any browser window or it can be

279
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:56,130
any application window or it can be a

280
00:15:56,130 --> 00:16:01,380
canvas element and so here here this is

281
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:04,110
my Twitter feed with some video effects

282
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:10,110
applied to it or this I use a live

283
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:13,500
stream of Time Square and a live stream

284
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:18,240
of an aquarium and then live coded the

285
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:21,150
mix between the two and and this for me

286
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:22,050
it's really just an ongoing

287
00:16:22,050 --> 00:16:24,060
investigation of trying something out

288
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:25,529
and seeing what happens and trying

289
00:16:25,529 --> 00:16:43,590
something else out

290
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:48,340
and another experiment this was using a

291
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:52,880
chromium with no background and so I

292
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,980
could actually just use my desktop as

293
00:16:54,980 --> 00:17:00,770
input to this video synthesizer but with

294
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:03,950
without without having windows so that

295
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:26,760
was just a fun experiment I think

296
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:29,200
and so one of the interesting things to

297
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,090
me with this sort of setup is to be able

298
00:17:31,090 --> 00:17:33,610
to make it easy to experiment with

299
00:17:33,610 --> 00:17:37,660
feedback which in in the video world

300
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:42,010
feedback is where you have a camera and

301
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:43,540
the output of the camera goes to a

302
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:46,120
screen and then the camera is looking at

303
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:50,710
that screen itself and so there's no at

304
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:52,179
some point there's no starting point

305
00:17:52,179 --> 00:17:54,340
because the image of the camera is on

306
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:56,590
the screen and the image of the screen

307
00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:58,900
is what's coming out of the camera which

308
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:01,120
is similar to recursion in programming

309
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:06,670
or some of Escher's asurs drawings or in

310
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:08,770
the 10th century the snake that eats its

311
00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:11,530
own tail so it's the this idea of things

312
00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:15,270
that that don't necessarily have a start

313
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:17,950
so I'm going to show a very quick

314
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:22,000
example of that here it's also can be

315
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:27,010
useful for making fractals and so here

316
00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:30,220
I'm just gonna output a shape can you

317
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:32,580
see my code or should I make it bigger

318
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:36,160
it's good okay so here here I have a

319
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:40,270
shape and then I'm gonna blend the

320
00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:45,700
output of that with with itself so the

321
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:47,550
output here is called a zero we'll just

322
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:52,110
trust me on that I guess

323
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:53,770
so I'm gonna blend the output with

324
00:18:53,770 --> 00:18:56,710
itself and we don't actually see any

325
00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:58,630
difference because we're drawing a

326
00:18:58,630 --> 00:19:02,200
triangle and then we're mixing it with

327
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:07,720
itself again which is a triangle but I

328
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:10,720
could after each time I mix the whole

329
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:15,730
thing repeat repeat it and then mix it

330
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:17,650
with itself again and so to do that with

331
00:19:17,650 --> 00:19:25,150
this I could just do repeat and we get a

332
00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:28,470
sort of fractal like thing which is

333
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:30,880
something that at different scales is a

334
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:35,500
repetition of itself and

335
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:37,430
it's something that's I'm just playing

336
00:19:37,430 --> 00:19:38,870
around with it's really interesting with

337
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:42,410
this kind of set of obstructions is to

338
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:45,530
be able to in only four functions kind

339
00:19:45,530 --> 00:19:54,470
of describe describe a fractal we're

340
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:59,070
gonna do one more little little demo

341
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:10,260
[Music]

342
00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:13,230
I'm going to start with the camera again

343
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:19,059
hi that's my face very big and then I'm

344
00:20:19,059 --> 00:20:25,150
gonna blend it with the output and then

345
00:20:25,150 --> 00:20:28,120
I'm gonna use that modulate function

346
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:30,760
that I just showed you where the colors

347
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:32,950
of one thing affect the coordinates of

348
00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:47,080
another thing and so here

349
00:20:47,090 --> 00:20:53,360
so I get this sort of liquidy thing and

350
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:56,490
they could add a little more contrast

351
00:20:56,490 --> 00:21:12,120
maybe let's see maybe a little more and

352
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:16,289
so it turns out that that feedback is

353
00:21:16,289 --> 00:21:20,700
useful for modeling MA for modeling

354
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:23,370
things like fluid dynamics as well

355
00:21:23,370 --> 00:21:28,980
because you can think of the colors of

356
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:30,750
the texture as sort of a representation

357
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:34,620
of pressure and then on each each loop

358
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:38,100
sort of effect the system using using

359
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:46,409
colors so yeah some things I've made

360
00:21:46,409 --> 00:21:50,070
like experimenting with this just this

361
00:21:50,070 --> 00:22:09,900
pretty simple simple setup

362
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:12,050
also it can be useful for creating

363
00:22:12,050 --> 00:22:40,899
reaction diffusion like like patterns

364
00:22:40,909 --> 00:22:44,299
so one thing that the creator of that

365
00:22:44,299 --> 00:22:46,519
modular synthesizer that I showed at the

366
00:22:46,519 --> 00:22:51,440
beginning talked about he talked about

367
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,479
the idea of this feedback loop which has

368
00:22:53,479 --> 00:22:57,799
had sometimes like a mystical mystical

369
00:22:57,799 --> 00:22:59,269
implications at different moments in

370
00:22:59,269 --> 00:23:01,070
history but he says the reason you put

371
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:02,570
yourself in a feedback loop is so you

372
00:23:02,570 --> 00:23:04,159
can learn something or rather learn to

373
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:06,229
do something you know you do something

374
00:23:06,229 --> 00:23:07,789
in the results get processed somehow

375
00:23:07,789 --> 00:23:09,679
perhaps just by yourself just looking at

376
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:11,509
it and you do another thing and the

377
00:23:11,509 --> 00:23:13,309
results of that get process and your

378
00:23:13,309 --> 00:23:15,889
actions can cause constantly be tuned or

379
00:23:15,889 --> 00:23:17,960
corrected or refined by what you see and

380
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:20,299
and something that happens with playing

381
00:23:20,299 --> 00:23:21,950
with these systems that can be kind of

382
00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:24,950
delicate is that even though I know

383
00:23:24,950 --> 00:23:27,440
exactly what each function does at the

384
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,899
moment of playing with it a lot of times

385
00:23:29,899 --> 00:23:32,299
a really unexpected thing can happen

386
00:23:32,299 --> 00:23:35,149
like like in this example if I make one

387
00:23:35,149 --> 00:23:37,070
of these variables just change one

388
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:39,710
number maybe it makes it really it goes

389
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:43,220
away now and so it can be really

390
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:47,239
delicate and so being able to live code

391
00:23:47,239 --> 00:23:50,539
it or - I'm actually executing parts of

392
00:23:50,539 --> 00:23:53,330
the code at a time and being able to

393
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:56,389
code it see the results code it see the

394
00:23:56,389 --> 00:23:59,349
results to me is is very similar to

395
00:23:59,349 --> 00:24:01,609
putting yourself in that feedback loop

396
00:24:01,609 --> 00:24:04,669
with which in an analog world is like

397
00:24:04,669 --> 00:24:09,169
patching cables together and so part of

398
00:24:09,169 --> 00:24:10,519
this is that since I put this online

399
00:24:10,519 --> 00:24:12,799
about a year ago a lot of people have

400
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:15,019
started to use it and I still feel like

401
00:24:15,019 --> 00:24:17,989
I'm learning to use it myself and so one

402
00:24:17,989 --> 00:24:19,759
of the things I wanted to do is make it

403
00:24:19,759 --> 00:24:22,519
easy for people to share to share what

404
00:24:22,519 --> 00:24:26,119
they're doing and so there's a Twitter

405
00:24:26,119 --> 00:24:30,200
bot uh-huh and basically this is it kind

406
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:33,109
of instead of having to pay for hosting

407
00:24:33,109 --> 00:24:36,070
and have people upload images they're

408
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:40,039
basically directly from the editor we

409
00:24:40,039 --> 00:24:42,320
can upload an image to the Twitter bot

410
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:46,039
so here and I'm gonna say J s comm

411
00:24:46,039 --> 00:24:51,440
Hawaii yeah and then now it should

412
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:52,909
upload what I do

413
00:24:52,909 --> 00:24:59,479
did to the Twitter bot let's see there

414
00:24:59,479 --> 00:25:02,769
we are and so what happens is when you

415
00:25:02,769 --> 00:25:05,869
when you click on a link here then it

416
00:25:05,869 --> 00:25:07,940
opens the editor with the actual code

417
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:11,840
that someone used to make it and so so

418
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:14,840
to me since I started making this about

419
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:19,249
a year ago it's become now there's

420
00:25:19,249 --> 00:25:22,009
probably like 200 people using it and so

421
00:25:22,009 --> 00:25:24,950
part of it is that the software also

422
00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:27,259
becomes a community and part of it is

423
00:25:27,259 --> 00:25:28,809
how the things that I've been building

424
00:25:28,809 --> 00:25:31,999
into the software can help people share

425
00:25:31,999 --> 00:25:36,259
what they're doing and so so in the

426
00:25:36,259 --> 00:25:39,139
Twitter bot you can also see this what

427
00:25:39,139 --> 00:25:42,229
this happened came from what someone

428
00:25:42,229 --> 00:25:44,179
else did earlier and this came what so

429
00:25:44,179 --> 00:25:50,739
from what someone else did earlier and

430
00:25:50,739 --> 00:25:54,080
this is also something I perform I'm

431
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:58,009
live with it there's a community of

432
00:25:58,009 --> 00:26:01,279
people who do something called live

433
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:04,609
coding which people do within the tech

434
00:26:04,609 --> 00:26:06,409
world but also they do it more within a

435
00:26:06,409 --> 00:26:09,320
music of the music world that which is

436
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:12,409
write code in front of people to make to

437
00:26:12,409 --> 00:26:15,799
make audio visuals and so there's a

438
00:26:15,799 --> 00:26:18,859
website of people who are interested in

439
00:26:18,859 --> 00:26:21,679
this kind of thing of of live coding as

440
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:23,899
a performer as an audio-visual

441
00:26:23,899 --> 00:26:29,840
performance and so and I view some of it

442
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:33,109
as sort of a direct descendant of the

443
00:26:33,109 --> 00:26:35,509
the video synth idea of putting yourself

444
00:26:35,509 --> 00:26:38,119
in a feedback loop this is one of the

445
00:26:38,119 --> 00:26:42,229
creators or the original the first

446
00:26:42,229 --> 00:26:44,169
people to do live coding as a

447
00:26:44,169 --> 00:26:46,009
performance thing and he had a live

448
00:26:46,009 --> 00:26:48,859
coding band called slub in the in 2003

449
00:26:48,859 --> 00:26:52,039
and and said he was heavily influenced

450
00:26:52,039 --> 00:26:55,249
by reading paul Cleese pedagogical

451
00:26:55,249 --> 00:26:56,779
sketch I'm not going to read this

452
00:26:56,779 --> 00:26:59,560
booklet but

453
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:03,020
but the idea of live coding is sort of

454
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:04,940
an exploration in which you're trying

455
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:06,410
something out the computer does

456
00:27:06,410 --> 00:27:08,150
something you respond the computer does

457
00:27:08,150 --> 00:27:09,980
something else and you're sharing that

458
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:14,240
with a with a live audience so thank you
