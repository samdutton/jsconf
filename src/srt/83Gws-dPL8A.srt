00:00:00,319 --> 00:00:05,330

everybody how's everybody doing today

2
00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:09,990
that's me that's the stock all right so

3
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:11,309
I'm gonna talk about the future but

4
00:00:11,309 --> 00:00:13,400
first we're gonna talk about the 90s

5
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:16,740
bait-and-switch I actually used to live

6
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:19,340
up here in the 90s I grew up up here and

7
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:21,750
the fashion just hasn't changed at all

8
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:24,630
it was it's just sweat shirts and fleece

9
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:27,869
from REI back in the 90s there'd be like

10
00:00:27,869 --> 00:00:29,310
some neon windbreakers but it's

11
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:34,530
basically the same so back in the 90s

12
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:36,300
there was actually like this real fight

13
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:38,579
like kind of a war over what the future

14
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:40,860
of the internet would look like there

15
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:42,690
wasn't really an established application

16
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:43,290
platform

17
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:45,660
it was globally accessible and the view

18
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:47,640
of a lot of people including like vast

19
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,050
majority of the tech industry actually

20
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:51,180
and Bill Gates was that you would have

21
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:52,620
this thing that bill liked to call the

22
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:54,120
information superhighway which was like

23
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,010
you would just connect to companies

24
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:57,840
products and they would all be like

25
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,670
unique and then you would download their

26
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:01,230
software and then connect to like their

27
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:04,470
backends and stuff to think about it now

28
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:06,659
it sounds relatively dystopic like you

29
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:08,100
had just connected these corporate sites

30
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:10,530
and get their content but like AOL was

31
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:11,939
like the most successful version of this

32
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:13,920
right which was it was a content portal

33
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,020
and rather than using the web you would

34
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:19,170
use this content portal and everybody

35
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:21,330
thought that this was gonna win not a

36
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:22,350
lot of people thought in the web was

37
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:23,670
gonna win and if you're looking at them

38
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:25,500
like yeah you can kind of see why like

39
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:26,790
this is a little more useable like

40
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:28,920
there's a taxonomy I can click on things

41
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,320
that I can do and like what is over here

42
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:33,750
and they had this amazing thing called

43
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:35,369
like keywords so like if I was like hey

44
00:01:35,369 --> 00:01:37,409
I have this awesome website so you type

45
00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:42,630
like HTTP colon slash slash and like the

46
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:44,100
browser's were dumb they would not fill

47
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:48,210
this in for you and and then uh Oprah

48
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:49,829
like every day on her show would get up

49
00:01:49,829 --> 00:01:51,149
there and Oprah would be like yes

50
00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:54,720
keyword Oprah look it up on AOL and then

51
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,790
you get all this content from Oprah on

52
00:01:56,790 --> 00:01:58,920
AOL like of course this is gonna win

53
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,700
Oprah is gonna win we're not gonna win

54
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:05,040
and just like I'm generally better

55
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,229
experience but the thing that ended up

56
00:02:07,229 --> 00:02:09,479
happening is that the web had this thing

57
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:12,060
called URLs and then people who publish

58
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:12,560
them

59
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,110
would link to other people's URLs and

60
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:16,940
that seems like a really simple thing

61
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:18,080
and it's like this primitive that we

62
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,930
really take for granted but like the if

63
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:22,569
you wanted to publish something on AOL

64
00:02:22,569 --> 00:02:25,370
your first step was like be Oprah and

65
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:29,000
then step two was like pay people to put

66
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,610
up content on the web like anybody can

67
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:33,260
get an earl and you can put up stuff and

68
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:34,459
then you can link to other people's

69
00:02:34,459 --> 00:02:37,040
stuff and even though worlds were much

70
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:40,370
worse to stay than keywords they allow

71
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:42,230
these kinds of network effects to happen

72
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:43,310
because you can link to other people's

73
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:45,830
stuff so like I make my Oprah blog we

74
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:47,180
didn't have blogs in the 90s but you get

75
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:47,950
my point

76
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:50,269
and then like somebody like publishes

77
00:02:50,269 --> 00:02:51,920
their list of favorite Oprah sites and

78
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,450
somebody makes an Oprah web ring and

79
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:55,700
this all kind of piles on together and

80
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:57,680
eventually what you end up with is this

81
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,019
big network graph of different people

82
00:03:00,019 --> 00:03:03,620
providing different content and so Oprah

83
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:07,310
is content on a o L was a lot better

84
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:09,080
than like any one person's favorite

85
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:11,600
blogs or anything like that but when you

86
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,640
take the entire value of this big

87
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:15,319
network and all this activity that's

88
00:03:15,319 --> 00:03:16,489
happening and all this exponential

89
00:03:16,489 --> 00:03:17,959
growth of this network around all that

90
00:03:17,959 --> 00:03:19,670
content it just doesn't even compare

91
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:21,350
anymore to the content that you had

92
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:23,329
inside of these portals and so these

93
00:03:23,329 --> 00:03:25,400
network effects are effectively why the

94
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:28,130
web one and when we when we go to

95
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:30,410
compare the value of AOL and all just

96
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:32,209
like really high end well published

97
00:03:32,209 --> 00:03:34,310
content we're comparing it to this the

98
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:37,010
value of the web which is like this huge

99
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:39,140
exponentially growing graph of data and

100
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:42,920
value that's why the web one and I think

101
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:45,290
that is really easy today to forget

102
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:46,790
about these primitives and why they were

103
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:48,820
so important we really need to unwind

104
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:51,380
our view of the web today when we think

105
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:52,910
about the web we think about standards

106
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:54,950
and browsers and web frameworks and

107
00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:56,870
JavaScript and like that is all very

108
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:59,600
important and like I you know I did no

109
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,489
js' stuff for nine years I think that

110
00:04:01,489 --> 00:04:03,680
like javascript is very important I

111
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,630
serve on the node foundation it is a

112
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:09,019
very important thing but if we're

113
00:04:09,019 --> 00:04:10,549
thinking about what are the current

114
00:04:10,549 --> 00:04:13,100
limitations of the web and what are the

115
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:14,630
primitives that we need in order to move

116
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:16,609
forward we really need to come back to

117
00:04:16,609 --> 00:04:18,440
the basics and unwind and think about

118
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:22,060
URLs and links so this is an earl and

119
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:24,470
there's basically three distinct parts

120
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:25,810
there's a transport

121
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:28,090
and authority and then a reference to

122
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:30,190
the content they're getting and you can

123
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:32,590
sort of think about this backwards right

124
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:34,960
first you name content that you're going

125
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,400
to publish so you create some kind of

126
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,950
name for it or like an index then

127
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:41,740
there's the who who do I ask for on the

128
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:44,110
internet for this content right and then

129
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:46,360
the transport says like how I ask this

130
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,730
person for that content and so when I

131
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:50,530
link to somebody else's site I'm

132
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:52,090
actually giving them a central location

133
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:53,889
to go and look this up I'm saying go to

134
00:04:53,889 --> 00:04:55,960
this authority and ask somebody for this

135
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:58,360
content right and that's that's the base

136
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:00,370
primitive that we built everything for

137
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:03,460
the last 20 years on centralization is

138
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:05,350
baked into that primitive right

139
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:08,050
it's federated in in a general sense but

140
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:10,360
like the whole web is federated but

141
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,220
every individual actor is actually

142
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:15,220
centralized so web locations are more

143
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:16,540
than just static assets in the browser

144
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:19,750
right static assets in the browser I can

145
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:21,400
manipulate they're part of the open web

146
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,620
like I can and do change like everything

147
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:24,750
in facebook

148
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:26,740
sorry I don't really go to Facebook but

149
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:29,979
Twitter like I remove all the ads I

150
00:05:29,979 --> 00:05:31,690
change words that make me stressed out

151
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:33,460
like Trump to things that don't stress

152
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:35,470
me out like daisies like it's just you

153
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:36,850
know I have like a series of dumb

154
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:38,200
extensions to just change everything

155
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,630
about that experience the problem though

156
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:42,700
is that like Twitter and and modern web

157
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:44,020
applications in general aren't just

158
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:45,700
these static assets they pull

159
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:49,990
information out of AP eyes and those AP

160
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:51,820
eyes are addressed by those URLs they're

161
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:53,590
like in these central locations I can't

162
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:54,910
just replace it the way that I can

163
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:56,470
replace stuff that's in my browser and

164
00:05:56,470 --> 00:05:59,740
so this means that data centralization

165
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:02,470
is baked in to multi-user applications

166
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:04,780
on the web today there just isn't a good

167
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:07,180
way for me to go and build an

168
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:09,160
application that multiple users interact

169
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,160
with and have relationships between

170
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,600
those peoples data without just

171
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,460
centralizing in an entire content silo

172
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:17,830
and putting an API in front of it so

173
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:19,930
this is one of the largest cost drivers

174
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:21,370
of modern applications it makes them

175
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:23,950
expensive like Brian's talking at the

176
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:25,479
beginning of the day was brilliant

177
00:06:25,479 --> 00:06:27,340
because you know it really is pennies

178
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:29,169
now to just run thousands of function

179
00:06:29,169 --> 00:06:31,150
executions in the cloud but if you log

180
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:32,830
like a little bit of data from all of

181
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:35,400
those calls the storage cost of the

182
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:38,040
is more expensive than the processing of

183
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:40,080
the actual cloud functions storage

184
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,639
actually still does cost money and

185
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:44,190
unlike lot functions that like Evan flow

186
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:46,320
with like how active your website is

187
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,300
storage only really increases over time

188
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:50,400
it's why it's such a good business to be

189
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:56,280
in like we're here so but the the

190
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:58,470
biggest problem that we really have with

191
00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:01,050
with these data silos isn't just it like

192
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:02,520
we can't get our data out of them or

193
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04,380
that they're opaque which they are it's

194
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:07,080
that they you have to basically build an

195
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:09,630
ad model to support most large websites

196
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:12,419
and that again comes back to URLs and

197
00:07:12,419 --> 00:07:15,360
links if I want to benefit from the

198
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,190
network effects of the web I have to be

199
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:19,440
a link you to my content which means

200
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,669
that my content has to be publicly

201
00:07:20,669 --> 00:07:22,860
accessible it can't be behind a paywall

202
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:25,440
so like any application that gets

203
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,030
popular enough through these network

204
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:28,979
effects is gonna have to be ad supported

205
00:07:28,979 --> 00:07:32,060
in order to fund all these costs

206
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:34,770
eventually these a driven businesses

207
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:36,180
started to get smarter and smarter they

208
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:37,349
started to adopt a lot of really good

209
00:07:37,349 --> 00:07:38,880
machine learning and new algorithms and

210
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,680
eventually what they figured out is that

211
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,300
the best way to capture your attention

212
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:44,400
for the longest amount of time is to

213
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,960
keep moving you towards more and more

214
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:48,660
extreme content and so you're

215
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:50,699
effectively radicalizing people like on

216
00:07:50,699 --> 00:07:52,440
purpose because it's a very good way to

217
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,440
keep you watching YouTube like forever

218
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:57,720
and our current like we don't we just

219
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:00,270
have no recourse right like the people

220
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:01,620
in this room are developers like me

221
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:03,389
we're going to build the next version of

222
00:08:03,389 --> 00:08:05,940
one of these applications and we have no

223
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:07,830
other tool than to build it the same way

224
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:09,419
that we've always built it and end up

225
00:08:09,419 --> 00:08:11,370
with all the exact same problems again

226
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:13,169
our only other resources literally to

227
00:08:13,169 --> 00:08:14,729
yell at billionaires and try to ask them

228
00:08:14,729 --> 00:08:16,289
to change their algorithms to make less

229
00:08:16,289 --> 00:08:17,849
money like they didn't become

230
00:08:17,849 --> 00:08:19,770
billionaires by making less money off of

231
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:20,970
these algorithms is just not gonna

232
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:27,750
happen so anyway let's like so like how

233
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:29,400
do we even start to address this problem

234
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,680
it seems like very very like huge and it

235
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,940
is I've spent like 10 years trying to

236
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:35,190
think about it and here's the real issue

237
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:36,900
right so we have a web application it

238
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:39,390
talks to like multiple api's those api

239
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:41,310
is end up talking to databases and other

240
00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:43,320
storage solutions and like I've written

241
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,000
databases like a bunch of them from

242
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,370
quite a while now and what a database

243
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:48,690
does really is that it take

244
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:50,700
the serialization of like your data

245
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:52,820
structure and then it stores it on disk

246
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:55,470
and it stores it on disk with a bunch of

247
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:57,240
other computers usually in a network and

248
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,980
it makes guarantees about the state of

249
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:01,350
that data the thing that you you

250
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:02,340
probably don't even realize as a

251
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:03,570
developer because you kind of take it

252
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:05,760
for granted is that there are state

253
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,800
guarantees and consistency guarantees in

254
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,650
that serialization to disk that bubble

255
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:13,080
all the way up to the API and the state

256
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,640
that comes out then and then all the

257
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,900
caching layers that we build on those

258
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:18,480
api is to make them fast and so if we

259
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,640
want to like remove this API layer that

260
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,140
is so problematic and figure out how to

261
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:23,850
distribute it and decentralize that and

262
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:25,770
make it part of the open web we actually

263
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:28,290
have to go and dig all the way into

264
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:30,090
where that data gets serialized and

265
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:33,210
bring that into like into the browser

266
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:35,700
into the open web into a space that we

267
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,710
can actually work with so this will

268
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:39,360
become a little bit clearer as as I as I

269
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,240
move along but that's why we have to dig

270
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,040
so deep into this problem is because you

271
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:46,290
all of these layers in between have

272
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:47,820
consistency guarantees that bubble level

273
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,590
all the way from how you store data we

274
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:52,020
have to literally start to rethink what

275
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:53,730
happened when we have a data structure

276
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:56,940
in memory and we need to share it or to

277
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:58,710
serialize it long term like what happens

278
00:09:58,710 --> 00:10:00,300
when it leaves the space of the memory

279
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,220
of our programs that's the problem we

280
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:04,020
need to solve so we come back to the

281
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:06,210
Earle like we did the Earle has a

282
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:07,620
central authority in it we're gonna have

283
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:09,390
all the same problems so like to get rid

284
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:12,390
of the transport and the authority also

285
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:14,940
because we don't have an authority we

286
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:17,040
don't have like like the authority also

287
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,050
provides a namespace so we can't have

288
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:21,630
like these human names we go and create

289
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:28,410
the things we can do so eventually

290
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:29,670
people figure it out that you can do

291
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:31,400
this thing where you hash the content

292
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:34,290
and people have been using hashes for

293
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:37,620
very long time but every five years or

294
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:39,720
so we look at hashing and we realized

295
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,250
that there's like another problem that

296
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:43,170
we can solve with this and another whole

297
00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:44,640
scope of issues that we can solve with

298
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,170
it and so our view of what we can do

299
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:47,339
with Cooper graphic hashing keeps

300
00:10:47,339 --> 00:10:48,330
getting bigger and bigger and bigger

301
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:50,130
right and promise I'm not going to talk

302
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:54,720
about block chains so we we have so what

303
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,670
we have this primitive now called

304
00:10:56,670 --> 00:10:58,810
content address ability or content

305
00:10:58,810 --> 00:11:02,320
dressing right and the interesting thing

306
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:05,500
about content addressability is that we

307
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:09,220
get a way to address data without an

308
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:11,380
authority without a location without a

309
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:12,790
transport we can get the data from

310
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:14,740
anywhere from anybody and we have a

311
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:16,180
cryptographic guarantee that like you

312
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:18,130
told me about this hash and I got it

313
00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:22,510
from like some Rando and I looked at the

314
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:24,310
data and said Oh ad does match this hash

315
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:27,100
it's kind of brilliant and then if that

316
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:28,750
data has inside of it

317
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:32,200
other hashes then changing any of those

318
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,000
links inside of that data changes the

319
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,110
hash and so we have another

320
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:36,520
cryptographic guarantee if the day ever

321
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:42,700
changes I'm just gonna move along and

322
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:44,020
start to show some of this in practice

323
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:46,690
at this point because either you're

324
00:11:46,690 --> 00:11:48,070
following along or you're not and you're

325
00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:49,380
not gonna get it if I keep just talking

326
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:54,520
okay so a protocol out we created this

327
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:56,500
thing called a CID or content identifier

328
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,960
so CID is just a very very flexible way

329
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:01,060
to say okay we have we have a hash and

330
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:02,650
then we need to know how to interpret

331
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:04,540
that hash to get links out of it because

332
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:05,770
we're not all going to use the exact

333
00:12:05,770 --> 00:12:08,170
same data format so that's all it is so

334
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:09,640
you can think of it as like sort of like

335
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:12,100
a replacement for the earldom to graphic

336
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:15,640
hashing okay so if I want to like you

337
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:17,770
know publish my blog data and you want

338
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:19,570
to go read it you would say oh go get

339
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:21,970
this this content hash and then you

340
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:23,589
would get back this object it has my

341
00:12:23,589 --> 00:12:26,380
posts in it okay and here's here's the

342
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:28,360
fun thing it just doesn't matter how you

343
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:30,820
get this hash right like I'm not gonna

344
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:31,900
talk about a bunch of peer-to-peer

345
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:34,060
technologies and dhts and ways to get it

346
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:36,280
data because it literally doesn't matter

347
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,600
you could pull it out of a centralized

348
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,860
store you could pull it out of a local

349
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:42,250
storage cache like anyway the nobody

350
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:45,160
cares like it's all you know the same

351
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:46,600
for together guarantees so this is how

352
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,280
we can create truly decentralized data

353
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,630
structures without worrying about like

354
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:51,640
oh well did I authenticate with the

355
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:52,839
right peer-to-peer network and things

356
00:12:52,839 --> 00:12:55,690
like that anyway inside of this data

357
00:12:55,690 --> 00:12:57,279
structure I have a list of posts and

358
00:12:57,279 --> 00:12:59,560
then one of those posts just points to

359
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:02,800
another cid it's just a link right we're

360
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,779
just creating new link data just like we

361
00:13:04,779 --> 00:13:06,910
did in the internet and then when I go

362
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:10,430
and get that C ID from wherever again

363
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:12,980
I will then get the text for that post

364
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:15,470
fairly simple okay

365
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:19,009
but now Sally like has a list of her

366
00:13:19,009 --> 00:13:20,690
favorite blogs and she's like oh yeah

367
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:22,339
well Michels blog is this hash so boom

368
00:13:22,339 --> 00:13:23,660
that's in my list I'm not publishing

369
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:25,610
that data and Heather creates an

370
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:27,410
aggregator and she's like oh cool

371
00:13:27,410 --> 00:13:29,360
there's this new link now and now we're

372
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,440
starting to build some of the same

373
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,899
network effects that we had in the early

374
00:13:32,899 --> 00:13:36,529
web with links for data so all of my

375
00:13:36,529 --> 00:13:37,819
data that I publish all my tweets

376
00:13:37,819 --> 00:13:39,440
they're not just like locked up in

377
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,970
Twitter or locked up in Facebook or

378
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:42,680
wherever they're actually part of like a

379
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:44,899
completely decentralized system that

380
00:13:44,899 --> 00:13:46,250
spans the internet where anybody can

381
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:48,800
link to anybody's data so the really

382
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,319
cool thing here is like different people

383
00:13:51,319 --> 00:13:52,910
can be hosting this data right it

384
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:54,279
doesn't have to live in the same place

385
00:13:54,279 --> 00:13:56,810
if I'm only looking at Heather's

386
00:13:56,810 --> 00:13:58,399
aggregator and I don't really want to go

387
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:59,930
look at my blog I don't even have to

388
00:13:59,930 --> 00:14:03,380
resolve that link or all of this could

389
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:05,420
be on my computer because I pulled it

390
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:06,709
all down to read all of this data

391
00:14:06,709 --> 00:14:09,410
offline nothing changes in the data

392
00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:12,259
structures it's all just content

393
00:14:12,259 --> 00:14:14,209
addressed okay so let's look at like a

394
00:14:14,209 --> 00:14:16,430
more kind of real-world use case so

395
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:18,350
different universities published in

396
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:21,620
omics data different scientific data and

397
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:23,690
then people run regression analysis over

398
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:25,880
that data the way this looks today is

399
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:28,100
that they publish it in like just random

400
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:30,380
different FTP sites and tarballs and

401
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:31,279
stuff and then everybody goes and

402
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:32,660
downloads that and like different

403
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:33,980
universities try to mirror each other's

404
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:34,910
data but they all use different

405
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:36,740
protocols and it's like really really

406
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:40,040
messy so if we if we imagine this world

407
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,630
where we have content address data and

408
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:43,430
that you actually put all of that

409
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:45,769
genomics data into content dress that I

410
00:14:45,769 --> 00:14:47,480
can create a regression data set that is

411
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:50,449
also a hash they just point to all the

412
00:14:50,449 --> 00:14:51,709
hashes that I'm going to run against

413
00:14:51,709 --> 00:14:52,910
right at all of these different places

414
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:55,760
and I can pull all of that data down in

415
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,189
real time from all of these universities

416
00:14:58,189 --> 00:15:00,319
or mirrors of those universities or

417
00:15:00,319 --> 00:15:02,930
local caches again all of the sort of

418
00:15:02,930 --> 00:15:04,490
deliverability semantics are then

419
00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:07,189
removed from the data structures so we

420
00:15:07,189 --> 00:15:09,050
get a lot more reliability we get a lot

421
00:15:09,050 --> 00:15:10,790
more permanence and like archive ability

422
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:13,670
which is really important and then the

423
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:14,810
really cool thing is that when I get

424
00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:16,430
that result that regression result that

425
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:18,860
ran across that entire data set I can

426
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:20,959
point down at individual parts of the

427
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:23,360
data right like the same way that you

428
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:23,810
would put

429
00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:25,190
like look down and look at individual

430
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:27,290
posts I can look at you know this is

431
00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:28,610
just a part of the genomics data that

432
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:31,430
match some query that I had and again I

433
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:33,920
can pull down all that data and riho

434
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,260
stit and republish it but actually my

435
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:37,340
data structure is the only thing that I

436
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:38,690
worry about need to worry about being

437
00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:40,550
published and staying alive all of these

438
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:42,500
links they go off to other places those

439
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,029
are in the network those exist I don't

440
00:15:44,029 --> 00:15:46,100
have to Rijo s-- them I'm just adding

441
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:49,220
new value to or and also deriving value

442
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:52,510
from the data that's in the network

443
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:54,529
similarly like let's imagine like a

444
00:15:54,529 --> 00:15:55,790
Twitter that's built on you centralized

445
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:58,520
data structures so Bob Alice and Sally

446
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:00,589
and Heather are all publishing their

447
00:16:00,589 --> 00:16:03,410
feeds somewhere and my feed is just a

448
00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:05,089
pointer to all of their feeds that's

449
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:06,950
what I'm looking at right and my

450
00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:09,740
favorites is just pointing to all the

451
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:11,420
individual treats inside of their data

452
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:13,310
structures and now they're hosting them

453
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:15,410
or I'm hosting them or it doesn't matter

454
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:18,380
right that's kind of the point and of

455
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:20,089
course this data structure is the exact

456
00:16:20,089 --> 00:16:23,060
this looks exactly like a slide from a

457
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:24,380
little bit ago even though these data

458
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:27,140
structures are completely different like

459
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:28,670
the way that we would want to do you

460
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:29,900
know genomics data and the way that we

461
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:31,550
would do tweets looks very different

462
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:33,500
from like you know the actual data

463
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:36,290
structures point of view but I'm able to

464
00:16:36,290 --> 00:16:37,760
display it in the same way here because

465
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:39,560
it's all built on this same really

466
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:41,720
really tiny primitive this continent in

467
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:46,550
the fire so CID is a pointer that spans

468
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:48,920
the internet essentially you can think

469
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,210
about it like when you're building data

470
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:51,470
structures and you're building B trees

471
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:52,970
like if you've you know had a Google

472
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:55,930
interview and then never done that again

473
00:16:55,930 --> 00:16:59,210
you you have pointers to data it's like

474
00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:01,640
a very simple programming concept but if

475
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:02,839
you think about a pointer that can span

476
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:04,220
the internet then now you can imagine

477
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:05,689
building out data structures like B

478
00:17:05,689 --> 00:17:08,089
trees that span more than just you know

479
00:17:08,089 --> 00:17:09,650
the memory space inside of my hard drive

480
00:17:09,650 --> 00:17:12,709
and also don't just span you know a

481
00:17:12,709 --> 00:17:14,750
particular data silo for a particular

482
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:17,920
website as quote as me I said done smart

483
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:21,890
so so but at the end of the day what we

484
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:24,829
end up with is a network of data this

485
00:17:24,829 --> 00:17:27,199
hugely giant valuable network of data

486
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:29,270
write effectively like an Internet of

487
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:31,760
data just built on this simple primitive

488
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,820
right

489
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:36,640
now if you start to imagine all this

490
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,110
data out there existing all these people

491
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:41,710
building value on top of it you stop

492
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:44,890
trying to compare this to a particular

493
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:48,280
Amazon offering or this to Facebook or

494
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:49,630
this to Twitter right

495
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:52,660
those are huge applications it's hard to

496
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:54,160
imagine anybody ever competing with them

497
00:17:54,160 --> 00:18:00,010
but just like my a hotel blog was not

498
00:18:00,010 --> 00:18:02,620
competing or sorry my Oprah blog was not

499
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:05,230
competing with Oprah's content the whole

500
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:06,940
network was competing with that content

501
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:09,010
in the same way if we're creating this

502
00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:10,270
internet a data and deriving all of this

503
00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:12,580
value those old applications that are

504
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:14,080
locked up in data silos are actually

505
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,700
competing with the entire value of the

506
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:18,340
network that means that we can actually

507
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:20,200
win we can actually like move all of

508
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,300
this data and start moving our next

509
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:24,070
application basis all into this new

510
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:26,800
model where we're not locked up in all

511
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,150
these companies and all these data silos

512
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:30,910
anymore so that's the vision that we

513
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:32,680
have that we're trying to build I'm

514
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,270
working on that a protocol labs a lot of

515
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:35,110
people are working on this a lot of

516
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:36,460
people are working looking at content or

517
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:39,820
disability where it's like the earliest

518
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:42,460
days ever like we are still implementing

519
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:44,080
fundamental data structures we're doing

520
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,180
a lot of new research and new work if

521
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:47,890
you're really interested in this I would

522
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:50,560
like really encourage you to go check

523
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:52,480
out this spec repository this is

524
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,280
probably like the best list of grammar

525
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:57,400
and current work that we have like in

526
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,990
like a more human readable format and

527
00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:00,610
we're of course working in like a lot of

528
00:19:00,610 --> 00:19:02,770
new content and then on top of these

529
00:19:02,770 --> 00:19:04,390
data structures we built things like IP

530
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:06,970
FS the interplanetary file system which

531
00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:08,410
can move your files around and all of

532
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:09,910
that I peeled d stands for

533
00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:11,830
interplanetary linked data yeah because

534
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:15,490
we we love acronyms that immediately

535
00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:17,770
make the intergalactic sonbai Beastie

536
00:19:17,770 --> 00:19:21,880
Boys playing my head so but anyway that

537
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:24,490
that is my talk I finished up a little

538
00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:25,900
bit early very nice I always talked

539
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:28,000
faster than I wanted to so thank you so

540
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,700
much and please join us on making the

541
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:33,650
next version of the web
