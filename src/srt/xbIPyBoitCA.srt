1
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:21,630

you

2
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:25,200


3
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:27,310
I'm going to talk to you a little bit

4
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:29,739
about ethics around making software and

5
00:00:29,739 --> 00:00:32,050
not only do I not have any slides

6
00:00:32,050 --> 00:00:33,910
there's also no code and it's not about

7
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:36,670
JavaScript so I'm afraid I'm gonna have

8
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:38,019
to I'm gonna have to disappoint you a

9
00:00:38,019 --> 00:00:41,500
little bit and when I was practicing

10
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,659
this this took me between 20 and 40

11
00:00:43,659 --> 00:00:46,440
minutes so literally anything can happen

12
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:49,570
but I think it's really important to

13
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:53,260
talk about an ethics of our work and and

14
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:54,550
it's not something that gets talked

15
00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:57,070
about a lot and I think the reason for

16
00:00:57,070 --> 00:00:59,140
it is that a lot of people especially

17
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:01,660
who don't necessarily have a technical

18
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:03,969
background tend to think that well you

19
00:01:03,969 --> 00:01:05,860
know computing is this kind of objective

20
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:08,979
for most scientific thing and therefore

21
00:01:08,979 --> 00:01:11,259
by extension these qualities apply also

22
00:01:11,259 --> 00:01:13,300
to all technologies that are being made

23
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:16,869
and what's even worse I think is that

24
00:01:16,869 --> 00:01:19,149
this kind of thinking applies also to

25
00:01:19,149 --> 00:01:20,530
people who make technology so they

26
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:23,259
assumed often to be more logical more

27
00:01:23,259 --> 00:01:25,000
free from human bias and somehow

28
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,909
magically not very human not susceptible

29
00:01:27,909 --> 00:01:30,460
to emotions which is you know

30
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:34,689
and so we tell you about some projects

31
00:01:34,689 --> 00:01:37,689
that I think really get my point across

32
00:01:37,689 --> 00:01:40,259
that technologies and body and

33
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:42,549
communicate the ideas of people who made

34
00:01:42,549 --> 00:01:45,009
them and why I think in sponsor to think

35
00:01:45,009 --> 00:01:46,689
about these things consciously when you

36
00:01:46,689 --> 00:01:48,939
make technology and because these things

37
00:01:48,939 --> 00:01:52,509
really matter so in 2010 while I was

38
00:01:52,509 --> 00:01:55,479
still studying at university I want to

39
00:01:55,479 --> 00:01:57,399
speak to Margot Boden who is a

40
00:01:57,399 --> 00:02:00,460
researcher in the fields of cognitive

41
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:03,030
and computer science psychology

42
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:05,890
artificial intelligence and I went to

43
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:08,829
speak to her about self ethics of

44
00:02:08,829 --> 00:02:12,609
developing human-like robot companions

45
00:02:12,609 --> 00:02:14,260
mainly for applications in serve

46
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:17,230
providing medical care or education and

47
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:19,510
so on and as we were talking about it

48
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:23,290
she told me a story of San George's

49
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:25,570
Hospital st. George's Medical Hospital

50
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:27,700
College in London which is a medical

51
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:30,970
school and which is very popular because

52
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:32,859
it's a very good school and therefore

53
00:02:32,859 --> 00:02:35,260
every year they get quite a lot of

54
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:37,780
applicants so the applicants go through

55
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:38,950
kind of multistage

56
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:41,770
education process offense they're kind

57
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:44,500
of like rated on this of grades and like

58
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:45,879
the classes they took and things like

59
00:02:45,879 --> 00:02:48,970
that and on the basis of diamond people

60
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:51,310
decide whether it's worth to invite such

61
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:54,010
a potential students to an interview and

62
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:55,810
then like once they invited to interview

63
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:58,120
there's like some other stuff that

64
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,500
happens that I'm not really sure about

65
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:03,130
but I'm so they've decided that this

66
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:05,590
first part of a process could be easily

67
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:07,750
automated and it's the part of a process

68
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:09,819
that's really labor-intensive and it

69
00:03:09,819 --> 00:03:12,489
takes a lot of staff time to kind of go

70
00:03:12,489 --> 00:03:14,290
for all the applications and decide who

71
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:18,310
is worthy of interviewing so in 1980s

72
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:20,560
and San George's Medical Hospital

73
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,890
decided to develop a computer program

74
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:25,720
that could deal with their initial stage

75
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:28,000
of the application the application

76
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,370
process and so they've devised a certain

77
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:36,489
rules that were given statistical

78
00:03:36,489 --> 00:03:39,280
statistical waiting and these rules were

79
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,319
to do with like what what grades they

80
00:03:41,319 --> 00:03:43,930
got for which subject and so on and then

81
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:46,750
the students were so marked an order of

82
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:48,280
preference depend on how many points

83
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,900
they scored and then like there was a

84
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:51,910
threshold establish above which they

85
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:54,940
would get invited to an interview so

86
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:56,620
what happens that once they developed a

87
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:58,840
system they started to tweak the

88
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,180
statistical weightings and applying to

89
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:03,940
all the different options and based on

90
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:06,400
previous year's data set like on who

91
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,799
applied and what kind of grades they had

92
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:10,510
and so on and who ended up getting

93
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:13,180
invited then they tweaked the program to

94
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:15,579
basically exactly replicate the results

95
00:04:15,579 --> 00:04:18,930
they got in the previous yes so then

96
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:23,320
between 1982 and 1996 they use the

97
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,870
program to help them in that with the

98
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:29,169
admission system and that carried on

99
00:04:29,169 --> 00:04:32,410
only answer 1996 when two members of

100
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:35,800
staff have complained to commission of

101
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,870
racial equality that the admission

102
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:40,660
system essentially was discriminating

103
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:46,210
against people of color and also that

104
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:48,909
was given not enough prominence to women

105
00:04:48,909 --> 00:04:51,370
and people from poorer backgrounds now

106
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:52,840
the software itself

107
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:55,300
was only performing very simple

108
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:58,180
calculations very simple computations

109
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:01,120
that you know and also as a not a human

110
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,400
agent software itself doesn't have any

111
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,860
prejudices and biases but because it was

112
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:08,199
made by people who had themselves and

113
00:05:08,199 --> 00:05:10,449
examined prejudices they ended up

114
00:05:10,449 --> 00:05:11,979
creating it so that the software

115
00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:14,380
replicated in a seemingly objective

116
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:18,370
manner now it would be very unfair of me

117
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:20,410
to suggest that this was done

118
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:22,990
deliberately because at the time some

119
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:26,139
george's medical school was the most

120
00:05:26,139 --> 00:05:28,600
diverse college in entire England and

121
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:31,389
and therefore I think what happened

122
00:05:31,389 --> 00:05:34,300
there is that people who didn't

123
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:37,030
necessarily think about their own biases

124
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:42,850
ended up replicating them um I think

125
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:44,919
it's also really interesting that in

126
00:05:44,919 --> 00:05:47,770
this case this was only uncovered after

127
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:51,100
a self human was removed from the

128
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:53,110
process so once software took over it

129
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:55,479
was okay for people to complain about

130
00:05:55,479 --> 00:05:58,180
its biases and bring them to light but

131
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:00,039
when it was your colleagues doing it

132
00:06:00,039 --> 00:06:01,690
perhaps it was a little bit more

133
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:05,410
difficult so I think some projects end

134
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:09,550
up some expressing values of people even

135
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:11,200
though people didn't necessarily build

136
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:15,180
them into the projects for example and

137
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:18,099
Google glass is the kind of technology

138
00:06:18,099 --> 00:06:22,630
where a lot of people bring to light the

139
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:24,820
fact that they're kind of scared of the

140
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:26,950
privacy implications of technology like

141
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:30,220
that being widespread and potentially

142
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:32,139
always connected and always recording

143
00:06:32,139 --> 00:06:34,960
and they worry about who is an ownership

144
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,419
of the data that is being captured who

145
00:06:37,419 --> 00:06:40,810
stores it who has access to it and where

146
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:42,789
they as a person featuring in this data

147
00:06:42,789 --> 00:06:44,800
you have any kind of access to it or

148
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,630
whether you even know that this data

149
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:52,450
exists and but I think it's really

150
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:54,700
important to think that the team that

151
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:56,169
has designed it although I don't

152
00:06:56,169 --> 00:06:57,849
actually know because I was in the part

153
00:06:57,849 --> 00:07:00,010
of it and i don't really know anybody at

154
00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:02,530
Google but I assume that when it comes

155
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:04,450
to designing products like that first

156
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:06,249
things that come to mind is you

157
00:07:06,249 --> 00:07:08,949
exploring the impossible the desire to

158
00:07:08,949 --> 00:07:10,979
create something that hasn't been

159
00:07:10,979 --> 00:07:13,509
created before the desire to bring

160
00:07:13,509 --> 00:07:16,479
computing to pass that normally would

161
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,429
require you to switch off and do

162
00:07:18,429 --> 00:07:21,729
something else and focus on a device so

163
00:07:21,729 --> 00:07:23,319
instead you kind of like start

164
00:07:23,319 --> 00:07:25,329
seamlessly integrated into your life and

165
00:07:25,329 --> 00:07:29,559
the privacy implications don't necessary

166
00:07:29,559 --> 00:07:32,199
feature on the list of priorities of a

167
00:07:32,199 --> 00:07:33,849
team that designs a product like that

168
00:07:33,849 --> 00:07:36,879
and it's not necessarily a bad thing and

169
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:42,309
I think it's just a fact that exists

170
00:07:42,309 --> 00:07:45,309
that you have company cultures that have

171
00:07:45,309 --> 00:07:48,129
certain sets of priorities and you have

172
00:07:48,129 --> 00:07:49,599
people working in teams that have

173
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:51,639
certain sets of priorities and these

174
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:54,069
things end up being embedded in the

175
00:07:54,069 --> 00:07:59,799
product that these teams create so

176
00:07:59,799 --> 00:08:07,839
sometimes I disagree with the priorities

177
00:08:07,839 --> 00:08:09,999
of people who make stuff and these

178
00:08:09,999 --> 00:08:12,479
things make me very angry and I

179
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:16,749
sometimes wonder whether the decisions

180
00:08:16,749 --> 00:08:18,639
they make are by design everything

181
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:20,079
whether they are aware of the

182
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:26,619
implications of the things they do so

183
00:08:26,619 --> 00:08:32,550
for example sorry for example there is a

184
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:37,120
new wave of businesses like TaskRabbit

185
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:40,479
or crowdsource or crowd flower which

186
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:42,969
basically operates on the idea that as a

187
00:08:42,969 --> 00:08:45,879
business you often have a lot of tasks

188
00:08:45,879 --> 00:08:48,750
that are fairly small or repetitive or

189
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:50,800
sometimes they're kind of unique and

190
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,230
they're not going to repeat so instead

191
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:55,360
of like employing people to perform

192
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,699
certain tasks it would be better if you

193
00:08:57,699 --> 00:08:59,500
could just like get the stuff done and

194
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:02,230
then get on with your work so these

195
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:04,240
businesses essentially allow you to

196
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,550
Commission specific tasks to be

197
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:09,399
completed and you only pay sir fat ass

198
00:09:09,399 --> 00:09:11,110
or pair time that it takes to complete

199
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:16,209
it and in a way like this enables

200
00:09:16,209 --> 00:09:18,399
certain businesses to exist or to get

201
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:19,910
the work done so it

202
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:23,060
you know provides a booming economy for

203
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:25,100
certain types of businesses but it also

204
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:27,740
means that you're completely bypassing

205
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:30,020
employment laws so you don't have to

206
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:32,660
care about your workers health you don't

207
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:35,120
have to care whether they're insured or

208
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,940
whether they have any pension provision

209
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:39,320
you don't have to care whether they have

210
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,330
a healthy workplace to be working from

211
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:44,060
oh where did they get to do and whether

212
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:46,340
they get to take breaks or eat

213
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:48,350
sufficient amounts of food and so on all

214
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:50,900
you care about is the low price so by

215
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:53,510
building technologies that enable this

216
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:57,590
kind of exchange and you are essentially

217
00:09:57,590 --> 00:10:03,230
potentially changing the the sort of way

218
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:05,930
of work of working for people in the

219
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:10,870
future um you know workers rights and

220
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:13,340
something that is just like an add-on

221
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:15,890
that you can conveniently remove when it

222
00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:18,410
suits you there's something that we have

223
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:20,480
fought for for many years to establish

224
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,640
to make sure that there is actually a

225
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,890
healthy a healthy and productive work

226
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:28,040
for us so in cases of businesses like

227
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,780
that I sometimes wonder you know did

228
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:31,310
people not think about the repercussions

229
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:33,950
of creating these businesses but on the

230
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:36,170
other hand they also mean that other

231
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:38,150
types of businesses can get stuff done

232
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:39,740
and therefore they can exist so it's

233
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:45,230
like a double-edged sword and but there

234
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:49,400
are projects that and very clearly and

235
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:54,950
very deliberately and so communicate the

236
00:10:54,950 --> 00:10:57,350
values of people who have created them

237
00:10:57,350 --> 00:10:59,960
and who work for them one such example

238
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:04,420
that I think is my favorite is Wikipedia

239
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:08,290
no Wikipedia when it was created and

240
00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:11,240
very deliberately it was created based

241
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:13,760
on a set of principles and these

242
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:16,430
principles permeate everything that is

243
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:18,440
to do with the project from software to

244
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:24,050
sort of community guidelines so um there

245
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:25,880
are a few principles that Wikipedia was

246
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:29,210
built upon and indifference of language

247
00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:31,190
communities they're slightly vary in the

248
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:32,690
kind of written down site differently

249
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:33,410
and

250
00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:37,100
the not um not very definitive but the

251
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:40,089
kind of like very general ideas and

252
00:11:40,089 --> 00:11:42,709
English language one english-language

253
00:11:42,709 --> 00:11:45,350
wikipedia defines them as five pillars

254
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:48,560
and these are openness of the community

255
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,389
kindness and respect towards other

256
00:11:50,389 --> 00:11:54,709
people and assertion of freedoms and in

257
00:11:54,709 --> 00:11:56,660
a little bit more detail they speak

258
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:59,899
about in like so first of all they

259
00:11:59,899 --> 00:12:02,540
define that Wikipedia is an encyclopedia

260
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:05,089
and therefore it's not an advertising

261
00:12:05,089 --> 00:12:07,910
platform it's not a directory of

262
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:13,550
information and and it's not a

263
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:15,050
collection of just random information

264
00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:17,060
there has to be a purpose to everything

265
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:23,360
they do and and this kind of idea helps

266
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:26,329
wikipedia maintain a good quality of

267
00:12:26,329 --> 00:12:29,360
content another idea is that it's

268
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,519
written from neutral point of view so

269
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:34,519
your personal opinion is not welcome

270
00:12:34,519 --> 00:12:37,759
you're supposed to characterize facts

271
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:41,420
rather than interpret them and together

272
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:44,269
with the surprise principal and these

273
00:12:44,269 --> 00:12:46,069
two things mean that quality of content

274
00:12:46,069 --> 00:12:48,079
on Wikipedia is generally held up to

275
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:50,680
very high standards then there's a

276
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:54,050
freedom principle which means that not

277
00:12:54,050 --> 00:12:57,439
only is the content free to access you

278
00:12:57,439 --> 00:12:59,660
are also free to contribute so you can

279
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:02,180
freely modify it you can adopt it and

280
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:06,860
you can share it he can edit it and you

281
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:09,759
can use it for any purpose you like and

282
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:12,949
this is like my favorite principle

283
00:13:12,949 --> 00:13:16,480
because essentially and it creates a

284
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:19,819
sort of shine that totally transcends

285
00:13:19,819 --> 00:13:22,160
all human differences so no matter where

286
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,779
you from no matter what is your

287
00:13:23,779 --> 00:13:26,480
background and you can contribute to

288
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,370
this amazing project and the only thing

289
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:30,170
that matters is that you want to do

290
00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:32,829
something and you want to help out and

291
00:13:32,829 --> 00:13:36,529
like one of the key sort of features of

292
00:13:36,529 --> 00:13:38,809
Wikipedia that stems from this principle

293
00:13:38,809 --> 00:13:41,389
is that to ensure that there are no

294
00:13:41,389 --> 00:13:44,420
barriers to entry like you can edit

295
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:47,030
anonymously you can register and

296
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:49,550
a nickname or you can register under

297
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:51,800
your full name but to remove all the

298
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:54,050
barriers like you don't have to register

299
00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:56,450
at all so you just like you can edit it

300
00:13:56,450 --> 00:13:59,090
anonymously which is really important

301
00:13:59,090 --> 00:14:02,600
and penultimate pillar on which

302
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:06,110
Wikipedia is built is following the

303
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:08,870
Wikipedia etiquette which is that

304
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:11,540
personal attacks are not welcome this is

305
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:13,640
not the place to be arguing about stuff

306
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:16,340
this is not a place for personal attacks

307
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:18,440
this is the place we report like the

308
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,360
highest of social standards so that we

309
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,860
can collaborate on something that's

310
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:24,860
really important and this is also

311
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:29,060
important to the previous principle the

312
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:31,280
principle of freedom because if you have

313
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:33,020
a situation where you have to fight

314
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:35,690
people on a personal level to contribute

315
00:14:35,690 --> 00:14:37,040
to the project that means you can't

316
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,720
contribute to the project so this is

317
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,760
removing and another barrier to entry

318
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:43,970
and the last one is that there are no

319
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:47,810
firm rules and therefore you can't make

320
00:14:47,810 --> 00:14:50,210
your own decisions and you can take

321
00:14:50,210 --> 00:14:51,860
responsibility for the things you do in

322
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:53,840
Wikipedia and if they are wrong then

323
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,580
community will work it out and tell you

324
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:58,520
but essentially you're given the freedom

325
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:00,590
to kind of owned part of the project and

326
00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:04,430
make almost executive decisions so from

327
00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:07,010
the very beginning the set of values for

328
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:08,780
shapes like the feature set of the

329
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:11,060
software that exists but not only it

330
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:12,710
also shapes how the community guidelines

331
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:15,080
are constructed and how the community

332
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:18,860
around wikipedias run and it's a success

333
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:21,110
story in many ways it's the largest

334
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:22,820
reference like one of the largest

335
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:26,930
reference websites and and the amount of

336
00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:28,760
contribution it receives is absolutely

337
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:31,730
enormous and it's it's a limit the

338
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:35,600
contributions are on a very broad range

339
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,820
of subjects as well unlike printed

340
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:40,160
encyclopedias and the longer the

341
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,740
articles exist and the longer they're

342
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:44,720
being talked about and they're more

343
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:48,230
consensus is achieved on a lot of issues

344
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:50,960
and the more people contribute so you

345
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,520
end up with articles that are very

346
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:55,520
comprehensive and usually very factually

347
00:15:55,520 --> 00:16:00,740
accurate so these ideals of like freedom

348
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:03,440
and openness are the ones that I

349
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,970
personally very very deeply and this

350
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:09,470
amazing idea that you know you can

351
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:11,330
contribute whoever you are and your

352
00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:13,520
contributions only matter based on their

353
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:16,880
own merit is super powerful but when

354
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:20,300
people talk about meritocracy and they

355
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:22,010
imagine that simply by virtue of

356
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:25,399
removing barriers to entry and allowing

357
00:16:25,399 --> 00:16:28,399
everybody to contribute in a in a good

358
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:31,370
environment then the contributions will

359
00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:34,010
accurately reflect society and will

360
00:16:34,010 --> 00:16:35,870
provide equal opportunities to

361
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:39,620
contribute but despite being called the

362
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:42,470
sum of all human knowledge Wikipedia is

363
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:44,600
only the sum of knowledge of people who

364
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:47,300
are already online and who have time and

365
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:50,600
ability to contribute despite the best

366
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,790
intentions only nine percent of

367
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:57,730
contributors identify as female and and

368
00:16:57,730 --> 00:17:00,020
Wikipedia recognizes that this is

369
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:02,839
something that needs a lot of work now

370
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:05,270
what's really cool about it is that they

371
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:07,010
recognize that the problem is no longer

372
00:17:07,010 --> 00:17:08,720
technical because the barriers have been

373
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,870
removed but they recognize this is a

374
00:17:11,870 --> 00:17:13,339
social program and therefore they've

375
00:17:13,339 --> 00:17:15,290
devised social ways of dealing with it

376
00:17:15,290 --> 00:17:19,059
so for example and they appoint and

377
00:17:19,059 --> 00:17:21,679
university ambassadors who sort of

378
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:23,480
evangelize about Wikipedia and try to

379
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:29,020
broaden their kind of like Britain the I

380
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:31,700
try to get contributions from serve

381
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:34,160
broader demographic done already exist

382
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:40,400
and and but even that doesn't address

383
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,860
the fact that only a third of the global

384
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:47,090
population is online so despite various

385
00:17:47,090 --> 00:17:49,840
attempts until we fix infrastructure and

386
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:52,700
we can't imagine that there's going to

387
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:55,880
be an equality of participation

388
00:17:55,880 --> 00:18:01,940
opportunity now I've been trained as a

389
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:03,920
designer I started design on university

390
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:07,550
not computer science and as a designer

391
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:10,070
you kind of learn to think that when

392
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:12,500
you're assessing whether a project is

393
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,570
successful

394
00:18:14,570 --> 00:18:16,580
you have to remember that every single

395
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:19,370
design and is always being used in a

396
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:23,570
specific context so you have your object

397
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:26,419
whatever it might be and and it's used

398
00:18:26,419 --> 00:18:29,210
in a specific physical place by a

399
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:31,669
specific person and the person and

400
00:18:31,669 --> 00:18:34,090
displays are always under various

401
00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:37,750
influences beat political financial

402
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:40,840
cultural environmental technical and

403
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:43,370
these may or may not differ from the

404
00:18:43,370 --> 00:18:45,230
context under which you are creating

405
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:48,110
this stuff and the design that doesn't

406
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:50,570
take these contacts into account and

407
00:18:50,570 --> 00:18:52,970
doesn't respond to them is essentially a

408
00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:54,980
failed design because nothing can exist

409
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:57,740
in the vacuum expecting something to

410
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:59,690
exist in a perfect world is essentially

411
00:18:59,690 --> 00:19:02,990
just rejecting reality so I've been

412
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:05,330
thinking about this in relation to

413
00:19:05,330 --> 00:19:08,990
Wikipedia and I wonder whether the lofty

414
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:12,169
ideals baked right into it and somehow

415
00:19:12,169 --> 00:19:14,059
make for a failed design because it

416
00:19:14,059 --> 00:19:17,659
fails to sort of respond to a world in

417
00:19:17,659 --> 00:19:18,980
which not everybody can actually

418
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:21,320
contribute and freedom to share

419
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:23,539
information isn't just dictated by you

420
00:19:23,539 --> 00:19:25,340
know your ability to make it so that

421
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:27,519
everybody can edit it but also by

422
00:19:27,519 --> 00:19:29,360
circumstances beyond potential

423
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:33,470
contributors control but technology is a

424
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:35,929
cultural product and as such not only

425
00:19:35,929 --> 00:19:37,669
does it reflect the culture that was

426
00:19:37,669 --> 00:19:39,980
created in but actually actively shapes

427
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:43,399
the culture of the future so not only

428
00:19:43,399 --> 00:19:45,860
does it embody values of the people who

429
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:48,620
made it but also somehow expresses the

430
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:50,659
virus back into the world and kind of

431
00:19:50,659 --> 00:19:52,820
creates the world in which these values

432
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:55,220
become pervasive so it can be a

433
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:56,840
transformative tool because it

434
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:58,639
communicates something about what we

435
00:19:58,639 --> 00:20:02,659
want the world to be cliff who proposed

436
00:20:02,659 --> 00:20:05,120
developing software engineer a code of

437
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:08,659
ethics said this software is a form of

438
00:20:08,659 --> 00:20:10,429
expression and can contain both

439
00:20:10,429 --> 00:20:12,860
entertainment and commentary on society

440
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:16,429
politics and economics so to me the more

441
00:20:16,429 --> 00:20:18,289
I think about it the more Wikipedia

442
00:20:18,289 --> 00:20:20,600
seems this kind of a expect expressive

443
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:23,059
speculative project a communicates the

444
00:20:23,059 --> 00:20:24,649
idea that we want to live in a world

445
00:20:24,649 --> 00:20:26,629
where everybody can contribute and we

446
00:20:26,629 --> 00:20:28,090
all see value in

447
00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:29,740
doing something together and doing

448
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:31,120
something of great importance that we

449
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:37,090
can then all share and use but there are

450
00:20:37,090 --> 00:20:40,299
many projects that don't necessarily

451
00:20:40,299 --> 00:20:41,950
receive this kind of careful

452
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:44,320
consideration when they're being created

453
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,809
like Wikipedia did so when I spoke to my

454
00:20:46,809 --> 00:20:49,000
great bowden I asked what she thought

455
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,870
about why that was and she said that you

456
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:55,630
know many people making software I still

457
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:57,490
very young so they don't really think

458
00:20:57,490 --> 00:20:59,529
about consequences of their own actions

459
00:20:59,529 --> 00:21:02,649
and perhaps you know they haven't yet

460
00:21:02,649 --> 00:21:04,659
experienced a lot of the world so maybe

461
00:21:04,659 --> 00:21:06,029
they haven't made me exposed to

462
00:21:06,029 --> 00:21:10,330
diversity or old age and you know they

463
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:13,690
haven't they have no way of kind of

464
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:16,630
relating to their own life and with

465
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:18,760
these things because they just haven't

466
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,559
had the chance to like experience so

467
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:24,190
much of the world yet and also you know

468
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:25,510
they're dealing with machines so they

469
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:28,720
often kind of excused for antisocial

470
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,270
behavior and not being interested in

471
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:33,190
other people because they would rather

472
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:38,919
sit and program all day also another

473
00:21:38,919 --> 00:21:40,390
interesting thing she said was that

474
00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:42,610
instead of being excited about the

475
00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:44,830
culture and social problems we face the

476
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:46,330
actual real problems in the world that

477
00:21:46,330 --> 00:21:48,250
we could be solving people often just

478
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:49,270
get excited about the technical

479
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:51,390
challenges as if they're kind of

480
00:21:51,390 --> 00:21:53,950
replacement for dealing with the actual

481
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:55,840
problems that we should be solving as a

482
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:59,200
society now designers and civil

483
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,870
engineers get taught ethics and to

484
00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:04,360
prepare them for real life work

485
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:06,940
experience and they get taught at

486
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:09,370
University but despite the incredible

487
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:11,710
power of software engineering and how it

488
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:13,299
affects the world and how it shapes it

489
00:22:13,299 --> 00:22:15,149
like that isn't necessarily the case

490
00:22:15,149 --> 00:22:18,010
also if it were the case like a lot of

491
00:22:18,010 --> 00:22:19,779
us are entirely self-taught so that

492
00:22:19,779 --> 00:22:21,070
wouldn't necessarily make a big

493
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:25,539
difference so I would like you to think

494
00:22:25,539 --> 00:22:27,669
about like everyday decisions you make

495
00:22:27,669 --> 00:22:29,440
when you're creating stuff you know and

496
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,390
like some of these decisions might be

497
00:22:31,390 --> 00:22:34,000
absolutely huge and painful and legally

498
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,929
risky like ladar Levison who was built

499
00:22:37,929 --> 00:22:39,970
in love a bit and hosting him for 10

500
00:22:39,970 --> 00:22:40,800
years

501
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:44,010
email system that Edwards Norman Snowden

502
00:22:44,010 --> 00:22:47,670
reportedly used and when faced with the

503
00:22:47,670 --> 00:22:49,380
potential of having to reveal some of

504
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:51,900
his customers data to national security

505
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:54,330
agency decided to shut down the whole

506
00:22:54,330 --> 00:22:58,230
system now most of us are interfaced

507
00:22:58,230 --> 00:23:00,060
with ethical challenges of that

508
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:02,880
magnitude but even like small things we

509
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,590
deal with every day can have like a

510
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:09,540
massive impact on people's lives for

511
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:11,730
example you know every day I make

512
00:23:11,730 --> 00:23:13,470
decisions about like what kind of data

513
00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:15,630
do we collect about our customers well

514
00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:18,330
how is it story who has access to you

515
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:19,740
know do we collect more than necessary

516
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:22,830
who do we share it with and so on but it

517
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:24,900
isn't just about storage and collection

518
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:31,200
of data and for example of my work we

519
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,550
built a lot of different digital

520
00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:34,710
products and in every single one of them

521
00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:36,720
we've got a people tie table in the

522
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,610
database instead of very usual users

523
00:23:38,610 --> 00:23:41,550
table because we thought that it would

524
00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:43,470
make us talk about people differently

525
00:23:43,470 --> 00:23:47,250
and and it did it's slightly less

526
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:48,960
dehumanizing to think of people as

527
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:51,840
individuals than it is about a group of

528
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:57,350
users so I think my last point is that

529
00:23:57,350 --> 00:23:59,790
technology is made by people and it's

530
00:23:59,790 --> 00:24:02,250
used by people and therefore it's a

531
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:04,470
social and cultural thing you can

532
00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:07,290
somehow remove magically people from the

533
00:24:07,290 --> 00:24:09,030
equation so you can't get technology

534
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:10,980
that's somehow objective and doesn't

535
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:13,140
express human values and you can't

536
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:15,270
design it and make it in a vacuum where

537
00:24:15,270 --> 00:24:16,680
you don't understand how people use it

538
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:21,210
and what they want from it and you are

539
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:22,800
building tools of the future you are

540
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,540
building the things that are shaping how

541
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:26,100
we are going to be thinking about the

542
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:28,380
world in years to come and the things

543
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:30,990
that you make might enable people to for

544
00:24:30,990 --> 00:24:32,820
example communicate or to express

545
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:34,830
themselves to do all the things they

546
00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:36,500
might need to get on with their lives

547
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:38,940
technology now mediates pretty much

548
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:41,070
every sphere of our lives it's in the

549
00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:42,780
banking system it's in a healthcare

550
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:45,390
provision and enables law enforcement

551
00:24:45,390 --> 00:24:49,680
and justice system and it mediates our

552
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:51,720
personal communications will be it

553
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:54,500
personal or

554
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:57,320
professional or intimate and it's a part

555
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,340
of our culture and it helps us create us

556
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:04,970
so essentially technology is like one of

557
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:07,640
those things that lets people and lack

558
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,890
the human rights and if it sounds like

559
00:25:09,890 --> 00:25:11,960
it's a massive responsibility that's

560
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:15,980
because it is so I would like you to

561
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:18,050
basically take that responsibility and

562
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:20,360
like our political leanings may vary and

563
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:22,070
we might disagree with me on a lot of

564
00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:26,030
points but I think I would be successful

565
00:25:26,030 --> 00:25:29,180
if you just think about it and know what

566
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:30,830
it is that you want the world to be and

567
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:33,200
you are prepared to stand take a stand

568
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,670
and make decisions that you could be

569
00:25:34,670 --> 00:25:36,830
proud of because making the world a

570
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:51,700
better place it is your job thank you
