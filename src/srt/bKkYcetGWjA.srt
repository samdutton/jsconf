00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,810

oh my name is Amanda glosson and I've

2
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:06,810
been pushing pixels around screens for

3
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:10,620
over 10 years now mostly what I mean

4
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:12,900
when I say that is I've been writing

5
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:15,750
software for a while but I've also

6
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:18,600
worked on my fair share of design

7
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:22,170
projects along the way recently I found

8
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:24,539
my way into pixel art which is actually

9
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:26,670
how I ended up here in front of all of

10
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:29,970
you today talking about thinking inside

11
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:37,860
the box thinking inside the box white

12
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:41,640
box am I talking about what's in the box

13
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:50,100
I should I go back the box i'm talking

14
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:52,590
about is one that is bounded by

15
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:55,590
constraints constraints are just defined

16
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:58,500
as limitations or restrictions imposed

17
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:01,410
on your project and the space inside

18
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:04,680
that is our problem space that's the bit

19
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:07,229
where we get to work and solve a bunch

20
00:01:07,229 --> 00:01:10,140
of problems in the case of my pixel art

21
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:12,950
my constraints are very straightforward

22
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:15,180
pixels can either be filtered

23
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:18,540
transparent my canvas is eight pixels

24
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:23,040
wide by 16 pixels tall and recently I've

25
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,930
started to limit myself to the NES

26
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:29,750
palette javi very nice and neat looking

27
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:33,350
128 pixel canvas for my problem space

28
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:36,530
this isn't an awful lot of work with

29
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:39,990
when I first started out nearly every

30
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:42,979
sprite I drew felt impossible at first

31
00:01:42,979 --> 00:01:46,200
how am I going to draw a drum set this

32
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:49,380
is not the right form factor it's not

33
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:56,009
even going to fit tires are round they

34
00:01:56,009 --> 00:02:01,549
are not rectangular dinosaurs are really

35
00:02:01,549 --> 00:02:05,640
really big

36
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:09,310
I usually only work on pixel art during

37
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:13,030
my train commute and as time went on I

38
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:14,410
began to notice that I was drawing

39
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:17,980
faster instead of only drawing one a day

40
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:19,990
starting it on the way to work and

41
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:24,040
finishing it up on the way home I was

42
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:28,830
making two a day so I made three a day

43
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:33,100
and then I was making for in I was

44
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:37,270
finding that I was more quickly finding

45
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:39,610
creative solutions inside of my problem

46
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:43,330
space and I started to suspect that my

47
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:47,350
familiarity with my constraint set was

48
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:50,709
helping me get better at this but I

49
00:02:50,709 --> 00:02:53,020
wasn't really sure because there aren't

50
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:54,760
a lot of people out there who are like

51
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:57,520
yeah constrain yourself dream really

52
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:04,810
small right no one says that ever so as

53
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:06,670
soon as I started considering these

54
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:09,190
constraints I was immediately reminded

55
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:11,950
of a presentation I attended at this

56
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:15,040
year's California extreme about the

57
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:20,530
arcade game defender so this is an

58
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:24,120
arcade game that was developed in 1981

59
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:28,180
that was a long time ago it's a 2d side

60
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:30,340
scroller where the player flies the

61
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:32,739
starship around this alien terrain and

62
00:03:32,739 --> 00:03:35,230
you're trying to protect these

63
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:39,519
astronauts from some aliens the talk at

64
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:41,739
California extreme was given by two

65
00:03:41,739 --> 00:03:44,320
defenders developers Eugene Jarvis and

66
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,750
Sam dicker they were there to talk about

67
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:49,180
the constraints that they faced and

68
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:51,370
their design process when working on the

69
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:54,549
game when they started development they

70
00:03:54,549 --> 00:03:58,420
had never designed a video game and they

71
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:00,430
didn't know anything about hardware so

72
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:02,769
they were like well let's get the best

73
00:04:02,769 --> 00:04:06,549
cpu available now again this is 1981 so

74
00:04:06,549 --> 00:04:09,750
what they got was a one megahertz

75
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:15,459
motorola 8609 with an 8-bit processor it

76
00:04:15,459 --> 00:04:19,269
had some 16-bit operations they

77
00:04:19,269 --> 00:04:25,080
12 kilobytes of ROM 48 kilobytes of DRAM

78
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:30,069
single frame buffer and 16 colors this

79
00:04:30,069 --> 00:04:33,220
was actually pretty good at the time but

80
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:34,900
they were so really constrained by their

81
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:38,770
hardware and these constraints inform

82
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:40,569
the design throughout the development of

83
00:04:40,569 --> 00:04:45,759
the game so for example Eugene Jarvis

84
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:48,430
chose to set the game in space because

85
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:50,530
he thought the abstract setting would

86
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:52,770
help to obscure their simple graphics

87
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:56,800
the landscape see at the bottom is only

88
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,389
a pixel wide and that's mostly because

89
00:04:58,389 --> 00:05:00,460
the hardware wasn't powerful enough to

90
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:04,180
generate anything more detail again

91
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:07,860
instead of creating assets in the game

92
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:12,460
CM dicker wrote some particle effects to

93
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:16,000
generate unique explosions so that was

94
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,159
pretty cool powerful software at the

95
00:05:18,159 --> 00:05:21,819
time because these hardware limitations

96
00:05:21,819 --> 00:05:23,349
cause their graphics to be somewhat

97
00:05:23,349 --> 00:05:25,150
simplistic they had to focus on their

98
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:28,060
gameplay to make a good game no no one

99
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:29,289
was going to look at this and be like oh

100
00:05:29,289 --> 00:05:32,680
wow incredible even though they did have

101
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,449
16 colors which was kind of a big deal

102
00:05:34,449 --> 00:05:37,870
of the time so they created a bunch of

103
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:40,180
characters and projectiles and each sort

104
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:43,210
of had its own personality the

105
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:45,759
personality emerged from some simple

106
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:48,009
rules based AI that they've developed

107
00:05:48,009 --> 00:05:50,770
and when they're on the screen together

108
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:53,590
you ended up with a sort of notoriously

109
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:58,539
punishing ecosystem so this team of guys

110
00:05:58,539 --> 00:06:01,900
with limited hardware limited hardware

111
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:05,800
knowledge developed a game which since

112
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,990
its release has become one of the

113
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:12,969
highest grossing arcade games ever so

114
00:06:12,969 --> 00:06:14,590
they get to the end of this talk and I'm

115
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:19,150
like these guys are wizards like do

116
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:21,069
people even write software like this

117
00:06:21,069 --> 00:06:23,500
anymore like I'm at work complaining

118
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:26,229
that I have to support ie7 like I having

119
00:06:26,229 --> 00:06:30,339
I have incredible resource to be honest

120
00:06:30,339 --> 00:06:33,070
at first I sort of dismissed this story

121
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:35,800
even being about the constraints I sort

122
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:41,010
of attributed their successes to be more

123
00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:44,110
based on their programming genius so I

124
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:47,530
kept digging for other examples so I

125
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:50,980
started thinking about we're now so to

126
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:54,430
create his parent ease jiri uses the

127
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:58,030
existing melody rhythm intonation and

128
00:06:58,030 --> 00:07:00,730
rhyme scheme of the original song and

129
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:03,010
uses new subject matter to illustrate a

130
00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:05,650
completely different message these are

131
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:07,360
pretty intense constraints when you talk

132
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:12,370
about a song that's nearly everything so

133
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:15,610
in the case of eat it he removed one

134
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:19,270
letter of Michael Jackson's beat it to

135
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:21,160
transition a song about walking away

136
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:23,170
from violence into being one that mocks

137
00:07:23,170 --> 00:07:27,340
the idea that eating food keeps it from

138
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:30,670
being wasted so his entire career has

139
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:34,390
been exploring this framework of musical

140
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:37,210
constraints and certainly he's created

141
00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:39,220
on an original content but he's most

142
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:42,220
known for his parodies so okay maybe

143
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:44,650
weird owl is also a genius he's a

144
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:48,220
musical genius so I kept looking so in

145
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:53,980
nineteen sixty 54 years ago bennett cerf

146
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:57,970
that co guys all fifty dollars that he

147
00:07:57,970 --> 00:07:59,200
wouldn't be able to write an

148
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,510
entertaining children's book with only

149
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:05,560
50 unique words you might know Theo

150
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:08,410
gazelle better by a pseudonym of dr.

151
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:13,330
Seuss dr. Seuss won that bet with his

152
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:17,230
story green eggs and ham since the

153
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:19,060
publication of green eggs and ham it

154
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:23,470
sold more than 200 million copies which

155
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:25,990
makes it the most popular of his works

156
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:28,660
and it's one of the best-selling

157
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:32,349
children's books in history so here's a

158
00:08:32,349 --> 00:08:35,020
list of the 50 words that were used

159
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:38,830
that's all of them you too can go home

160
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:42,400
and make green eggs and ham so at this

161
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:45,100
point I now know that defender eat it

162
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:46,750
green eggs and ham

163
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:48,250
we're all created under heavy

164
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:51,760
constraints I think okay so there's

165
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,290
clearly some relationship between

166
00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:57,910
constraints and ideas we've already

167
00:08:57,910 --> 00:09:00,280
defined constraints as being limits or

168
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:03,220
restrictions so let's also define when

169
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:07,270
an idea is for the sake of this

170
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:10,660
exploration I want to define an idea as

171
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:13,090
being a connection between two pieces of

172
00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:16,570
knowledge that you have in your brain so

173
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:19,000
you have piece of knowledge a piece of

174
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,270
knowledge be and the link between them

175
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:27,610
is an idea a B if we follow along with

176
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:30,820
this pretty simplistic definition of an

177
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:34,030
idea then looking for ideas is really

178
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:37,240
reduced to being a search problem that's

179
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,980
pretty cool so we know how to do thats

180
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:43,450
right some pseudocode so for every node

181
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:46,600
in your knowledge compare it to every

182
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:49,510
other node let's make a link and just

183
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:52,060
for complete list completeness let's

184
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:55,600
make sure it's not the same one and we

185
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,230
have idea ap so the efficiency of the

186
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:02,050
search is defined by the set of

187
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:04,650
knowledge that we're talking about and

188
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:07,570
if you're interested in Big O notation

189
00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:09,880
you already know what the complexity of

190
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:12,370
this is but I put it on a slide so you

191
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:16,839
can take a look at it so by using this

192
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:19,480
simple definition of an idea we're able

193
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:21,250
to see that perhaps adding constraints

194
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:23,320
to limit the set of knowledge that you

195
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:26,140
have to search over for ideas could be

196
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:28,930
of a benefit simply from an efficiency

197
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:33,280
standpoint so we certainly don't want

198
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:37,540
all of the ideas and we shouldn't be

199
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:39,610
satisfied with just having relevant

200
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:43,510
ideas what we really want are the good

201
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:48,370
ideas actually scratch that we want the

202
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:51,370
creative ideas so what's your creative

203
00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:56,020
idea a creative idea is a new idea that

204
00:10:56,020 --> 00:11:00,160
is also useful generative or influential

205
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:03,080
useful meaning it's a new idea that

206
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:05,990
solves some sort of problem generative

207
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:08,150
meaning it's a new idea that leads to

208
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:10,400
other ideas so if you think about our

209
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,980
loop before maybe you make a B and you

210
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:14,360
throw it back in your set of knowledge

211
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:16,930
that it gets very messy and complicated

212
00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:21,110
or it's influential meeting it's a new

213
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:24,970
idea that changes the way people think

214
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:28,760
so how do we choose our constraints how

215
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:30,560
do we do this in such a way that we are

216
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:33,080
able to narrow down our search to be

217
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:35,630
able to create these to find these

218
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:38,540
creative ideas from our previous

219
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:41,540
examples you might think oh gosh maybe

220
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:44,270
we should just add a bunch of random

221
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:46,400
constraints and see what happens but

222
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,890
that's actually probably not what you

223
00:11:48,890 --> 00:11:51,680
want to do so let's take a look at a

224
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:54,590
paint-by-number to paint by number

225
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:57,380
Hamburg the problems faced with a

226
00:11:57,380 --> 00:11:59,450
paint-by-number is totally filled with

227
00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:02,750
constraints 100% the starting place is

228
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:04,460
the burger with a bunch of numbers in it

229
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:08,270
I fill in spaces spaces labeled one with

230
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:11,450
the paint that's labeled 1am and I do

231
00:12:11,450 --> 00:12:14,120
the same for two and I do this until all

232
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:19,190
of the areas fill so if you and I both

233
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:21,860
do the same paint by number and we

234
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:24,590
follow the rules because we're rule

235
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:27,380
followers our pieces would come out

236
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:31,670
looking the same a coloring book page is

237
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:34,040
only a slight step up there's still not

238
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:36,580
an awful lot of room for creativity here

239
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:39,200
especially because this is horse

240
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:43,370
skeleton there are constraints that do

241
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:45,830
not promote creativity but instead

242
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:50,660
promote conformity so we need to ensure

243
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:53,000
that our problem space is actually not

244
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,820
well defined there needs to be some room

245
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:58,310
for the unknown and we also want to

246
00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:00,770
choose these constraints strategically

247
00:13:00,770 --> 00:13:05,510
if chosen correctly a constraint can

248
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:08,000
push you towards the goal that's paired

249
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,110
with it for example you want to promote

250
00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:13,740
the expansion of real

251
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:17,550
xicon write poetry where every syllable

252
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:19,410
is going to count you have to pick the

253
00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:22,590
right words you want to promote

254
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:26,010
cross-browser compatibility don't use

255
00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:28,380
browser prefixes don't use bleeding edge

256
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:34,590
features or maybe only use ie8 promote

257
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:36,810
contrasts you can maybe only use black

258
00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:43,260
and white for your slides so there's

259
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:47,250
also more common constraints that we're

260
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:48,420
going to find that we're not going to be

261
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:50,640
able to do a lot about for example we

262
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:53,250
need to make our clients happy we needed

263
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:57,810
to have it done yesterday regardless of

264
00:13:57,810 --> 00:13:59,760
what sets of constraints you end up

265
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:03,120
stacking up they're going to create a

266
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,130
problem space for you to move around in

267
00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:08,400
and it's probably it's probably not

268
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:11,420
going to look as nice and neat as this

269
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:14,880
it's going to be more messy it's going

270
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:18,750
to look maybe more like this your

271
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:21,780
constraints are going to overlap you're

272
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:23,610
going to create some weird spaces a

273
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:25,830
weird framework for you to work inside

274
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:28,920
of maybe after a while that space

275
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:31,650
becomes something that you fully grok a

276
00:14:31,650 --> 00:14:33,690
space that you can quickly move around

277
00:14:33,690 --> 00:14:35,520
and because you know where all of the

278
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:38,280
boundaries and barriers are in a space

279
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:39,870
where you start making your way into the

280
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:43,590
smaller nukes when you get wedged up

281
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:45,390
into one of those you're going to be

282
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:47,310
coming up with ideas that are generative

283
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:49,530
you're going to be looping them back in

284
00:14:49,530 --> 00:14:50,640
your for loop that we talked about

285
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,650
earlier you're going to be creating new

286
00:14:52,650 --> 00:14:55,050
ideas with them you're going to be

287
00:14:55,050 --> 00:14:56,910
informative other folks that you work

288
00:14:56,910 --> 00:14:59,520
with are going to pick up your ideas and

289
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:01,350
it's going to change their mind and

290
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:02,880
they're going to have new ideas with

291
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,730
those and ultimately these ideas are

292
00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:07,560
going to be useful you're going to be

293
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:10,110
solving problems with them you're going

294
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:14,940
to be turning on creative ideas maybe

295
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:17,880
you begin to identify common constraint

296
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:20,220
frameworks in your work and they become

297
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:23,690
familiar and supportive is old friends

298
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:26,130
even if you don't become best friends

299
00:15:26,130 --> 00:15:27,240
with your constraint

300
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:29,070
I hope that you'll take away some of

301
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:30,680
these ideas to help you identify

302
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:33,120
appreciate and use your constraints to

303
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,490
your advantage in discovering creative

304
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:37,500
solutions in the projects that you're

305
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:41,010
working on you can feel free to find me

306
00:15:41,010 --> 00:15:42,420
on twitter if you want to talk about

307
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:45,420
constraints but just be sure to keep it
