00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:12,959

good morning everyone let's start

2
00:00:12,959 --> 00:00:17,150
talking about es6 the next version of

3
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:20,369
JavaScript and this is will be our

4
00:00:20,369 --> 00:00:22,410
agenda today we will talk about some

5
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:25,980
basics and some of the main features how

6
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:29,099
to use in it today and talk about the

7
00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:31,949
es6 rock project and they're not talking

8
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:34,890
about history because doesn't make any

9
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:39,330
sense today so actually the es6 spec is

10
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:43,649
about 700 pates so we don't have this

11
00:00:43,649 --> 00:00:46,950
time so we have a lot of features and

12
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:51,079
try to cover some of the main features

13
00:00:51,079 --> 00:00:54,289
before i start i am from Brazil and

14
00:00:54,289 --> 00:00:57,719
Brazil is well now for the carnival

15
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:00,449
everyone knows we talk about Brazil we

16
00:01:00,449 --> 00:01:02,879
think in carnival or you think about

17
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:06,240
football yeah it's a great joke thanks

18
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:10,810
for the both

19
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:16,860
I think Brazil is still being recognized

20
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:23,160
as the count of football I think so we

21
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:26,550
have this football in carnival but what

22
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:29,250
I want you to talk it we have a good

23
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:38,250
stuff in Brazil so I think you know

24
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:41,670
Sepultura Sepultura is one of the

25
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:44,130
greatest metal bands in the world and

26
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:46,770
I'm really proud that they are from

27
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:51,240
Brazil so we have this way we have great

28
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:54,150
stuff in Brazil if I have just Samba and

29
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:59,640
bossa nova we have great music so but we

30
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:03,120
also the country of our JavaScript here

31
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:07,530
is the conference we have per year in

32
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:10,790
Brazil we have almost 30 conference

33
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:13,170
JavaScript conference and front-end

34
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:15,239
technology conference and our company

35
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:20,610
community is pretty huge so let's talk

36
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:25,360
with let's start with the basics and

37
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:31,140
here's a funny thing in engineer 6 we

38
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:35,820
have this string that contains but this

39
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:38,970
week the spec change it so it doesn't

40
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:42,180
have any more distinct that contains now

41
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:47,520
the name is includes but why it's

42
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:50,880
because a string that contains will

43
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:53,489
break the web we think that contains not

44
00:02:53,489 --> 00:02:58,019
web compatible because the community

45
00:02:58,019 --> 00:03:02,130
figure out that mootools the popular

46
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:06,000
framework earlier popper framework have

47
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,760
this this method string that contains so

48
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,830
if we put a string that contains

49
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:14,040
natively in JavaScript will break a lot

50
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:18,269
of websites and so the specs change in

51
00:03:18,269 --> 00:03:22,160
this a good thing because the tc39

52
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,890
the guys that are running the

53
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:26,780
specification are looking to the

54
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:28,880
community and looking to the problems

55
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:32,720
and now I have this now the method is

56
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:36,380
this string dot includes and we have

57
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:39,230
also string that starts with and swing

58
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:43,420
dots and we've there's new methods and

59
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:45,920
these three methods takes two arguments

60
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,950
it's a piece of string and we can

61
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:52,790
specify where you want to to start to a

62
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:56,090
JavaScript search so it's pretty basic

63
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:59,690
and we have string that repeat that is

64
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:02,810
pretty common in other language we just

65
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:04,910
specify how many times you want to

66
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:15,230
repeat the string keeping in context of

67
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:19,070
strings we have these templates drinks

68
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:21,560
now in JavaScript template strings are

69
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:25,550
string literals that allows embed

70
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:28,040
expressions and temperate strings

71
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:32,000
introduce these by this backtick grave

72
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,350
accent so we have now the single quote

73
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:40,180
double quote quote and this backtick and

74
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:44,020
here the the first example we have the

75
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:47,890
this just log in a temporary string

76
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:52,640
nothing different here and now we have

77
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:57,020
this mood line string until is e es5 we

78
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:59,390
are not allowed to do this so now with

79
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:01,100
templates week we can break the line and

80
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:03,669
we can have multi swings adults

81
00:05:03,669 --> 00:05:08,600
concatenating and escaping and we can

82
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:12,380
actually do something more useful we can

83
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:15,169
construct a done query so we can use

84
00:05:15,169 --> 00:05:18,230
this place holders inside of templates

85
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:21,560
drinks with the curly brackets and in

86
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,660
this example we are just defined some

87
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:26,750
variables the name and time and inside

88
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:29,419
of our 10 pallets drinks we can just use

89
00:05:29,419 --> 00:05:31,880
it with the placeholders we don't need

90
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:34,160
to concatenate and we don't need an

91
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,780
extra library

92
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:40,090
to do such a thing we had another thing

93
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:42,860
integrating that is tagged at template

94
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:45,500
shrinks we can tag a template string

95
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:48,139
with a function and when we define this

96
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:51,080
function we takes to two arguments the

97
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:53,810
strings inside of templates drinks and

98
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:57,919
the valleys and then this not useful

99
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:01,100
example is I'm just looping through the

100
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:04,300
strings and then returning uppercase and

101
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:07,130
here's how to use it I'm just define

102
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:09,500
some variables and then I tag the

103
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,919
template string and now we have a

104
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:14,600
argentina and spanish argentinian

105
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:18,650
message no actually here is in in

106
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:20,870
english the next one is in Argentina

107
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:24,520
because with templates wings we can do

108
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:28,970
something like I etienne implementation

109
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:32,960
just define a current language and then

110
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,830
I i define the strings of my application

111
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:39,500
here I'm define the English message and

112
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:43,729
the Spanish Argentinian message and then

113
00:06:43,729 --> 00:06:47,930
the implementation is pretty simple I'm

114
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:53,090
offline ok the difference here and look

115
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:55,010
to the strings and then we just pointing

116
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:57,410
to the object literal with the specific

117
00:06:57,410 --> 00:07:01,580
language and this is how to use it I

118
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:05,330
have some variables and then I tag the

119
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:09,020
templates drink and bond we have now the

120
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:12,110
message in Spanish so you can you can

121
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:14,390
imagine a lot of things you can do with

122
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:16,280
templates ring this is a pretty pretty

123
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:24,320
simple example with I eating in moving

124
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:28,490
through four strings to numbers we have

125
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:31,250
a lot of things in numbers now in at six

126
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:35,419
one of the thing fun thing is we have

127
00:07:35,419 --> 00:07:38,210
octo in binary literals so now you can

128
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:42,320
explicitly specify if you this number is

129
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:46,280
octo or if is binary this is pretty

130
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,520
useful

131
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,490
and we have this true matters is

132
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:53,639
finished and is not a number i think is

133
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:56,789
as well know the is not a number is well

134
00:07:56,789 --> 00:07:59,550
no method in JavaScript actually we

135
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:03,120
already have these these methods but it

136
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,759
is in global scope and now they are

137
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:08,310
moving to the number object that make a

138
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:11,610
lot of sense and then they try to fix

139
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:17,039
some some issues if your your

140
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:19,889
application using a lot of math easier

141
00:08:19,889 --> 00:08:22,650
if you are a hardcore programmer using a

142
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:27,150
lot of math you definitely check it out

143
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:30,270
all of the new methods in in math object

144
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:35,779
we have a bunch of new methods we have

145
00:08:35,779 --> 00:08:39,419
also a lot of things in array object we

146
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:42,510
have a lot of methods like our hideout

147
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:44,970
from that i will show you a head off all

148
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:49,320
right fine phil and we can also super

149
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:53,070
class in an array but here in this

150
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:55,440
example I will show you I hate out from

151
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,660
that takes an array for another thing

152
00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:02,190
like an iterator here is the Jays conf

153
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:04,680
website and then I'm just squaring the

154
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:07,110
dump looking through the today's

155
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:10,470
speakers and then I can specify a second

156
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:13,829
argument there is a map function and i'm

157
00:09:13,829 --> 00:09:15,750
using an arrow function that we will see

158
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:23,380
later and then I'm just logging the HTML

159
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:28,950
we have a shorthand in objects if you

160
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:31,410
are a JavaScript programmer we probably

161
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:35,220
you you have this common situation where

162
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:40,110
we have a name the same name for the

163
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:42,560
properties so if you want to return or

164
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:45,209
created another object you need to

165
00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:48,420
define the property and the valley even

166
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:53,070
if they are the same so with this object

167
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:55,560
literal shorthand if you have the same

168
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:58,290
name you can just put one you don't need

169
00:09:58,290 --> 00:10:00,390
to specify the property and and the

170
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:01,460
value

171
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:04,650
also we have the structuring assignment

172
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:08,010
here is a way to define it's another way

173
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:11,790
to define variables here is using the

174
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:14,610
array pattern you can just define like

175
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:18,150
this and we have also the object pattern

176
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:26,790
that looks word but it works so about

177
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:31,370
the main features who have blog scope

178
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:34,080
you see I'm using lat in the other

179
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:37,050
examples block scope the difference for

180
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:40,770
lat and for VAR i don't know if that is

181
00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:44,220
a replacement for VAR i think it is but

182
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:48,510
i see a lot of people saying that to

183
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:52,470
know that is not the replacement for VAR

184
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:56,520
but i think it is so let define a

185
00:10:56,520 --> 00:11:00,240
variable in just the disco so in this

186
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:05,070
example I'm using great enough for loop

187
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:07,650
and this block I'm creating this J

188
00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:11,460
variable so this J variable just exists

189
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:14,760
here in this block if I try to log

190
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:21,930
outside of this blocks will fail and we

191
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:25,110
have arrow functions that is well known

192
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:27,240
as lambda in other language like Python

193
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:30,200
I think C sharp and other language and

194
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:33,600
it looked like a dimebag flying v the

195
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:42,540
symbol so the error function is not

196
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:48,480
movable we we cannot make a new error

197
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,170
function that makes a lot of sense and

198
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:54,480
we doesn't have we don't have the

199
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:58,170
argument subject anymore in this error

200
00:11:58,170 --> 00:12:00,930
function and this function is always

201
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:05,360
anonymous but and we have the DS binding

202
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:12,330
fix it and we know how here is how error

203
00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:13,889
function works

204
00:12:13,889 --> 00:12:17,220
a simple way so I'm creating this this

205
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:19,850
variable it's a function and then i

206
00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:23,850
define the parent name and after the

207
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:26,489
arrow we have the return we don't need

208
00:12:26,489 --> 00:12:28,589
to specify the return so it's a pretty

209
00:12:28,589 --> 00:12:31,109
simple example in this constant dialogue

210
00:12:31,109 --> 00:12:36,660
we will output 6 because i'm passing 5

211
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:41,699
and then here x 25 and then I after the

212
00:12:41,699 --> 00:12:45,689
arrow X plus 1 will be 6 it's pretty

213
00:12:45,689 --> 00:12:50,790
simple we can have more parameters so if

214
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:53,100
you have more parameters in an error

215
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:55,499
function we need to open and close the

216
00:12:55,499 --> 00:12:59,299
parentheses and if you don't have

217
00:12:59,299 --> 00:13:02,249
parameters you need to open and close

218
00:13:02,249 --> 00:13:08,699
the parentheses like this and if your

219
00:13:08,699 --> 00:13:11,309
arrow function will need some a lot of

220
00:13:11,309 --> 00:13:15,029
codes you need to speak to you need a

221
00:13:15,029 --> 00:13:17,579
body you need to open the curly brackets

222
00:13:17,579 --> 00:13:20,790
like like this the main difference here

223
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:24,709
is that you need to return something

224
00:13:24,709 --> 00:13:31,230
okay and here is the the classical issue

225
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:35,160
with the DS every every JavaScript

226
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:40,259
programmer know this this issue left if

227
00:13:40,259 --> 00:13:42,419
we have a function inside a function and

228
00:13:42,419 --> 00:13:46,470
it's right to to take the DS we lost the

229
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:49,619
reference for this so in this example we

230
00:13:49,619 --> 00:13:51,600
will have this type error this the log

231
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,929
is not a function because here these

232
00:13:54,929 --> 00:13:59,100
doesn't have the log-log methods so we

233
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:03,899
already have a way to fix the this issue

234
00:14:03,899 --> 00:14:09,389
with es es five and here we just need to

235
00:14:09,389 --> 00:14:12,089
wrap the function with parenthesis and

236
00:14:12,089 --> 00:14:14,369
turn these into another function and

237
00:14:14,369 --> 00:14:16,889
then we can call the bite methods when

238
00:14:16,889 --> 00:14:19,279
you can pass to this but this is not a

239
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:23,789
yeah so in es6 we just use an arrow

240
00:14:23,789 --> 00:14:26,710
function and then we never lost

241
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:29,410
this reference this is pretty good

242
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:34,270
grades classes class classes are

243
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:36,450
controversial because a lot of people

244
00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:40,300
doesn't like classes in JavaScript don't

245
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:43,480
want classes in JavaScript but we have

246
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:49,050
classes in JavaScript now with es6 but

247
00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:53,500
classes are just sugar syntax okay we

248
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,870
don't have any change in the core of the

249
00:14:55,870 --> 00:15:00,120
language is just another way to do

250
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:04,780
something and how to use in class this

251
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:08,620
is a valid das six example a classical

252
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:10,930
example example we have the class

253
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:13,480
keyword we define a class animal and we

254
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:15,340
have the constructor and you have the

255
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:19,150
method here we it doesn't need to define

256
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:21,850
the function key words we just define

257
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:27,040
the method and we can extend a class and

258
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:31,150
we can use super so if you want to use

259
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:33,340
classes you can use if you don't want

260
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:40,500
you can keep with your peers on style

261
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:45,070
about modules modules is for me is one

262
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:48,160
of one of the most exciting features in

263
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:55,110
es6 but it's still changing we have the

264
00:15:55,110 --> 00:16:00,820
module loader in another spec but it's

265
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:04,720
still one of the greatest features in

266
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:08,430
JavaScript so here's how to do it

267
00:16:08,430 --> 00:16:13,150
creating a file bass is and i'm defining

268
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:17,110
a variable ok and then I'm just exports

269
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:20,020
what I want for this this module and we

270
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:23,620
have the keyword default that is if you

271
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:26,620
just have a single primary function we

272
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:29,710
can use the default in our module and

273
00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:32,530
here is how to use in in our app we just

274
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:37,210
import this module and it works here i

275
00:16:37,210 --> 00:16:39,970
am just defining a function and

276
00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:46,540
return the function and here we can have

277
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:49,810
both named it exports and default

278
00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:53,290
experts in a module and and we also can

279
00:16:53,290 --> 00:16:56,980
import a module inside another module so

280
00:16:56,980 --> 00:17:00,759
here you can see in this foo j s module

281
00:17:00,759 --> 00:17:04,510
i'm importing another module and then i

282
00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:06,939
can export the default foo that is a

283
00:17:06,939 --> 00:17:10,600
single function but i can also export

284
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:16,230
and name it this this variable bar and

285
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:20,770
for for use in my application or in

286
00:17:20,770 --> 00:17:24,280
another module I can just import the

287
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:26,949
name it with open and close the curly

288
00:17:26,949 --> 00:17:30,669
brackets here's an example that I will

289
00:17:30,669 --> 00:17:34,350
show you later how to use in modules

290
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:37,630
importing name it and default experts

291
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:43,090
and just using it and how to use in

292
00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:50,169
today I'm using now the 65 projects 65

293
00:17:50,169 --> 00:17:53,799
is a project that turns es6 code into a

294
00:17:53,799 --> 00:17:58,690
Velde es5 code so why I'm using 625 and

295
00:17:58,690 --> 00:18:01,870
not another transpiler like tracer from

296
00:18:01,870 --> 00:18:05,200
google it's because 625 it's a pretty

297
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:08,440
active project on github I think the guy

298
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:11,799
that wrote the this library works a full

299
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:16,600
day in this 65 project and we don't need

300
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:19,600
any runtime we don't need extra library

301
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,750
for use in 625 so it's great and the

302
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:26,320
generated code is human readable you can

303
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:29,350
actually open the generated code and you

304
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:31,870
can understand what what has happened

305
00:18:31,870 --> 00:18:35,530
and if you want to use modules with

306
00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:38,640
kamoj is you can plug browser file and

307
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,590
you can known as grant or another go

308
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:45,780
pour broccoli or whatever you want for

309
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:49,600
so here is an example that is in my

310
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,240
github and I will try to

311
00:18:52,240 --> 00:19:15,540
demonstrate

312
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:21,170
so here uncreated this grunt file that

313
00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:25,640
just use 625 and use browserify and I

314
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:33,730
can run I can I don't know if you know

315
00:19:33,730 --> 00:19:36,830
okay believe in me I'm running grant and

316
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:41,030
I specifying that I want you to convert

317
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:45,890
my modules to come on Jas i think is

318
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:53,480
commodious so i can use como eso I can

319
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:58,250
run with notes so here now run I'm in

320
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:10,370
the sample and come on fjs and then i

321
00:20:10,370 --> 00:20:15,230
have my modules working with browserify

322
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:17,540
but if I want to use this in the browser

323
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:36,870
I can just serve the my folder

324
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:45,500
I can see the bar

325
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:52,310
so okay the thing is I can run the

326
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:55,170
modules and I can turn into comedy as

327
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:57,570
modules or AMD modules so I can run a

328
00:20:57,570 --> 00:21:00,690
node which commonjs I can run in the

329
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:02,490
browser with comedy is using browserify

330
00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:06,180
and I can run I can turn into AMG

331
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:08,310
asynchronous motors definition and I can

332
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:10,440
run if I want a synchronous motor

333
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:15,510
loading in the browser so here's the es6

334
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:19,820
super today and there's no bug in this

335
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:24,840
discharge yeah this is true internet

336
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:30,260
explorer is seventy percent of es6

337
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:33,750
implementation so we have firefox with

338
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:37,950
60 so we are almost there okay yes six

339
00:21:37,950 --> 00:21:41,670
will be officially releasing amides 2015

340
00:21:41,670 --> 00:21:45,000
and if you're using frameworks like

341
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,430
these popular frameworks they are also

342
00:21:47,430 --> 00:21:49,980
moving to year 6 modules and another

343
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:53,370
year 6 features and here's a project

344
00:21:53,370 --> 00:21:56,460
that i mentioned es6 rocks calm is a

345
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:59,310
weds website for spread the information

346
00:21:59,310 --> 00:22:03,060
about es6 and today we are launching a

347
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:06,480
new version of es6 rocks so if you will

348
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:10,200
try yes 6 rocks com we have a beautiful

349
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:15,720
new website and last thing to build this

350
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:18,810
website i created armani key there is a

351
00:22:18,810 --> 00:22:22,110
static site generator using es6 features

352
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:26,250
you need to check it out on github and

353
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:30,090
contribute and as it the here is my my
