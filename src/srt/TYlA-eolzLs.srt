00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:18,400

[Applause]

2
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:19,859
how about now

3
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:23,820
yeah there we go cool hey hello my name

4
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:25,470
is Steven as I was just introduced and

5
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:27,180
I'm gonna be talking about CSS animation

6
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:29,400
and going beyond just using transitions

7
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:32,850
and so except my name's Steven Roberts

8
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:34,829
you can follow me on Twitter and club

9
00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:36,480
pen the links are across the bottom the

10
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,030
whole way I'm in this industry

11
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:41,280
for around about 10 years I did a lot of

12
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,020
agency work and then have since moved on

13
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:45,149
to a company called assembler where I

14
00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:47,070
now do a lot of design development and

15
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:51,510
UX I sort of look after all of that but

16
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:53,039
enough about me and that's not why

17
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:54,960
you're here so why bother to animate it

18
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,820
all well animation can be used for a

19
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:59,699
number of reasons I use animation to

20
00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:02,190
delight your users so simple animations

21
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:04,140
can really create a memorable experience

22
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:05,790
can get people coming back to your

23
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:09,210
website to to to see the things that

24
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:10,979
you've done and you can really just grab

25
00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:12,510
people's attention with really nice

26
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:16,530
simple animations so use animation to

27
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:18,630
inform so this is using the animation to

28
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:20,520
inform the user that something has

29
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:22,650
changed or something is happening this

30
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:24,960
is especially useful when submitting

31
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,900
forms or pulling down theater or

32
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:29,759
anything like that because you'll be

33
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:31,710
able to give a visual indication that

34
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:33,240
something's happening in the browser and

35
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,970
it's not just pong it's not just stopped

36
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:38,250
things like this tend to stop users from

37
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:39,720
clicking around or clicking the button

38
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,040
three or four times as we saw in the

39
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,909
other talk so you can sort of help add

40
00:01:44,909 --> 00:01:47,280
your user just few visual cues in

41
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,950
animation and finally use animation to

42
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:51,990
confirm so this is quite similar except

43
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:53,430
it's just confirm that something's

44
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:55,380
happened confirm that the debt has been

45
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:57,420
sent confirm that something's loading

46
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:00,960
and all those sorts of things so why

47
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,090
bother to animate in CSS so CSS is

48
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:05,369
performant simple and powerful and you

49
00:02:05,369 --> 00:02:06,750
can see they're performing has a little

50
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:08,550
asterisk next to it that's because we

51
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:10,349
only have a few safe properties that we

52
00:02:10,349 --> 00:02:12,900
that we can animate in CSS and there's a

53
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:13,920
transform or pass

54
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,080
geom filter and while that may seem

55
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,610
quite limiting there's quite a lot you

56
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:20,130
can do with just those properties and

57
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:21,390
it's worth noting as well that in the

58
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:22,920
future this won't be as much of a

59
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:25,800
problem things like the Firefox quantum

60
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,170
engine will take away a lot of that pain

61
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:29,760
and the only reason you can't use the

62
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,170
other properties or you shouldn't use

63
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:33,209
them as much is because it will cause

64
00:02:33,209 --> 00:02:35,250
Jan Kaas to will cause your animations

65
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:37,350
to slow down it will cause quite a lot

66
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:42,019
of performance issues or it could so why

67
00:02:42,019 --> 00:02:44,580
why go beyond transitions what's wrong

68
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:47,310
with transitions then this is my

69
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:52,260
favorite slide okay so and we just look

70
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:53,580
at a couple of transitions now some of

71
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:55,410
them are fairly simple this is probably

72
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:57,150
things you've done before so as we hover

73
00:02:57,150 --> 00:03:00,680
over here and we change the color and

74
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,120
then on this next one when we hover over

75
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,910
it it changes to an X so you can see

76
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:08,430
there the the transition code itself is

77
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:10,709
just stroke 250 milliseconds and then

78
00:03:10,709 --> 00:03:12,900
we're going to apply a timing function

79
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:15,090
of easing out and then same for this one

80
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:16,680
except we're going to animate all of the

81
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:20,220
properties not just the color and then

82
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:22,560
magic happens because it's not quite

83
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,880
that simple you still gotta tell it when

84
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:27,660
and what to animate so here that menu

85
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:29,790
turn it into a cross is made up of four

86
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:33,269
lines so the the middle bit is two lines

87
00:03:33,269 --> 00:03:35,100
stacked on top of each other so then

88
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:37,590
when we hover over we hide the top and

89
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:39,810
bottom lines and then transform the

90
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:45,849
middle lines out over to Korea across

91
00:03:45,859 --> 00:03:50,010
simple issue so one more quick example

92
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:52,230
and so these are just some cards that

93
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:53,549
you might have on any typical website

94
00:03:53,549 --> 00:03:55,680
and the bottom corner is going to be

95
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,130
used to to show a category or to show a

96
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:02,040
name or something like that and as we

97
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:04,890
hover over that's revealed so again this

98
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:07,410
is using transitions now animation so

99
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:12,060
upon hover we're going to change the

100
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:13,530
border width of the after and the

101
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:16,709
opacity of the before so the after is

102
00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:19,200
the the rectangular corner and the

103
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:23,940
before is the text so it's pretty cool

104
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:26,700
so transitions are awesome but limited

105
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:27,810
we can only animate from

106
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:29,580
value to another and we require some

107
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:31,560
sort of interaction in order for it to

108
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:34,080
fire so this is why we're going to go

109
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:40,530
beyond transitions so none of this is is

110
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:42,510
exactly new CSS animations have been

111
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:44,820
around forever so why am i standing on a

112
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:46,790
stage in 2019 talking to you about it

113
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:49,050
because it just feels them to use it

114
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:51,450
feels since since Apple went and killed

115
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:53,700
flash the the animations taken a bit of

116
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:55,230
a backseat on the web no one seems to

117
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:56,850
really be doing much with it there's a

118
00:04:56,850 --> 00:04:57,990
couple of websites where you're like oh

119
00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:00,030
that's cool but that's kind of about it

120
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:02,820
whereas we've got this tool in in CSS

121
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:05,700
that has quite a simple syntax you can

122
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:07,770
do so much with it and we can bring the

123
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:10,200
web to life again like it was back

124
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:15,060
before Apple okay so I'm gonna stop

125
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:16,710
complaining now and inspire and said or

126
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:18,240
at least try so this is the first

127
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,410
animation we're going to look at and

128
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:21,120
it's a simple scrolling Mouse you've

129
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,290
probably seen something like this they

130
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:24,000
usually sit at the bottom of like a hero

131
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,919
area or something just to indicate to

132
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:29,220
the user that you can scroll down so how

133
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:30,000
does it work

134
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,880
so this animation is made up of an SVG

135
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,770
and just two elements inside there

136
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:36,570
there's a rectangle in a circle and

137
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:39,630
we've given them both a class name so

138
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:41,490
the first thing to do is to style the

139
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:44,160
the elements within our SVG so we're

140
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,870
just going to give a stroke color and

141
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:48,330
width a fill color and an opacity for

142
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:51,030
the the actual scroll and then we can

143
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:53,910
see we've managed to style our style our

144
00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:56,639
mouse then we can move once we've got

145
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:57,840
our styling we can move on to the

146
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,930
animation so here we're saying we have a

147
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:02,700
keyframe animation called scroll and

148
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:06,060
from 0 to 20% we're not going to do

149
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:09,000
anything and then from 20% to 100% we're

150
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,880
going to move along the y-axis 36 pixels

151
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:14,039
and then we're also going to elongate

152
00:06:14,039 --> 00:06:16,110
the shape which is by stretching it

153
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:18,479
along the y-axis using scale Y and then

154
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:21,240
we're also going to fade it out so now

155
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,860
we've created our animation we need to

156
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:25,260
set that so we give it an animation name

157
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:29,400
duration and an inspiration count and it

158
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:34,650
didn't work so why didn't it work so we

159
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:35,760
were missing the transform origin

160
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:38,789
property so this is quite important when

161
00:06:38,789 --> 00:06:40,470
you're animating especially with SVG and

162
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:41,800
things like that because then not

163
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,990
using the regular Dom they have their

164
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:48,850
own Dom separate to HTML one so here

165
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:50,740
we're saying we're going to transform

166
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:53,710
from the center and from 20 pixels and

167
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:55,479
then once we've applied that we can see

168
00:06:55,479 --> 00:06:57,310
it's starting to move down over where it

169
00:06:57,310 --> 00:06:58,750
was kind of just stretched on the spot

170
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:03,610
before so it's nearly what we had as the

171
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:05,410
example but not quite so he's the two

172
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:07,389
side-by-side the one on the Left sort of

173
00:07:07,389 --> 00:07:09,220
dropping down and stretching and the one

174
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:11,770
on the right is what we're aiming for so

175
00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:13,150
without going back and changing our

176
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:15,699
animation we can accomplish that with

177
00:07:15,699 --> 00:07:17,620
one line of code so here we're just

178
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:19,539
using the animation timing function and

179
00:07:19,539 --> 00:07:22,090
we're using cubic Bezier instead of one

180
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:24,130
of the preset values like linear or ease

181
00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:26,310
in or ease out or anything like that and

182
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:28,780
but cubic Bezier just allows you to add

183
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:31,599
custom functions and the numbers look

184
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:32,979
horrible but don't worry about that this

185
00:07:32,979 --> 00:07:34,360
generator isn't all that sort of thing

186
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,440
out there so you can go and have a play

187
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,289
and see what looks good what doesn't and

188
00:07:38,289 --> 00:07:40,720
what you're aiming for so then when we

189
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,550
apply that you can see we now sort of

190
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:44,139
have that nice or particular little as

191
00:07:44,139 --> 00:07:46,210
itself goes up and then comes down again

192
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:51,010
so in less than two three minutes of

193
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:52,810
talking we've gone from completely

194
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:58,810
installed SVG to a finished animation so

195
00:07:58,810 --> 00:07:59,830
it's no bad but you've probably seen

196
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:02,229
something like that before let's see if

197
00:08:02,229 --> 00:08:09,460
I can really impress you this time so

198
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:11,380
this animation is created entirely with

199
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:17,480
SVG and CSS

200
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:23,080
so how did I do it so the the key to

201
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:26,250
this is the the animation steps function

202
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:28,870
we'll come back to that in a moment but

203
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:30,730
that's really the key to what's

204
00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:34,300
happening here so step one for creating

205
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:35,620
this animation was creating the image

206
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:38,140
itself so start by drawing one of the

207
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:41,560
poses as a vector I think I used sketch

208
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:43,180
but you can use whatever you want and

209
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:45,460
then you go ahead and draw the remaining

210
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:48,670
poses in my case that ended up being ten

211
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:50,950
and that was because it was a time

212
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:52,540
factor that I needed to get the work

213
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:53,770
done

214
00:08:53,770 --> 00:08:55,360
tends a nice round number for doing

215
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:59,440
maths which is always fun and ten

216
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,930
actually works okay in terms of not

217
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:07,750
seeing seen it stutter as it replays so

218
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:09,010
once I had all of my separate bird

219
00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:11,110
elements I split them into equally sized

220
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:13,839
cells the actual boxes aren't needed

221
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:15,490
that's just to show you where I've

222
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:20,080
positioned the birds and then now that

223
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,790
we've done that we can move on to make

224
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:26,080
the bird fly so in our HTML we create an

225
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,030
element can be a div or whatever you

226
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:29,890
want and give that a class of bird and

227
00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:31,570
we then set that image we've just

228
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:33,970
created as the background for our

229
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:36,580
element I will then set in a width and

230
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:38,290
height and we're using the will change

231
00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:41,110
property which is a performance property

232
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:42,760
we will just send that the background

233
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:45,310
position is going to change so if you

234
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:47,080
prepare yourself for that we're just

235
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,310
telling the browser that this is going

236
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:49,810
to change prepare yourself and then we

237
00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:52,150
hopefully will see less studies and

238
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:54,190
things like that and the width and

239
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:56,230
height I'll come back to here so the the

240
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:58,410
height was just a random number I chose

241
00:09:58,410 --> 00:10:01,480
125 pixels looked good and then to get

242
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:04,120
the width we take the size of our

243
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:06,400
original SVG divide that by the number

244
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,690
of frames and that will give us the

245
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:09,880
width of one frame so that ended up

246
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:12,640
being 88 pixels so when we look at that

247
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,890
we can see that that's just one frame of

248
00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:20,440
that image so if we go to our our actual

249
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,959
animation and create that luckily here

250
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:25,630
we just need one line and that's it so

251
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:27,760
our animation fly cycle just says when

252
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,140
you get to the end the background

253
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:29,660
position will

254
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:34,210
moved negative 900 pixels on the x-axis

255
00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:37,610
then we apply that so we apply the

256
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:39,740
animation now like I said the animation

257
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:42,650
timing function what that is doing is

258
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:45,200
instead of like linear or moving from

259
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,210
one element to another it's going to

260
00:10:47,210 --> 00:10:48,740
step through whatever you tell it

261
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:50,750
however many times you tell it to so

262
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,070
because we're moving background position

263
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:54,290
and we're doing it over 10 steps it's

264
00:10:54,290 --> 00:10:56,420
going to move across that image 10 times

265
00:10:56,420 --> 00:11:00,190
in the number of in the time that we set

266
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:02,810
so I'm setting it to repeat infinitely

267
00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:05,810
so it's just going to keep going and so

268
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:07,450
then I'm setting the duration and delay

269
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:09,440
for the first burden I'm send the

270
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,910
animation duration is going to take one

271
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:13,100
second and I've set a negative to lay

272
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:15,230
here and what that does is say that once

273
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:17,390
the page loads the animation will

274
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:22,550
already be running so that's our bird

275
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:26,990
flying on the spot so now that we've got

276
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:28,250
one we can go and create multiple

277
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:30,980
variations of that in my case I've

278
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:33,200
created four so we have birds to three

279
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,500
inform using modifiers to to set the

280
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:37,580
names and then I'm just setting

281
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:39,740
different durations and delays and by

282
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:41,390
doing that we're using the same element

283
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:43,610
and the same animation but we're just

284
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:45,860
offsetting them slightly and what that

285
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:48,650
does is create a nonlinear repeatable

286
00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:51,440
animation so all of these are exactly

287
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,200
the same but just running in different

288
00:11:54,200 --> 00:12:00,290
timings and different delays so now that

289
00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:02,330
we've got our bird flying on the spot we

290
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:06,330
now need to move it across the screen

291
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:09,800
so first of all we position rough Albert

292
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,570
in a container position that container

293
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:15,290
off the page and then we can move on to

294
00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:18,170
our animation and this is actually a bit

295
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:19,610
more complicated than the last few I've

296
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:22,280
shown there's a number of steps to it

297
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:24,950
and so that to begin with I'm saying the

298
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:27,920
translate Y value which is opened down

299
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:31,430
on the the y axis is 0 translate X is

300
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:33,050
minus 10 so we're pushing it off to the

301
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:34,640
off to the left and then I've set the

302
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:37,430
scale down to now point 3 and as we

303
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:38,960
reach 10% of our way through our

304
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:42,230
animation we're just moving along the y

305
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:43,190
axis

306
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:45,350
along the x-axis so what we're doing

307
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:47,420
there is is not just flying in a

308
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:48,770
straight line from left to right we're

309
00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:50,870
sort of going up and down as we go and

310
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:52,760
I'm also setting the scale up and down

311
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,890
as we go to give the illusion of depth

312
00:12:54,890 --> 00:12:56,930
so by doing that it sort of looks like

313
00:12:56,930 --> 00:12:58,070
the birds getting closer and further

314
00:12:58,070 --> 00:13:01,190
away by changing its scale and there's a

315
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:02,870
number of steps between there but by the

316
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:05,210
time we reach 60% of the way for our

317
00:13:05,210 --> 00:13:07,910
animation I want it to be finished so

318
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:09,590
it's going to be off the other side of

319
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:13,190
the screen and not visible anymore now

320
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:15,880
the reason for stopping at 60% and

321
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:18,830
repeating those values at 100 is that

322
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:20,150
when it were if we want to create a

323
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:23,510
delay between the animation iterations

324
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:25,400
there's no syntax to do that you can't

325
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,950
say you know repeat infinitely but delay

326
00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:29,690
3 seconds between each one there's no

327
00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:31,790
way to do that so the way that you do it

328
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:34,610
is by setting the same values as

329
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:37,100
different parts of your key frames so by

330
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:39,200
60% we're finished but it's going to

331
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,660
keep running until at 100% and still be

332
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:43,940
off the side so then when it comes back

333
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:46,160
around the others will still be going

334
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:49,790
which you'll see in a moment so we need

335
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:52,190
to apply that we've got a timing

336
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:55,520
function of just linear and the duration

337
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:56,960
color is infinite so it's just going to

338
00:13:56,960 --> 00:14:00,740
keep going and we've set the name so we

339
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:02,750
need to do what we did for set our

340
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:05,600
duration and delay and then we can say

341
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:12,350
it going says our first bird

342
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,399
so feelin Korea are other variations

343
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:16,499
like we did with the the single-bird

344
00:14:16,499 --> 00:14:18,269
just set different durations different

345
00:14:18,269 --> 00:14:18,779
delays

346
00:14:18,779 --> 00:14:20,610
I'm not saying negative delays here

347
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:22,079
because I want them to sort of follow

348
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:23,610
each other across the screen so it's

349
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:25,589
delays of one two three four seconds

350
00:14:25,589 --> 00:14:27,809
something like that and then we can see

351
00:14:27,809 --> 00:14:39,410
that run

352
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:41,970
go right

353
00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:45,580
so what else and so this is animation I

354
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:48,670
created for assembler for favoriting

355
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:52,900
your suppliers and when we run it it

356
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:55,510
sort of grows shrinks fills in and we

357
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:57,220
get those lovely sort of pop-up circles

358
00:14:57,220 --> 00:15:03,460
around it so how did we do that again we

359
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:07,330
turn to SVG first we create our image so

360
00:15:07,330 --> 00:15:11,020
we create our SVG create a path give it

361
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:12,850
an ID and then we can move on to

362
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:14,470
actually write our heart shape which is

363
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:18,670
nice and simple m1 2.7 four five one six

364
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:21,760
now kidding use something like sketch or

365
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,620
a some sort of vector edit there is

366
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:25,750
somewhere way where it can output this

367
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:26,890
for you so that you don't have to write

368
00:15:26,890 --> 00:15:29,230
yourself all credit to you if you can

369
00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:32,080
write a heart in SVG without using an

370
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:38,180
editor and so there we have our ship

371
00:15:38,190 --> 00:15:41,500
export that as an SVG and then we're

372
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,780
going to add the circles in afterwards

373
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:46,000
we'll do this just by hand because this

374
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,110
is really simple it's just eight circles

375
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:51,220
so we just create a group for them

376
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:53,470
position that group in the center and

377
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:57,970
then just create eight circles so our

378
00:15:57,970 --> 00:16:00,810
next step is to create that animation

379
00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:03,970
but as before we need to create our

380
00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:06,520
initial styling for our SVG so we're set

381
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:08,380
in a stroke a stroke width of fill color

382
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:09,670
and then we're set in the transform

383
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:11,770
origin and then there's our initial

384
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:15,430
styling for our heart so next we can

385
00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:16,900
move on to create the animation and

386
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:19,990
we're going to animate the transform

387
00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:25,480
fill and Stroke so if we start with the

388
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:28,000
color at 33% of the way through our

389
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,330
animation we want the fill to amend the

390
00:16:31,330 --> 00:16:33,580
same color but the stroke to change and

391
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:35,680
then by the end we want both the stroke

392
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:41,020
and the fill color to have changed the

393
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:42,790
reason for that will become apparent in

394
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:46,450
a moment so then once we've done the

395
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:48,460
color we can look at our scale so we

396
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:50,890
want to say by that 33% mark which when

397
00:16:50,890 --> 00:16:52,300
our

398
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:55,360
stroke has changed but the actual fill

399
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,640
hasn't we want the heart to shrink and

400
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:59,680
then as it's doing the rest we want to

401
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,840
come to come up above its original size

402
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:04,209
and then back down to its original size

403
00:17:04,209 --> 00:17:07,540
so by setting the scale to match the

404
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:09,400
stroke color and then how about

405
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,290
everything else happen at the end we

406
00:17:11,290 --> 00:17:12,580
managed to sort of choreograph our

407
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:15,190
animation so as it's getting smaller The

408
00:17:15,190 --> 00:17:16,510
Strokes filling in and then as it's

409
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:18,730
coming back up that's when it starts to

410
00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:25,000
fill and fill the color itself so then

411
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,390
we can move on to our circles and again

412
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:31,180
initial styling we just want to position

413
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:33,280
them the reason for the transition there

414
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,390
have just been really sharp

415
00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:36,310
one-millisecond is because on the

416
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:37,960
reverse when you click it for a second

417
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,430
time I don't want it to animate back in

418
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:41,050
I just want it to stop

419
00:17:41,050 --> 00:17:44,980
and then we've positioned them there

420
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:46,600
they are all on top of each other all

421
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:49,120
eight circles and then we need to

422
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,770
position them in the right position so

423
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:54,070
here I'm using a for loop in sass but

424
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:55,920
you could do this by hand if you wanted

425
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,520
I'm just saying

426
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:02,170
rotate each of the circles by the the

427
00:18:02,170 --> 00:18:04,870
iteration that we're on and 45 degrees

428
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:07,390
so it'll increase by 45 each time and

429
00:18:07,390 --> 00:18:09,250
then we're going to move it out over

430
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:12,670
away from the center on the x-axis it's

431
00:18:12,670 --> 00:18:15,540
important to know that if you do the

432
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:18,550
translate before the rotate it will

433
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:20,620
perform them in that order so it will

434
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:22,270
move and then rotate it as opposed to

435
00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:25,210
rotating then moving so it's definitely

436
00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:27,970
worth knowing so there we have our

437
00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:30,730
positions of our circles around the

438
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:34,450
heart so next we just want to move those

439
00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:35,890
cells to when it's actually active

440
00:18:35,890 --> 00:18:38,500
because we don't want the hearts circles

441
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:41,230
to be positioned around like that all of

442
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:45,040
the time so we can create some

443
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,600
additional styles for when it is active

444
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:48,330
and all we're doing here is just saying

445
00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:51,270
for the circles we're going to transform

446
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:53,830
so we transition the transform property

447
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:55,270
in the opacity property so we're going

448
00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:59,380
to animate the moving left and the

449
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:03,200
fading out

450
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:05,530
so this is really slowed down so you can

451
00:19:05,530 --> 00:19:15,740
see exactly what's happening

452
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:17,670
and then this is the actual size and

453
00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:23,050
speed that it runs out on the website

454
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:27,470
cool the boats were better right

455
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:31,230
so what else so this is an animation I

456
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:33,960
created for for an M framework that I

457
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:36,510
wrote a long time ago now and but the

458
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:38,040
animation I think is still really cool

459
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:43,200
and there's nothing on here that I

460
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,000
haven't already showed you how to do so

461
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,890
the majority of what's going on here is

462
00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:49,650
just translate or transform so

463
00:19:49,650 --> 00:19:52,380
translating the y-axis or translating

464
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:55,280
the x-axis and then I'm just hiding the

465
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:59,040
overflow so on the the slider in the

466
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:01,800
middle that's just using steps like I

467
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,090
did for the birds and it's just stepping

468
00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:04,830
through the animation is supposed to be

469
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:07,320
in smooth and then again with the scroll

470
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:08,940
in ones they're just to smooth up and

471
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:11,310
down animation so the only thing

472
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:13,680
different here is the the actual drawing

473
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:19,320
which happens at first so how do we draw

474
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:23,550
in code we can do this with CSS and we

475
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:26,070
can do this with SVG so the two

476
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:27,690
properties that we need to do this at

477
00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:30,560
the stroke - array and stroke - offset

478
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:34,020
so the circle itself I'm sorry the

479
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:36,270
circle itself I've created a circle it's

480
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:39,230
worth knowing and we set a stroke width

481
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:42,270
color and then we've set a - array of 50

482
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:43,800
so setting the - array is just gonna put

483
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:46,440
gaps in the stroke and the number you

484
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:48,660
set inside the dasher is the number is

485
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:51,270
how big the gap will be so by setting

486
00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:53,160
the gap to 50 we can see we've created a

487
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:55,710
50 pixel gap and then a 50 pixel stroke

488
00:20:55,710 --> 00:20:57,870
and then a 50 pixel gap and it'll just

489
00:20:57,870 --> 00:21:01,980
repeat infinitely so if we take that

490
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:03,720
stroke - array and increase it to be the

491
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,460
full circumference of the circle which

492
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:08,280
in this case is 940 we have a stroke

493
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:10,170
that covers the entire circle but we

494
00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:12,060
also have a gap that will cover the

495
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:15,570
entire circle as well so if we then move

496
00:21:15,570 --> 00:21:17,430
on to offset this is where we can start

497
00:21:17,430 --> 00:21:19,650
offsetting where the stroke drawing

498
00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:22,680
starts so by setting that to 50 we

499
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:24,630
create like a little bit of that we

500
00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:26,640
start to see 50 pixels of that gap and

501
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,260
the rest is of the stroke that we've

502
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:29,070
created

503
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:31,410
and if we set the gap to be all the way

504
00:21:31,410 --> 00:21:32,850
up to the circumference of our circle

505
00:21:32,850 --> 00:21:36,360
the same as they as the - array was we

506
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:39,540
then have no stroke whatsoever we do but

507
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:40,980
it's just hitting because it's been

508
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:43,790
pushed off and we're only seeing the gap

509
00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:46,200
so then we can animate that so once

510
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,060
we've pushed all of our outlines out of

511
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:49,920
the way so that we we can't see any of

512
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:52,170
them we can animate that back into view

513
00:21:52,170 --> 00:21:55,260
using keyframes so I've got a keyframe

514
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:57,060
animation here called draw and we're

515
00:21:57,060 --> 00:21:58,950
setting the stroke - offset back to zero

516
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:01,800
so it's gone from 9:40 buck-20 where it

517
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:05,430
started then all I need to do is run

518
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:06,870
that animation so we set the animation

519
00:22:06,870 --> 00:22:09,900
name the duration and then I'm setting

520
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:12,270
fill mode animation film mode here to

521
00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:14,220
forwards and basically all that means is

522
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:15,660
once you reach the end of the animation

523
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:17,580
don't go back to what its original value

524
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:20,040
was just keep the keep the values from

525
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:23,310
the end and then when we run that you

526
00:22:23,310 --> 00:22:25,350
can see we've drawn the outline of the

527
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:32,490
circle so literally all I've done there

528
00:22:32,490 --> 00:22:35,370
is just apply two different different

529
00:22:35,370 --> 00:22:36,990
durations and different delays and

530
00:22:36,990 --> 00:22:38,130
things like that and then the whole

531
00:22:38,130 --> 00:22:43,950
thing gets drawn on Lord so one more

532
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:48,960
example this is where the the talk

533
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:52,590
really came from about a year year and a

534
00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:55,350
half ago I brought a article for web

535
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:57,600
designer Marc and as part of that we

536
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,120
went and looked at a whole bunch of

537
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,710
animations from around the web that were

538
00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:03,810
doing either using flash or JavaScript

539
00:23:03,810 --> 00:23:05,490
or something like that and we looked to

540
00:23:05,490 --> 00:23:07,890
see if we could recreate them all in CSS

541
00:23:07,890 --> 00:23:11,010
and the whole point of this was this was

542
00:23:11,010 --> 00:23:12,540
the cover for the the piece when it came

543
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:15,870
out it was an actual print magazine so

544
00:23:15,870 --> 00:23:17,940
we decided that we would also on top of

545
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:20,670
that doing animation of the cover using

546
00:23:20,670 --> 00:23:22,260
all of the techniques that that we've

547
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:25,350
discussed so I thought it would be nice

548
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:27,420
way to event my talk would be to talk

549
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:30,540
about this particular animation and how

550
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:35,280
we got there so the the bit I'd like to

551
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,660
talk about specifically is this little

552
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:39,210
jumping I

553
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:42,620
so how did I do it so again it's it's

554
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:46,940
all SVG but then we jumped into our into

555
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:48,500
our code and we we start creating our

556
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:50,660
keyframes so we're saying here that our

557
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:53,270
keyframes called bounce and then out 25%

558
00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:54,350
of the way through the animation we're

559
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:56,330
going to move up along the y-axis 24

560
00:23:56,330 --> 00:23:58,910
pixels and then by 35% the animation

561
00:23:58,910 --> 00:24:01,370
were back down on the ground so when we

562
00:24:01,370 --> 00:24:07,990
run that it works but it's kind of dull

563
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:11,000
doesn't really have any life to it it

564
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,880
doesn't feel real it doesn't even

565
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:16,190
doesn't even feel like a cartoon it just

566
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:20,480
looks a bit bland and so we want to

567
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,950
breathe some life into our animation we

568
00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:23,840
want to see if we can sprinkle some of

569
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:26,180
that Pixar magic on it so when I need to

570
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:27,920
do something like that what I tend to do

571
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,300
is turn to storyboarding and

572
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:31,190
storyboarding allows you to quickly plan

573
00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:33,500
your animations as you can see you do

574
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:36,440
not need to be able to draw um but

575
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:38,200
basically all this is doing is saying

576
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:41,240
number one is where we will start number

577
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:43,250
two we're going to duck down ready to to

578
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:46,100
jump number three is reaching the top of

579
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:48,230
our jump number four is the London and

580
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:49,970
then five and six is that kind of

581
00:24:49,970 --> 00:24:51,830
springing back into position once you've

582
00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:55,880
landed so once you've got your plan how

583
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:59,780
do you call it that so step one which

584
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:01,370
we're saying is ducking down ready to

585
00:25:01,370 --> 00:25:04,100
jump we're going to scale the y-axis so

586
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:05,240
we're going to squash it along the

587
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:08,330
y-axis 80% so we're going to scale from

588
00:25:08,330 --> 00:25:11,510
in this big down to here and the next

589
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:13,430
point is our actual jump so at that

590
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:14,840
point we're going to move along the

591
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:17,330
y-axis like we had before up 24 pixels

592
00:25:17,330 --> 00:25:19,370
but then also going to bring the scale

593
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:21,410
back up to its normal size because when

594
00:25:21,410 --> 00:25:23,510
you jump you tend to stretch out as you

595
00:25:23,510 --> 00:25:25,780
reach the top of your jump I've also

596
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:29,330
there I'm bringing the animation on 25

597
00:25:29,330 --> 00:25:32,540
to 27 percent of the way through by

598
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:35,180
having that sort of that little bit in

599
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:37,280
the middle of 25 26 and 27 where it's

600
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:39,380
all got the same properties it means a

601
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:40,640
little sort of hung at the top of the

602
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:41,900
jump a little bit before coming back

603
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:47,420
down so then step 3 was the London so 35

604
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:49,130
percent of our animation we're landing

605
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:51,140
again we've gone we've ducked down we've

606
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:52,519
gone off we come in

607
00:25:52,519 --> 00:25:54,109
back down for the London's or translate

608
00:25:54,109 --> 00:25:57,709
why is it zero our scale is a 95 percent

609
00:25:57,709 --> 00:25:59,029
of its original size because when you

610
00:25:59,029 --> 00:26:01,359
land you tend to shrink slightly and

611
00:26:01,359 --> 00:26:04,190
then our last one is bringing that sort

612
00:26:04,190 --> 00:26:06,769
of spring back to to where its original

613
00:26:06,769 --> 00:26:08,809
position was and again I'm finishing

614
00:26:08,809 --> 00:26:11,899
here at like 40 percent because I wanted

615
00:26:11,899 --> 00:26:14,359
to run and I wanted to repeat infinitely

616
00:26:14,359 --> 00:26:17,229
but I'd I want that delay between

617
00:26:17,229 --> 00:26:22,009
between repeats so again that springing

618
00:26:22,009 --> 00:26:24,619
back is so we've dropped down and 95 and

619
00:26:24,619 --> 00:26:30,320
then we go back up to 1 so really we've

620
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:34,249
we've added 5 or 6 different steps to

621
00:26:34,249 --> 00:26:36,649
this animation and we've managed to make

622
00:26:36,649 --> 00:26:39,469
it look a lot more alive and feel much

623
00:26:39,469 --> 00:26:41,299
more playful than it did before oh it

624
00:26:41,299 --> 00:26:46,789
was just up straight back down and then

625
00:26:46,789 --> 00:26:49,339
in con I in context with all of the

626
00:26:49,339 --> 00:26:51,919
others you can see we're just doing the

627
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:53,690
same thing with the ears so the the

628
00:26:53,690 --> 00:26:56,209
flushing is again use the same animation

629
00:26:56,209 --> 00:26:59,239
they're just offset delays same with the

630
00:26:59,239 --> 00:27:01,070
the jumping eyes they both use the same

631
00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:06,649
animation it's just different delays so

632
00:27:06,649 --> 00:27:08,089
all of the animations I've shown you

633
00:27:08,089 --> 00:27:10,639
have in common well they're all created

634
00:27:10,639 --> 00:27:12,950
with this I have CSS and the majority of

635
00:27:12,950 --> 00:27:16,190
them were created with SVG but most of

636
00:27:16,190 --> 00:27:18,259
all it's it's that the majority of them

637
00:27:18,259 --> 00:27:21,079
are simple and effective it's it's

638
00:27:21,079 --> 00:27:23,599
simple in its idea it's not you know

639
00:27:23,599 --> 00:27:25,549
trying to be overly complicated it's not

640
00:27:25,549 --> 00:27:28,429
trying to do too much and I think that's

641
00:27:28,429 --> 00:27:30,619
kind of the key to a lot of animation is

642
00:27:30,619 --> 00:27:32,869
finding something that that's quite

643
00:27:32,869 --> 00:27:35,979
simple but really grabs your attention

644
00:27:35,979 --> 00:27:37,849
so hope I've managed to leave you

645
00:27:37,849 --> 00:27:40,099
feeling inspired and to go have a play

646
00:27:40,099 --> 00:27:42,919
with SVG and CSS animations there's a

647
00:27:42,919 --> 00:27:44,329
collection of everything I've talked

648
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:46,669
about over on code pen I will tweet that

649
00:27:46,669 --> 00:27:47,899
link out there so if you want to follow

650
00:27:47,899 --> 00:27:49,700
me out learn I'll make sure that gets

651
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:58,690
out there and thank you
