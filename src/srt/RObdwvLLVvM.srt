00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:11,130
good afternoon

4
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:13,920
CSS Kampf my name is Elise and I work on

5
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,900
the front end core team at indeed comm

6
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:17,869
which is the world's number one job site

7
00:00:17,869 --> 00:00:20,580
today I want to talk about our working

8
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:23,000
theory of modern web development

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,369
components but let's start with another

10
00:00:26,369 --> 00:00:31,109
theory the law of gravity Newton's law

11
00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:33,180
of universal gravitation states that

12
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:36,300
gravity a mysterious unexplained force

13
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:39,050
works on all objects in the universe

14
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:41,790
objects attract each other based on

15
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:44,579
their mass and distance more massive

16
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:46,320
objects attract each other with a

17
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,230
greater gravitational force and this is

18
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:51,329
what sends the planets in their great

19
00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:54,899
orbits around the Sun newton's principia

20
00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:58,620
mathematica was published in 1687 after

21
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:00,180
its publication the greatest

22
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:02,309
mathematical minds in Europe used

23
00:01:02,309 --> 00:01:04,409
newton's law to discover and prove

24
00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:06,799
truths about the celestial world

25
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:09,479
astronomers worked out sophisticated

26
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:10,979
descriptions of the orbits of the

27
00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:14,310
planets called tables tables showed

28
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:16,080
where the planets should appear in the

29
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,110
sky and the calculations always matched

30
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:22,770
the real observations but over time

31
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:25,080
small discoveries begin to accumulate

32
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,939
that didn't make sense

33
00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:29,130
the first observation of what would

34
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:30,720
later be known to us as the planet

35
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,960
Uranus didn't fit into the math some

36
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,180
planets like Jupiter seemed to be moving

37
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:38,400
faster in their orbits than in previous

38
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,409
observations and that couldn't be

39
00:01:40,409 --> 00:01:43,740
reflected in the math many began to

40
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:45,869
wonder if Newton's laws were not

41
00:01:45,869 --> 00:01:48,420
universal after all if there was a flaw

42
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:52,979
in the theory but not Orban Olivier

43
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:55,439
laverre ei was a French astronomer who

44
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:57,509
while not an excellent observer was an

45
00:01:57,509 --> 00:02:01,170
unparalleled mathematician in 1846 he

46
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:03,689
posited that Neptune had to exist based

47
00:02:03,689 --> 00:02:06,869
on the math of the orbit of Uranus Lavar

48
00:02:06,869 --> 00:02:08,970
EA wrote to an astronomer here in Berlin

49
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:11,370
johann gottfried gala with the predicted

50
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:12,240
coordinates

51
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:14,760
and the very same night gala observed

52
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:17,040
Neptune within one degree of where

53
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,540
levare had predicted it should be in

54
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:22,950
response to claims that Newton was wrong

55
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:25,590
he wrote if the tables do not strictly

56
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:27,900
agree with the observations we will

57
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:30,210
certainly not be tempted into charging

58
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:32,400
the law of universal gravitation with

59
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,490
inadequacy in other words even if some

60
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:37,650
observations don't match the math we

61
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:39,240
shouldn't immediately say the entire

62
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:42,060
theory is wrong in Lovera Hayes eyes

63
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:43,950
there was no need to toss out gravity

64
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:46,140
altogether just because there were some

65
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:48,930
gaps in our knowledge at the time no one

66
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:50,700
even knew how gravity worked even though

67
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:53,670
the math made sense variable Eve this

68
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:56,070
time passed we would improve upon our

69
00:02:56,070 --> 00:03:00,420
understanding over the past 20 years our

70
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:02,160
understanding of the world of front-end

71
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,360
development has changed

72
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,610
we've been iterating constantly on our

73
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:07,860
working theory of how to design and code

74
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:10,620
for the web it's fitting to talk about

75
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:12,750
this history at the tenth and last CSS

76
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:15,630
calm when CSS Zen garden came out in

77
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:18,810
2003 we were making web pages documents

78
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:21,570
the browser wars in the 90s had left us

79
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:24,150
with conflicting standards we

80
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:28,140
collectively fell in love with CSS and

81
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:30,000
then chain came jQuery and the

82
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,910
separation of concerns reusability with

83
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:34,980
CSS classes meant being able to change

84
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:37,740
our HTML without touching our CSS or

85
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:41,430
JavaScript as we began to build web apps

86
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:44,550
these complex interactive structures our

87
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:46,440
attention turned to tools that would

88
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:49,230
help us write more flexible code we

89
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:51,680
learned responsive web design sass

90
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,540
complex CSS architectures and new

91
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:57,780
JavaScript frameworks in the 2010s we

92
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:00,600
gained powerful tools like NPM web pack

93
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:03,840
and react on the design side we moved

94
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,060
from Photoshop to tools like sketch

95
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:09,200
abstract and figma they're slowly

96
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,000
narrowing the divide between design and

97
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,940
code we were looking for better tools

98
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:17,130
for reusability clarity and

99
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:20,880
maintainability we've used these tools

100
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,190
not just to create solutions to our

101
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:25,350
problems but also to create new to

102
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:27,660
fools these tools are changing the way

103
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:30,360
that we conceptualize our work we're

104
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,920
building on what we learned previously

105
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:34,560
and filling in the gaps and the unknowns

106
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:39,120
in the early 1850s levare was

107
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,130
calculating the orbits of every single

108
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:44,130
planet he intended to create a complete

109
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:45,900
set of tables that showed where the

110
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:48,030
planets would be in the sky at any given

111
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:48,680
time

112
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:51,660
first he mapped out the actual orbit of

113
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:52,290
the planet

114
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:54,510
based on calculations based on

115
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:58,050
observations next came calculations what

116
00:04:58,050 --> 00:04:59,700
de Newton's laws predict the orbits

117
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:02,970
should be and the observations and the

118
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:07,140
calculations should match Venus Earth

119
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:10,700
and Mars were all correct one though

120
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:19,180
obstinately refused to conform mercury

121
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:21,660
Mercury's orbit shifts forward

122
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:24,300
incrementally each time as the planet

123
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:26,610
wheels around the Sun its orbit makes

124
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:29,100
its own gradual orbit creating a flower

125
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:32,310
petal effect the shift is too large to

126
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:34,770
be explained only by the pull of Venus

127
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:37,740
and Earth's gravity z-- levar EI and his

128
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:40,500
book length report on Mercury wrote that

129
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,330
the likeliest solution was a planet

130
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:45,780
between mercury and the Sun providing an

131
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:49,350
additional gravitational pull he named

132
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:53,220
this possible planet Vulcan Vulcan would

133
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:55,470
orbit so close to the Sun you wouldn't

134
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:56,850
be able to see it in the daytime and

135
00:05:56,850 --> 00:05:59,250
like the Sun it wouldn't be in the sky

136
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:02,490
at night in the years after astronomers

137
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:06,570
all over the world observed Vulcan in

138
00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:10,260
July of 1878 a total eclipse crossed

139
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:13,230
America's West from Montana to Texas

140
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:15,420
because the Sun would be obscured

141
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:17,340
getting a clear observation of Vulcan

142
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:20,490
was the biggest prize during the Eclipse

143
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:22,950
an American astronomer using a small

144
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:25,530
telescope a set up of cardboard circles

145
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:28,830
in a sharp pencil plotted the transit of

146
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:32,970
an object as it moved across the Sun he

147
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:34,800
and many others believed it was Vulcan

148
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,560
the math worked out it fit neatly into

149
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,760
the explanation of

150
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:42,030
Curry's orbit but over time observations

151
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:44,610
of Vulcan dwindled and people begin to

152
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:47,670
doubt that it existed for years the

153
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:49,680
question of Mercury's orbit created

154
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,610
discord between astronomers we know now

155
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:55,890
that Vulcan doesn't exist but people

156
00:06:55,890 --> 00:06:58,290
kept discovering Vulcan because it fit

157
00:06:58,290 --> 00:06:59,840
into their understanding of the world

158
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,520
the limitations of their tools and

159
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04,950
knowledge at the time kept the answer

160
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:09,930
just out of reach as an industry we too

161
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:12,120
had a gap in our knowledge how do we

162
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:15,150
build firm maintainability and scale we

163
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:16,470
agreed that we're no longer building

164
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:19,380
pages we're building systems we agreed

165
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:20,790
that we need components that are

166
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:23,580
independent and reusable we agreed that

167
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:25,470
we need a single source of truth in code

168
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:29,810
for an easy authoring experience but how

169
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:32,400
based on our experience of the world

170
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,790
we tried varying solutions and tools for

171
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:38,910
some CSS tooling and methodologies for

172
00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:42,990
others javascript CSS and j/s new ideas

173
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:46,500
are often criticized and dismissed CSS

174
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,000
and JS was controversial

175
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,240
it still is putting our CSS back in our

176
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:53,550
HTML was rejecting that separation of

177
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:56,510
concerns that we had learned in the past

178
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:59,010
you might build components for a web app

179
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:01,290
with a JavaScript framework maybe you

180
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:03,150
work on a component library or design

181
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:05,910
system maybe you use functional CSS or

182
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:08,340
assess and BEM or styled components

183
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:11,070
maybe use plain CSS and vanilla

184
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:11,880
JavaScript

185
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:14,190
maybe you feel stuck with your legacy

186
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:16,530
codebase your cardboard circles and

187
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:19,770
sharp pencils we're heads down in our

188
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:22,620
work trying to find solutions we're not

189
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:23,960
always thinking about the big picture

190
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:27,540
and this causes conflict among us as we

191
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:29,250
struggle forward to a better

192
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:31,800
understanding but we're still working

193
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:36,570
towards the same core idea so what is

194
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:38,400
our working theory of a component and

195
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,530
how can we solve for the values of

196
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:43,670
consistency cohesion reusability

197
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:47,250
authoring maintainability how do we test

198
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:50,020
this theory with the tools that we have

199
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:54,100
today we know that a component needs to

200
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:57,220
be three things it's easy to reason

201
00:08:57,220 --> 00:09:01,360
about its if I context agnostic dry

202
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:11,320
independent and isolated first a

203
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,050
component must be easy to reason about

204
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:15,700
being easy to reason about isn't only

205
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:18,430
the amount of code or size or visual

206
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:20,680
complexity something that looks simple

207
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:23,380
can be deceptively complex and some

208
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:25,240
components that are hard to code are not

209
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:28,090
difficult to think about a component

210
00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:30,220
that has too many variants will be more

211
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:32,590
likely to have bugs will be hard to test

212
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:34,690
if all the variants work or when they

213
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:37,270
get used you might have too many props

214
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:40,030
and options or different styles for the

215
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:43,270
component in different contexts on the

216
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:45,280
other hand too few options mean a

217
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:47,440
component is pointless there's a spot

218
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,780
that's just right where the component is

219
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:52,630
used for one or a few cases with enough

220
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:56,890
options to make it flexible complexity

221
00:09:56,890 --> 00:09:59,440
in a component may come from design or

222
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,750
business requirements or it may build up

223
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:04,570
over time as developers add features or

224
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:07,120
designs change if your project is like

225
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,070
mine where many other teams use

226
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:11,710
components sometimes those teams needs

227
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:14,680
diverge at some point you may need to

228
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,540
split a component up into smaller pieces

229
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:19,090
that are easier to conceptualize if

230
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:20,860
there are common combinations you can

231
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:22,570
create shared parent components for

232
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:26,080
those four component libraries getting

233
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,880
other developers to use components

234
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:29,800
relies on their ability to understand

235
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:32,620
what the component is for often I see

236
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:34,390
developers say that they couldn't use a

237
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:36,070
component because it didn't offer the

238
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:38,380
right options that they needed sometimes

239
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:40,780
they're right but often they didn't

240
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:42,520
recognize the option was available a

241
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:44,680
component must have all of its options

242
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:47,290
and variants well documented in code

243
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:49,630
examples and tests so that's

244
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:53,200
discoverable and easy to understand so a

245
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,760
component that is easy to reason about

246
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:57,100
should be flexible enough to support its

247
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:59,410
use cases without being unwieldy or

248
00:10:59,410 --> 00:11:02,340
confusing

249
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:05,950
second a component is context agnostic

250
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:09,260
components promised us reusability we

251
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:11,240
want to take a button or card or comment

252
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:13,190
block and use it all over our projects

253
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:15,860
to be reusable a component must be

254
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:17,900
context agnostic meaning it shouldn't

255
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:20,150
need to know where it is to look or

256
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:24,860
behave properly to function properly and

257
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:27,230
consistently across contexts a component

258
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:28,670
should not have logic that controls

259
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:30,830
functionality outside of itself it

260
00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:33,170
should receive data down and send

261
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:36,710
actions up take for example a call to

262
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:39,080
action component it has a button when

263
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:41,750
the button is clicked a modal opens it

264
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:43,370
would be easy enough to write code that

265
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:46,070
pops a modal on click and that will work

266
00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:47,800
until we want some other functionality

267
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:50,090
so instead the buttons should just

268
00:11:50,090 --> 00:11:50,960
bubble up an event

269
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,960
I got clicked and the application can

270
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,160
determine what to do

271
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:58,940
when that event occurs styles for a

272
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:00,350
component should also have a single

273
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:02,510
source of truth whether you namespace

274
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:04,940
CSS with unique classes generate your

275
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:07,280
styles from JavaScript or use functional

276
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:09,470
CSS you know what belongs to the

277
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:11,660
component what does it and where to find

278
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:14,390
it don't rely on the markup structure

279
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:16,520
the contract between the parent markup

280
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:18,200
and the component to define the

281
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,690
component Styles the components should

282
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:22,130
have styles that are flexible enough

283
00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:23,780
that it can live anywhere in a

284
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:26,420
full-width parent in a sidebar or on its

285
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:28,790
own and you can let parent components

286
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:31,690
control the layout like widths or grid

287
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:34,610
if a component is supposed to look or

288
00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:36,770
behave differently in different context

289
00:12:36,770 --> 00:12:38,750
make sure the logic behind those changes

290
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:41,360
is well-defined it's possible the

291
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,490
component needs to be split into two or

292
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:45,500
sometimes the best solution is not a

293
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,420
shared component at all but implementing

294
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:51,050
that feature as a one-off so a component

295
00:12:51,050 --> 00:12:52,760
that is context agnostic will be

296
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:59,730
reusable and flexible

297
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:02,600
third a component is independent and

298
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:05,780
isolated to be context agnostic a

299
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:07,460
component must be independent and

300
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:10,340
isolated but isolation of functionality

301
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:12,320
and style gives us more than just the

302
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,240
flexibility to use a component anywhere

303
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:17,210
an independent component should have

304
00:13:17,210 --> 00:13:19,280
good defaults like default text

305
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:21,440
accessibility settings and empty states

306
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,780
it should just work straight out of the

307
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:26,450
box this means it needs to import all of

308
00:13:26,450 --> 00:13:28,580
its own dependencies we're familiar with

309
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:30,740
this pattern and JavaScript importing

310
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:33,380
packages as needed and this gives you

311
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:35,480
confidence in what is there and makes it

312
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:37,640
easy to test whether or not an imported

313
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:41,840
file is actually used a component being

314
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,520
independent and isolated means it will

315
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:45,490
look correct in an isolated environment

316
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:48,470
it cannot rely on the presence of styles

317
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:51,010
from a parent container or a global page

318
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:53,720
completely isolated components means you

319
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,430
also have the ability to test with

320
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:57,470
confidence you can generate each

321
00:13:57,470 --> 00:13:59,810
component into its own page by itself

322
00:13:59,810 --> 00:14:03,100
and run visual regression and unit tests

323
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:05,270
isolation for testing means that your

324
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:07,550
component tests only itself and doesn't

325
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:09,410
rely on other page functionality to work

326
00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:12,290
properly we know then that any bugs we

327
00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:14,660
catch in that isolated environment or in

328
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:16,700
the component and bugs elsewhere are

329
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:18,680
byproducts of how the application and

330
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:22,070
the components interact and this makes

331
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:24,250
us confident in the components quality

332
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:26,450
developers should trust that components

333
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:28,220
won't break their pages and it also

334
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:29,660
means we don't have to hobble the

335
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,670
creativity of our designers for the sake

336
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:34,760
of code predictability if you have

337
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:36,610
components that are understandable

338
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:39,380
independent and can live in any context

339
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:41,420
you can now use other components by

340
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:44,210
composition a component can import or

341
00:14:44,210 --> 00:14:45,890
reference another component in its

342
00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:48,680
markup it may make style tweaks past

343
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:51,590
props and change options data can be

344
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:54,110
changed in child components and events

345
00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:57,620
and state passed backup and so this is

346
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:59,720
our current theory about the world of

347
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:06,400
modern web development

348
00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:09,000
using the tools they had and what they

349
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,710
observed and the knowledge they had

350
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:12,750
Vulcan was the best explanation

351
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:14,940
astronomers in the 1800's had for

352
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:17,100
Mercury's orbit and it would take almost

353
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:19,950
60 years to add new information to the

354
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:24,450
theory it's 1913 and Einstein is working

355
00:15:24,450 --> 00:15:27,060
on his theory of general relativity he

356
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:29,130
does a calculation to see what his math

357
00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:32,190
predicts for the orbit of mercury and it

358
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:36,270
fits the core concept of general

359
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:38,520
relativity is that space and time can be

360
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:41,370
changed by the presence of matter a vast

361
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:44,700
mass like the Sun distorts space-time so

362
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:46,950
Mercury's orbit shifts because that's

363
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:48,540
the path that has to take through the

364
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:51,420
curved space-time around the Sun without

365
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:53,370
curved space-time you need some other

366
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:56,340
objects gravity to pull on Rectory with

367
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:58,770
curved space-time mercury is observed

368
00:15:58,770 --> 00:16:02,250
orbit makes sense but Hine Stein didn't

369
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:04,050
disprove Newton's law of universal

370
00:16:04,050 --> 00:16:07,290
gravitation gravity still exists the

371
00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:09,420
tables of planetary orbits that lavera a

372
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:11,310
calculated in the 1850s are still

373
00:16:11,310 --> 00:16:11,870
accurate

374
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:14,250
general relativity updated our

375
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:17,040
understanding of the world it filled in

376
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,470
some gaps gave us better measurements

377
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:22,050
and strengthened the theory that came

378
00:16:22,050 --> 00:16:25,620
before many astronomers worked as

379
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:28,290
observers they saw and recorded how the

380
00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:31,110
world really was others like the very a

381
00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:33,470
and Einstein worked as mathematicians

382
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:36,120
pushing at the edges of our theoretical

383
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:39,360
knowledge and you get to do both you

384
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,130
might not feel like you can innovate if

385
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:43,230
you work for a big company or on an old

386
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:45,780
tech stack but the majority of us don't

387
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:48,090
get to use all the new cool technologies

388
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:50,430
I've worked on this theory of components

389
00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:52,950
and everything from PHP and sass to

390
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:55,680
react and even plain CSS for Java

391
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,560
templates

392
00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:00,120
even without the newest tools we are

393
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:03,150
applying this theory to our work your

394
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:04,940
project has limitations and constraints

395
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:07,980
the laws of the world we know what we

396
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:11,220
want components to be our theory so as

397
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:13,320
you write code how do you know if your

398
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:17,190
component fulfills the theory your

399
00:17:17,190 --> 00:17:18,720
particular application of this

400
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,159
theory will depend on your particular

401
00:17:20,159 --> 00:17:21,990
projects requirements and technical

402
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:24,600
constraints and indeed my team put

403
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:26,250
together a checklist that lives in our

404
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:28,020
projects contributing Docs and that

405
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:30,020
describes how we build components

406
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:31,950
defining what a component should be

407
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:33,990
gives you a tactical way to test your

408
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:37,169
results in the theory it outlines the

409
00:17:37,169 --> 00:17:39,030
three high-level concepts I spoke about

410
00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:42,059
being easy to reason about being context

411
00:17:42,059 --> 00:17:43,919
diagnostic and being independent and

412
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:46,620
isolated but it also contains a much

413
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:48,630
more concrete list of what a component

414
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:52,830
must do here's some examples to be easy

415
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:54,929
to reason about a component must have

416
00:17:54,929 --> 00:17:56,940
written design and usage documentation

417
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:59,549
as well as code comments for all props

418
00:17:59,549 --> 00:18:02,970
options and variants it must have unit

419
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:04,860
and visual tests so we can make and

420
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:07,440
verify changes safely and it should have

421
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,480
limited variants that fulfill real use

422
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:11,820
cases with examples of how and when to

423
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:17,190
use them to be context diagnostic a

424
00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:19,260
component must work in all supported

425
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:21,659
browsers and devices including touch

426
00:18:21,659 --> 00:18:24,990
mouse keyboard and assistive devices it

427
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:27,210
should meet accessibility standards and

428
00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:29,370
it should look and function correctly in

429
00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:31,230
both left to right and right to left

430
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:34,020
languages it should have no external

431
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:36,419
layout properties like grid float or

432
00:18:36,419 --> 00:18:38,250
even margins that would keep it from

433
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:40,559
being used in a variety of contexts and

434
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:43,169
it should receive data down from the

435
00:18:43,169 --> 00:18:48,240
parent or page and bubble actions up to

436
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,400
ensure a component is independent and

437
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,740
isolated it must work in an isolated

438
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:55,530
environment it must define or import all

439
00:18:55,530 --> 00:18:57,299
of its own dependencies including

440
00:18:57,299 --> 00:18:59,700
JavaScript and styles and it should

441
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:01,679
define the component namespace or a key

442
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:05,220
selector only one time in one place it

443
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:06,720
should have appropriate default text

444
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,840
empty states and error States and it

445
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,970
should only affect itself and not rely

446
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:14,130
on other components or the page for

447
00:19:14,130 --> 00:19:18,150
functionality this checklist makes it

448
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:19,620
easier for anyone who works on

449
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:21,240
components to do the right thing

450
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:23,760
with a checklist as a reference we can

451
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,080
be sure we've done everything necessary

452
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,299
to make a component that will work as

453
00:19:27,299 --> 00:19:29,520
expected and be a valuable part of our

454
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:32,250
library we keep the theory

455
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:34,440
and promise of modern web development

456
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,960
close at hand and our everyday work as

457
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,480
we build code tests and try new

458
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,550
technologies we are observing how the

459
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:43,770
theory works and improving our

460
00:19:43,770 --> 00:19:49,670
understanding

461
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:51,780
[Applause]

462
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:54,400
after formulating the theory of general

463
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,740
relativity Einstein pondered what would

464
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:59,560
happen when a huge object in space was

465
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:02,670
disturbed like two black holes colliding

466
00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:05,770
he predicted that a cosmic event that

467
00:20:05,770 --> 00:20:07,660
this disturbs the fabric of space-time

468
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:10,600
with enough force should produce ripples

469
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:15,220
in gravity scientists didn't agree many

470
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:16,780
believed that these ripples were just

471
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:19,150
artifacts of the new mass that somewhere

472
00:20:19,150 --> 00:20:22,270
the calculations were wrong even if the

473
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:24,520
ripples were real they would be so small

474
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:26,890
by the time they got to us we wouldn't

475
00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:28,990
be able to detect them anyway at the

476
00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:30,850
time many scientists didn't even believe

477
00:20:30,850 --> 00:20:32,490
black holes were real

478
00:20:32,490 --> 00:20:36,220
this theory explained many things but it

479
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:40,480
also opened up new questions over the

480
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,340
last half-century there has been an

481
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:44,680
experimental quest to detect these

482
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,540
gravitational ripples that Einstein

483
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:49,000
predicted an international team of

484
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,820
scientists has built a pair of colossal

485
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:54,760
gravity wave detectors called LIGO to

486
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:57,820
try and detect these ripples LIGO the

487
00:20:57,820 --> 00:20:59,400
laser interferometer gravitational-wave

488
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:02,980
Observatory took 50 years to build and

489
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:05,620
cost millions of dollars and the LIGO

490
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:07,180
teams weren't even sure they would

491
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:10,000
detect anything when it was done people

492
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,540
questioned doubted mocks them yet the

493
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:15,640
legal team is persistent because it is

494
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:17,560
crucial to think beyond today's

495
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:21,190
understanding of the world out in deep

496
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:25,030
space 1.3 billion years ago two black

497
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:27,250
holes circle each other churning up

498
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:29,260
space and time until they crash and

499
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:32,020
merge into one enormous black hole an

500
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:34,030
event outputting more than a trillion

501
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:37,950
times the power of a billion suns the

502
00:21:37,950 --> 00:21:41,710
black holes collide in complete darkness

503
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:44,050
none of the energy exploding from the

504
00:21:44,050 --> 00:21:47,200
collision comes out as light that energy

505
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,570
emanates as waves in the shape of

506
00:21:49,570 --> 00:21:54,040
space-time as ripples in gravity an

507
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:56,470
astronaut floating nearby would see

508
00:21:56,470 --> 00:21:59,590
nothing but the space around her would

509
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:00,730
ring

510
00:22:00,730 --> 00:22:03,700
when black holes collide they make us

511
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:09,790
sound in December of 2015 almost exactly

512
00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:12,130
a hundred years after Einstein presented

513
00:22:12,130 --> 00:22:14,830
general relativity LIGO detected that

514
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:17,590
collision we heard two black holes

515
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:20,620
collide ligo's discovery verified

516
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:23,200
general relativity as fact and changed

517
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,880
the way that scientists understand the

518
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:25,710
universe

519
00:22:25,710 --> 00:22:28,390
LIGO not only changed our working

520
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:30,460
knowledge of the world they accomplished

521
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:31,870
one of the greatest feats of modern

522
00:22:31,870 --> 00:22:35,110
science and yet again we have new

523
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:39,610
questions to ponder our work may not

524
00:22:39,610 --> 00:22:41,740
seem so grand what could be grander than

525
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:45,670
black holes planets celestial motion but

526
00:22:45,670 --> 00:22:47,920
even firmly planted in our earthly work

527
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:50,250
we too can think like scientists

528
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:53,070
continually working to expand our theory

529
00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:57,640
confirm it and strengthen it we build

530
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:59,670
new applications try new technologies

531
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:02,350
give conference talks create libraries

532
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:05,140
and design systems we are observing and

533
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:08,560
calculating what we learn will add to

534
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:10,780
our Theory help us create even better

535
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:13,600
tools and propel us forward into a new

536
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,570
world so as we work together today and

537
00:23:16,570 --> 00:23:18,550
tomorrow and in the months and years to

538
00:23:18,550 --> 00:23:20,980
come keep thinking beyond today's

539
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:24,670
understanding and on to tomorrow's thank

540
00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:25,720
you
