00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:19,160

hello I'm actually a rubios and this

2
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:21,110
quite loud and a JavaScript developer

3
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:23,890
portrayed so CSS is kind of like a

4
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:27,470
necessity for me and so this talk is had

5
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:30,289
a sneak JavaScript into a CSS comp I'm

6
00:00:30,289 --> 00:00:31,760
going if you're walking tour of how

7
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,590
folks USS works and I'm going to teach

8
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:36,020
you how I can into how integrated it to

9
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:38,150
an e-commerce platform to convert that

10
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:40,790
platform from English to Arabic so I try

11
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:42,290
to hold on to things and I was trying to

12
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:44,030
make it fail because I wanted this to be

13
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:45,199
a story of agony because they're way

14
00:00:45,199 --> 00:00:47,420
more fun to watch I find tragedies the

15
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:51,170
best for this story okay so about me I

16
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:55,070
do a mean Ron Swanson impression my name

17
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:57,379
is Lachlan priest I go by at LC priests

18
00:00:57,379 --> 00:00:59,330
pretty much everywhere there are two

19
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:01,460
Lachlan fries on this planet one's a 16

20
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:03,650
year 16 Australian and he stole my

21
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:06,620
twitter handle he followed Justin Bieber

22
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:08,930
and then stopped using Twitter so I'm

23
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:11,180
just gonna give it to him and you won

24
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:16,130
this one dick yeah so most the time if

25
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:18,110
I'm working on Ruby on Rails and images

26
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:20,960
so I always here so is Ruby Jade yet is

27
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,810
in bj's dead yet I'm like not just go

28
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:28,460
back to my work now so this is what I

29
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:29,990
work on a specially closed source but I

30
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:31,670
try and contribute one thing a week back

31
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:35,540
to open source generally in systems or

32
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:36,890
integrations that I'm working with like

33
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:40,160
closely not really sure why Thomas let

34
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:43,100
me speak to the CSS comp but let's go so

35
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:44,690
I went for trade gecko that's this group

36
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:46,970
up front they're my co-workers and I

37
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:50,420
Boston to laugh for me so just use their

38
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:53,570
cue um so this little guy he's moco I

39
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:55,100
have stickers if you want some stickers

40
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:57,050
he was invented by our design team and

41
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:58,490
he is the embodiment of our company

42
00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:01,870
thats is a James Bond theme I think

43
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:05,090
shakin what's dead my official job title

44
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:08,750
is the most huggable engineer okay so

45
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:14,750
post ESS uh it is who knows it sounded

46
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:16,879
cool and I wanted to remove sass from a

47
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:17,989
JavaScript object we're working on

48
00:02:17,989 --> 00:02:21,260
because we have one main API and I was

49
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:23,329
building an e-commerce platform that use

50
00:02:23,329 --> 00:02:24,769
that API but didn't need to have any

51
00:02:24,769 --> 00:02:25,160
back in

52
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,110
services so I didn't want a lib SAS

53
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:29,210
dependency so I just had to use post CSS

54
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:32,930
so what is it I'm no idea well I had no

55
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:35,330
idea whenever I do a blog or a talk I

56
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:36,440
like to pick something I've never

57
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,930
touched before and learn about it so

58
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:40,670
that's what I did how do you learn about

59
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:44,510
things go to github great this tells me

60
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:46,940
nothing it is a tool for transforming

61
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:49,040
styles with jes plugins that means

62
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:53,090
nothing to me okay but if you look down

63
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:54,650
further it's talking about how post CSS

64
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:56,630
passes CSS and lets you do other things

65
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:59,450
so it does nothing by itself but with

66
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:02,240
other things you can do magic okay so

67
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:05,060
when I started this this talk I had a

68
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:07,910
hypothesis that I would fail at this and

69
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:09,320
would be a great story of me failing

70
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:13,940
something anyway and the point I wanted

71
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:15,350
to make was that it's more important to

72
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:17,000
do your job than to play with new

73
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,500
technologies being with ruby on rails in

74
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,600
in bjs everyone asked me why we haven't

75
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,040
moved to go or some new fancy language

76
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:24,470
that is great we didn't move because

77
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:26,120
there's a lot of effort and I want to do

78
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:29,660
features so now with Paula CSS I wanted

79
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:32,300
to find out what I can use it for okay

80
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:34,640
so I'll take an input file this is some

81
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:38,750
CSS as you can see and store / CSS and

82
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:41,570
run it I had to include this plug-in on

83
00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:44,540
the far right which I wrote because you

84
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:46,550
can't even run / CSS without a plugin it

85
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:48,650
does nothing don't worry this is the

86
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:52,190
output it's exactly the same what does

87
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:55,340
Posey assistive it's not a preprocessor

88
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:57,140
the main thing you hear when you talk

89
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:58,820
about posea says is that it's not sass

90
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:00,890
it's not less it doesn't do any of those

91
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:04,160
things but it can it's just a passer and

92
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,350
it passes your CSS into a series of

93
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:08,870
notes so the nodes go like this there's

94
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:11,300
a root node that is your entire fifth

95
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:14,180
his file there are rules those are divs

96
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:16,640
whatever all the elements classes and

97
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:19,609
ID's there are declarations which are

98
00:04:19,609 --> 00:04:23,060
like color and this color is really

99
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:24,470
important it is gecko green like the

100
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:27,740
t-shirts and just a nice font and then

101
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:29,480
there are comments so you can track all

102
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,190
of those things using Pro CSS and then

103
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:34,850
perform operations on those things post

104
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:36,979
CSS provides a nice little API to that

105
00:04:36,979 --> 00:04:38,520
is provided to all plugin

106
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:41,879
we were past an object called container

107
00:04:41,879 --> 00:04:45,599
and that can that object has a variety

108
00:04:45,599 --> 00:04:48,270
of functions the functions are walk

109
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:49,830
declarations walk rules and what

110
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:52,409
comments they're essentially a for each

111
00:04:52,409 --> 00:04:54,900
I don't know why they call it that for

112
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:57,030
those specific things now if we go back

113
00:04:57,030 --> 00:05:01,409
to those things a declaration is a CSS

114
00:05:01,409 --> 00:05:04,229
property a rule is a different class and

115
00:05:04,229 --> 00:05:07,110
comment is a comment obviously so the

116
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:09,470
API comes with little plugins and

117
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:11,610
because it's just an API and does

118
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:13,440
nothing the community provided

119
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,750
everything else here's a list of some of

120
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:21,300
the plugins there's like 200 of them so

121
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:24,599
I'll go over the first bit again i think

122
00:05:24,599 --> 00:05:26,460
i just talked about this the main point

123
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:28,889
is that it's not a preprocessor it's not

124
00:05:28,889 --> 00:05:31,110
really anything but there is a

125
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:33,810
preprocessor processor plugin so pre CSS

126
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:35,340
provides you everything that SAS

127
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:37,669
provides you but with just a JavaScript

128
00:05:37,669 --> 00:05:42,330
so in my day job I have this this is an

129
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:44,490
e-commerce platform it has like 10

130
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:46,020
different pages it's very small very

131
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:48,930
easy to use and it's got demo data about

132
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:51,000
Willy Wonka I don't know why it's always

133
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,139
been in our production that's always

134
00:05:52,139 --> 00:05:54,900
going to stay so I want to replace ass

135
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:57,539
with row CSS so i did that i installed

136
00:05:57,539 --> 00:05:59,880
post ESS apparently the normal library

137
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,440
is broken so there's a fixed one and

138
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,599
then i installed pre CSS which is the

139
00:06:03,599 --> 00:06:07,050
SAS drop-in replacement nothing changed

140
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:11,909
again so at this point I kind of had

141
00:06:11,909 --> 00:06:13,380
like a draft email to Thomas being like

142
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:15,300
this isn't working I was trying to be

143
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:17,610
funny nothing's breaking it just works I

144
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:19,650
had away how do I make this story about

145
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:21,599
posties his failing means sticking with

146
00:06:21,599 --> 00:06:24,900
the status quo work so i decided to try

147
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:28,430
and break it it's pretty hard actually

148
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:31,770
so what do I do now let's translate the

149
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:33,630
website so anyone that works with me

150
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:35,819
knows that my main contributor can check

151
00:06:35,819 --> 00:06:38,039
our contribution to github is in all the

152
00:06:38,039 --> 00:06:39,719
qas I'll call out all of the files you

153
00:06:39,719 --> 00:06:42,210
haven't translated and just what i 18 n

154
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:44,370
or internationalisation like hundreds of

155
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:46,620
times everywhere all the time it's the

156
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:50,070
most annoying thing but it helps so even

157
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:51,509
with my admittedly very aggressive

158
00:06:51,509 --> 00:06:52,009
stance

159
00:06:52,009 --> 00:06:53,900
I've never actually translated a project

160
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:56,599
I've just made it possible so how was /

161
00:06:56,599 --> 00:07:00,020
CSS useful here it's not really so and

162
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:02,629
here comes ma this is my he's my co

163
00:07:02,629 --> 00:07:07,159
worker that works on slack by the way

164
00:07:07,159 --> 00:07:09,439
you can use gifts and it's amazing what

165
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:13,610
happens okay so mo and I we run a meetup

166
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:15,499
called Ruby tea party where we teach you

167
00:07:15,499 --> 00:07:17,119
what Ruby because there aren't enough in

168
00:07:17,119 --> 00:07:19,610
the community and I love Ruby this is

169
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:21,080
really important to me because I taught

170
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:23,599
myself the code and the community really

171
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:25,009
helped me with that so I wanted to give

172
00:07:25,009 --> 00:07:27,740
back so Mohamed and I always talk about

173
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:29,979
startups on what we could do and how

174
00:07:29,979 --> 00:07:32,479
sorry Mohammed's from Syria speaks

175
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:34,639
Arabic and we're discussing how no one

176
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:36,349
really caters towards the Arabic market

177
00:07:36,349 --> 00:07:38,149
so wouldn't it be cool if we could build

178
00:07:38,149 --> 00:07:40,339
a project that works for them so first

179
00:07:40,339 --> 00:07:41,719
of all I wanted to try it in our own

180
00:07:41,719 --> 00:07:43,339
projects because I don't really have any

181
00:07:43,339 --> 00:07:45,139
side projects worth marketing right now

182
00:07:45,139 --> 00:07:48,999
or ever i don't know i'm not very busy

183
00:07:48,999 --> 00:07:51,289
so if you want to come to the tea party

184
00:07:51,289 --> 00:07:52,909
by the way it's every thursday come talk

185
00:07:52,909 --> 00:07:54,469
to me we have great offices in this free

186
00:07:54,469 --> 00:07:59,089
food so the way we can work with arabic

187
00:07:59,089 --> 00:08:00,229
is that there are two things yet to do

188
00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:02,270
one is translate the project and the

189
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:03,800
second has changed at X direction and

190
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:06,349
even the flow of the app so there is a

191
00:08:06,349 --> 00:08:08,779
plugin for Posey SS surprise that does

192
00:08:08,779 --> 00:08:11,180
this this is an example of github if you

193
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:13,789
reverse it they've still got an English

194
00:08:13,789 --> 00:08:15,409
I don't know why but this is the point

195
00:08:15,409 --> 00:08:17,559
this is mohammed a different mohammed

196
00:08:17,559 --> 00:08:19,789
that I reached out to an almost offered

197
00:08:19,789 --> 00:08:22,249
a job too but he was in Jordan and

198
00:08:22,249 --> 00:08:25,879
didn't leave any you need to make sure

199
00:08:25,879 --> 00:08:29,300
that your site not just is in Arabic but

200
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:31,610
feels native to an Arabic speaker so the

201
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:33,500
way this plugin works is that it takes

202
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,680
your CSS this is the top and the bottom

203
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:38,360
and all it really does is it finds all

204
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,550
lefts and rights and equivalent things

205
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:43,490
and switches them so if you run the plug

206
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:45,829
in your position relative left hand

207
00:08:45,829 --> 00:08:47,360
picks becomes right Tim picks and it

208
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,010
just works because every time you

209
00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:51,290
reference aside like float left position

210
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:53,690
left texture issue a direction left to

211
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:55,670
right all year to do is reverse it and

212
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:57,170
then suddenly it works because the

213
00:08:57,170 --> 00:08:58,550
browser was just this way there's no up

214
00:08:58,550 --> 00:09:00,130
and down there's no rotation great

215
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:02,959
obviously before you can translate so

216
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,259
I'm going to slow down going for

217
00:09:04,259 --> 00:09:06,600
just obviously before you can translate

218
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,699
is a bunch of manual work like putting

219
00:09:08,699 --> 00:09:10,589
all your strings in your app into one

220
00:09:10,589 --> 00:09:12,629
file so this is all of the texts i think

221
00:09:12,629 --> 00:09:14,669
it's another like 500 lines in that

222
00:09:14,669 --> 00:09:16,619
e-commerce store it's only like nine

223
00:09:16,619 --> 00:09:19,739
hundred words and i had to get it

224
00:09:19,739 --> 00:09:21,299
translated obviously i could have asked

225
00:09:21,299 --> 00:09:23,160
mohammed but he's got stuff to do so i

226
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,289
found a service the same way that i

227
00:09:25,289 --> 00:09:26,850
always find something new if I want to

228
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:28,019
learn a new technology you'll see how

229
00:09:28,019 --> 00:09:30,089
best practices it is I go check out

230
00:09:30,089 --> 00:09:34,470
discourse discourse is a images and

231
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:36,479
rails app it's much bigger than ours in

232
00:09:36,479 --> 00:09:37,979
its open source so it's always a good

233
00:09:37,979 --> 00:09:40,379
spot to work on like scaling problems or

234
00:09:40,379 --> 00:09:42,029
learn new things so the way they

235
00:09:42,029 --> 00:09:44,579
translate it I think it's in like 60

236
00:09:44,579 --> 00:09:46,470
languages now the way they translated it

237
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:48,239
is with this project called transifex

238
00:09:48,239 --> 00:09:49,949
you just throw your strings in there and

239
00:09:49,949 --> 00:09:51,479
you can translate it as a group or you

240
00:09:51,479 --> 00:09:53,429
can pay someone I obviously didn't have

241
00:09:53,429 --> 00:09:55,169
a group so I found someone to pay and it

242
00:09:55,169 --> 00:09:57,629
was like 130 dollars the translate to

243
00:09:57,629 --> 00:10:00,269
Arabic incredibly cheap didn't wanna pay

244
00:10:00,269 --> 00:10:02,789
myself so I convinced my boss but so

245
00:10:02,789 --> 00:10:04,139
here are the numbers to commit your bust

246
00:10:04,139 --> 00:10:05,759
by the way there are 19 countries that

247
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:07,949
speak Arabic natively 280 million eight

248
00:10:07,949 --> 00:10:10,709
is needed Arabic speakers five percent

249
00:10:10,709 --> 00:10:12,239
of our customers are from arabic arabic

250
00:10:12,239 --> 00:10:14,519
countries and for naps in the world

251
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:16,739
speaks over in Italy natively so why are

252
00:10:16,739 --> 00:10:19,529
these customers using our product at

253
00:10:19,529 --> 00:10:21,329
that ratio which is higher than the

254
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:23,639
standard if there is something available

255
00:10:23,639 --> 00:10:25,379
for the Arab market turns out there

256
00:10:25,379 --> 00:10:27,359
isn't if you look so my company does

257
00:10:27,359 --> 00:10:29,339
inventory management software if you

258
00:10:29,339 --> 00:10:30,509
look up English inventory management

259
00:10:30,509 --> 00:10:31,919
software you get seven million results

260
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:34,649
in English half million in Arabic and if

261
00:10:34,649 --> 00:10:37,529
you actually use average tank text you

262
00:10:37,529 --> 00:10:41,639
get even less so 123 dollars and 36

263
00:10:41,639 --> 00:10:44,730
hours later my site was in Arabic super

264
00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:50,459
easy there we go whoops 12 mini now it's

265
00:10:50,459 --> 00:10:52,769
an Arabic obviously I didn't translate

266
00:10:52,769 --> 00:10:54,659
the dynamic data I probably could have

267
00:10:54,659 --> 00:10:56,939
given you example data for that but all

268
00:10:56,939 --> 00:10:59,279
of the layout is and it looks pretty

269
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:01,049
nice actually so this is where

270
00:11:01,049 --> 00:11:02,729
right-to-left CSS comes in I had to

271
00:11:02,729 --> 00:11:07,859
reverse the UI direction in order to you

272
00:11:07,859 --> 00:11:09,149
know make it more comfortable for Arabic

273
00:11:09,149 --> 00:11:11,519
speakers so rad clear CSS comes along

274
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:13,980
runs it over my files and it's not

275
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:15,990
perfect

276
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:19,060
in fact it breaks quite a lot in random

277
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:20,670
places but that's actually a case of

278
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:24,250
first of type last child etc when you're

279
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:26,710
trying to do border radiuses and a few

280
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:28,630
other things and it just doesn't work

281
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:30,550
perfectly but a little bit of hand with

282
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:33,400
your magic layer and it looks great so

283
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,950
everything is aligned I may have just

284
00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:39,850
used developer tools for this but so

285
00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:44,200
telia / CSS does nothing but it provides

286
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,450
an API for us to do everything like if

287
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:47,830
we go back to those previous slides I'm

288
00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:48,940
not going to jump in so it's like 30

289
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:52,000
back there are approximately 200

290
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,040
different plugins available ones that do

291
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:58,760
like color blindness to usability

292
00:11:58,770 --> 00:12:00,780
obviously i think is a translation one

293
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:04,870
minification CSS next is this for BAM

294
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:06,190
linting that's really important five

295
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:09,220
teams are trying to move to bem just a

296
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:11,290
million of them one of them CSS format

297
00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:13,330
that all is great I ran at once and I

298
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:14,500
think in committed four thousand lines

299
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:17,050
of CSS to github because it tied

300
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:20,290
everything up great so Perseus does

301
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:24,970
nothing it's just an API but it allows

302
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:28,570
for a awesome ecosystem to form and one

303
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:29,740
of the things I love about it is it

304
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:31,090
allows people to stop arguing about

305
00:12:31,090 --> 00:12:33,460
Seth's like capabilities because they

306
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:34,510
don't want Ruby could dependencies in

307
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:38,260
the jas projects I love sass it's great

308
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:39,250
I want to stick with it as long as

309
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:42,490
possible but if I can get all of the

310
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:45,190
functionality SS without using Ruby or

311
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:47,230
lips s or whatever it's great I would

312
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:49,180
love to do that because in bridge is

313
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:50,440
great and I never want to touch Ruby

314
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:53,890
when I'm touching Ember anyway ok so I

315
00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:56,850
think I've gone a little bit too fast

316
00:12:56,850 --> 00:13:01,170
that was my second to last slides I

317
00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:03,430
don't know why this video came out but

318
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:05,650
it came with so many cool gifts this guy

319
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:09,250
is amazing sidenote internationalisation

320
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:10,720
gets really addictive here it is in

321
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:15,580
Spanish um that took me another 36 hours

322
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:17,980
at one hundred twenty dollars as you can

323
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:20,470
see it's super easy let's go more into

324
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:22,660
my CSS I can do this for hours so the

325
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:25,960
community is super weird one of the

326
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:28,360
things that I as a new zealand I just

327
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,120
like about si si

328
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,430
that's in American English someone fixed

329
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:33,320
that you can now write your CSS as if

330
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,790
you're British what the you with

331
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:37,040
transparency with sintel as its to be

332
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,800
spelled and it just translates just

333
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:42,620
compile sorry to the right version our

334
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:44,330
very own Sebastian deckers who's

335
00:13:44,330 --> 00:13:47,120
actually teaching across the road he put

336
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:50,470
this one which is amazing so you can use

337
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:52,910
nonsense units in his fiercest and it

338
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:56,210
just works that joke there is 20,000

339
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:59,779
Leagues Under the Sea so my contribution

340
00:13:59,779 --> 00:14:02,540
was a post English post ESS English

341
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:04,550
style sheets I had to get a co-worker to

342
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:05,810
check this to make sure I wasn't insane

343
00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:08,540
Thank You jing-mei um it was really hard

344
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:10,100
to find a lot of things I ended up just

345
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:14,150
doing colors this entire thing was built

346
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:17,480
in like twelve lines of JavaScript so

347
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:18,890
that's just doing the warp declarations

348
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:20,510
and then you can just go over each them

349
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:24,800
and it just gripped um I did the ice

350
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,480
kacang is my favorite it does the the

351
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,300
gradient and it's beautiful I don't I

352
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:30,470
guess foreigners wouldn't understand

353
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:33,650
that one but anyway that's great man I'm

354
00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:36,080
way and time sorry I shoulda spoke and

355
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:39,470
slow okay so you want to learn more

356
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:41,180
check out discourse discourse is an

357
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:43,959
awesome resource for learning rails

358
00:14:43,959 --> 00:14:47,779
umber scaling just anything transifex

359
00:14:47,779 --> 00:14:50,060
was the translation software that took

360
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:53,390
me maybe 20 minutes to master the U is

361
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:55,180
not amazing but they're getting there

362
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:58,760
obviously pro CSS is available and if

363
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:00,410
you didn't actually listen to me there's

364
00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:02,930
another video of a guy who wrote OH CSS

365
00:15:02,930 --> 00:15:07,690
Heaney's available to this is pushing

366
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:11,270
he's a ginger with a mustache like me um

367
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:13,760
I couldn't find a top hat in the monocle

368
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:17,150
but I tried pretty hard sorry I went

369
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:18,790
away under time doing any questions

370
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:21,800
excuse gone when you were playing around

371
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:24,770
with post CSS apart from dodgy

372
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:26,900
translations and things like that did

373
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:29,330
you find any plugins they're quite

374
00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:31,700
useful or do you not really use it at

375
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:33,740
the moment I actually I dropped it into

376
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:36,230
I'm a nap and replace s like it was I

377
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:38,120
did everything I needed to do I was just

378
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,829
surprised it work so easily like I

379
00:15:39,829 --> 00:15:41,240
wanted to be like its Tara

380
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,500
don't use it but it just worked

381
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:45,140
perfectly so at the moment I'm using CSS

382
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:46,550
and nano which is a mentor fire i'm

383
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:49,339
using scissors next so i can try and

384
00:15:49,339 --> 00:15:50,690
drop variables and use the standard one

385
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:53,899
that's coming out with CSS for either of

386
00:15:53,899 --> 00:15:55,370
them I don't think this is this for

387
00:15:55,370 --> 00:15:57,589
think it's called CSS next and we're

388
00:15:57,589 --> 00:16:01,160
also using pre CSS to replace s

389
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:03,020
obviously and i'm probably going to put

390
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:04,790
in beam lint in the future because

391
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:08,560
brooke my main front end co-worker is

392
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:12,350
trying to get us a switch it works

393
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:14,870
really well i also i wanted to do one

394
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:16,130
for color blindness because our company

395
00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:18,350
uses way too many like greys and I want

396
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:20,959
to like demonstrate that to out like

397
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:25,040
exec team yeah I was just wondering like

398
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,770
you were saying pre CSS what's very well

399
00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:31,100
if you convert from SAS to Paul CSS I

400
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:33,260
was just wondering if you use like

401
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:37,100
multiple libraries or obsess mix-ins was

402
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:43,580
it like things up so pre CSS is a

403
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:46,310
set of smaller / CSS libraries that give

404
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:47,800
you all of those functionalities are

405
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:50,120
posted says at rules which is the main

406
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:55,490
sets mix in tool and then post ESS

407
00:16:55,490 --> 00:17:00,350
nested and process variable so

408
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:01,700
appreciate this is actually just a

409
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:03,560
package of plugins so it gives you all

410
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:04,880
of the different things that sass users

411
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,220
and I think they maintain it to be

412
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:09,770
that's compatible I don't know there's a
