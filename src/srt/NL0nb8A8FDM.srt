1
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:12,389

hey everyone how's it goin uh yeah I'm

2
00:00:12,389 --> 00:00:14,940
Matt and I'm from New Zealand as you

3
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:18,500
probably didn't know from my accent is

4
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:21,060
anyone here from New Zealand by any

5
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:25,590
chance yes excellent I was I had this

6
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:27,359
whole list of things I was gonna ask so

7
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:29,279
no one here was from New Zealand I was

8
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:30,840
gonna say well is anyone heard of New

9
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:34,050
Zealand and has anyway yeah okay great

10
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:38,010
I'm just making sure cool so yeah I I

11
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:41,250
make music with computers and the

12
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:44,760
JavaScript part is pretty recent I've

13
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:46,320
been doing music a lot longer than I've

14
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,469
been writing JavaScript but I'm gonna

15
00:00:49,469 --> 00:00:51,719
tell you today about how the two worlds

16
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:53,640
collided for me about three years ago

17
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:59,039
and you're gonna hear what I'm going to

18
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:02,370
tell you basically the entire story so

19
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:05,820
yes sit back and enjoy and hopefully at

20
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:08,340
the end I'll be able to show you my new

21
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:11,070
zakat that I'm developing and I'll try

22
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:14,760
and make a song with it based on some

23
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:20,009
stuff from yesterday so computer music

24
00:01:20,009 --> 00:01:23,220
I'm sure a few of us here are familiar

25
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:27,090
with the concept so this is Ableton Live

26
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:29,100
this is the software that I've used for

27
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:33,990
quite a long time now and it's um it's a

28
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:35,970
way of making music where you you're

29
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:38,009
basically putting all of the individual

30
00:01:38,009 --> 00:01:41,130
notes in by hand while with the mouse so

31
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:45,810
I have about five six different

32
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:48,450
instruments here and so the first one

33
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:54,640
we've got is a synthesized bell sound

34
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:56,790
so all those sounds are hearing I've

35
00:01:56,790 --> 00:01:58,170
actually gone in here and I have

36
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:00,450
manually put them in with a mouse

37
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:02,700
actually I may have recorded this using

38
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,830
a MIDI keyboard but I'll get to it later

39
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:08,490
and but but the the point is that I have

40
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:10,470
complete control over everything that is

41
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:12,240
happening here I I see the entire

42
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:14,280
timeline out in front of me very much

43
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:17,640
like a composer would I'm not actually

44
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:21,990
playing an instrument Here I am telling

45
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:23,580
the computer where I want to hear sounds

46
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:25,230
so I'm gonna play you a little bit of

47
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:27,840
this song just so you can hear how it

48
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:53,959
all comes together so you see is a

49
00:02:53,959 --> 00:02:57,209
marker moving left to right showing the

50
00:02:57,209 --> 00:02:58,890
position and you can see the events

51
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:24,780
being played as it Scrolls past

52
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:30,200
Thanks so with this way of making music

53
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:33,140
it's more like you're painting your song

54
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:37,520
rather than playing your song

55
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,920
you're in complete control of every

56
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:43,220
single thing that happens and it's

57
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:44,599
actually quite a fun way to make music

58
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:45,860
particularly at first because you don't

59
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:47,959
actually have to be particularly skilled

60
00:03:47,959 --> 00:03:50,720
at anything you can just put things in

61
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:54,709
and they make cool sounds and that's

62
00:03:54,709 --> 00:03:57,200
what I was doing back in 2006 I was just

63
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,510
having fun making interesting

64
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:02,269
compositions on my computer I had a few

65
00:04:02,269 --> 00:04:03,830
friends that were interested in too and

66
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:05,480
we were just just basically hanging out

67
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:07,250
at school not doing any work and just

68
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:12,200
making music and then I grabbed a bunch

69
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,150
of all the songs that I've made and I

70
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:18,979
uploaded them to the Internet and I made

71
00:04:18,979 --> 00:04:22,880
some fancy cover art and I don't know

72
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,950
why but some music blog thought it was

73
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:27,710
really good and they wrote this

74
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:29,450
wonderful review all about my album and

75
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:31,789
then it got on some links sharing

76
00:04:31,789 --> 00:04:33,560
services and before I knew what I was

77
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,270
getting hundreds of visitors every day

78
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:37,130
and all these people were downloading my

79
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:39,650
album and the next thing that happened

80
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:40,820
was I started receiving some fan mail

81
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:46,610
and I started off you know like oh this

82
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:48,500
is great we love your music and the next

83
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:51,380
minute was like come play your music at

84
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:54,979
our University and how on earth do you

85
00:04:54,979 --> 00:04:59,270
play this this is not I didn't actually

86
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:02,600
perform it it's it was something that I

87
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:05,060
it's like asking asking a painter to

88
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:08,690
play their work live you can't really do

89
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:10,700
that but you can get them to exhibit

90
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:17,760
their work so a reproduction of the work

91
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:20,419
so yeah how do you play me as a computer

92
00:05:20,419 --> 00:05:23,150
music laughs and the obvious way is just

93
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:24,590
to recruit recruit a bunch of musicians

94
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:26,960
to actually play all the individual

95
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,190
parts live for you

96
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:30,230
so maybe you can play the cool synth

97
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:32,360
flying or whatever but you have someone

98
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,630
else playing the drums and someone else

99
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:37,900
playing you know the other things and

100
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:40,580
there is actually a pretty cool way of

101
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:42,920
playing electronic music live I really

102
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:45,980
enjoy bands that do that but at the same

103
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:48,440
time it's it's a lot of work and it's

104
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:50,000
not the same thing you're actually

105
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,070
having to go back to the beginning and

106
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:53,480
refigure out how you gonna play your

107
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:58,910
song live so I I have never done this

108
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:00,560
and I would love to do this play yeah

109
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,030
this is this what obviously wasn't the

110
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:03,590
way forward you need you to pay them

111
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:04,760
obviously you need to pay the musicians

112
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:07,400
and yeah I'm I just want to work on my

113
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,560
own so really the only other option I

114
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:14,870
have is to DJ my music and this is

115
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:16,820
actually the way the majority of

116
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:18,710
electronic musicians or computer

117
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:21,770
musicians play their music live they are

118
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:24,950
really just playing you what they

119
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:28,760
created in their studio it may be as

120
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:31,340
simple as changing the tempo a little

121
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:33,470
bit and mixing the songs together or it

122
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:35,630
could get elaborate and you could split

123
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:37,430
all the individual parts of your song up

124
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:41,600
you take like that sound there that loop

125
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:49,840
and the drums and then put them all on a

126
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:57,800
special launcher

127
00:06:57,810 --> 00:07:00,580
like this where I have all of the

128
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:02,380
individual parts of the song laid out in

129
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:25,420
front of me synth up here drums and we

130
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:33,070
have Hardware controllers so this device

131
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:36,160
here is called a launchpad it was

132
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,530
designed for being used with this

133
00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:40,360
software here called Ableton Live and

134
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:43,000
you can see that this grid of all my

135
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,390
clips actually corresponds to this grid

136
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:50,590
so when I push that there that clip

137
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:53,620
launches I push this button here their

138
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:58,640
whole line watches

139
00:07:58,650 --> 00:08:02,730
and I also have some knobs up here which

140
00:08:02,730 --> 00:08:05,610
control a few parameters like the filter

141
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:36,130
so

142
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:42,990
so yeah that that works alright but if I

143
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:45,420
wanted to veer off the path at all if I

144
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:47,190
wanted to just play the synth a little

145
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:50,250
bit different I'm kind of stuck with I'm

146
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:54,480
just stuck with this pattern here I'm

147
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,830
not exactly going to come over to my

148
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:57,900
computer one plane and start plucking an

149
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:01,980
extra notes because that's that's stupid

150
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:07,680
and not cool and I want to be cool we

151
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:11,550
can add another controller and that will

152
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:14,000
let me play one of the instruments live

153
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,800
so I'm still using this for all my drums

154
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:22,380
etc etc but one of the synthesizers I

155
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:25,350
could play live on top so to do that I

156
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:30,540
would just select it from my list and

157
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:33,510
turn the input on and now when I play it

158
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:48,470
here

159
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,400
and here lies the problem I can't even

160
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:55,140
play the keyboard so Who am I kidding

161
00:09:55,140 --> 00:10:03,370
yeah so all this this this is quite a

162
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:05,290
kind of quite a reasonable way of

163
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:10,240
playing your compositions alive but I

164
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,030
actually don't really find that that fun

165
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:14,470
and I tried doing this for a little

166
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:16,810
while and it was just it was just so

167
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:18,580
much work setting up everything and

168
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:19,750
putting in the perfect place and then

169
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:21,220
when you actually went to play it you

170
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:24,460
had no control you know I wanted to feel

171
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:26,140
like he could tourists they can just get

172
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:27,610
up on stage they can just start playing

173
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:29,500
their instrument and they can improvise

174
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:30,550
they can do it or they like they can

175
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:31,690
have other people playing along with

176
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:33,400
them and like a jazz band they just

177
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:36,580
groove and it's great I want to be able

178
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:38,980
to do that with electronic computer

179
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:45,640
music and well yeah obviously JavaScript

180
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:46,990
you kind of saw that one coming right

181
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:50,290
because it's J's cough bs JavaScript

182
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:51,700
that was where I went next

183
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:54,730
and the reason I went to JavaScript was

184
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:57,100
because I know JavaScript I don't know

185
00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:03,190
any other languages and yeah I thought

186
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:06,160
let's just let's just see if we can if

187
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:09,460
we can add another layer of expression

188
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:16,450
to this software here so instead of me

189
00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:19,690
having to play everything live

190
00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:22,930
or having to rely on the clips that I've

191
00:11:22,930 --> 00:11:24,850
already set up I want something in

192
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:31,960
between where I can play something and

193
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,940
head a button and that will keep looping

194
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:38,770
or I can go into a mode where everything

195
00:11:38,770 --> 00:11:40,960
is triggered perfectly on beat because

196
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:45,970
that is kind of the most important sound

197
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:48,160
of computer music so everything is

198
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,990
perfectly quantized with the tempo and

199
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:52,780
if you want to make computer music it

200
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:55,780
has to be spot-on it has to be perfectly

201
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:58,990
in time and playing this isn't going to

202
00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:07,760
get me that so what I want to do here is

203
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:10,390
intercept the messages from my MIDI

204
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:13,150
devices do something clever to them and

205
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:21,790
then send them to Ableton Live so this

206
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:25,950
device here uses a protocol called MIDI

207
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:28,960
MIDI was invented in about nineteen

208
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:31,000
eighty-something so it's quite an old

209
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,220
protocol but that makes it really simple

210
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:38,700
and every music software today

211
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:41,170
implements this protocol and just about

212
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:44,230
every hardware controller implements the

213
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:47,050
protocol too so just quickly this does

214
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:49,420
not make any sound on its own all it is

215
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:50,970
capable of doing is sending messages

216
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:56,830
saying which button has been pressed

217
00:12:56,840 --> 00:13:00,920
so using this little bit of JavaScript

218
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:09,990
oops we can see what's going what the

219
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:11,310
messages are that are coming out of this

220
00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:21,300
device so that looks pretty simple right

221
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,740
it's just a bunch of numbers there

222
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:24,300
there's only three numbers we can deal

223
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:25,620
with three numbers we're not passing

224
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:28,680
some complex protocol here so the first

225
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:31,470
number sorry the first button I push

226
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:37,040
gives us 144 48 and then either at a

227
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:42,270
some number or 0 so I push it harder we

228
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:45,420
get a high number if I push it softer we

229
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:52,110
get a small number and it goes to 0 when

230
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:56,280
you let go well this it's complicated

231
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:58,170
but that's the easy answer it goes to 0

232
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:01,380
when you let go if anyone's done any

233
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:03,060
MIDI stuff they'll know what I'm talking

234
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:07,680
about there maybe so as I go up the

235
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:17,060
scale the number in the middle increases

236
00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:25,540
and octaves that's the zero note it's

237
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:35,890
beautiful now if we wanting to intercept

238
00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:38,260
the messages we can capture them easy

239
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:40,990
enough but how do we then send them back

240
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:44,350
to Ableton Live to actually play the

241
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:46,150
things we're processing so at the moment

242
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:49,270
I'm only peeking in to the things that

243
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:50,380
are coming out of here I'm not actually

244
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:52,690
able to change it in any way but this

245
00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:55,210
little bit of code here lets me create

246
00:14:55,210 --> 00:14:58,660
what's called a virtual midi port so I

247
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:02,020
can pretend that I am a MIDI keyboard

248
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:08,570
but it's actually my own JavaScript code

249
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:13,980
so now if I run this nothing happens yet

250
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:18,190
but in this list here we now have a new

251
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:22,780
keyboard called JavaScript music so I

252
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:26,620
can hook that up here and now if I run

253
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:32,540
this again

254
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:37,120
so that was node telling Ableton Live

255
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:41,020
what sounds to play and for some reason

256
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:43,150
it didn't work as well as oh I missed

257
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:49,830
one

258
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:52,970
so I'm sending messages to both the to

259
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:55,100
the two first instruments so they play

260
00:15:55,100 --> 00:16:02,150
the same thing now this device here both

261
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:04,400
of these devices they also use MIDI it's

262
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,110
the exact same protocol that this is

263
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:08,120
using so I can use the exact same

264
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:10,820
technique to intercept the messages from

265
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:19,080
the launch pads whoops

266
00:16:19,090 --> 00:16:27,860
frame time

267
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:31,650
and now when I push buttons here you can

268
00:16:31,650 --> 00:16:35,810
see the same messages coming up whoops

269
00:16:35,810 --> 00:16:40,860
I'm just gonna disconnect from live

270
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:42,480
after I'm able to live otherwise things

271
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:46,460
would be crazy okay so we've got one

272
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:51,240
4401 27 let go it goes to zero so it's

273
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,620
just counting up from zero all the way

274
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:54,270
along we get to the end of the line

275
00:16:54,270 --> 00:16:58,080
though and it goes to 16 so we've got 8

276
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:02,640
here and then 16 and that could make our

277
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:03,960
lives a little bit trickier in the

278
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,970
future but luckily I know how to solve

279
00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:11,970
it with maths now if we send the same

280
00:17:11,970 --> 00:17:14,220
message back to the launch pad again

281
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:19,050
that we just received it will light up

282
00:17:19,050 --> 00:17:21,870
that button I don't know if you can see

283
00:17:21,870 --> 00:17:26,040
that on the projection but that button

284
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:38,169
is lighting up when I press it

285
00:17:38,179 --> 00:17:40,830
it's really loud you can all hear me

286
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:42,870
right excellent

287
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:46,049
okay I'll just I'll just play along with

288
00:17:46,049 --> 00:17:50,490
the wonderful rhythm outside so how can

289
00:17:50,490 --> 00:17:54,240
we turn this stream of MIDI data into an

290
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,220
object that is really easy for us to

291
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:58,019
transform in interesting ways

292
00:17:58,019 --> 00:17:59,940
so we're talking about being able to

293
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:06,120
loop the playback so oops I missed

294
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:09,779
something I know I didn't know if I we

295
00:18:09,779 --> 00:18:11,250
want to better loop the playback we want

296
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:14,970
to be able to quantize it align it so

297
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:18,179
I'm a real fan of the observable pattern

298
00:18:18,179 --> 00:18:20,940
and this is my favorite module for

299
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:24,029
creating observable objects it's it's

300
00:18:24,029 --> 00:18:25,620
just JavaScript which is what I like

301
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:28,590
about it so really what you're doing is

302
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:31,409
you're creating a object sorry a

303
00:18:31,409 --> 00:18:34,110
function and you can actually set its

304
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:36,269
value or you can request its value just

305
00:18:36,269 --> 00:18:40,519
by calling it and if you instead pass a

306
00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:44,129
function it will call you back every

307
00:18:44,129 --> 00:18:46,860
time that changes now this here is a

308
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:50,850
very small wrapper around arrays to turn

309
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:54,629
them into two dimensions so I specify

310
00:18:54,629 --> 00:18:56,929
the shape I want of the array which is

311
00:18:56,929 --> 00:19:00,509
three high and four across and I pass it

312
00:19:00,509 --> 00:19:03,899
some data and it will data and it will

313
00:19:03,899 --> 00:19:08,610
stick it like that so I can ask what is

314
00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:11,220
it position 0 1 what is it position 1 2

315
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:14,820
etc etc and then this little bit of code

316
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:17,669
here no just the two together it gives

317
00:19:17,669 --> 00:19:20,820
us an observable grid so every single

318
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:25,500
time I play something over here is

319
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,629
actually returning a whole new immutable

320
00:19:27,629 --> 00:19:30,299
object that represents the state the

321
00:19:30,299 --> 00:19:41,910
entire launchpad at that exact moment

322
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:45,290
and whoops

323
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:52,660
try it out

324
00:19:52,670 --> 00:19:56,990
so now you can see I have a grid

325
00:19:56,990 --> 00:19:59,690
representation of the data of my button

326
00:19:59,690 --> 00:20:06,220
presses here

327
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:08,870
and if I want to send that I want to

328
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:11,900
translate that grid back into MIDI to

329
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:14,360
then forward onto Ableton Live I can use

330
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:16,100
this really complicated little function

331
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:18,020
here it's actually quite simple when you

332
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:20,090
break it down but all its really doing

333
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:22,670
is every single time there's a change to

334
00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:25,550
the object it scans through to see if we

335
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:27,620
can find out what's changed and then it

336
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:30,190
will send that particular message

337
00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:34,610
through to Ableton Live so it's kind of

338
00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:38,360
it's converting our snapshots into back

339
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:49,409
into a stream of changes

340
00:20:49,419 --> 00:20:54,039
so now we can hook it up to our other

341
00:20:54,039 --> 00:20:57,579
grid by saying whenever the input grid

342
00:20:57,579 --> 00:21:00,519
changes sit at same value to the output

343
00:21:00,519 --> 00:21:15,540
grid

344
00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:18,760
so it may not sound that exciting but

345
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:21,830
that message is going from the launch

346
00:21:21,830 --> 00:21:26,240
pad into JavaScript and then into the

347
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,550
music application so we can do anything

348
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:31,130
we like now at this point we can we can

349
00:21:31,130 --> 00:21:33,550
transform what I'm doing over here in

350
00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:39,800
any way that we can imagine and I can

351
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,360
also send it to the launch pad as well

352
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:48,630
just so we get the lights lighting up

353
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,050
it's it's really hard to see on this

354
00:21:51,050 --> 00:21:54,110
camera unfortunately but no it's not

355
00:21:54,110 --> 00:21:59,030
gonna work it's really overexposed get

356
00:21:59,030 --> 00:22:02,470
my white hands in there then we can know

357
00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:05,300
that the lights are lighting up though

358
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:09,020
believe me okay so this is what we have

359
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:13,820
so far like I said now if we want to do

360
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:15,110
anything clever with this observable

361
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:17,330
object transform it into another another

362
00:22:17,330 --> 00:22:19,910
form like like I was talking about with

363
00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:22,700
a looping or the quantization we can use

364
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:24,230
this module here called observe

365
00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:30,830
transform and it's really just a special

366
00:22:30,830 --> 00:22:33,980
kind of observable object that does

367
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:35,510
something to the data as it passes

368
00:22:35,510 --> 00:22:40,120
through so you set it with one value and

369
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:43,760
it will call you to ask a little

370
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:46,100
callback and I asked what object do you

371
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:50,270
want this to be actually what object you

372
00:22:50,270 --> 00:22:52,220
want to be notified to everyone else so

373
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:54,110
you can transform the data to become

374
00:22:54,110 --> 00:22:59,600
anything at that point so this here is

375
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,730
using these two other helper methods

376
00:23:01,730 --> 00:23:05,660
called connect and send whoops so just

377
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:08,990
clean up our code quite a bit so instead

378
00:23:08,990 --> 00:23:12,890
of having all of this stuff we can just

379
00:23:12,890 --> 00:23:14,780
do that and it becomes a lot easier to

380
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:17,300
see the signal flow here so we're taking

381
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:18,680
the launchpad

382
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:22,790
and we are sending it to the output grid

383
00:23:22,790 --> 00:23:25,010
and also sending it back till they walk

384
00:23:25,010 --> 00:23:28,770
the launchpad to light up the button

385
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:36,590
oops I'm just gonna and this is a

386
00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:39,620
transform using that transform function

387
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:42,590
we just imported before and what all it

388
00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:45,980
does is whenever there's a change it

389
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:49,220
then calls keep range on that input

390
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:52,430
which is part of the array grid that

391
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:54,320
I'll be using they can you can request

392
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:57,110
just one little part of it so every

393
00:23:57,110 --> 00:23:59,510
single time the main grid is changing

394
00:23:59,510 --> 00:24:02,360
you'll get another grid there is only a

395
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:04,700
small portion of the first grid so we

396
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:08,780
can just grab that that one whoops that

397
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:16,380
one part of the grid

398
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:23,770
and oops how did i zoom no ah this there

399
00:24:23,770 --> 00:24:24,190
we go

400
00:24:24,190 --> 00:24:26,230
yeah I had three fingers I was resting

401
00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:33,919
my okay and we'll stick that in there so

402
00:24:33,929 --> 00:24:37,360
we are slicing the grid up into a bunch

403
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:40,360
of smaller grids which are thin so we

404
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:43,030
take a slice and then we send it to the

405
00:24:43,030 --> 00:24:47,530
output so the first range is 3/8 which

406
00:24:47,530 --> 00:24:51,760
means three down and eight across so

407
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,890
it's that whole zone there the one below

408
00:24:53,890 --> 00:25:00,100
it is to eight so it's two two down and

409
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:03,010
across and so on and so forth and I am

410
00:25:03,010 --> 00:25:06,010
seaming 144 for the first one but 145

411
00:25:06,010 --> 00:25:07,390
for the next one and so on and so forth

412
00:25:07,390 --> 00:25:09,040
so that actually lets me split it out

413
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:19,560
into different channels in my software

414
00:25:19,570 --> 00:25:24,520
whoops channel 2 channel 3 channel 4

415
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:31,660
channel 5 and channel 6 so if I save

416
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:35,020
that and then run it I get a big error

417
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:38,650
because I deleted the input grid wait

418
00:25:38,650 --> 00:25:40,420
why is the Empire I probably got console

419
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:44,210
that log in here somewhere

420
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:53,090
there we go you read that

421
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:55,960
so now this first line here the first

422
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:58,690
three lines play the the bells

423
00:25:58,690 --> 00:26:20,240
instrument but the next one down and

424
00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:26,050
that's working pretty great but as I

425
00:26:26,050 --> 00:26:28,690
said before the most important thing

426
00:26:28,690 --> 00:26:30,250
about computer music is that everything

427
00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:32,770
is perfectly in time and there's just no

428
00:26:32,770 --> 00:26:34,720
way that I can play as perfect as a

429
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,880
computer and there are certainly people

430
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,740
that do have the skills to do this and

431
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:40,180
if you look them up on YouTube you can

432
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:42,220
find some amazing performances people

433
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:43,540
that are actually playing things live

434
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:45,550
with your fingers but I can't do that

435
00:26:45,550 --> 00:26:46,840
and I don't want to do that and I don't

436
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:48,580
think it really represents computer

437
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:50,260
music anyway it's it's another art form

438
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:51,730
and it's great but it's not computer

439
00:26:51,730 --> 00:26:58,870
music so how do we quantize how do we

440
00:26:58,870 --> 00:27:03,530
align things perfectly with the clock

441
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:06,490
Ableton Live has the ability to send out

442
00:27:06,490 --> 00:27:08,890
a clock signal and what that really is

443
00:27:08,890 --> 00:27:12,430
is just a pulse at a certain it's 24

444
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:14,440
times it will seem to pulse perfectly

445
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:16,350
aligned to the current tempo every beat

446
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:18,790
so that's quite a few ticks every second

447
00:27:18,790 --> 00:27:22,440
at 120 beats per minute that's like 48

448
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:28,030
different events and we can hook into

449
00:27:28,030 --> 00:27:31,270
that clock using another virtual midi

450
00:27:31,270 --> 00:27:38,530
port like this so we and we're now

451
00:27:38,530 --> 00:27:41,500
listening on clock input as well and if

452
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:45,220
we log that out you'll see a whole bunch

453
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:47,320
of messages coming in and that's coming

454
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:50,140
in extraordinarily fast it's coming in

455
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:54,580
at 107 beats per minute so that'll be 24

456
00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:58,360
I don't know math had yep so I'm gonna

457
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:02,159
use a computer to figure that out for me

458
00:28:02,169 --> 00:28:04,519
so this little bit of code here creates

459
00:28:04,519 --> 00:28:08,419
another observable object every single

460
00:28:08,419 --> 00:28:11,629
time it receives that message 248 it

461
00:28:11,629 --> 00:28:16,539
increments this value here and it also

462
00:28:16,539 --> 00:28:19,429
figures out the current beat by then

463
00:28:19,429 --> 00:28:22,039
dividing another by 24 again so what you

464
00:28:22,039 --> 00:28:33,910
get out of this

465
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:37,580
is the current play that position I've

466
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:40,610
got three four five six seven eight nine

467
00:28:40,610 --> 00:28:44,120
ten and if I change the tempo here you

468
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:45,650
can see that number getting faster it's

469
00:28:45,650 --> 00:28:49,150
incrementing faster if I bring it down

470
00:28:49,150 --> 00:29:04,840
it goes slower see perfect 120

471
00:29:04,850 --> 00:29:06,530
okay so now that we've got the current

472
00:29:06,530 --> 00:29:08,630
position we can use that as part of our

473
00:29:08,630 --> 00:29:11,390
transformation so instead of just taking

474
00:29:11,390 --> 00:29:13,610
one little section of the grid we're

475
00:29:13,610 --> 00:29:16,070
going to be as I guess instead of doing

476
00:29:16,070 --> 00:29:17,840
a spatial transform we're doing a

477
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:27,620
temporal transform and we can hook it up

478
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:29,750
so I'll quickly explain how this works

479
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:32,330
every single time its value changes

480
00:29:32,330 --> 00:29:34,730
either the input value or this current

481
00:29:34,730 --> 00:29:37,010
position which is that new observable we

482
00:29:37,010 --> 00:29:39,140
just created this function down here

483
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:41,900
gets run and we're using a little bit of

484
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:46,100
mathematics no just kidding to figure

485
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:49,070
out so we've got a rate so we want to

486
00:29:49,070 --> 00:29:52,580
quantize to every beat for instance so I

487
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:54,980
can't play faster than each beat if I

488
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:56,660
hold down a note it will just keep re

489
00:29:56,660 --> 00:30:00,500
triggering that beat so we're just

490
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:02,990
voting out if we are at the start of

491
00:30:02,990 --> 00:30:05,570
that or not and if so we capture that

492
00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:07,970
frame and then we keep playing that

493
00:30:07,970 --> 00:30:11,900
frame back until we get to halfway

494
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:13,520
through and when then we just return

495
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:20,780
nothing and that sounds like it sounds

496
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:23,660
really cool I promise you so we stick it

497
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:26,210
in here the launchpad flows into the

498
00:30:26,210 --> 00:30:28,640
repeater and then it gets sent out to

499
00:30:28,640 --> 00:31:01,650
all the different instruments

500
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:09,110
so that's great yeah that's really great

501
00:31:09,110 --> 00:31:12,380
and like once I discovered that if I M

502
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:15,170
she'd tell the story correctly that was

503
00:31:15,170 --> 00:31:16,760
one of the later things I discovered I

504
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:18,620
was doing the looping stuff first and I

505
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:20,480
found that's actually the main thing you

506
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,550
need is be able to hold the buttons down

507
00:31:22,550 --> 00:31:25,340
and have it trigger perfectly in time so

508
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:27,890
it's it's kind of like you are playing

509
00:31:27,890 --> 00:31:32,750
chords of time that makes sense so I'm

510
00:31:32,750 --> 00:31:34,490
holding down buttons and instead of it

511
00:31:34,490 --> 00:31:38,570
creating a nice chord and musical sense

512
00:31:38,570 --> 00:31:41,510
it's actually creating one over a bigger

513
00:31:41,510 --> 00:31:44,180
time frame which is yeah never mind I

514
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:47,540
don't know it made sense in my head

515
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:50,330
before s it is but say we do actually

516
00:31:50,330 --> 00:31:53,870
want to be able to loop what I've just

517
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:55,580
played so say I'm playing a really cool

518
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:57,740
drum beat but I want to free up my hand

519
00:31:57,740 --> 00:31:59,090
again so that I can even play something

520
00:31:59,090 --> 00:31:59,860
else

521
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:01,910
so in order to do that it's actually

522
00:32:01,910 --> 00:32:04,520
quite simple because we have the entire

523
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:07,220
state at all times we can ask what is

524
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:11,420
the current state of the launchpad we

525
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:20,180
can record each event we can record each

526
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:24,850
event and hahahaha it is alive and and

527
00:32:24,850 --> 00:32:27,290
then we can go back in time and get

528
00:32:27,290 --> 00:32:28,910
those events later and we can take just

529
00:32:28,910 --> 00:32:31,010
one little chunk of the of the things

530
00:32:31,010 --> 00:32:32,750
that have just been played so I can be

531
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:34,970
playing something and it's recording

532
00:32:34,970 --> 00:32:36,290
everything I'm doing at all times and

533
00:32:36,290 --> 00:32:39,820
then when I push that button there I

534
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:43,460
want it to go back in time and retrieve

535
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:44,960
everything I just played and keep it

536
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:47,870
playing that's what this function here

537
00:32:47,870 --> 00:32:51,410
does so this is really simple all it's

538
00:32:51,410 --> 00:32:52,760
doing is every time there is a change

539
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:56,060
its thing just pushing it onto the onto

540
00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:58,340
an array it's really straightforward

541
00:32:58,340 --> 00:32:59,960
and this one here is just doing a filter

542
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:02,810
on that array to get the the range that

543
00:33:02,810 --> 00:33:06,320
I've asked for and that just lets me

544
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:08,330
listen to when I'm pushing the button

545
00:33:08,330 --> 00:33:09,770
and I want to say is I want to loop and

546
00:33:09,770 --> 00:33:12,940
it takes the slice and this here plays

547
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:15,680
place it back so this is just a reverse

548
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:18,530
transform it's taking the current loop

549
00:33:18,530 --> 00:33:20,900
and it is checking to see what the

550
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:22,700
current time is and if the current time

551
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:24,890
corresponds just to an event in the loop

552
00:33:24,890 --> 00:33:26,570
they will change its state and broadcast

553
00:33:26,570 --> 00:33:31,430
that out so yeah well we that's what we

554
00:33:31,430 --> 00:33:33,890
want and I would love to the live code

555
00:33:33,890 --> 00:33:35,090
it for you but I've only got ten more

556
00:33:35,090 --> 00:33:38,930
minutes so instead I am going to just

557
00:33:38,930 --> 00:33:41,570
give you one I prepared earlier which is

558
00:33:41,570 --> 00:33:43,180
right here

559
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:47,780
no MIDI and I've also added a few more

560
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:50,600
things like of these buttons here up so

561
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:53,180
I can see where things are so that's

562
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:55,370
like an undo and redo and I've got down

563
00:33:55,370 --> 00:34:10,799
here I can change the rate of repeating

564
00:34:10,809 --> 00:34:20,450
absolutely

565
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:22,389
I'm gonna stop that again that was

566
00:34:22,389 --> 00:35:25,280
really weird

567
00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:39,850
oh yeah so what about Web Audio this is

568
00:35:39,850 --> 00:35:42,970
not web audio this is node J yes and all

569
00:35:42,970 --> 00:35:45,730
I'm doing is processing a stream turning

570
00:35:45,730 --> 00:35:47,020
into another form and then putting it

571
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:48,940
straight out this is just like any old

572
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:52,510
streaming web server really and but what

573
00:35:52,510 --> 00:35:54,990
can we just get rid of Ableton Live

574
00:35:54,990 --> 00:35:57,430
altogether and just do the song we've

575
00:35:57,430 --> 00:36:01,180
audio and I really wish I'd never asked

576
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:03,600
that question I wish I just stuck with

577
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:06,340
doing this this is so simple and great

578
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:08,110
and you can explain it in one little

579
00:36:08,110 --> 00:36:11,620
40-minute talk but no I I went down this

580
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:13,720
rabbit hole and I have actually gone and

581
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:17,620
built my own application based on the

582
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:19,270
exact same things I've shown you here

583
00:36:19,270 --> 00:36:22,810
but it all runs on top of web audio so

584
00:36:22,810 --> 00:36:24,760
I've got really time to talk about the

585
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:27,490
technology behind it but we've got as

586
00:36:27,490 --> 00:36:31,120
module a wrinkled audio slot which it

587
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:36,400
lets you create it's an observable

588
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:37,540
object just like everything else so you

589
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:38,710
can put it on your grid and do clever

590
00:36:38,710 --> 00:36:40,660
things with it and you can declare what

591
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:43,120
sounds you want and will build the

592
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:46,030
necessary web audio stuff like what Paul

593
00:36:46,030 --> 00:36:48,490
was talking about but it does it for you

594
00:36:48,490 --> 00:36:49,750
so you don't have to worry about hooking

595
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:50,950
everything up it just makes it a lot

596
00:36:50,950 --> 00:36:54,250
easier to wire everything together so

597
00:36:54,250 --> 00:36:57,460
I've got that and I know I won't

598
00:36:57,460 --> 00:36:59,410
I won't show you this I will just show

599
00:36:59,410 --> 00:37:01,090
you my app so I can play you I can play

600
00:37:01,090 --> 00:37:03,220
your whole song if we if we do it now so

601
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:03,780
let's do it

602
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:11,890
okay so we'll close note don't need that

603
00:37:11,890 --> 00:37:15,370
anymore and that and close Ableton Live

604
00:37:15,370 --> 00:37:17,200
sorry Ableton

605
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:20,650
ah and down here I have my app called

606
00:37:20,650 --> 00:37:32,290
loop drop and I'll open the project now

607
00:37:32,290 --> 00:37:34,510
when I was just out the back before I

608
00:37:34,510 --> 00:37:43,599
quickly put together some sounds yeah I

609
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:47,410
I really like Douglas Douglas Crockford

610
00:37:47,410 --> 00:37:50,440
he's great but it's it's just really

611
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:53,589
cool hearing and him like regretting his

612
00:37:53,589 --> 00:37:55,990
decisions about JavaScript what did he

613
00:37:55,990 --> 00:37:57,220
say

614
00:37:57,220 --> 00:37:59,800
oops there's not going oh great here we

615
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:11,520
go technical difficulties

616
00:38:11,530 --> 00:38:17,950
yeah it's gonna have to shuffle my ports

617
00:38:17,950 --> 00:38:20,620
around of it until they work it's it's

618
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:23,320
not my apps fault it is a problem with

619
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:27,370
USB 3 and compatibility or something I

620
00:38:27,370 --> 00:38:42,720
don't know hopefully it'll work now

621
00:38:42,730 --> 00:38:46,320
now nothing's working

622
00:38:46,330 --> 00:38:48,040
oh wait no it's cuz I didn't hook it oh

623
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:50,560
gosh I didn't hook it up yeah we're good

624
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:54,580
we good everything's fine cool so let's

625
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:59,800
bring that up so we can see it okay

626
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:02,220
javascript is a hot mess

627
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:05,650
javascript was designed in 10 days it

628
00:39:05,650 --> 00:40:15,170
turns out you can

629
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:19,740
I don't know anyway I don't know whether

630
00:40:19,740 --> 00:42:02,870
it was going on this day

631
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:12,579
again that was in case I forgot the link

632
00:42:12,579 --> 00:42:15,609
to the video so yes this is my

633
00:42:15,609 --> 00:42:17,710
application it's called loop drop it is

634
00:42:17,710 --> 00:42:20,079
fully open source you can look at the

635
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:22,539
code you can hack on it you can do it if

636
00:42:22,539 --> 00:42:26,140
you like but you can also know you can

637
00:42:26,140 --> 00:42:28,599
you can buy it as well yeah if you if

638
00:42:28,599 --> 00:42:30,309
you don't want to like it if you don't

639
00:42:30,309 --> 00:42:34,470
know how to use NPM then you can buy it

640
00:42:34,470 --> 00:42:39,339
I'm trying to encourage a new kind of

641
00:42:39,339 --> 00:42:42,730
open-source where people that can

642
00:42:42,730 --> 00:42:44,859
develop as sorry can contribute by

643
00:42:44,859 --> 00:42:47,009
developing you can get it for free but

644
00:42:47,009 --> 00:42:50,349
people that just want to like use it and

645
00:42:50,349 --> 00:42:55,200
abuse it they can pay me it's great so

646
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:58,690
everything you saw is JavaScript HTML

647
00:42:58,690 --> 00:43:00,700
CSS all that stuff but I'm using

648
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:03,249
electron which is a wonderful tool by

649
00:43:03,249 --> 00:43:05,680
github to package it all up and turn it

650
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:06,849
into an application that actually runs

651
00:43:06,849 --> 00:43:08,920
on your desktop and it has access to

652
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:11,220
everything node has as well so it's

653
00:43:11,220 --> 00:43:14,619
chrome and nodejs

654
00:43:14,619 --> 00:43:17,559
smack together so I can have full file

655
00:43:17,559 --> 00:43:19,539
system access which is great for an

656
00:43:19,539 --> 00:43:21,160
audio application because it means you

657
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:22,269
don't have to be worrying about shifting

658
00:43:22,269 --> 00:43:26,289
large samples around the internet now

659
00:43:26,289 --> 00:43:28,960
destroy with science this is the name of

660
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:32,769
my band everything gonna go a bit crazy

661
00:43:32,769 --> 00:43:35,200
once I started playing with the stuff

662
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:37,480
and my old band name just didn't seem to

663
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:42,130
fit this Luna yeah so you if you want

664
00:43:42,130 --> 00:43:43,569
you can listen to some of my interesting

665
00:43:43,569 --> 00:43:45,480
experiments so every every single

666
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:49,769
Thursday night I play a live session at

667
00:43:49,769 --> 00:43:55,420
at a hack group in my city and usually I

668
00:43:55,420 --> 00:43:57,609
play for an hour along and and I put

669
00:43:57,609 --> 00:43:59,559
them on soundcloud so you can check them

670
00:43:59,559 --> 00:44:01,930
out um and yeah I have no idea what I'm

671
00:44:01,930 --> 00:44:04,980
doing I just did it I just started and

672
00:44:04,980 --> 00:44:07,210
learnt an awful lot along the way very

673
00:44:07,210 --> 00:44:10,960
much like what I in a couple of talks

674
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:11,830
before about the

675
00:44:11,830 --> 00:44:14,350
the textiles about for the Knitting is

676
00:44:14,350 --> 00:44:16,150
the exact same thing you even it's

677
00:44:16,150 --> 00:44:17,920
amazing what you can learn when you just

678
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:19,570
start doing interesting things like this

679
00:44:19,570 --> 00:44:22,120
and reaching out and but I have learned

680
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:24,720
some important takeaways from all this

681
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:28,540
so yeah just start writing but you need

682
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:30,820
to keep on rewriting over and over and

683
00:44:30,820 --> 00:44:32,470
over and over and over again but don't

684
00:44:32,470 --> 00:44:34,270
do the whole thing at once so just throw

685
00:44:34,270 --> 00:44:38,890
everything away just rewrite the parts

686
00:44:38,890 --> 00:44:40,750
that bother you right now and try and

687
00:44:40,750 --> 00:44:43,960
keep it modular so that you don't have

688
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:45,790
to throw everything away when you want

689
00:44:45,790 --> 00:44:48,370
to make a change yeah that's what I've

690
00:44:48,370 --> 00:44:48,730
got
