00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:02,700

Thank You Alan he's been killing it all

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:04,440
day at the bad jokes it's actually a

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:06,180
really hard art form because these jokes

4
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:07,680
have to be good enough that we realize

5
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:09,660
our jokes but bad enough that they're

6
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:11,700
not better than mine and that's hard to

7
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:12,170
do

8
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:14,790
alright so I'm super excited to be here

9
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:16,500
and to be speaking this time I've been

10
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,090
to one other Cascadia j/s and I wasn't

11
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:19,740
attendee and it was one of the best

12
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:21,060
conferences I've ever been to hands down

13
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:23,279
but first some housekeeping we're not in

14
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:25,560
Portland we're in Seattle there we go

15
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:29,519
all right fix that so hello I'm Michael

16
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:31,500
Ling I'm terrible at talking with myself

17
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,510
so I made this cheesy collage to do that

18
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:35,460
instead I try to get outdoors and stay

19
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:36,989
active when I'm not at a computer but

20
00:00:36,989 --> 00:00:38,820
for the most part I fail at that and I'm

21
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:40,739
just at a computer so this stage here

22
00:00:40,739 --> 00:00:43,350
isn't really my natural habitat

23
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:45,090
by day I work at this company called

24
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:47,070
hashey Corp I'm a UI engineer I build

25
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:49,410
the UI the Nomad UI we have all sorts of

26
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:51,539
open-source products there but I'm also

27
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:54,750
a volunteer so on white sand weekends I

28
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:56,489
volunteer for this organization called

29
00:00:56,489 --> 00:00:59,910
civic and here we have this mission to

30
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:01,379
make public information public knowledge

31
00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:03,210
basically we think that there's this gap

32
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:05,159
between information being public and

33
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:07,049
that information synthesizing has

34
00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:10,260
knowledge available to the people what I

35
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:12,570
registered 503 C we have two people on

36
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:14,549
payroll and our process goes something

37
00:01:14,549 --> 00:01:15,030
like this

38
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:17,009
for six to nine months out of the year

39
00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:19,560
we take about a hundred more volunteers

40
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,500
we work on five different projects

41
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23,700
ultimately creating an open API and a

42
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:25,799
web experience for each one of these so

43
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:28,770
for this 2018 project season we created

44
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:31,430
a housing affordability project a

45
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:34,070
neighborhood development project a

46
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:36,619
transportation systems project a

47
00:01:36,619 --> 00:01:40,170
disaster resilience project and a local

48
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:42,479
elections project showing them as an

49
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:43,890
ordered list like this is kind of

50
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:45,420
misrepresenting it isn't some sort of

51
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:47,399
priority queue so really an unordered

52
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:49,590
list is better but even this kind of

53
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:51,299
gives this serial idea and we didn't

54
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:52,380
work on a one after another they were

55
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:54,540
all done at the same time so this is the

56
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:55,939
best way to represent this information

57
00:01:55,939 --> 00:01:58,829
okay you may be wondering like how in

58
00:01:58,829 --> 00:02:00,299
the world did we manage to do this and

59
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:01,979
I'm so glad you asked that

60
00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:05,369
welcome to my talk so I have about seven

61
00:02:05,369 --> 00:02:06,930
lessons that I want to talk about both

62
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:08,640
successful ones and failures and the

63
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:11,250
first one is to have an org chart you

64
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:12,420
have to stay organized to your

65
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:13,740
contributors need to be organized

66
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:16,140
at a bargain we have over 100

67
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:17,820
repositories and over 200 people in our

68
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:19,770
github board working on over 30

69
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:22,770
different teams and it gets kind of

70
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:24,480
chaotic I don't think we do a very good

71
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,890
job but there are lots of examples of

72
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:27,750
people who have done this honestly

73
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:29,820
better than we have one example is amber

74
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:31,860
Jas I think that they've been very

75
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,300
thoughtful in their open governance and

76
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:34,860
their organization so they have a core

77
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:36,570
team steering committee and then

78
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:38,040
additional core teams for these sort of

79
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,110
satellite projects such as ember CLI and

80
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:42,750
amber data but the key insight here is

81
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:45,000
that your organization is in network and

82
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,790
networks are graphs and when you're

83
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:49,860
looking at graphs graph complexity is

84
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:51,870
measured by the number of edges this is

85
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:52,950
the part where even though it's a soft

86
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:54,060
steel stock I have to talk about

87
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:56,340
computer science so once you get to 50

88
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:58,590
nodes you actually have a thousand 225

89
00:02:58,590 --> 00:02:59,970
edges if everyone's talking to each

90
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:01,830
other so instead you reduce that

91
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:03,900
complexity by eliminating edges by

92
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:05,520
creating an org chart you do exactly

93
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:08,070
that but when you're doing this work you

94
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:09,960
really need to be cognizant of Conway's

95
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:13,170
law the gist of Conway's law is that

96
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:15,870
anything you make will show signs of how

97
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:18,180
that you're organized here's the whole

98
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:19,890
boy if you want to read it but I like

99
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:21,420
looking at code instead skip the

100
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:23,700
documentation and it kind of reads out

101
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:25,020
something like this first thing you want

102
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:26,730
to do is create an organization the

103
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:27,840
system is going to be something that

104
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,880
organization produces and then when that

105
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:32,310
system has issues you you try to change

106
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:33,780
things with it but that system still has

107
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:36,300
issues because the organization is what

108
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:37,860
you got to change you can also think of

109
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:40,230
it as this the system is a function of

110
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:41,880
your organization so to change the

111
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,770
system you need to change the input the

112
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:46,200
organization being really heavy-handed

113
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,490
here but this is like the

114
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:49,050
bidirectionality here is a key insight

115
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:51,330
so in 2016 or we're gonna work chart

116
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:53,520
looks up like this we had a founder and

117
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,350
we had five projects all reporting to

118
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:57,840
the founder I had great results

119
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,000
everybody loved what we built teams

120
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,830
worked really efficiently but each

121
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:03,750
project looked entirely different like

122
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:05,610
you could you wouldn't realize that it

123
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:06,960
was the same organization behind every

124
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:09,450
single one and I put an extremely heavy

125
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:10,680
burden on this person in charge

126
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:13,110
so when 2017 would change things look

127
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:15,330
like this again a founder again five

128
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:16,950
project teams but now an additional

129
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:19,140
platform team in an Operations

130
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:20,910
Coordinator who facilitated

131
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:22,500
conversations between the platform team

132
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,000
and those product teams that ops

133
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,020
coordinator is actually the room right

134
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:26,759
now hi Megan

135
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:29,430
and in 2017 we have more uniform results

136
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:30,689
which is exactly why we made the org

137
00:04:30,689 --> 00:04:32,610
chart change so that was good we had a

138
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:34,129
good distribution of responsibilities

139
00:04:34,129 --> 00:04:36,629
but it was inefficient we had the

140
00:04:36,629 --> 00:04:38,099
blocking request going through the

141
00:04:38,099 --> 00:04:39,560
founder and through the ops coordinator

142
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,849
and it sort of incentivized heroes on

143
00:04:41,849 --> 00:04:43,409
the platform team and they became single

144
00:04:43,409 --> 00:04:45,749
points of failure so again in 2018 we

145
00:04:45,749 --> 00:04:47,310
looked at it again and we ended up with

146
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:49,770
this so now there's the founder side of

147
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:51,060
the house working with the project teams

148
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:52,710
and each of these five product teams

149
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:54,389
also have the mini org chart within it

150
00:04:54,389 --> 00:04:55,830
it's some sort of leadership structure

151
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:57,900
and the technical platform side of the

152
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:59,699
house you have the CTO yours truly and

153
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:01,560
three other three teams underneath me

154
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:04,279
for DevOps for front-end and for design

155
00:05:04,279 --> 00:05:07,379
again each with their own team lead we

156
00:05:07,379 --> 00:05:08,849
had uniform results which is good we

157
00:05:08,849 --> 00:05:10,889
didn't backslide we still had a good

158
00:05:10,889 --> 00:05:12,990
distribution of responsibilities and it

159
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:14,550
was more efficient because blocking

160
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:15,870
requests were now being load-balanced

161
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:17,550
with these team leads but there was a

162
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:19,379
lot of management overhead and it

163
00:05:19,379 --> 00:05:21,300
repeated work being done on project

164
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:23,520
teams so I'm sure again in 2019 we're

165
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,710
gonna change some stuff but you may be

166
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:27,749
wondering how in the world didn't even

167
00:05:27,749 --> 00:05:29,759
get that many volunteers I mean like

168
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:31,319
it's really easy for my product make an

169
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:34,169
org chart it's just me like that's it so

170
00:05:34,169 --> 00:05:36,029
that leads us right into lesson two if

171
00:05:36,029 --> 00:05:39,750
you build it they won't come so we're

172
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:41,460
surrounded by popular products like this

173
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:43,139
that have over a hundred thousand stars

174
00:05:43,139 --> 00:05:45,120
and a trillion billion people liking it

175
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,919
and like we call like these engineers

176
00:05:46,919 --> 00:05:48,629
and rockstars and like Kent Dodds has

177
00:05:48,629 --> 00:05:50,669
been on 17 slides today I didn't

178
00:05:50,669 --> 00:05:51,990
actually count but that might actually

179
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:54,599
be an underestimate so products don't

180
00:05:54,599 --> 00:05:56,159
start out like this they just don't I

181
00:05:56,159 --> 00:05:58,289
had to dig this old react web page out

182
00:05:58,289 --> 00:05:59,909
of the wayback machine because this is

183
00:05:59,909 --> 00:06:00,810
what it looked like when I was first

184
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:03,419
looking into react it first off the idea

185
00:06:03,419 --> 00:06:05,250
that the react site even needs a page

186
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:07,349
called why react anymore it's kind of

187
00:06:07,349 --> 00:06:09,270
amusing but this give it five minutes

188
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:11,819
section is even better just reads react

189
00:06:11,819 --> 00:06:13,199
challenges a lot of conventional wisdom

190
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:14,550
and at first glance

191
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:16,710
some of the ideas may seem crazy and

192
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:19,050
it's just hilarious like not too long

193
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:20,399
ago they thought their ideas were crazy

194
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:22,319
and now it seems more crazy to not use

195
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:24,120
reacts ideas so things can change pretty

196
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:27,330
quickly just look at this guy

197
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:33,030
so even the richest man in the world

198
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:34,349
first had to prove that he could sell

199
00:06:34,349 --> 00:06:36,330
books before he could prove that he

200
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:38,520
could sell the promise of jobs to the

201
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:39,690
New York government for billions of

202
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:47,699
dollars so we all get caught up in

203
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:48,930
what's called this high insight bias

204
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:50,220
where we see success and we assume

205
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:51,930
that's just how it was ever going to be

206
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:53,819
it's inevitable success happens because

207
00:06:53,819 --> 00:06:55,470
that's a good project and was always

208
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:57,120
gonna be we forget to see all the hard

209
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,740
work that went in the beginning and that

210
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:00,629
the risk you take on and the potential

211
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:02,849
for failure we also get caught up and

212
00:07:02,849 --> 00:07:05,099
this sort of stars phenomenon it's

213
00:07:05,099 --> 00:07:06,509
important to note that that doesn't mean

214
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:08,159
success our front end probably gets

215
00:07:08,159 --> 00:07:09,389
Civic we have more contributors and

216
00:07:09,389 --> 00:07:11,490
stars which is kind of crazy but it

217
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:12,479
turns out you can get people interested

218
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:14,690
in your project without it going viral I

219
00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:16,500
used to think something like this

220
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:19,229
regrettably the products inevitably

221
00:07:19,229 --> 00:07:20,789
became successful but it's just not true

222
00:07:20,789 --> 00:07:23,460
I mean a bad product is likely not going

223
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:25,319
to be saved by good marketing but you

224
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:26,699
just can't rely on word-of-mouth to get

225
00:07:26,699 --> 00:07:28,590
your product out and when it comes to

226
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:30,180
getting volunteers it takes a special

227
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:31,830
form of marketing that forum marketing

228
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:33,960
actually has its own name it's called

229
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,699
recruiting so I want to talk briefly

230
00:07:35,699 --> 00:07:37,710
about some of the tactics sivak does or

231
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:40,080
has for getting volunteers first we

232
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,729
build a network we have an email signup

233
00:07:41,729 --> 00:07:44,190
pretty bread-and-butter typical

234
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:46,340
marketing technique to get sort of leads

235
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:48,029
we also want to leverage existing

236
00:07:48,029 --> 00:07:50,460
networks just by being on Meetup means

237
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:51,419
that our meetup is going to be

238
00:07:51,419 --> 00:07:52,919
recommended to people in similar ways

239
00:07:52,919 --> 00:07:54,090
and this is a great way to expand a

240
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:56,310
network we have a lead gen form for

241
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:58,440
gauging interest in skill levels and

242
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,610
then finally we interview and pitch

243
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:01,529
these people to get them on teams and I

244
00:08:01,529 --> 00:08:03,629
want to put emphasis on pitching because

245
00:08:03,629 --> 00:08:05,009
often we think of recruiting or

246
00:08:05,009 --> 00:08:06,479
interviewing as a way to challenge a

247
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:08,190
candidate but when we're challenging

248
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:09,569
candidates candidates are also

249
00:08:09,569 --> 00:08:11,370
challenging us we want to work places

250
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:14,009
that are good so we're also judging the

251
00:08:14,009 --> 00:08:15,750
people interviewing us and if you can't

252
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:17,490
get people behind your mission I'm not

253
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:19,770
going to join me please fast lesson

254
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:21,479
three here you need to ask what your

255
00:08:21,479 --> 00:08:24,719
community offers members Dan pink has

256
00:08:24,719 --> 00:08:26,849
this book called Drive where he really

257
00:08:26,849 --> 00:08:28,949
dug into what is motivation and he came

258
00:08:28,949 --> 00:08:30,840
up with these three pillars autonomy

259
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,640
mastery and purpose

260
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,550
I suspect that Dan paint must be pretty

261
00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:37,709
well off because uh money's nowhere on

262
00:08:37,709 --> 00:08:39,779
this slide and it's been my personal

263
00:08:39,779 --> 00:08:40,860
experience at least

264
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:41,969
that people will put up with a lot

265
00:08:41,969 --> 00:08:44,190
they're being compensated well or even

266
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:45,329
if they're not being compensated well

267
00:08:45,329 --> 00:08:47,010
but the alternative is no money at all

268
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:48,620
and the problems that come with that

269
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:50,550
so vault earrings in this fascinating

270
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:52,680
place where there's no money component

271
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:54,240
and we're a company gets some sort of

272
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,620
degree of forgiveness when it comes to

273
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:56,899
autonomy mastery and purpose

274
00:08:56,899 --> 00:08:58,860
volunteering doesn't people will just

275
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:01,769
leave let's look at the 2018 org chart

276
00:09:01,769 --> 00:09:04,110
one more time and let's drill into the

277
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:06,120
front end team we made a dedicated

278
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,980
funding team for the first time in 2018

279
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:09,300
and as mentioned this is because we

280
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:11,100
wanted a unified web experience for all

281
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,570
the projects and it makes perfect sense

282
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:14,310
for the organization and it honestly

283
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:16,620
came out great but it suffers when it

284
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:19,440
comes to ball to your motivation do

285
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,510
these people get mastery if you're an

286
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:22,950
apprentice engineer sure you're writing

287
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:24,600
code for the first time in a safe

288
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,459
environment with no real consequences

289
00:09:26,459 --> 00:09:29,820
because yeah gonna be fired right for

290
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:30,390
autonomy

291
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:31,740
I bet this sort of depends on how well

292
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:32,910
we were at the tickets but I like to

293
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:34,800
think that our our individual or our

294
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,300
volunteers can surprise us and kind of

295
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:38,399
go off the beaten path and for purpose

296
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:41,250
only indirectly you're working on react

297
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:42,870
components which are far removed from

298
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:44,399
fixing Portland Civic problems which is

299
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:46,140
probably what God she went to Civic in

300
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:48,449
the first place so things start kind of

301
00:09:48,449 --> 00:09:51,029
looking like work and once you realize

302
00:09:51,029 --> 00:09:52,320
that it looks like work but you're not

303
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,510
getting paid makes a lot harder to go

304
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:56,399
every night at 6:00 to 9:00 p.m. to

305
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:58,769
volunteer for this thing um I don't

306
00:09:58,769 --> 00:10:00,510
really have an answer for this one it's

307
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:02,910
just sort of something we ran into so a

308
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:04,500
lot of iteration underfunded team and

309
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,240
other platform teams also as it turns

310
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,949
out so this is just something I have to

311
00:10:07,949 --> 00:10:09,480
think about maybe something you want to

312
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:13,589
keep in mind super sad but uh here's my

313
00:10:13,589 --> 00:10:17,250
cat's well Hudson five product

314
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:20,100
management is for everyone much like

315
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:21,510
marketing early in my career I kind of

316
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:22,529
thought that product management was

317
00:10:22,529 --> 00:10:24,329
unnecessary that engineering was really

318
00:10:24,329 --> 00:10:25,680
work and product management was just

319
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,740
pretending to be an engineer so when you

320
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:29,790
think like that you kind of think

321
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:32,610
product management must be optional very

322
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:34,500
very wrong by the way product management

323
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,720
itself is an expansive and difficult and

324
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,570
complex complex career path and when you

325
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:40,949
ignore it you're gonna run into one of

326
00:10:40,949 --> 00:10:43,470
two walls but first wall is that things

327
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:44,670
are being added to your project sort of

328
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:47,250
haphazardly and this may be great for a

329
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:48,690
sense of involvement in the community

330
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:50,310
everyone's crushing it getting their PRS

331
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:52,199
merged but your personal vision kind of

332
00:10:52,199 --> 00:10:53,520
gets lost and you start to feel like

333
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,270
you're losing control

334
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:56,640
was once your baby while number two's

335
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,950
the opposite you never let go of control

336
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:01,290
your voice is final your rationale

337
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:03,000
devolves into things like well it just

338
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,580
feels right to do this or what you're

339
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:07,170
suggesting is just not good for this

340
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:07,740
project

341
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:09,750
he's Kanaly any contributors just

342
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:11,700
remember that even a benevolent dictator

343
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:13,080
is still a dictator

344
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:16,020
I went crashing right into wall number

345
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:19,350
two this year just head-on I went in a

346
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:20,730
room factored our entire funder in

347
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:22,020
architecture it's work that needed to be

348
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:23,820
done and there was a plan in my head and

349
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:25,470
I just sort of acted on it I didn't do a

350
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:26,730
good job sharing this plan with others

351
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:28,530
though so some people offered to help

352
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:30,930
but I rejected them I was just saying

353
00:11:30,930 --> 00:11:32,880
like you can help but you'll need to let

354
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,320
me finish this initial refactor first

355
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,270
and ultimately the refactor was

356
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:37,680
well-received and we were able to

357
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,600
collaborate after the fact but it would

358
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,220
be wrong to call that a flat a success I

359
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:44,100
happened at 20,000 line PR with ninety

360
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:45,720
commits and there was no documented

361
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:46,950
issue with the problem beforehand like

362
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:49,830
that's red flag City and I had a lot to

363
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:52,200
say in the pr2 about my choices and

364
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,240
ultimately I think that people were

365
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,430
happy with the changes but while I was

366
00:11:56,430 --> 00:11:58,050
working on this I just left contributors

367
00:11:58,050 --> 00:11:59,430
in the dark and I just covered it away

368
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:01,230
in a dark corner and that's no good for

369
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:03,630
those contributors so when discussing

370
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:05,040
product management we talked about

371
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,170
things like road maps or things like

372
00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:08,820
North Stars there's lots of wayfinding

373
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:10,980
metaphors pretty much all of them I

374
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:13,550
prefer the metaphor of a vanishing point

375
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:15,780
so objects that are closed should be

376
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:18,750
very clear detailed and understood and

377
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:20,130
this is what requires a media attention

378
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:22,650
as focus and focus but there's obviously

379
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:24,240
a farther away they kind of become

380
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,070
blurry ER there's a rough idea of what's

381
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:27,960
ahead and that idea is shared amongst

382
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,820
teams for release it needs to be but

383
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:31,530
it's also understood that a lot can

384
00:12:31,530 --> 00:12:33,090
happen between here and there and what

385
00:12:33,090 --> 00:12:35,670
you see may actually be a mirage so to

386
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:37,680
embrace product management he needed

387
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:38,760
spend time thinking about what you're

388
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,050
building and ask yourself these kinds of

389
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:41,250
questions what's right for your project

390
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:43,260
what's wrong for your project where your

391
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:45,660
priorities the timing right and how do

392
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:46,770
you even know if any of these things are

393
00:12:46,770 --> 00:12:48,840
true why do you feel the way you do if

394
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:51,210
you do this work you'll tear down wall

395
00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:52,980
number one because now you have a plan

396
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:55,380
you'll tear down number two well number

397
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:57,000
two because you're able to articulate

398
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,670
the reasons you're rejecting work

399
00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:01,380
communication makes all the difference

400
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:03,330
here being able to articulate your

401
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:06,360
thoughts and motivations is key no talk

402
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,040
simply without a pop culture reference

403
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,889
so here's a scene from Bojack horseman

404
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:11,759
if you aren't familiar with the show

405
00:13:11,759 --> 00:13:12,990
first you should become familiar with

406
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:15,480
the show and second Bojack is a horse

407
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:18,870
man naturally he's also a depressing

408
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:20,759
alcoholic / washed-up TV star the show

409
00:13:20,759 --> 00:13:23,040
focuses on and Todd here in red is the

410
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,810
unlikely friend who is here finally

411
00:13:24,810 --> 00:13:26,790
venting his frustrations and it's a

412
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:28,380
super intense scene and if you've seen

413
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:29,579
the show I'm sure you remember this

414
00:13:29,579 --> 00:13:31,949
scene I'm particularly drawn to this

415
00:13:31,949 --> 00:13:34,079
line you need to be better struck a

416
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:35,790
chord with him mostly because it came

417
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:38,069
from a friend like Todd could walk out

418
00:13:38,069 --> 00:13:40,230
but instead he's confronting Bojack and

419
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:42,750
saying look man you need to be better

420
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:44,970
and that's enough I can't say it's okay

421
00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:46,139
you're gonna do better next time

422
00:13:46,139 --> 00:13:48,839
flat out you need to be better and our

423
00:13:48,839 --> 00:13:50,940
friends are our fans they want us to be

424
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:52,980
better and our contributors are too they

425
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:55,560
want you and your project succeed so

426
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,060
saying no isn't automatically a letdown

427
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:59,910
but letting a project spiral or fizzle

428
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:01,670
out absolutely is

429
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:04,050
so on that low note in Lesson number 5

430
00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:07,980
lower your expectations this sounds

431
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:11,339
awful but I assure you it's not here's a

432
00:14:11,339 --> 00:14:14,010
ridiculous graph ideas come faster than

433
00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:16,529
implementations and you're never gonna

434
00:14:16,529 --> 00:14:18,389
be able to get to all of your ideas the

435
00:14:18,389 --> 00:14:20,490
optimist will say yes do all of thanks

436
00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:21,360
we can do this

437
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,800
meanwhile the past mints will say

438
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,149
something like doesn't ever be able to

439
00:14:24,149 --> 00:14:26,670
do any of this I don't like either these

440
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:27,839
outlooks I think they're both pretty

441
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:30,329
unproductive the optimist is ultimately

442
00:14:30,329 --> 00:14:31,920
going to be disappointed and the past

443
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,120
mess will achieve less than they could

444
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,069
have if they believe in themselves and

445
00:14:35,069 --> 00:14:36,449
meanwhile they're going to bring down

446
00:14:36,449 --> 00:14:39,269
everyone around them instead I like to

447
00:14:39,269 --> 00:14:40,649
sort of exist between these two spaces

448
00:14:40,649 --> 00:14:43,170
or the realist may say something like we

449
00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:44,579
have a longer backlog thing we can work

450
00:14:44,579 --> 00:14:46,440
through or the idealist may say

451
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:48,120
something like let's track all of our

452
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,889
ideas I bet we can surprise ourselves

453
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:51,990
with our output here's an unscientific

454
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:54,300
chart that basically just says I'm right

455
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:55,889
and realizing my idealism is a little

456
00:14:55,889 --> 00:14:58,829
more effective it's great go ahead and

457
00:14:58,829 --> 00:15:01,430
take pictures

458
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,400
but we need to stay tethered to the

459
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,920
reality of volunteering so I personally

460
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,540
want to be 100 at volunteering I want to

461
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:09,520
be the best that ever was like no one

462
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:10,870
ever was there we go detective Pikachu

463
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:14,590
coming in May so I also want to be 100

464
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:16,990
at my day job and I want to be 100 at my

465
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:19,360
friendships and my family in my

466
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:22,300
relationship and life upkeep but I can't

467
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:24,760
I like everyone else is bound by a 24

468
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:26,140
hour day and this is just simply too

469
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:27,880
much stuff what if I lower my

470
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:30,400
expectations I can fit everything in and

471
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:34,150
it's also when I'm kind of bored or like

472
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:36,250
I'm upset with myself I need to remember

473
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:38,590
that when I over book myself it impacts

474
00:15:38,590 --> 00:15:40,450
the lives of people around me there's a

475
00:15:40,450 --> 00:15:42,010
blast radius to everything that you do

476
00:15:42,010 --> 00:15:43,390
and it's going to impact the people you

477
00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:45,790
love so even though I've lowered my

478
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:47,800
expectations and I encourage all our

479
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,570
volunteers to sort of do the same and

480
00:15:49,570 --> 00:15:51,730
take days off over 20 18 we were still

481
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:54,820
able to ship this customized exploratory

482
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:56,230
map where we correlated poverty rates

483
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:58,180
with access to food we were able to

484
00:15:58,180 --> 00:15:59,800
share insights from public attract

485
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:02,170
campaign financing and we were able to

486
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:04,300
open up and visualize Harvard's state of

487
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:06,550
the nation's housing report and we

488
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:08,320
analyzed TriMet ridership data year over

489
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,820
year to tell them these ridership

490
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:11,470
changing how our neighborhoods looked

491
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:13,630
these years and we created personalized

492
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:15,940
Maps using the Department of geology and

493
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:17,380
mineral industries Cascadia subduction

494
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:19,270
zone research to see how different

495
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:20,950
neighborhoods would fare once the big

496
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:23,830
9.0 earthquake hits so Captain Obvious

497
00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:26,590
reporting in here slow and steady is so

498
00:16:26,590 --> 00:16:29,040
much faster than not moving at all

499
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:32,590
alright there are ways to work smarter

500
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:35,080
and not harder though so even if you're

501
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,850
doing less work you can sort of create

502
00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:38,290
an acceleration effect by doing things

503
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:41,620
like lesson six writing the docs so we

504
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:43,420
build on top of open source and one of

505
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:44,740
the great features of that as we get a

506
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:46,750
head start because our projects like

507
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:49,150
react and redux already have awesome

508
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:51,370
documentation and shout out to ducks

509
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:54,790
learn did a great job reacting Redux

510
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:57,220
both have amazing documentation but

511
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:58,210
you're never going to get something like

512
00:16:58,210 --> 00:17:00,370
this civic questions are never going to

513
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:03,010
be answered in redux Docs so there are

514
00:17:03,010 --> 00:17:06,430
benefits to writing your own one is that

515
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:08,050
you don't have to repeat your

516
00:17:08,050 --> 00:17:10,630
explanations and now volunteers don't

517
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:12,250
have to rely on you to answer all their

518
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:13,450
questions

519
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:15,460
in person explanations end up being

520
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:17,260
blocking requests well doctor

521
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:19,270
asynchronous and as much as I'd love to

522
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:21,550
scale myself out horizontally that's

523
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:23,890
called getting fat but when it's a web

524
00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:25,450
server it means you now have more uptime

525
00:17:25,450 --> 00:17:27,940
so what does this kind of product

526
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:30,430
specific documentation look like for us

527
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:31,960
it was as simple as committing markdown

528
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:34,540
files to our repos I think as engineers

529
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:36,550
we're really easily distracted by the

530
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:38,740
machinery of Docs and we quickly end up

531
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:39,790
in rabbit holes where we start talking

532
00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:41,650
about different static site generators

533
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:44,500
and templating options and how my static

534
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:45,970
dad can beat up your static dad and

535
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:48,520
different deployment pipelines and we we

536
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:49,870
sort of forget that the most important

537
00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:52,300
part of the docs are the words and that

538
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:54,010
writing good Docs is already a hard task

539
00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:55,780
and it doesn't really need further

540
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:59,500
complication on day one but keep in mind

541
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:01,120
our writing Docs doesn't have to solve

542
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,890
you of all of your responsibilities as a

543
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:05,050
mentor maybe your Doc's aren't reading

544
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:07,000
well or maybe they assume more expertise

545
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,010
than a volunteer has I mean after all if

546
00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:10,570
books were all that was needed to teach

547
00:18:10,570 --> 00:18:12,760
stuff I mean wouldn't need teachers and

548
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,020
hopefully I don't need to explain to

549
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:16,870
anyone that we need teachers all right

550
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:19,630
final lesson here this one isn't really

551
00:18:19,630 --> 00:18:21,820
my area of expertise smarter people have

552
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:24,130
said much more on this topic and they're

553
00:18:24,130 --> 00:18:25,720
way more qualified than I am but I

554
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,760
really do believe that the times up for

555
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,560
white guys who assume this is someone

556
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:32,710
else's problem so I'm gonna try to go

557
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:34,300
through some of my thinking on this the

558
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:36,580
very first question is why why should we

559
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:38,460
even care about diversity inclusion I

560
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:40,780
hear a couple common excuses over and

561
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:42,820
over the first one is sort of the

562
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:44,710
meritocracy fall people are truly

563
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:46,360
created equal then every individual

564
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:48,340
individual must be hot-swappable

565
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:51,760
or I might be a white sis hat man but I

566
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,200
read about these issues and I can be an

567
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,640
ally for people with different

568
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:57,040
backgrounds so first to clear the air

569
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:58,990
here people aren't identical no one's

570
00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:00,640
saying that we're all individuals with

571
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,980
unique experiences and perspectives

572
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:04,030
equal here means equal treatment in

573
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:08,190
equal opportunities as for that second

574
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:11,680
Hajin of the problem you may be a

575
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:13,870
fantastic ally it's absolutely possible

576
00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:15,220
but everyone suffers from unknown

577
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:17,770
unknowns and we're always learning and

578
00:19:17,770 --> 00:19:19,750
even though we try our hardest stand up

579
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:20,860
for people from different backgrounds

580
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:22,450
it's just not the same as representation

581
00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:24,670
and it's never going to be this chart

582
00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:26,410
here is completely unscientific there's

583
00:19:26,410 --> 00:19:26,570
no

584
00:19:26,570 --> 00:19:27,740
way to quantify the things that you

585
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:29,419
don't know you don't know but there's

586
00:19:29,419 --> 00:19:32,750
plenty of evidence of this problem so

587
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:34,220
let's go back in time here and look at

588
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:37,220
how a photo labs were calibrated and

589
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:39,049
they just didn't have dark skin tone as

590
00:19:39,049 --> 00:19:41,029
a mind they use this picture of a white

591
00:19:41,029 --> 00:19:42,740
woman with black gloves and it meant

592
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:45,440
that even to this day people with darker

593
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,880
complexion have a harder time showing up

594
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:49,309
on cameras in this kind of problem it

595
00:19:49,309 --> 00:19:50,210
just keeps happening

596
00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:51,440
here's another problem with dark skin

597
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,330
tone calibration where soap dispensers

598
00:19:53,330 --> 00:19:56,029
don't work and it happens again heart

599
00:19:56,029 --> 00:19:57,230
rate sensors have a problem with dark

600
00:19:57,230 --> 00:20:00,169
skin like at this point how in the world

601
00:20:00,169 --> 00:20:02,450
right this is not an acceptable problem

602
00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:04,460
to have and maybe your startup product

603
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:07,159
isn't like hand dryers you're probably

604
00:20:07,159 --> 00:20:09,200
not working on that although I bet

605
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:12,320
there's some disruption there so you're

606
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,090
thinking this isn't my problem because

607
00:20:14,090 --> 00:20:15,740
this is the niche target audience that I

608
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:18,049
can actually represent maybe I

609
00:20:18,049 --> 00:20:19,610
personally work with civic tech and

610
00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:21,139
civic tech needs to work for everyone so

611
00:20:21,139 --> 00:20:24,379
I can't avoid this but keep in mind that

612
00:20:24,379 --> 00:20:26,330
this isn't only an issue for whites this

613
00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:28,549
hetman we happen to be the dominant

614
00:20:28,549 --> 00:20:30,440
demographic which means that we carry

615
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:31,870
the most power and therefore

616
00:20:31,870 --> 00:20:34,009
responsibility for driving social change

617
00:20:34,009 --> 00:20:35,480
so even movements like me too doesn't

618
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:37,429
keep Kavanagh out of the Supreme Court

619
00:20:37,429 --> 00:20:39,019
and that's because of white guys just

620
00:20:39,019 --> 00:20:42,110
own that but individually no one is

621
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:44,960
diverse a group of white woman is going

622
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,279
to be biased towards woman needs in a

623
00:20:46,279 --> 00:20:47,629
woman at wedding excuse me in white

624
00:20:47,629 --> 00:20:50,629
history likewise a group of black men is

625
00:20:50,629 --> 00:20:52,490
going to have similar problems this is

626
00:20:52,490 --> 00:20:55,750
because diversity is a group phenomenon

627
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:58,309
only groups can be diverse this is going

628
00:20:58,309 --> 00:21:00,470
to change over time as your group grows

629
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:02,470
or the composition of your group changes

630
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:06,470
it also means that rejection on the

631
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:08,450
grounds of diversity shouldn't be taken

632
00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:11,750
personally it just means the problem

633
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:12,980
lies with what you either do or don't

634
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:15,139
add to a community but on the flip side

635
00:21:15,139 --> 00:21:17,149
if you're the person who's choosing a

636
00:21:17,149 --> 00:21:20,419
candidate or a volunteer to be to join

637
00:21:20,419 --> 00:21:23,419
your team keep in mind that diversity

638
00:21:23,419 --> 00:21:25,399
isn't always visible there are lots of

639
00:21:25,399 --> 00:21:27,049
things that make us diverse that we

640
00:21:27,049 --> 00:21:29,899
can't actually see with our eyes with

641
00:21:29,899 --> 00:21:31,669
all this in mind how can we expect DNI

642
00:21:31,669 --> 00:21:32,570
to solve itself

643
00:21:32,570 --> 00:21:34,370
someone needs be paying attention to the

644
00:21:34,370 --> 00:21:36,649
composition of your community and it's

645
00:21:36,649 --> 00:21:38,330
not enough to react once a community

646
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:40,250
gets a modulus is the issue

647
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:42,230
to compound consider shellings

648
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:44,540
segregation model it's very simple model

649
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:46,370
meant to see if segregation in the u.s.

650
00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:47,990
is potentially the result of just a

651
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:49,790
slight preference rather than an intense

652
00:21:49,790 --> 00:21:52,460
deep-seated racism I mean it ignores

653
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:54,230
mounds of historical evidence in caveats

654
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:56,120
so it's not like the most accurate

655
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:57,530
explanation of American neighborhoods

656
00:21:57,530 --> 00:21:59,090
but the emergent behavior is still

657
00:21:59,090 --> 00:22:01,130
interesting because it turns out over

658
00:22:01,130 --> 00:22:03,350
time agents do segregate based on just

659
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:05,450
this slight preference what's most

660
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:06,920
fascinating to me is that there's

661
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,480
nothing in this model that is explicitly

662
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,850
about race and sometimes people have

663
00:22:10,850 --> 00:22:12,980
reasons for their preferences I've

664
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:14,480
worked with plenty of women in tech who

665
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:15,680
look for companies that already have a

666
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:17,360
good number of women there that's

667
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,710
because they're sick of being the token

668
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:20,060
woman who suffers from token woman

669
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:22,220
problems like these are big things like

670
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:23,930
stunted career growth or an increased

671
00:22:23,930 --> 00:22:25,880
risk of sexual assault but also small

672
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,590
things like just being cold all the time

673
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:29,450
or expecting to conform to the one of

674
00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:31,310
the guys attitudes or just being the

675
00:22:31,310 --> 00:22:33,740
de-facto dishwasher I think this is a

676
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:35,810
valid preference and there are many like

677
00:22:35,810 --> 00:22:37,760
it but the grand effect is that if you

678
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,500
already have a decently sized son

679
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:41,030
Lajeunesse culture you have an uphill

680
00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:43,670
battle to fight for diversity and this

681
00:22:43,670 --> 00:22:45,170
is why it's so important to take DNI

682
00:22:45,170 --> 00:22:47,600
seriously on day one you need to be

683
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,940
proactive in recruiting individuals and

684
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:51,860
to do this well you need to have

685
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:54,140
internalized the real reason why we even

686
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:54,620
bother

687
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:56,780
it's not about hiring women so we have

688
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:58,670
women it's about eliminating blind spots

689
00:22:58,670 --> 00:23:01,790
by having more representation and if you

690
00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:03,680
can do this if you can nail recruiting

691
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,750
and that fixes half the pipeline problem

692
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:09,860
but pipes have two ends we also have a

693
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:12,350
DNI retention issue in tech so employee

694
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:13,970
attrition is normal there's nothing

695
00:23:13,970 --> 00:23:15,230
inherently wrong with that people leave

696
00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:17,750
jobs but in tech retention rates are

697
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:20,510
lower among underrepresented groups this

698
00:23:20,510 --> 00:23:22,340
means that even if you do an outstanding

699
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:23,930
job recruiting a diverse group of

700
00:23:23,930 --> 00:23:25,730
volunteers you may end up with the

701
00:23:25,730 --> 00:23:27,890
mosely homogenous group over time by way

702
00:23:27,890 --> 00:23:30,680
of attrition but you can be proactive

703
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:32,440
about ski boot engine rates as well

704
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:34,550
whole talks can be given on this subject

705
00:23:34,550 --> 00:23:37,040
we here's a starter kit first be open

706
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,960
about your values culture ad will

707
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,820
usually mean something at a company but

708
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:42,170
if you can't articulate what that means

709
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:44,510
then you're creating a space for bias to

710
00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:47,210
creep in likewise you should write

711
00:23:47,210 --> 00:23:48,830
rubrics for all of your assessments

712
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:50,600
beforehand this can be candid assessment

713
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:51,800
it could be code review it could be

714
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,630
promotion assessments but if we don't

715
00:23:53,630 --> 00:23:54,290
have a framework for

716
00:23:54,290 --> 00:23:56,060
your judgments then once again bias is

717
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:58,850
going to creep in third you should have

718
00:23:58,850 --> 00:23:59,870
these one-on-one meetings with people

719
00:23:59,870 --> 00:24:02,390
and really listen the easiest way to get

720
00:24:02,390 --> 00:24:03,500
caught off guard is by not paying

721
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:06,530
attention and I personally like I said

722
00:24:06,530 --> 00:24:08,120
like to sit in front of a computer away

723
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:10,040
from humans so I like to avoid

724
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:11,360
uncomfortable situations like everyone

725
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:11,720
else

726
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:13,100
so it's really easy to not have these

727
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:14,300
meetings because that's the path of

728
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:16,760
least resistance it's a bad thing to do

729
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:18,890
I assure you the fourth is that this is

730
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:21,140
ongoing work taking an unconscious bias

731
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:23,180
training is great but it doesn't mean

732
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:24,830
you're now impervious to any potential

733
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:27,020
misstep it's about putting in place

734
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:28,640
processes and best practices to reduce

735
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:32,930
as much risk of missteps as possible so

736
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:34,160
the last point I want to make about this

737
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:36,350
though is mostly for my fellow white

738
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:38,720
guys in the room I've talked to many

739
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,550
white guys who feel like they're now

740
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:42,500
walking on eggshells kind of consoling

741
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:44,390
on the edge and fearful of ladies social

742
00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:46,310
justice coming down and just smiting

743
00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:48,950
them into oblivion and like I'm gonna

744
00:24:48,950 --> 00:24:50,720
get that there's a lot to be mindful of

745
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:53,210
these days or really always but suddenly

746
00:24:53,210 --> 00:24:55,910
we're not aware of it so there's so many

747
00:24:55,910 --> 00:24:57,500
ways to screw up but I personally find

748
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:59,180
solace in knowing that no one is asking

749
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:01,460
you to be perfect a microaggression here

750
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:02,570
and there isn't going to melt your

751
00:25:02,570 --> 00:25:04,490
coworker turns out under represented

752
00:25:04,490 --> 00:25:07,010
people in tech like seriously tough and

753
00:25:07,010 --> 00:25:08,530
they deal with this crap every day and

754
00:25:08,530 --> 00:25:10,760
it's really easy to tell the difference

755
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:12,100
between an honest mistake and

756
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:15,410
disinterest or adversarial protest now

757
00:25:15,410 --> 00:25:17,120
this isn't to say that you should do

758
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,670
whatever you want without thinking first

759
00:25:18,670 --> 00:25:20,300
because there's so much you can learn

760
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:22,310
about others by just spinning a few

761
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:23,150
hours on the Internet

762
00:25:23,150 --> 00:25:24,470
like it's senseless to expect

763
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:26,360
underrepresented people to correct you

764
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:27,380
on things that you could have just

765
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:31,190
looked up on your own but when you mess

766
00:25:31,190 --> 00:25:33,860
up and you're going to mess up here's my

767
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:36,110
three step guide to recovery first

768
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:38,540
apologize for your mistakes second

769
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:39,980
reflect on why your mistakes were taken

770
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:42,050
the way they were and third use this new

771
00:25:42,050 --> 00:25:43,880
knowledge to be better in the future

772
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:46,370
and although like calling out white guys

773
00:25:46,370 --> 00:25:48,470
here this is good advice for everyone we

774
00:25:48,470 --> 00:25:49,760
all have baggage and it's often

775
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,470
invisible and we'd all benefit from

776
00:25:51,470 --> 00:25:52,820
taking the time to understand each other

777
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:58,220
so to wrap things up here growing and

778
00:25:58,220 --> 00:25:59,750
managing a community is just incredibly

779
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:01,730
hard work it really is and it's so easy

780
00:26:01,730 --> 00:26:03,770
to be blindsided by the responsibilities

781
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:05,600
required when you started out as an

782
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,110
engineer and gives kind of wanted to

783
00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:10,110
code and be helpful but I assure you if

784
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:11,520
you can commit to these responsibilities

785
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,770
you will ultimately build something that

786
00:26:13,770 --> 00:26:15,570
is much more helpful than it ever would
