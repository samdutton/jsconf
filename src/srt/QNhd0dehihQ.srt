00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:23,140

good morning I'm Doug I'm going to talk

2
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:26,230
about Tootie which in my opinion is a

3
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:29,680
fun way to browser test my name is Toby

4
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:33,100
ho and I want to thank my employer data

5
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:35,860
track for making it possible for me to

6
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:42,460
be here this is me i'm outside in the

7
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:45,239
parking lot taking a picture of myself

8
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:48,340
just after getting a haircut from super

9
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:52,810
walmart in preparation for coming here

10
00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:54,190
to this conference to give this

11
00:00:54,190 --> 00:00:58,210
presentation so now that you know my

12
00:00:58,210 --> 00:01:04,030
qualifications let's begin i'm going to

13
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:06,520
show off a side project which i've been

14
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:09,220
working on since the end of last year it

15
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:12,820
is called Tootsie Tootsie is an Italian

16
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:15,759
word that means all together you may

17
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:18,280
have seen it in musical scores where it

18
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:22,660
is used as a signal to the band to play

19
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:29,340
all together Tootsie the project is a

20
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:32,200
JavaScript console that is capable of

21
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,869
executing JavaScript on multiple web

22
00:01:34,869 --> 00:01:40,899
browsers simultaneously so the website

23
00:01:40,899 --> 00:01:45,369
is to tjs calm in order to get started

24
00:01:45,369 --> 00:01:48,100
first you create a room a room is just a

25
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:50,410
way in which I keep everybody separate

26
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:53,470
separate so that everybody is an

27
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:55,750
executing JavaScript on everybody else's

28
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:58,750
browsers so I'm going to go ahead and

29
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:02,110
create a room and at this point I'm

30
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:07,509
dropped into a JavaScript show where I

31
00:02:07,509 --> 00:02:11,990
can execute any arbitrary JavaScript

32
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,220
this you're out here is associated with

33
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:18,730
the room that it is connected to so if

34
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:21,010
you want to connect another browser you

35
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:23,980
would just copy and paste the URL into

36
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:26,980
that one as well so I'm going to update

37
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:30,380
it to the room that I just created

38
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:35,090
so now that both Safari and chrome are

39
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:38,930
connected to this room any JavaScript

40
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:42,170
that you execute here will be executed

41
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:45,710
by both browsers and the results of both

42
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:51,230
will be displayed so I'm going to

43
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:54,380
connect a few more browsers now to start

44
00:02:54,380 --> 00:03:02,260
start off

45
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:08,120
I have a Firefox 4 and I'm going to tack

46
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:13,850
on a cup of IE instances as well I want

47
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:21,250
IE 8 as well as I 7 so to emulate ie7 I

48
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:24,770
will go into developer tools and put it

49
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:31,400
into a e7 milk so now we can use the

50
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:34,160
browser's command to see the set of

51
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:36,560
browsers that are connected to this room

52
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:43,550
right now also i want to mention there's

53
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:45,380
just three comments that are available

54
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:48,020
in this console the help will print the

55
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:50,720
help message browsers as you just saw

56
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:54,290
and reset will reset the javascript

57
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:57,380
sandbox which basically means it

58
00:03:57,380 --> 00:03:59,660
destroys the iframe that you're running

59
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:01,820
your code in and creates anyone so

60
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:04,400
everything is blown away you start a

61
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:12,980
fresh so let me let me just put all

62
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:15,350
these windows side by side here arrange

63
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:19,130
them okay and I'm going to use chrome as

64
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:26,440
the driver so in general any javascript

65
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:30,380
most for the most part you throw some

66
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:32,540
javascript at these browsers they will

67
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:37,580
give you the same at same answer but not

68
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:43,460
always so sometimes browsers just cannot

69
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:48,790
agree on what to do for some edge cases

70
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:56,600
for example let's say I were to create

71
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:59,840
an input element and set the value to a

72
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:03,110
multi-line strength if i get the value

73
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:07,190
back the browser's do not agree some

74
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:10,100
will just concatenate the lines others

75
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:12,860
will put a space in between and some

76
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:15,590
others some other older browsers

77
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:20,360
will preserve that new life so if you

78
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:26,480
ask them who they are they will give you

79
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:29,570
extremely long names differentiating

80
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:37,490
themselves from each other but then

81
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:41,360
again maybe just maybe they're not all

82
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:47,570
that different from each other so this

83
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:51,830
is just a brief demo of 2t the web-based

84
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:55,790
version but that is not all there's also

85
00:05:55,790 --> 00:06:00,680
a command line version of 2t which you

86
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:09,350
can install using NPM install 2d so once

87
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:12,350
you do that you can start it by saying

88
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:16,120
2d and then giving it the room URL and

89
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:19,610
now there's to the right in your console

90
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:24,740
and here basically anything you can do

91
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:28,130
in the web version you can do here with

92
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:30,620
the exception that since this is not

93
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:33,260
actually a browser it's not responsible

94
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:35,690
for executing any JavaScript it just

95
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:40,930
sends them out so I forgot to mention

96
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:46,190
console if you if you do a console that

97
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:50,450
log then it will render it in blue

98
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:53,900
instead of green and the green the green

99
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:56,960
is the actual return value of this

100
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,540
statement that you just execute it and

101
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:01,850
then the blue is any council messages

102
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:05,960
that you print em so you can use exit to

103
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:09,890
accept that now also comes with that NPM

104
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:14,840
package is a JavaScript driver which you

105
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:17,060
can use to script all the browsers that

106
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:21,770
are connected to the room so i will show

107
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:24,230
you how to is this tool oh by the way

108
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:27,169
should i make it a little

109
00:07:27,169 --> 00:07:31,129
maybe all right I'm going to show you

110
00:07:31,129 --> 00:07:33,650
how to use it use the library so first

111
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:38,479
you require to t inside which there is a

112
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:46,879
2d constructor so you call the 2d

113
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:50,120
constructor again with the URL of the

114
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:55,340
room you want to connect to the first

115
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:57,999
thing you want to do is register our

116
00:07:57,999 --> 00:08:02,930
binding to the message event this will

117
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:05,779
tell you of any messages that the

118
00:08:05,779 --> 00:08:08,930
browser's are passing to you so I'm just

119
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:11,930
going to console lock this message for

120
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:16,909
now so once you do that you can start

121
00:08:16,909 --> 00:08:20,509
using the eval method to send the

122
00:08:20,509 --> 00:08:27,700
browser JavaScript

123
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:30,720
so I send the browser's some JavaScript

124
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,709
all of them executed and it sent me back

125
00:08:34,709 --> 00:08:37,890
these replies some of them are the

126
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:40,979
console messages others are the replies

127
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:43,680
which give you the return value of the

128
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:51,390
statement you could also has in the

129
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:57,089
function here if you like and then that

130
00:08:57,089 --> 00:08:59,190
would also just get executed in the

131
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:04,170
browser and but with the library there's

132
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:08,070
an added capability now you can load

133
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:13,560
some local you can load some local files

134
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:17,190
and have the files get executed in the

135
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:20,430
browsers as well which I'll show to you

136
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:30,639
right now

137
00:09:30,649 --> 00:09:38,480
so so I have a test suite that's written

138
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:42,889
in jasmine or risk using jasmine which

139
00:09:42,889 --> 00:09:47,089
jasmin have been using it for a while

140
00:09:47,089 --> 00:09:49,509
and i highly recommend it it's very

141
00:09:49,509 --> 00:09:55,639
full-featured and very solid so i have a

142
00:09:55,639 --> 00:09:58,670
test suite and i want to run it how am I

143
00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:01,579
gonna run it well I'll just write a

144
00:10:01,579 --> 00:10:04,879
script using the 2d driver so this is

145
00:10:04,879 --> 00:10:11,600
that script first we connect to reuse

146
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,629
the driver to connect to the 2t server

147
00:10:13,629 --> 00:10:17,899
here I'll just update it with our URL

148
00:10:17,899 --> 00:10:23,209
for the room I have a display function

149
00:10:23,209 --> 00:10:26,540
that will print out any console log

150
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:28,100
messages that come back from the

151
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:30,170
browsers and right now I'm only

152
00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:32,749
interested in the console log and any

153
00:10:32,749 --> 00:10:36,999
errors that come out essentially the

154
00:10:36,999 --> 00:10:39,589
result of the tests is going to be

155
00:10:39,589 --> 00:10:42,079
locked to the council in this example

156
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:46,249
and so once i am connected first I want

157
00:10:46,249 --> 00:10:48,529
to reset the sandbox to get a

158
00:10:48,529 --> 00:10:51,819
predictable environment then I just load

159
00:10:51,819 --> 00:10:55,759
the file the set of files that I need so

160
00:10:55,759 --> 00:10:58,279
first there's Jasmine the testing

161
00:10:58,279 --> 00:11:01,850
framework Jasmine console Jasmine

162
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:04,839
reporter is the reporter that i wrote to

163
00:11:04,839 --> 00:11:08,319
print the test results into the console

164
00:11:08,319 --> 00:11:12,079
instead of displaying it in HTML and

165
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:14,749
then there's the implementation file and

166
00:11:14,749 --> 00:11:18,170
the test file and then at the end i'm

167
00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:20,449
just going to use eval to kick off the

168
00:11:20,449 --> 00:11:23,480
test suite at the end i'm just going to

169
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:26,480
exit out of this program but before that

170
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,809
I want to wait for the console message

171
00:11:29,809 --> 00:11:32,149
to come in because that's what tells us

172
00:11:32,149 --> 00:11:36,709
the test results so let's try running

173
00:11:36,709 --> 00:11:37,680
that now

174
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:51,750
I saw it reset the sandboxes and tada so

175
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:56,010
offer so it ran the tests in our five

176
00:11:56,010 --> 00:11:58,830
browsers but for completeness I'm going

177
00:11:58,830 --> 00:12:01,649
to show you a felling test I'm just

178
00:12:01,649 --> 00:12:07,890
going to mess up this code and run it so

179
00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:10,110
that's that's what it might look like

180
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:16,740
with fouling tests now if you do TDD you

181
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:18,450
might notice that it's sometimes it's

182
00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:20,490
tedious having to switch back and forth

183
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:23,430
between your editor and your console all

184
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:27,149
the time so but with no Jas is kind of

185
00:12:27,149 --> 00:12:30,899
easy to write a script that or monitor

186
00:12:30,899 --> 00:12:33,330
any changes in your source file and then

187
00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:37,440
rerun the tests automatically so I have

188
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:48,510
a script that does that

189
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:50,830
so now this time i just have the

190
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:54,220
required scripts in an array and then i

191
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:57,310
just say for each script going to do a

192
00:12:57,310 --> 00:12:59,980
watch file on it for modification and

193
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:03,610
then anytime it's modified any of them

194
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:07,110
I'll just rerun the tests pretty simple

195
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:13,900
and i'm just going to demo for you the

196
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:23,090
the workflow of doing TDD using this oh

197
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:27,520
I better update update the script to

198
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:39,070
come to the right one okay

199
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:43,450
ok the first first time around it just

200
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:46,610
it just ran on all five browsers that

201
00:13:46,610 --> 00:13:48,890
there weren't any tests yet because

202
00:13:48,890 --> 00:13:51,350
these are empty files so for this

203
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:53,960
exercise I'm just going to write a shim

204
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:59,790
for the array prototype dot map method

205
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:05,310
so i'm going to say describe array map

206
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:14,569
it should know

207
00:14:14,579 --> 00:14:18,089
and i'm going to say expect if I map 1 2

208
00:14:18,089 --> 00:14:25,019
3 2 i just multiply everything by 2 then

209
00:14:25,019 --> 00:14:30,720
I should get a value equal to 2 4 6 here

210
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,119
I save it and it sees the changes and

211
00:14:33,119 --> 00:14:36,569
automatically rerun the tests so it

212
00:14:36,569 --> 00:14:40,529
passed in Safari Firefox and Chrome but

213
00:14:40,529 --> 00:14:42,660
not in IE because I e doesn't support

214
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:46,399
that method so i guess i'll just have to

215
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:54,179
write the method myself so i'm going to

216
00:14:54,179 --> 00:14:57,559
say if it doesn't exist and I'll just

217
00:14:57,559 --> 00:15:07,410
use my own implementation

218
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:11,450
so I need a returning array and a cache

219
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:23,740
the length

220
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:37,130
at the end return and yep and so yay it

221
00:15:37,130 --> 00:15:38,990
passed everything it passed it for all

222
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:47,200
the browsers that I'm interested in so

223
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:49,940
now that that's a gross simplification

224
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:53,750
of the map method obviously I could go

225
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:55,760
further and make it more correct but I'm

226
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:58,100
not going to so the point of this is

227
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:02,290
just to show you what how TDD might work

228
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:13,130
using the tootsie driver but the 2d

229
00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:14,570
driver you can use it for other things

230
00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:20,360
too not just testing and i'm going to

231
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:25,880
show you i'm gonna build a browser

232
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:28,790
feature comparison table using the 2d

233
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:44,050
driver so i wrote a script

234
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:47,060
update it to the room that I just

235
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:51,500
created arrow script that will it'll

236
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:54,890
first load modernizer the feature

237
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:58,760
detection library and then it will

238
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:01,070
basically loop through the moderniser

239
00:17:01,070 --> 00:17:04,940
object for each of the features that it

240
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:10,190
detects and it'll built a print awesome

241
00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:15,740
table headers and it'll it'll and then

242
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:18,800
it'll out the row for that browser but

243
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:22,370
it will just put an X in the rows up in

244
00:17:22,370 --> 00:17:25,100
the column it'll put an X in the column

245
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:28,160
where that corresponds to the feature

246
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:32,600
that that browser supports so I don't go

247
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:34,670
line by line through this script but

248
00:17:34,670 --> 00:17:38,470
i'll just show you what it does here no

249
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:45,920
so if i say like run it oh that's not

250
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:53,360
very okay i'll put it into a file let it

251
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:56,820
come

252
00:17:56,830 --> 00:18:05,860
okay hopefully it's working we missed I

253
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:08,470
seven somehow but you get the idea so

254
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:15,190
it's a textual table like this so table

255
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:17,649
in ascii essentially but also happened

256
00:18:17,649 --> 00:18:19,510
to have some code lying around that will

257
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:24,059
convert that ASCII table into HTML so I

258
00:18:24,059 --> 00:18:26,740
run the script that does the whole thing

259
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:36,460
now

260
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:40,680
ok

261
00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:46,870
ouch we lost a couple of browsers let me

262
00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:54,389
see if I can get them back

263
00:18:54,399 --> 00:18:56,590
sure

264
00:18:56,590 --> 00:19:02,810
Oh

265
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:07,380
okay yay so yeah just by running that

266
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:11,279
script now have generated this feature

267
00:19:11,279 --> 00:19:16,320
comparison table nice okay so last thing

268
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:22,669
I want to show you is you can also do

269
00:19:22,669 --> 00:19:34,470
npm install to t server so in case to

270
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:38,190
tjs com goes down maybe because I'm I

271
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:43,139
can't afford to have it stay up so once

272
00:19:43,139 --> 00:19:46,470
you install this you just run to t

273
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:49,889
server and it will serve to tea on port

274
00:19:49,889 --> 00:20:02,290
8080 so you can access it directly

275
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:08,120
access directly on port 8080 this is

276
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:11,330
running in standalone mode which there

277
00:20:11,330 --> 00:20:13,820
is only one room there are no multiple

278
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:16,220
rooms because presumably you're just

279
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:19,190
running it on your own so but you can

280
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:22,190
use this top-level URL in any of the

281
00:20:22,190 --> 00:20:31,400
places that I show in the demo so this

282
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:34,190
is still early days for this project if

283
00:20:34,190 --> 00:20:37,040
you play with it and you come across any

284
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:39,830
issues please report it please report

285
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:44,120
them to get up that is it for me thank
