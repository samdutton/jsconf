And control it and do some analysis. As a result, of the icon\h and because of\h I had\h
I find there are amazing people interested

2
00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:45,399
in stuff. And so many of them created a group
like live: JS. Thank you, JSConf EU, for giving

3
00:00:45,399 --> 00:00:52,609
me the power to believe in myself. To speak
in front of people. To see that failure is

4
00:00:52,609 --> 00:01:07,490
something and only exists to let me grow.
Thank you for being you.

Weâ€™ve come so far, and we've reached so

00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:28,360
high
And we want to stay

00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:47,120
>> You might wonder how we ended up in this
situation.

10
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:55,720
>> So, yeah. Hello\h hello JSConf. We\h
>> Woohoo!

11
00:03:55,720 --> 00:04:01,900
>> We want to show you how this stage was
built. And I would love to get the slides

12
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:13,180
now, please. As everything is working. So,
yeah, there should be slides. And the title

13
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:27,000
of this talk is how\h no\h making of the stage.
And yeah. The second slide says

14
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:33,520
[ Laughter ]
Oh, there it is. Thank you.

15
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:38,510
[ Applause ]
Yeah, you see? We don't practice anything.

16
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:49,720
We just do everything live. Oh, so the clicker
is also not working. Yeah. So, we have live:js.

17
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:59,010
We consistent of, yeah, different people.
The core team consists of Jan, Martin, Matt,

18
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:09,880
Ruth, Sam, and myself. And we would like to
explain how all of this is working or not

19
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:17,139
in a small presentation. And I will give the
microphone now to Zach. Actually, the clicker.

20
00:05:17,139 --> 00:05:31,020
>> Thank you. Hello. So, we prepared a very
easy to understand overview for you about

21
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:39,310
what has happened since about November. We
were like planning this.

22
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:47,710
So, basic this is what you know. You see this
is kind of the stage. And you might remember

23
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:53,660
the beautiful presentation of the curators
you saw today. A nice keynote. And the keynote

24
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:59,820
didn't work because, you know, keynote restricts
the width to something like 4,000 pixels.

25
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:08,860
We needed to take something else. Keynote,
please. Obviously not PowerPoint. So, we took

26
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:19,020
Google Slides. They allowed us to get the
8,204 pixels that we needed. And basically,

27
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:26,850
that was our first little hurdle that we overcame.
So, in this presentation you might remember

28
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:34,570
many people have already worked on this presentation.
Including me doing some background graphics

29
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:41,180
for that. Which also was quite a pain because,
you know, if you put in Google Slides, SVG

30
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:45,990
wouldn't work so you have to go over the EMF
files, which is a vector form of very old

31
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:51,230
time and so on and so on. That was already
a little bit complicated but actually worked

32
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:56,790
out fine. And, of course, in such an intro,
you want an opening title. We asked our beautiful

33
00:06:56,790 --> 00:07:06,931
friends to prepare some animation for us for
which they needed Illustrator files and they

34
00:07:06,931 --> 00:07:12,260
did some after effects magic with it. And
the after effects magic went into like the

35
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:18,220
moving, and the JSON files. And the JSON files
were exported to SVG files and that's what

36
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:28,840
you basically saw in JS. And you also saw
a beautiful live video from Ruth and Sam that

37
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:37,000
went in and you will see and enjoy today some
more. That is Canvas and WebGL.

38
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:42,840
And all of this\h including all the slides\h
to make it work in the browser because that

39
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:52,860
was what we aimed for. And that was our concept.
And then you heard also beautiful music also

40
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:59,820
made for the browser with web audio from Jan
and Matt. And this music actually came from

41
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:11,199
Sam. Thank you, Sam. And everything is here
lighted in color theme and rhythm item with

42
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:21,900
his custom interface that he did using DMX.
Thank you, Sam. And, yeah. That's about it.

43
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:29,190
Then we also saw a wonderful beautiful image,
because what is JSConf without the opening

44
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:34,889
of the audience's programming and for the
tenth\hanniversary we had something very special

45
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:42,979
going on here. That was made with WebGL and
a beautiful also live WebGL presentation in

46
00:08:42,979 --> 00:08:47,629
order, well, you're guessing it, to work in
the browser.

47
00:08:47,629 --> 00:08:55,430
Yeah. And somebody had to pull all of this
together, thank you, Martin. So, somebody

48
00:08:55,430 --> 00:09:01,620
has to take all that stuff and bring it into
the browser and switch between stuff. Doesn't

49
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:12,290
always work fine. But it was a sweaty job,
Martin did it. And we had help from Paul who

50
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:19,470
went up the stage and checked our performance.
We actually succeeded in doing a good job.

51
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:26,850
Thank you, Paul. But then Paul broke our browser.
But that's okay. Happens sometimes. So that

52
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:34,410
was basically in short very easy to understand
a nonchaotic overview about what has to happen

53
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:40,050
to do this. Thank you.
[ Applause ]

54
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:49,869
>> Yes. So, this was kind of an overview.
So, now we want to explain the\h all the small

55
00:09:49,869 --> 00:10:00,019
moving parts. So, what we got from JSConf
was a song that you heard. And, yeah, we should

56
00:10:00,019 --> 00:10:07,269
make a cover out of this. And the only one
doing this stuff in our group is usually Sam

57
00:10:07,269 --> 00:10:14,319
with his Game Boys. So, what he did is he
created the remix using this framework you

58
00:10:14,319 --> 00:10:20,420
can actually see on the screen. And, yeah,
you heard it also.

59
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:31,329
And this is not enough. So, we also met or
Monday evening this week to actually have

60
00:10:31,329 --> 00:10:40,610
tech week with the whole crew. And in the
end, we had like kind of this scrum board

61
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:47,959
with many, many tasks and hopefully the most
important parts are done. And one of the focus

62
00:10:47,959 --> 00:10:54,949
things across was the intro. So, we actually
created some kind of timeline and to be sure

63
00:10:54,949 --> 00:11:03,980
what we wanted to do. And we also wanted to
do more remixes because we have two more musicians

64
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:11,580
in our group, and they all want to play with
the music. And first of all, it's Matt. And

65
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:16,500
the second of all is them and they want to
talk about the stem cells.

66
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:26,449
>> Hey, I'm Matt. And the reason I'm here
with live:js and at this festival is because

67
00:11:26,449 --> 00:11:37,369
in 2015 I was invited to talk about my web
audio and electronbased sequences sampler

68
00:11:37,369 --> 00:11:46,619
and synthesizer that I made for my own personal
use. And gave a big talk in the Singapore

69
00:11:46,619 --> 00:11:51,889
JavaScript conference. And then I met all
these wonderful people here. And we have been

70
00:11:51,889 --> 00:11:59,879
hanging since. But in the meantime, I've actually
stopped using my software with WAV audio and

71
00:11:59,879 --> 00:12:05,079
I've switched to using actual synthesizers,
samplers and drum machines. Because it turns

72
00:12:05,079 --> 00:12:11,300
out that actual things are better than virtual
things. But, hey.

73
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:20,850
But for a JavaScript conference here, the
last JSConf EU, me and Jan thought that it

74
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:28,259
would be wonderful if we actually made a full
thing in WAV audio instead of just using our

75
00:12:28,259 --> 00:12:36,729
hardware. One last time for you people. And
Jan's going to tell you all about that.

76
00:12:36,729 --> 00:12:44,740
>> Okay. So, yeah. You can\h this is all open
source now. So, you can go there. You can

77
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:50,850
take a look. It's currently it's a little
bit hard to play. But we hope that we can

78
00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:56,069
fix that at some point so you can just open
the website and play that. So, the brief was

79
00:12:56,069 --> 00:13:03,759
to basically create a remix from that song
from Sam. And we, as musicians we have certain

80
00:13:03,759 --> 00:13:09,009
softwares that we like to use. One of them
is able live, a professional like musicmaking

81
00:13:09,009 --> 00:13:14,929
software and it was really easy. It's like
an IDE for song writing, basically. So, it

82
00:13:14,929 --> 00:13:20,949
was really easy to do sketches. Much easier
than programming something. And so, we did

83
00:13:20,949 --> 00:13:25,910
sketches in there. You can pull in the remix,
you can pull in audio, you can do all kinds

84
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:32,410
of things. But at some point, we had to, you
know, get this somehow in the browser. And

85
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:39,449
the main language that music tours speak still
is Midi. And Midi is not ring tones or something

86
00:13:39,449 --> 00:13:49,239
for those that remember ring tones. It is
a very old protocol from 1983 which allows

87
00:13:49,239 --> 00:13:52,950
musical instruments to talk to each other.
And it's still in wide use. You can see it

88
00:13:52,950 --> 00:14:00,339
here on stage. It's great. It's reliable,
it's old, it's robust. Much different than,

89
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:08,579
for example, getusermedia or something. And,
yeah. And for some reason\h and I still haven't

90
00:14:08,579 --> 00:14:14,679
understood why\h we now have web midi which
allows us to talk to midi instrument from

91
00:14:14,679 --> 00:14:20,029
the browser. And so, what we could do is still
keep all of our arrangement enabled live and

92
00:14:20,029 --> 00:14:27,549
send this to the thing that we've built over
the last four days or, so which is a combination

93
00:14:27,549 --> 00:14:35,020
of different modules. It's a sampler. It's
a synthesizer. It's a playback device. It

94
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:41,239
has lots of effects. A whole bunch of things
you can take a look at. And all of this is

95
00:14:41,239 --> 00:14:50,129
driven by Ableton live. And it's wonderful
because it also allows you to set cue points

96
00:14:50,129 --> 00:14:55,290
and everything. So, we were able to switch
between different scenes of the intro and

97
00:14:55,290 --> 00:15:01,470
we could also send synchronization data to
Martin's computer who would then play certain

98
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:09,989
videos or, you know, not videos. Not actual
videos but, you know, animations and 3D animations

99
00:15:09,989 --> 00:15:13,660
and stuff like that.
So, yeah. That's how we built this. Take a

100
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:18,269
look at it. Yeah. And we hope we can give
you something so that you can play it back

101
00:15:18,269 --> 00:15:28,989
on your own.
>> Okay. So, now let's come to the actual

102
00:15:28,989 --> 00:15:33,470
setup on the stage. And this is where Martin
should come and say something.

103
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:41,929
>> Yeah. But I think I would just give you
some basic facts about the stage. As you can

104
00:15:41,929 --> 00:15:51,819
see, it is big. The main screen is something
around 40 meters wide and 5 meters high. And

105
00:15:51,819 --> 00:15:59,060
yeah. Okay. Doesn't work so well. So, we have
five projectors. They are perfectly aligned

106
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:11,610
to create one continuous image. And this one
image is 8,000 x1,000 round about pixels wide.

107
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:20,339
We run this from a single PC that has three
dual HD outputs. And so, it outputs like 11,000.

108
00:16:20,339 --> 00:16:27,259
But we only have the browser window a little
bit smaller than that.

109
00:16:27,259 --> 00:16:35,429
So, additionally to this big screen and the
projectors we have all these light panels

110
00:16:35,429 --> 00:16:47,779
around here. 34 of them which are controlled
by software. And finally, we have this nice

111
00:16:47,779 --> 00:16:53,839
little X over there which has an interesting
story behind it. Originally it was supposed

112
00:16:53,839 --> 00:17:00,459
to be canvas and projected on. But then it
turned\hus that projectors have sort of a

113
00:17:00,459 --> 00:17:03,379
focus. So, we couldn't really project anything
sharp on it.

114
00:17:03,379 --> 00:17:11,360
So, Matt had the idea to put it full of LEDs.
And we were almost ordering 200 meters of

115
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:19,399
these LED strips in order to make it work.
Until suddenly someone who would have been

116
00:17:19,399 --> 00:17:26,049
responsible for soldering it all together
was like, wait. We have these\h these professional

117
00:17:26,049 --> 00:17:29,500
LED panels lying around and maybe you just
use them.

118
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:43,659
So, these are 17 panels. Each of 192x192 pixels.
So, in total, much more than we could have

119
00:17:43,659 --> 00:17:53,889
bought with LED strips. And it's controlled
with a single\h full HD signal which is the

120
00:17:53,889 --> 00:17:59,840
full screen browser window as you might have
guessed. And those are the specs that we received

121
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:04,019
for this.
And it works surprisingly well. If you want

122
00:18:04,019 --> 00:18:10,471
to create content for it, there is a CodePen
somewhere if you check Twitter, JSConf, you

123
00:18:10,471 --> 00:18:17,280
should be able to find it. Where all of these
positions are already\h yeah\h hardcoded and

124
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:25,830
you can just like start doing that. We'll
probably show some of these at least tomorrow.

125
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:35,669
Yeah. And I guess that's it for me. Yeah.
[ Applause ]

126
00:18:35,669 --> 00:18:38,710
Yeah. Yes, Ruth.
>> Yeah, sorry, the slide. It's not here.

127
00:18:38,710 --> 00:18:45,950
So, next thing is\h this is Ruth.
>> Yeah, we'll just mention. She did do all

128
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:53,340
the design for everything as well as everything
else, by the way. So, yeah.

129
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:59,850
[ Applause ]
So, yeah. My software. So, I started building

130
00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:05,700
a piece of audiovisualization software approximately
five years ago, I think? This was very much

131
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:10,809
an experiment. Like we got the web audio API
about seven years ago and I started analyzing

132
00:19:10,809 --> 00:19:16,690
it and moving stuff around the DOM. I started
playing with SVGs. And this is a great idea

133
00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:21,230
until you chuck about a hundred SVGs at the
DOM and analyze audio at the same time and

134
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:27,190
try to move them around. I quickly moved to
Canvas. But the software which I built, and

135
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:34,960
I have been building it for five year was
a tangled spaghetti code. And I was gigging

136
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:41,679
with it, mixing video to the beat, mixing
Canvas shades and crashing every five minutes.

137
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:47,020
It was a great experiment and I had a really
great time making it. But I came to this year,

138
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:53,860
it's probably a good time to start naught,
naught, point naught, one instead of naught

139
00:19:53,860 --> 00:20:00,600
point naught, naught, naught version. And
it would be good to do one thing.

140
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:05,690
So, I started this year, and for the past
couple of weeks, especially during this hack

141
00:20:05,690 --> 00:20:10,770
week, I have been basically been trying to
get it to a stage to use it for circumstantials.

142
00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:19,120
Sam is doing visuals with me. It's got four
moving parts. And it's doing one thing. And

143
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:26,639
focus on my style as an artist. It's generative.
It basically just chucks some Canvas with

144
00:20:26,639 --> 00:20:33,510
some parameters. I'm analyzing audio and using
midi as well. And it just generates visuals.

145
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:42,210
That's what I want it to do. No more video
or mixing, just visuals. And four moving parts,

146
00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:48,260
colors, turn into palettes. I've got vectors
and turn into grids. I put some physics in,

147
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:57,850
I'm looking forward to that. And shapes. Shapes
are going make sprites. And when it came to

148
00:20:57,850 --> 00:21:06,840
the X, Martin mapped the X to use the normal
screen. We knew where the positions were.

149
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:12,470
I made a CodePen with the coordinates of where
these positions were. For me, I was pretty

150
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:17,870
okay. She had made a grid system. I could
make a custom grid, just map the coordinates

151
00:21:17,870 --> 00:21:23,380
of the X, right? So, if we take a look at
that. There's a great contentious with my

152
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:27,870
software.
All I have to do\h this is a normal visualization

153
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:32,460
going on. I can't see what's going on.
>> Yeah, it's working.

154
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:39,009
>> I just pipe in the coordinates and map
nice little squares like we saw for the opening

155
00:21:39,009 --> 00:21:46,210
which actually didn't take too much effort
in the end. So, yeah. This is available on

156
00:21:46,210 --> 00:21:52,690
GitHub. The URL is there. It is in a state
of getting it working for this conference.

157
00:21:52,690 --> 00:21:54,720
But yeah. That's Bizra.
[ Applause ]

158
00:21:54,720 --> 00:22:10,889
>> Yeah. So, that's powering the O and the
X. And we also have a software which is powering

159
00:22:10,889 --> 00:22:15,519
the whole stage behind me. And Sam will talk
about that.

160
00:22:15,519 --> 00:22:20,049
>> Indeed. Hello. So, yeah, I'm just going
to quickly run you through modV. And if all

161
00:22:20,049 --> 00:22:25,320
goes well, you should be able to see my desktop
in modV in the center. The X is kind of in

162
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:33,270
the way. But never mind, hey. Hey, there we
go. Perfect. Thank you. So, yeah, this is

163
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:40,299
modV. Wow. This is a screenshot, the X is
in the way. But modV is an environment that

164
00:22:40,299 --> 00:22:46,419
I have been building in the browser for I
think it's six years this year now. It's Canvas,

165
00:22:46,419 --> 00:22:52,289
WebGL. It's all audio reactive. It's got a
whole module system which you can kind of

166
00:22:52,289 --> 00:22:58,450
just drop in new modules. So, like if we just
did everything that's going on. We can just

167
00:22:58,450 --> 00:23:04,250
kind of drop in, I don't know, some sound
calls.

168
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:12,500
And then if we just give it some signal through
the microphone. Yeah. So, you can kind of

169
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:16,679
see it going there. But then you can stack
this, and it's got a whole UI and you can

170
00:23:16,679 --> 00:23:23,049
build modules for it. Yeah. To get this working
because modV has a plugin system, Martin sent

171
00:23:23,049 --> 00:23:28,190
me the specs for the wide screen. So, this
whole wide screen is actually a 1080 signal

172
00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:35,799
split into two sections. The top section is
the lefthand side of the screen, and the bottom

173
00:23:35,799 --> 00:23:42,049
signal is the righthand side of the screen.
And with the plugins I could hook into the

174
00:23:42,049 --> 00:23:48,659
plugin and spawn a new output window and that's
just actually running on another desktop here.

175
00:23:48,659 --> 00:23:55,809
If I swipe, that's my desktop background.
So, yeah, this is just another browser window

176
00:23:55,809 --> 00:24:03,919
for the software that I just kind of am tinkering
away at in my free time. It's all open source.

177
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:11,949
Go to modV.JS.org. It's all there. But, yeah.
That's a quick run through, really.

178
00:24:11,949 --> 00:24:19,850
[ Applause ]
>> Yeah. So, now we are switching to the software

179
00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:26,289
I'm creating, I have been doing this also
for five years now. And I'm controlling the

180
00:24:26,289 --> 00:24:34,500
lights. And this is how my software looks
like. And it's\h it's getting its databased

181
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:41,580
on what we use as projecting. And you can
see in the top I have a grid of colors which

182
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:47,700
I get from modV and I'm mapping them to the
actual lights that you can see in the venue.

183
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:52,919
And now we'll just go over to my PC to actually
make sense of what I'm saying so that you

184
00:24:52,919 --> 00:25:09,450
can see that the lights are working. So, yeah.
This is all\h also controllable by a midi

185
00:25:09,450 --> 00:25:18,269
controller and I can just add kind of different\h
yeah. Visuals in modV and this is presented

186
00:25:18,269 --> 00:25:27,909
live on the lights. Yeah. Which is pretty
cool. I think. And all of this is connected

187
00:25:27,909 --> 00:25:37,519
to the XPort using a custom created web use,
and there's a controller. As you can see it

188
00:25:37,519 --> 00:25:44,309
here, using an Arduino. And this is everything
in the browser. There's no server running

189
00:25:44,309 --> 00:25:51,159
at all. Yeah. So, you can control lights that
are actual everywhere just with the browser

190
00:25:51,159 --> 00:25:57,850
window which is cool. I think.
[ Applause ]

191
00:25:57,850 --> 00:26:06,049
Yeah. And that's like how we built the stage
and how we worked together to actually get

192
00:26:06,049 --> 00:26:13,000
you this live show. And you see there are
a lot of moving parts which could go wrong.

193
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:18,220
Especially if you're just using everything
in the browser. And to debate get you some

194
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:26,480
kind of goody, we released the song that Sam
created on Sound Cloud. You can find it on

195
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:40,970
his sound Cloud if you want to. Yes. And that's
it from the talk perspective. We will do now

196
00:26:40,970 --> 00:27:19,960
the remixes and

197
00:27:19,960 --> 00:29:35,019
the show again. So, have fun.
