1
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:22,550
Can I send you push notifications.

2
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:25,240
Do I have to be here?

3
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:27,380
All right.

4
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:28,460
[Laughter].

5
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:29,850
So that was a poor start.

6
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:30,850
But let's try again.

7
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:31,850
Hi, everyone.

8
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:32,850
My name is Phil Nash.

9
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:38,250
I'm a developer evangelist at Twilio.

10
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:44,480
What I'm here to talk to you about today is
progressive web apps.

11
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:52,659
We've not heard a lot about them this time
around at JSConf which means it's an part

12
00:00:52,659 --> 00:01:04,430
in the life cycle of a new feature of the
way that we build applications.

13
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:09,360
What I like is the technology behind it and
what we can do with it, and the service worker

14
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:14,200
is my favourite thing, because we have JavaScript
that runs outside of our page now.

15
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,030
I love that.

16
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:24,250
What I really love about it is that it's now
supported in every major browser!

17
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:27,460
[Cheering].

18
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:36,780
This means we can start talking to our places
of work and businesses to build application

19
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:43,970
that is are better for users, can build for
interesting stuff and native app-like features

20
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:47,830
because that's some of the things that we've
been missing that the native applications

21
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:49,490
have had over us.

22
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:52,320
One of those is push notifications.

23
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,690
I think push notifications are wonderful which
is why I want to talk about them today, because

24
00:01:56,690 --> 00:01:58,530
I'm not sure you do!

25
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:05,510
Push notifications are probably important
to cover because it is not quite everyone

26
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:09,030
because we can get there, and we can do it.

27
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:10,750
You know how to do push notifications.

28
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:12,500
You have had a native app.

29
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,340
We will get there.

30
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:21,239
I just wanted to show a quick example because
I'm so delighted that it did appear - this

31
00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:22,390
is Edge.

32
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:23,670
It works in Edge.

33
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:30,870
Out of the box for the first version of service
workers push notifications came in, it was

34
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:33,319
way, and then wooh!

35
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:39,120
And I had to redownload a VM for that, because,
you know.

36
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:44,650
If I go to Can I Use, it looks red and dangerous.

37
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:46,700
If you're looking at the reds and greens on
this, it's not correct.

38
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:53,440
You want to look in the top right corner there
where it says almost 75 per cent of active

39
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:59,610
users based on the global stats, almost 75
per cent of people have access to these.

40
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:04,700
You need to be thinking about them and building
them in the correct way.

41
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:09,140
Push notifications are good, and that's what
I want to talk to you today.

42
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:12,990
We are going to cover three things.

43
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:18,550
Briefly, how to push, with then we're going
to talk about good push notifications, and

44
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:21,400
then talk about permissions.

45
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:26,480
Permissions get sculls because we're doing
it wrong.

46
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:34,180
Quickly on how to push: there's quite a convoluted
setup to make push notifications work.

47
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:40,170
You start with a user and a browser, and you
have to register your service worker.

48
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:47,019
Once you do that, you can ask for permission
to send push notifications to the user.

49
00:03:47,019 --> 00:03:54,459
When they say - if they say yes, you will
get back a URL and a couple of encryption

50
00:03:54,459 --> 00:04:02,540
keys which you will want to save on your server
somewhere so you can use them later.

51
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:06,410
When you make a push notification, from your
server you send a post request to the URL

52
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:11,209
you got which is the browser's push notification
service.

53
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:15,840
You can encrypt information with that with
the keys you got earlier so the browsers can't

54
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:22,430
read what you're sending to your users, and
then the service will send a push to your

55
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:33,120
device which will wake up the service worker,
which will react, send it back and make it

56
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,289
happen.

57
00:04:34,289 --> 00:04:38,190
I'm not going to go into the technical side
of that, the code, or anything.

58
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:57,940
If you want to find out

59
00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:05,729
about that [sound distorted].

60
00:05:05,729 --> 00:05:11,430
This is a tweet that comes across every once
in a while on Twitter.

61
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:14,490
[Inaudible].

62
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:16,570
I don't think that's true.

63
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:18,810
I don't believe that.

64
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:20,379
I want push notifications for something.

65
00:05:20,379 --> 00:05:22,160
They're useful things for us.

66
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:26,560
Push notifications are incredibly useful for
the right things.

67
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:34,720
I do believe that the person that says that
maybe doesn't want push notifications.

68
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,830
It's entirely possible that you are a person
who, when you get your phone, the first thing

69
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:44,210
you go is go to settings and turn off notifications
and never get that, and that's fine, but it's

70
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:46,320
not true for everyone.

71
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:53,350
I have examples of good notifications and
we need to hear them.

72
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:58,940
Appointment reminders is a good one.

73
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:00,490
I work at Twilio.

74
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:07,870
We've an API for sending text messages we
have had for around eight years now, and text

75
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:11,560
messages get used for notification purposes
as well.

76
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:18,900
One of our clients, the Arkansas Children's
Hospital used appointment reminders.

77
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:23,370
They cut down no-shows, bearing in mind this
is a children's hospital, appointments for

78
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:27,360
sick children's, no-shows were 20 per cent.

79
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:34,039
After they implemented notifications to say,
"You've got an appointment tomorrow", it dropped

80
00:06:34,039 --> 00:06:35,900
to two per cent.

81
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:41,180
That's real-life, important stuff, keeping
doctors doing the job they should be doing

82
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:46,110
and getting kids to appointments they need
to going to.

83
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:48,040
Chat alert is an obvious one.

84
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:53,699
I'm sure we would like to ignore them some
of the time, because they're not normally

85
00:06:53,699 --> 00:06:58,789
always good news, but then I know that having
been in Berlin for the last week, I kind of

86
00:06:58,789 --> 00:07:00,740
tried to hang out and meet one different people.

87
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:05,259
The push notifications of various chatting
and messaging people have kept me on the ball

88
00:07:05,259 --> 00:07:06,850
for that.

89
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:08,449
ETA alerts.

90
00:07:08,449 --> 00:07:09,449
Things arriving.

91
00:07:09,449 --> 00:07:14,639
If you order a car, food, any kind of delivery
at all, getting a notification that it's there

92
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:15,639
is excellent.

93
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:20,840
It means that you actually leave your house
and get in the car, or you pick up that food.

94
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:27,889
Event updates, you don't want to download
an entire native application for a one or

95
00:07:27,889 --> 00:07:28,889
two-day event.

96
00:07:28,889 --> 00:07:40,490
Some of the other events, like flights, and
three different planes to get here, being

97
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:46,389
told an updated when I could check in, and
also when there were delays.

98
00:07:46,389 --> 00:07:50,350
It makes that so much easier.

99
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:57,780
These notifications have three tenets to them
that you should consider when building push

100
00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:03,069
notifications: timely, actionable, and personal.

101
00:08:03,069 --> 00:08:04,139
Timely is sort of obvious.

102
00:08:04,139 --> 00:08:09,360
If I get a push notification to say that my
car has just arrived after I finished the

103
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,560
journey, that's not very useful.

104
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:15,100
There are other considerations to that as
well.

105
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:18,610
This is a picture that goes around Twitter
once in a while as well.

106
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:25,830
It is the Slack decision tree of whether to
send somebody a push notification.

107
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:32,519
A whole bunch of those things are time-based
stuff.

108
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:33,880
Is the person asleep?

109
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:34,880
Working?

110
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,099
Do they really need this?

111
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:41,740
Weirdly enough, when I'm using Slack, I can
be on the desktop typing a message to somebody

112
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:46,949
and my phone will buzz with a notification,
so I modified this to - that's how it works

113
00:08:46,949 --> 00:08:49,300
for me.

114
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:51,160
I don't know what's gone on there.

115
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:57,040
These are the considerations like the time
of day, the time zone, and the number of notifications

116
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,519
you're sending somebody as well.

117
00:08:58,519 --> 00:09:00,379
You don't want to keep piling them on.

118
00:09:00,379 --> 00:09:01,730
That's not helpful after a while.

119
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:11,040
Then you have actionable stuff, where you
get something that you can do something about.

120
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:15,930
If you receive a chat message from someone,
then you want to read it, respond to it, deal

121
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:17,040
with that.

122
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:20,180
If your car is here and it's time to leave
the house, or time to go on the street and

123
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:21,829
look for it.

124
00:09:21,829 --> 00:09:26,059
If your flight is open for check-in, you might
get the extra leg room seats if you check

125
00:09:26,059 --> 00:09:28,809
in now - important to me.

126
00:09:28,809 --> 00:09:31,660
Then they're personal.

127
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:34,949
One thing you might have noticed is they're
all about you.

128
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:40,319
And I'm pretty sure, if you searched Twitter
two weeks ago for push notifications, lots

129
00:09:40,319 --> 00:09:44,889
of people very surprised that they had 20
or so notifications that some guy was getting

130
00:09:44,889 --> 00:09:49,459
married, as the royal wedding goes off and
news organisations are like we must push this

131
00:09:49,459 --> 00:09:51,160
to everything.

132
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:54,899
It's not personal, actionable, or interesting
at all.

133
00:09:54,899 --> 00:09:55,899
That's not true.

134
00:09:55,899 --> 00:10:01,980
Some people probably wanted that, but I didn't,
so it's fine.

135
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:04,309
You can break the rules on this, though.

136
00:10:04,309 --> 00:10:08,149
Some people might have wanted royal wedding
notifications.

137
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:15,389
A really good example of this back in 2016
when the Guardian team in the UK covered the

138
00:10:15,389 --> 00:10:20,699
UK general election, and did this experiment
with push notifications that kept people up

139
00:10:20,699 --> 00:10:26,509
to date with how the votes were coming in
overnight.

140
00:10:26,509 --> 00:10:32,700
This is an amazing bit of work as well, because
they actually assembled this image in the

141
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:37,389
service worker, and, if you work with a service
worker, you know that there is no canvas element,

142
00:10:37,389 --> 00:10:41,639
there's no way to manipulate images properly
so they were doing it entirely with buffers,

143
00:10:41,639 --> 00:10:45,350
which is kind of amazing.

144
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:47,470
This actually shows one other thing.

145
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:51,600
In the middle between latest declared and
settings, there's a button to stop.

146
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,259
That's one they programmed in, because maybe
you do want to go to bed because this goes

147
00:10:55,259 --> 00:10:59,670
all night, and you don't want to keep hitting
notifications.

148
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:06,730
So you have to let people opt out from within
your application.

149
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:10,690
This is the Twitter iOS application where
you can choose who push notifications you

150
00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:11,690
get.

151
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:16,679
They have a bad reputation of adding things
to this and checking them, so you have to

152
00:11:16,679 --> 00:11:23,850
keep revisiting once in a while, but, if I
want at mentions but I don't want Twitter

153
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:31,790
news, because then you can go and sort it
out inside the application.

154
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:37,649
Because alternative for us on the web is terrible.

155
00:11:37,649 --> 00:11:39,369
The alternative looks a little like this.

156
00:11:39,369 --> 00:11:44,899
I'm going to go out to Chrome for a second
here.

157
00:11:44,899 --> 00:11:47,959
Make sure notifications are working.

158
00:11:47,959 --> 00:11:53,209
We are registering for push notifications
there.

159
00:11:53,209 --> 00:11:57,309
When I send one, it will come into the screen.

160
00:11:57,309 --> 00:12:04,800
It will come into the screen ... . It's not
going to do it.

161
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:05,800
Cool.

162
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:11,710
In the notification, you get to see - as you
hover over it, there are two buttons: one

163
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:13,709
importantly, is settings.

164
00:12:13,709 --> 00:12:18,629
When you click the settings button, you get
taken to this screen which allows you to block

165
00:12:18,629 --> 00:12:25,949
that individual website, and, even worse,
allows you to block all of them.

166
00:12:25,949 --> 00:12:33,939
If one website sends a bad push notification
a user can't opt out of, it's a very quickstep

167
00:12:33,939 --> 00:12:40,269
to that user blocking every single application's
push notifications.

168
00:12:40,269 --> 00:12:42,790
This is what is looks like in Firefox as well.

169
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:46,420
It's not good.

170
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:52,019
I am terrified that the rest of the internet
can affect my application in that way.

171
00:12:52,019 --> 00:12:57,689
If I'm sending useful things to a user that
they want to receive, but they get put off

172
00:12:57,689 --> 00:13:06,129
by an abuse of this API, then that is horrifying.

173
00:13:06,129 --> 00:13:13,519
So, this leads me on to the other other terrifying
part of this which is the permissions.

174
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:23,100
I found one of those tweets that kind of said,
"Dear every website, I don't want you to post

175
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:28,949
notifications to my website, I don't want
you to know my location, please stop autoplaying

176
00:13:28,949 --> 00:13:33,279
that video, I'm angry and sad now."

177
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:40,359
Websites are making using angry and sad because
they're doing this.

178
00:13:40,359 --> 00:13:45,579
The power of the web has been increasingly
increasing over the recent years as we get

179
00:13:45,579 --> 00:13:55,589
the ability to use methods and device capabilities
like geolocation, like the push notifications,

180
00:13:55,589 --> 00:14:02,350
like media devices, camera, and microphone,
Bluetooth, maybe, web TV, all of those things,

181
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:04,769
but we require permission for them because
they're more invasive.

182
00:14:04,769 --> 00:14:12,540
That is correct, and the web has had this
permissions model that you ask for it when

183
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:18,199
you need it, which is good, except we keep
asking and doing lot of things.

184
00:14:18,199 --> 00:14:21,489
It doesn't make you ask you when you need
it.

185
00:14:21,489 --> 00:14:27,029
I want to pick on a couple of sites.

186
00:14:27,029 --> 00:14:30,689
Apologies to them but they should shot have
done this.

187
00:14:30,689 --> 00:14:34,339
This is what happens when you load producthunt.com
for the first time.

188
00:14:34,339 --> 00:14:42,639
When you get there for the first time, why
are we being asked for permissions for push

189
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:45,910
notifications?

190
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:49,649
This is cnet, a tech and review site.

191
00:14:49,649 --> 00:14:51,299
Push notifications first time.

192
00:14:51,299 --> 00:14:53,600
This is sitepoint.com.

193
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:59,049
Not only permissions but an entire page overlay
asking you to pay for stuff.

194
00:14:59,049 --> 00:15:02,699
You don't even know what the site does yet.

195
00:15:02,699 --> 00:15:04,930
It's supposed to look like that.

196
00:15:04,930 --> 00:15:09,919
This is a site that does tutorials on web
development.

197
00:15:09,919 --> 00:15:16,769
YouTube did it the other day.

198
00:15:16,769 --> 00:15:18,429
This is the home page.

199
00:15:18,429 --> 00:15:23,069
It gave me no context about what it what happened
wanted to do with these push notifications,

200
00:15:23,069 --> 00:15:26,360
it justified asked for permission.

201
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:31,309
Context is absolutely kick in this case - absolutely
king.

202
00:15:31,309 --> 00:15:37,139
Would would you give permission to any site
to have one of those invasive permissions?

203
00:15:37,139 --> 00:15:41,870
This counts for geolocation, and counts for
media devices as well.

204
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:45,139
Why would you give permission to one of those
sites without context?

205
00:15:45,139 --> 00:15:53,910
And then in recent changes from Chrome, they
stopped allowing you to dismiss the permission.

206
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:56,609
You either block or allow.

207
00:15:56,609 --> 00:16:00,209
So that is straight into block straightaway,
obviously.

208
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:02,240
We need to stop this.

209
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:06,479
We need to stop this or our users will stop
it for us.

210
00:16:06,479 --> 00:16:15,279
There are sites like howtogee k saying how
to turn them off.

211
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:19,179
this is one or two sites that can ruin for
the rest of us, and ruin it for the users

212
00:16:19,179 --> 00:16:34,029
as well. and Firefox. if you're here, which
I hope you are, let's have a chat about this.

213
00:16:34,029 --> 00:16:35,879
I don't think this is cool.

214
00:16:35,879 --> 00:16:39,939
I don't think building a feature, and then
telling people that the feature you built

215
00:16:39,939 --> 00:16:45,589
into your browser is terrible is a good idea,
especially when I think we can agree some

216
00:16:45,589 --> 00:16:53,959
of those push notification examples I gave
earlier are good ideas and can help meme.

217
00:16:53,959 --> 00:16:58,209
maybe now you can think of some good reasons
to get push notifications on Firefox.

218
00:16:58,209 --> 00:17:00,769
let's sort this out.

219
00:17:00,769 --> 00:17:09,760
so, please, if you have built push notifications
into your website at all, do not demand notification

220
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:13,500
permissions on page load.

221
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,839
don't!

222
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:18,179
[Applause].

223
00:17:18,179 --> 00:17:29,190
my worry, as I said already, is that permissions
have become the new pop-ups. they will be

224
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:35,110
reviled and dismissed by users, but just the
annoyances in the browser, and it doesn't

225
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:40,299
matter what the feature behind them is, where
there is push locations, geolocation, whatever,

226
00:17:40,299 --> 00:17:43,049
they dismiss it, it's not care.

227
00:17:43,049 --> 00:17:50,380
when they dismiss them by default, our web
platform loses its power to build engaging

228
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:57,190
and useful experiences for those users.

229
00:17:57,190 --> 00:18:01,350
that little check box is terrifying.

230
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:07,710
so, please, don't demand notification permissions
on page load.

231
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:10,620
I have some suggestions, though.

232
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:14,700
I don't think I can reach everybody by standing
on stage here.

233
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:20,140
I'm glad to reach you and tell you this, but
we have to do better than that.

234
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:25,360
I have some suggestions for now, and then
for the future, how we can improve this in

235
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,360
general.

236
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:30,779
for now, it is better patterns of UX for this.

237
00:18:30,779 --> 00:18:31,779
wait.

238
00:18:31,779 --> 00:18:39,159
build up the context that will make the user
aware of why you need that permission.

239
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:46,240
Matt gaunt from the Chrome team wrote a great
post and an example application based on this.

240
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:49,500
he built a fake airline ticketing site.

241
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:53,880
once you've finished the purchase process
of an airline ticket, at the bottom of the

242
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:57,730
screen, it pops up "get notifications for
flight delays."

243
00:18:57,730 --> 00:19:02,280
you've bought an airline ticket and you have
no wish to turn up to the airport ten hours

244
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:04,600
early because your flight is delayed.

245
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:08,350
this seems like a good idea.

246
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:16,240
I know exactly what I'm going to get out of
this.

247
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,970
it can be obvious.

248
00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:21,740
still don't put the permissions up, but if
you're building a chat application like Slack,

249
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:25,539
that top bar at the top is reasonable.

250
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:30,720
it is the same for geolocation permissions.
if there there is a map on the back of the

251
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:35,860
screen behind the notification, it's probably
obvious what we are trying to do here.

252
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:36,930
that's fine.

253
00:19:36,930 --> 00:19:44,059
but, for the future, this I think is more
important, because, I think together, we can

254
00:19:44,059 --> 00:19:47,120
work to fix this in general.

255
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:52,970
this needs to be the start of a conversation
or the continuing of a conversation that has

256
00:19:52,970 --> 00:19:53,970
existed.

257
00:19:53,970 --> 00:20:01,399
My suggestion was that browsers should enforce
the user interaction before asking for a permission.

258
00:20:01,399 --> 00:20:06,210
Something like "pop-ups" where you have to
have had a click before you can pop something

259
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:07,740
up.

260
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:13,269
there's arguments about this, but you can
get involved in them.

261
00:20:13,269 --> 00:20:20,400
On the GitHub, on the WICG repos, there is
an interventions repo which is great.

262
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:27,009
issue 49 is the suggestion from have been
else that there should be an interaction before

263
00:20:27,009 --> 00:20:28,009
a permissions pop-up.

264
00:20:28,009 --> 00:20:35,610
That has stalled right now because there are
a couple of companies that have built up a

265
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:40,899
service that does push notifications on behalf
of other websites, for those websites that

266
00:20:40,899 --> 00:20:48,590
haven't managed to change on to HTTPS yet,
which you need for the service worker.

267
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:52,730
I think those businesses are tenuous at best.

268
00:20:52,730 --> 00:21:00,010
it is a - while I'm sympathetic with the fact
they're trying to build a business, I'm not

269
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:03,340
sure it's a great foundation to be doing so
on.

270
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:07,030
Maybe a user interaction is not the best suggestion.

271
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:10,269
We need to get involved and come up with better
ones.

272
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:18,800
There is the permissions API, an emerging
spec from the W3C, and it collects in one

273
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:28,490
place where you can find out if you have asked
for permission and what the response was.

274
00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:31,379
But I feel like that could be better as well.

275
00:21:31,379 --> 00:21:37,450
perhaps we could have an API that asks us
whether we can ask permission yet.

276
00:21:37,450 --> 00:21:45,470
Perhaps the browser should be implementing
some kind of heuristic

277
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:50,510
for a progressive web app, you can only add
to home screen after a certain amount of engagement.

278
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:53,880
We need this to be deterministic as well.

279
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:58,860
so being asked to ask the permissions API
whether I have enough engagement yet might

280
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:00,179
be a good.

281
00:22:00,179 --> 00:22:05,299
but again, I need more ideas, and I need more
input for this, and we need to start talking

282
00:22:05,299 --> 00:22:06,379
about it more.

283
00:22:06,379 --> 00:22:13,049
So, in conclusion, I think push notifications
are awesome - for the right things.

284
00:22:13,049 --> 00:22:21,120
not for breaking news, but for important timely
actionable and personal actions.

285
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:30,549
One more time for this one: do not ever demand
permissions for anything on a page load.

286
00:22:30,549 --> 00:22:36,410
make those notifications timely, actionable,
and personal, or don't, break the rules, but

287
00:22:36,410 --> 00:22:44,809
allow those users to opt out side your application
so they don't turn it off for everyone.

288
00:22:44,809 --> 00:22:48,960
For users like that, the whole web suffers.

289
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:54,649
They suffer because they can't get the good
notifications we're talking about.

290
00:22:54,649 --> 00:22:57,690
they will block it if they have a bad experience.

291
00:22:57,690 --> 00:23:09,610
but we, as good develop - we can pry good
experiences for these permissions and notifications

292
00:23:09,610 --> 00:23:12,169
in general.

293
00:23:12,169 --> 00:23:16,440
We might have to work together to find out
how we can do this better, but that's what

294
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:17,440
I want to see.

295
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:23,090
And I want us to see us building progressive
web apps that improve experiences for users,

296
00:23:23,090 --> 00:23:30,259
that improve the web in general, and not aggressive
web apps which get up in everybody's face

297
00:23:30,259 --> 00:23:33,200
and make users sad and angry.

298
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,290
We can go and do that.

299
00:23:35,290 --> 00:23:36,290
thank you so much.
