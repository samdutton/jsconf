1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,809

ah

2
00:00:06,819 --> 00:00:13,550
reject okay so I'm missing my notes and

3
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:14,509
it's the first time I've ever done this

4
00:00:14,509 --> 00:00:19,640
talk this could be interesting so first

5
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:23,630
and foremost I'm no I'm no expert on

6
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:25,670
health or fitness or anything like that

7
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:29,210
yeah I'm thin but that's not everything

8
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:30,710
and that's probably more luck than

9
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:34,699
anything else but after many years being

10
00:00:34,699 --> 00:00:37,610
a working development it's just a topic

11
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:39,979
that I've wanted to help people with and

12
00:00:39,979 --> 00:00:42,199
to be honest with you in Germany

13
00:00:42,199 --> 00:00:45,680
probably far better than developers I've

14
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,930
met in other countries so not all of

15
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:53,470
this will apply but some of it hopefully

16
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:58,610
so every day as a developer we're

17
00:00:58,610 --> 00:01:00,949
generally checking news keeping up to

18
00:01:00,949 --> 00:01:03,860
date with news and updates that's

19
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:06,830
happening in in the areas were working

20
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:12,400
in we're keeping an eye on issues and

21
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,850
handling them and replying to them we're

22
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:18,800
taking care of pull requests and

23
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,960
commenting and interacting with people

24
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,810
on those we may be helping out on things

25
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:26,480
like stackoverflow and other forums to

26
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:28,820
help other developers who are learning

27
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:32,810
and having problems we may be attending

28
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:34,850
and speaking at meetups and other events

29
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:39,909
and maybe we're writing proposals and

30
00:01:39,909 --> 00:01:43,909
presenting at conferences as well this

31
00:01:43,909 --> 00:01:47,150
is a lot of flexible of time and all of

32
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:50,530
this is also on top of a day job and

33
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:53,510
maybe for some people are family as well

34
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:55,940
this is quite a commitment quite a lot

35
00:01:55,940 --> 00:02:00,620
of commitment here and a lot of people

36
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:02,299
outside the development community will

37
00:02:02,299 --> 00:02:04,549
say things like don't you'll get paid

38
00:02:04,549 --> 00:02:06,770
really well don't you will get amazing

39
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:09,049
benefits and work in really cool offices

40
00:02:09,049 --> 00:02:12,520
and spend all day not really working

41
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:18,050
well this is a sometimes true

42
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:21,680
yes and not for everybody this only

43
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:25,400
tends to be some companies not all

44
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:30,010
companies and all developers and still

45
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:33,920
health is important you only get one try

46
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:40,910
at it within reason depending on beliefs

47
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:44,030
and luck and a combination of the two

48
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:52,040
maybe and whilst life is worth living in

49
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:54,200
the moment sometimes the moment can be

50
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,810
longer and more enjoyable if you're in

51
00:02:56,810 --> 00:03:01,790
good health whilst doing it so let's

52
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:04,670
have a look at some issues and I have

53
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:06,440
some facts and figures in my notes that

54
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,000
I can't currently see so I may have to

55
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,020
do a bit of really annoying switching

56
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:10,610
back with the forwards because when

57
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:11,720
giving facts and figures you want to

58
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:14,390
give the rightfax of figures so this

59
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:16,160
might be slightly annoying but we'll see

60
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:21,620
what happens so typical developer

61
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:28,160
environment here and another one and

62
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:32,450
another one apart from this last picture

63
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:34,940
where there's someone breaking my rules

64
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:36,170
but they're the best pictures I could

65
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:40,370
find everyone's sitting down as are most

66
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:44,900
of you now as well this isn't new this

67
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:48,770
debate and it will sort of up and down

68
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:50,360
whether it really is or it really isn't

69
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:53,420
and but I think now most people are in

70
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:57,080
fairly strong agreement that it is if we

71
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:00,590
all do it way too much and if you want

72
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:02,090
to read a little bit more detail on this

73
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:03,590
it's a discussion it was mainly had a

74
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:05,540
couple of years ago there's this oops no

75
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:08,540
not that that article on the Washington

76
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:10,550
Post that has a really graphic as well

77
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:13,459
but I've picked some facts here from the

78
00:04:13,459 --> 00:04:16,160
NHS they seemed as the British National

79
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,840
Health Service seem to be better than

80
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:21,100
picking them from an article or some

81
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:25,970
untrusted blog NHS does seem vaguely

82
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:29,240
more trustworthy so there's lots of

83
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,670
problems we're sitting down too much

84
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:35,230
and we are all doing it way too much and

85
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:38,480
this isn't common or unique to

86
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:41,060
development community of course all jobs

87
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:43,220
now or most jobs now a sedentary and

88
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:46,940
involve using computers and trying to do

89
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:48,530
anything else apart from sit down all

90
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:51,280
day is quite difficult and of course

91
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,710
we're always ahead of most and on the

92
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:56,420
cutting edge in the development

93
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:57,740
community so we've come up with ideas

94
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:00,350
like standing desks and actually I want

95
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:02,390
to point out in most i've picked it in

96
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:04,030
some of these pictures intentionally

97
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:08,000
because so this person has a standing

98
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,150
desk but there is a stool behind and

99
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:13,820
he's actually standing all day is also

100
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:18,680
not very good for you so um the secret

101
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:21,620
is actually variety really a bit of

102
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:23,180
sitting a bit of standing a bit of

103
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:25,370
moving maybe sitting in a few different

104
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:28,670
places giving your body a surprise and

105
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:31,130
something new experiences on a regular

106
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:33,200
basis is actually possibly the best

107
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,030
thing to do and here's some other

108
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:37,490
examples so in this picture we have some

109
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:39,830
normal desks and we have some standing

110
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:41,300
desk towards the back and these are

111
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:43,310
becoming more and more common in all

112
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:45,370
workplaces which is really good and

113
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:47,810
here's another good example of a sort of

114
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:51,800
similar mixed office the strange thing

115
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,240
is though it's more of a cultural thing

116
00:05:53,240 --> 00:06:00,800
in that I found I go to events quite

117
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,860
often and I like to stand up I've been

118
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:05,660
sat down all day and you stand up at the

119
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:07,670
back and people are really awkward about

120
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:09,680
it they always think you're

121
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,020
uncomfortable or there's not enough

122
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:14,840
chairs or say it's a strange thing that

123
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:17,120
we all know that it's bad for us and yet

124
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,130
when you try to not do it people are

125
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:23,290
really uncomfortable about it so it's a

126
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:25,940
the cultural shift has changed in that

127
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:27,500
we know we should do it so much but it's

128
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:30,040
still seen as an odd thing to do and

129
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:33,770
which is strange and yeah I still

130
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:35,360
challenge whether you can get as much

131
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,980
done standing up or sitting down it's

132
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:39,080
slightly harder and you also notice as

133
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:41,660
we'll come to in a minute it's hard to

134
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:43,790
get posture right as well

135
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:46,910
so it's a tough one but we're it's it's

136
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:48,950
something that more people are open to

137
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,810
investigating okay let's get a bit more

138
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:59,510
extreme walking disks this is it's

139
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:01,850
actually become a popular as well less

140
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:03,290
so in Europe and these are

141
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:05,300
professionally available ones I've never

142
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:06,620
been to an office like this this is

143
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:08,570
quite incredible and these are very

144
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:12,200
expensive and you can get some more DIY

145
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:16,000
options like this and there's plenty of

146
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,410
tutorials on this and this is actually a

147
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:20,600
friend of mine in Croatia this is one he

148
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:24,020
has and I know a guy in Friedrichs rain

149
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:26,240
who's done something very similar and as

150
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,100
again you can see you can actually add a

151
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:30,230
chair to it and both the people i know

152
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:33,050
who do this are incredibly thin and look

153
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:35,570
like rakes I don't know if that's good

154
00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:40,220
or bad but but so but again variety is

155
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:43,130
kind of the spice of life as we say and

156
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:46,690
there's many ways and things to try now

157
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:49,400
so posture we already had a quick look

158
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:52,100
at that this is a very traditional sort

159
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:55,310
of look at bad posture and coding

160
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:56,720
especially is one of those activities

161
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,840
you sit there you're concentrating on

162
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,960
something and in four hours later you

163
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,940
realize you've been SAT like this not

164
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:06,170
quite like this because I'm standing up

165
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:09,110
but for about four hours with your back

166
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:11,000
like that and your arms like that and

167
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,790
you suddenly think Oh God what about

168
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:16,670
done to myself and it's very hard to not

169
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:19,280
to it's very hard to avoid these habits

170
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,380
sometimes and we all know that we should

171
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:24,350
sit straight relax muscles arm 90

172
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:25,460
degrees and things like that but when

173
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:27,230
you're concentrating it's quite

174
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:28,460
difficult to concentrate on anything

175
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:31,880
else and I have a more amusing picture

176
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:37,460
there but and again posture is something

177
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:40,610
that isn't new there's plenty of advice

178
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:42,700
out there on things to try and

179
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:45,740
especially in Czech workspaces I think

180
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:49,340
we tend to get better setups but often

181
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:51,290
there's also a conscious decision for

182
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:54,880
you to try and sit better as well and

183
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:58,190
again bad posture can

184
00:08:58,190 --> 00:09:02,000
arm things like blood flow back problems

185
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,980
of course and as you get older it gets

186
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:07,370
worse and I work on computers I ride a

187
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:10,130
bike I used to play guitar none of those

188
00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:11,990
are good for your posture at all because

189
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:14,600
you always like that the whole time so

190
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:19,760
try it's hard work but try okay exercise

191
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:23,810
now I don't go to a gym I personally

192
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:27,380
think Jim's are just a an excuse for to

193
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:29,120
get money out of you can get exercise in

194
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,880
other ways as well but and this is some

195
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:35,660
advice that I want to to give simple

196
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:40,280
simple things you can try yeah this is

197
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,290
probably the when you try to find

198
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:45,500
pictures about exercise you end up

199
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:46,670
finding there's lots of pictures of

200
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:49,460
unrealistic looking people and looking

201
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:51,380
very happy with themselves this is about

202
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:54,080
the best I could most realistic picture

203
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:58,970
I could find about exercise and again

204
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:00,710
I'm missing my facts and figures

205
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:04,280
unfortunately but we all know that a

206
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:06,890
lack of exercise mixed with sedentary

207
00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:09,590
lifestyles can cause weight gain blood

208
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:14,090
flow problems heart problems leg issues

209
00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:18,650
back issues etc etc and not proposing

210
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:20,030
anything particularly difficult here we

211
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:21,440
have some very simple solutions of

212
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,510
things just to get some exercise take a

213
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:25,430
short walk every hour also gives you a

214
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:28,250
good screen break I think opinion on

215
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:30,260
whether looking at screens all day long

216
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:32,720
is bad for our eyes has changed somewhat

217
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,700
but certainly it's good to get up from

218
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:36,460
your desk for reasons we've already seen

219
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:39,110
walking meetings I don't know about you

220
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:41,150
but I'm actually a my most inspired when

221
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:43,940
I'm walking and if I could well I can

222
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:45,170
walk and work we've already looked at

223
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:49,580
that but but if I could walk more during

224
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:51,589
my day I think I would have a lot better

225
00:10:51,589 --> 00:10:54,140
ideas the blood gets pumping and you get

226
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:56,870
some amazing ideas so we have stand-ups

227
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:59,150
what about walkouts now that sounds a

228
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:01,940
bit too extreme but do some other ideas

229
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:04,100
stand up every hour there we go that's

230
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:05,990
another one we know the Apple watch is a

231
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:07,940
bit enthusiastic about telling us to do

232
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:10,810
that but you get the idea

233
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:12,940
take the stairs again this is actually

234
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:14,920
far more regular in in Germany than

235
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:17,230
other countries I've lived in and in

236
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:18,430
fact half the time there's not even the

237
00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:22,720
lift so you have no excuse and walk or

238
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,000
ride to work if possible in fact even if

239
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,110
you get public transport you're

240
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:27,100
generally getting more exercise and

241
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:29,140
driving just by virtue of walking two

242
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:31,960
stops usually standing up walking from a

243
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,490
stop to your office and things like that

244
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:36,940
and of course if you work from home you

245
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:38,350
have to try even harder with some of

246
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:43,270
these things easy running high impact

247
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:45,310
running if you're out of shape is

248
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:46,870
probably going to do you more harm than

249
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:49,690
good but even ten minutes a day is

250
00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:52,300
better than nothing or brisk walk if

251
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:55,630
you're like swimming swimming is not

252
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:57,190
only good for your fitness is also good

253
00:11:57,190 --> 00:11:59,020
for lung capacity if you have problems

254
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:00,640
like asthma and things like that you

255
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:02,350
don't have to if you're a little bit

256
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:04,300
overweight or you have bad feet it's

257
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:05,980
also good because you're not relying on

258
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:08,140
them so something like swimming is very

259
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:12,610
good mental health now this is probably

260
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:14,500
one that actually gets over looks more

261
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:19,390
because it's harder to see so it's sort

262
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:23,020
of undecided whether whilst the brain is

263
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:24,160
one of the actually one of the biggest

264
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,200
and any of your friends who have fitness

265
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,810
fans will try and tell you otherwise the

266
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:30,280
brain is actually the biggest consumer

267
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:32,950
of energy in your body it consumes

268
00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:34,900
twenty percent of the energy that you

269
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:36,970
bring into your body which considering

270
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:38,560
how much space it takes up in your body

271
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:42,040
is quite amazing it's unproven as of now

272
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:44,740
whether if you do more intellectual

273
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:49,360
activity you require more energy it's

274
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,580
sort of some reports say yes and some

275
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:53,190
say no it's sort of one that is

276
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:55,350
currently being looked at quite a lot

277
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:59,339
but those periods of constant focus

278
00:12:59,339 --> 00:13:03,130
those periods of constantly thinking put

279
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:04,930
strain on you in other ways whether or

280
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:06,490
not it's actually consuming more energy

281
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:08,890
or not as I say is controversial but

282
00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:15,339
you're still the focus is tiring this is

283
00:13:15,339 --> 00:13:17,290
not that it's not the best

284
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:18,790
representation of what I was looking for

285
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:21,459
but this is talking about the isolation

286
00:13:21,459 --> 00:13:24,339
of Technology and

287
00:13:24,339 --> 00:13:26,170
for a lot of us in this room who will

288
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:28,120
probably picked on at school and had a

289
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:31,089
horrible time and if you were a child of

290
00:13:31,089 --> 00:13:34,689
the 80s splash early 90s there was no

291
00:13:34,689 --> 00:13:37,300
real escape from that world now there's

292
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:39,100
an escape you can find people who are

293
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:41,730
like you anywhere in the world and it's

294
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:46,749
it's been empowering for many but it

295
00:13:46,749 --> 00:13:48,129
also cuts you off from the world around

296
00:13:48,129 --> 00:13:50,800
you and this especially if you work from

297
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,649
home or work in distributed teams is is

298
00:13:53,649 --> 00:13:56,589
it is something to be conscious of and I

299
00:13:56,589 --> 00:13:59,079
find myself getting less or more

300
00:13:59,079 --> 00:14:00,790
oblivious to what's going on around me

301
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:02,110
and the feelings of people around me

302
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:03,610
sometimes and we're all doing it more

303
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:05,439
and if you've noticed in the past 10

304
00:14:05,439 --> 00:14:07,089
years no one looks where they're going

305
00:14:07,089 --> 00:14:10,029
anymore because we're so used to being

306
00:14:10,029 --> 00:14:12,600
in our own world and that can lead to

307
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:16,089
side effects as well so here's some

308
00:14:16,089 --> 00:14:19,360
ideas to try to help with that isolation

309
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:23,709
of working with lots of working with

310
00:14:23,709 --> 00:14:25,329
technology but also that mental strain

311
00:14:25,329 --> 00:14:28,079
and we'll come to some of the

312
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:30,309
consequences of that mental strain in a

313
00:14:30,309 --> 00:14:31,449
minute but here's some things to try to

314
00:14:31,449 --> 00:14:33,399
prevent getting it in the first place go

315
00:14:33,399 --> 00:14:35,579
for a walk you could tell I like walks

316
00:14:35,579 --> 00:14:38,589
it's good for you speak to someone you

317
00:14:38,589 --> 00:14:41,850
don't work with and whether that be in

318
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:44,679
your company or outside of the company

319
00:14:44,679 --> 00:14:48,429
speak to the person you get your coffee

320
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:50,470
from speak to someone random on the

321
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:52,089
street it'll probably surprised the hell

322
00:14:52,089 --> 00:14:54,129
out of them but they'll make their day

323
00:14:54,129 --> 00:14:56,709
as well hopefully the petty where the

324
00:14:56,709 --> 00:14:59,980
conversation goes speak to a stranger

325
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:04,059
yeah for social actions this is this is

326
00:15:04,059 --> 00:15:05,559
one that's possibly harder for us

327
00:15:05,559 --> 00:15:08,949
sometimes it's easy to retreat into your

328
00:15:08,949 --> 00:15:11,079
own world and we've already done I find

329
00:15:11,079 --> 00:15:12,990
myself doing that i find myself avoiding

330
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:16,420
conflicts because i don't really why

331
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:18,009
would i want to go into them but

332
00:15:18,009 --> 00:15:21,069
sometimes the outcome can be far better

333
00:15:21,069 --> 00:15:23,740
than you expect and actually what you

334
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:26,589
were worried about resolves itself in a

335
00:15:26,589 --> 00:15:29,949
more positive way anyway so try to force

336
00:15:29,949 --> 00:15:31,209
yourself into a difficult situation

337
00:15:31,209 --> 00:15:33,100
you're trying to avoid on a reasonably

338
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:35,170
regular basis is also good for your

339
00:15:35,170 --> 00:15:38,130
brain as well in things like

340
00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:41,950
elasticity in your brain attend events I

341
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:43,450
don't really have to tell that to anyone

342
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:46,030
here you're all under vent so but to the

343
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:48,660
people out there attended event

344
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:52,630
volunteer be it in a related field or

345
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:54,010
unrelated field is a great way of

346
00:15:54,010 --> 00:15:55,390
getting out of your mental space

347
00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:57,610
realizing sometimes depending where

348
00:15:57,610 --> 00:15:59,170
you're volunteering that the problems

349
00:15:59,170 --> 00:16:01,300
you think you have are not as big as

350
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:03,100
problems other people have as well and

351
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:06,190
it's a great invigorate ER for your

352
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:11,560
mental health take a nap I don't know

353
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:13,510
why the northern hemisphere or northern

354
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:16,120
countries are so obsessed with starting

355
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:18,670
work at a particular time taking a short

356
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:20,680
break finishing a particular time and

357
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,720
then running away as soon as possible a

358
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,480
lot of other countries especially the

359
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:28,180
warmer countries will take siestas naps

360
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:30,190
whatever you want to call it and there's

361
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:38,380
been many exam

362
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:41,600
I have been ignoring that for quite a

363
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:51,080
while it's probably laughing later I'm

364
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,940
not gonna do live demo is a bad enough

365
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:57,680
let alone live update and it's been well

366
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:00,950
proven that many people believed in

367
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:04,250
taking short naps I we know famous

368
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:06,050
historical examples like Napoleon and

369
00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:08,180
Churchill I they're probably less

370
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:11,780
realistic people to look at but um I

371
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:13,640
used to work especially people from

372
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:15,500
countries like China and Japan are

373
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:19,430
amazing at just napping and if you've

374
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:20,839
ever been to any of those countries

375
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:22,750
you'll see people just having a nap and

376
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:25,820
I used to work with a guy in back in

377
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:27,050
Melbourne in Australia who would after

378
00:17:27,050 --> 00:17:28,640
lunch with the city's desk take a nap

379
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,640
and it's actually great view I can't do

380
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:34,220
it personally but it's great for your

381
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:36,770
brain it really invigorates you and

382
00:17:36,770 --> 00:17:39,470
again a lot of these bits of advice I'm

383
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:42,200
trying to give are reliant on being in a

384
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,940
workplace that will encourage and allow

385
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:46,010
you to do these things and not think oh

386
00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:47,510
my god they're sleeping on the job who

387
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:50,990
is this idiot but yeah but try it try

388
00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:54,400
some of these things meditation again I

389
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:59,900
I like kind of being uptight so I I

390
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:01,670
don't find meditation a very easy thing

391
00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:05,030
to do but I keep trying and I know it's

392
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:07,610
good for me but I'm not saying I do

393
00:18:07,610 --> 00:18:09,440
everything all these lists as I said

394
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:19,250
earlier this is alluding to again the

395
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:23,240
impact on your eyes of working late in

396
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:25,570
the dark just before you go to bed is

397
00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:28,820
sort of contentious but certainly we're

398
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:31,970
aware that being switched on wherever we

399
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:34,010
consider that just mental activity or

400
00:18:34,010 --> 00:18:36,220
literally switched on with the device

401
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:38,810
you should try to have about an hour

402
00:18:38,810 --> 00:18:42,250
before you go to sleep switched off and

403
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:46,220
and again something like a kindle for

404
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:49,310
reading still is shown to not be as good

405
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:52,010
as just reading a book and I understand

406
00:18:52,010 --> 00:18:54,050
we appreciate I travel a lot I

407
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:55,640
completely appreciate the convenience of

408
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:58,310
things like digital books but give it a

409
00:18:58,310 --> 00:19:00,710
go try it listen to some music or

410
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:03,470
something like that sleep is by far one

411
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:05,990
of the most important things to get

412
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:08,930
right without good sleep it affects

413
00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:10,820
pretty much all the other things we've

414
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:16,160
talked about now there we go I could see

415
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,660
why I doubt to what's coming next so

416
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:22,570
yeah all these things sleep helps so ah

417
00:19:22,570 --> 00:19:25,220
even a little bit of strangely it sounds

418
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:28,010
like a contradiction but doing some

419
00:19:28,010 --> 00:19:30,430
exercise before sleep can also help and

420
00:19:30,430 --> 00:19:32,900
he's again were from the NHS MIT plus

421
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:37,760
many others here's an interesting one

422
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,520
I've kind of gone off on a slight

423
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:42,320
tangent in terms of mental health saying

424
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,600
no learning to say no knowing your

425
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,730
limits knowing your boundaries it's

426
00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:48,650
often causes lots of the mental health

427
00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:50,900
in the first place especially in our

428
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:53,870
field this is a favorite phrase of a

429
00:19:53,870 --> 00:19:56,000
friend of mine I'll leave it up to you

430
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:01,070
to fill in the blanks and having clear

431
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:03,560
conversations and making sure we're not

432
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:06,440
assuming anything about anything can be

433
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:08,720
a good source of clearing up mental

434
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,940
stress in the long run if you don't have

435
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:14,270
time for a task in planning stand-ups

436
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:16,640
things like that say so I personally

437
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,140
feel like it's better to under-promise

438
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:19,820
and over-deliver than the other way

439
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:21,800
around if you don't understand something

440
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:25,040
ask no harm in it if you're

441
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:28,250
uncomfortable say so and we we read

442
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:29,780
event has a code of conduct that this

443
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:32,420
can also minimum or micro level we have

444
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:35,690
a problem say so don't let things sit

445
00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:40,430
and bubble under the surface now we come

446
00:20:40,430 --> 00:20:43,460
to diet because often when we're

447
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:45,260
stressed when we have mental health when

448
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:47,180
we're feeling down we overcompensate

449
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:51,170
with bad often eating drinking other

450
00:20:51,170 --> 00:20:55,250
things I really wanted to come up here

451
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:57,770
and say Club Marta is bad for you but

452
00:20:57,770 --> 00:20:59,170
actually isn't I was quite disappointed

453
00:20:59,170 --> 00:21:02,660
it's the caffeine is about the same as a

454
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:04,190
cup of coffee or the sugar is really low

455
00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:05,630
so keep drinking

456
00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:09,410
it's okay just not too many so we'll

457
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:14,150
leave that one alone pizza how many

458
00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:16,880
events do we go to where the catering is

459
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:19,130
pizza and pizza actually went down well

460
00:21:19,130 --> 00:21:20,930
with certain ingredients and not too

461
00:21:20,930 --> 00:21:23,120
much cheese not too much salt isn't too

462
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:25,700
bad but we can't guarantee that that's

463
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:27,800
what we're getting so you know

464
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,960
moderation I like a slice of pizza but

465
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:33,020
moderation or suggest to meetup

466
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:34,940
organizers they try something else more

467
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:38,570
of that later okay I thought this would

468
00:21:38,570 --> 00:21:45,530
make you love it really exists so whilst

469
00:21:45,530 --> 00:21:47,990
Marte is not too bad other energy drinks

470
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:52,190
are terrible Coca Cola Cola actually pre

471
00:21:52,190 --> 00:21:54,590
bad full of sugar full of all sorts of

472
00:21:54,590 --> 00:21:56,840
stuff and a lot of the labeling on them

473
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:59,240
is misleading as well often the

474
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,470
ingredients you don't even what they are

475
00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:04,250
so again in moderation everything in

476
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:07,100
moderation is ok but try not to have too

477
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:12,380
many mottos ok the alcohol I don't

478
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:13,880
really have to say much about the

479
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:16,580
negatives of alcohol we all know where

480
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:20,330
it can lead to when gone too far but we

481
00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:23,270
also know that in our space with meetups

482
00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:24,950
and certain offices is alcohol

483
00:22:24,950 --> 00:22:26,810
everywhere and especially in Germany

484
00:22:26,810 --> 00:22:30,110
it's cheap it's freely available Germans

485
00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:31,490
are actually pretty good with alcohol

486
00:22:31,490 --> 00:22:33,680
consumption comparison to I'm half

487
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:35,360
English half australian exposition I

488
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:39,440
cannot talk about alcohol but it's

489
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,150
always available and I love and often

490
00:22:41,150 --> 00:22:43,670
for free where we are where we work so

491
00:22:43,670 --> 00:22:46,040
you know be sensible now I'm going to do

492
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:55,470
a video next let's hope this works

493
00:22:55,480 --> 00:23:09,080
no see no okay all right this was if

494
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:10,730
anyone could recognize from this fuzzy

495
00:23:10,730 --> 00:23:15,140
image the IT crowd and where Jen takes

496
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:18,590
up smoking and in most countries in

497
00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:20,660
Western world there are public smoking

498
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:24,230
bans and smoking now feels like you're

499
00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:32,480
maligned Oh anyway so the likening isn't

500
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:40,760
now feeling like no okay too much beer

501
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:45,260
give the valium right I think it could

502
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:46,520
be like this most of time so I'll just

503
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:51,050
talk through it now smoking in most

504
00:23:51,050 --> 00:23:52,760
Western countries is sort of felt like

505
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:56,930
you're an outcast in Germany not so much

506
00:23:56,930 --> 00:24:00,440
but again we also know that smoking is

507
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,930
bad for us we don't have to you don't

508
00:24:02,930 --> 00:24:06,920
mean me to tell you that but moderation

509
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:10,610
again if you're stressed you might be

510
00:24:10,610 --> 00:24:12,740
smoking more try to solve the problems

511
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:14,420
of stress instead of just smoking more I

512
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:18,590
guess so here some things to try intact

513
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:20,630
instead of unhealthy snacks fruit in

514
00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:22,520
moderation this event has fruit I see

515
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:24,280
lots of other events have fruit is great

516
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:27,920
nuts nuts could be can be fatty and

517
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,420
maybe have too much energy so again in

518
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:30,950
moderation especially certain sorts of

519
00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:33,800
nuts and almonds almonds are terrible

520
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:36,160
for the environment so avoid those

521
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:38,090
especially they come from California

522
00:24:38,090 --> 00:24:39,920
which is a place we're all very familiar

523
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:43,970
with and being tech people and they use

524
00:24:43,970 --> 00:24:45,740
a lot of water in California is having

525
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:48,200
one of the worst droughts ever so avoid

526
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,690
almonds if you can for other reasons

527
00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:52,160
water water is actually quite a good

528
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:54,320
appetite suppressant if you're hungry so

529
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:57,590
smoking but see previous slide healthy

530
00:24:57,590 --> 00:24:59,870
snacks there's some solutions to this

531
00:24:59,870 --> 00:25:02,570
and I'm going to forward you shortly to

532
00:25:02,570 --> 00:25:04,990
someone who's far better expert on this

533
00:25:04,990 --> 00:25:08,180
cook together often when you go out and

534
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:08,600
eat

535
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:12,550
take away restaurants are often over

536
00:25:12,550 --> 00:25:15,620
salting seasoning putting extra fats et

537
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:19,250
cetera et cetera food was because really

538
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:21,710
why so cooking together at work is not

539
00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:23,810
only a good activity again to introduce

540
00:25:23,810 --> 00:25:25,970
that Mentos mental health positives but

541
00:25:25,970 --> 00:25:27,530
also you're controlling what's going in

542
00:25:27,530 --> 00:25:29,390
your food and you knowing what you're

543
00:25:29,390 --> 00:25:33,380
eating going for a walk it's a good

544
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:36,620
distraction if you're hungry and I like

545
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:44,030
walking so um thanks very much now

546
00:25:44,030 --> 00:25:48,370
there's something you know second oh

547
00:25:48,370 --> 00:25:52,220
