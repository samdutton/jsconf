00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:16,090
"YES, your site too can (and should) be accessible.

00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:26,190
Lessons learned from building FT.com"
Laura Carvajal

3
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:31,970
LAURA: Good morning, everyone.

4
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:38,050
I was in the audience for a talk on accessibility
a few years back much like you are right now,

5
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:43,589
and I was sitting with some colleagues from
a previous job and I remember feeling stuff

6
00:00:43,589 --> 00:00:49,489
like, well, this is really nice, really cool,
but does it really apply to the thing that

7
00:00:49,489 --> 00:00:50,489
I'm building?

8
00:00:50,489 --> 00:00:54,929
I was working on a mobile site at a time and
I kept hearing about all this keyboard stuff

9
00:00:54,929 --> 00:00:56,210
that I had to look into.

10
00:00:56,210 --> 00:00:58,799
So that didn't really matter to me.

11
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:03,199
And I thought, well, maybe we were starting
a new project, so it felt, like, there was

12
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:07,860
this huge gap between the thing that I was
building and accessibility.

13
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:12,110
And looking back, I'm honestly a little bit
embarrassed to admit this, but I also like

14
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:18,890
to full own having been there because it helps
me appreciate just how easy it is to feel

15
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:24,439
that way, and just how far accessibility can
be from the thing that you're doing.

16
00:01:24,439 --> 00:01:30,450
So fast forward to 2016, I was working at
the Financial Times, we were building the

17
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:33,689
fastest, greatest new site out there.

18
00:01:33,689 --> 00:01:35,549
We released that October.

19
00:01:35,549 --> 00:01:40,689
We replaced our old monolithic website and
it was a great success.

20
00:01:40,689 --> 00:01:42,369
We were winning all these awards.

21
00:01:42,369 --> 00:01:44,240
We were excelling at performance, security.

22
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:49,600
So basically every metric that we set out
to excel at, we were.

23
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:55,159
So one thing we decided to look at was accessibility,
thinking, well, we're great at all these things,

24
00:01:55,159 --> 00:01:58,890
maybe we're great at accessibility, too, just
magically.

25
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:06,240
But unlike performance and security, we hadn't
really put a collective effort into accessibility

26
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,580
so no surprise, we weren't very good.

27
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:13,920
And well, since this talk is about the lessons
we learned, that was really our first lesson.

28
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:19,940
Accessibility doesn't just happen; you have
to make it happen.

29
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:21,470
So my name is Laura Carahal.

30
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:30,610
And I work at the Financial Times.

31
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:34,300
And today I want to tell you about the lessons
we learned once we realized we had built this

32
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:38,500
beautiful performant thing that couldn't really
be used by everyone.

33
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:44,190
And so today, if you're in that clays you're
wondering if accessibility applies to your

34
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:51,120
project, I hope you walk away convinced that
it does and that's really easy to get started.

35
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,320
So what is accessibility?

36
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:57,610
Many definition out there but there's one
that I really, really like because it strips

37
00:02:57,610 --> 00:02:59,090
it down to its core.

38
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:04,130
It says: Web accessibility means that people
with disabilities can use the web.

39
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:05,130
That's it.

40
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:10,700
It just boils it down to not denying anyone
access to the thing that you're building.

41
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:14,080
To go beyond this a little bit, I want to
tell you a quick story.

42
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:18,680
I was in that shopping mall with my daughter
a few weeks back.

43
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:24,220
It's a modern shopping mall in London, Wimbley,
and we were going down that escalator down

44
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:25,220
there.

45
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:30,690
And she asked me, while we were going up,
how does someone in a wheelchair get to do

46
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:31,690
what we're doing?

47
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:37,200
And I told her, there's an elevator somewhere,
and as we're going up, she says, where is

48
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,200
it?

49
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,760
And to be honest, I couldn't see it.

50
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:45,270
It was only when we got to the top, that I
could see at the very long end of that hallway,

51
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:47,190
I pointed it out.

52
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:51,450
And she said, well, a person in a wheelchair
would have to go all the way there, and back,

53
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:54,590
that's not fair.

54
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:57,760
And children have a way of seeing things for
the way they are.

55
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:04,040
And so even though I explained regulations
and minimum things that you have to comply

56
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:07,190
with, she was totally not buying it, it was
not fair.

57
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:08,190
And that's the truth.

58
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:12,660
I mean, this was a modern building that met
all the requirements but you had that unfair

59
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:14,140
situation there.

60
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:20,070
So I'd like to say that accessibility goes
beyond not denying access; it's about ensuring

61
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:24,450
that the access that you provide is fair for
everyone and I'm giving my daughter full credit

62
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:26,880
for that quote.

63
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:30,750
So we've covered what accessibility is.

64
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:37,030
In terms of disability, it can be divided
into four categories: Physical, visual, hearing,

65
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:38,540
or cognitive.

66
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:45,220
These could be permanent disabilities but
we also have temporary and situational disabilities.

67
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:51,930
So, for example, if a permanent disability
is deaf and hard of hearing, a temporary disability

68
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:56,180
could be, in the dotted orange box there,
having an inner ear infection.

69
00:04:56,180 --> 00:05:02,210
So for a period of time, you can't hear very
well, or a situational disability is, you're

70
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:07,430
in a noisy place, and you can't hear things
because there's noise preventing you from

71
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:08,440
hearing.

72
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:16,420
So we designed something for someone deaf
in mind by adding, for example, closed captioning

73
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:22,260
to your videos, that benefits anyone else
that falls anywhere on that spectrum.

74
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:27,200
So getting back to permanent disabilities,
as far as permanent disabilities go, there's

75
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:37,410
about 1 billion people in the world with disabilities,
and when you factor in your own userbase and

76
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:42,050
their demographics, you can get a clearer
picture of what that number looks like for

77
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:43,670
your business.

78
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:48,389
So we did that at the Financial Times and
that worked out to be about 20% of our users

79
00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:55,260
because when you factor in the age distribution
of our readership, that tends to skew a little

80
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:56,260
bit older.

81
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:58,169
So we got a higher number there.

82
00:05:58,169 --> 00:06:02,460
So if you're anything like the FD, they have
a wide audience, consuming the products and

83
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:03,800
the services that you put out.

84
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:08,660
You probably go through great lengths, too,
to support all the members of that audience.

85
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:14,919
So, for example, you have people on IE 8 and
that only makes up about 5% of your userbase,

86
00:06:14,919 --> 00:06:18,370
you're probably making sure that they get
a good experience, or at least an acceptable

87
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:24,410
experience so all of a sudden, we have about
20% of our userbase that we're ignoring.

88
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:28,139
And that tends to get things moving.

89
00:06:28,139 --> 00:06:32,880
So that's a good motivation to get things
started.

90
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:37,900
So let's say I've convinced you now and you
were gonna do this.

91
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:43,400
You're determined to get accessibility into
your project, and it's hard, and it's overwhelming,

92
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,320
and you don't really know where to start.

93
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:49,400
Our suggestion is to just start small.

94
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:52,560
For us, starting small meant doing that.

95
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,930
We installed pa11y into our project.

96
00:06:54,930 --> 00:07:02,490
Pa11y is an open source tool that will check
your markup against some regulations I'll

97
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:06,570
show you in a little bit and it can detect
some accessibility errors.

98
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:10,610
It doesn't detect everything but it's a good
place to start.

99
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:15,860
There are other open source tools that do
the same thing but we've found pa11y to be

100
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:22,900
a great thing for our project, and it has
a great community of members and developers

101
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:23,900
around it.

102
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:27,150
So this was the way that we started.

103
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:34,150
So the way pa11y works is it goes through
the web content accessibility guidelines.

104
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:38,190
We won't go very deep into this today but
you can go and check it out.

105
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:42,620
It's a list of criteria that your site should
meet if it is to be accessible.

106
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:47,010
So it checks your markup against that, and
then it gives you a report of what's broken.

107
00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:53,590
And so we ran pa11y against ft.com, and we
got a whole list of errors that was a lot

108
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:55,640
more than two at the time.

109
00:07:55,640 --> 00:08:00,840
And at that moment, we could just go and fix
the errors, and run this every now and then

110
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:06,291
manually, and then fix things that come up,
but unless we had something that we could

111
00:08:06,291 --> 00:08:10,050
automate into our build process, this wasn't
going to be very efficient.

112
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:16,979
So pa11y has sort of a wrapper that's called
pa11y-ci, that just helps you to wrap pa11y

113
00:08:16,979 --> 00:08:20,740
into your continual process.

114
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:23,229
So this is what we did in FT.

115
00:08:23,229 --> 00:08:31,300
This is an overall simplified version of our
Node process.

116
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:35,659
So one app would be the opportunity page,
or the article page, or sign-up pages.

117
00:08:35,659 --> 00:08:38,349
And those apps live on GitHub.

118
00:08:38,349 --> 00:08:44,509
Every time we push to a branch in GitHub,
that kicks off a CircleCI build, and if it's

119
00:08:44,509 --> 00:08:50,240
a master branch, then it goes to Heroku and
it's off to production.

120
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:55,800
So pa11y kicks in here, in the continuous
integration step.

121
00:08:55,800 --> 00:09:01,040
So it would run for every push for every branch
for your project and it would tell you what

122
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,540
accessibility errors you have.

123
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:11,790
So to do that, we just need it to add one
line to our existing build process which is

124
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:13,410
.make pa11y.

125
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:19,269
And really, what that does is run pa11y-ci
and it's highly customizable.

126
00:09:19,269 --> 00:09:27,389
And so in our case, every branch generates
a dynamic app with a dynamic name and so we

127
00:09:27,389 --> 00:09:28,920
run pa11y-ci against that.

128
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:32,779
And the interesting thing here is the threshold
amount.

129
00:09:32,779 --> 00:09:40,290
So, at the time, we've had dozens of apps
making up ft.com and we had hundreds of errors.

130
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:44,829
So we couldn't just, one day, break every
build, and hold production and say, hey, we

131
00:09:44,829 --> 00:09:47,149
need to fix all these errors.

132
00:09:47,149 --> 00:09:52,920
So what that allows you to do is integrate
pa11y to not break your builds, and so your

133
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:55,029
builds will pass.

134
00:09:55,029 --> 00:09:59,660
So you initially set that value to something
very high.

135
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:05,399
You'll still have builds pass, and no one
will have builds failing because of it.

136
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:11,329
But you'll have a report now of the accessibility
errors that you have.

137
00:10:11,329 --> 00:10:21,769
So once we did that, we went, app-by-app,
cleaning up the errors, and then we would

138
00:10:21,769 --> 00:10:23,320
remove the threshold argument.

139
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:29,110
So for that moment, if a new branch included
a new accessibility error, then that branch

140
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:30,110
wouldn't pass.

141
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:32,209
And so that was sort of our ultimate goal.

142
00:10:32,209 --> 00:10:35,069
So it would look like that.

143
00:10:35,069 --> 00:10:40,649
So now you've reached kind of like a zero-error
level, and now that has a new branch, it has

144
00:10:40,649 --> 00:10:44,129
a new error and you can't push that to production.

145
00:10:44,129 --> 00:10:49,449
So that was a big achievement and we were
getting to the point where all of our apps

146
00:10:49,449 --> 00:10:50,449
had this.

147
00:10:50,449 --> 00:10:53,629
They all had zero errors and they were preventing
making new errors into production.

148
00:10:53,629 --> 00:10:55,389
And that was a big deal.

149
00:10:55,389 --> 00:10:58,019
We felt like winners.

150
00:10:58,019 --> 00:11:02,059
No accessibility errors would ever make it
to production.

151
00:11:02,059 --> 00:11:08,480
But we realized that even though everyone
was for accessibility, they all liked the

152
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:13,690
idea of pa11y, they even liked having the
idea of having pa11y break their build.

153
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:19,369
We didn't really do a great job of explaining
what once you got that list of errors, or

154
00:11:19,369 --> 00:11:21,499
what that meant, or what you were supposed
to do.

155
00:11:21,499 --> 00:11:24,029
So that was a lesson learned.

156
00:11:24,029 --> 00:11:31,089
So before you set a project on fire, train
people.

157
00:11:31,089 --> 00:11:40,379
So a good place to start is this free Udacity
course.

158
00:11:40,379 --> 00:11:44,459
But this is a great tutorial that you can
at your own pace and this is where we started

159
00:11:44,459 --> 00:11:50,350
our own training.

160
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:55,699
So we've reached that level where you have
zero errors in your app, or in all your apps.

161
00:11:55,699 --> 00:12:00,259
You've removed that threshold argument and
nothing's going to make it into production.

162
00:12:00,259 --> 00:12:05,709
So now we've talked about errors that you
can detect automatically in pa11y.

163
00:12:05,709 --> 00:12:13,999
So that's about 20-35% of all the errors that
you can and at least needs to be checked manually.

164
00:12:13,999 --> 00:12:18,989
And so to do that is you can do some things.

165
00:12:18,989 --> 00:12:25,939
One of them is getting an external audit where
a third party with experience in accessibility

166
00:12:25,939 --> 00:12:30,779
checks your site and tells you -- gives you
a report of what's broken, or certifies you

167
00:12:30,779 --> 00:12:33,700
that you have no errors and that you are accessible.

168
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:38,680
Something else that you can do is have customer
research or do user testing and the third

169
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:45,149
one is learning how to use assistive tech
yourself so you can test your own site and

170
00:12:45,149 --> 00:12:46,269
spot some of these errors.

171
00:12:46,269 --> 00:12:50,130
These are not mutually exclusive, and ideally
you should be doing all of them.

172
00:12:50,130 --> 00:12:54,149
So I'm going to go through each of these.

173
00:12:54,149 --> 00:13:00,220
In our case, the external audit was conducted
by the Digital Accessibility Center, and I'm

174
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:08,110
going to show you a little video of what they
did.

175
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:14,229
>> My name is Jebec Morgan, and I have cerebral
palsy.

176
00:13:14,229 --> 00:13:18,069
>> Choose three.

177
00:13:18,069 --> 00:13:21,909
>> Click button.

178
00:13:21,909 --> 00:13:27,899
>> It controls the videos.

179
00:13:27,899 --> 00:13:31,109
>> My name is James Herkain, and I'm the color
contrast and disability analyst at --

180
00:13:31,109 --> 00:13:38,369
>> On the home page, I encountered some text
displayed on top of images.

181
00:13:38,369 --> 00:13:43,220
Text displayed on top of images could be very
difficult to read because of the varying contrast.

182
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:47,519
>> I'm a web analyst at DOC.

183
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:51,489
I test zoom test with audible feedback.

184
00:13:51,489 --> 00:13:57,970
And I'm going to scroll down below and just
test this.

185
00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:05,049
>> My opinion, Morgan's companies, world,
home.

186
00:14:05,049 --> 00:14:12,509
>> So there's an empty space here which would
be an ideal place to put the subheading.

187
00:14:12,509 --> 00:14:20,209
>> My name is Charles Brew, and I'm at -- there's
a moving image that extracts me from all the

188
00:14:20,209 --> 00:14:21,209
content.

189
00:14:21,209 --> 00:14:27,819
Another issue that I've found on the home
page is the carousel.

190
00:14:27,819 --> 00:14:34,179
When navigating through it, I couldn't find
the arrow to navigate to each page.

191
00:14:34,179 --> 00:14:43,819
And once I found that, eventually finding
the other previous button was difficult.

192
00:14:43,819 --> 00:14:51,399
>> Hello there, my name is Mike Jones and
I'm completely blind and I'm an accessibility

193
00:14:51,399 --> 00:14:54,959
analyst at the Digital Accessibility Center.

194
00:14:54,959 --> 00:15:01,649
On one of the articles that I've tested, there
were several headings that announces read

195
00:15:01,649 --> 00:15:02,800
more.

196
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:07,060
And these also interrupt the article.

197
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:10,189
It's not clear what the user should be reading
more about.

198
00:15:10,189 --> 00:15:15,329
Actually these headings interrupt the main
article that the user is reading.

199
00:15:15,329 --> 00:15:21,420
So it would have been helpful to me, to ensure
that the article read smoothly and continuously

200
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:22,649
without interruptions.

201
00:15:22,649 --> 00:15:26,429
LAURA: Yeah, so that's some of the work that
they did.

202
00:15:26,429 --> 00:15:31,149
This is only two minutes long but I was lucky
enough to be able to spend a day -- a full

203
00:15:31,149 --> 00:15:33,569
day -- with them while they were doing the
testing.

204
00:15:33,569 --> 00:15:37,199
And if you have a chance to do this for the
product that you're building, I highly recommend

205
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:42,249
it because it will change your perspective
on the work that you do forever.

206
00:15:42,249 --> 00:15:49,610
So after that, all of that testing, we got
a report back with about -- it was, like,

207
00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:54,449
a 200-page report giving us all the errors
that we had -- all the stuff that they had

208
00:15:54,449 --> 00:15:55,730
to detect manually.

209
00:15:55,730 --> 00:15:57,489
So we went about fixing all of those.

210
00:15:57,489 --> 00:16:00,559
It took us a couple of months.

211
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:05,019
And just very recently we got an accreditation
saying that this website is accessible to

212
00:16:05,019 --> 00:16:10,410
this level of conformance and we were very
glad to get it because it was very hard work

213
00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:17,859
and we were also very glad to be the first
site in our industry to get it, but this is

214
00:16:17,859 --> 00:16:20,420
not a title that we want to hold alone.

215
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:25,319
So we encourage people from The Guardian,
and The Post, and The Times, to get on this

216
00:16:25,319 --> 00:16:32,879
because this is one metric that we should
all be trying to outdo each other on.

217
00:16:32,879 --> 00:16:41,600
So another problem is customer research.

218
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:47,300
But if you want your new features to make
sense, they should probably be tested by actual

219
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:51,570
users, or you could end up, you know, building
something that looks good on paper but still

220
00:16:51,570 --> 00:16:55,370
get it very, very wrong.

221
00:16:55,370 --> 00:17:01,629
So lastly, here I wanted to talk a little
bit about how we went about learning how to

222
00:17:01,629 --> 00:17:03,699
use assistive tech ourselves.

223
00:17:03,699 --> 00:17:05,939
We had never done that before as a team.

224
00:17:05,939 --> 00:17:09,690
So this is one thing that you can do for free
and I would highly encourage it.

225
00:17:09,690 --> 00:17:11,110
This is some of the tools we use.

226
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:13,699
You can get them all for free if you have
a Mac.

227
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:20,139
We used VoiceOver for screenreader.

228
00:17:20,139 --> 00:17:24,549
And we used the zoom capabilities of the Mac.

229
00:17:24,549 --> 00:17:27,760
We tested a little bit on Windows as well
because they have this high-contrast mode

230
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,429
that just breaks everything.

231
00:17:29,429 --> 00:17:34,049
So it's a lot worse than the Mac one, and
by worse I mean a lot better because it finds

232
00:17:34,049 --> 00:17:39,159
more errors so if you have access to Windows,
I would highly recommend looking at what you're

233
00:17:39,159 --> 00:17:41,882
looking at with that build on that mode.

234
00:17:41,882 --> 00:17:48,520
So one thing that really helped us a lot was
testing keyboard only.

235
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:53,370
So initially we would just go to ft.com and
just test the site using the keyboard and

236
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:57,169
then go about our lives and using our mouse,
or our trackpad.

237
00:17:57,169 --> 00:18:01,799
But what really made a difference was going
keyboard only all the time.

238
00:18:01,799 --> 00:18:09,520
So one thing you learn is you can use keyboard
only on sites because they are good with keyboard

239
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:10,520
accessibility.

240
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:16,120
But there are some sites that are impossible
to use, and that becomes evident very quickly

241
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:21,350
once you give up your house or your trackpad.

242
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:27,649
So to be able to make the transition easier
from using a trackpad, to a keyboard is by

243
00:18:27,649 --> 00:18:30,620
using mouse keys.

244
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:37,060
So what that can do is disable your trackpad
but it gives you the possibility to control

245
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:39,649
your pointer with your number keys.

246
00:18:39,649 --> 00:18:41,690
So you can use that in an emergency.

247
00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:47,179
So if you have a site that has particularly
bad accessibility, and you don't have a mouse,

248
00:18:47,179 --> 00:18:54,180
instead of using the mouse or a trackpad,
you can -- so it's really annoying.

249
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:59,330
And really only want to use it when there's
no other way.

250
00:18:59,330 --> 00:19:05,620
So one thing we realize is convenient before
you go keyboard only is printing out some

251
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:07,279
of the shortcuts for your top apps.

252
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:09,929
This was my setup around November.

253
00:19:09,929 --> 00:19:15,389
But once you do this for a while, and you
just memorize the shortcuts by using them,

254
00:19:15,389 --> 00:19:19,139
and all that paper goes away.

255
00:19:19,139 --> 00:19:22,260
Sometimes I don't have an external keyboard
when I take my laptop home, for example.

256
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:26,900
So what I've done is I've made my trackpad
really, really slow and I've removed all the

257
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:32,139
goodies that Apple gave me so that when I
do have to use it, it's uncomfortable so it

258
00:19:32,139 --> 00:19:35,590
reminds me to go back and use the keyboard.

259
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:39,990
So that's lesson number three: Throw away
your mouse.

260
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:45,970
So going back to that list of things that
you have to fix, you've learned to use all

261
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:46,970
these tools.

262
00:19:46,970 --> 00:19:47,970
You have your keyboard set up.

263
00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:52,820
It's really tempting to just roll up your
sleeves and try to fix everything yourself,

264
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:57,960
but if you're building a large site, I'd recommend
you don't do that.

265
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:01,240
So it's -- wait, let's go back to Jim Carrey
for a minute.

266
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:06,840
So one thing that we learned -- or that I
learned -- it wasn't that quickly, it took

267
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:13,750
a while, was that if you try and take on everything
yourself, it's not efficient, it's not the

268
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:14,890
right answer.

269
00:20:14,890 --> 00:20:20,340
You end up burning out, errors keep coming
back in faster than you can clean it up and

270
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:24,169
you really do a disservice to your team by
becoming a bottleneck.

271
00:20:24,169 --> 00:20:29,779
So what you can do here is just get everyone
involved.

272
00:20:29,779 --> 00:20:35,780
A lot of people -- almost everyone -- everyone
I know really wants to be a part of this,

273
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:40,429
and wants to help, and they can only do that
if you let them know that you need to help,

274
00:20:40,429 --> 00:20:42,460
that you're doing this, and how they can help.

275
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:45,090
Just give them tools to do this.

276
00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:51,230
So if you do have some time, just spend some
of it training your team and getting them

277
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:54,930
involved rather than just trying to fix everything
yourself.

278
00:20:54,930 --> 00:20:57,880
Also make it part of your recruitment process
if you can.

279
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:01,870
Make it part of your job description, of your
online tests, just put it out there.

280
00:21:01,870 --> 00:21:09,580
So that was lesson number four for us: Don't
take it all out on yourself.

281
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:12,330
Another good way to spread the word is making
an event out of it.

282
00:21:12,330 --> 00:21:17,220
We put together a road show in the office
where we set some laptops in the middle of

283
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:23,440
the office and we invited everyone to just
try to complete a form using a screenreader.

284
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:26,070
And we offered an Amazon gift card as a prize.

285
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:30,220
So it was, like, a $20 Amazon gift card but
people love Amazon so everyone stopped by.

286
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:34,750
So this was a form that you had to fill out.

287
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:38,460
So you can't really easy that much, and you're
forced on using the screenreader to do it.

288
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:41,870
And a lot of people who stopped by, this was
the first time of of them using a screenreader.

289
00:21:41,870 --> 00:21:45,340
Some of them didn't even know what a screenreader
was.

290
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:49,890
So this was a great way to expose a lot of
people at the same time to accessibility.

291
00:21:49,890 --> 00:21:51,880
So that's what the form is.

292
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:57,490
It's a very simple form with some annoying
menu items if you don't skip them properly.

293
00:21:57,490 --> 00:22:00,120
And it had some accessibility built in.

294
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:05,440
And the way that we did that was just very
crudely blurred things, and disabling clicks,

295
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:09,190
and discouraging people, saying not to cheat.

296
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:17,601
But this event that we held was probably a
highlight in my 15 years of doing this.

297
00:22:17,601 --> 00:22:18,601
Is this moment.

298
00:22:18,601 --> 00:22:30,259
That's Patrick Hammond, you probably know
him, a seasoned developer, and Patrick, I

299
00:22:30,259 --> 00:22:35,639
apologize, I'm going to use that for the rest
of the year as I talk about this.

300
00:22:35,639 --> 00:22:40,020
We got that type of reaction from a lot of
people, and it was really great because we

301
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:45,610
managed to create a space of collective empathy
within these 20 minutes or so that people

302
00:22:45,610 --> 00:22:47,530
did this.

303
00:22:47,530 --> 00:22:51,820
We had all these people just stepping into
someone else's shoes for a minute or two at

304
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:57,980
a time but everyone walked away with a new
perspective on how people really use the product

305
00:22:57,980 --> 00:23:00,330
that they were building.

306
00:23:00,330 --> 00:23:04,809
So that was lesson number five: Talk about
it a lot.

307
00:23:04,809 --> 00:23:05,809
Make sure you spread the word.

308
00:23:05,809 --> 00:23:09,840
You never know who's listening and you're
probably inspiring more people than you think

309
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:12,140
you are.

310
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:16,200
Before we finish, I wanted to take you back
to how they really all got started for us

311
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,200
at the FT.

312
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:23,411
I was in book duty one day and I noticed this
card on our JIRA board for bug duty.

313
00:23:23,411 --> 00:23:31,510
Bug duty is the only place on our JIRA board.

314
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:32,890
It said integrate pa11y.

315
00:23:32,890 --> 00:23:34,490
I didn't know what pa11y was.

316
00:23:34,490 --> 00:23:40,290
And when I picked up that card expect and
when saw the card, I noticed that it had been

317
00:23:40,290 --> 00:23:46,980
sitting around for a long time, I saw that
Ben Fletcher created it.

318
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:56,659
And he's a developer who's deaf-blind and
he just made us aware that that is something

319
00:23:56,659 --> 00:23:59,480
that we should be looking at.

320
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:08,700
So that's the next point, diversity will improve
the team, it will improve you.

321
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:15,730
Ben's actions really snowballed into us building
a better product.

322
00:24:15,730 --> 00:24:21,529
Our team learned about accessibility and got
a new perspective, and just grew as a team.

323
00:24:21,529 --> 00:24:26,409
And it led to me standing in front of you
all here today.

324
00:24:26,409 --> 00:24:32,080
So to recap, just the things that you learned,
and probably some things that you can do tonight

325
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,600
in half an hour.

326
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,169
Accessibility doesn't just happen.

327
00:24:36,169 --> 00:24:41,000
You can do that in one minute in your project,
if you make pa11y-ci as a part of your build

328
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:46,269
process with a high threshold, and start getting
reports of your accessibility errors.

329
00:24:46,269 --> 00:24:48,440
Number two, train your people.

330
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:54,980
One good way is you could share that Udacity
course with your colleagues, that's very quick.

331
00:24:54,980 --> 00:25:00,549
Throw away your mouse but I do suggest printing
out shortcuts beforehand.

332
00:25:00,549 --> 00:25:05,409
Don't throw it to yourself.

333
00:25:05,409 --> 00:25:08,910
Get people, get designers, QA, get product
involved.

334
00:25:08,910 --> 00:25:09,910
Talk about it.

335
00:25:09,910 --> 00:25:10,910
Go on Twitter.

336
00:25:10,910 --> 00:25:14,799
There's a lot of fantastic people out there
with great insights on accessibility.

337
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:18,730
I'll share some links at the end of this talk.

338
00:25:18,730 --> 00:25:22,899
So, yeah, just go over the Twitter feeds and
see what they're talking about.

339
00:25:22,899 --> 00:25:25,799
Retweet that you find interesting, something
that inspires you.

340
00:25:25,799 --> 00:25:27,390
That can be done very quickly.

341
00:25:27,390 --> 00:25:31,361
And the last one, I unfortunately, don't have
a magic silver bullet but you can do it in

342
00:25:31,361 --> 00:25:34,730
30 seconds in your work.

343
00:25:34,730 --> 00:25:43,220
But if you're involved in hiring, try to prioritize
it, and if not, make it a thing that you talk

344
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:50,200
about it, but it really benefits all those
things that we just talked about.

345
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:56,299
A while back, it was probably normal to have
this be the only entrance to a public building

346
00:25:56,299 --> 00:25:57,610
somewhere.

347
00:25:57,610 --> 00:26:00,540
Now it would be unthinkable to have this.

348
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:05,440
But don't wait until it becomes unthinkable
to have inaccessible websites.

349
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:08,720
The time to make your website accessible is
today.

350
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:09,720
So just do it.

351
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:10,720
Thank you.

352
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:11,720
>> Thank you so much.

353
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:12,720
That was an excellent talk on why accessibility
is so important.

354
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:13,720
Also how blind we are to how other people
might be using the web.

355
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:14,720
It's a super important space to work in and,
yeah, thank you, again, to Laura.

356
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:15,720
We will be moving on to the next talk by Ruth.

357
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:16,720
And as y'all know there's also a second track.

358
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:17,720
We have talk by Jessica Tran, Hacking My Anxiety
with Open Source Technology.

359
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:18,720
So if you're interested in that, that's going
to be starting in five minutes, as well.

360
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:19,720
So who's interested in making an interactive
visual cool stuff happen with the web?

361
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:20,720
People into this.

362
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:21,720
Yeah, absolutely!

363
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:22,720
We're doing a lot of visual stuff that people
can access visually, and there's a lot of

364
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:23,720
space in the web area to do that.

365
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:24,720
And as a warning, there are going to be flashing
lights in this presentation, so anybody sensitive

366
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:25,720
to that, just to be aware.

367
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:26,720
And there's also going to be some sound playing.

368
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:27,720
And also with the accessibility talk, I really
like the term "spaces of empathy."

369
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:28,720
I think this is a really great term to talk
about being empathic with people and creating

370
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:29,720
a situation in which you can be empathic because
it's easy to lose that.

371
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:30,720
Do we have any, like, audio-visual artists
out there attending?

372
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:31,720
The setup looks really exciting.

373
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:32,720
I can't wait to see it.

374
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:33,720
Also, I'll bring this up again, but in the
Community Lounge, there's going to be talks

375
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:34,720
during the break, and also some of our sponsors
have workshops going on.

376
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:35,720
For example, I know the Mozilla table is going
to have a rust workshop if anybody is into

377
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:36,720
that, and later on, another one.

378
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:37,720
So make sure you check out those tables.

379
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:38,720
There's going to be stuff going on.

380
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,720
I'll bring it up again later when we go for
lunch.
