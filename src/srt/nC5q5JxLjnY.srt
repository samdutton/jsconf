00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:20,320
Welcome to my talk, recreating retro computer
Art with JavaScript.

2
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,780
And my name is Sher Minn.

3
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:28,980
It's a little bit of an unusual name.

4
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:32,930
Downside is online forums don't like it when
you have a space in your name.

5
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:37,530
I'll be here working on clientside validation,
keep that in mind.

6
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:40,470
On the bright side, my SEO is really great.

7
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:44,320
If you look up my name, it's the first result
and I didn't have to do anything.

8
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,400
So, life is good.

9
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:50,880
I am from a small country in southeast Asia
called Malaysia.

10
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:52,620
And yeah.

11
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:57,239
We have actually another Malaysian in the
house here that was on the stage at CSSconf.

12
00:00:57,239 --> 00:00:59,930
Proud to represent my country.

13
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:05,350
And I live in New York right now where I initially
moved to attend something called the recurse

14
00:01:05,350 --> 00:01:06,350
Center.

15
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:08,670
RC in the house.

16
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:17,230
For those who don't know what the recurse
Center, it's based in New York City for programmers.

17
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:23,900
6, 8 or 12 weeks and you can rediscover can
the joy in programming.

18
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:28,200
If you want to take time to learn something
you have been meaning to learn, this is a

19
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,130
great place to do it.

20
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:34,850
And I plug it because this is the reason why
I'm giving this talk here today.

21
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:40,430
Everything they have provided me has enabled
me to pursue creative programming.

22
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:43,220
Creative programming.

23
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:46,060
I like art a lot.

24
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:49,509
I learned thousand draw before I learned how
to code.

25
00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:52,520
Here are some of the pieces of work that I've
made in the past year.

26
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:55,970
And I really enjoy using programming to create
code.

27
00:01:55,970 --> 00:02:00,020
And most recently I have been really inspired
by retro computer art.

28
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:06,979
So, what happened was that I discovered this
magazine from 1976 to 1978.

29
00:02:06,979 --> 00:02:12,639
And it was edited by a computer artist, Gracie
Hertlein based in California in the United

30
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:13,639
States.

31
00:02:13,639 --> 00:02:18,120
This was the first ever computer magazine
entirely dedicated to computer graphics and

32
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,120
art.

33
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:26,260
You can see the title, inexpensive graphics
in the storage category, really dates it.

34
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:30,200
And I got these images from a website called
the recode project.com.

35
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,930
The site is no longer up.

36
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:37,659
But it was a great resource to look through
what was cutting edge graphics back then.

37
00:02:37,659 --> 00:02:42,340
And as you can see, it's mostly black and
white, textbased, lines, geometric shapes.

38
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:46,709
Today we would call it minimalist or Lofi
as an esthetic.

39
00:02:46,709 --> 00:02:54,599
It was fun to look at and think about because
most of the times the work published is just

40
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:56,260
the artwork itself.

41
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:58,400
There wasn't a lot of algorithms.

42
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,739
Most of the time there would be some description
of the technology used and maybe some of the

43
00:03:02,739 --> 00:03:04,559
techniques, but no actual algorithms.

44
00:03:04,559 --> 00:03:09,879
So, the whole purpose of the website that
posted this magazine, the archive for this

45
00:03:09,879 --> 00:03:13,540
magazine were like, can we try to reverse
engineer it.

46
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:18,529
Can we look at a piece and figure out how
it was made?

47
00:03:18,529 --> 00:03:22,629
And so, this exactly what I sort of fell into.

48
00:03:22,629 --> 00:03:29,069
And so, this entire talk will be about the
research that I did and also some of the attempts

49
00:03:29,069 --> 00:03:31,959
at recreating these works.

50
00:03:31,959 --> 00:03:33,459
Let's first talk about computer art.

51
00:03:33,459 --> 00:03:34,529
What is computer art?

52
00:03:34,529 --> 00:03:38,089
A lot of us have an idea what have computer
art is.

53
00:03:38,089 --> 00:03:39,379
It's probably right.

54
00:03:39,379 --> 00:03:51,129
In my definition, computer art is the art
that computers play a part in the creation

55
00:03:51,129 --> 00:03:53,200
of the artwork.

56
00:03:53,200 --> 00:04:02,159
That's using Photoshop or Illustrator or 3D
graphics, AR, VR, the latest hottest thing,

57
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,900
deep learning art, AI art.

58
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:07,339
But we're not talking about that today.

59
00:04:07,339 --> 00:04:11,709
We're going it be talking about the really,
really early years of computer graphics.

60
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:18,169
This is when computer graphics became accessible
and it will be about how people took those

61
00:04:18,169 --> 00:04:21,009
technologies and used it to make art.

62
00:04:21,009 --> 00:04:25,370
So, the decade I'm focusing on is the 1950s
it 1970s.

63
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:30,560
This was really the crucial part where computer
art was just becoming a thing.

64
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,580
So, everything's in black and white.

65
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:39,090
So, to talk about retro computer art, we first
need to talk about what computers were like

66
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:40,820
back then.

67
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:44,979
The reason being that context really matter
when is you're talking about history.

68
00:04:44,979 --> 00:04:49,490
And if you understand the tools and the techniques
that are available to people at the time,

69
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:54,520
you can understand why certain pieces had
a certain esthetic or, you know, why was it

70
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,520
done that way.

71
00:04:55,520 --> 00:05:00,470
It helps you appreciate a lot of the work
a little bit better.

72
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:03,699
Here is a computer that was introduced in
1959.

73
00:05:03,699 --> 00:05:07,080
This is the IBM7099 data processing system.

74
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:09,030
Not just a computer, a data processing system.

75
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:10,050
Really fancy.

76
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:11,289
It would take up the entire room.

77
00:05:11,289 --> 00:05:17,150
You can see the magnetic tape readers at the
back, console and punch card readers.

78
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:22,360
And it was introduced at a really cool price
of $3 million.

79
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,370
Back then.

80
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:28,729
If you converted it to currency today counting
for inflation it would be something like $19

81
00:05:28,729 --> 00:05:33,639
million US which is really, really expensive.

82
00:05:33,639 --> 00:05:36,860
What this meant was that computer were really
difficult to come by.

83
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:43,449
The people who could afford it were in universities,
research labs, the military, government agencies.

84
00:05:43,449 --> 00:05:46,389
They are very scarce as a resource.

85
00:05:46,389 --> 00:05:51,680
Can you imagine calling IBM up and saying
I would like to buy a computer for $19 million.

86
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,620
I'll write you a check, you know?

87
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:59,770
And most of the time people wouldn't interface
with the computer.

88
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:05,960
They would write programs for it using a punch
card writing like a typewriter.

89
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:09,599
And you punch the code and punch it into a
punch card.

90
00:06:09,599 --> 00:06:15,250
Take the stack of punch cards and hand it
to a little old man behind the door and you

91
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:17,350
would get the results back five minutes later.

92
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:21,930
If you get impatient waiting for Webpack to
building with think of this.

93
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:27,310
It takes a lot of time.

94
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:32,580
And there were many uses for scientific and
mathematical applications mostly by scientists

95
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:35,400
or mathematicians in research labs or, you
know, universities.

96
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:42,240
So, I want to show you some examples of companies
that really converted to the field of computer

97
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,240
graphics.

98
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:48,199
The first coined the term computer graphics
and they were one of the first few people

99
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:51,490
to use computer graphics in design work.

100
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:58,090
They used it to design cockpits to animate
the different reaches of the limbs for the

101
00:06:58,090 --> 00:06:59,270
pilot in the cockpit.

102
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:00,270
Simulations.

103
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:06,150
Here was the first airport that was made using
computer graphics, the Seattle Tacoma Airport

104
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:08,740
in the United States.

105
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:18,909
And Bell Labs in the US, they made one of
the first ever computergenerated films.

106
00:07:18,909 --> 00:07:24,610
First what that might look like and then I'm
going to show it to you.

107
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:32,090
Here it is, it is a simulation of a control
system from 1963.

108
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:33,789
And it's supercute.

109
00:07:33,789 --> 00:07:38,099
It's a satellite revolving around a planet.

110
00:07:38,099 --> 00:07:44,280
The early graphics were mostly designed to
model or maybe just, you know, demonstrate

111
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,280
some diagrams.

112
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:49,529
And so, like this really simple graph of straight
lines, geometric shapes, black and white,

113
00:07:49,529 --> 00:07:52,210
that was sufficient for their purposes.

114
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:53,759
This is wonderful.

115
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:58,169
No fancy colors or gradients or anything like
that.

116
00:07:58,169 --> 00:07:59,759
And yet, you know, art happened anyway.

117
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:03,620
People look the limited technology they had
and did something really wonderful with it.

118
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:07,680
So, I'm going to talk about three different
types of art.

119
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:11,669
I just chose examples from each category.

120
00:08:11,669 --> 00:08:17,629
And I'll show you some oscilloscope art, some
graphics and some textbased art and my attempts

121
00:08:17,629 --> 00:08:18,699
at recreating them.

122
00:08:18,699 --> 00:08:21,180
Let's start with oscilloscope art.

123
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:23,439
So, cathode ray oscilloscopes.

124
00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:28,009
If you have been in a lab or school, played
with one.

125
00:08:28,009 --> 00:08:33,360
And this is what an oscilloscope is, or this
is what it looked like in the 1950s.

126
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:40,071
It is a device that takes electrical signals
and converts them into a visual over here.

127
00:08:40,071 --> 00:08:44,610
So, here we have an example of a sine wave
on an oscilloscope.

128
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:48,630
This is like a little bit before, you know,
the IBM7090.

129
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:55,990
And here on the left is a picture of Ben Laposky,
credited to be one of the first few people

130
00:08:55,990 --> 00:08:59,960
who created electronic graphics.

131
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:05,550
And so, what I mean by that is he would plot
interesting patterns on so the oscilloscope

132
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:10,140
and he would then photograph them and here
is some of his works.

133
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:13,710
And what's really interesting about them is
they look really ghostly.

134
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:14,870
Really kind of organic a way.

135
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:18,230
But you can sort of tell they had this sort
of mathematical quality to it.

136
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:21,199
A few more.

137
00:09:21,199 --> 00:09:27,339
Around the same time actually in Europe also
there was a movement getting started in computer

138
00:09:27,339 --> 00:09:28,339
art.

139
00:09:28,339 --> 00:09:33,260
Herbert W. Franke, we created his own electronic
artwork using oscilloscopes.

140
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:35,020
Here is some of his work.

141
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:40,610
So, the interesting thing to note about this,
oscilloscopes don't have a screenshot button.

142
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:43,269
You don't press screenshot, and this is going
to come out.

143
00:09:43,269 --> 00:09:48,920
So, in order to capture these images, what
they would do is set the camera in front of

144
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:52,980
the screen and leave it on long exposure.

145
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:57,730
It captures the movement of lines and graphics
on the screen.

146
00:09:57,730 --> 00:10:00,180
What you're seeing here is not just a single
snapshot.

147
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:05,790
It is a combination of events on a screen
over time.

148
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:10,190
And so, here actually is an example of the
same like event, but two different phases

149
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:12,370
of it.

150
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:16,279
And I think it looks really beautiful like
a ghostly jelly fish.

151
00:10:16,279 --> 00:10:20,209
And more works by him.

152
00:10:20,209 --> 00:10:28,480
And how to do this, draw sine waves on an
oscilloscope.

153
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:31,519
But how to get from that to that?

154
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:41,500
There was a little bit of an explanation in
recreational math mat irks and he used the

155
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:47,980
sine waves and others in combination.

156
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:52,750
Applying operations to create composite waves
that had really interesting patterns.

157
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:57,920
Here is an example of the work that makes
is really obvious that there is a bit of a

158
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:01,360
sine wave thing going on.

159
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,410
And I was like, how okay.

160
00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:06,170
I get it.

161
00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:09,630
But how well, how are these really made?

162
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:11,070
I attempted to create it.

163
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:17,230
I'm going to show you a demo here of creation
of Lapsoky's Oscillons.

164
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:25,750
And I'm going to use P5JS, which is a graphics
drawing library based on processing.

165
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:31,259
The processing language was designed to make
drawing with code accessible for nonprogrammers.

166
00:11:31,259 --> 00:11:35,770
It's super great if you're interested in trying
out graphical things, I highly recommend checking

167
00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:36,770
it out.

168
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:41,399
It's great reference and documentation, and
it's an online editor.

169
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:45,389
Really easy to use so a good place to start.

170
00:11:45,389 --> 00:11:47,380
Jump to demo.

171
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:55,230
In P5, off global draw function that will
get called to draw a frame of your animation

172
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:57,030
or visual.

173
00:11:57,030 --> 00:11:59,600
And so, in this I'm just doing something really
simple.

174
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:06,319
Just setting the center of the canvas as zerozero
and drawing a tiny circle here at zerozero

175
00:12:06,319 --> 00:12:10,360
with the width and height of 10 pixels.

176
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,960
And that's not superinteresting.

177
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:14,980
What's more interesting is that you can animate
things.

178
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:18,170
So, here I'm adding a little counter.

179
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:22,709
And incrementing it at every frame that's
being drawn.

180
00:12:22,709 --> 00:12:33,300
And using that value to position the coordinate
of the little circle.

181
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:42,590
I can draw a circle, and the formula is R
sine theta, what X equals, and R is R cost

182
00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:45,500
data, and R is the circle.

183
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,392
Drawing circles in circles.

184
00:12:47,392 --> 00:12:51,019
Circles are cool, but not superinteresting.

185
00:12:51,019 --> 00:12:56,660
What's more interesting is you can mess around
with theta and multiply it by two different

186
00:12:56,660 --> 00:13:00,860
fragments, and you get a pretzel.

187
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:04,040
This is an example of a figure.

188
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:08,459
It's when your sign and cause functions are
at different phases.

189
00:13:08,459 --> 00:13:11,459
It creates interesting loopy effects.

190
00:13:11,459 --> 00:13:12,660
All right.

191
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:19,389
So, what I can do now is I can have the pretzel
and then draw an additional point.

192
00:13:19,389 --> 00:13:21,040
Pretzel is one point.

193
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:24,040
And draw the ellipse over here.

194
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:29,320
And I can draw a line between those two points,
and you get kind of that, but not quite still

195
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,949
because this overlaps.

196
00:13:30,949 --> 00:13:33,639
And it keeps on getting brighter and brighter.

197
00:13:33,639 --> 00:13:39,230
So, what you can do is that whoops.

198
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:41,930
You can fade out the lines as they're being
drawn.

199
00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:46,389
And this, I imagine, would be what that might
look like on the oscilloscope screen.

200
00:13:46,389 --> 00:13:48,430
A close approximation of it.

201
00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:52,350
So, I have actually the code here in P5 demo.

202
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:56,050
I will send out a link to the slides on my
Twitter after this so you can play with it

203
00:13:56,050 --> 00:14:00,709
and you can sort of mess around with some
of the values and run it and see how that

204
00:14:00,709 --> 00:14:03,600
changes the movements or the effects.

205
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,120
It's kind of interesting because you never
know what you're gonna get.

206
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,480
You just punch in stuff, that looks good.

207
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,480
Or not.

208
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:12,069
And you just have to figure out what you're
looking for.

209
00:14:12,069 --> 00:14:14,520
You can also add color here.

210
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:19,730
Instead of straight lines, I drew curves,
same idea.

211
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:25,420
And, yeah, so, that's it for oscilloscope
art.

212
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:26,600
Next, vector graphics.

213
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:29,300
Vector graphics has a special place in my
heart.

214
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:31,250
I really enjoy working with it.

215
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:37,759
To understand why vector graphics are really
important and they're mostly lines and geometric

216
00:14:37,759 --> 00:14:45,350
shapes, we need to understand the output available
in the computers.

217
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:47,319
This was before laser printers.

218
00:14:47,319 --> 00:14:52,250
You couldn't print a highdefinition image
really easily like we do now.

219
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:56,810
In order to create really detailed images,
people would use mechanical plotters.

220
00:14:56,810 --> 00:15:00,040
Think of it as a drawing robot.

221
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:07,449
It has a pen and can move on the Y or X axis
across the surface of the paper and draw on

222
00:15:07,449 --> 00:15:08,449
it.

223
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:09,449
This is a drum printer.

224
00:15:09,449 --> 00:15:14,540
It moves the Y which is paper and the X which
is the pen.

225
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:19,800
And so, the limitation with plotters is that
all you have is literally a robot arm that

226
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,060
draws lines.

227
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:23,949
And so, you had to describe your graphics
in terms of vectors.

228
00:15:23,949 --> 00:15:26,820
So, you had to provide coordinates in which
to move around.

229
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:30,670
Can't do colors or gradients or fancy things.

230
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:36,730
So, a lot of the esthetic back then had to
do with lines, especially close together to

231
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:38,480
have the effects.

232
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:42,459
Here is one I saw a lot of.

233
00:15:42,459 --> 00:15:50,199
The basic idea is you take a geometric shape
and nest it and get the cool, swirly effect.

234
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:51,199
Okay.

235
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:52,199
Interesting.

236
00:15:52,199 --> 00:15:56,100
Like it's just nested squares, whatever.

237
00:15:56,100 --> 00:16:00,829
And in fact, it was so popular that it was
the esthetic for cybernetic serendipity which

238
00:16:00,829 --> 00:16:08,529
is the first ever computer exhibition that
focused on computer art and held in the institute

239
00:16:08,529 --> 00:16:10,980
of contemporary arts in London.

240
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:13,620
It was a really big deal at the time.

241
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:18,019
And the fact that they chose this for the
graphics, I guess it must be really popular.

242
00:16:18,019 --> 00:16:19,180
Inspires some imagination.

243
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:26,879
A little side note about Cybernetics Serendipity,
it was by a Polish woman, Jasia Reichardt,

244
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:33,601
and she brought together the artists and showcased
them.

245
00:16:33,601 --> 00:16:40,290
And it's the name is a reference to the happy
chance discoveries that you make with the

246
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:42,079
computer.

247
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:46,750
Sometimes it's random and you don't know what's
going come out and sometimes it's really beautiful.

248
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:51,839
I saw this motif used over and over again
in interesting ways.

249
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:53,470
I was like whatever, I don't know.

250
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:59,690
But later I found out this was actually a
visualization to a calculus problem.

251
00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:04,930
That makes sense, the early artists were people
with access to computers, scientists and mathematicians.

252
00:17:04,930 --> 00:17:12,720
The problem is like this, imagine four flies
sitting on a card table and they start walking

253
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:13,880
at the same rate.

254
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:17,530
Each going towards the fly on the right.

255
00:17:17,530 --> 00:17:21,840
The math in calculus is to find the path of
each.

256
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:26,080
If I'm trying to solve it, cool.

257
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:27,310
I don't think about it.

258
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:29,280
It's not very interesting.

259
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:36,160
But if you visualize it over here with each
color representing the path of a certain fly,

260
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,930
it actually looks you get that swirly effect.

261
00:17:38,930 --> 00:17:45,970
And it gets really pretty when you draw lines
between each of the different flies here.

262
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:47,870
And I also added pretty gradients.

263
00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:51,630
Here is some video just in case the demo didn't
work.

264
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:54,300
You know, got to be prepared.

265
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:59,130
And I found out that you could do this not
just with four, but with three flies or five

266
00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:00,130
or six.

267
00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:03,820
And because of I have a computer that runs
really fast and I can cue up for it, I can

268
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:06,070
run it as many times as I want.

269
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:10,410
And what I want to do with the shape is to
tell it.

270
00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:14,650
If you put them all together, these are triangles.

271
00:18:14,650 --> 00:18:19,040
What's fun to see is when you look at this,
the first that you see is not the triangle.

272
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:22,190
It's actually this spirallike shape.

273
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:24,820
And you don't want expect that to come out
of this.

274
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:27,470
So, kind of like that emerging property.

275
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:29,260
Here is one with squares.

276
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:35,090
It's a shape that's really, really hypnotizing.

277
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:39,900
So, All right.

278
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:42,570
And now I'm going to tell you about textbased
art.

279
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:45,620
Some of you are thinking ASCII, right?

280
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:49,950
I will talk about that.

281
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:54,280
First, I want to talk about what was it like
outputting text.

282
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:59,670
So, there were CRT monitors, but they had
an output.

283
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:02,840
Here is a line printer for the '60s, I believe.

284
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:09,620
And it's a line printer because it prints
by lines and does that really fast because

285
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:11,160
it has a fixed character set.

286
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:13,510
You can only print certain characters.

287
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:15,240
Just goes line by line.

288
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:18,180
Supergreat are for printing out text.

289
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:22,060
And so, people figured out ways to make creative
works with this.

290
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:27,630
Here, a couple of pieces of work by Frederick
Hammersley.

291
00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:32,270
And you can see the images here.

292
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:35,810
I really like these two.

293
00:19:35,810 --> 00:19:40,120
And the interesting thing about this, this
was actually created with something called

294
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:42,600
the art one programming language.

295
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:48,840
And it was created by Katherine Nash and Richard
H. Williams at a university in New Mexico.

296
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:52,160
Nash was from the art department and Williams
was from the engineering department and they

297
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:58,020
collaborated to make this language with the
intention to teach students to make simple

298
00:19:58,020 --> 00:19:59,390
computer graphics.

299
00:19:59,390 --> 00:20:04,320
It was notable for its simplicity and intended
as an introduction to the use of computers

300
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,680
for those without a technological background.

301
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:12,200
And that sounds familiar, that sounds like
P5 and processing.

302
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,200
That's really cool.

303
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:17,790
Art 1 was the original processing for P5.

304
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:19,810
This is from the '60s.

305
00:20:19,810 --> 00:20:26,450
And if you look at the documentation, it may
look more complicated for art 1, but the API

306
00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:29,400
is the same thing.

307
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:33,480
You pass in the center of the ellipse and
then the size of it.

308
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:38,180
And the same thing, and art 1, punch it on
the card and do all that.

309
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:42,150
But the P5 is like type it in, magic.

310
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:47,910
Another interesting thing I noticed is if
you look at the detail of some of these pieces,

311
00:20:47,910 --> 00:20:53,860
you notice that the way that it creates its
depth of texture is by overlooking characters.

312
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:56,710
You know they had the fixed set of characters.

313
00:20:56,710 --> 00:21:02,580
And in order to get creative with more textures
and effects, they would overlap two different

314
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:04,050
characters together.

315
00:21:04,050 --> 00:21:08,740
This piece is made up entirely of zeros, dots,
dashes and apostrophes.

316
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:11,290
And that was brilliant because you have a
printer.

317
00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:13,270
You can print over things.

318
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:15,950
Let's do it.

319
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:20,240
And I was really inspired by the fact this
was really art that was making the most out

320
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,800
of the available technology.

321
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:28,050
Being creative with what they had instead
of creating in spite of it.

322
00:21:28,050 --> 00:21:32,180
And we still have this today, kind of.

323
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:39,870
Only difference is that it's not really SBR,
it's more like EBCDIC, extended binary coded

324
00:21:39,870 --> 00:21:43,600
decimal interchange code, supported by IBM
at the time.

325
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:46,090
And it was even more limited than ASCII.

326
00:21:46,090 --> 00:21:49,710
As you can see on the top of the character
set.

327
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:51,780
It's a little hard to see.

328
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:54,230
But not a lot of characters.

329
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:58,880
I was curious, what was it like working in
this language?

330
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:01,210
Original art one.

331
00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:02,950
What features did they have?

332
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:05,090
What did they choose to include?

333
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:10,290
I did a little research and it's surprisingly
hard to find things written about Art one.

334
00:22:10,290 --> 00:22:17,210
The only thing where I found something significant
was in the Reichardt book.

335
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:20,790
There was a flowchart talking about the languages.

336
00:22:20,790 --> 00:22:30,010
And you can draw a line, solid rectangles,
open rectangles, triangles, ellipses, and

337
00:22:30,010 --> 00:22:34,880
I don't know why they had solid and open rectangles
but not solid and open ellipse.

338
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:37,340
Not sure.

339
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:41,020
This was simple and straightforward and yet
people can create interesting things out of

340
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:42,020
it.

341
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:45,840
I was inspired to recreate this using JavaScript.

342
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,050
I have here the code.

343
00:22:47,050 --> 00:22:48,600
It's on GitHub.

344
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:51,230
Still a work in progress.

345
00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:53,170
Please don't judge.

346
00:22:53,170 --> 00:22:55,220
So, I was like, here's the thing.

347
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:56,220
I don't have a printer, right?

348
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:58,150
I'm not going to go out and buy a printer.

349
00:22:58,150 --> 00:23:03,210
What's the closest thing we have to a printer
that's easily accessible?

350
00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:07,320
And I settled on the terminal.

351
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:10,820
Limited character set, wonderful, easy to
use.

352
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:15,570
Here is an example of a piece of work that
I created using the same rules that were available.

353
00:23:15,570 --> 00:23:16,640
Art one.

354
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:19,470
And here these are made with triangles.

355
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:25,420
But they have interesting like 3D effect.

356
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:28,950
You can do colors with terminals.

357
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:32,360
Here's one that's actually inspired by the
skirt that I'm wearing right now.

358
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:40,000
And so, you remember how I talked about how
creative they got with overlapping characters?

359
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:45,840
So, here's the thing, turns out in a terminal
it's really hard to overlap characters if

360
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:48,800
you're not using an extended library.

361
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,610
So, I was like, okay.

362
00:23:50,610 --> 00:23:52,430
What's the next best thing I got?

363
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:55,630
Which is accents or diacritical marks.

364
00:23:55,630 --> 00:24:00,340
You see for the Ss, there's an accent at the
top and the bottom.

365
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:05,630
Same here, this is an asterisk and then the
accent with the box around it.

366
00:24:05,630 --> 00:24:07,230
And a lot of my interesting happy accidents.

367
00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:12,910
Like the way that you color the background
of the characters, sometimes it's a little

368
00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:16,800
out of sync, but I like that effect.

369
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,470
So, yeah, use what you have.

370
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:20,280
I used Unicode.

371
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:27,040
Not quite SDR, but Unicode art and that was
fun to play with.

372
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:29,260
This just skims the surface.

373
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:34,970
There's way, way, way so much more history
in computer graphics and computer art.

374
00:24:34,970 --> 00:24:40,660
In Europe alone, I tailored this talk for
Europe because a lot of the history came out.

375
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:47,070
And Frieder Nake and Georg Nees, prolific
computer artist in the '70s.

376
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:53,220
And from Hungary, making computer drawings
before computer were a thing and also when

377
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:54,250
they were a thing.

378
00:24:54,250 --> 00:25:03,340
And not to forget the new tendencies movement
in what was once Yugoslavia and now Croatia.

379
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:05,270
And there's an 800page book on this.

380
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:10,539
If you want to look it up, the title is over
here.

381
00:25:10,539 --> 00:25:15,420
This is an interesting movement because they
celebrate the modular or procedural art.

382
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:18,280
Even before computers were used for it.

383
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:23,360
And as computers became more and more known,
they also became a part of this movement.

384
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:25,230
So, yeah.

385
00:25:25,230 --> 00:25:28,270
Before I end I just want to talk a little
bit about why?

386
00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:32,930
Why go through all this research like looking
at things from 60 years ago?

387
00:25:32,930 --> 00:25:40,460
So, a thing that I noticed, especially in
the web world, is that we are always looking

388
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:43,280
at, you know, what's new and what's shiny.

389
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:45,430
What can I do next?

390
00:25:45,430 --> 00:25:50,960
And we don't take a lot of time to step back
and to look at what has already been done.

391
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:55,470
But it's important to understand that we didn't
all get here just on our own.

392
00:25:55,470 --> 00:26:01,320
We really, you know, were built on the we
really stand on the shoulders of giants.

393
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:04,260
It's really important to know where you came
from.

394
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:08,730
Because if you don't know what has already
been done, you don't know how to make something

395
00:26:08,730 --> 00:26:09,740
new.

396
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:11,770
So, yeah.

397
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:14,760
This has given me a lot of appreciation for
the technology we have today.

398
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:20,100
And, of course, there is no shame in finding
inspiration from the past.

399
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:24,080
You can pick what has already been done and
make it your own, refine it.

400
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:29,490
Learn from all these people who have put in
all the work and creativity to get us where

401
00:26:29,490 --> 00:26:31,140
we are here today.

402
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:33,120
And that's all I have for you.

403
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,840
I have a blog.

404
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:37,230
I write about this stuff if you're interested.

405
00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:38,230
But, yeah.

406
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:42,770
It was such a pleasure.
