00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:05,920

[Music]

2
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:13,150
[Applause]

3
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:15,800
sorry oh hi

4
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:19,920
so yeah I'm Katrina I'm now a front-end

5
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,859
developer based in Berlin here and when

6
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:25,260
I first heard about the topic here which

7
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:27,720
is actually a very awesome idea to talk

8
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:30,060
about gratitude and how communities come

9
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:32,969
tied to that I was thinking to myself

10
00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:35,640
it's like is there one person or one

11
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:37,700
group I'm especially grateful for and

12
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:40,770
since my life was very meandering and it

13
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:44,129
kind of still is I couldn't pick one not

14
00:00:44,129 --> 00:00:45,629
in good conscience could I just pick one

15
00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:47,399
because it would do injustice to all the

16
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:49,770
other awesome people and communities

17
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:51,870
that have brought me to where I am today

18
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:55,649
and so my quick bio which is not so

19
00:00:55,649 --> 00:00:56,640
quick but it's tied to all these

20
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,180
communities goes a little bit like this

21
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:02,879
and I forgot my name tag here and so

22
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:04,769
yeah I was born raised went to school

23
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:06,540
finished school get my first computer

24
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:08,939
only at age 20 since my mom couldn't

25
00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:12,090
afford anyone before that studied German

26
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:14,340
literature linguistics and many many

27
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:17,310
other things and around 2004 --is--

28
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:20,220
started to dabble with HTML and CSS with

29
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:22,979
the help of the save HTML maybe some

30
00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:24,479
people still remember I see some smiles

31
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:28,380
yes which is still online till today so

32
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:31,439
you can check it out um but yeah I never

33
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:33,270
really followed through I finished my

34
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:36,540
university but until various jobs but

35
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:38,130
never really had an idea what I wanted

36
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:40,560
to do with my professional life yeah

37
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,020
maybe something was internet but who

38
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:47,340
knows until one day in 2012 Michele just

39
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:49,259
mentioned it the rails girls workshop in

40
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:51,420
Berlin happened and that was the one

41
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:55,170
life-changing moment for me that I can

42
00:01:55,170 --> 00:02:00,090
pin pin point it down that changed

43
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:02,579
everything afterwards but it also a

44
00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:04,140
didn't fell from the sky I didn't hear

45
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:06,930
about it just like so I heard about it

46
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:09,869
by the Berlin Twitter community that

47
00:02:09,869 --> 00:02:11,730
brought me in touch with the folks who

48
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:13,090
then also found at the

49
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:16,060
space and people who found it a CSS

50
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:22,780
conference J has conned yeah so the red

51
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:26,530
cuts workshop very incredible afterwards

52
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:28,209
we started off the Berlin the local

53
00:02:28,209 --> 00:02:31,569
Berlin chapter which is now called

54
00:02:31,569 --> 00:02:33,519
called curious Misha I mention it

55
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:36,580
because we're not girls after 20 we're

56
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:41,080
women or females not tight that were

57
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:43,120
harsh and also it's never been just

58
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,400
about rails its Ruby and the front end

59
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:49,480
stack as well then I went traveling came

60
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:52,930
back in between the Summer of Code a

61
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:55,120
stipend ship was founded and I wasn't

62
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,310
organized there and at some point fun

63
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:59,530
fact I realized I never learned Ruby

64
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:02,049
like I'm helping all these people in the

65
00:03:02,049 --> 00:03:03,610
Ruby and the red skirts movement but I

66
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:05,410
never learned Ruby and at some point

67
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:08,379
again one day I realized I'm helping all

68
00:03:08,379 --> 00:03:11,260
these women become developers what about

69
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:14,560
me and I stopped back to HTML and CSS

70
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,989
and my old love for CSS a walk again and

71
00:03:16,989 --> 00:03:19,389
I started to learn it properly learn

72
00:03:19,389 --> 00:03:22,900
front-end properly amongst others with

73
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:25,780
the help of CSS classes tied to the open

74
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:27,400
tech school that fluckey mentioned with

75
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:30,099
the conference nails a lot of other

76
00:03:30,099 --> 00:03:33,489
things at first I wasn't attendee then I

77
00:03:33,489 --> 00:03:35,560
became a coach I am NOT an organizer

78
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:38,560
again which I would like to use as a

79
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,349

to come back to the rails Kurds movement

89
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,510
and what is behind that Ruby community

90
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:09,940
that had the biggest impact on me of all

91
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:15,849
because it's not a lightest it's not

92
00:04:15,849 --> 00:04:18,099
exclusionary inclusionary from the

93
00:04:18,099 --> 00:04:22,229
beginning the whole atmosphere has been

94
00:04:22,229 --> 00:04:25,490
developers are keen to support

95
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:27,080
and they're happy to support there were

96
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:29,600
so many people stepping in starting

97
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,520
after that first red card workshop

98
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:36,289
within weeks there were four study

99
00:04:36,289 --> 00:04:38,360
groups happening weekly on a weekly

100
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:41,030
basis with two to four coaches for each

101
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:43,970
group and also the whole existence of

102
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:46,610
Ruby the Ruby programming language is

103
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:49,430
based on making the code and to develop

104
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:51,800
a experience and more human experience

105
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:56,509
making the code human readable and this

106
00:04:56,509 --> 00:04:59,270
bird went all the way down to the red

107
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:01,699
skirt community and it's something that

108
00:05:01,699 --> 00:05:04,970
I want to bring now into the with the

109
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:07,430
set of CSS classes and together with all

110
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:10,210
these awesome people here also into the

111
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:14,990
CSS and J's community and yeah at some

112
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:17,990
point I realized I am a career changer I

113
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:21,610
am what people usually call self-taught

114
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:24,650
but yes I do have my share in it but

115
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:27,289
it's not just me I'm actually community

116
00:05:27,289 --> 00:05:29,330
taught because community has made it

117
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:30,710
possible for me to be a front-end

118
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:33,409
developer now and last but not least I

119
00:05:33,409 --> 00:05:37,340
want to mention one key factor in the

120
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:39,470
Berlin community scene and that is the

121
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:42,919
co-op space and in a blur of the Berlin

122
00:05:42,919 --> 00:05:46,430
community providing space for hackathons

123
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:49,550
meetups workshops for free so we can

124
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:52,760
stay independent as well thank you very

125
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:55,159
much for that please support them

126
00:05:55,159 --> 00:05:59,150
however and whenever you can just

127
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:01,310
amazing and that's it thank you very

128
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:02,640
much for listening

129
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:06,210
[Applause]
