them really good to be back at JS calm

29
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:29,180
my first ever technical conference was

30
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:32,060
JS conf in 2010 when i had the fortune

31
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:34,729
of that volcano and it's been really

32
00:01:34,729 --> 00:01:36,200
awesome to just see this conference grow

33
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,509
now with 50 thirty-three percent more

34
00:01:38,509 --> 00:01:40,850

00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:42,500
really nice and also it's really cool

36
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:45,320
it's a you know here in Florida my mom

37
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:46,820
you know went to high school in college

38
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:50,590
here I drink a lot of their orange juice

39
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:52,969
we send them a lot of old people from

40
00:01:52,969 --> 00:01:55,549
New York really it's it's cool because I

41
00:01:55,549 --> 00:01:57,350
don't you guys know but if you have like

42
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:58,850
like a week you get like a bunch of

43
00:01:58,850 --> 00:01:59,899
nerds to be like hundreds of nerds

44
00:01:59,899 --> 00:02:02,840
together like a whole week you know from

45
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:03,920
all over the country you can just talk

46
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,009
about stuff and you guys definitely I me

47
00:02:07,009 --> 00:02:08,330
know if you know you've know this but

48
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:09,979
you can definitely keep the dream alive

49
00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:12,410
I know because I did the same thing 20

50
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:15,110
years ago at Space Camp right down the

51
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:19,400
street so uh yeah so my first talk was

52
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,950
fab it was it was really crazy it was

53
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:23,000
this framework that was like really

54
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,800
really functional and like all these

55
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,270
nested not nested but like all these

56
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:27,890
parentheses to like it was basically a

57
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:31,160
lisp e type thing it was very academic

58
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,240
didn't go very far

59
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:34,040
bought a domain and then I let it lapse

60
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,780
and it got I discovered two months ago

61
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:38,720
picked up by a domain squatter so you

62
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,330
can tell it was clearly making buck good

63
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:42,890
bucks off of this off the framework

64
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:44,900
because it's a finance thing and you

65
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:47,590
actually read the read the text there

66
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:49,970
almost all of them who pay taxes want to

67
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:51,440
save some money from them and hence they

68
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,030
go for various tax saving options which

69
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:54,200
are available and most of them are

70
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:58,610
investment options so if you think this

71
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:00,080
language is difficult to understand well

72
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,210
I would actually argue that it's not

73
00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:04,550
that much harder than fab itself which

74
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:07,190
is there before it so it was kind of an

75
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:09,770
esoteric approach to programming then of

76
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:11,720
esoteric as well I did the thing called

77
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:14,000
140 bites I was a go golfing contests or

78
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,160
plenty of contributors here I'm sure we

79
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,330
pretty much saturated the space of all

80
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:20,000
the things you can do in 1 40 bytes in

81
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,830
in JavaScript it was really cool i have

82
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:23,240
this thing called Domo it's basically

83
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:26,600
like let's put HTML and CSS in the

84
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,490
syntax of JavaScript so instead of

85
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:30,260
writing style sheets instead of writing

86
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:32,240
HTML you write it all in JavaScript it's

87
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:34,850
a small library presented that recently

88
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:37,430
I also wrote I'm sorry I didn't write I

89
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:40,880
had written about me this the JED

90
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:43,970
toolkit which was actually I woke up one

91
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:45,410
morning and found out that my entire

92
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:48,680
image had been co-opted by this this

93
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,690
toolkit for some reason but it actually

94
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:52,960
inspired me i turned it around I then

95
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:56,330
found my favorite programmer and decided

96
00:03:56,330 --> 00:03:59,180
to make a library named after him Angus

97
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:01,310
scroll so I'm sure you can guess the

98
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:05,140
library is a Angus Kroll

99
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:07,640
it's a scrolling directive for angularjs

100
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:08,690
so you should check that out when you

101
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:17,049
have a chance look there is thanks Angus

102
00:04:17,049 --> 00:04:18,949
mastery client service learning together

103
00:04:18,949 --> 00:04:20,989
of course everyone knows where this

104
00:04:20,989 --> 00:04:26,060
quote is adapted from Ghostbusters human

105
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:27,560
sacrifice cats and dogs living together

106
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,720
mass hysteria was the quote from

107
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:32,600
Ghostbusters which was filmed in 1984 or

108
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,919
at least probably releasing on TV for

109
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:34,940
him even before that actually it's

110
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:37,270
probably 30 years old now Wow I filled

111
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:43,010
cats and dogs 30 years later if you

112
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:45,139
google cats and dogs living together it

113
00:04:45,139 --> 00:04:48,650
turned out not so bad they didn't have

114
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:49,820
the internet I guess back in the 80s

115
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:51,979
Bill Murray is a great actor but I guess

116
00:04:51,979 --> 00:04:53,150
he didn't see this coming actually was

117
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:56,000
not so bad so uh mission accomplished

118
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,289
good job of course that phrase care of

119
00:05:00,289 --> 00:05:03,169
george w president george w bush care of

120
00:05:03,169 --> 00:05:06,010
florida thank you for that guess

121
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:09,770
speaking of mistakes from the 90s there

122
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:12,260
there was this book men are from Mars

123
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:13,729
Women are from Venus is the same thing

124
00:05:13,729 --> 00:05:15,349
where it's like this kind of like cats

125
00:05:15,349 --> 00:05:16,789
and dogs can't get along they can get

126
00:05:16,789 --> 00:05:18,260
along we saw pictures men are from Mars

127
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:21,139
or Venus you know and also and I think

128
00:05:21,139 --> 00:05:22,310
our community this is the client-server

129
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:23,510
model thing where it's like are you a

130
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:24,800
client guy are you server guy it's like

131
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,360
one or the other you kind of putting us

132
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,979
together so like you know just like man

133
00:05:27,979 --> 00:05:29,750
from Mars Women for Venus it's like no

134
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:34,370
duh people are from Earth hello open a

135
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:36,139
book I don't fit mountain Scientology

136
00:05:36,139 --> 00:05:38,710
maybe they have a different thing but I

137
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:40,820
kind of feel the same way about our

138
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:42,949
thing clients are from Mountain View and

139
00:05:42,949 --> 00:05:49,430
servers are from Oakland but just like

140
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:51,080
Earth is a common ground between Venus

141
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:55,169
and Mars we have the san mateo bridge

142
00:05:55,169 --> 00:05:58,469
it's beautiful really know seriously uh

143
00:05:58,469 --> 00:06:01,409
you know like Angus talked about William

144
00:06:01,409 --> 00:06:02,610
Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet I think

145
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:03,900
this is actually the original cover that

146
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:07,229
he had on his on his version you know

147
00:06:07,229 --> 00:06:08,370
it's the Montagues and Capulets and

148
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:09,689
fighting and then like lovers from each

149
00:06:09,689 --> 00:06:11,729
meet and it's this whole thing or

150
00:06:11,729 --> 00:06:13,319
likewise West Side Story it's an

151
00:06:13,319 --> 00:06:15,810
adaptation of this you know the Jets and

152
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:17,729
sharks and you know to meet and then you

153
00:06:17,729 --> 00:06:19,710
know for us I guess it's more of a

154
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:22,499
client side story but I'm just wondering

155
00:06:22,499 --> 00:06:24,419
you know are we gonna find our Romeo and

156
00:06:24,419 --> 00:06:26,219
Juliet are we going to find our Maria

157
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:27,689
and Tony to kind of bring these two

158
00:06:27,689 --> 00:06:30,300
together so the idea is let's kind of

159
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:31,830
kick this process off let's turn service

160
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:33,689
into clients and let's turn clients into

161
00:06:33,689 --> 00:06:36,150
servers okay so basically give two

162
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:37,919
approaches beach and so like you can

163
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:39,539
kind of you know widen your horizons if

164
00:06:39,539 --> 00:06:40,830
you're like a client guy it's really

165
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:43,050
easy to dabble actually not necessarily

166
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:44,310
know Jess but in other things to get

167
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:45,900
more of a server background likewise the

168
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:48,629
other way so first step let's turn

169
00:06:48,629 --> 00:06:50,909
servers into clients and I did this it's

170
00:06:50,909 --> 00:06:52,080
called browser bruh have you guys heard

171
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,330
of browser anyone alright cool let me

172
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:56,039
give you a little a little rundown I

173
00:06:56,039 --> 00:06:57,779
presented it at reject is in Berlin

174
00:06:57,779 --> 00:07:00,539
Germany last year I reject ass of course

175
00:07:00,539 --> 00:07:01,949
run by Robin sitting right in front me

176
00:07:01,949 --> 00:07:04,680
which is really cool it was in October

177
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,870
fourth or as noted heartthrob multiple

178
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:13,249
calls it April 10

179
00:07:13,259 --> 00:07:15,759
and yeah I actually what happened was I

180
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:18,009
tweeted I actually I tweeted this this

181
00:07:18,009 --> 00:07:21,129
the douchiest tweet ever wondering if

182
00:07:21,129 --> 00:07:22,810
this exists an oj server that exposes

183
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:24,099
WebSocket connected browsers over

184
00:07:24,099 --> 00:07:25,629
subdomains is disposable web home karate

185
00:07:25,629 --> 00:07:28,930
endpoints which is really you can tell i

186
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:31,300
hit all of the like the buzzword bingo

187
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:35,020
of yeah i missed a real time in trance

188
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:38,699
pile but yeah i'll pick those up someday

189
00:07:38,699 --> 00:07:42,460
yeah so the idea is it's an oj s server

190
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:44,259
in your browser ok i would you want to

191
00:07:44,259 --> 00:07:47,349
be this browser and it has a unibrow as

192
00:07:47,349 --> 00:07:52,330
a logo which is an actual a sri lankan

193
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:56,110
letter as it were i don't know if they

194
00:07:56,110 --> 00:07:58,360
have you knew browse over there but yeah

195
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:01,060
so basically it's HTTP / web sockets

196
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:03,400
okay so here's how it works there's five

197
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,020
easy steps all right follow me on this

198
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:08,440
one number one the browser connects to

199
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:10,240
the server right so just like you know

200
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,949
browser connect to the server just using

201
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:14,379
web socket right and then number two the

202
00:08:14,379 --> 00:08:16,000
server announces assigns and announces

203
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,409
the hostname so the browser comes in on

204
00:08:17,409 --> 00:08:18,789
a web socket and the server's like

205
00:08:18,789 --> 00:08:20,889
you're going to be like some ID dot

206
00:08:20,889 --> 00:08:23,560
whatever my domain is right and then he

207
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:25,210
can broadcast that to Evers listening on

208
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:27,699
the server and then the server proxies

209
00:08:27,699 --> 00:08:29,830
HTTP in so HTTP requests that are bound

210
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:32,500
for that host get proxied to the browser

211
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:35,440
and likewise any HTTP requests that are

212
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,479
made over this web socket to general

213
00:08:37,479 --> 00:08:38,919
internet or proxy through the server so

214
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:40,180
there's no cross domain anything it's

215
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:41,079
like you're just going through a server

216
00:08:41,079 --> 00:08:43,800
because it's a proxy anyway and then

217
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:46,000
yeah and then the browser becomes a

218
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,709
server so basically here's how here's

219
00:08:47,709 --> 00:08:49,420
what it looks like so there's two sides

220
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:50,290
right there's a client-side and

221
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:53,649
server-side so on the server side first

222
00:08:53,649 --> 00:08:55,540
you have your your web socket engine or

223
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:56,769
whatever shame you want to use you can

224
00:08:56,769 --> 00:08:59,130
use a sock JS engine i/o socket i/o

225
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:01,120
straight up web sockets whatever you

226
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,220
want that's optional then browse over

227
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:06,160
which is like 1.3 k of codes not a lot

228
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,390
this is like an API think it's not a

229
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:08,860
technology is just like an API to wrap

230
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:10,570
an existing technology and your coat

231
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:13,779
looks like this you create a WebSocket

232
00:09:13,779 --> 00:09:17,079
server you create an HTTP server and on

233
00:09:17,079 --> 00:09:18,730
request you do some stuff just like it

234
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:21,250
would note and then that HP server

235
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:22,720
listens on the WebSocket server that

236
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,250
make sense this is all making sense so

237
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:24,640
far

238
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:28,060
okay cool meanwhile on the server HTTP

239
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:30,640
engine io for example or you could do

240
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,960
straight-up WebSockets browser ver

241
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:34,270
create a server for each so the HP

242
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:35,980
server the web's the WebSocket server

243
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:38,980
and then the browser ver and then yeah

244
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:40,420
the browser listens to the WebSocket

245
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:42,100
server it also listens to the HTTP

246
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:44,200
server and then on connection it

247
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,150
announces that a server has come and you

248
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:47,260
can bind to that whatever you want and

249
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:49,030
then you just listen on a port so

250
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:51,100
basically it's a proxy that just maps

251
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:53,140
HTTP web sockets so it's really cool

252
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:54,940
because it's only like total like 3k of

253
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:57,010
code and it's just like a it's it's a

254
00:09:57,010 --> 00:09:58,660
it's a good way to look at adopt that

255
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:01,720
kind of paradigm so web sockets you know

256
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:02,920
it could have been server sent events

257
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:05,290
when I was doing this I mean there it's

258
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:06,760
because it's a rapper you really could

259
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:09,310
use any of these things web RTC or

260
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:14,200
polling or or polling we know is long

261
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:17,350
polling really you can use anything but

262
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:20,830
why why would you use HTTP right the

263
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:21,850
idea is like well why do we use

264
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:24,190
javascript is it because we can use the

265
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:27,220
same language everywhere maybe it's not

266
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:28,630
that you can maybe share the code but at

267
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:30,130
least you already know it you're already

268
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:31,930
in one domain you're already probably

269
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:34,870
familiar with HTTP so why not reuse that

270
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:36,220
for using things instead of learning a

271
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:38,440
new paradigm is one idea second idea is

272
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:41,050
like wine ojs like why is no gel so

273
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:46,670
popular well call back

274
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:51,370
which are the best / worst / best again

275
00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:55,090
thing about nodejs whether you like them

276
00:10:55,090 --> 00:10:57,220
or not callbacks are here you can wrap

277
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:59,200
them or you can't what I don't

278
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,730
understand that hasn't taken off web

279
00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:01,900
hooks haven't taken off nearly as much

280
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:03,550
as callbacks even though web hooks to me

281
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:07,870
are the HTTP version of callbacks and so

282
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:09,490
the idea is if you use something like

283
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:11,500
browser ver you can use web hooks I can

284
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,300
set up a web hook give an arbitrary host

285
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:14,710
to someone and they can just do whatever

286
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:16,150
they want to that URL and they get

287
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:18,070
routed to the browser so the idea is to

288
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:21,130
push the logic out to the end nodes so

289
00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:22,960
you can you know abstract your

290
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,010
transports because now you're just using

291
00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:25,240
HTTP you don't have to know anything

292
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:27,010
else you can decouple stuff because now

293
00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:28,930
now that you have an actual transport

294
00:11:28,930 --> 00:11:29,920
you can put things on different machines

295
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,020
and use it tech you already know that's

296
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:34,840
a that's the basic idea and you know I

297
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,280
got some feedback on similar library

298
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:38,560
that actually was relevant to this when

299
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,180
I was releasing don't is the thing I was

300
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:42,190
telling about with CSS but this is

301
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:43,750
actually a tweet that I really took to

302
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:45,700
heart and he sufficiently advanced

303
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:46,420
JavaScript framework is

304
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:49,090
indistinguishable from parody so I'm

305
00:11:49,090 --> 00:11:51,010
towing a really fine line here I'm not

306
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:52,990
sure if it's right or if it's going to

307
00:11:52,990 --> 00:12:00,710
work I have made mistakes in the past I

308
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:05,590
was in a I wasn't a boy band that's

309
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:07,360
actually not Joey Fatone that's Jonathan

310
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,080
David Dalton ooh kicking this thing

311
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,920
before he cleaned up and moved to

312
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:15,280
Microsoft yeah so we had this boy band

313
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:18,990
and it was like pretty sweet we charted

314
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:23,800
with our first hit but it started to

315
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,450
unravel he notes like the classic vh1

316
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:27,280
behind the music arc you know started

317
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:31,210
going downhill and then and then you

318
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:32,950
know just it really it really all fell

319
00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:33,850
apart when we started getting a little

320
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:37,810
too abstract in our message actually I

321
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:39,040
don't think we even I don't think we've

322
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:42,500
enjoyed about

323
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:45,550
so anyway how much time do I have that

324
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:46,780
still says 30 i'll have to have an

325
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:50,890
infinite time oh sweet alright halfway

326
00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:53,050
point sweet alright so we turn servers

327
00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:55,180
into clients right and see what you know

328
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:56,530
we can get from that let's turn clients

329
00:12:56,530 --> 00:13:01,480
into servers and so yeah yo dawg I know

330
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:05,960
I know I get that all time this is a

331
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:08,470
kind of the opposite of yo dawg if there

332
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:12,400
is such an opposite so so client-side

333
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,630
you know server-side client we're going

334
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:15,070
to do this there are a bunch of tools

335
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:17,530
you can use to do client stuff on the

336
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:19,360
server i'm going to show you three of

337
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:22,660
them that i use cheery ojs Tom and fan

338
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:25,480
MJS let's just go through these pretty

339
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:28,170
quickly you guys knew who this guy is

340
00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:31,600
that's a bogota a bogota god bless him

341
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,930
dead in 82 actually that's not true sure

342
00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:36,700
you know the story People magazine said

343
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:38,290
he was dead he wasn't dead he was

344
00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:41,110
performing a stage play fine they got it

345
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:43,600
right though in 1987 well not really

346
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,370
because it was another dude who's like

347
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:46,900
he's dead he's not so it's like this

348
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:50,290
running joke you know like when the hell

349
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:53,050
did he die kind of thing but they had a

350
00:13:53,050 --> 00:13:54,550
website and he doesn't want to actually

351
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:56,970
tell you whether he's dead or not and

352
00:13:56,970 --> 00:14:01,300
it's a bogota com it's pretty sweet

353
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:04,810
there it is ah the source this is just

354
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:07,840
what you think it is from that era yeah

355
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,160
it's pretty incredible if you want to

356
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:11,650
find out if a pagoda is live you have to

357
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:13,960
swim through this so you can see a

358
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:16,600
bogota is span class equals fixed alive

359
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:19,120
oh sorry line returned alive so it's

360
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,110
kind of an old school so it's like

361
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:21,670
obviously not intended for human for

362
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:23,680
machine conceptions for humans right but

363
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,110
like if we want to make an API I won't

364
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:28,030
know he's live I either i don't want

365
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:32,590
HTML i want yes or no or oh dear please

366
00:14:32,590 --> 00:14:36,850
no not like this I want yep nope for a

367
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:40,500
bogota

368
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:43,430
and so we scrape and so you know what do

369
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:45,889
you used to scrape well at the very soul

370
00:14:45,889 --> 00:14:48,110
I go up in complexity now so we can use

371
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:49,579
Michaels request thing we can install

372
00:14:49,579 --> 00:14:53,060
that we can you know have a really cool

373
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:56,420
color back name and when we find out

374
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:59,360
from this website we can look at status

375
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,070
codes and we can be like well this task

376
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:02,300
force to hundreds and now we don't know

377
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:03,529
because we can throw an error but then

378
00:15:03,529 --> 00:15:06,290
what do we do so we have all this HTML

379
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:07,579
how do we turn that into a boolean I

380
00:15:07,579 --> 00:15:10,010
mean right it's like it's I'll just use

381
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:12,980
regular expression right I don't have to

382
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:14,660
tell you where this goes I'm sure you've

383
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:19,690
seen this it goes it goes downhill

384
00:15:19,690 --> 00:15:26,250
really fast

385
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:28,730
I'm surprised keynote actually rendered

386
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:30,710
that that's pretty good pretty amazing

387
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:32,930
uh right have you tried using an HTML

388
00:15:32,930 --> 00:15:34,250
parser which is how that ends actually

389
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:36,500
pretty genius so let's try an HTML

390
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,210
parser i'm going to use cheerio if you

391
00:15:38,210 --> 00:15:39,980
guys heard a cheerio it's pretty neat

392
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:42,050
it's jquery core for servers so the idea

393
00:15:42,050 --> 00:15:43,310
is that there's no Dom it's like a

394
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:44,570
JavaScript implementation of the Dom

395
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:45,710
it's like very very simple and so it

396
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:47,720
just lets you do the basic simple stuff

397
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:48,890
that you'd expect to be able to do in

398
00:15:48,890 --> 00:15:50,210
jQuery in terms of manipulation and

399
00:15:50,210 --> 00:15:52,480
access things like that so get cheerio

400
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:56,000
put that in load some arbitrary the API

401
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:56,990
looks like this you just load some

402
00:15:56,990 --> 00:15:58,310
arbitrary HTML and then you can just run

403
00:15:58,310 --> 00:16:00,230
you know jquery like operations on it's

404
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:03,500
really cool so you install it and then

405
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,000
let's ok so let's take this thing its

406
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,950
load this body that we got from this

407
00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:08,630
website called it almost jquery and then

408
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:11,000
let's find class fix let's find the

409
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,680
first one take the text and its trim it

410
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,900
right and then if the status that thing

411
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:16,550
that we trimmed is alive then return

412
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:19,790
true otherwise walls that's cool so how

413
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:22,790
do we use this thing check on Abe if

414
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:24,890
he's okay throw an error if it's not a

415
00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:27,140
bits if if it is a boolean return

416
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:28,820
because this is just a test and

417
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:31,490
otherwise throw and this is how I throw

418
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:33,500
as a code golfer because I don't have

419
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:38,810
time for your new error this will return

420
00:16:38,810 --> 00:16:39,980
a reference error unless you have an

421
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:41,690
OMFG variable somewhere up in the code

422
00:16:41,690 --> 00:16:44,270
which maybe you do i don't know a little

423
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:45,950
throw and i come on it's got to throw at

424
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:51,140
some point this is on github check it

425
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:54,110
out I have received one pull request

426
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:55,850
which I accepted 15 hours after the

427
00:16:55,850 --> 00:16:58,850
presentation gave us less debt from

428
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:01,250
cowboy thank you that Ben Ellman so it's

429
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:03,440
works and you can just MPM install a

430
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,600
bogota you can also NPM isn't all I

431
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:08,030
Bogota thank you to Alex textin for that

432
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:11,750
one he pushed that through Isaac was a

433
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:14,500
he has a soft heart so you can do that

434
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:17,360
it's so cheery it was easy it's fast in

435
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:19,220
process the biggest problem with doing

436
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:22,100
something like this is JavaScript itself

437
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:24,170
because what if this web page is running

438
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:25,130
JavaScript we're not executing

439
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:27,260
JavaScript how would we know so

440
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:29,030
JavaScript is like our best friend and

441
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:31,850
our kind of best enemy in this case you

442
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:33,590
know your fancy single page apps what do

443
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:35,780
you do well next level up Janice dumb ok

444
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:38,300
coolz j zoms really cool

445
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:40,970
Nicola who's here is the maintainer of

446
00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:41,990
this there's like tons of committee

447
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:43,580
involvement as you can see there is lots

448
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:45,370
of modules that it uses so it's very

449
00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:48,200
kind of reuse kind of node style thing

450
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,210
and the API is pretty cool you require

451
00:17:50,210 --> 00:17:51,680
it you set up an environment you've

452
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:54,050
inject a script you get a call back and

453
00:17:54,050 --> 00:17:55,850
then you can see how many nodejs

454
00:17:55,850 --> 00:17:57,470
releases there are something right so

455
00:17:57,470 --> 00:17:59,720
that's it's a really easy API runs

456
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:02,180
JavaScript easy it's in process the

457
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:03,980
problem is actually your stuff built on

458
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:05,030
top of it there's no taiyou which is a

459
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:07,040
scraping engine there's a tobie which is

460
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:09,950
a testing framework zombie jess is

461
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:11,420
another thing that people use the

462
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:14,240
problem is it requires C++ because it

463
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,290
actually has to create like a new

464
00:18:15,290 --> 00:18:16,970
context to like evaluate that javascript

465
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:18,080
in because it's coming from an arbitrary

466
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,310
web page you know that running in your

467
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:21,230
like or your node process it's also

468
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:22,550
technically not a browser so you might

469
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:24,110
actually hit things where like stuff

470
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:25,160
doesn't exist because it's a pure

471
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,360
JavaScript implementation of a browser

472
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:27,980
so you can use selenium it's kind of

473
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:30,170
heavy or you know if you just need

474
00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:33,230
WebKit if WebKit is all you need or I'm

475
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:38,010
sorry as sorry as Alex Russell calls it

476
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:46,840
blink classic

477
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:48,630
yeah if you just need that you can use

478
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:50,730
phantom jayus ah cementum jess is really

479
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:52,530
it's really cool fam Reyes is like a

480
00:18:52,530 --> 00:18:55,680
totally powerful tool in fact if you are

481
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,450
a client more of a client personally

482
00:18:57,450 --> 00:18:58,560
more comfortable client and you're

483
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:00,180
looking and go server I would almost

484
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:01,800
recommend Phantom jayus before I would

485
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,270
recommend node because it's literally

486
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:05,340
it's a server it has the same API know

487
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:07,680
does you like type phantom Jas and then

488
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,450
type that you know the directory of the

489
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:11,070
script you just point to a script and

490
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:12,720
it'll execute that code but that code is

491
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,010
a browser environment with a duck with a

492
00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:15,600
window and a document and all that stuff

493
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,190
and so it's actually I think it's

494
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:18,750
actually a pretty good gateway drug to

495
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:21,420
doing more server stuff so I've been

496
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:22,920
using it for a bit it's actually really

497
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:26,970
cool yeah so there's stuff built on top

498
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:28,020
of it because you know it's it's a

499
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:28,950
little bit unwieldy there's a lot of

500
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:30,240
people who like want to use node and

501
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,160
want to use phantom j/s and so or like

502
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,570
phantom jess's may be too abstract and

503
00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:34,530
they want to build stuff on top of it

504
00:19:34,530 --> 00:19:35,820
Casper jayus is really popular thing

505
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:37,620
there's spooky j/s where you can

506
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:39,420
actually draw it the all this ghost

507
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:42,150
namings really kind of gets a I could

508
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:43,980
lose track of what's what spooky JSI

509
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:46,740
believe drives Casper from node so

510
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:48,600
Casper's like this you know really clean

511
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,160
API for testing and stuff automation on

512
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,990
top of phantom ge'ez and Casper can

513
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:54,870
drive that from node so there's all the

514
00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:56,220
stuff they're spending just note if you

515
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:58,620
don't need the abstraction of Casper you

516
00:19:58,620 --> 00:19:59,940
can just drive it yourself with phantom

517
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:02,370
Jo snowed there's school bus which is a

518
00:20:02,370 --> 00:20:03,510
thing that's actually not really

519
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:05,310
specific to phantom jayus it's like just

520
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:06,630
a way of driving around an iframe it's a

521
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:08,940
very sub stachy api if you understand

522
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:12,180
what that is so api this pretty cool you

523
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:14,490
know their system file system file

524
00:20:14,490 --> 00:20:17,070
system web server web page you can just

525
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:18,570
require it's like just commonjs pretty

526
00:20:18,570 --> 00:20:23,090
cool system you know web server web page

527
00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:25,950
so yeah you have access to like all of

528
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:28,110
these all these api is that you wouldn't

529
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:29,460
have access to in a normal browser like

530
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:30,480
for example if you want to get the

531
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,220
actual innerhtml the web page including

532
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:33,870
the doctype it's actually really hard to

533
00:20:33,870 --> 00:20:34,950
do in a browser because that's actually

534
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:36,810
not available to you in a serialized

535
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:38,880
format so you can use phantom she has to

536
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,710
do that for you and there's there's a

537
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:41,700
few things missing you know function

538
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:43,620
prototype bind isn't there and there's a

539
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:45,690
few kind of gotchas but it's the closest

540
00:20:45,690 --> 00:20:47,070
thing that we have to like a browser

541
00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:49,140
that's not really a browser then is very

542
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:51,450
very easily automatable all these

543
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:54,300
methods too so I built this thing called

544
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:56,519
render what is like

545
00:20:56,519 --> 00:20:58,080
my most recent fan of jas product

546
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:01,019
project do you have anyone has anyone

547
00:21:01,019 --> 00:21:02,519
seen this there was this there was a

548
00:21:02,519 --> 00:21:04,440
similar library actually built that does

549
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:06,119
a similar thing built by Airbnb it's

550
00:21:06,119 --> 00:21:11,729
called render so actually I change the

551
00:21:11,729 --> 00:21:15,179
name to render me yeah so it's a R&D art

552
00:21:15,179 --> 00:21:17,909
ME ME domain is I don't even know where

553
00:21:17,909 --> 00:21:20,669
but yeah so it's what's really cool so

554
00:21:20,669 --> 00:21:22,049
here's what here's this for do you guys

555
00:21:22,049 --> 00:21:25,799
know how hash bang SEO works do you guys

556
00:21:25,799 --> 00:21:26,849
know like if you've a single page app

557
00:21:26,849 --> 00:21:28,019
and you want SEO do you know like how to

558
00:21:28,019 --> 00:21:30,479
do that there's a few things you can do

559
00:21:30,479 --> 00:21:32,429
you're right you can inject you can

560
00:21:32,429 --> 00:21:34,979
actually like compile your HTML and put

561
00:21:34,979 --> 00:21:36,570
it in a no script tag you know people do

562
00:21:36,570 --> 00:21:39,749
that but actually when Twitter came out

563
00:21:39,749 --> 00:21:42,389
with the whole hash bank thing which is

564
00:21:42,389 --> 00:21:44,309
by the way the most famous piece of URL

565
00:21:44,309 --> 00:21:49,359
garbage since Alex sextons double men

566
00:21:49,369 --> 00:21:51,509
when you have a hash spangle will

567
00:21:51,509 --> 00:21:53,820
actually see a hash bang it will

568
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:56,700
actually go to that same URL without the

569
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:58,079
fragment because remember servers can't

570
00:21:58,079 --> 00:22:00,059
see fragments because the browser keeps

571
00:22:00,059 --> 00:22:01,200
that and just sends the rest of the

572
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,849
server so it replaces it with a query

573
00:22:02,849 --> 00:22:04,529
string underscore escape underscore

574
00:22:04,529 --> 00:22:06,509
fragment equals and the escaped version

575
00:22:06,509 --> 00:22:08,820
of what that hash bang was does that

576
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:10,739
make sense so that's really cool so now

577
00:22:10,739 --> 00:22:12,329
you don't actually have to like do any

578
00:22:12,329 --> 00:22:14,759
of this like crazy HTML mangling you can

579
00:22:14,759 --> 00:22:18,239
actually just tell google like what your

580
00:22:18,239 --> 00:22:19,649
rendered HTML would be for any given

581
00:22:19,649 --> 00:22:24,749
page so so there's the Google API so

582
00:22:24,749 --> 00:22:25,979
yeah it's kind of cool and so what

583
00:22:25,979 --> 00:22:29,940
render does is basically it lets you do

584
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:31,649
SEO more easily because like the problem

585
00:22:31,649 --> 00:22:33,149
with single page apps it's like well you

586
00:22:33,149 --> 00:22:35,700
want to see oh but you want speed right

587
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:37,079
because like so you want to see you

588
00:22:37,079 --> 00:22:38,639
because like you want so you do

589
00:22:38,639 --> 00:22:39,809
something server side because SEO is

590
00:22:39,809 --> 00:22:40,829
easier for the server because it's like

591
00:22:40,829 --> 00:22:42,539
well understood but then II want speed

592
00:22:42,539 --> 00:22:44,309
and we all know that you know for any

593
00:22:44,309 --> 00:22:45,450
app that you're gonna spend a lot of

594
00:22:45,450 --> 00:22:46,889
time and not just hit you know once in a

595
00:22:46,889 --> 00:22:48,959
while client-side opting to be faster

596
00:22:48,959 --> 00:22:50,219
but you want the SEO but you want the

597
00:22:50,219 --> 00:22:51,839
speed and I think with stuff like this

598
00:22:51,839 --> 00:22:53,519
you actually don't need to decide you

599
00:22:53,519 --> 00:22:55,049
can actually have your SEO and your

600
00:22:55,049 --> 00:22:58,799
speed you can have an SEO speedwagon

601
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:02,440
and and that's what render is so

602
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:04,720
basically the idea is this all render is

603
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:07,210
and I should how much time oh whoa you

604
00:23:07,210 --> 00:23:09,940
fix a thank you let's actually go check

605
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:13,179
it out I didn't intend to fire up

606
00:23:13,179 --> 00:23:21,010
anything but you rendered me so yeah um

607
00:23:21,010 --> 00:23:23,740
well that's thanks kiddo can you see

608
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:27,970
that let's actually look at what some

609
00:23:27,970 --> 00:23:30,580
code looks like so yeah just create like

610
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:32,830
a really tiny document spin up a server

611
00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:36,190
to serve it spin up a phantom j/s render

612
00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:37,750
me server which is you know just a tiny

613
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:40,690
tiny little bit I may be 3k of code and

614
00:23:40,690 --> 00:23:44,470
all that does is literally eat URLs and

615
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:47,440
poop HTML that's all it does right so

616
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,299
you're like hey render this page give me

617
00:23:49,299 --> 00:23:50,980
the HTML to all does right so it's not

618
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:52,240
built into your framework it's really

619
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,799
cool because then you can just when

620
00:23:53,799 --> 00:23:55,410
Google comes knocking when you're like

621
00:23:55,410 --> 00:23:57,610
Google's like knock knock knock get

622
00:23:57,610 --> 00:23:59,620
slashed and you're like redirect to hash

623
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:01,360
bang and google says did you just tell

624
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:05,440
me to go myself you can actually give

625
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:08,770
Google a 302 or 30 12 a service like

626
00:24:08,770 --> 00:24:10,120
this and be like I don't have the

627
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:11,320
rendered HTML but you can get it there

628
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:13,179
so now it's really cool is you don't

629
00:24:13,179 --> 00:24:14,860
have to bake all of this stuff into like

630
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:16,570
your existing app you can just put one

631
00:24:16,570 --> 00:24:18,130
line that looks for that escape URL

632
00:24:18,130 --> 00:24:19,780
fragment URL and just redirects to a

633
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:21,340
server like render that'll render it for

634
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:24,130
you and so it's pretty easy to use a

635
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:26,290
quick start on Heroku this is all the

636
00:24:26,290 --> 00:24:28,120
code you need to just get a render

637
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:29,860
instance up and running and actually

638
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:31,179
what's really cool is like there is no

639
00:24:31,179 --> 00:24:32,919
its server side JavaScript there's no

640
00:24:32,919 --> 00:24:34,809
node we're actually using just a

641
00:24:34,809 --> 00:24:37,390
straight-up Heroku build pack in this

642
00:24:37,390 --> 00:24:41,710
case for for phantom jeaious which is

643
00:24:41,710 --> 00:24:43,929
really cool and yeah so the API spurt

644
00:24:43,929 --> 00:24:45,880
easy just like give it a URL and hof

645
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:47,830
tell them like how long you're willing

646
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:49,330
to wait how many bytes you're willing to

647
00:24:49,330 --> 00:24:50,740
load whether you should load images and

648
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:51,850
what the ready event is to actually

649
00:24:51,850 --> 00:24:54,040
execute rendering and it will return the

650
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:58,660
HTML for you you're all so anyway if you

651
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:00,970
want check that out please do let me

652
00:25:00,970 --> 00:25:03,280
actually go back to my slides I don't

653
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:05,549
think I have much left here

654
00:25:05,549 --> 00:25:08,820
and I think that is it so what's cool

655
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:10,409
about this and I'm sorry about these

656
00:25:10,409 --> 00:25:12,179
like recursion memes I feel like every

657
00:25:12,179 --> 00:25:13,289
one of my presentations as a recursion

658
00:25:13,289 --> 00:25:15,899
me a minute what's cool about doing

659
00:25:15,899 --> 00:25:16,980
scripting like this is actually it's

660
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:19,470
kind of it's kind of a brain bender you

661
00:25:19,470 --> 00:25:21,989
are so someone has to Google like for

662
00:25:21,989 --> 00:25:23,730
example to bought as a client that

663
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:27,690
accesses your server your server then

664
00:25:27,690 --> 00:25:31,559
fires up a client right so that client

665
00:25:31,559 --> 00:25:33,059
then goes and get a web gets a web page

666
00:25:33,059 --> 00:25:34,350
about how do you get that web page back

667
00:25:34,350 --> 00:25:36,360
well the client actually followed fires

668
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:39,119
up its own server within phantom

669
00:25:39,119 --> 00:25:40,169
jessica's don't forget there's a web

670
00:25:40,169 --> 00:25:42,389
server in Phantom Jas and then it uses

671
00:25:42,389 --> 00:25:44,730
that to respond to requests to get web

672
00:25:44,730 --> 00:25:48,269
pages out and then I'm pretty sure just

673
00:25:48,269 --> 00:25:52,019
all goes to hell but but actually so

674
00:25:52,019 --> 00:25:53,460
like doing this kind of like putting a

675
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:54,570
server Brenda browser and putting a

676
00:25:54,570 --> 00:25:56,309
browser and server sometimes it's useful

677
00:25:56,309 --> 00:25:57,799
but it's actually like pretty rewarding

678
00:25:57,799 --> 00:26:00,480
programming in terms of like just

679
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:03,509
getting a like in one project like both

680
00:26:03,509 --> 00:26:05,369
of the server side and the client side

681
00:26:05,369 --> 00:26:06,809
in the same kind of code base which is

682
00:26:06,809 --> 00:26:10,049
pretty neat anyway so that's it if check

683
00:26:10,049 --> 00:26:11,609
out render me if you if you can and

684
00:26:11,609 --> 00:26:28,169
thank you for having me
