00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:08,100

I love this quote you know buy the

2
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:09,900
ticket take the ride almost everyone

3
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:12,809
here bought a ticket I actually didn't

4
00:00:12,809 --> 00:00:15,000
we'll get to that a minute I'm actually

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,710
here to talk to you about how Jays comp

6
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:18,480
and the people around it literally

7
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,580
changed my life and not just once but

8
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:23,699
over and over again and we'll get into

9
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:29,190
that but first hi I'm charlie you might

10
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:31,230
know me from some places as the internet

11
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:36,239
or the github or the Twitter's I created

12
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:38,880
and now help run Empire j/s an empire

13
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:41,160
node with a bunch of really rad people

14
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:44,489
many of whom are here today one of them

15
00:00:44,489 --> 00:00:45,780
would have introduced me if I didn't

16
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:48,450
have a lovely introduction from yawn and

17
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:50,280
I'm not just talking about co-organizers

18
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:53,070
but people who have spoken or attended

19
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:56,610
or helped out obviously none of what

20
00:00:56,610 --> 00:00:57,840
we've done in New York will be possible

21
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,910
without the help of chris and laura and

22
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:02,190
the community they helped create and

23
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:07,649
nurture first a special thanks to matt

24
00:01:07,649 --> 00:01:09,569
who took a lot of the photos you're

25
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:15,740
about to see

26
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:21,160
like this one of the Williams claim but

27
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:23,590
now that you know who I am and why I'm

28
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:30,100
here I want to talk about pirates this

29
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:33,040
is a photo of chris williams at jazz com

30
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,250
2010 which was for reasons i still have

31
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:41,350
never asked about pirate themed and it's

32
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:43,360
kind of a funny story how I ended up

33
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,210
back at jazz con for 2010 even back then

34
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:49,060
it sold out albeit a bit slower than it

35
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:52,450
does today and I know this because my

36
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:54,130
roommate at the time was trying to win a

37
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:57,370
ticket to go to jazz comp by competing

38
00:01:57,370 --> 00:02:00,490
in scurvy comp which was sort of like

39
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:03,880
reject Jas in America before reject j/s

40
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:06,010
existed in Europe because remember back

41
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:09,640
then this is 2010 way back it was

42
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:11,410
organized by Kyle Simpson and I think it

43
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:16,330
only happened that one time so fun fact

44
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:20,800
speaking of history if you getting

45
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,480
better at the slides I promise if you go

46
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,250
back and look at the lineup for Jays com

47
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:26,650
2010 you'll notice that although there

48
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:28,420
are a ton of speakers that are still

49
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:31,300
around today that gave many amazing

50
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:33,489
talks there's actually only one piece of

51
00:02:33,489 --> 00:02:36,310
technology that was talked about erin's

52
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:39,880
giving me the look and as that's that's

53
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:43,390
used and that's not-- and that's only

54
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:44,739
five years later i mean think about

55
00:02:44,739 --> 00:02:47,260
things that didn't exist you know five

56
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:49,300
years ago or will exist five years in

57
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:51,790
the future and this is both a leading

58
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:53,590
indicator of the importance of node and

59
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:55,540
the importance of the fact that in

60
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:59,760
reality people are greater than software

61
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:04,510
so back to our story that's me this is a

62
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:07,180
photo of me from scurvy comp I'm there

63
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:09,100
in the background I honestly couldn't

64
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:10,660
find a photo of myself in the foreground

65
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:13,480
because back then javascript wasn't that

66
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:15,489
important to me at all I didn't even do

67
00:03:15,489 --> 00:03:17,230
it professionally I was more concerned

68
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:20,960
with you guessed it dotnet

69
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,360
I was no more interested in things like

70
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:27,980
types and Silverlight and zamel silly

71
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:31,010
XML go home you're drunk um and if you

72
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:34,430
better go backwards and if you ever done

73
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:36,140
that you might know the community can

74
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:38,810
sometimes feel like this and that's not

75
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:41,120
to make a point of being disparaging or

76
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,920
negative but to really describe how I

77
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:46,010
felt back then I was really really

78
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:48,620
trying to connect with people i went to

79
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:50,630
dotnet conferences i wrote open source

80
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:52,730
because although i wasn't interested in

81
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:54,020
javascript yet I was still very

82
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:56,930
interested in open source but there was

83
00:03:56,930 --> 00:03:59,180
still nothing and I promise that this is

84
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:00,590
true you can go back and scroll to the

85
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:03,380
very very very very bottom of my github

86
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:05,240
profile and there's dotnet it's right

87
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:08,330
there so I tried but there was still

88
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:12,110
just you know more tumbleweeds that was

89
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:13,880
more than five years ago so today things

90
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,500
might be different if you do data net

91
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:16,970
professionally with your JavaScript but

92
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:20,360
that was my experience I was really

93
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,760
approaching my wit's end because

94
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,980
separately from this sea of tumbleweeds

95
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:27,170
that was passing over my desktop I was

96
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:28,550
really in my wit's end with the

97
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:30,650
technology itself for reasons that we

98
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:33,580
can talk about later when i'm drunk but

99
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:39,410
luckily i was going to NYC jazz with my

100
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:42,830
former roommate or NYC jas doesn't exist

101
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:44,990
anymore but it was a meetup that was

102
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:47,840
organized by a guy named by mitchell so

103
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:51,320
combined with that meet up and Ryan

104
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:54,380
dolls talk from JS confi you in 2009

105
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:56,810
javascript had really started to capture

106
00:04:56,810 --> 00:04:59,750
my attention and I started dabbling with

107
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:02,390
it I was battling with it as part of my

108
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:05,630
research at Columbia which happened to

109
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:07,910
take me down to Washington DC quite

110
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:10,850
frequently to do research at the Museum

111
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:13,850
of Natural History so that weekend in

112
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:17,120
April just by chance i was there i

113
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,250
didn't have a master plan I didn't know

114
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:22,400
it was going to happen so I figured why

115
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:26,270
the hell not so I'm there I masker

116
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:28,880
become my roommates trying to win a

117
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:29,969
ticket

118
00:05:29,969 --> 00:05:33,389
and I met these people and you know

119
00:05:33,389 --> 00:05:35,369
based on my previous experiences the.net

120
00:05:35,369 --> 00:05:37,409
community I wasn't expecting very much

121
00:05:37,409 --> 00:05:40,829
so I was totally blown away like utterly

122
00:05:40,829 --> 00:05:44,579
and completely you know not just because

123
00:05:44,579 --> 00:05:49,199
of that but but it was it was the

124
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:52,079
feeling of belonging that I had been

125
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:55,499
looking for so at the end of this quite

126
00:05:55,499 --> 00:05:58,019
frankly you know my feelings about

127
00:05:58,019 --> 00:06:01,319
JavaScript and JS conf were awesome you

128
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:03,269
know like I went home and I was inspired

129
00:06:03,269 --> 00:06:07,769
and motivated and I eventually had to go

130
00:06:07,769 --> 00:06:10,019
home and I knew that there was something

131
00:06:10,019 --> 00:06:12,839
that I had to do I just didn't really

132
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:14,969
know what that was and I certainly

133
00:06:14,969 --> 00:06:17,129
didn't think that a domain name that I

134
00:06:17,129 --> 00:06:20,209
would register literally two days later

135
00:06:20,209 --> 00:06:22,259
literally two days later would be

136
00:06:22,259 --> 00:06:24,509
incredibly important to the next you

137
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:27,119
know five or so years of my life and

138
00:06:27,119 --> 00:06:29,429
that was for anyone who's looked us up

139
00:06:29,429 --> 00:06:31,619
or read my talk description no juicy

140
00:06:31,619 --> 00:06:35,099
calm and so at this point I believe in

141
00:06:35,099 --> 00:06:37,439
JavaScript I believed in node all thanks

142
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:40,019
to jazz conf so it was off to a pretty

143
00:06:40,019 --> 00:06:42,269
good start and I was also absolutely

144
00:06:42,269 --> 00:06:48,059
taken by the community so that was just

145
00:06:48,059 --> 00:06:50,339
the beginning over the course of the

146
00:06:50,339 --> 00:06:53,819
next year I don't deep into JavaScript

147
00:06:53,819 --> 00:06:56,189
and node writing open source and meeting

148
00:06:56,189 --> 00:06:59,610
everyone I could on the internet and at

149
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:02,639
NYC Jas and it was during this time that

150
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:07,649
I met this gentleman Michael Rogers my

151
00:07:07,649 --> 00:07:10,019
mic was too off there we go thank you

152
00:07:10,019 --> 00:07:15,119
Chris at this point in 2011 Chris and

153
00:07:15,119 --> 00:07:16,319
Michael were already working on

154
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:20,279
something called note cuff and because

155
00:07:20,279 --> 00:07:21,809
of no Jitsu and because of the work I

156
00:07:21,809 --> 00:07:24,659
was doing I happened to be running node

157
00:07:24,659 --> 00:07:26,639
in production at a time when I probably

158
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:29,610
shouldn't have been which pretty often

159
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:33,209
ended up like this but whenever you got

160
00:07:33,209 --> 00:07:36,329
it right it totally felt like you know

161
00:07:36,329 --> 00:07:38,189
just the best thing every time you got a

162
00:07:38,189 --> 00:07:39,629
system working in production it was a

163
00:07:39,629 --> 00:07:42,779
huge huge rush for me anyway which is

164
00:07:42,779 --> 00:07:43,710
why I ended up

165
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:47,130
writing so much open source and because

166
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:49,080
I think it's important but more on that

167
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:53,550
later so strangely enough to me anyway I

168
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:56,910
was invited to speak at node conf and at

169
00:07:56,910 --> 00:07:58,800
node come I did what I think a lot of

170
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:03,120
people do which is a big reveal and that

171
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,820
software nobody even uses it anymore in

172
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:08,910
fact it's been formally deprecated like

173
00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:11,820
so many other technologies that get

174
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:13,590
introduced at conferences they fade into

175
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:15,870
the background the software wasn't and

176
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:18,780
isn't important what we were doing was

177
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:20,850
important and the people we were doing

178
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:23,520
if it was important and that is again

179
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:29,150
open source it's about contributing and

180
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:32,400
with whatever people you share that

181
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:35,280
interest with and we contributed a lot

182
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,900
to open source identity myself

183
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:39,180
especially with a ton of other really

184
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:41,640
amazing people and I did this because

185
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:44,100
besides the work being compelling I felt

186
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:45,240
that there was like a moral obligation

187
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:48,300
to do good things and you can just

188
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:50,130
totally blame this on pop culture

189
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:52,320
brainwashing me as a little kid because

190
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,210
for sure my favorite superhero is

191
00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:56,550
spider-man & foreshore this got drilled

192
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:59,190
into me my whole life and you know I

193
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:00,960
actually prefer the reboot version of

194
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,880
this which actually is like a thing you

195
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,110
can like take home and feel good about

196
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:05,970
like if you can do good things for other

197
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:07,230
people then you have a moral obligation

198
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:10,980
to do those things plus it's you know so

199
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:12,150
that's sort of where I ended up

200
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:15,660
obligation responsibility and that's why

201
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:17,340
I decided to start an empire jazz

202
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:19,170
because i saw this community I wanted to

203
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:21,720
give back to it and I felt that way for

204
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:24,780
a pretty run-of-the-mill reason I'm from

205
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:27,180
there I'm a native New Yorker and I

206
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:28,530
think it's the best city in the world

207
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:33,640
and you know some other people do

208
00:09:33,650 --> 00:09:38,310
into the 36 chambers I kid but seriously

209
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:40,830
back in two thousand eleven and two

210
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:42,870
thousand twelve hearing the same thing

211
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:45,630
over and over again to everyone I talked

212
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:48,630
to about JavaScript and no Jitsu they

213
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:51,510
kept saying the same thing about the

214
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:57,870
same place so when you're from somewhere

215
00:09:57,870 --> 00:09:59,730
and you love it and everyone keeps

216
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:02,010
telling you that you can't do what you

217
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:04,530
love to do in the place that you love

218
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:06,510
you will get enormously frustrated and

219
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:09,660
you will do just about anything to make

220
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:12,540
that place a better place even if it

221
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:14,400
requires moving mountains for the

222
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,680
community around what you do doing

223
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:19,590
things like running a conference for the

224
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:22,800
first time and for anyone who knows

225
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,210
running a conference for the first time

226
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:29,520
is kind of like this it is complete and

227
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:32,640
utter confusion you really have no idea

228
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,950
where to start you know you want to do

229
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:38,220
it but that's about it thankfully I had

230
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:40,170
the support of Chris and Michael's so

231
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:44,190
that when I felt like this I could be

232
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:49,080
like this and then then the day of the

233
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:52,320
event finally does come and your back to

234
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:57,900
feeling like this but thankfully I had

235
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:00,600
the support of jas comp which of course

236
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:03,570
lastly meant time for the family photo

237
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:07,680
and then gates a wrap which for most

238
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:12,150
organisers means time to relax or if you

239
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:13,770
have any sanity left which this photo

240
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:16,980
shows we clearly did not then in the end

241
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:22,170
you feel like this or to put it in

242
00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:24,720
someone else's words I'm gonna let you

243
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,180
read this to yourself because I actually

244
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:30,690
still can't read it out loud even two

245
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,550
years later I still really can't sort

246
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:34,830
out my feelings what I do it was about

247
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:36,360
one of the organizers of the First

248
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:41,490
Empire j/s Luke and without Luke Empire

249
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:44,520
j/s 2012 would have never happened and

250
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:46,720
for those of you who don't know Lou

251
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,610
sometime in 2013 he decided to move to

252
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:52,580
oakland and some time after that about

253
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:54,800
two years after we organized empire jazz

254
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:58,100
together he decided to take his own life

255
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:00,350
and that is like one of the shittiest

256
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:01,940
things that you will ever have to deal

257
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:05,060
with for me especially because i don't

258
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:07,040
have a lot of experience coping with

259
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:10,100
loss but i do know how to run a

260
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:12,680
conference and if that is not both the

261
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:16,190
best and worst reason to run a really

262
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:20,450
good event i don't know what is so in

263
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:24,709
the words of the immortal raekwon i got

264
00:12:24,709 --> 00:12:26,690
with a sick type click and went all out

265
00:12:26,690 --> 00:12:33,440
so Catherine Lopez Juan Vertica Justin

266
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,510
Moses and Adam sonntag are some of the

267
00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:37,580
hardest working people I know despite

268
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:41,899
all their help deep down I was still

269
00:12:41,899 --> 00:12:47,899
feeling like this because what had

270
00:12:47,899 --> 00:12:49,550
happened only a few months earlier just

271
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:52,250
increased these almost crushing feelings

272
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:54,980
of obligation and responsibility I had

273
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:56,480
as a conference organizer to like the

274
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,300
near breaking point and at times I

275
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:01,310
really wasn't sure if it was gonna work

276
00:13:01,310 --> 00:13:04,220
but I kept going through my routine

277
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:06,440
because routine is really important and

278
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:08,690
attending the local borough jazz meetups

279
00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:10,760
that had it happened just a few months

280
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:14,209
earlier and it was at one of these that

281
00:13:14,209 --> 00:13:15,920
helped mold my feelings into something

282
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,830
doing good from such a terrible terrible

283
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:21,560
tragedy it was one of the suggestions of

284
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:22,970
the Brooklyn jas organizers Brian

285
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:24,920
Brennan who was also very close to Luke

286
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:29,209
to make a donation in his name so I

287
00:13:29,209 --> 00:13:30,560
realized at this point that I have a lot

288
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,990
of Brian's to thank in my talk but well

289
00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:35,779
we'll get back to that later all in all

290
00:13:35,779 --> 00:13:38,630
we donated about 3,000 3,500 dollars to

291
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:41,540
a suicide hotline in New York from both

292
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:42,920
conference revenue and selling some

293
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:45,440
t-shirts it still doesn't feel like

294
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,600
enough like I spent a lot of time on the

295
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,910
email chain with Luke's mom because like

296
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:51,950
I just couldn't couldn't do it for those

297
00:13:51,950 --> 00:13:54,110
who were there like I was just bawling I

298
00:13:54,110 --> 00:13:55,370
wasn't sure if I was going to do that

299
00:13:55,370 --> 00:13:58,700
today and without Jays comp I probably

300
00:13:58,700 --> 00:13:59,850
would not have known

301
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:02,790
Luke and despite the difficulty I know

302
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:05,190
that it made me a better person to find

303
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:07,680
courage to turn bad things into good

304
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,500
things depending on your point of view

305
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:16,800
of course so after Empire Jas 2014 I was

306
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,589
back to feeling like I was after j s com

307
00:14:19,589 --> 00:14:22,910
2010 I was very inspired and motivated

308
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:26,519
so I thought how about I start another

309
00:14:26,519 --> 00:14:28,170
conference that sounds like it'll be

310
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:32,190
easy oh wait a min it I forgot it's a

311
00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:34,620
ton of work so much more quickly than

312
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:37,639
before inspired and motivated became

313
00:14:37,639 --> 00:14:41,190
completely and utterly overwhelmed so I

314
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:43,290
went back in my head to some first

315
00:14:43,290 --> 00:14:46,410
principles expanding out and not up

316
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:48,420
having more events and not just bigger

317
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:51,540
events is the power of jas comp these

318
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:54,000
individual J Escom family events are

319
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,550
powered by new and motivated organizers

320
00:14:56,550 --> 00:15:01,529
and so found new people Catherine Lopez

321
00:15:01,529 --> 00:15:03,810
was back from the spring she was the

322
00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:05,130
only co-organizer who had the time to

323
00:15:05,130 --> 00:15:07,949
donate in the fall thankfully Tracy and

324
00:15:07,949 --> 00:15:11,819
Matt and Chris all stepped up to make

325
00:15:11,819 --> 00:15:16,259
Empire node a sweet success I have one

326
00:15:16,259 --> 00:15:21,810
pun one pun and yet the burnout still

327
00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:24,810
lingered it's it still does today even

328
00:15:24,810 --> 00:15:26,790
though I am being more responsible and

329
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:28,800
helping bring up other organizers to

330
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,519
take over when I knew I couldn't do it

331
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:37,620
whoa whoa sorry my fault this is the

332
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:41,839
problem with animations ah there we are

333
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:46,829
in fact Matt and Chris ran Empire node

334
00:15:46,829 --> 00:15:49,860
2015 just a few months ago with very

335
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:52,259
little work from myself and Tracy so

336
00:15:52,259 --> 00:15:55,949
kudos to them chris is here you can meet

337
00:15:55,949 --> 00:15:57,930
him so in other words i'm not in this

338
00:15:57,930 --> 00:16:01,649
photo for a good reason but the

339
00:16:01,649 --> 00:16:03,449
lingering burnout that I felt at Empire

340
00:16:03,449 --> 00:16:05,910
node when writing the abstract for this

341
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:08,519
talk and later when compiling research

342
00:16:08,519 --> 00:16:10,399
for it led me on sort of a journey

343
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:13,560
journey for a meeting in why every

344
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:17,340
one who runs a J's conf event does it we

345
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:20,870
tend to use the word community a lot I

346
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:23,250
myself have set it at least a few times

347
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:26,010
in this talk but to me it's it's just a

348
00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:29,400
word a word that's used to a point in

349
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:32,850
vernacular where it has almost lost

350
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:35,010
meaning i'm not saying that i don't care

351
00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:36,779
about people because the truth is quite

352
00:16:36,779 --> 00:16:41,690
the opposite but why does everyone do it

353
00:16:41,690 --> 00:16:46,589
so why are these people important why

354
00:16:46,589 --> 00:16:49,260
are they worth all this effort I'm not

355
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:51,270
saying they're not but I'm asking for

356
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:54,420
tangible reasons why just this past week

357
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:57,690
I rewatched talk that Chris gave a temp

358
00:16:57,690 --> 00:17:03,000
rjs 2012 called finding love in a bit it

359
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,350
was a talk that he gave after he had

360
00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:07,140
quit Twitter for like a year after days

361
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:11,010
calm 2012 he had disconnected himself

362
00:17:11,010 --> 00:17:14,130
from the popularity contest that many of

363
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:17,430
us including myself fall victim to the

364
00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:18,810
saddest thing about this is that i was

365
00:17:18,810 --> 00:17:21,030
literally in the room when Chris gave

366
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:23,520
this talk but I was so overwhelmed and

367
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:26,069
plugged in that I was not truly present

368
00:17:26,069 --> 00:17:29,550
for it or perhaps I was not ready for

369
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:32,220
the things that he was saying but I am

370
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:35,370
now and the best two pieces of advice to

371
00:17:35,370 --> 00:17:39,720
me were number one stop taking yourself

372
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:45,330
so seriously be silly not snarky and I

373
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:46,950
realized that I am not exactly the right

374
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:50,310
person to be saying this I realized that

375
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:51,990
I am perceived as a very intense and

376
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:55,290
serious person but being serious about

377
00:17:55,290 --> 00:17:57,210
yourself and being serious about your

378
00:17:57,210 --> 00:18:00,060
work are two very different things I

379
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:02,220
mean what kind of face are you making

380
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:04,140
right now kind of faces your neighbor

381
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:07,530
making are you smiling why not we try

382
00:18:07,530 --> 00:18:10,350
like one thing right now smile at your

383
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:12,300
neighbor like look at the person next to

384
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:17,870
you and smile at them especially you Tom

385
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:20,500
make make a funny face d I mean do you

386
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,780
do a mean mug do you feel different

387
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:24,880
about them now do you feel more

388
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:27,940
connected I do I mean that's that take

389
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:32,910
down the wall number to disconnect and

390
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:36,700
reflect even if it is for one day a week

391
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:39,640
even if it is just for one hour of one

392
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:43,090
day a week make it a practice it may not

393
00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:45,340
be easy at first in fact it may be the

394
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:46,680
most difficult thing you do all week

395
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:48,910
yoga really helps with that I know

396
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:51,250
people are not necessarily into that but

397
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:54,250
it does help a lot try something new

398
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:56,500
while you're disconnected go for a walk

399
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,830
leave your phone at home read a book

400
00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:03,250
talk to your friends in person build

401
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:06,130
something new watch a movie with someone

402
00:19:06,130 --> 00:19:09,550
you love following my own advice I put

403
00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:11,650
my focus towards reflecting on Jas conf

404
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:15,480
and I realized that the community events

405
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:18,340
that they create is a direct function of

406
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:21,010
the feeling belonging as actual people

407
00:19:21,010 --> 00:19:23,650
we can create so you can't just say

408
00:19:23,650 --> 00:19:25,060
community it will appear out of thin air

409
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:27,010
i don't think that it has here that's

410
00:19:27,010 --> 00:19:30,160
not what I'm saying but we just can't

411
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,810
talk about it like it's some giant

412
00:19:31,810 --> 00:19:33,100
living in the hilltops that comes down

413
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:34,600
to visit the townspeople every now and

414
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,630
then we have to build it ourselves

415
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:40,900
because if we don't who will yeah you

416
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:42,490
build it by being kind and helpful and

417
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:44,470
not getting into fights on Twitter and

418
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:46,840
not excluding people from events that

419
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:48,730
you have and having the courage to tell

420
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:50,620
those around you that it's not okay to

421
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:52,720
be exclusive because communities are

422
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,880
really fragile and precious and

423
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:58,210
something that's worth defending so I

424
00:19:58,210 --> 00:20:01,030
promised that my rant is almost over but

425
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:03,460
this last photo is one that I constantly

426
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:05,440
come back to whenever I search for

427
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,670
meaning I don't know if folks in the

428
00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:08,470
back and see it but it is the pale blue

429
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:11,080
dot a photograph taken by the Voyager 1

430
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:13,570
spacecraft in 1990 about 6 billion

431
00:20:13,570 --> 00:20:16,420
kilometers away from Earth and there is

432
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:18,460
an amazing quote that goes with it from

433
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:21,310
of course the immortal Carl Sagan which

434
00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:24,930
I can't do his voice but I can I can try

435
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:28,120
look again at that dot that's here

436
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:30,060
that's home

437
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:32,550
that's us on it everyone you love

438
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:35,550
everyone you know everyone you have ever

439
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:38,340
heard of every human being who ever was

440
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:41,760
lived out their lives the aggregate of

441
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:44,610
our joy and suffering thousands of

442
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:47,430
confident religions ideologies and

443
00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:49,890
economic doctrines every hunter and

444
00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:52,440
forager every hero and coward every

445
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:55,400
creator and destroyer of civilization

446
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:59,010
every King and peasant every mother and

447
00:20:59,010 --> 00:21:02,040
father hopeful child inventor and

448
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:05,210
Explorer every teacher of morals every

449
00:21:05,210 --> 00:21:09,240
corrupt politician every superstar every

450
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:13,080
Supreme Leader every saint and sinner in

451
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:14,940
the history of our species lives there

452
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:18,240
on a mote of dust suspended in a star

453
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:22,170
beam so let's continue to create that

454
00:21:22,170 --> 00:21:26,130
feeling of belonging and let's change

455
00:21:26,130 --> 00:21:28,040
the world let's keep changing the world

456
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:32,130
don't forget take this feeling home go

457
00:21:32,130 --> 00:21:38,580
do something with it and now Jana and I

458
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:41,130
have prepared a video montage which will

459
00:21:41,130 --> 00:21:44,970
just really drive at home even more I'm

460
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:47,850
sorry if I was a bummer but it feels a

461
00:21:47,850 --> 00:21:49,710
lot better now that I said those things

462
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:51,480
and if you're mad at me we can come talk

463
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:55,549
it out at the bar

464
00:21:55,559 --> 00:22:11,039
I'm here welcome to gencon Asia maybe

465
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:13,200
the priest confluences introduced from

466
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:16,169
underwater for me personally reject is

467
00:22:16,169 --> 00:22:18,269
way more than just a conference it's

468
00:22:18,269 --> 00:22:20,399
it's a very special place with very

469
00:22:20,399 --> 00:22:22,049
special people and they're all gathering

470
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:25,350
here and it's it's about much more than

471
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:27,330
just technology it's really about the

472
00:22:27,330 --> 00:22:28,619
people that are here and that's very

473
00:22:28,619 --> 00:22:30,659
very near to my heart so that's where

474
00:22:30,659 --> 00:22:34,649
Cascadia j/s came from it was heavily

475
00:22:34,649 --> 00:22:39,629
inspired by JS com JS con tu l xjs node

476
00:22:39,629 --> 00:22:41,909
comp all of the conference's that you

477
00:22:41,909 --> 00:22:44,249
think of as being the best of what a

478
00:22:44,249 --> 00:22:46,860
developer conference can be and we put

479
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:49,619
on this event in November of 2012 and it

480
00:22:49,619 --> 00:22:52,289
was just it was a huge success you know

481
00:22:52,289 --> 00:22:55,110
we pulled together just over 200 amazing

482
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:58,289
people for two days of fun and it was

483
00:22:58,289 --> 00:22:59,700
just one of the most rewarding

484
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:05,419
experiences I'd ever had

485
00:23:05,429 --> 00:23:09,580
javascript what are you what even is a

486
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:10,890
class

487
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:14,510
why should we care about any of this I

488
00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:17,100
give a talk about how I changed careers

489
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:20,130
in one year from no programming

490
00:23:20,130 --> 00:23:22,830
experience at all to a hired program it

491
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:24,870
was rough it was hard but my talk is

492
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:26,910
about how I got so much help from so

493
00:23:26,910 --> 00:23:28,470
many people in the community and how

494
00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:31,200
awesome that was and trying to inspire

495
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,900
other people to help out I don't know

496
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:35,400
the whole atmosphere is just so friendly

497
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,680
and welcoming and all the talks have

498
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:40,710
been great and just the people seem

502
00:23:56,910 --> 00:23:59,220
the LEDs will flash and it will drive

503
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:24,360

semi-colons on the end of every

514
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:53,780
instruction there are a few conferences

515
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:55,520
i have in my head as my favorites in

516
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,410
europe and this is my first time at jess

517
00:24:57,410 --> 00:24:59,390
convey you and it's right in at number

518
00:24:59,390 --> 00:25:01,490
one what's going to be awesome before I

519
00:25:01,490 --> 00:25:04,070
came here and it's just what I expected

520
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:06,650
and just a little bit more you topped it

521
00:25:06,650 --> 00:25:08,660
I wouldn't have missed CSS columns the

522
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:12,980
second edition for anything

523
00:25:12,990 --> 00:25:20,140
HTML had hamill and CSS hats s but Jay

524
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:26,130
has had just yes that was that last now

525
00:25:26,130 --> 00:25:29,919
CoffeeScript has brought us at ur style

526
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:34,029
of its own but there's just one little

527
00:25:34,029 --> 00:25:39,990
problem when every stroke

528
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:47,980
k

529
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:52,740
number hit in New

530
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:57,520
and it's enough to make mistake with

00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:07,560
JavaScript till source snaps land or

532
00:26:07,570 --> 00:26:34,400

so fiddle is fuck it do it live this

540
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:08,590
entire thing this weary moat is bridged

541
00:27:08,590 --> 00:27:12,810
down to an Arduino board spliced today

542
00:27:12,810 --> 00:27:16,330
that's bridged into Johnny 5 which is

543
00:27:16,330 --> 00:27:18,190
running nodejs that's controlling the

544
00:27:18,190 --> 00:27:20,380
Arduino that's reading from the we thing

545
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:24,820
that talks out to the node copter we

546
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:27,340
have bound every single button to do

547
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:30,160
something the start button appropriately

548
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:32,500
starts it and because we have a windows

549
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:34,690

good question and like frankly the

699
00:35:34,790 --> 00:35:36,620
community does not have a good ontology

700
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:38,780
around what object orientation should be

701
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:43,950
nor really what classes are at all

702
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:46,400
there's nothing that works there's

703
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,470

have to do that and we don't have to we

728
00:36:57,990 --> 00:36:59,460
don't have to do that

729
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:01,880
you don't rewrite your whole application

730
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:04,290
every five minutes and we don't have to

731
00:37:04,290 --> 00:37:06,120
do that you don't we write to your all

732
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:08,610
application every five minutes and we

733
00:37:08,610 --> 00:37:10,200
don't have to do that these are not do

734
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:11,700
you think so did not invent these are

735
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:13,320
not design of new things I did not

736
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:15,540
invent them you don't rewrite your all

737
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:18,000
application every five minutes and we

738
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,410
don't have to do that what's gonna

739
00:37:19,410 --> 00:37:23,010
happen after JavaScript and I I have to

740
00:37:23,010 --> 00:37:24,840
believe what's gonna happen after

741
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:28,260
JavaScript and I I have to believe that

742
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:30,240
there is going to be a next language

743
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:32,640
because if javascript is the last

744
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:34,890
language that's just going to be really

745
00:37:34,890 --> 00:37:41,100
