00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,140

i turn my camera on I could my fingers

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:17,550
on way so yes today I'm going to share

3
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:19,939
to you a bit of experience about Gaines

4
00:00:19,939 --> 00:00:23,189
aye lad that I'm not exactly an awesome

5
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:26,430
game developer I've made to gains one

6
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:28,560
which is very stupid and simple and the

7
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,029
other which I'm talking about is

8
00:00:30,029 --> 00:00:34,410
hopefully bit better so firstly the

9
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:36,510
slides are going to be up on speaker

10
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:38,280
deck after the end of this talk so

11
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:40,489
they're not there yet but they will be

12
00:00:40,489 --> 00:00:43,559
so a bit of an introduction about myself

13
00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:47,789
I am as mentioned from australia sydney

14
00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:50,010
where we're probably known for our opera

15
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:52,710
house and our beer and I work out

16
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:54,649
atlassian where there's beer on tap

17
00:00:54,649 --> 00:00:57,930
except I don't drink so I've been at

18
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:00,149
last year for the past five nearly six

19
00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:02,280
years and I worked on various projects

20
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:04,680
and products in particular booked on

21
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,900
confluence some of you may have heard of

22
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:10,680
that now as a developer I think how jobs

23
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:13,560
are very creative and therefore I like

24
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,360
to create things and I think many of us

25
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,720
do here as well but I don't like to

26
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,720
create just computer programs and apps

27
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:24,090
in fact I like to sometimes venture away

28
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:26,220
from the computer and create things that

29
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:28,670
are a bit more tangible like soft toys

30
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:31,680
but I find in the end I gravitate back

31
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,750
towards the laptop sitting in my room

32
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:37,189
coding away at some random idea I have

33
00:01:37,189 --> 00:01:40,680
so now that you know a bit about me let

34
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:44,610
us continue on our journey so before we

35
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:46,740
start on the journey let us start by

36
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:50,280
doing a quick survey with some audience

37
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:53,310
participation so put your hand up if

38
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:55,950
you've wanted to make a game or have an

39
00:01:55,950 --> 00:02:00,420
idea for a game come on yep so quite a

40
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:03,540
few now keep your hand up if you started

41
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:07,370
on this idea

42
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:10,540
bit more and keep your hand up if you've

43
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:13,240
actually finished this idea and it's

44
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:15,280
published so that people who you do not

45
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,890
know can download and play this game

46
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:20,770
because I think we've got two people so

47
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:23,050
as you can see there's a bit of a

48
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:25,570
pattern here and that is as developers

49
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:28,090
we like creating things and gains is one

50
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:30,160
of these things and I think the reason

51
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,530
for this is games is one of the rare

52
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:34,450
things that we can create that our

53
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:37,600
friends and family understand it might

54
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,640
be quite hard to explain to your friend

55
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:43,390
what a web torrent web RTC thing is they

56
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:45,490
might be like so I can stream videos

57
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:48,070
like youtube what's the difference but

58
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:49,960
with games you give it to them and

59
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,520
they'll be like oh cool I can play

60
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,980
flappy bird they understand exactly what

61
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:56,110
it's for without you trying to dumb it

62
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:59,650
down for them but the problem is there's

63
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:01,990
lots of ideas and we rare that they

64
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:04,330
rarely see the light of day and I think

65
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:07,840
this is a huge problem mainly because as

66
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,090
developers I think we're all very

67
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:12,370
talented and skilled and we have the

68
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:14,410
ability to create these games that we

69
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:16,989
have in our mind but life gets in the

70
00:03:16,989 --> 00:03:19,930
way and we rarely finish these ideas and

71
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:21,910
they just sort of either stay half

72
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:24,070
completed on a computer or worse yet

73
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:27,459
they stay in our mind going nowhere and

74
00:03:27,459 --> 00:03:29,860
that is why today I want you to I want

75
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:32,680
to I guess talk to you about my

76
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,690
experience in making my most recent game

77
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:38,080
trichrome on so try chroma is a simple

78
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,660
puzzle game where you slide the tiles

79
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:43,900
around you when you slide the tiles

80
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:45,580
around and you have three or more of the

81
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:48,040
same color that line up the tiles

82
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:50,470
disappear if you clear the board you

83
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:52,420
level up you get a new color it gets

84
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:55,239
hard up if the board feels up it's game

85
00:03:55,239 --> 00:03:58,269
over start again as you can see it's a

86
00:03:58,269 --> 00:04:00,280
very simple game it's completely written

87
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:03,970
in JavaScript HTML CSS and I use Cordova

88
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:06,760
to make it a native web app now I have

89
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,440
to give it a quick plug it is available

90
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:10,390
on the Google Play Store which is why

91
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:13,150
I'm standing here today not yet

92
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:15,489
available on iOS or Windows because I

93
00:04:15,489 --> 00:04:15,940
didn't

94
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:17,830
time but I promise you it will be there

95
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:22,450
soon and I think trichrome I started as

96
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:24,970
many of you will have guessed with an

97
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:28,810
idea so the idea came from playing two

98
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:31,240
or four eight and three and also connect

99
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:34,120
four so one night after getting really

100
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:36,580
frustrated at 2048 because I can never

101
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:39,400
get that 2048 tile and so I thought what

102
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:42,490
have I change the rules slightly what if

103
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:44,410
instead of combining numbers i combined

104
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:46,900
colored tiles and like connect four when

105
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:48,760
enough of them are in a line something

106
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:51,310
magic happens and so this was an idea

107
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:53,560
and I went to sleep and unfortunately

108
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:57,790
many ideas and here right they stay in

109
00:04:57,790 --> 00:04:59,290
your mind and you never get anywhere

110
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:01,210
with them they just sort of disappear

111
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:04,390
and collect us so the first step I think

112
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:06,220
that you need to do in order to get

113
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:09,100
somewhere is to do something with your

114
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:12,280
idea create a prototype have something

115
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:14,730
that you can play with in front of you

116
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:17,620
so with a prototype you want to spend as

117
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:19,540
little time as possible you want it to

118
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:22,360
be quick and hockey you don't want to

119
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,520
make the code look pretty you just want

120
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:27,850
something working so the prototype for

121
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:29,860
trachoma was a hacked up piece of

122
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:33,130
JavaScript done in a weekend and I can

123
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:34,690
promise you your code is going to be

124
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:37,120
horrible it's a prototype it should be

125
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,910
trachoma had global variables I had

126
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:42,280
hard-coded parameters there were bugs

127
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,960
but I could have fixed them because the

128
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:46,330
code was so fragile but that didn't

129
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:48,120
matter because a key thing for the

130
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,980
prototype is you want to validate two

131
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:54,340
things firstly you want to validate that

132
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:56,950
your idea works and secondly you want to

133
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:59,220
validate that it's technically possible

134
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:01,960
so in terms of idea you want to make

135
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:05,850
sure your idea actually has some legs as

136
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:09,340
harsh as it sounds many of our ideas are

137
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:13,120
actually pretty crap so you want to

138
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,190
create something quick and dirty that

139
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:17,530
you can prove that your idea actually

140
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:21,490
makes sense and on top of this once you

141
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:22,990
have something in front of you you can

142
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:24,669
give it to your friend or your flatmate

143
00:06:24,669 --> 00:06:26,710
and they can play with it and tell you

144
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:28,300
if they think it makes sense

145
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:31,180
if they think it looks promising and if

146
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:32,830
it passes this test you know you've got

147
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:34,389
something that you can spend more time

148
00:06:34,389 --> 00:06:37,720
with the second thing is validating if

149
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,940
it's technically possible now of course

150
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:43,150
in this day and age it's very rare to

151
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:44,590
have something that is technically

152
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:48,610
impossible right it's we can do almost

153
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:51,310
anything we want but the question is

154
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:53,770
more so can you finish this project by

155
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:55,539
yourself or maybe with a friend as

156
00:06:55,539 --> 00:06:58,599
you'll notice try chroma is very very

157
00:06:58,599 --> 00:07:01,419
simple it is very basically no graphics

158
00:07:01,419 --> 00:07:03,610
in fact it's just a bunch of colored

159
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:06,039
rectangles and that is because I can't

160
00:07:06,039 --> 00:07:09,639
draw to save my life I wanted to write a

161
00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:11,860
game in which I can play to my strengths

162
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:14,530
one of which which is not drawing in

163
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:17,259
fact even the colors I had to get a

164
00:07:17,259 --> 00:07:19,330
friend to select the colors for me

165
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:20,919
because apparently my choices were

166
00:07:20,919 --> 00:07:24,039
horrible so now that you've validated

167
00:07:24,039 --> 00:07:26,860
your idea is promising and you feel that

168
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:28,949
you can technically make this possible

169
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:31,810
you're on to your real adventure and

170
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:36,340
that is creating the real thing now when

171
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:38,560
you're making the real thing two things

172
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,870
to keep in mind firstly you want to

173
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:43,180
throw away or your prototype code it is

174
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:44,889
horrible code that you do not want to

175
00:07:44,889 --> 00:07:46,960
build on top of because you want to

176
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,969
start with a fresh slate with no

177
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:51,460
technical debt it may seem like a great

178
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:52,750
idea because you have something already

179
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:54,729
working but trust me in the long run

180
00:07:54,729 --> 00:07:57,580
you're going to hate yourself for it the

181
00:07:57,580 --> 00:07:59,710
real purpose of your prototype was to

182
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:01,360
get a better understanding of your game

183
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,699
idea and not to give you code to start

184
00:08:03,699 --> 00:08:07,240
with the second thing with when you're

185
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,830
creating your real thing to keep in mind

186
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:10,659
is you want to build a Minimum Viable

187
00:08:10,659 --> 00:08:12,699
Product you don't want to build

188
00:08:12,699 --> 00:08:14,169
something that has all the bells and

189
00:08:14,169 --> 00:08:16,330
whistles you want to have something that

190
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:18,580
is just enough so that you can have it

191
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:21,039
up there published which means something

192
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:23,219
that is just enough that is functional

193
00:08:23,219 --> 00:08:26,889
reliable usable and has elements of

194
00:08:26,889 --> 00:08:31,029
design and thought put into it when

195
00:08:31,029 --> 00:08:33,070
you're building your MVP keep in mind

196
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:35,440
this is not what you want to do you

197
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,940
don't want to build the tiny bits and

198
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:38,860
pieces and eventually just try and piece

199
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:41,390
everything together because I go

200
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:44,330
NTU some pieces will not work and things

201
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:46,900
are fall apart and you'll be in hell

202
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:49,730
instead you want to do something that

203
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:52,160
looks more like this you want to build

204
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:55,040
bits and pieces in such an iteration so

205
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,500
that you can test along the way the

206
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,000
first iteration might be something

207
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,030
really simple for example the tiles will

208
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:04,070
move and you can check for combinations

209
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:06,380
but there's no detection for leveling up

210
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:08,930
or game over the second iteration you

211
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:11,600
might actually check for game over third

212
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,550
iteration you check for level up and you

213
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:16,220
add that new tile color fourth iteration

214
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:18,740
you add score to it as you can see can

215
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:21,680
slowly build up your game so that along

216
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,660
each stage of the way you can do this

217
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:26,830
very important thing called play testing

218
00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:29,630
now play testing is something I highly

219
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:31,940
recommend you do as often as possible

220
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:35,690
and as early as possible the main reason

221
00:09:35,690 --> 00:09:37,670
for this is as a developer you're going

222
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:39,770
to know your game inside out and you're

223
00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:41,860
going to have a lot of assumptions and

224
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:44,180
play testing or challenge these

225
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:47,300
assumptions as frustrating as it is to

226
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:49,430
watch your friend sort of struggle

227
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:51,320
playing your game and missing the most

228
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:56,210
simplest and easiest rule it or all that

229
00:09:56,210 --> 00:09:57,770
means is you've made the incorrect

230
00:09:57,770 --> 00:09:59,540
assumption that people understand how

231
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:02,840
your game works at the start of your

232
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,940
play testing you'll notice that you need

233
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:06,350
to make some rule changes some things

234
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:08,960
won't work or you'll get some feedback

235
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:12,110
which will enhance your game a lot if

236
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:14,540
you just tweak a rule a bit and towards

237
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:16,220
the end you'll find out what confuses

238
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:18,200
your users you'll realize that if you

239
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,790
add in a tutorial it'll make it so much

240
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:22,430
easier or if you change the way the

241
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:25,070
scoring system works users will be able

242
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:28,070
to understand what it is so now on to

243
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:30,830
actually developing the game when you're

244
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:32,840
developing the game I highly suggest you

245
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:36,590
do two things firstly do something such

246
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:38,600
that you are learning something that

247
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,580
you'll find interesting and secondly

248
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:42,950
make a development process as painless

249
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:45,980
as possible so the reason I say you

250
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:47,240
should do something in which you're

251
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:49,880
learning is because at some point in

252
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:51,710
time no matter how excited you are about

253
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:52,110
your

254
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:54,360
current idea you're going to get bored

255
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,550
of it two weeks or two months down the

256
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:57,899
track you're going to have to implement

257
00:10:57,899 --> 00:11:00,060
something that is extremely boring and

258
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:02,279
if you're not learning anything along

259
00:11:02,279 --> 00:11:04,890
this development process you're going to

260
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:06,300
just put it away and it's going to be

261
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:09,510
shelved and it will disappear in terms

262
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:10,980
of making on develop process less

263
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:13,459
painless I think that is quite simple

264
00:11:13,459 --> 00:11:16,290
you want to reduce as much friction as

265
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:17,730
possible because you want to make it as

266
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:20,269
easy as possible to develop your game

267
00:11:20,269 --> 00:11:22,740
there's already enough things going on

268
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:26,190
in the world and in your life to make it

269
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:28,560
harder for yourself which is something

270
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,899
you don't want to do and as this slide

271
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:32,760
may have suggests you may have guessed

272
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:35,339
my suggestion for learning something and

273
00:11:35,339 --> 00:11:37,620
making it easier in my case was using

274
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:41,220
TDD or test-driven development so if you

275
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:43,709
haven't heard of test-driven test-driven

276
00:11:43,709 --> 00:11:46,730
development the idea is quite simple

277
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:49,500
instead of writing production code first

278
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:52,050
you have to stop and you don't write any

279
00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:54,540
production code because the first thing

280
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:57,420
you want to do is to write a test you

281
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:59,519
want to write a simple test to test a

282
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:02,310
tiny bit of functionality for example in

283
00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:05,760
track promo the scoring system I wrote a

284
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,250
test that said there's a combination of

285
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:11,550
size length 3 on the first level you got

286
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:14,310
to give the user five points now I wrote

287
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:16,170
this test and obviously it failed

288
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:18,480
because I had nothing that gave me score

289
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,360
so the second thing I did was write a

290
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,640
bit of code to make this test pass and

291
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:25,320
you want to write the minimum amount of

292
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,089
code to write this test to make this

293
00:12:27,089 --> 00:12:29,910
test pass and that meant writing a

294
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:32,640
function that returned five you're

295
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:34,170
probably thinking that's a stupid

296
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:36,089
function it's not going to work but am

297
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:37,980
ed test pass and that's the idea of

298
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:40,290
test-driven development write a small

299
00:12:40,290 --> 00:12:42,360
test and the minimum amount of code to

300
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,490
make that test pass and then now the

301
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:46,380
important part is you repeat this

302
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:49,709
process I'll write another test this

303
00:12:49,709 --> 00:12:51,630
time if you have a combination of size

304
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:54,839
for you return ten points and of course

305
00:12:54,839 --> 00:12:57,449
my damn implementation will have all

306
00:12:57,449 --> 00:13:00,440
failed this test so go back and i right

307
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,579
improved implementation a bit so it

308
00:13:02,579 --> 00:13:04,070
passes both tests

309
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:06,290
now you keep doing this refract this

310
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:07,940
loop and soon you will need to refactor

311
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:10,100
your code and this is why test-driven

312
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:12,440
development is often known as red green

313
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:15,350
refactor and after a while you'll notice

314
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:17,150
you'll have clean code that is also

315
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:20,270
functionally correct now this is great

316
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:23,360
on a lot of levels mainly because

317
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:26,090
test-driven development encourages good

318
00:13:26,090 --> 00:13:29,260
coding practice and good code in general

319
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:32,030
the test forces you to think about the

320
00:13:32,030 --> 00:13:34,580
code before you start writing which will

321
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:36,710
mean you'll have better code less bugs

322
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:39,230
and more and just better code in general

323
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:42,380
and also the tests themselves were

324
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:44,360
ensure that you don't fall prey to

325
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:46,640
regression if any early test if you

326
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:48,710
break anything the tests will go red and

327
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:50,330
you know you'll have to fix something up

328
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:52,820
so this is great with game development

329
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:55,880
because games have a lot of change in

330
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,740
them and if you have a suite of tests

331
00:13:57,740 --> 00:13:59,780
that will help back you up you have

332
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:01,640
confidence in continuing to write your

333
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:04,370
code and you won't sort of be wary to

334
00:14:04,370 --> 00:14:06,980
change your code and you'll be able to

335
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:09,050
code more easily again making your

336
00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:12,200
development process easier the other

337
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,150
great thing about games and test driven

338
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:15,980
development which may seem like an

339
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:18,170
uncommon pair is they actually fit very

340
00:14:18,170 --> 00:14:21,620
well together so the reason for this is

341
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:24,410
games have rules rules are

342
00:14:24,410 --> 00:14:27,320
specifications and tet specifications

343
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:29,630
lend themselves extremely well to tests

344
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:31,730
in fact if you think of the jasmine

345
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:33,490
testing framework it gets you to write

346
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:36,860
specifications and not tests so as an

347
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:39,560
example try Kromah has a simple rule if

348
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:42,710
the grid is full then it's game over and

349
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:45,290
as you can see this translates pretty

350
00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:49,610
much exactly to as jasmine test you

351
00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:51,500
described that the grid should know when

352
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,420
it's full because this means you need to

353
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:55,720
do something about the game over state

354
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:58,640
another example you should grid should

355
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:00,530
know when it's empty because this time

356
00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:02,150
you need to do something about leveling

357
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:04,940
up now you don't have to just restrict

358
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:07,760
yourself to asserting the rules of the

359
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,250
game you can also assert things like the

360
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:13,910
behavior of the game for example the

361
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:16,040
grid should not allow you to add at all

362
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:16,940
to us

363
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:19,400
this space that already has a tower it

364
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,680
should give you a huge warning because

365
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:24,040
if that happens something has gone wrong

366
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:26,960
so by the end of the TDD process you'll

367
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:29,300
have a suite of tests that lets gives

368
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:31,340
you confidence that your game engine is

369
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:35,120
behaving the way you intended to and as

370
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,130
I alluded to earlier this is extremely

371
00:15:37,130 --> 00:15:39,020
important because your game is

372
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:41,540
definitely going to change all the play

373
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:43,220
testing that you are doing at the start

374
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:45,620
of your game you'll notice that you need

375
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:47,480
to make rule rule changes you need to

376
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,880
tweak the way that your games works so

377
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,680
that your system works in a nice balance

378
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:55,580
and this means refactoring your code now

379
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:59,000
without the suite of tests refactoring

380
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,740
will be a daunting task because you're

381
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:02,210
not sure what you will break and not

382
00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:03,980
show of your introduced regression bugs

383
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:06,290
and this creates friction and obstacle

384
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:08,330
to working on your game but with this

385
00:16:08,330 --> 00:16:10,520
suite of tests you will know that you

386
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:13,340
can actually dive in change the code and

387
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:15,350
as long as your test stayed green you

388
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:19,010
still have a working game if they may be

389
00:16:19,010 --> 00:16:21,410
bugs in it but at least it is exactly

390
00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:23,750
the same as you've left it before your

391
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:28,970
refactor the other benefit is this bead

392
00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:30,590
back loop that you get from test-driven

393
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:33,470
development so especially at the start

394
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:35,390
of your game when you don't have any UI

395
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:37,340
and the only thing you have is the game

396
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:40,460
engine and the logic this feedback loop

397
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:43,370
is is incredibly invaluable do not

398
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:46,010
underestimate the power of the red green

399
00:16:46,010 --> 00:16:47,720
refactor loop when you're developing it

400
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,790
sort of like this incentive that helps

401
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:52,310
you murder motive helps motivate you to

402
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:55,250
keep going and this brings me to a small

403
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:58,100
confession and that is i only tested the

404
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:01,550
game engine logic i did not test the UI

405
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:04,130
in fact i have zero tests for the UI

406
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:07,730
code and this is because i think UI

407
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:12,020
testing is extremely hard and as i

408
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:13,640
mentioned earlier you want to reduce

409
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:16,660
friction and there is a line between

410
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:20,000
setting up a lot of boilerplate code to

411
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,720
get your future development easy and

412
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:25,250
spending going down a rabbit hole and

413
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:25,709
try

414
00:17:25,709 --> 00:17:29,039
get something working so as annoying as

415
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:31,230
it is to have to manually test you I I

416
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:33,090
think it was the right choice because if

417
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:35,460
I did go and try to set up all the crazy

418
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:38,429
you I staff one I would not be confident

419
00:17:38,429 --> 00:17:41,130
that tests everything and two I'm would

420
00:17:41,130 --> 00:17:42,840
still probably be there trying to get it

421
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:45,890
to setup and test everything so

422
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:49,049
therefore to test you I I simply worked

423
00:17:49,049 --> 00:17:52,020
in what I was most familiar with the

424
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:54,149
chrome devtools now this is great

425
00:17:54,149 --> 00:17:57,360
because I had access to all the tools I

426
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,059
was used to the Dom inspector

427
00:17:59,059 --> 00:18:02,610
console.log the script tag to add break

428
00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:05,309
points etc I was able to develop very

429
00:18:05,309 --> 00:18:07,710
quickly as you will notice I've been

430
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:09,630
able to device mode on chrome developer

431
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:11,940
tools and that is because my main aim

432
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:14,190
for try chroma was to make it a mobile

433
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:16,980
web app a mobile app sorry I could have

434
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:18,960
made it a web app by adding in media

435
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,240
queries but I wanted it to be

436
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:23,850
installable and available for on the

437
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:27,419
Play Store and for this I needed to have

438
00:18:27,419 --> 00:18:30,659
some magic I wanted it to be as simple

439
00:18:30,659 --> 00:18:34,020
as possible to translate the JavaScript

440
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:35,580
that I'd written into a native

441
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:38,789
installable application and for this the

442
00:18:38,789 --> 00:18:41,299
magic came in the form of Apache Cordova

443
00:18:41,299 --> 00:18:43,470
so if you haven't heard of Apache

444
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:45,990
Cordova it is effectively a platform for

445
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:48,029
building native web applications using

446
00:18:48,029 --> 00:18:51,870
javascript HTML and CSS so Apache

447
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:54,960
Cordova provides you with a set of AP is

448
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,330
that allows you to access the native

449
00:18:57,330 --> 00:18:59,909
functionality from JavaScript and the

450
00:18:59,909 --> 00:19:02,370
great thing was Cordova was extremely

451
00:19:02,370 --> 00:19:06,179
easy to use do you simply create a

452
00:19:06,179 --> 00:19:08,340
Cordova project by running the Cordova

453
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:11,520
create command and it will create a file

454
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:14,000
structure that looks something like this

455
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,029
our Cordova provides support to many

456
00:19:18,029 --> 00:19:20,279
many platforms including Android iOS

457
00:19:20,279 --> 00:19:22,500
Windows blackberry and I don't believe

458
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:25,830
Firefox OS as well but for the rest of

459
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:27,120
this talk I'm going to mainly

460
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,200
concentrate on the Android platform

461
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:31,289
because i only own an Android device so

462
00:19:31,289 --> 00:19:32,760
I couldn't really test on the other

463
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:35,160
at forms but all the other platforms are

464
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:38,400
pretty much the same for example to add

465
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,140
the Android platform you run this

466
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:42,420
command you've got to run the iOS

467
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:46,410
platform you change android/ios when you

468
00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:48,540
do run this command what Cordova does is

469
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:50,850
it modifies this directory structure

470
00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:53,490
that you've got here and adds in the

471
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:55,980
Android directory under your platforms

472
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:58,290
and if you open the Android directory

473
00:19:58,290 --> 00:20:00,150
you'll see all the familiar Android

474
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:02,930
application folders folders and files

475
00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:05,580
that you would see in a native android

476
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:08,250
game or app so you have the

477
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:10,590
androidmanifest.xml you've got the

478
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:14,070
assets for your images libs resources

479
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:15,780
and resources directory for your java

480
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:18,060
classes but because we're writing a

481
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:20,600
Cordova app in JavaScript HTML CSS

482
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:22,860
you're actually not going to touch any

483
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:25,830
of this in fact in order to modify the

484
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:28,950
behavior of your application you're

485
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:30,330
generally going to be modifying the

486
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:33,420
config.xml file so the config.xml file

487
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:35,610
looks something like this looks a bit

488
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:37,740
scary because it's all just XML but it's

489
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:39,320
actually really simple and really

490
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:42,780
powerful so for example you want your

491
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:44,820
game to run in full screen you just set

492
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:47,210
the preference or full screen to true or

493
00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:50,190
you maybe you want the game to run

494
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:52,620
always important so when the user flips

495
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:54,960
the mobile device it won't change the

496
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:59,100
orientation yet another line so Cordova

497
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:00,810
will translate these directly to the

498
00:21:00,810 --> 00:21:03,720
native code for you you can also specify

499
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,880
the application name and this is what

500
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,860
appears under the icon that is on the

501
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:09,990
home screen and of course you can

502
00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:13,020
specify the application icon itself so

503
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:15,200
as you can see the confidant XML in

504
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,850
Cordova is extremely powerful it makes

505
00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:19,380
it a life easier when you want to

506
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:22,380
translate your web app game into the

507
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:25,470
native game into a native app and of

508
00:21:25,470 --> 00:21:27,750
course this is just the behavior if you

509
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:30,360
want to add functionality you can use

510
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,910
the Cordova plugins now the Cordova

511
00:21:32,910 --> 00:21:34,380
plugins allowed to access native

512
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:36,660
functionality like the camera or in-app

513
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:40,080
purchases gps accelerometer etc allowing

514
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,660
you to make a very powerful game or

515
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:45,580
application the great news

516
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:49,150
is most of these plugins are open source

517
00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:52,180
which means if it doesn't do quite what

518
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:53,740
you want you can contribute back to

519
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:56,740
their plug-in and enhance it or if a

520
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:58,390
plugin does not exist you're free to

521
00:21:58,390 --> 00:22:01,270
create your own using Cordova plugins

522
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:03,250
are almost just as easy as creating

523
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:05,800
Cordova project itself simply find the

524
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:08,350
plug-in key you want you add the plug-in

525
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:11,730
and then you can start using it now

526
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:14,080
since I wanted to create it as a native

527
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,120
app obviously I needed to create and

528
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:19,720
build the install APK file and again

529
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:22,630
Cordova makes it really easy by just

530
00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:24,400
running the court over build command and

531
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:28,330
to run it on your device as expected

532
00:22:28,330 --> 00:22:33,010
Cordova run so what this does is Cordova

533
00:22:33,010 --> 00:22:35,350
has basically meant that with very

534
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:39,580
minimal amount of work i can go from the

535
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:45,100
Chrome browser into a mobile phone now

536
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:47,380
it is probably at this moment that

537
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:49,990
you'll notice the app on your mobile

538
00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:52,240
will not look like the app on your

539
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:55,780
Chrome browser because the browsers on

540
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:57,070
your phone and on a device are

541
00:22:57,070 --> 00:22:59,710
completely different and as we as front

542
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:01,780
end is all no different browsers mean

543
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:03,580
different CSS quirks and possibly

544
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:05,680
different JavaScript quirks so right now

545
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:07,420
you probably want to right click on your

546
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:09,760
phone to try and change something and to

547
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,980
inspect the element but unfortunately

548
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:13,360
you can't right click on your phone

549
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,730
which means you can't debug but the good

550
00:23:15,730 --> 00:23:18,010
news is you can do remote debugging and

551
00:23:18,010 --> 00:23:20,770
it is extremely easy all you need to do

552
00:23:20,770 --> 00:23:22,500
is connect your phone to your laptop

553
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:25,810
fire up your app and then fire up chrome

554
00:23:25,810 --> 00:23:28,150
on your laptop and go to the Chrome

555
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:30,880
inspect tab and then select the app as

556
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:35,830
the window you want to debug and you'll

557
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:38,740
see something like this as you can see

558
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:41,770
there's the chrome web tools inside on

559
00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:44,110
your laptop and as you hover over the

560
00:23:44,110 --> 00:23:45,940
diamond elements it will hover over the

561
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:47,680
corresponding elements on your phone

562
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:50,290
itself now this is really cool because

563
00:23:50,290 --> 00:23:52,690
you can do everything you're used to you

564
00:23:52,690 --> 00:23:55,750
can modify delete add Dom elements and

565
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:57,639
they will be reflected on your phone

566
00:23:57,639 --> 00:24:00,249
I you can change the CSS as well set

567
00:24:00,249 --> 00:24:02,259
breakpoints look at console.log

568
00:24:02,259 --> 00:24:04,539
basically everything you're used to and

569
00:24:04,539 --> 00:24:06,309
this is an invaluable tool when you're

570
00:24:06,309 --> 00:24:08,529
debugging and making sure that your app

571
00:24:08,529 --> 00:24:11,169
looks correct on the phone so this

572
00:24:11,169 --> 00:24:13,149
brings me to the very key point and that

573
00:24:13,149 --> 00:24:15,489
is you definitely want to do device

574
00:24:15,489 --> 00:24:18,039
testing you want to remember to test on

575
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:20,349
a variety of devices in particular for

576
00:24:20,349 --> 00:24:21,759
Android because there are different

577
00:24:21,759 --> 00:24:24,659
screen sizes different performance

578
00:24:24,659 --> 00:24:27,879
different performance levels on each on

579
00:24:27,879 --> 00:24:31,029
each phone and this is because Cordova

580
00:24:31,029 --> 00:24:32,979
uses the webview so you want to make

581
00:24:32,979 --> 00:24:35,409
sure that despite the differences

582
00:24:35,409 --> 00:24:37,989
between your operating systems and your

583
00:24:37,989 --> 00:24:40,209
browser's it will look that and behave

584
00:24:40,209 --> 00:24:42,899
the same and one more thing and that is

585
00:24:42,899 --> 00:24:46,029
when you're swiping on the phone it is

586
00:24:46,029 --> 00:24:48,159
actually very different to using a key

587
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:50,679
to using the keyboard on your computer

588
00:24:50,679 --> 00:24:53,139
so you definitely want to do device

589
00:24:53,139 --> 00:24:55,779
testing it's almost as important as play

590
00:24:55,779 --> 00:24:59,859
testing so there's one small gotcha that

591
00:24:59,859 --> 00:25:01,389
I have to mention and that is with the

592
00:25:01,389 --> 00:25:04,479
Cordova docks so the Cordova docks are

593
00:25:04,479 --> 00:25:06,309
pretty good they're a bit of a hit and

594
00:25:06,309 --> 00:25:08,259
miss at times but in general they get

595
00:25:08,259 --> 00:25:11,589
you to where you want the gotcha is you

596
00:25:11,589 --> 00:25:12,820
want to make sure you're looking at the

597
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:16,029
right version of the docks so I was

598
00:25:16,029 --> 00:25:18,969
using Cordova 3.6 and every so often I

599
00:25:18,969 --> 00:25:21,700
would Google a problem that I had click

600
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:23,379
on the first link that google gave me

601
00:25:23,379 --> 00:25:26,619
and be completely confused and that was

602
00:25:26,619 --> 00:25:28,479
because i was looking at an older

603
00:25:28,479 --> 00:25:31,359
version of the Cordova doc so it'll be

604
00:25:31,359 --> 00:25:33,099
confusing because it's talking about the

605
00:25:33,099 --> 00:25:35,499
right thing but in a different way so

606
00:25:35,499 --> 00:25:37,329
when you're using these docs make sure

607
00:25:37,329 --> 00:25:39,070
you're using the right version and can

608
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:41,919
see that in the top right drop down this

609
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:43,419
will save you hours and hours of

610
00:25:43,419 --> 00:25:47,769
confusion now as with all things we know

611
00:25:47,769 --> 00:25:50,589
that development process is not all fun

612
00:25:50,589 --> 00:25:52,599
and games you're going to have problems

613
00:25:52,599 --> 00:25:54,940
and obstacles along the way you have

614
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:56,229
technical problems that you need to

615
00:25:56,229 --> 00:25:58,559
solve and life may also get in hilly way

616
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:01,269
so in regards to technical problems I

617
00:26:01,269 --> 00:26:03,279
definitely hit one as I was developing

618
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:06,279
trichrome on to the first and I guess

619
00:26:06,279 --> 00:26:09,159
the biggest one that I hit was this

620
00:26:09,159 --> 00:26:13,239
seeing here if you look at this you may

621
00:26:13,239 --> 00:26:16,570
think that it's great index CSS image

622
00:26:16,570 --> 00:26:18,429
JavaScript I can just open this this

623
00:26:18,429 --> 00:26:20,679
should be a web app and you can develop

624
00:26:20,679 --> 00:26:23,649
on your browser unfortunately this is

625
00:26:23,649 --> 00:26:26,649
not the case and this is because if you

626
00:26:26,649 --> 00:26:29,229
try and open the index.html here you're

627
00:26:29,229 --> 00:26:31,029
going to get a javascript error it's

628
00:26:31,029 --> 00:26:32,559
going to say something along the lines

629
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:35,349
of Cordova is not found and this is

630
00:26:35,349 --> 00:26:37,629
because Cordoba jayus is a platform

631
00:26:37,629 --> 00:26:40,269
specific file and it is generated by the

632
00:26:40,269 --> 00:26:42,099
Cordoba build command and placed into

633
00:26:42,099 --> 00:26:44,649
the platforms directory and its really

634
00:26:44,649 --> 00:26:46,989
only accessible when you load it on your

635
00:26:46,989 --> 00:26:50,349
phone that the index.html points to the

636
00:26:50,349 --> 00:26:53,139
correct Cordova j/s file now of course

637
00:26:53,139 --> 00:26:54,789
when you hit problems you don't just

638
00:26:54,789 --> 00:26:57,309
give up you want to find a solution for

639
00:26:57,309 --> 00:27:00,519
it so my solution was I wanted to still

640
00:27:00,519 --> 00:27:03,039
develop in chrome because I'd wanted to

641
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:05,499
make my dev psychol as easy as possible

642
00:27:05,499 --> 00:27:07,659
I did not want to deploy on to a phone

643
00:27:07,659 --> 00:27:09,999
every time I wanted to test that would

644
00:27:09,999 --> 00:27:12,220
be too much friction and I feel like I

645
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:14,919
would give up very quickly so my

646
00:27:14,919 --> 00:27:18,279
solution was quite simple here is your

647
00:27:18,279 --> 00:27:21,159
Cordova app and I wanted to not work in

648
00:27:21,159 --> 00:27:22,599
the cord / app and work in the web

649
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:25,539
browser so effectively ignore the cord /

650
00:27:25,539 --> 00:27:29,799
app create and put it under sort of a

651
00:27:29,799 --> 00:27:33,249
top level directory and create my web

652
00:27:33,249 --> 00:27:35,799
app files that I've used to index CSS

653
00:27:35,799 --> 00:27:38,019
image and JavaScript outside of the

654
00:27:38,019 --> 00:27:40,809
Cordova wrap so now I basically just

655
00:27:40,809 --> 00:27:43,720
modify and edit using these three four

656
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:47,769
sorry these four directories and files

657
00:27:47,769 --> 00:27:50,080
and I could open this in chrome and

658
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:53,830
develop as I'm used to and the trick

659
00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:55,659
here is when I wanted to test them a

660
00:27:55,659 --> 00:27:58,570
device I would copy and paste those

661
00:27:58,570 --> 00:28:02,109
files into the corner of our WWE now

662
00:28:02,109 --> 00:28:04,570
this worked great the first time because

663
00:28:04,570 --> 00:28:08,139
as developers I think we are all a bit

664
00:28:08,139 --> 00:28:10,450
lazy and copying and pasting files into

665
00:28:10,450 --> 00:28:12,429
directories isn't something that we want

666
00:28:12,429 --> 00:28:14,710
to do time is already very precious

667
00:28:14,710 --> 00:28:16,509
finding the few hours after work to

668
00:28:16,509 --> 00:28:19,149
develop on your side project and hobby

669
00:28:19,149 --> 00:28:21,279
and game is already hard so you don't

670
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:22,269
know waste these hours

671
00:28:22,269 --> 00:28:24,129
copy and pasting files and it's also

672
00:28:24,129 --> 00:28:26,229
very error-prone so this is where

673
00:28:26,229 --> 00:28:28,869
automation comes in and in JavaScript

674
00:28:28,869 --> 00:28:32,379
automation is effectively grant so grant

675
00:28:32,379 --> 00:28:34,179
if you haven't heard of it is awesome

676
00:28:34,179 --> 00:28:37,059
it's a JavaScript a strong arm and it

677
00:28:37,059 --> 00:28:40,089
lets you specify a config file and then

678
00:28:40,089 --> 00:28:42,969
once you've done the specification you

679
00:28:42,969 --> 00:28:45,759
only need to run grunt and run a command

680
00:28:45,759 --> 00:28:48,330
and it'll do this automatically for you

681
00:28:48,330 --> 00:28:51,279
so I used grunts to automate this copy

682
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:54,359
pasting by specifying a few

683
00:28:54,359 --> 00:28:57,669
configurations for my CSS and JavaScript

684
00:28:57,669 --> 00:28:59,799
so for my CSS this is what my

685
00:28:59,799 --> 00:29:02,320
configuration looks like i use the sass

686
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:05,729
plug-in created a Cordova task and

687
00:29:05,729 --> 00:29:08,649
effectively as you can see in my main

688
00:29:08,649 --> 00:29:12,179
dot FCSS on my top level CSS directory

689
00:29:12,179 --> 00:29:15,219
when I got caught the grunt plugin to

690
00:29:15,219 --> 00:29:17,769
compile the file I got it to compile it

691
00:29:17,769 --> 00:29:20,469
into the main dot into main dot CSS but

692
00:29:20,469 --> 00:29:22,829
under the Cordova directory effectively

693
00:29:22,829 --> 00:29:26,109
copying it into the correct place where

694
00:29:26,109 --> 00:29:28,419
I needed it and the great thing about

695
00:29:28,419 --> 00:29:30,489
ground is it lets user so specify other

696
00:29:30,489 --> 00:29:32,829
options such as I want the style to be

697
00:29:32,829 --> 00:29:35,739
compressed to save space did a similar

698
00:29:35,739 --> 00:29:38,739
thing to JavaScript using the uglify

699
00:29:38,739 --> 00:29:42,190
plugin created a Cordova task and just

700
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:43,959
said anything under JavaScript or

701
00:29:43,959 --> 00:29:48,459
library copy it into the Cordova classes

702
00:29:48,459 --> 00:29:51,099
and bundled these both of these tasks

703
00:29:51,099 --> 00:29:54,639
into one parent household pulled over so

704
00:29:54,639 --> 00:29:56,469
now during my development process all I

705
00:29:56,469 --> 00:29:59,139
needed to do was to run grunt cordova

706
00:29:59,139 --> 00:30:02,889
and edward compile and minify my CSS and

707
00:30:02,889 --> 00:30:05,019
my JavaScript and place it into the

708
00:30:05,019 --> 00:30:08,079
Cordova directory ready for me to build

709
00:30:08,079 --> 00:30:11,079
and run it on my device so this might

710
00:30:11,079 --> 00:30:12,849
sound like a lot of things but the key

711
00:30:12,849 --> 00:30:14,709
point here is you want to simplify a

712
00:30:14,709 --> 00:30:18,249
development process as possible the

713
00:30:18,249 --> 00:30:20,200
problems you meet might be different the

714
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:22,839
problems I've met but the key thing to

715
00:30:22,839 --> 00:30:24,369
remember is you want to make it as easy

716
00:30:24,369 --> 00:30:27,009
as possible for you so you don't have to

717
00:30:27,009 --> 00:30:28,389
worry about all the peripheral things

718
00:30:28,389 --> 00:30:30,129
what you want to worry about is creating

719
00:30:30,129 --> 00:30:33,579
your game and making it work there's

720
00:30:33,579 --> 00:30:35,559
frankly speaking there is not enough

721
00:30:35,559 --> 00:30:38,169
in a day to remember boring things such

722
00:30:38,169 --> 00:30:40,470
as commands and copy and pasting files

723
00:30:40,470 --> 00:30:43,929
now as frustrating as it is for me I

724
00:30:43,929 --> 00:30:46,210
have some good news for you and that is

725
00:30:46,210 --> 00:30:49,179
if you're going to create a native web

726
00:30:49,179 --> 00:30:51,909
app of Cordova you don't need to do

727
00:30:51,909 --> 00:30:53,499
anything of what I just explained

728
00:30:53,499 --> 00:30:55,720
because in Cordova for or they fix this

729
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:58,659
they fix this by adding the browser as a

730
00:30:58,659 --> 00:31:01,120
platform so remember how I mentioned you

731
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,759
couldn't open the index.html because

732
00:31:03,759 --> 00:31:07,029
Cordova jayus was a compiled version a

733
00:31:07,029 --> 00:31:08,980
compiled file specific to the platform

734
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:11,799
well now the browser is at platform so

735
00:31:11,799 --> 00:31:13,779
you can add it and when you want to do

736
00:31:13,779 --> 00:31:16,090
any testing you can run it and then you

737
00:31:16,090 --> 00:31:18,450
would have the browser as a platform

738
00:31:18,450 --> 00:31:21,759
once more word of warning is that the

739
00:31:21,759 --> 00:31:23,409
browser platform is still in the initial

740
00:31:23,409 --> 00:31:26,259
stages so there are a few bugs but in

741
00:31:26,259 --> 00:31:27,879
general I give it a quick run and it

742
00:31:27,879 --> 00:31:30,850
looks like it works relatively well so

743
00:31:30,850 --> 00:31:32,889
if you are at this stage of the

744
00:31:32,889 --> 00:31:35,379
development where your periodically

745
00:31:35,379 --> 00:31:37,840
testing on the phone and you're checking

746
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:40,149
and fixing up a few things it is time

747
00:31:40,149 --> 00:31:42,369
for celebration because you've made it a

748
00:31:42,369 --> 00:31:44,320
long way you've made it further than a

749
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:47,619
lot of people your idea has actually

750
00:31:47,619 --> 00:31:49,330
grown some legs and it's getting

751
00:31:49,330 --> 00:31:52,659
somewhere the problem though is the

752
00:31:52,659 --> 00:31:55,029
finishing line and this is the hardest

753
00:31:55,029 --> 00:31:58,029
part of all developing the game itself

754
00:31:58,029 --> 00:32:00,490
is challenging you're going to face many

755
00:32:00,490 --> 00:32:03,460
technical challenges but it is probably

756
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:05,649
equally challenging to make that last

757
00:32:05,649 --> 00:32:07,509
twenty percent and cross the finishing

758
00:32:07,509 --> 00:32:10,299
line so I'm going to give you five tips

759
00:32:10,299 --> 00:32:12,249
many of which I have alluded to already

760
00:32:12,249 --> 00:32:16,269
during this talk so the first thing is

761
00:32:16,269 --> 00:32:18,700
make sure when you're developing you're

762
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:20,409
always learning something during the

763
00:32:20,409 --> 00:32:22,509
development process because otherwise

764
00:32:22,509 --> 00:32:24,490
you're going to get bored really quickly

765
00:32:24,490 --> 00:32:27,909
and the game will disappear and be

766
00:32:27,909 --> 00:32:30,340
shelved now keep in mind and I think

767
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:33,220
this is something as developers we make

768
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:36,039
a mistake very often and that is the

769
00:32:36,039 --> 00:32:37,869
learning does not stop when the

770
00:32:37,869 --> 00:32:40,389
development stops you can keep learning

771
00:32:40,389 --> 00:32:44,379
even after developing so the act of

772
00:32:44,379 --> 00:32:47,289
publishing your game is learning the act

773
00:32:47,289 --> 00:32:47,600
of

774
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,160
getting your game out into the world is

775
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:51,140
learning getting feedback from some one

776
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:52,730
halfway across the world because they

777
00:32:52,730 --> 00:32:56,500
don't understand English is learning so

778
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:59,390
if you want to learn stuff that's more

779
00:32:59,390 --> 00:33:01,870
than just development publish your game

780
00:33:01,870 --> 00:33:05,090
second tip is friends are amazing

781
00:33:05,090 --> 00:33:07,490
they're great for being the first play

782
00:33:07,490 --> 00:33:09,860
testers you can continuously nag them

783
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:12,020
for feedback they'll get annoyed but you

784
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:14,120
can still keep nagging them and of

785
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:16,490
course they're there to push to help you

786
00:33:16,490 --> 00:33:17,960
and to encourage you there there as

787
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:20,000
moral support there's going to be times

788
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,010
and you just don't want to work on the

789
00:33:22,010 --> 00:33:23,600
game and they'll be there to give you

790
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,460
that small nudge that you need to just

791
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:27,890
cross the finishing line on a more

792
00:33:27,890 --> 00:33:31,130
technical level scope scope is something

793
00:33:31,130 --> 00:33:33,260
that is a pitfall for many projects both

794
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:36,770
personal and I guess work-related scope

795
00:33:36,770 --> 00:33:38,809
creep you've probably all heard about it

796
00:33:38,809 --> 00:33:42,380
is horrible and this is a chance as the

797
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:44,419
owner of your own game or project to

798
00:33:44,419 --> 00:33:47,350
limit the scope as much as you can

799
00:33:47,350 --> 00:33:49,490
especially when you're playtesting and

800
00:33:49,490 --> 00:33:51,110
you get all this awesome feedback you're

801
00:33:51,110 --> 00:33:52,640
going to want to add and change things

802
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,260
but you want to be careful going to be

803
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:57,559
strict and remember to work on the

804
00:33:57,559 --> 00:34:02,539
Minimum Viable Product you want to if it

805
00:34:02,539 --> 00:34:05,080
doesn't add value to the game drop it

806
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:07,520
remember even after you've you released

807
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:09,649
your game you can still add things to it

808
00:34:09,649 --> 00:34:11,780
you're creating a piece of software

809
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:13,629
you're not creating a building after

810
00:34:13,629 --> 00:34:15,980
version 1 point 0 you can release

811
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:19,669
version 11 and it'll be okay people will

812
00:34:19,669 --> 00:34:22,250
be happy with it and something to help

813
00:34:22,250 --> 00:34:24,440
us cope is to set yourself a deadline

814
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:27,320
hard deadlines work best so for example

815
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:29,810
the deadline for trachoma was this talk

816
00:34:29,810 --> 00:34:31,310
and this is why I'm standing here now

817
00:34:31,310 --> 00:34:33,590
because I had to get it published but if

818
00:34:33,590 --> 00:34:35,450
you don't have a hard deadline set

819
00:34:35,450 --> 00:34:38,450
yourself a soft deadlines a deadline is

820
00:34:38,450 --> 00:34:40,760
better than none so if you set yourself

821
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:43,700
a dot soft deadline make sure you get

822
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:44,750
your friends to hold yourself

823
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:49,250
accountable for it maybe set yourself a

824
00:34:49,250 --> 00:34:50,510
punishment if you don't make yourself

825
00:34:50,510 --> 00:34:53,540
deadline and finally last but not least

826
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:56,960
is to start just start on creating the

827
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:59,750
game start on the prototype get your

828
00:34:59,750 --> 00:35:00,870
idea out of your head

829
00:35:00,870 --> 00:35:03,420
it into the computer start on fixing

830
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:05,130
that bug that has been annoying you for

831
00:35:05,130 --> 00:35:07,230
the past week start on adding that small

832
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:09,660
little feature that will enhance your

833
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:12,090
game a lot i find that starting is

834
00:35:12,090 --> 00:35:15,870
almost just as hard as finishing if so

835
00:35:15,870 --> 00:35:18,000
as clichéd as it may sound i think if

836
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,120
you start you're halfway there so

837
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:24,660
hopefully many of you who have had ideas

838
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:26,640
either started or still just in your

839
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:30,000
head will now be a bit more motivated to

840
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,760
go forth and complete start on your idea

841
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:36,630
and see it through to completion so just

842
00:35:36,630 --> 00:35:38,970
one more thing this one final thing

843
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:41,430
isn't exactly critical to helping you

844
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:43,320
complete your game but I think it's

845
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:45,060
something that is extremely nice to have

846
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:47,490
and that is to give credit to the people

847
00:35:47,490 --> 00:35:50,040
that actually help you make your game

848
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:54,540
possible so in this line I know they're

849
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:56,880
not here but I'd like to say thanks to

850
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:59,520
my great friends Deborah grace and LeAnn

851
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:00,930
because they were incredibly supportive

852
00:36:00,930 --> 00:36:02,760
and they definitely played a role in

853
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:05,160
helping me finish the game trichrome arm

854
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:08,120
and also in terms of the slides I

855
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:10,830
grabbed art from these people who shared

856
00:36:10,830 --> 00:36:15,690
their awesome artwork and icons and the

857
00:36:15,690 --> 00:36:18,090
MVP image which was actually based off a

858
00:36:18,090 --> 00:36:21,390
Spotify talk so that is the end of my

859
00:36:21,390 --> 00:36:23,790
talk and I hope that you guys have now

860
00:36:23,790 --> 00:36:26,730
been inspired and had the tools to start

861
00:36:26,730 --> 00:36:29,070
on your game and finish it thank you

862
00:36:29,070 --> 00:36:34,980
very much thank you thank you

863
00:36:34,990 --> 00:36:38,050
and so we hope that next time when you

864
00:36:38,050 --> 00:36:40,090
ask how many of you have done it more

865
00:36:40,090 --> 00:36:42,130
hands will be raised thanks for sharing

866
00:36:42,130 --> 00:36:44,410
your journey because when you do it very

867
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:46,119
recently and share it immediately have

868
00:36:46,119 --> 00:36:48,940
so many things to reflect on a couple of

869
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:52,300
questions for Peggy especially those of

870
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:55,270
you who have been thinking about coding

871
00:36:55,270 --> 00:36:59,800
a game and not been able to do so any

872
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:12,160
questions over there I run oh yes i did

873
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:14,740
i'd be interested to know if you had any

874
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:19,119
issues with performance on mobile using

875
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:21,790
just the responsiveness of the UI or

876
00:37:21,790 --> 00:37:24,760
anything like that and how you dealt

877
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:27,730
with it okay um so for track promo i was

878
00:37:27,730 --> 00:37:29,230
lucky in that it was a very simple game

879
00:37:29,230 --> 00:37:31,780
there was there's no actual animation

880
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:33,490
except for when you slide the tiles

881
00:37:33,490 --> 00:37:36,310
which is maybe like once every five

882
00:37:36,310 --> 00:37:40,180
seconds i looked into it a bit and

883
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:41,980
initially I was using CSS animations

884
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:43,810
which I thought was more performant on

885
00:37:43,810 --> 00:37:47,380
mobile if you enable the 3d sort of

886
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:49,810
translate but Indiana actually went with

887
00:37:49,810 --> 00:37:52,510
velocity jas because despite using

888
00:37:52,510 --> 00:37:54,880
jQuery it actually optimizes it and now

889
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:56,710
mobile browsers are actually quite

890
00:37:56,710 --> 00:37:59,350
powerful to handle JavaScript animations

891
00:37:59,350 --> 00:38:01,840
and velocity jas does give you more

892
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:06,940
flexibility with CSS yep all right it

893
00:38:06,940 --> 00:38:10,810
and maybe just one more i'll get the mic

894
00:38:10,810 --> 00:38:17,740
to you what's the feedback been like and

895
00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:20,380
it has that affected the development of

896
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:23,910
the game going forward sir the feedback

897
00:38:23,910 --> 00:38:26,200
so the game has only been released for

898
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:28,420
about two or three weeks and one of the

899
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:30,400
things that I still am learning to do is

900
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,320
how to market it better so I haven't

901
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:34,930
actually had a great deal of uptake on

902
00:38:34,930 --> 00:38:36,700
it but in terms of feedback from

903
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:39,550
playtesting to improve the game during

904
00:38:39,550 --> 00:38:42,490
my development process the first

905
00:38:42,490 --> 00:38:44,470
iteration for the prototype was actually

906
00:38:44,470 --> 00:38:46,619
quite different from

907
00:38:46,619 --> 00:38:48,170
the final version and that was because

908
00:38:48,170 --> 00:38:50,940
most of my friends said that they needed

909
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:53,609
a goal for the game and that is where I

910
00:38:53,609 --> 00:38:56,160
basically changed the entire rules in

911
00:38:56,160 --> 00:39:00,180
order to I guess improve the game i'm

912
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:01,680
hoping i won't received that type of

913
