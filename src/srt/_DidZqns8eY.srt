00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:17,580

hi everyone so again this is polymer the

2
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:19,770
future of web components a little bit

3
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:21,539
about myself I've been at comcast for

4
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:23,699
about eight years now this is my family

5
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:25,890
we got my wife Sondra in the middle my

6
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:27,869
son feel and then we also have to

7
00:00:27,869 --> 00:00:30,500
international students Max and Abby

8
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:34,739
they're great so at my eight years at

9
00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:37,980
comcast I've worked on Xfinity TV which

10
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:42,120
is bringing premium content onto the web

11
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:43,949
and I say premium content so HBO

12
00:00:43,949 --> 00:00:47,039
Showtime stars Cinemax we were the first

13
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:48,839
to actually allow you to watch that on

14
00:00:48,839 --> 00:00:49,679
the web because there's a lot of

15
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:52,289
security that's involved and more than

16
00:00:52,289 --> 00:00:54,649
that just getting permission from the

17
00:00:54,649 --> 00:00:57,210
HBO and Showtime to be able to do that

18
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:00,089
is a pain in the butt I've also made a

19
00:01:00,089 --> 00:01:02,219
TV grid twice you know you got to put

20
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:03,899
the twice in there once for xfinity TV

21
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:07,830
and once for X tv.com cast net which is

22
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:10,979
the future site of xfinity TV and I

23
00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:12,750
currently work on Xfinity home for

24
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:14,820
comcast which is the security product

25
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:16,200
and we'll talk about that more towards

26
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:20,520
the end so quick survey how many people

27
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:21,840
in the audience raise your hand if

28
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,480
you've heard of web components before

29
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:25,710
great how many people have used web

30
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:28,800
components okay how many people have

31
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:31,380
heard of polymer probably because of the

32
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:32,910
talk you know how many people have used

33
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:37,800
polymer okay quite a few so again my

34
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,120
talk is polymer the future of web

35
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:41,220
components and I italicized the word

36
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:42,360
future because in order to talk about

37
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,310
the future you first have to talk about

38
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:46,800
the past that's kind of like the rule so

39
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:49,410
HTML was originally created by Sir Tim

40
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:53,520
berners-lee in 1989 and yes that

41
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:57,180
searcher Tim berners-lee not al gore and

42
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:59,250
the original purpose for HTML was to

43
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:02,610
share research documents as quickly as

44
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:04,080
possible right they wanted to publish

45
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:06,630
information to as many scientists and

46
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:08,940
get it out in the rest of the world as

47
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:12,120
soon as they could and it worked great

48
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:15,030
for that reason and for anybody who

49
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:17,310
didn't do the math 1989 that's 80s

50
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:20,370
themed the convention here that's over

51
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:22,050
25 years ago so if you were born in the

52
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:24,420
80s you are probably about 25 years old

53
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:25,319
or older

54
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:28,079
this was the oldest screenshot that I

55
00:02:28,079 --> 00:02:30,150
could find online that was available for

56
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:33,480
commercial use and this was in 2004 this

57
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,969
photo and this shows Mozilla before it

58
00:02:35,969 --> 00:02:38,579
was Firefox going down memory lane and

59
00:02:38,579 --> 00:02:41,099
next door next to it is netscape

60
00:02:41,099 --> 00:02:44,040
navigator and if we look back at what

61
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:47,340
the web was like this is 11 years ago it

62
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:49,200
was very flat it was just sharing

63
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,719
information and it had links and simple

64
00:02:51,719 --> 00:02:54,209
images and just leave you more reference

65
00:02:54,209 --> 00:02:57,780
Java appeared in 1995 so that's like

66
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:00,299
five years later java's pretty old HTML

67
00:03:00,299 --> 00:03:03,689
is much older and if you look at the

68
00:03:03,689 --> 00:03:05,250
last couple years what we've been trying

69
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:07,739
to do with HTML is build rich Internet

70
00:03:07,739 --> 00:03:12,299
applications at comcast we've been

71
00:03:12,299 --> 00:03:14,579
building xfinity TV like show this

72
00:03:14,579 --> 00:03:16,799
earlier today but this is a place that

73
00:03:16,799 --> 00:03:18,900
you can actually go online and view what

74
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:21,510
has been recorded on your set-top box so

75
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:24,090
we have this new x1 platform you record

76
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:25,859
a show you can go online you can

77
00:03:25,859 --> 00:03:27,480
actually view that show that you record

78
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,819
on your box on your web browser on your

79
00:03:29,819 --> 00:03:32,419
android on your iOS on whatever device

80
00:03:32,419 --> 00:03:35,400
this is actual shows that are on my sec

81
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:40,949
top box mostly my wife's stuff so but

82
00:03:40,949 --> 00:03:42,269
you know what we want to do is we want

83
00:03:42,269 --> 00:03:44,340
to take a closer look at this and if we

84
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:46,290
look at the mark-up of this it's still

85
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:50,310
using HTML html5 tags sections your divs

86
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:53,579
you know everything is just divs and if

87
00:03:53,579 --> 00:03:54,989
we look a little closer this is what we

88
00:03:54,989 --> 00:03:57,150
call an ex TV poster or poster art and

89
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:59,479
it's just the picture of the show and

90
00:03:59,479 --> 00:04:02,549
there's a list item which describes the

91
00:04:02,549 --> 00:04:04,949
carousel that's here and then we have a

92
00:04:04,949 --> 00:04:07,019
button the main image poster I believe

93
00:04:07,019 --> 00:04:09,060
is the button so that you can click on

94
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:10,889
it and it zooms in and then you can

95
00:04:10,889 --> 00:04:13,699
watch it or you could click options and

96
00:04:13,699 --> 00:04:16,199
it's just using your HTML markup that

97
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:18,829
was originally written for articles and

98
00:04:18,829 --> 00:04:21,719
the problem is like even with html5 the

99
00:04:21,719 --> 00:04:23,460
new tags that we got were headers

100
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:27,360
footers asides and it's still base for

101
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,070
like WordPress and publishing

102
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:31,110
information and not really for rich

103
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:34,199
Internet applications so this was a term

104
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:35,789
divin itÃ­s which I've actually heard

105
00:04:35,789 --> 00:04:37,830
like five years ago actually maybe even

106
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:38,790
older than that

107
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:40,200
which is in order to solve things you

108
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,730
just basically add more and more divs to

109
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:46,380
the page and it gets confusing and the

110
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:48,030
question that we want to ask is what if

111
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:50,760
we could change our markup to be X TV

112
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:54,120
carousel and we create an X TV poster

113
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,100
and we just give it the program ID we

114
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:57,840
put the relevant information into there

115
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,690
and that would become our markup and

116
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:02,400
what you get is you get a lot simpler

117
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,160
markup easier to read through and you

118
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,560
get reuse you know rather than having L

119
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,210
eyes buttons divs and all this

120
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:11,700
additional markup it's much smaller

121
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:16,110
Dom's too and essentially you're

122
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:17,940
creating building blocks you're creating

123
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:19,470
your own HTML markup that you can create

124
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:23,100
just a tangent whenever you do

125
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:24,630
presentations you actually have to use

126
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:27,120
commercially available pictures and I

127
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,740
had all these other photos in there and

128
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:30,000
I sent it to the review board and they

129
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,320
were like you can't use any of those

130
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:34,410
photos so my wife she's really great

131
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:36,270
with a camera and we have these blocks

132
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:39,510
that my son uses now so we got to use

133
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:42,660
those and so this leads us into web

134
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:46,440
components web components are they don't

135
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,330
really there's no spec for web

136
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:49,740
components is actually four different

137
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:51,570
specs that make up web components and

138
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:54,780
that's templates HTML imports shadow DOM

139
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:56,160
and custom elements and we're going to

140
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,430
look into them each individually in

141
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:00,780
order to do that I have enlisted a

142
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:03,120
helper this is my son again I'm proud

143
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,510
father he's one he's really adorable

144
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:08,610
she's painting the bud at bedtime other

145
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:10,700
than bedtime he's the cutest thing ever

146
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:12,810
so the first thing we want to look at is

147
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:16,560
templates this is jsfiddle for anybody

148
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,200
who's not familiar with it you put HTML

149
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:22,590
here you put JavaScript here any CSS

150
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:23,940
that you want here and this is the

151
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:28,280
output on the bottom right template tags

152
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:31,650
let you put mark up into the Dom which

153
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:37,170
is parsed by the browser oh yeah so it's

154
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:39,840
put into the browser wait I'm back in

155
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,830
full screen go back into full screen

156
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:45,570
it's put in the browser but the browser

157
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:47,760
parses it but ignores it so any image

158
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,140
tags that you have in a template any

159
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:50,310
script tags that you have in their

160
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:52,780
browser completely ignores it except

161
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:54,130
it parses it so that it knows what the

162
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:56,020
Dom content is and the only way to

163
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:58,570
access it is through JavaScript so you

164
00:06:58,570 --> 00:07:01,060
have to select the template you get the

165
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:02,830
content from the template tag and then

166
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:05,980
you can put it into the DOM and when we

167
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:11,889
do that we get a pitcher so that's

168
00:07:11,889 --> 00:07:13,180
templates and right now you're probably

169
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:15,940
thinking well that's great like what do

170
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:17,980
you do with templates and it's just

171
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:19,900
another building block that is really

172
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:23,380
not that awesome by itself but when you

173
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:25,210
put all the specs together you get

174
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:28,390
something awesome from it so looking at

175
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:32,710
HTML imports again by itself not that

176
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:34,570
great but it's the same thing as like

177
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:36,760
including a remote java script tag or a

178
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:39,100
CSS tag you do the same thing with HTML

179
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:41,650
you create an HTML file which just has

180
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:43,000
this template tag in there that I

181
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,820
commented out and now I imported it I

182
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:49,180
can get that link tag I can find the

183
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:51,669
content in that link tag I can select it

184
00:07:51,669 --> 00:07:53,500
and I can put on the page the same way I

185
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:57,370
did before and leading into the next

186
00:07:57,370 --> 00:07:59,680
slide we're going to talk about in the

187
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,890
page here I have a style color red for

188
00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:05,860
my h3 tags and the template tag has

189
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:08,320
color blue and when I imported this into

190
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:10,360
the Dom the problem is that it overrode

191
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,950
the styles that I currently have on the

192
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:14,919
page so this h3 tag should actually read

193
00:08:14,919 --> 00:08:17,140
but since the template i got inserted

194
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:19,539
into the dom it then read that style and

195
00:08:19,539 --> 00:08:23,490
applied it so it made it everything blue

196
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:28,360
beige this one which leads us into the

197
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:33,310
shadow Dom shadow Dom gives you the

198
00:08:33,310 --> 00:08:35,500
ability to take an element on the page

199
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:38,370
such as this div tag select it and then

200
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:42,130
create a shadow root on that Dom element

201
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:46,120
and the shadow root the shadow root is

202
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:48,820
basically its own little world inside of

203
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:50,500
that Dom element that you can add

204
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,420
content into that shadow root and the

205
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:55,600
styles will not bleed out to the rest of

206
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,550
the page this is really great for

207
00:08:57,550 --> 00:09:01,990
reusing HTML snippets so here we see

208
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:04,020
that the blue tag that was in that

209
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:06,760
template is applied just to this

210
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:16,000
tag and finally to bring it all together

211
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,400
we have custom elements this allows you

212
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:27,640
to create the Theo rocks HTML tag that

213
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:33,040
better I'll leave make it super huge so

214
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:36,070
here what we did is we use the template

215
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:38,170
tag but we're going to create a custom

216
00:09:38,170 --> 00:09:40,510
element in order to do that you call

217
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:42,730
object.create with the HTML prototype

218
00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:45,210
that's standard and then you get these

219
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:48,070
created callbacks attached call backs

220
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:50,890
detach callbacks and attribute change

221
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:53,920
callbacks that's all part of the spec so

222
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,200
as soon as this tag is read by the

223
00:09:56,200 --> 00:10:00,130
browser or on the dominant and yeah read

224
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:02,230
by the browser it calls the created

225
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:06,250
callback which will create a shadow root

226
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:08,500
for it and insert the template onto the

227
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:11,740
page and now we have our markup here and

228
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:13,660
just to show you this working we can

229
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:16,630
take the Theo rocks tag we can put it on

230
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:19,420
there multiple times Run it now we have

231
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:21,670
an exact duplicate of the Theo rocks tag

232
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:28,600
pretty cool so I actually have a couple

233
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:31,540
examples of this which is great to make

234
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:34,120
it a little bit more useful you know now

235
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:36,250
I'm going to do the Theo rocks tag I'm

236
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:37,870
going to add a source attribute to it

237
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:40,600
and so what will happen now I think I'm

238
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:43,660
big enough right is on the created call

239
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:46,600
back I'm going to get the image tag I'm

240
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,280
going to set the source equal to the

241
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:51,010
attribute on the Theo rocks element and

242
00:10:51,010 --> 00:10:52,480
then I'm going to append it to the Dom

243
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,150
so now for each Theo rocks I can have a

244
00:10:55,150 --> 00:11:00,400
different image on that tag yeah I

245
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,840
really like to show off the oh he's a

246
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:09,910
really cute helps a lot and lastly you

247
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:12,100
know this is just showing that custom

248
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:14,170
elements are just like any other HTML

249
00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:16,270
elements out there you can add

250
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:18,760
attributes to them you can put content

251
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,499
inside of the custom L

252
00:11:20,499 --> 00:11:23,709
moments and then any anything that you

253
00:11:23,709 --> 00:11:27,729
put inside of the tag is available in

254
00:11:27,729 --> 00:11:29,529
the template tag and you can select it

255
00:11:29,529 --> 00:11:32,049
using this content selector so this will

256
00:11:32,049 --> 00:11:35,799
actually look for the HTH to tag here

257
00:11:35,799 --> 00:11:37,959
and actually add it in in that specific

258
00:11:37,959 --> 00:11:40,329
spot and anything that's not selected

259
00:11:40,329 --> 00:11:42,419
will go to this fallback content tagged

260
00:11:42,419 --> 00:11:47,049
and this again is just showing the

261
00:11:47,049 --> 00:11:47,949
different stuff that you can do with

262
00:11:47,949 --> 00:11:50,019
custom elements as far as here's our h2

263
00:11:50,019 --> 00:11:52,589
will be put at the top my P tag will go

264
00:11:52,589 --> 00:11:55,779
down the bottom here and then the rest

265
00:11:55,779 --> 00:11:57,819
of the content that's not there goes

266
00:11:57,819 --> 00:12:08,349
down the bottom so that's awesome this

267
00:12:08,349 --> 00:12:11,919
was created by w3c specs Google's been

268
00:12:11,919 --> 00:12:13,749
pushing heavy for this Mozilla has been

269
00:12:13,749 --> 00:12:15,999
pushing for this I hope everybody likes

270
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:18,549
so far what custom elements can do it's

271
00:12:18,549 --> 00:12:21,489
really great but now you're probably

272
00:12:21,489 --> 00:12:23,199
asking i thought this talk was about

273
00:12:23,199 --> 00:12:27,009
polymer and it is we've been using

274
00:12:27,009 --> 00:12:28,989
polymer project for the last eight

275
00:12:28,989 --> 00:12:31,149
months at comcast we're going to go into

276
00:12:31,149 --> 00:12:34,479
a little bit of what polymer is and I

277
00:12:34,479 --> 00:12:37,149
asked my coworker what is polymer and he

278
00:12:37,149 --> 00:12:39,369
he coined the phrase syntactic sugar

279
00:12:39,369 --> 00:12:42,699
basically on top of custom elements it's

280
00:12:42,699 --> 00:12:44,709
not really trademark but it was pretty

281
00:12:44,709 --> 00:12:48,009
cool and essentially it allows you to do

282
00:12:48,009 --> 00:12:51,999
the same thing just another tangent this

283
00:12:51,999 --> 00:12:55,269
was done in polymer point 5 6 not the

284
00:12:55,269 --> 00:12:57,669
latest point 8 and point 9 which you

285
00:12:57,669 --> 00:12:59,439
have to use a little bit of JavaScript

286
00:12:59,439 --> 00:13:01,959
to define the element but here we're

287
00:13:01,959 --> 00:13:04,029
going to do the same theorist AG create

288
00:13:04,029 --> 00:13:07,209
a polymer element same template tag

289
00:13:07,209 --> 00:13:09,879
inside and now the browser just does it

290
00:13:09,879 --> 00:13:11,649
automatically this is what the polymer

291
00:13:11,649 --> 00:13:14,349
library is doing for us it makes it very

292
00:13:14,349 --> 00:13:15,909
easy to create custom elements with

293
00:13:15,909 --> 00:13:21,549
shadow routes automatically but it also

294
00:13:21,549 --> 00:13:26,259
gives us a lot more than this it gives

295
00:13:26,259 --> 00:13:28,720
us the ability to do data binding so

296
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,389
here I created an array of objects with

297
00:13:31,389 --> 00:13:33,249
just have a different source and a title

298
00:13:33,249 --> 00:13:34,120
tag

299
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:41,020
and we have a template repeat which will

300
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:43,750
take the model the Theo array loop

301
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:46,240
through it and this is automatically

302
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,630
data bound to the source attribute and

303
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:51,550
the title attribute is databound down

304
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:53,920
here so it will loop through the array

305
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:57,460
and print them out one at a time with

306
00:13:57,460 --> 00:14:04,920
the information that I have here and the

307
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:06,970
other thing that you can do with the

308
00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:09,850
polymer is interaction so here I

309
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:13,810
combined all the elements into one image

310
00:14:13,810 --> 00:14:19,870
and i set the model equal to just one

311
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:25,000
Theo here it is here's my polymer

312
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,730
element definition for Theo rocks and i

313
00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:31,210
set the Theo to be data bound to one

314
00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:34,089
index of the array just the first one

315
00:14:34,089 --> 00:14:35,980
and every time we click all it's doing

316
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:38,260
is updating what the model is pointed to

317
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:40,750
which since its data bound it's just

318
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:43,600
going to update the h3 tag here and the

319
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:47,260
image and every time you click it will

320
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:49,630
switch the image just by switching the

321
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:52,540
index in the array which is pretty

322
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:56,110
simple and here's how you do one click

323
00:14:56,110 --> 00:14:58,300
handlers in polymer so you just tell it

324
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:01,410
on dash click or one dash tap or on dash

325
00:15:01,410 --> 00:15:04,300
whatever event you want to handle what

326
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:06,240
function it should call to handle it and

327
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:09,250
then in the polymer element it will call

328
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:19,430
this on click function and execute it

329
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:23,970
and so this X TV carousel is definitely

330
00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:26,310
possible today with web components it's

331
00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:28,050
definitely something that we should be

332
00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:30,240
doing because it's a lot easier to reuse

333
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:34,320
pieces and it gives us a lot of great

334
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,540
benefits when you can reuse markup in

335
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:39,180
HTML a lot of things that other

336
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:41,430
languages take for granted if you've

337
00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:44,220
been using Ruby or node you have package

338
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:45,840
managers you could just download some

339
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:48,930
code and rerun it sure we use JavaScript

340
00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:51,150
and CSS all the time one thing that

341
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:53,010
we're asked all the time at comcast is

342
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:54,660
hey I want to create a new carousel

343
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:57,000
right so you want to take carousel from

344
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,250
one site and put on another site and so

345
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:00,810
the first thing we do as developers is

346
00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:02,940
we go look for that carousel on that

347
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:05,400
other site we copy the JavaScript for it

348
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,470
and we look at the CSS we try to copy

349
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:09,390
some of the CSS then we look at the

350
00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:10,590
markup and then we miss one of the

351
00:16:10,590 --> 00:16:12,300
markup and then it's like it's such a

352
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:15,870
pain in the butt and the big piece here

353
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:18,150
is the reusability right is that we can

354
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:20,250
now take something like xdd carousel

355
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:22,410
drop it on another site and it will just

356
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:24,030
work the exact same way as it does in

357
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:27,360
the first site and it's great because

358
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,070
before there was no way to really

359
00:16:29,070 --> 00:16:32,070
repackage HTML Javascript and CSS all

360
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:34,830
together you could do it one but not all

361
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:39,270
three together and now there is and why

362
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:41,820
is this important so the main reason why

363
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:43,650
it's important that comcast is worried

364
00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:45,480
like I said I worked on the Xfinity home

365
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:48,780
project and we're building these pieces

366
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:51,030
this is your arm ability in your home

367
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:53,820
Xfinity home is a security system so if

368
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:56,130
anybody has like Brinks home security or

369
00:16:56,130 --> 00:16:57,900
if anybody here has comcast home

370
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:00,240
security you arm your house when you

371
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,339
leave it has door sensors which sets off

372
00:17:02,339 --> 00:17:06,630
an alarm home security system so what we

373
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:09,810
built is this is a polymer web component

374
00:17:09,810 --> 00:17:11,850
and we want to be able to take this web

375
00:17:11,850 --> 00:17:14,520
component and drop it onto another site

376
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:17,640
in the comcast sphere of websites so we

377
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,230
have xfinity com which is the main

378
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:20,910
portal that a lot of our subscribers go

379
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:23,010
to we want to be able to take the custom

380
00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:24,390
elements that we built and just put it

381
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:25,829
right into our website and allow our

382
00:17:25,829 --> 00:17:27,750
customers to use it so wouldn't it be

383
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:29,010
nice if you just went to the portal and

384
00:17:29,010 --> 00:17:30,360
you can see whether your house is secure

385
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:32,220
what lights are on

386
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:37,169
and so that really leads us to rethink

387
00:17:37,169 --> 00:17:41,669
how we do web development and if we take

388
00:17:41,669 --> 00:17:43,020
a look at what Google's been doing

389
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:45,350
anybody see their material design

390
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:48,179
they've been spending a lot of time

391
00:17:48,179 --> 00:17:51,059
thinking how do we make responsive web

392
00:17:51,059 --> 00:17:52,440
that looks the same on all different

393
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:54,840
platforms and on iOS and Android and

394
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:58,320
even like they're new in box replacement

395
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,900
for gmail has the same header that you

396
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:02,970
see on your web as you see on your

397
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:06,360
mobile platform and its really great how

398
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:07,679
they're they're challenging to be able

399
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:11,490
to reuse components and at comcast we're

400
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:13,970
doing the same thing with Xfinity home

401
00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:19,799
so here's my session timeout we'll see

402
00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:21,210
how many people are using Wi-Fi right

403
00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:27,809
now give that a second like I said we

404
00:18:27,809 --> 00:18:29,309
started this project about eight months

405
00:18:29,309 --> 00:18:31,230
ago I'm going to be more than happy to

406
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:32,789
talk to any bit about this after the

407
00:18:32,789 --> 00:18:34,140
talk if anybody wants to know more about

408
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:37,590
this project every element on this page

409
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:40,559
is a polymer element so if we just

410
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:43,440
inspect this it's kind of interesting to

411
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:48,419
rethink how we do web development when

412
00:18:48,419 --> 00:18:51,080
everything is a web component or a

413
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:53,909
polymer element so we have an X H over

414
00:18:53,909 --> 00:18:55,620
your tile arm and the great thing is we

415
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:58,320
can write this once and if we wanted to

416
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,970
put it on another piece of the site we

417
00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:01,140
could just do it we could just drop that

418
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,210
tag in and it exists and you could use

419
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:06,500
it in the same way that you could hear

420
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:11,250
so what we learned we really have to

421
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:13,980
rethink how we do web development we had

422
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:16,110
a lot of interesting problems that we

423
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:17,580
had to solve starting this eight months

424
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:20,429
ago first thing is like what should be a

425
00:19:20,429 --> 00:19:22,650
web component when you build a whole

426
00:19:22,650 --> 00:19:26,669
site from scratch you're like okay each

427
00:19:26,669 --> 00:19:29,159
page is now a web component so when you

428
00:19:29,159 --> 00:19:33,210
click on overview that actually loads XH

429
00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:34,940
page overview which is a web component

430
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:38,940
into XH app so this whole app is just X

431
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:41,159
a chap you can actually drop that tag on

432
00:19:41,159 --> 00:19:42,840
another page and it will render the same

433
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:45,800
way this does

434
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:47,360
interesting we had a lot of

435
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,560
philosophical talks about what web

436
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:50,970
components should be what shouldn't be

437
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:52,740
there are other problems that you run

438
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:54,390
into there's no native support for

439
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:56,760
shadow Dom yet except in chrome and

440
00:19:56,760 --> 00:20:01,650
opera firefox has somewhat native

441
00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:03,210
support for tour I think they're just

442
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:05,460
putting it in now but then there's all

443
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:07,140
kinds of bugs with like the host element

444
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:09,450
and deep selector you're actually able

445
00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:12,270
to set CSS styles to change what the

446
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:15,660
looks of web components are another

447
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:17,370
problem we ran into was testing when we

448
00:20:17,370 --> 00:20:19,560
first started this web component tester

449
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:22,290
did not exist for the polymer library

450
00:20:22,290 --> 00:20:24,570
sweet yet so we were like how do you

451
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:26,820
test this we tried looking in selenium

452
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:28,890
and selenium didn't have any support for

453
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:30,870
shadow Dom yet so we were trying to

454
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:32,100
click on elements and you just couldn't

455
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:37,500
access them a lot of fun including a

456
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,450
JavaScript library was a big one moment

457
00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:41,340
jsuis were not using required guess

458
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:43,200
everybody today just users required yes

459
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,640
and you're going to have a library just

460
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,980
import it and reuse everywhere with this

461
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:49,320
you actually have to take script tag you

462
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:52,080
put it in an HTML document that you HTML

463
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,480
import that document it gets loaded once

464
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,490
by the browser and it's in the global

465
00:20:56,490 --> 00:20:58,530
window space so then it can be used by

466
00:20:58,530 --> 00:21:01,770
all web components yet another fun

467
00:21:01,770 --> 00:21:03,960
problem another problem we had was a

468
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:06,270
logger how do you have one function

469
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:08,010
shared across all the web components

470
00:21:08,010 --> 00:21:12,060
that exist find interesting solutions

471
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:14,040
for that and then the vulcanized build

472
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:15,540
process also wasn't there when we

473
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:17,550
started and that's just the ability to

474
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:19,530
take all the web components and the HTML

475
00:21:19,530 --> 00:21:21,600
imports and it parses through all them

476
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,850
and build it into one package so our

477
00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:26,220
whole web site is now like 250 kilobytes

478
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:28,200
and you download one single file and

479
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,390
that's the whole app it's a single page

480
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:34,920
app there are a few limitations with

481
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:38,010
using polymer it's IA 10 and above it

482
00:21:38,010 --> 00:21:40,770
does not work in IE 9 which was fine for

483
00:21:40,770 --> 00:21:42,810
us because we use web sockets and 99

484
00:21:42,810 --> 00:21:45,060
does not natively support web sockets so

485
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:46,170
we were happy with that that we didn't

486
00:21:46,170 --> 00:21:49,800
have to support IE 9 when we start it

487
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:52,680
was 0 point 5 6 so our whole app is

488
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:54,930
written in point 5 6 and since then

489
00:21:54,930 --> 00:21:56,880
their nail at point nine which is a

490
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,440
complete rewrite that we're going to

491
00:21:58,440 --> 00:21:58,800
have to

492
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:01,830
to migrate over 2.9 because the API is a

493
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:04,380
lot different but it's ten times faster

494
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:05,840
or something like that which is great

495
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:10,080
and we had a lot of fun doing it so

496
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,690
that's it I think I'm out of time I'm

497
00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:14,070
going to be around if anybody wants to

498
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:15,960
talk more in depth about polymer I hope

499
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:18,420
you guys enjoyed everything and thank
