00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:17,940

hey yes I want to talk about SVG reality

2
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:22,160
and I might be a famous sculptor but

3
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:27,359
I'll make it entertaining so I want to

4
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:30,000
talk about this problem and some of you

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,399
orbit over like myself would remember

6
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:34,739
that the web needs to be 1024 and

7
00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:36,960
everyone was just doing 1024 big

8
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,570
question was do you do 60 pixels wide

9
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:42,180
I'm evening maybe a thousand if you're

10
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:49,110
like 960 there you go just like so but

11
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:51,090
sort of things have changed a lot we've

12
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:52,920
gone from desktop computers with CRT

13
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:55,620
monitors it's all up with the same

14
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:58,379
number pixels to what is going on with

15
00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:01,350
these fixes devices have caught totally

16
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:03,090
crazy we've got every synchro leaf

17
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:07,110
resolution imagine not only that pixels

18
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:09,750
have now gone crazy and have more

19
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:14,490
pictures in them however that works so I

20
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:16,409
think I think I think we've better

21
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:20,820
excuse better languages and I think what

22
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:23,189
we really have have to work with is

23
00:01:23,189 --> 00:01:25,650
something that fits these new

24
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:28,049
technologies we need to software

25
00:01:28,049 --> 00:01:31,170
languages that fit the hardware that we

26
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:35,030
create we need something I can adapt

27
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:36,689
another thing that we've come up with

28
00:01:36,689 --> 00:01:40,110
like I said it's high DPI so that means

29
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:44,820
we've got more than one device pixel for

30
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:48,530
CSS pixel or pro logical fix and

31
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:50,549
suddenly all of our assets that are

32
00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:52,530
meant to look beautiful and I resolution

33
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:55,590
suddenly look not so high resolution

34
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:58,829
anymore you know they're the same assets

35
00:01:58,829 --> 00:02:00,659
somehow people have sort of gotten used

36
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:04,290
to expecting super crisp text and if you

37
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:06,180
have some good sex why you picked your

38
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:09,770
column at sharp sure you can just beam

39
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:12,760
massive assets down I is

40
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:13,989
group allemagne that you're going to use

41
00:02:13,989 --> 00:02:19,439
or or falls to do but it's not very

42
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:21,610
sustainable and it's not really

43
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:25,989
necessary for a lot of use cases I think

44
00:02:25,989 --> 00:02:27,340
it's better than the format that

45
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:32,530
stretches and when you think of that we

46
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:34,540
have had these formats for a long long

47
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:37,780
time we've you know we've thankfully got

48
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:40,209
rid of flash which was kind of like that

49
00:02:40,209 --> 00:02:44,560
but not really the best tool to God for

50
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:49,150
a wreath we've had things like SVG for

51
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:51,760
what a lot now CSS also has a lot of

52
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,319
ways to do that see there's a lot of it

53
00:02:53,319 --> 00:02:54,970
has a lot of ways and here's here's one

54
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:56,739
cycle one good leg off you're a lot of

55
00:02:56,739 --> 00:03:01,139
genomic which turns a single live into

56
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:04,680
any icon using a variety because hacks

57
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:08,310
using 2d elements and a lot of order

58
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:10,900
order drinks background tricks gradients

59
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:13,060
all over the place but I think that's

60
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:14,739
pretty much thing I don't think we just

61
00:03:14,739 --> 00:03:16,359
go like that I think it's really cool to

62
00:03:16,359 --> 00:03:17,889
be clever enough to come up with those

63
00:03:17,889 --> 00:03:20,079
things but we should not be using that

64
00:03:20,079 --> 00:03:22,829
it's not good software engineering I

65
00:03:22,829 --> 00:03:25,299
feel like we're kind of those we're by

66
00:03:25,299 --> 00:03:29,739
doing roof / CSS if you're familiar with

67
00:03:29,739 --> 00:03:30,970
that it's the concept of having an

68
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:33,040
extremely fragile machine that does

69
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,480
something really intricate it's

70
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,099
completely unmaintained a bowl put it

71
00:03:36,099 --> 00:03:37,180
looks pretty sweet it's very

72
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:38,799
entertaining it makes jewelry smart when

73
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:43,510
you like put it all together but it's

74
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:48,250
crazy right so instead of that what do

75
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:50,680
you something like as fini scalable

76
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,480
vector graphics that are pretty much

77
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:55,209
designed to solve this problem and have

78
00:03:55,209 --> 00:03:58,810
done so for a decade now for more but we

79
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:00,159
haven't really been using them pretty

80
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:03,159
well at least I am so I want to share a

81
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:07,199
little bit of what I've discovered and

82
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:09,639
another look at them in the last year or

83
00:04:09,639 --> 00:04:15,940
so adding a sticky as a it's one to one

84
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:18,970
standard that's extremely huge and

85
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:20,680
everyone sort of underestimates it I

86
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,090
think you can do a lot of things that

87
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:22,490
people

88
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:25,099
expect and I think going forward with

89
00:04:25,099 --> 00:04:26,539
sort of where the future from the

90
00:04:26,539 --> 00:04:29,210
development is heading you think of what

91
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:31,910
components anything goes in your icons

92
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:33,800
route 60 the modularization other

93
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,680
applications are going on your bill

94
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,849
think of the few thing you know the

95
00:04:37,849 --> 00:04:39,169
current awesome stuff that we have in

96
00:04:39,169 --> 00:04:42,849
css3 and versus a subtle for others

97
00:04:42,849 --> 00:04:46,300
wherever all that's going I think SVG is

98
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:48,949
ideally placed to take advantage of all

99
00:04:48,949 --> 00:04:52,509
of that and become a core part of our

100
00:04:52,509 --> 00:04:54,770
application architecture so we're going

101
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:56,569
to be quoting SVG just like we are

102
00:04:56,569 --> 00:04:58,880
putting CSS today which is something up

103
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,139
give me 10 years ago we wouldn't have

104
00:05:00,139 --> 00:05:03,050
thought that was more time to do because

105
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:04,550
we were doing everything indication on

106
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:07,130
JavaScript and then serve javis can win

107
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:09,349
and became totally crazy huge awesome

108
00:05:09,349 --> 00:05:11,150
but it's actually very simple language

109
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:12,979
compared to something like a CG which

110
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:16,310
supports a lot lot more it's kind of

111
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:18,530
like html5 together with the big swap I

112
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:20,380
suspect your schoolwork was really small

113
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:22,699
SPG something something like that except

114
00:05:22,699 --> 00:05:27,020
even more and I don't think we can cover

115
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:31,729
a nearly the entire standard today but I

116
00:05:31,729 --> 00:05:34,250
want to just introduce you and tell you

117
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:37,630
guys that that this is an amazing

118
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:40,039
technology that's available a lot of

119
00:05:40,039 --> 00:05:43,719
browsers and you think think about it

120
00:05:43,719 --> 00:05:47,389
it's not my intention to talk too much

121
00:05:47,389 --> 00:05:51,139
about the browser support because I

122
00:05:51,139 --> 00:05:53,030
think almost everything to look at it's

123
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:54,889
going to be broken in some browsers and

124
00:05:54,889 --> 00:05:57,560
that's kind of flying in a world right

125
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:00,650
here because we focus on the future the

126
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:02,419
but the lessons we learned here from all

127
00:06:02,419 --> 00:06:04,250
the amazing speakers today are things

128
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:06,319
that are going to matter to us for years

129
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:08,389
to come so I don't want to focus on

130
00:06:08,389 --> 00:06:11,120
legacy support I think most of the stuff

131
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,319
that even isn't working right now

132
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:14,569
rogersville options for it either

133
00:06:14,569 --> 00:06:17,270
already available or coming out soon to

134
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:19,009
sort of let us play with it and see

135
00:06:19,009 --> 00:06:23,569
where this is all head so I want to get

136
00:06:23,569 --> 00:06:27,349
away from this which to me is how I sort

137
00:06:27,349 --> 00:06:30,199
of wanted to present that Nia that this

138
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:33,380
Tiger is SVG as it was 10 or more years

139
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:35,180
ago I've seen this

140
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:39,199
picture again and again again and I want

141
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:43,009
to get away from this pointless use of

142
00:06:43,009 --> 00:06:45,169
SVG and to something like help us build

143
00:06:45,169 --> 00:06:48,370
applications and be cool like the

144
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:52,580
colonist so Who am I my name is

145
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:55,970
Sebastian I'm front-end developer i live

146
00:06:55,970 --> 00:06:57,289
in florida queer kind of comfortable

147
00:06:57,289 --> 00:06:59,840
co-founders a lot of startups and I'm

148
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,300
just basically good friend following all

149
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:04,520
the time we're not a number of projects

150
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:07,880
on board with all that so without

151
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:11,479
further ado let us talk about some of

152
00:07:11,479 --> 00:07:12,620
the community stuff that we have here as

153
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:15,590
well someone actually probably this

154
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:18,110
figure to take a lot of mess of people

155
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:20,030
here president right now this was a few

156
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:22,389
days ago there's a bit really vibrant

157
00:07:22,389 --> 00:07:24,530
community of front of developers in

158
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:26,389
Singapore and I just wanted a sort of

159
00:07:26,389 --> 00:07:30,169
share that I think it's amazing the way

160
00:07:30,169 --> 00:07:31,550
that developers have sort of gotten

161
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:35,270
together in Singapore across all hot for

162
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:37,820
all languages there's as you can see

163
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:39,530
with the fs there's something to be a

164
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:42,409
point here every single day there's

165
00:07:42,409 --> 00:07:44,180
something for everyone really it's just

166
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:46,250
every single year I've been here for

167
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:48,349
years every single you're pretty much

168
00:07:48,349 --> 00:07:49,520
doubles in science I think it's

169
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:52,190
wonderful and I look forward to all

170
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:59,120
future guess cops and super so if we can

171
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:03,590
look at scg coming from you know red CSS

172
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:05,449
com we're all trying to develop it

173
00:08:05,449 --> 00:08:08,750
almost it was a primary developers it's

174
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:12,380
actually very similar in what we used to

175
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:15,740
so I don't think you can see that so

176
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:17,449
basically it supports you know like

177
00:08:17,449 --> 00:08:20,690
device independent pixels animations

178
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:22,729
hardware acceleration you know very

179
00:08:22,729 --> 00:08:25,340
proud to support but some amazing

180
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:27,800
performance is possible blending modes

181
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,479
are really interesting there in my hat

182
00:08:29,479 --> 00:08:31,009
you might have used some lightning ones

183
00:08:31,009 --> 00:08:33,860
at CSS but they're kind of there it's

184
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:36,200
basically what lets us do photoshop kind

185
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:39,440
of effects with layers between HTML

186
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,829
elements or SVG elements you know you

187
00:08:42,829 --> 00:08:44,810
can make it responsive you can use your

188
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:46,329
luck inspector

189
00:08:46,329 --> 00:08:48,850
where there are tools to deploy the

190
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:52,839
things it's very very easy to do you've

191
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:55,600
got no filters it has a dog maybe I just

192
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,839
like you're really stew with the HTML so

193
00:08:58,839 --> 00:09:02,319
it makes it very powerful to build on

194
00:09:02,319 --> 00:09:05,259
top of it using logic to create elements

195
00:09:05,259 --> 00:09:08,439
to drive changes there's a lot of

196
00:09:08,439 --> 00:09:09,970
libraries that basically built on top of

197
00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:12,489
that make it very easy it's got

198
00:09:12,489 --> 00:09:14,079
scripting you'd embed it so not only can

199
00:09:14,079 --> 00:09:17,189
you access doing your SVG structures

200
00:09:17,189 --> 00:09:20,040
with scripts with external scripts and

201
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:24,129
manipulate the Dom the SPG's can

202
00:09:24,129 --> 00:09:26,079
actually that's between elements or

203
00:09:26,079 --> 00:09:28,839
documents also contain Java can also

204
00:09:28,839 --> 00:09:30,639
contain embed JavaScript just like an

205
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:36,100
HTML page or an HTML document would that

206
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:38,980
has certain security implications for

207
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:41,049
example would you allow javascript to

208
00:09:41,049 --> 00:09:43,720
run an SVG icon on your desktop no of

209
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,489
course not it's there's certain places

210
00:09:45,489 --> 00:09:46,660
where you can run it certain places

211
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:48,939
where you cannot as things like color

212
00:09:48,939 --> 00:09:50,410
profiles which you notes there's it's

213
00:09:50,410 --> 00:09:51,699
sort of a nice feature but like for

214
00:09:51,699 --> 00:09:54,329
people to print it's really important on

215
00:09:54,329 --> 00:09:56,619
the web it's sort of are probably going

216
00:09:56,619 --> 00:09:58,239
to become more important once we get to

217
00:09:58,239 --> 00:10:00,579
things like high dynamic range displays

218
00:10:00,579 --> 00:10:04,360
in the coming years now how do you use

219
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:06,429
SVG's well I think a lot of you have

220
00:10:06,429 --> 00:10:09,249
probably seen some of the common usage

221
00:10:09,249 --> 00:10:11,589
patterns just you know replacing a ping

222
00:10:11,589 --> 00:10:14,079
file with a good an SPG things like that

223
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:16,089
so let me run through some of the main

224
00:10:16,089 --> 00:10:17,829
and is it visit not all of them there's

225
00:10:17,829 --> 00:10:21,369
actually an incredible variety of ways

226
00:10:21,369 --> 00:10:23,049
to use SVG so I'm going to run through

227
00:10:23,049 --> 00:10:26,619
some of the main ones one of my favorite

228
00:10:26,619 --> 00:10:30,160
ones is the html5 you know native

229
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:33,249
support for the SVG element you don't

230
00:10:33,249 --> 00:10:34,929
have to do anything for it just open an

231
00:10:34,929 --> 00:10:37,569
element SVG and you can drop any kind of

232
00:10:37,569 --> 00:10:40,569
SVG elements within that any kind of

233
00:10:40,569 --> 00:10:43,569
shapes I can get really complicated of

234
00:10:43,569 --> 00:10:45,339
course but do simple things with that in

235
00:10:45,339 --> 00:10:47,949
your daily development if you need to

236
00:10:47,949 --> 00:10:49,360
draw a line between something you don't

237
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,639
have through hacks with Porter borders

238
00:10:51,639 --> 00:10:53,559
and all that kind of stuff you can just

239
00:10:53,559 --> 00:10:55,990
draw a line and that's big deal it takes

240
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:58,869
very little code to do that you no

241
00:10:58,869 --> 00:10:59,710
longer have to worry about

242
00:10:59,710 --> 00:11:01,060
namespaces and all these kind of things

243
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:03,940
and you know it renders beautifully it's

244
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:06,640
high performance it's cleaner code you

245
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,380
can read the code and it means that

246
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:09,700
there's an actual line there is no

247
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:12,490
longer like somehow a div with a border

248
00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:14,530
bottom somewhere else define in CSS file

249
00:11:14,530 --> 00:11:17,440
it's very clean it works really well in

250
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,900
large-scale applications and I've really

251
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:24,160
been using that a lot lately so another

252
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,320
way to do it that probably more people

253
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:29,140
are familiar with right now is uh just

254
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:32,070
loading in a URL function in CSS and

255
00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:34,600
these can be used in a lot of places

256
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:37,990
like background images obviously this

257
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:39,220
style in which is those little those

258
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:42,040
little glyphs in front of the you know I

259
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,750
could've ordered lists out of us for an

260
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:46,330
unordered list things like the border

261
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:50,050
image that's a something that you can do

262
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:52,620
some neat tricks with it's not the most

263
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:55,600
high-performance most browsers but it

264
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:59,170
works Purser's sort of flaky support

265
00:11:59,170 --> 00:12:00,730
right now but again not really concerned

266
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:04,020
with that and content you know like for

267
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:06,430
your sooo elements like your before and

268
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:09,040
after you can draw images within them

269
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:14,290
which is kind of it SVG fonts probably

270
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:15,520
most of you have heard of them or seen

271
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:17,950
them whenever you copy paste that you

272
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:21,730
know that some custom font from like

273
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:23,110
font awesome or whatever service that

274
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:25,600
you use as many fonts are sort of

275
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:31,720
deprecated but it looks like and this is

276
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,910
just looking on mailing lists and

277
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:37,110
discussions there's a lot of interest in

278
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:41,890
multicolor fonts I thought it was a bit

279
00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:43,300
weird at first which I which we call the

280
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:45,360
court once but then you know emoji

281
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,560
everybody loves sending emoji emoticons

282
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:50,050
and those have readings those have

283
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:52,920
shadows there's a lot of colors and

284
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:55,750
there's competing standards right now so

285
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:58,980
SVG's possibly making a comeback in

286
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:01,660
fonts there's a lot of support in next

287
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:03,700
15 spot elements dedicated to you know

288
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:06,820
fonts and like structuring upon in SVG

289
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:08,950
and most of those are right now sort of

290
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:11,320
like brushed aside but they might come

291
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:11,860
back and

292
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:12,910
when they do we'll have things like

293
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:14,800
colorful fonts we'll have the fonts

294
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,260
gradients within a single glyphs will

295
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:19,870
have shadows without you know it will be

296
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:23,560
beautiful scalable moved the world will

297
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:27,579
be possible so that's sort of something

298
00:13:27,579 --> 00:13:29,350
that right now I you know probably

299
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:31,810
shouldn't be using but in a couple of

300
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:35,529
years who knows another way to use them

301
00:13:35,529 --> 00:13:37,810
right now which is it's actually really

302
00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:41,800
cool it's a better way to do sprites so

303
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,720
if you're doing if you're combining a

304
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:46,839
lot of small images into a larger image

305
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:49,540
then you know it you have to set up

306
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:51,220
another book build stab all these kind

307
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:53,320
of stuff and you have to deal with

308
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:55,120
change in core minutes and stuff and

309
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,829
things like that it gets a little bit

310
00:13:56,829 --> 00:13:59,800
unwieldy sometimes it's it's a really

311
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,540
really nice way to do it is to just

312
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:04,510
stack all of them in a single SVG and

313
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:06,910
you can also you can again use a bill a

314
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:08,110
bill stepp for that but it but i'm

315
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:09,339
really used to actually manage that

316
00:14:09,339 --> 00:14:12,130
within your your your SVG editors like

317
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:18,640
illustrator or inkscape and the way to

318
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:22,390
reference them is by just using a URL

319
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:24,730
like like like these two here the first

320
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:27,519
one is how you actually reference SVG

321
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:31,060
fragments inside your SVG files so if

322
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:34,390
you're embedding in line SPG in your

323
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:37,570
document you can use the use element

324
00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:40,209
with a this x-linked hrh reference it's

325
00:14:40,209 --> 00:14:42,970
not the produce language words you can

326
00:14:42,970 --> 00:14:44,820
reference your file and then do a

327
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:49,000
fragment identifier in the URL and that

328
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,339
will pull up the ID like the element

329
00:14:51,339 --> 00:14:53,500
with the ID that you specify like

330
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,829
in this case it will pull up the fox

331
00:14:55,829 --> 00:14:58,750
element and render only that it won't

332
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:02,339
render anything else so you can have 100

333
00:15:02,339 --> 00:15:04,480
icons in there and it will just pick up

334
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:08,470
that single that's single I element it's

335
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:11,589
a really nice way to do sort of icon

336
00:15:11,589 --> 00:15:13,449
sheets for icon stacks or whatever II

337
00:15:13,449 --> 00:15:17,649
call them it also works and image source

338
00:15:17,649 --> 00:15:20,380
in your regular HTML so in this case i

339
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:22,000
would pick the same file but pick a

340
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,589
different element and i would not see

341
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:24,690
the box and

342
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:28,230
rather than the other one I think it

343
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:30,690
also works in the background image sorry

344
00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:34,350
I didn't check that right now so let's

345
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:36,540
let's have a quick look em I'm sure you

346
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:38,400
know probably some of you have already

347
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:41,070
seen you know what SVG looks like what I

348
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:42,840
can do with it the basic level so i'll

349
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:45,180
just quickly skip through this so the

350
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:47,180
basic building blocks of ice cream are

351
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:49,380
really you know i could CSS you have

352
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:50,850
your units they're actually exactly the

353
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:54,210
same in fact SVG specification says you

354
00:15:54,210 --> 00:15:55,680
know our units are basically the same

355
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,780
ones as define its users 2.1 the old

356
00:15:57,780 --> 00:15:59,520
stuff so but it hasn't really changed

357
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:01,950
that much good three anyway and i'm

358
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:04,950
talking about cious SVG 1.1 which is

359
00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:06,570
pretty old but it's it's sort of what

360
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:12,230
everyone uses today the basic shapes are

361
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:14,880
sort of simple ways to define common

362
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,740
geometric shapes so if you want to do a

363
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:18,780
rectangle you can make it any size you

364
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:22,230
want you can give a round of it like a

365
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:24,720
little bordering this sort of thing it's

366
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,130
not as powerful as like for example

367
00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:28,460
aboard reuse its CSS where you can do

368
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:31,740
crazy things with like order reporters

369
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:33,240
that sort of have different slopes on

370
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:35,190
the vertical horizontal ones on every

371
00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:37,830
corner to be different it's very limited

372
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:40,800
in an SVG but most of the times you just

373
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,690
want to do a simple shape in any way you

374
00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:44,490
can do that the complex ones you can

375
00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:46,200
also do but it requires a little bit

376
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,960
more manual work usually you want to do

377
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:51,980
that with the X icon like a visitor

378
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:53,790
anyway so there's other shapes of

379
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:56,730
ellipses and circles new lines and

380
00:16:56,730 --> 00:16:58,440
polylines are like that little that

381
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,930
little lightning you can just put

382
00:17:00,930 --> 00:17:03,990
coordinates it's pretty easy to do this

383
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:06,810
manually you don't need an editor it's

384
00:17:06,810 --> 00:17:08,310
you know it's relatively straightforward

385
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:10,290
I won't go through all the syntax you

386
00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:12,350
can just look it up in a reference

387
00:17:12,350 --> 00:17:15,750
polygons etc the last one is more like a

388
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:19,170
like a path actually so Pat's it's not

389
00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:20,550
that important right now but the past

390
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:22,380
you can do things like lines arcs busier

391
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:24,329
curves however you pronounce that

392
00:17:24,329 --> 00:17:27,120
quadratic curves basically in cute

393
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:30,880
little geometric shapes they are vain

394
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,460
to do manually I'll tell you so it uses

395
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:36,010
a weird text based drawing instructions

396
00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:37,720
thing where your move to a point and you

397
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:38,920
draw at another point and you have

398
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,990
control points and it's impossible to do

399
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:43,330
these things in your head so basically

400
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:45,520
copy paste from like sketch illustrator

401
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:48,970
an excuse for them so that's that's the

402
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:52,030
basic fundamental of drawing shapes and

403
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:55,390
stuff if you wanna reference bitmap

404
00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:59,470
images or other SVG's there's an image

405
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:01,600
element which is not IMG but it which

406
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,270
the forward again with that X link href

407
00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:08,500
and you know it supports any file format

408
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:11,440
that that your your browser would

409
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:14,470
otherwise render we've also base64

410
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:16,870
encode them in a URL so this is again

411
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:19,030
stuff that were all used to and it makes

412
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:20,980
it very very convenient to nest other

413
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:23,020
images in your image and reference them

414
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:25,900
we use them leverage at all caching that

415
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:28,620
we have with HTTP it's a nice way to

416
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:31,630
basically have documents that reference

417
00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:32,620
outer document which is something that

418
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:35,080
you can't really do with any other image

419
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:40,120
format like like paint or JPEG it's a it

420
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,800
can be a really powerful feature man

421
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:45,220
when used appropriately there's a lot of

422
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:47,110
other stuff which you know I don't have

423
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:49,510
nearly enough time to cover right now

424
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:52,240
you could probably do entire hour long

425
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,740
talk about each of these things it's

426
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:56,020
there they're amazingly powerful you

427
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:57,400
know you can move all kinda velopment

428
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,630
and treat them as long and into

429
00:18:58,630 --> 00:19:00,250
transformations on top of them it's

430
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:03,180
really cool patterns again

431
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:05,320
transformations right we're not going to

432
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:06,580
get into all of that so let's just go

433
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:10,540
ahead the SPG gone okay it's something

434
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:13,330
where I'm really excited because we're

435
00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:15,310
at CSS conflict but there's also GS com

436
00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:18,820
tomorrow and the DOM is really how you

437
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:22,560
make things interactive in HTML and

438
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:25,270
almost the exact same methods apply to

439
00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:28,650
SVG so if you're building an application

440
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:31,270
in HTML you might as well just do it in

441
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:33,280
SVG and say you know we've got all these

442
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,540
beautiful shapes and lines and

443
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:36,010
connecting things a lot of times you're

444
00:19:36,010 --> 00:19:38,920
doing data visualization don't bother

445
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:41,320
with HTML and trying to mock things up

446
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:43,060
with fake elements all over the place

447
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:43,770
and containers

448
00:19:43,770 --> 00:19:46,040
right just do this video straight away

449
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:48,060
javascript makes it really easy to deal

450
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:50,610
with you do have to worry about

451
00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:57,330
namespaces because XML you know too

452
00:19:57,330 --> 00:20:02,730
biased against XML I think it's actually

453
00:20:02,730 --> 00:20:05,340
not too big of a deal one you can easily

454
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:07,650
work around it right a couple of helper

455
00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:09,600
functions that deal with this because

456
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,570
basically it's the same code so you

457
00:20:12,570 --> 00:20:15,560
create element set attribute get element

458
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:17,850
except you have to specify a namespace

459
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:19,680
which is just a little string day at

460
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:22,710
this net supply it it can sometimes make

461
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:23,880
it a little bit tricky like you know

462
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,500
what why is this element not showing up

463
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:26,550
it's because my browser doesn't

464
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:28,560
recognize it it thinks it's nation LOL

465
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,660
and after you should be SVG element it

466
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:32,100
gets a little bit weird sometimes but

467
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:36,060
just keep it in mind to help you with

468
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:39,180
that stuff you can also use a number of

469
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:40,860
libraries here are some of the common

470
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:45,300
ones there's a there's a queue that's a

471
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:47,010
green sock is really cool I've been

472
00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:50,150
using it for some pretty heavy front-end

473
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:53,310
animated animated stuff there I'm deal

474
00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:55,950
with campuses that are hundreds of

475
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:58,530
thousands of pixels squared and the

476
00:20:58,530 --> 00:21:00,810
performance of this stuff is amazing you

477
00:21:00,810 --> 00:21:02,700
want to use your probably want to use

478
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:05,910
one of these rappers because things like

479
00:21:05,910 --> 00:21:09,330
transformations in SVG are a pain when

480
00:21:09,330 --> 00:21:11,630
you when you when you're coming from CSS

481
00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:14,220
simply because the things like things

482
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:16,170
like the the transform origin are a

483
00:21:16,170 --> 00:21:17,820
little bit different they're not in the

484
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:21,900
senator in a corner and it just can get

485
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:24,900
really confusing and these these use API

486
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:26,730
is a sort of like pave over all of that

487
00:21:26,730 --> 00:21:29,490
consistency as well as help you with

488
00:21:29,490 --> 00:21:30,900
some of the the shortcomings that

489
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:33,240
browsers still have today so you know I

490
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:36,420
able to have a look at these as Rafael

491
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:40,020
there's synaptics Fiji there's SVG SMG

492
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:44,970
sap the green some animation so like I

493
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:46,590
said earlier you know the doucher of the

494
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:47,910
web's is probably going to be web

495
00:21:47,910 --> 00:21:50,130
components right but I don't know how

496
00:21:50,130 --> 00:21:51,570
many of you have already been playing

497
00:21:51,570 --> 00:21:55,680
with this I I find amazing

498
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:56,970
that these things are now in the browser

499
00:21:56,970 --> 00:21:58,980
and if you look at things like Oliver if

500
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:02,130
you look at X tag they just work it's

501
00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:05,610
amazing you don't really get a lot more

502
00:22:05,610 --> 00:22:06,900
flexibility in how you structure your

503
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:08,910
application which I'll just to reuse a

504
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:10,890
lot more code which allows us to build

505
00:22:10,890 --> 00:22:13,530
more advanced software in less time or

506
00:22:13,530 --> 00:22:17,040
at same time and what your point can now

507
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:19,440
do is create your own elements in HTML

508
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,930
you can do the same thing in SVG and the

509
00:22:21,930 --> 00:22:25,770
way it works is not really right now

510
00:22:25,770 --> 00:22:27,270
we're working with things like polymer

511
00:22:27,270 --> 00:22:30,450
but if you if you do if you coat it with

512
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:34,290
a standard epi yourself this actually

513
00:22:34,290 --> 00:22:37,410
works in the browser test this out and

514
00:22:37,410 --> 00:22:39,240
then you can extend the behavior of

515
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:41,910
elements basically making your view just

516
00:22:41,910 --> 00:22:44,910
an element that you can invoke anywhere

517
00:22:44,910 --> 00:22:47,310
you want any application so for example

518
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:48,690
what I'm creating here wouldn't register

519
00:22:48,690 --> 00:22:51,090
his helmet here I could then instantiate

520
00:22:51,090 --> 00:22:53,400
that I could assign I could I could I

521
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:56,010
could attach custom behavior to it you

522
00:22:56,010 --> 00:22:58,380
would inherit from in this case SVG

523
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:00,780
circle I could make that an interactive

524
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:02,790
circle I could attach automatically

525
00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:06,470
eject all the event handlers that

526
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:11,940
monitor touch input eielson foot and you

527
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:13,950
know it sort of lets you neatly wrap a

528
00:23:13,950 --> 00:23:16,080
lot of your functionality so again this

529
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,460
is not about web components but I think

530
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:18,600
that it's amazing that we can do this

531
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:21,240
across HTML as well as SVG and again

532
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:25,200
shows the the power that s what she has

533
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,990
in joining our stack as front of

534
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:33,480
developers and roller so not just HTML

535
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:35,520
works for this routine we can also do

536
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:39,750
the same with CSS it's it's what you use

537
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:42,930
to basically give a markup and there's

538
00:23:42,930 --> 00:23:45,360
there's a lot of different ways to do

539
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:50,430
that with CSS in SVG so here's some of

540
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:51,480
the common ones there's a lot of other

541
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:54,120
ways as well but sort of the the main

542
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,890
ways of doing it especially when you're

543
00:23:55,890 --> 00:23:58,320
doing in line SVG in your document which

544
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:02,010
is why it's so preferred is to actually

545
00:24:02,010 --> 00:24:04,620
have your CSS referenced like you would

546
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:06,420
normally have it in your HTML page in

547
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:07,540
HTML document

548
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:12,860
and it can actually set selectors here

549
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:16,880
your CSS that target things inside the

550
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:20,059
SVG document because it's embedded it

551
00:24:20,059 --> 00:24:22,429
becomes you know very straightforward

552
00:24:22,429 --> 00:24:23,950
for everyone I'm team to understand

553
00:24:23,950 --> 00:24:26,179
could become you use the same

554
00:24:26,179 --> 00:24:28,220
modularization approach that you that

555
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:29,360
you would for the other of using

556
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:31,640
application and now applies to SVG

557
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:36,140
elements it's very seamless in councils

558
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:39,500
good you know things like inline CSS on

559
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:41,440
your SVG elements directly but again

560
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,850
just like we don't do that with a

561
00:24:43,850 --> 00:24:45,559
squeegee these people hope we don't do

562
00:24:45,559 --> 00:24:48,590
that those are good HTML and you again

563
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:50,240
probably shouldn't be doing a whole lot

564
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:54,230
of CSS in line and it's between you just

565
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:56,480
like we would be nice to know there's a

566
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,280
as you might see here there's a there's

567
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:00,920
some new property using SVG what's

568
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:03,530
different properties in SVG there's also

569
00:25:03,530 --> 00:25:04,760
certain properties that don't really

570
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:06,020
work I'm not going to go through an

571
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:08,240
entire list there's plenty of resources

572
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:11,929
available online basically whenever you

573
00:25:11,929 --> 00:25:14,210
draw a line or a shape you use things

574
00:25:14,210 --> 00:25:15,710
like stroke you settle with on that

575
00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:18,290
scope you can fill that shape these are

576
00:25:18,290 --> 00:25:19,490
very straightforward concepts you can

577
00:25:19,490 --> 00:25:21,320
move things for like more advanced with

578
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:23,330
patterns that you just slug the whole

579
00:25:23,330 --> 00:25:25,700
thing we deliver the texture with some

580
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:30,440
kind of utter utter designs these are

581
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:32,559
things that aren't really there and CSS

582
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:36,860
they make they make a lot more a lot of

583
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:38,150
designs with it something become

584
00:25:38,150 --> 00:25:40,880
possible and that like easy that would

585
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:43,160
otherwise be really hard to pull off and

586
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:49,309
playing CSS and HTML so yeah there's

587
00:25:49,309 --> 00:25:51,260
other ways like I can pull in external

588
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:53,030
track style sheets directly into your

589
00:25:53,030 --> 00:25:54,590
ass with you which is kind of convenient

590
00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:58,190
when you have a standalone SVG file what

591
00:25:58,190 --> 00:26:01,750
you can do is use at the xml style sheet

592
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:04,309
instruction to actually load a CEO that

593
00:26:04,309 --> 00:26:06,290
smile it's slightly different from what

594
00:26:06,290 --> 00:26:08,420
you would what you would do with a link

595
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:10,480
tag in HTML but it works just the same

596
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:13,400
again allows you to separate all your

597
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:16,309
design from your instructor allows you

598
00:26:16,309 --> 00:26:19,580
to leverage caching again as well so all

599
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:22,660
benefits that were used to exist in SVG

600
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:25,490
and I'll run through every couple of a

601
00:26:25,490 --> 00:26:27,440
couple of things that i came across and

602
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:29,870
we're surprising to me in my experience

603
00:26:29,870 --> 00:26:34,160
using SVG in my web applications there's

604
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:36,890
there's things that are really strange

605
00:26:36,890 --> 00:26:40,850
at first for example the view box this

606
00:26:40,850 --> 00:26:42,230
is one this is one of those things that

607
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:44,180
you sort of have to you know you have

608
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:46,640
the crockett before SVG starts to make

609
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,610
sense before you can actually think SVG

610
00:26:48,610 --> 00:26:51,110
the few bucks is an attribute on the SVG

611
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:53,840
element where you did turn that great

612
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:57,020
you can specify which part of the you

613
00:26:57,020 --> 00:26:59,960
know that sort of SVG canvas will show

614
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:03,400
up when you embed that SVG in your

615
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:06,860
content it's it's kind of interesting to

616
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:08,450
think about that you could actually do a

617
00:27:08,450 --> 00:27:13,040
crop and a transform essentially if you

618
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:17,630
look at the screenshot the measuring the

619
00:27:17,630 --> 00:27:21,340
groove the rulers their show the entire

620
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:23,690
document that squeegee document

621
00:27:23,690 --> 00:27:25,130
basically all the campus as well as

622
00:27:25,130 --> 00:27:29,870
locally and the orange box is what gets

623
00:27:29,870 --> 00:27:34,250
shown where this SVG will be embedded so

624
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:36,230
the like for example the eyes and most

625
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:38,810
of the beak of this bird would not

626
00:27:38,810 --> 00:27:42,950
appear when this which is embedded but

627
00:27:42,950 --> 00:27:46,010
you can easily change which part gets

628
00:27:46,010 --> 00:27:48,290
shown the other thing about the view box

629
00:27:48,290 --> 00:27:52,060
is that you can stretch and scale

630
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:54,290
without having to touch all the

631
00:27:54,290 --> 00:27:58,400
coordinates in your your geometric

632
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:02,270
shapes in this case if you look at the

633
00:28:02,270 --> 00:28:04,160
view box attribute by the way its case

634
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,570
sensitive it's kind of painful because

635
00:28:05,570 --> 00:28:07,460
jquery doesn't really like that very

636
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:10,940
much a lot about our tools also have

637
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:12,410
issues with that with case sensitive

638
00:28:12,410 --> 00:28:16,220
attributes but so you have 100 100 200

639
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:19,400
150 now 100 100 is your translation

640
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:21,590
which means that if you have enough like

641
00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:23,560
if you have a use case where you want to

642
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:28,730
pan across an SVG an image you can use

643
00:28:28,730 --> 00:28:31,320
those first two values

644
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:34,140
to move the view box over your image

645
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:35,520
without touching any of the image

646
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,230
elements and all any of the children's

647
00:28:37,230 --> 00:28:40,200
coordinates is one of those things where

648
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,910
I feel like that didn't really belong a

649
00:28:41,910 --> 00:28:43,710
few bucks but they put it there anyway

650
00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:47,400
and it's there now and you know you

651
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,200
usually just leave them at zero zero and

652
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,270
to deal with the view box that starts at

653
00:28:51,270 --> 00:28:53,640
the origin point where it belongs

654
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:58,650
essentially the 200 150 obviously is a

655
00:28:58,650 --> 00:29:01,530
the size of the view box but the tricky

656
00:29:01,530 --> 00:29:06,410
bit about that is that size is sort of

657
00:29:06,410 --> 00:29:08,370
it's a little it's a little bit more

658
00:29:08,370 --> 00:29:09,810
complicated but basically there's no

659
00:29:09,810 --> 00:29:12,630
units on it and what that means is that

660
00:29:12,630 --> 00:29:14,790
you can specify you know you're not the

661
00:29:14,790 --> 00:29:17,280
work because it's a pixel is this a.m is

662
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:22,110
this a point is it up pick up you can

663
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:24,330
use you don't have to worry about limits

664
00:29:24,330 --> 00:29:26,070
they're all called user units

665
00:29:26,070 --> 00:29:28,200
essentially in the user coordinate

666
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:31,260
system and all kind of stuff they get

667
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:33,210
scaled to whatever you set as the width

668
00:29:33,210 --> 00:29:35,490
or height now the width or height are

669
00:29:35,490 --> 00:29:37,560
optional so what that means is you can

670
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:40,190
create your L your your SVG content

671
00:29:40,190 --> 00:29:43,350
independent of where it's going to show

672
00:29:43,350 --> 00:29:45,330
how large it's going to be but you can

673
00:29:45,330 --> 00:29:47,010
still use the simplicity of calculating

674
00:29:47,010 --> 00:29:49,950
as sort of a virtual pixels so you can

675
00:29:49,950 --> 00:29:53,070
specify content that's you know 175 and

676
00:29:53,070 --> 00:29:57,570
25 and just you just look at a 200 as

677
00:29:57,570 --> 00:29:59,610
your total size and that will scale

678
00:29:59,610 --> 00:30:01,350
perfectly wherever that's being used

679
00:30:01,350 --> 00:30:03,060
wherever that's which you will end up

680
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:05,220
being embedded and as you change the

681
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:07,440
size of the width and the height for

682
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:08,580
example if I were to change that to

683
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:11,490
percents one hundred percent with it

684
00:30:11,490 --> 00:30:13,170
would scale perfectly is very easy to

685
00:30:13,170 --> 00:30:15,150
make responsive and it scales perfectly

686
00:30:15,150 --> 00:30:17,100
something really hard to do with HTML

687
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:20,220
you know I imagine if you had to scale

688
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:22,440
an HTML element and all the children

689
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:24,720
automatically you just I think later on

690
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:25,920
in the day there'll be some talks about

691
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:29,120
that but uh things like flexbox but uh

692
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,500
but that's what G it's extremely easy to

693
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:37,830
do this so one issue with that it's what

694
00:30:37,830 --> 00:30:41,070
happens when you scale them but the

695
00:30:41,070 --> 00:30:43,080
aspect ratio is different from that of

696
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:45,200
the few bucks

697
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:48,380
you get sort of a funhouse mirror effect

698
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:50,529
that's what i was going for you

699
00:30:50,529 --> 00:30:52,250
essentially there's there's another

700
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:54,649
attribute SVG called preserve aspect

701
00:30:54,649 --> 00:30:59,929
ratio may nicknames it's it's got a ring

702
00:30:59,929 --> 00:31:02,840
weird syntax but i don't haven't seen

703
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:09,620
any uh it's similar to that and CSS but

704
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:11,480
it sort of works like your background

705
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:16,250
size property in CSS not as powerful but

706
00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:18,980
can be used to do similar things where

707
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:22,159
background size can do you know

708
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:24,950
stretching a background image to contain

709
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:28,370
or to cover and it will crop the image

710
00:31:28,370 --> 00:31:33,080
or a little letter box the the

711
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:34,490
background image basically in element

712
00:31:34,490 --> 00:31:36,350
it's sort of the same way where if you

713
00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:40,340
if you embed an SVG element inside let's

714
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:44,149
say an HTML block and your HTML blocks

715
00:31:44,149 --> 00:31:47,779
fetches really wide you can then use

716
00:31:47,779 --> 00:31:49,519
preserve aspect ratio to detect to

717
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:51,620
determine how it gets stretched or if

718
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:53,090
it's squeezed or what happens to it

719
00:31:53,090 --> 00:31:55,070
there's a you know there's a little

720
00:31:55,070 --> 00:31:56,960
image here just include as you can find

721
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:00,409
us online it's a really you know it's

722
00:32:00,409 --> 00:32:02,000
one of those things once you get it it

723
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,590
just makes sense and it's one of those

724
00:32:03,590 --> 00:32:04,929
things well when you're dealing with

725
00:32:04,929 --> 00:32:08,860
responsive SVG i always reference this

726
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:11,990
move is the this horrible image because

727
00:32:11,990 --> 00:32:14,139
just explains it every single time

728
00:32:14,139 --> 00:32:17,149
things like cover and contain become an

729
00:32:17,149 --> 00:32:21,399
SPG become meet slice things like

730
00:32:21,399 --> 00:32:24,200
aligning to a good background position

731
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,970
where you stick stick elements to the

732
00:32:25,970 --> 00:32:27,139
left to the right to the top to the

733
00:32:27,139 --> 00:32:32,899
bottom or in the center is somehow x is

734
00:32:32,899 --> 00:32:34,460
lower case and why is uppercase I don't

735
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:37,639
know is it it just makes it up it

736
00:32:37,639 --> 00:32:39,620
doesn't make a lot of sense and it also

737
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:40,970
doesn't have you to do things like you

738
00:32:40,970 --> 00:32:44,960
come like you're used to in CSS where to

739
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:47,929
go to do it to one side and offset it by

740
00:32:47,929 --> 00:32:49,580
a certain percentage or a number of

741
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:51,169
pixels you can do slightly thing

742
00:32:51,169 --> 00:32:53,629
slightly more powerful things in CSS but

743
00:32:53,629 --> 00:32:55,460
this sort of works

744
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:58,010
in a lot of cases and gets job that he

745
00:32:58,010 --> 00:33:02,460
owes work around us the problems anyway

746
00:33:02,470 --> 00:33:05,000
one more thing that you should probably

747
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:09,169
aware of it unlike HTML you know the

748
00:33:09,169 --> 00:33:12,860
limit to how big your skin your SVG can

749
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:16,340
rent on the screen so in HTML with CSS

750
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:18,230
you can you can have you can set up you

751
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:20,690
know an image that has a million billion

752
00:33:20,690 --> 00:33:23,510
pixels you know squared or whatever in

753
00:33:23,510 --> 00:33:25,370
that minutes and it's fine the browser

754
00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:26,720
doesn't really care too much about that

755
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:29,770
I'll is still thing and life goes on

756
00:33:29,770 --> 00:33:33,830
with SVG you know of SPG things crash

757
00:33:33,830 --> 00:33:37,520
that's do you can crash iOS things run

758
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:41,000
out of texture every on on the GPU the

759
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,590
drivers are buggy for those those kind

760
00:33:42,590 --> 00:33:45,740
of things and you end up in a really bad

761
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:47,960
situation really quickly it's sort of

762
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,460
similar to what happens when you have

763
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:52,520
extremely large JPEGs and files other

764
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:56,480
app images the what happens is that they

765
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,980
don't get tiled as much as they get

766
00:33:57,980 --> 00:33:59,750
rendered into a texture the tribute to

767
00:33:59,750 --> 00:34:02,240
make things faster the whole thing gets

768
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,929
rasterized uploaded into the GPU and

769
00:34:04,929 --> 00:34:08,300
then things have yeah get limited very

770
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:12,320
quickly what you need to do really is i

771
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:14,240
think use that what I've done anyway is

772
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:15,919
use that view box trick where you do a

773
00:34:15,919 --> 00:34:20,030
transform you basically restrain the

774
00:34:20,030 --> 00:34:22,460
size of the view box and use transform

775
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:24,770
to sort of pan around if you really want

776
00:34:24,770 --> 00:34:26,450
to show it at exhuming you can connect

777
00:34:26,450 --> 00:34:28,849
it to a a little bit of JavaScript

778
00:34:28,849 --> 00:34:30,440
you're connected to your scrolling in

779
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:32,330
your panning and as you're as you're

780
00:34:32,330 --> 00:34:34,129
moving around just update the view box

781
00:34:34,129 --> 00:34:37,609
and things render things update really

782
00:34:37,609 --> 00:34:38,839
quickly lotus which you could sell

783
00:34:38,839 --> 00:34:42,260
harder x over it anyway you get like

784
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:43,490
let's say here you get infinite

785
00:34:43,490 --> 00:34:45,500
resolution which basically means using

786
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:47,210
that same view box trick you could

787
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:48,589
specify a beaut review bucks that's

788
00:34:48,589 --> 00:34:50,510
unreeling pixels wide and it could scale

789
00:34:50,510 --> 00:34:53,300
down to how to fixify without the pixels

790
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:55,070
or something you get extreme precision

791
00:34:55,070 --> 00:34:56,869
but it doesn't really make a difference

792
00:34:56,869 --> 00:35:01,520
in terms of the limit on how many fixes

793
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:03,080
you can render to that's basically

794
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:05,420
limited by the operating system by your

795
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:06,950
graphics drivers and berries from device

796
00:35:06,950 --> 00:35:08,070
to device

797
00:35:08,070 --> 00:35:11,100
varies from browser to browser it's a

798
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:12,930
big picking a little tricky I recommend

799
00:35:12,930 --> 00:35:15,090
keeping it under 5 megapixels and that

800
00:35:15,090 --> 00:35:17,370
means if you have one pixel height you

801
00:35:17,370 --> 00:35:21,480
can do 5 55 million pixels wide keep it

802
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:23,370
something like the size of this the size

803
00:35:23,370 --> 00:35:25,320
of the screen is typically are good idea

804
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:28,620
don't go beyond that so if you don't

805
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:34,450
know me on like a 4k I left that way i

806
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:36,420
wanted to mention a couple of small

807
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:39,600
things about optimizing it's a Fugees

808
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:41,880
because they're written like you write

809
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:45,600
HTML yeah things like comments because

810
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:50,070
of the way tools output SPG's when

811
00:35:50,070 --> 00:35:52,680
you're editing them it might turn out if

812
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:57,270
you very very verbose code or XML and

813
00:35:57,270 --> 00:35:58,920
there's there's a tool called s you go

814
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:02,280
let's video I pronounce that it's got

815
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:04,770
easy way to integrate it with your grunt

816
00:36:04,770 --> 00:36:07,830
and your gulp stack and it's sort of you

817
00:36:07,830 --> 00:36:10,020
know compresses it a little bit most of

818
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:11,070
the compression are you getting it on

819
00:36:11,070 --> 00:36:14,390
svgs is going to be from gzip over HTTP

820
00:36:14,390 --> 00:36:17,220
its is still going to be plain text

821
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:20,130
right but it sort of makes it a little

822
00:36:20,130 --> 00:36:23,310
bit better you'd be surprised how how

823
00:36:23,310 --> 00:36:26,130
bad some of the tools are at outputting

824
00:36:26,130 --> 00:36:28,380
really really verbose for comments that

825
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:31,230
are totally useless things like paths it

826
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:32,340
will string them together into a single

827
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:34,230
path instead of having like many

828
00:36:34,230 --> 00:36:36,060
sections as your designer is drawing

829
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:39,210
them so let's jump too much is really

830
00:36:39,210 --> 00:36:41,310
nice to use with that it's all automated

831
00:36:41,310 --> 00:36:44,730
of course and you know that I think that

832
00:36:44,730 --> 00:36:45,930
about covers it but there's a couple of

833
00:36:45,930 --> 00:36:49,350
more things I wanted to hear animation I

834
00:36:49,350 --> 00:36:51,810
haven't really touched on now with

835
00:36:51,810 --> 00:36:54,510
animation you can do it in a variety of

836
00:36:54,510 --> 00:36:56,580
ways so obviously you can use CSS

837
00:36:56,580 --> 00:36:58,710
animations if you've already covered CSS

838
00:36:58,710 --> 00:37:02,040
SPG certain properties cannot be

839
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:04,500
animated right now whereas it could be

840
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:09,180
in HTML so instead it might make more

841
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:11,040
sense to use JavaScript something like

842
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:14,280
those those those are the wrappers of

843
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:15,530
the API rappers that I mentioned earlier

844
00:37:15,530 --> 00:37:18,150
things like jisa I've been using it it's

845
00:37:18,150 --> 00:37:19,800
really high performance it makes it very

846
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:20,859
easy into code

847
00:37:20,859 --> 00:37:22,569
exactly the same as you're used to in

848
00:37:22,569 --> 00:37:27,279
HTML you can bend you can also use smell

849
00:37:27,279 --> 00:37:31,900
or sm IL it's actually recommended way

850
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:35,619
of moving animations in in SVG it looks

851
00:37:35,619 --> 00:37:38,710
really nice when you quoted it's

852
00:37:38,710 --> 00:37:39,999
basically just another attack is the

853
00:37:39,999 --> 00:37:43,059
anime to tag I'm not going to go into

854
00:37:43,059 --> 00:37:45,279
detail here again it's a whole top of a

855
00:37:45,279 --> 00:37:49,539
topic of its own but it gets really good

856
00:37:49,539 --> 00:37:51,599
performance it's the way forward and

857
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:55,420
speaking of the way forward we're going

858
00:37:55,420 --> 00:37:58,299
to have SVG to presume that shows that

859
00:37:58,299 --> 00:38:01,180
there's a similar to that show that

860
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:02,710
there's a lot of promise a lot of

861
00:38:02,710 --> 00:38:05,019
investment happening in to SVG because I

862
00:38:05,019 --> 00:38:06,700
think people recognize that it is part

863
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:08,160
of the future of front-end development

864
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:11,980
there was an effort all.svg 1.2 there

865
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:12,999
was a whole bunch of stuff going on

866
00:38:12,999 --> 00:38:14,619
around us we'd be tiny for mobile

867
00:38:14,619 --> 00:38:16,059
devices you know it turns out that

868
00:38:16,059 --> 00:38:18,369
mobile devices are as powerful as that's

869
00:38:18,369 --> 00:38:20,289
no more powerful than Meyer grab your

870
00:38:20,289 --> 00:38:24,430
laptop there and that whole effort sort

871
00:38:24,430 --> 00:38:26,230
of God you know rebooted and it's

872
00:38:26,230 --> 00:38:29,200
alcohol des v-22 and it's going to have

873
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:32,380
you know some improvements over SVG 1.1

874
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:34,150
which is like I said the current one

875
00:38:34,150 --> 00:38:37,869
current version but it's it's I think

876
00:38:37,869 --> 00:38:39,549
it's more about getting all these

877
00:38:39,549 --> 00:38:40,869
companies that are building our tools

878
00:38:40,869 --> 00:38:43,809
that are all of us who are using it

879
00:38:43,809 --> 00:38:45,279
getting all these people organizing

880
00:38:45,279 --> 00:38:46,749
their community again to improve the

881
00:38:46,749 --> 00:38:48,160
standards that work with on a day-to-day

882
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:50,230
basis and I think that's really exciting

883
00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:52,660
and I look forward to using more

884
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:55,509
standards like SVG in our bucket

885
00:38:55,509 --> 00:38:57,190
applications to make better products for

886
00:38:57,190 --> 00:39:02,380
our users and I think with that thank

887
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:11,319
you thank you SAP QA and we have one

888
00:39:11,319 --> 00:39:17,109
question hello do you suggest replacing

889
00:39:17,109 --> 00:39:20,289
all images on the web site with SVG or

890
00:39:20,289 --> 00:39:23,200
do you have certain ways to figure out

891
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:27,239
which images to changes to the estrogen

892
00:39:27,239 --> 00:39:30,730
good question good question so there's

893
00:39:30,730 --> 00:39:31,810
going to be images

894
00:39:31,810 --> 00:39:34,780
that are you know more suited to JPEG

895
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:36,670
compression compression very high

896
00:39:36,670 --> 00:39:40,120
velocity compression right things like

897
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:41,680
things that you would do with Bing files

898
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:43,540
a lot of times work better with a

899
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:45,640
squeegee simply because you're using

900
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:48,700
pain actually for with with lossless

901
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:52,180
compression when especially when there's

902
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:54,340
a lot of geometric shapes and that works

903
00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:56,830
perfectly with SVG and in fact most of

904
00:39:56,830 --> 00:39:58,240
the times the tools that the designers

905
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:00,640
use to create those images are in fact

906
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:03,130
vector editors so you might as well

907
00:40:03,130 --> 00:40:04,660
output that straight away especially

908
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:07,150
once you go looking at everything has to

909
00:40:07,150 --> 00:40:10,300
be read in assets for mobile devices

910
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:12,550
things like that it makes a lot of sense

911
00:40:12,550 --> 00:40:14,590
to turn pretty much everything files

912
00:40:14,590 --> 00:40:19,240
into an SVG JPEGs not really but you

913
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:23,110
could still use them to do so like

914
00:40:23,110 --> 00:40:26,770
reference them from an SVG element just

915
00:40:26,770 --> 00:40:28,150
to get access to things like filters

916
00:40:28,150 --> 00:40:30,970
transformations again but filters you

917
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:33,280
can do blending modes which basically

918
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:35,380
means that you could dive a little bit

919
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:39,580
deeper into the stack of how your images

920
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:41,980
are composited and if you can take your

921
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:45,370
smaller you know la la si compressed

922
00:40:45,370 --> 00:40:48,100
files and composite them using blending

923
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:50,680
modes you might save a lot of space as

924
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:52,720
well I might be able to do a lot more

925
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:55,210
cool effects with those images using SVG

926
00:40:55,210 --> 00:41:01,150
again all right more questions hello um

927
00:41:01,150 --> 00:41:03,580
so when you use normal pictures they all

928
00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:06,700
indexed by Google so what degree are

929
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:10,080
Google indexing SVG even I'm just I

930
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:12,580
think you'd have to ask google that I'm

931
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:14,440
not sugar haven't gotten tests on to SU

932
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:17,050
I'm sorry I can sure thanks in theory

933
00:41:17,050 --> 00:41:19,420
though it shouldn't be impossible at all

934
00:41:19,420 --> 00:41:21,010
it's basically the same it's just

935
00:41:21,010 --> 00:41:22,840
another document but they could parse

936
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:25,570
very easily it might actually be a lot

937
00:41:25,570 --> 00:41:27,370
easier than doing single day jobs which

938
00:41:27,370 --> 00:41:31,630
you know we're all doing

939
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:34,820
do you suggest the fallback solution too

940
00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:37,700
just in case process doesn't support SVG

941
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:41,600
so load in PNG or whatever so if you're

942
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:43,340
using something like Raphael they go all

943
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:45,260
crazy and they've sort of replicate SVG

944
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:48,290
using is a single vml for Microsoft

945
00:41:48,290 --> 00:41:52,880
which is like years old you could do all

946
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:55,640
that there's also cases where you're

947
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:57,920
using just SVG as a rendering back-end

948
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:00,500
like for example with vgs but if you're

949
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:01,850
building applications it's really hard

950
00:42:01,850 --> 00:42:05,480
to do that so you have to consider your

951
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:07,970
audience and decide whether SVG is a

952
00:42:07,970 --> 00:42:10,940
appropriate solution today even if it

953
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:12,320
isn't I think it makes sense to look at

954
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:14,600
it because in a couple of years everyone

955
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:16,310
will actually have support and I think

956
00:42:16,310 --> 00:42:17,810
even if you look at can you accommodate

957
00:42:17,810 --> 00:42:21,110
xfinty has amazing support and most most

958
00:42:21,110 --> 00:42:25,400
browsers and devices I've been

959
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:27,560
struggling with working with the SVG Dom

960
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:31,220
getting assets for the SVG DOM and

961
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:33,950
manipulating them in JavaScript do you

962
00:42:33,950 --> 00:42:35,780
have any kind of workflow that you've

963
00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:38,120
used before to get those assets

964
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:41,870
optimized and just for work with SVG

965
00:42:41,870 --> 00:42:44,420
dumb how would you load it just in high

966
00:42:44,420 --> 00:42:47,270
level general do you mean I spent your

967
00:42:47,270 --> 00:42:51,260
assets what happens its assets that you

968
00:42:51,260 --> 00:42:56,510
can just load up into SVG Dom inside

969
00:42:56,510 --> 00:42:58,100
your document and then manipulate

970
00:42:58,100 --> 00:43:01,340
manipulating JavaScript like reading sog

971
00:43:01,340 --> 00:43:05,990
based applications okay so for example

972
00:43:05,990 --> 00:43:08,410
if you're using tools like sketch

973
00:43:08,410 --> 00:43:11,510
illustrator day like sport like the SPG

974
00:43:11,510 --> 00:43:13,660
pads if you if you consider that asset

975
00:43:13,660 --> 00:43:16,850
right so when you're doing it when you

976
00:43:16,850 --> 00:43:18,350
do animations you can also do animations

977
00:43:18,350 --> 00:43:22,040
along a path for example you typically

978
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:24,110
keep those in separate files and I like

979
00:43:24,110 --> 00:43:26,330
to have build tools that again I've

980
00:43:26,330 --> 00:43:29,840
category inject them according to IDs

981
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:31,940
and n reference them by ID which

982
00:43:31,940 --> 00:43:34,220
typically I mapped to a file name but

983
00:43:34,220 --> 00:43:35,510
these are just these are just my

984
00:43:35,510 --> 00:43:38,210
personal conventions it's an interesting

985
00:43:38,210 --> 00:43:40,280
question I'm sure as more people use

986
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:42,740
them use SVG I think more of these

987
00:43:42,740 --> 00:43:43,550
patterns will become

988
00:43:43,550 --> 00:43:45,800
sort of commonplace I think right now

989
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:48,440
it's a very flexible very fluid kind of

990
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:50,540
scenario so everyone's just testing it

991
00:43:50,540 --> 00:43:54,470
out happy to talk more about it as I get

992
00:43:54,470 --> 00:43:59,210
more experience with it myself hi just

993
00:43:59,210 --> 00:44:01,600
ask another question about html5 canvas

994
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:04,580
so these are most motor thing to talk

995
00:44:04,580 --> 00:44:08,740
about SVG's kind of can be done in

996
00:44:08,740 --> 00:44:12,170
ischemic campus and to me right the HTML

997
00:44:12,170 --> 00:44:15,920
canvas renders less elements in just one

998
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:19,130
dumb animal fly itself so in SVG

999
00:44:19,130 --> 00:44:22,250
actually kind of create a lot elements

1000
00:44:22,250 --> 00:44:24,440
especially when you do some current

1001
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:26,840
interactions you add my admin side so

1002
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:30,860
the I think the dogs had two renders a

1003
00:44:30,860 --> 00:44:33,800
lot so what do you think what that s the

1004
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:36,710
converse is self can be Brenda as a as

1005
00:44:36,710 --> 00:44:39,980
an image so to me is rather Easter on a

1006
00:44:39,980 --> 00:44:44,940
light so what do you think about that

1007
00:44:44,950 --> 00:44:50,750
was relevant a lot I think when you look

1008
00:44:50,750 --> 00:44:53,570
at SVG there's you can look at it as

1009
00:44:53,570 --> 00:44:56,300
there's content there sometimes you look

1010
00:44:56,300 --> 00:44:58,850
like a lot of data in your recipe and

1011
00:44:58,850 --> 00:45:01,520
it's nice to be able to like to be able

1012
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:02,930
to index it away or reviews that are

1013
00:45:02,930 --> 00:45:05,840
tools to access that data whereas if you

1014
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:07,520
render it all into a bitmap I'm really

1015
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:10,520
hard to do that it's also the all the

1016
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:13,760
geometric shapes the paths those are

1017
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:15,920
such as drawing instructions which you

1018
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:18,130
know if you're gonna draw into canvas

1019
00:45:18,130 --> 00:45:20,540
you still need a passive instructions

1020
00:45:20,540 --> 00:45:23,230
you need JavaScript doing it again with

1021
00:45:23,230 --> 00:45:26,470
SVG they become a little bit more

1022
00:45:26,470 --> 00:45:28,640
normalized sort of other tools can help

1023
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:30,140
optimize them and simplify those

1024
00:45:30,140 --> 00:45:33,260
instructions I don't think that canvas

1025
00:45:33,260 --> 00:45:34,850
has that much of help advantage of

1026
00:45:34,850 --> 00:45:37,760
performance again in various relative

1027
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:40,190
rouser but I think the number of

1028
00:45:40,190 --> 00:45:42,190
elements by itself is not really

1029
00:45:42,190 --> 00:45:45,610
metric for performance is I think having

1030
00:45:45,610 --> 00:45:48,420
more office actually helps us develop

1031
00:45:48,420 --> 00:45:50,860
because it gives you better insight into

1032
00:45:50,860 --> 00:45:53,650
how is this constructive how is this

1033
00:45:53,650 --> 00:45:58,540
module constructed again things like be

1034
00:45:58,540 --> 00:46:00,180
able to create your own custom elements

1035
00:46:00,180 --> 00:46:05,380
of the few cat but I think that's

1036
00:46:05,380 --> 00:46:07,180
something that it would be really hard

1037
00:46:07,180 --> 00:46:09,990
to see how and this for example so I

1038
00:46:09,990 --> 00:46:13,680
it's really difficult to imagine

1039
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:16,630
reusable modular interoperable weights

1040
00:46:16,630 --> 00:46:19,960
to create components for canvas just as

1041
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:24,850
we could do with HT minus eg hope that
