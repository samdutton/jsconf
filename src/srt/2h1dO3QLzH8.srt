1
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:13,680

okay so I went a little old-school with

2
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,200
my slides

3
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:18,050
there's no presentation it's like just

4
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:24,150
text pulled out the old-school ASCII art

5
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:29,130
there so I'm gonna be talking a little

6
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:32,940
bit a little bit about ext Jas and I

7
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:36,260
called this presentation UI morphing

8
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:39,150
just cuz it's like it's not really

9
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:41,240
anything animated or anything it's just

10
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:45,630
changing a UI a user interface after

11
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:55,890
you've already got it done so bring on

12
00:00:55,890 --> 00:01:12,280
my browser I'm gonna damn well

13
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:16,360
so I threw together this fake UI and

14
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:20,120
using Exige EAS this is the this is the

15
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:23,180
schedule for Jay s comp just load it up

16
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:26,990
in a in four grids so the idea here is

17
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:28,730
that the you know the customer or

18
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:30,860
whatever has already like signed off on

19
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:33,770
this layout so you've built this this

20
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:37,400
project and you know you've got some

21
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,290
editable fields and all that cool stuff

22
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:44,440
and you've got like delete features and

23
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:47,120
add features and stuff like that all

24
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:52,040
built in the UI so with the Exige S you

25
00:01:52,040 --> 00:02:01,260
can change all of that really easily so

26
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:05,840
that's what I'm are you talking about if

27
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,690
anybody wants to find me I'm on most

28
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:14,240
everywhere as Arnold Fox and I have the

29
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:17,540
code for today's presentation on github

30
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:24,949
as well

31
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:29,909
and I like bacon there wasn't any I was

32
00:02:29,909 --> 00:02:31,760
kind of disappointed there was no bacon

33
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,590
I was actually gonna have a plate full

34
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:37,370
of bacon right up here I just it just

35
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:46,459
you know we got like quiche or something

36
00:02:46,469 --> 00:02:51,389
so I I work with the xyg a lot I'm a a

37
00:02:51,389 --> 00:02:56,400
committer on their their project and I

38
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,489
wrote the learning ext J's book that's

39
00:02:59,489 --> 00:03:04,950
out right now so my first example I just

40
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:06,599
called it a that's the one we just

41
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:12,450
looked at this this is pretty standard

42
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:15,269
exg just features it's their grid

43
00:03:15,269 --> 00:03:19,230
component their editor good component a

44
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:21,719
couple of things like json reader and

45
00:03:21,719 --> 00:03:30,360
and just really standard stuff

46
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:32,830
so what I'm gonna do is pretend that the

47
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:37,690
client came and said you know I just

48
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:41,680
don't like that's layout anymore this

49
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:46,480
for side by side so let's let's make it

50
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,590
into tabs or something

51
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:53,410
so we'll put all the grids into their

52
00:03:53,410 --> 00:04:03,140
own tab

53
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:07,319
so the difference between having four

54
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:09,360
grids side-by-side and four grids in

55
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,690
four separate tabs here's an example of

56
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:16,109
the diff between that so we're only

57
00:04:16,109 --> 00:04:18,690
looking at you know two lines removed

58
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:22,740
and three lines added and all of our

59
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:26,100
features still work you can still edit

60
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:29,370
the fields you know you can still add

61
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:33,870
all this stuff still works the same as

62
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:37,320
when the panels are side-by-side now

63
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:39,120
that that's a pretty that's pretty

64
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:44,280
straightforward one so let's move on to

65
00:04:44,280 --> 00:05:05,549
another example

66
00:05:05,559 --> 00:05:09,959
all right so my next example is a

67
00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:14,519
variation of the the first two basically

68
00:05:14,519 --> 00:05:17,709
so it's going to be grid side by side

69
00:05:17,709 --> 00:05:26,730
but they're in tabs as well

70
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:28,780
this is a pretty typical thing a climb I

71
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:32,440
do is come to you and say you know yeah

72
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:34,180
I don't want those in four tabs now I

73
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:35,620
just want him in two and put them

74
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:39,250
side-by-side again everything stays the

75
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:41,830
same all the editing still works all the

76
00:05:41,830 --> 00:06:01,200
adding all that good stuff

77
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:03,500
so the difference there was just a

78
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:07,070
little bit more but a lot of it is

79
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:10,910
really just configurations and actually

80
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:12,590
a big chunk of it is just tabbing

81
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:24,720
because I tabbed everything out properly

82
00:06:24,730 --> 00:06:29,560
oh there you yeah without the whitespace

83
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:32,170
see that's a lot less so you know it

84
00:06:32,170 --> 00:06:34,570
doesn't lines and your UI is all change

85
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:45,390
now

86
00:06:45,400 --> 00:07:09,620
see

87
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:11,800
okay so now we're gonna take this layout

88
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:16,720
and introduce and editor and editor on

89
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:23,650
the side so the editor is activated by

90
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:29,680
double-click this is a pretty standard

91
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:35,950
ext foreign panel so we can change text

92
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:41,350
in here it's save and it updates our

93
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:46,240
grid works with the track be great grid

94
00:07:46,240 --> 00:08:05,700
as well so it's all tied together

95
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:08,210
so the difference between those two is

96
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:11,300
is pretty pretty minor because we're

97
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:17,150
really just there when I am screen do

98
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:20,480
that again so the difference there is

99
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:23,540
pretty minor because we're just adding

100
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:32,940
that editor panel on to the side

101
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:37,120
what did you use for a ski guard it's

102
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,680
like it's just a website where you go

103
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:42,180
and type in its like if you search her

104
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:45,459
ASCII text it'll be like the third hit

105
00:08:45,459 --> 00:08:52,870
or something

106
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:57,350
all right so next thing we're adding is

107
00:08:57,350 --> 00:09:02,520
abuse oh this is gonna be like to

108
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:06,480
preview the data so now I've got a

109
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:10,110
single click for my viewer down at the

110
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:11,780
lower right corner

111
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:16,130
my editor still works on a double click

112
00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:18,150
the layouts been changed but

113
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:19,410
everything's still tied together

114
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:22,310
everything's still functions

115
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:25,680
everything's still like hooked up wired

116
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:42,910
up

117
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:46,639
so eniac see everything's built in like

118
00:09:46,639 --> 00:09:49,139
components and and mostly for the UI

119
00:09:49,139 --> 00:09:50,910
stuff they're built into what they call

120
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:54,949
panels like like right here we've got

121
00:09:54,949 --> 00:09:58,199
three panels well roughly the two grids

122
00:09:58,199 --> 00:10:01,139
count as panels too and these things can

123
00:10:01,139 --> 00:10:04,649
be moved all over the page how's it

124
00:10:04,649 --> 00:10:08,550
going so these things can be moved all

125
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:11,879
over the page and their interaction with

126
00:10:11,879 --> 00:10:22,780
each other stays the same

127
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:25,220
so we've got you know our delete or edit

128
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:26,990
all that cool junky

129
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:34,240
single click you get the preview and I

130
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,940
changed it so that the edits on the left

131
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:40,070
this looks pretty awesome in this small

132
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:43,580
resolution but I change it so that the

133
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:45,650
previews on the on the right there the

134
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:49,160
edits on the left to double-click even

135
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,180
though we changed our layout

136
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:51,380
everything's still tied together

137
00:10:51,380 --> 00:11:01,970
everything still works

138
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:03,600
so each of these components are

139
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:07,830
basically firing off events - you know -

140
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:09,480
to trigger these actions so they don't

141
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:12,380
they don't care where they are layout

142
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:15,000
just fire off an event and you listen

143
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:23,220
for it it does it

144
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:24,910
you want to see the diff between those

145
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:34,940
two it's probably pretty small too

146
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:42,660
so I think that's you know F yeah I mean

147
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,519
we're just moving things from from left

148
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:46,529
to right so it's only a couple lines of

149
00:11:46,529 --> 00:11:51,120
code to change but the cool thing about

150
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,579
it is that all of our all of our

151
00:11:53,579 --> 00:12:09,370
interaction stays the same

152
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:12,230
okay so the next one gets a little

153
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:19,980
better well that is not the right one

154
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:31,560
hold on

155
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:33,160
okay so our next one gets a little

156
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:37,480
better so now our edit and our preview

157
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:39,970
is gone but that's because we've we've

158
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:42,820
changed how they show up this time

159
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:44,529
they're in a window instead of in the

160
00:12:44,529 --> 00:12:47,230
main panel so if I single click I get a

161
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:52,120
window for the view and if I double

162
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:58,680
click I get a window for the edit

163
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:01,600
somewhere oh wait I haven't done the

164
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:01,930
edit

165
00:13:01,930 --> 00:13:07,779
hold on just doing the view first okay

166
00:13:07,779 --> 00:13:11,110
so I'm just changing how the view works

167
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:13,110
how it how everything's displayed

168
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:16,540
everything's still tied together through

169
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:24,699
these events so these events fire off

170
00:13:24,699 --> 00:13:31,060
and we just decide how to handle them so

171
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:37,589
let's see what are we on right all right

172
00:13:37,589 --> 00:13:50,760
no it's been aged

173
00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:53,140
so I set up these these events that

174
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:57,720
happen in the UI and then these are the

175
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:02,010
the the handlers that are taken the the

176
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:21,980
result of that event happening

177
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:29,769
you want to see the diff

178
00:14:29,779 --> 00:14:34,190
pseudo god okay

179
00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:40,519
so that was between F and G so that was

180
00:14:40,519 --> 00:14:42,290
just oh that was the one where we moved

181
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:46,279
from the left to the right I think this

182
00:14:46,279 --> 00:14:51,480
is hard to keep track of these letters

183
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:58,250
well sometime on I but I think I skip

184
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:04,670
some of the diffs okay so here's the

185
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:07,550
change that made the preview open in a

186
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:10,279
window instead of previewing in the

187
00:15:10,279 --> 00:15:14,959
panel on the right side not many lines

188
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:18,649
and from the users standpoint that's

189
00:15:18,649 --> 00:15:21,769
that's a pretty big change from the

190
00:15:21,769 --> 00:15:46,710
end-user what they see

191
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,279
okay I wanna make sure I got the right

192
00:15:48,279 --> 00:15:53,139
one here so it should be a single click

193
00:15:53,139 --> 00:16:01,389
to view double click to edit I'm not

194
00:16:01,389 --> 00:16:02,769
sure why my double clicks not working

195
00:16:02,769 --> 00:16:06,740
though

196
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:12,610
was working earlier of course so let's

197
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:22,470
go to the very last one

198
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:40,160
all right JJ all right

199
00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:45,089
there we go okay so this is uh this is

200
00:16:45,089 --> 00:16:48,209
horrible in this tiny screen but all our

201
00:16:48,209 --> 00:16:51,959
tabs are now windows they still interact

202
00:16:51,959 --> 00:16:54,740
with themselves the same they still

203
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:57,510
they're still you know they're tied to a

204
00:16:57,510 --> 00:16:59,970
preview you can go and click on these

205
00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:05,970
different things we get we get the

206
00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:14,160
preview and the double click to edit so

207
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,480
even though everything went from being

208
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:18,120
like kind of a flat interface where

209
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,949
everything's in panels all shown at once

210
00:17:19,949 --> 00:17:22,980
to a window to interface all the

211
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:26,250
interactions still happen the same we

212
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:29,220
can change stuff and save it here and it

213
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:40,150
updates in the grid

214
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,540
and this is really because of these

215
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:46,010
these events that we've set up these

216
00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:50,570
custom events so what I've done here is

217
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:56,930
set up just four events on a what EXT

218
00:17:56,930 --> 00:18:00,350
calls in observable so which is just a

219
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:03,830
really simple component that you can you

220
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:08,000
can you know fire events through so I've

221
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,290
set up those four events and then down

222
00:18:12,290 --> 00:18:15,830
later on to my code setup the handlers

223
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:21,170
for those those events so you I doesn't

224
00:18:21,170 --> 00:18:24,470
care at all you know what it looks like

225
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:29,660
these events still fire and and act as

226
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:34,670
they they normally would so uh anybody

227
00:18:34,670 --> 00:18:41,550
have any questions about that just gonna

228
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:46,820
the first year yep yeah she with it so

229
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:50,810
this is um this is what we started out

230
00:18:50,810 --> 00:18:55,200
with

231
00:18:55,210 --> 00:19:00,710
so just for grids side-by-side these

232
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:03,160
grids they all have this edit function

233
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:06,500
in this case you know it's built right

234
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:11,380
in it's an inline editor the delete

235
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:15,980
actions all work add all that kind of

236
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:33,530
stuff so from there the next step yeah

237
00:19:33,530 --> 00:19:35,690
I've also got the source code up on

238
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:44,330
github if you want to look at it there's

239
00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:51,860
to github repo for it

240
00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:54,430
but I mean this is the this is the guts

241
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:56,260
over right here this is where the

242
00:19:56,260 --> 00:20:00,850
applications all set up like I said it's

243
00:20:00,850 --> 00:20:04,330
using ext4 all the UI work so we're

244
00:20:04,330 --> 00:20:06,360
creating a bunch of exe components here

245
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:09,220
creating a manager that that you can

246
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:12,940
relay events through and tying them all

247
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:19,000
together so for instance here I've got

248
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:25,410
like my main grid this main grid the is

249
00:20:25,410 --> 00:20:28,270
what ext calls an editor grid which is

250
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:33,070
right there I set up some basic stuff

251
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:36,520
for it like how to store the data how to

252
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:43,480
display the data so like the first thing

253
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:45,610
in there is is setting up a store that's

254
00:20:45,610 --> 00:20:47,410
where all the data is stored comes in as

255
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:50,650
JSON and that the store normalizes it to

256
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:55,900
be used by ext so the data could come in

257
00:20:55,900 --> 00:21:00,070
as XML or whatever wacky format like CSV

258
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:03,370
and and ext will normalize it so it can

259
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:14,909
be used anywhere in the XT components

260
00:21:14,919 --> 00:21:16,869
these are some events that I'm kind of

261
00:21:16,869 --> 00:21:20,549
relaying to make my own custom events

262
00:21:20,549 --> 00:21:23,259
like I take the row select tonight I

263
00:21:23,259 --> 00:21:25,539
relay it through my manager and call it

264
00:21:25,539 --> 00:21:29,259
the view schedule item event double

265
00:21:29,259 --> 00:21:32,009
click again relay it through the manager

266
00:21:32,009 --> 00:21:37,029
edit you know the ad relays to an add

267
00:21:37,029 --> 00:21:48,609
event the next item is the editor which

268
00:21:48,609 --> 00:21:58,779
I think shows up in D

269
00:21:58,789 --> 00:22:01,909
so that's the editor panel this is a

270
00:22:01,909 --> 00:22:03,320
forum panel

271
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:16,320
what do you cause a forum panel

272
00:22:16,330 --> 00:22:18,340
so this is almost like this is almost

273
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:22,840
boilerplate code you know it's really

274
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:28,660
just setting up configurations then I've

275
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:44,080
got a view panel

276
00:22:44,090 --> 00:22:46,400
so my view panel is activated on the

277
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:49,010
single click down here and it's just

278
00:22:49,010 --> 00:22:53,300
it's like some fragments of HTML and it

279
00:22:53,300 --> 00:23:05,300
uses ext x 10 + to display the data so

280
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:06,830
actually this is kind of everything this

281
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:08,870
is a really neat thing in ext they have

282
00:23:08,870 --> 00:23:13,850
these X templates and the the HTML this

283
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:18,650
used to render that little that little

284
00:23:18,650 --> 00:23:21,560
section and the lower-right that

285
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:23,150
actually comes right out of the document

286
00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:27,860
itself it's in this text area that's in

287
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:30,020
the body and it's got some you know

288
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:32,840
variables in there that are replaced

289
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:40,540
when it renders so that's the gist of it

290
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:44,630
you know if you want download the code

291
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:50,180
and play with it it's a it's you know it

292
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:52,100
would be like a good base if you're

293
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:54,440
starting out to build a ext app it would

294
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:55,940
be a good foundation to kind of build

295
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:59,120
off of so enjoy

296
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:07,040
oh yeah yeah you can find me on github

297
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:19,090
is vinyl fox vinyl fox
