can't be you this photo is from 2013

23
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:23,030
September 30 the first CSS conf

24
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:26,179
EU it was much smaller in terms of venue

25
00:01:26,179 --> 00:01:28,130
and numbers of people that it was the

26
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:30,799
same in essence bringing people with an

27
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:32,929
interest exterior city about CSS

28
00:01:32,929 --> 00:01:35,569
together in one space exchanging ideas

29
00:01:35,569 --> 00:01:39,500
learning something new how did it all

30
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,689
begin just a few months prior the

31
00:01:41,689 --> 00:01:45,250
first-ever CSS comp based in the US

32
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:47,479
Nicole Sullivan was an organizer with

33
00:01:47,479 --> 00:01:49,880
the aim to address the gap in conference

34
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:52,250
space there are already conferences to

35
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:57,349
pick they're already the focus on

36
00:01:57,349 --> 00:01:59,569
JavaScript or design and they were great

37
00:01:59,569 --> 00:02:05,720
but they didn't have CSS developers they

38
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:08,660
didn't have those topics talked about it

39
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:11,360
was something missing from their CSS

40
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,790
comp us is born and one of the attendees

41
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:14,600
of this event

42
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:17,510
Chrissa came to Berlin and a plan to

43
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:20,989
bring that conference to Europe and just

44
00:02:20,989 --> 00:02:42,760
a few months later he was here

45
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:49,580
hello can hear me yes thank you

46
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:50,750
[Applause]

00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:57,300
great so so back in 2013 first ever

48
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:00,590
conference and and now six years later

49
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:04,650
six events later I should say we're here

50
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:08,069
what have we achieved throughout the

51
00:03:08,069 --> 00:03:09,660
years they've been so many fascinating

52
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:12,420
talks the topics talked about and share

53
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:13,860
to a wider audience from new

54
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:16,110
specifications such as CSS grid and

55
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:19,230
variable fonts to CSS animation to new

56
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:20,610
developer tools and techniques for

57
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:23,060
writing CSS such as CSS and jeaious

58
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:25,260
there's a wealth of content that's

59
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:27,030
available in the back catalogue of

60
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:29,850
conferences and videos online these

61
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:31,800
videos are now available for developers

62
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,840
and would-be developers to watch learn

63
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:38,190
from and be inspired one of my favorite

64
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:39,810
aspects of this conference is the

65
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:41,910
scholarship program for people who

66
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:44,269
otherwise wouldn't be able to attend

67
00:03:44,269 --> 00:03:48,030
over the years and amazing 166 people

68
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:49,709
have received scholarships to attend

69
00:03:49,709 --> 00:03:52,799
this conference for many recipients of

70
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:54,239
that scholarship is the first time

71
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:55,560
they've been able to take part in the

72
00:03:55,560 --> 00:04:00,959
broader developer community inspired by

73
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:03,360
this main conference CSS classes has

74
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,190
been offered in multiple cities Berlin

75
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:06,660
Hamburg Prague and suit to be an

76
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:09,380
Amsterdam a way to introduce people to

77
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:13,920
programming via CSS whether you're a

78
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,510
beginner or have been programming for

79
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:18,030
years the ethos of CSS comp remains the

80
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:21,479
same to welcome people into web but it's

81
00:04:21,479 --> 00:04:24,840
become a global movement CSS comp us

82
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:28,200
Australia Norway and Argentina Asia and

83
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,810
sivan some upcoming ones in beautiful in

84
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:37,050
Colombia from the start

85
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:40,200
CSS con tu has had a open call for

86
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:43,560
proposals this means that anyone no

87
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,150
matter their background or relative

88
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:47,580
experience could have a shot of being on

89
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:51,570
stage two years ago I gave my very first

90
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:53,169
conference talk on the stage

91
00:04:53,169 --> 00:04:55,840
at that point I'd only been a developer

92
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:59,379
for about a year and half I didn't know

93
00:04:59,379 --> 00:05:01,180
much about confident speaking or how to

94
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:03,479
write an abstract for a tech event and

95
00:05:03,479 --> 00:05:06,069
when it came to deciding on a talk and

96
00:05:06,069 --> 00:05:09,039
helping refine an abstract polishing the

97
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:12,789
talk every stage is able to get support

98
00:05:12,789 --> 00:05:14,529
and encouragement from different members

99
00:05:14,529 --> 00:05:17,529
of this community how did I meet those

100
00:05:17,529 --> 00:05:18,039
people

101
00:05:18,039 --> 00:05:20,590
it was during breaks during the events

102
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:24,759
conferences meetups asking questions on

103
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:26,560
Twitter sharing my interest to learn

104
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:33,279
asking for advice so keep in touch with

105
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:35,020
the people here not here today for the

106
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:37,659
first time if you heard a great

107
00:05:37,659 --> 00:05:39,550
community lightning talk drop them a

108
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:42,430
message afterwards if there's a speaker

109
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:43,990
who's inspired you to try out something

110
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:46,949
new share that with them and more widely

111
00:05:46,949 --> 00:05:49,509
the connections you've made the

112
00:05:49,509 --> 00:05:51,189
relationships you've built today will be

113
00:05:51,189 --> 00:05:58,839
invaluable it can be incredibly helpful

114
00:05:58,839 --> 00:06:02,129
to hear about people's experiences I

115
00:06:02,129 --> 00:06:06,460
have a challenge for you what do you

116
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:09,870
have to offer if you're a web developer

117
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:12,310
maybe it's a half hour chat talking

118
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:14,289
about what your job is like that could

119
00:06:14,289 --> 00:06:15,909
help a person considering a change in

120
00:06:15,909 --> 00:06:17,830
their career have a really clear idea of

121
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:19,330
what opportunities are available to them

122
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:22,539
and how they can achieve their goals if

123
00:06:22,539 --> 00:06:24,069
you're a native English speaker maybe

124
00:06:24,069 --> 00:06:25,810
offer to edit a talk to abstract the

125
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:29,319
seminars if you're brand new to using a

126
00:06:29,319 --> 00:06:31,870
tool or a library sharing your

127
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:34,389
experience about how it was just to use

128
00:06:34,389 --> 00:06:36,539
that can be great for the main Tanners a

129
00:06:36,539 --> 00:06:38,759
fresh perspective

130
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:41,199
Rachel Andrew mentioned this morning

131
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:43,149
have feedback from you to the CSS

132
00:06:43,149 --> 00:06:44,620
working group of hours vendors can be

133
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:48,189
really work useful but the development

134
00:06:48,189 --> 00:06:52,659
of tech if you find it stressful talking

135
00:06:52,659 --> 00:06:54,669
to people at events that's fine as well

136
00:06:54,669 --> 00:06:56,949
you can share your advice in blog posts

137
00:06:56,949 --> 00:06:58,689
maybe or maybe briefly on a credit

138
00:06:58,689 --> 00:07:02,139
Twitter dick Q&A you have your unique

139
00:07:02,139 --> 00:07:03,089
perspective

140
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:05,279
and being able to share that with others

141
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:13,649
is a wonder often who we talk about

142
00:07:13,649 --> 00:07:17,219
community of web developers designers

143
00:07:17,219 --> 00:07:21,239
and more but what does the CSS community

144
00:07:21,239 --> 00:07:24,119
mean here it could just mean having a

145
00:07:24,119 --> 00:07:27,119
common interest but is it superficially

146
00:07:27,119 --> 00:07:29,999
just that we write CSS what could it be

147
00:07:29,999 --> 00:07:33,479
more than that what creates that slate

148
00:07:33,479 --> 00:07:36,449
sense of belonging having a supportive

149
00:07:36,449 --> 00:07:40,499
place my view that it's something we all

150
00:07:40,499 --> 00:07:43,049
have a part in whether we've been on web

151
00:07:43,049 --> 00:07:45,059
development for decades or whether we're

152
00:07:45,059 --> 00:07:55,130
just starting to explore it right now

153
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:57,760
many technical fields have their areas

154
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:01,290
of tension and CSS isn't an exception I

155
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:03,670
want to examine some things that I've

156
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:06,970
noticed that aren't liking so well some

157
00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:09,490
things that can be jarring some things

158
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:13,510
that we can reflect on over the past

159
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:15,100
couple of years has been a swell of

160
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:17,770
argue pitting two approaches against one

161
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:21,400
another your ask the picker site are you

162
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:25,210
with us or against us it's pretty much

163
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:26,440
as though you're going into battle right

164
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,180
as though if you should be part of a

165
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:29,950
clique a group have a part of your

166
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:31,990
identity supporting one particular way

167
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:37,930
of thinking on one hand they're stuck in

168
00:08:37,930 --> 00:08:40,510
the past using CSS and J's is the future

169
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:42,280
how can they not see how it solves so

170
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:44,650
many issues on the other all they can't

171
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:45,850
be bothered to learn how to use the

172
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:49,460
Cascade if they're not worth our time

173
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:51,850
what would it look like if we examine

174
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:53,740
the emotional way we give these

175
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:56,590
technical implications implementations

176
00:08:56,590 --> 00:09:02,330
and that we chose to act differently

177
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:04,450
we've been having this argument for

178
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:06,640
years and it's led to hostility and

179
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:09,940
division it's time to move on and find

180
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:14,050
our path forwards all tools have their

181
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:16,240
pros and cons we should be able to

182
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,370
listen to each other respect one another

183
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:25,350
and move on from there

184
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,459
another long-standing issue that likes

185
00:09:27,459 --> 00:09:30,069
to focus on is this there's this

186
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:32,980
perceived hierarchy where in the

187
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:35,379
industry knowledge of CSS isn't often

188
00:09:35,379 --> 00:09:38,559
considered as important as JavaScript in

189
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:40,269
the same way that front-end is often not

190
00:09:40,269 --> 00:09:42,249
considered as important as back and work

191
00:09:42,249 --> 00:09:45,790
such as note as Ivana McConnell said on

192
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:47,170
the stage two years ago there's a

193
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:50,139
hierarchy problem this constructed

194
00:09:50,139 --> 00:09:51,939
hierarchy means people who are C's

195
00:09:51,939 --> 00:09:55,029
people who see a specialist often played

196
00:09:55,029 --> 00:09:58,360
less than JavaScript specialists career

197
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,249
progression within organizations are

198
00:10:00,249 --> 00:10:02,949
often stunted a JavaScript specialist

199
00:10:02,949 --> 00:10:07,059
can gain a seniority quite quickly or as

200
00:10:07,059 --> 00:10:08,559
the CSS specialist often needs to go

201
00:10:08,559 --> 00:10:10,420
above and beyond to prove the expertise

202
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:15,699
is just as valuable what can we do to

203
00:10:15,699 --> 00:10:16,889
change this

204
00:10:16,889 --> 00:10:19,600
it'll take a concerted effort on behalf

205
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:23,290
of us all the language you use when

206
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:25,959
talking about expertise in spaces like

207
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:31,269
this online in meetups in offices it's

208
00:10:31,269 --> 00:10:33,100
important to pay attention to this note

209
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:35,439
what assumptions you're making will all

210
00:10:35,439 --> 00:10:36,790
work assumptions you're hearing others

211
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:40,869
make and then act on changing that it's

212
00:10:40,869 --> 00:10:42,939
only by respecting others expertise is

213
00:10:42,939 --> 00:10:44,799
valid can we get rid of these false

214
00:10:44,799 --> 00:10:53,960
hierarchies of importance

215
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:57,179
we have in the space missing talks over

216
00:10:57,179 --> 00:10:59,399
the community lounge as well as talks on

217
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:03,539
stage when we leave here it's not just

218
00:11:03,539 --> 00:11:04,679
with a pocket full of stickers and

219
00:11:04,679 --> 00:11:08,119
badges as nice as well

220
00:11:08,119 --> 00:11:10,859
it's experiences that we take away and

221
00:11:10,859 --> 00:11:20,559
that inform us how we can step forwards

222
00:11:20,569 --> 00:11:22,919
inclusion is going out of your way to

223
00:11:22,919 --> 00:11:24,359
make a space welcoming to other

224
00:11:24,359 --> 00:11:28,229
individuals it's listening to them about

225
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:32,069
what they need and acting on it in this

226
00:11:32,069 --> 00:11:34,159
industry we talk about inclusive design

227
00:11:34,159 --> 00:11:36,209
ensuring our websites we build are

228
00:11:36,209 --> 00:11:38,399
accessible and don't form barriers to

229
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:42,829
people well about our own tech spaces

230
00:11:42,829 --> 00:11:45,989
physical spaces like this conference we

231
00:11:45,989 --> 00:11:48,419
have live captions to enable those with

232
00:11:48,419 --> 00:11:49,499
hearing and parents to be able to

233
00:11:49,499 --> 00:11:50,819
participate in real time at the

234
00:11:50,819 --> 00:11:52,919
conference we have a scholarship scheme

235
00:11:52,919 --> 00:11:54,539
that enables this space to be attended

236
00:11:54,539 --> 00:11:56,389
by those who otherwise can afford it

237
00:11:56,389 --> 00:11:58,979
the inclusion doesn't just stop at these

238
00:11:58,979 --> 00:12:02,369
doors it's about how we write our open

239
00:12:02,369 --> 00:12:04,019
source libraries to welcome people who

240
00:12:04,019 --> 00:12:05,579
don't have English as a native language

241
00:12:05,579 --> 00:12:07,979
it's about how we enforce codes of

242
00:12:07,979 --> 00:12:09,869
conduct online to ensure there's a clear

243
00:12:09,869 --> 00:12:13,049
understanding of expected behavior it's

244
00:12:13,049 --> 00:12:14,549
about ensuring those from marginalized

245
00:12:14,549 --> 00:12:21,930
groups aren't excluded

246
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:29,020
it's about respecting others often those

247
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:30,790
of us in the US or Europe Center

248
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:34,510
ourselves intact this means of an urban

249
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:37,630
so focused here every year people

250
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:39,610
expected a speakers to conferences in

251
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:41,440
Europe and the u.s. denied visas to

252
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:45,370
speak due to political circumstances we

253
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:46,690
should be using the privilege that we

254
00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:56,320
have to elevate others it's about being

255
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:59,860
curious fishing boundaries learning why

256
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:02,530
things are the way they are proposing

257
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:05,140
new ways of thinking communicating with

258
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:06,730
each other across the traditional

259
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:08,680
boundaries of dev designer browser

260
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:12,700
engineer spec proposer expertise isn't

261
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:14,590
something that necessary takes years to

262
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:17,140
achieve sometimes it can be the new

263
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:19,360
joiner to the fields who gives the most

264
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,220
insightful critique and pushes the

265
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:22,960
boundaries of what is the received

266
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:27,100
wisdom this is about inspiring a new

267
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:28,570
generation of web developers and

268
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:30,700
revitalizing the space for those already

269
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:39,600
in the industry

270
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:43,100
building community it starts with a

271
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:45,680
shared interest in our topic in our case

272
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:49,220
CSS but it grows to be so much more than

273
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:49,430
that

274
00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:52,160
it's bringing people together whether in

275
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,470
physical spaces like this one or in

276
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:56,650
digital spaces online

277
00:13:56,650 --> 00:13:59,300
it requires ensuring that there's mutual

278
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:02,330
respect inclusivity and a platform for

279
00:14:02,330 --> 00:14:06,380
sharing expertise there are many ways to

280
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:08,720
do this take inspiration from this

281
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,720
conference and others talk to people

282
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,010
about what they need

283
00:14:13,010 --> 00:14:15,230
there isn't being served by current

284
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:21,650
events and online spaces what is left is

285
00:14:21,650 --> 00:14:24,530
for you to come together to build your

286
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:25,360
community

287
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,610
thank you CSS comfy

288
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:35,120
[Applause]
