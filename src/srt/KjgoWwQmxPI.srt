00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:04,570

[Applause]

2
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:08,309
thank you let's talk in a day yeah you

3
00:00:08,309 --> 00:00:12,030
made it I made it yay I'm literally the

4
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:14,299
only thing that's keeping you from

5
00:00:14,299 --> 00:00:18,060
drinking beer so bear with me in fact

6
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:20,250
I'm here with some friends from work

7
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:23,580
they're right there yay and we seize the

8
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:25,289
opportunity since we're here in Budapest

9
00:00:25,289 --> 00:00:27,480
and it's a pretty cool place we kind of

10
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:30,390
threw our friend a small bachelor party

11
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:33,149
on Tuesday that was pretty fun we drink

12
00:00:33,149 --> 00:00:36,270
some pÃ¡linka set the name yay

13
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:42,030
that is dangerous watch out yeah I

14
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:44,040
mean we basically just ended up at this

15
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,809
bar and next thing I know I'm like

16
00:00:45,809 --> 00:00:48,239
upstairs in a bar and some creepy dude

17
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:50,160
starts like chatting me up and then he

18
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:54,059
just asked me for my email and

19
00:00:54,059 --> 00:00:59,699
it's like what absolutely he's a sexy

20
00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:04,439
surfer at hotmail.com so obviously I

21
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:06,150
gave him a fake email I thought about

22
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:09,479
giving him like some Yahoo email but I

23
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:10,470
thought that that was not gonna be

24
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:14,820
believable enough our friend is already

25
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:16,830
married by the way this is what happens

26
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:18,360
when you delay projects in your real

27
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:21,150
life yeah so I'm gonna talk about

28
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:23,070
failures which is something that I think

29
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:25,170
it's really interesting for us to start

30
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:28,350
making peace with and and just creating

31
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:30,509
a more natural relationship with since

32
00:01:30,509 --> 00:01:33,390
in our industry we really like to have

33
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:36,090
these heroes and cultivate these success

34
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:38,610
stories or how we ship this amazing

35
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:41,280
project and how did we get our team to

36
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,439
be the best team in the world but you

37
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:45,420
only got there basically by screwing up

38
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:47,340
a lot and this is what I'm gonna talk

39
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:51,689
about so what is your horse fear I mean

40
00:01:51,689 --> 00:01:54,329
the one that really keeps you up at

41
00:01:54,329 --> 00:01:59,100
night well when I was this Iza which was

42
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:02,549
a lot of time ago I used to work in the

43
00:02:02,549 --> 00:02:04,950
university today I used to do computer

44
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:07,469
science in Brazil and it was basically

45
00:02:07,469 --> 00:02:09,690
like the integrated system of all the

46
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:12,120
University and that meant like the same

47
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,280
system to

48
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,770
to attract like students be enrolled in

49
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:19,430
subjects or like the the professor's and

50
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:21,080
which classes they were giving and even

51
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:23,060
employees because there was a lot of

52
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:25,340
like research projects and people needed

53
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:28,190
to like control money flow so it was a

54
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:32,060
pretty big system we catered for more

55
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:36,190
than 67 thousand students and around

56
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:39,100
15,000 employees so it's pretty huge and

57
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:40,940
basically it was pretty cool because

58
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:43,160
like while we were students we we just

59
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,780
had the opportunity of touching

60
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:46,670
basically everything on that stack and

61
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:48,709
that is like front-end back-end database

62
00:02:48,709 --> 00:02:52,220
DevOps so it was really cool and there

63
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:55,370
was this one day that I was taking a

64
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:56,870
look at all the tables like that our

65
00:02:56,870 --> 00:03:00,340
database wasn't pretty fast so I just

66
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:02,420
remembered that we had a table for

67
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:05,630
employees and usually we added the

68
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:07,280
employees before they actually started

69
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,380
at their job just to keep their records

70
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:10,970
there and make sure that everything was

71
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:13,940
okay for for when they started and we

72
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:16,069
usually registered those employees with

73
00:03:16,069 --> 00:03:18,079
the salary equals to zero and then we

74
00:03:18,079 --> 00:03:20,120
would update and but the things that

75
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,650
some of these employees never actually

76
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:23,390
made it in for some reason

77
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:25,940
so what I was gonna do is just to

78
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:30,650
perform this very simple query to remove

79
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:32,420
all these like employees that weren't

80
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:35,180
actual real employees but as I was doing

81
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:39,110
that I typed the first line and someone

82
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:41,630
called me and asked something else I was

83
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:43,070
like yeah that's how are you doing no no

84
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:44,840
I'll take you there and then and I came

85
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:49,450
back and hit enter that was not cool

86
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:52,910
because what you what happens if you do

87
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:56,150
this and you don't specify where is that

88
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:59,570
you drop the table and of course I

89
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:01,690
wasn't doing anything that allowed for

90
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:05,450
rollbacks or anything so that was all

91
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:09,230
lost so around 15,000 records for all

92
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:11,590
the employees in the universities were

93
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:15,489
completely gone and that included names

94
00:04:15,489 --> 00:04:18,560
bank accounts information and that one

95
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,430
was specifically important because the

96
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:24,020
the way that the university would pay

97
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:25,740
them is that we would do

98
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:27,509
query in the database every month and

99
00:04:27,509 --> 00:04:29,610
get their banking information transfer

100
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:32,880
money and I must add that the this day

101
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,979
where this happened was one day before

102
00:04:34,979 --> 00:04:41,550
payday yeah it's a great story so that

103
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:44,509
was all gone that was all gone and

104
00:04:44,509 --> 00:04:48,150
honestly that was a moment that first of

105
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:49,710
all I refuse to believe that that was

106
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:51,180
actually happened so I tried to look for

107
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:52,590
the table over and over and over again

108
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:54,720
and that I couldn't find it obviously it

109
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,800
was gone and at that time I just looked

110
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,069
stared at the void closed down my

111
00:05:02,069 --> 00:05:05,789
computer and honestly a tear held down

112
00:05:05,789 --> 00:05:09,270
my my face and I basically looked like

113
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:14,759
this puppet monkey so that was that was

114
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:17,880
stuff no stuff but that wasn't doing

115
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:20,610
yeah that wasn't the end of me that

116
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:22,289
wasn't the end of my career it certainly

117
00:05:22,289 --> 00:05:25,560
felt so at the time and but that made me

118
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,240
into Who I am today that made me into

119
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,770
the developer and the professional that

120
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:30,659
I am today and I'm really thankful that

121
00:05:30,659 --> 00:05:33,300
that happened it taught me so much after

122
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:36,150
that we obviously did a lot more things

123
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:37,409
to make sure that this would never

124
00:05:37,409 --> 00:05:40,099
happen again we did backups we did

125
00:05:40,099 --> 00:05:42,870
well we couldn't like Jeff anything

126
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:46,130
because we did the the sort of trance

127
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:49,050
transition through that made you like

128
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:52,409
allows you to roll back operations so

129
00:05:52,409 --> 00:05:54,659
that also made our products way better

130
00:05:54,659 --> 00:05:57,810
of course learning by paying but but

131
00:05:57,810 --> 00:06:00,599
still it was pretty good and if you take

132
00:06:00,599 --> 00:06:02,610
a look at these free gentlemen they do

133
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:05,130
share one thing in common which is the

134
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:07,560
fact that they all have failed horribly

135
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:10,199
in their lives and probably that also

136
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:12,569
made them into who they are so that's

137
00:06:12,569 --> 00:06:13,979
pretty cool I'm gonna talk about their

138
00:06:13,979 --> 00:06:17,009
stories and in the following slides so

139
00:06:17,009 --> 00:06:21,569
bear with me I am Iza you can call me it

140
00:06:21,569 --> 00:06:23,819
sees a Bella but please call me ISA I'm

141
00:06:23,819 --> 00:06:27,659
a Mozilla tech speaker and as Paul said

142
00:06:27,659 --> 00:06:29,240
I work at I settle in Stockholm

143
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,500
originally from Brazil and I love

144
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,310
karaoke

145
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:34,500
and one really cool fact that I found

146
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,990
out it by myself last week is that I'm

147
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:38,940
the lost twin

148
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:42,390
of the impossibru meme guy that was

149
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:45,720
pretty cool it was actually pretty funny

150
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,880
because that picture was the thumbnail

151
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:50,580
of a pretty cool video of an interview

152
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:52,980
that I did with my Yuko a while ago and

153
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:55,380
it was really interesting because as we

154
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:58,320
took this picture I didn't actually see

155
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:01,140
it I just asked like hey how's a picture

156
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:02,700
she's great

157
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:04,950
the picture came out great I was like ah

158
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:08,310
awesome so yes this is what happens when

159
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:09,720
you ask your friend if the picture is

160
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,170
great

161
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:12,960
your friend is great you're not but

162
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,310
that's it this picture is gonna be

163
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:16,530
immortalized in the Internet for no one

164
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:17,700
but you should totally watch the

165
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:18,800
interview it's awesome

166
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:23,520
okay so why do we fear failing why why

167
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:27,650
is it so hard and so crippling scarily

168
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:31,770
insanely the threatening to fail I I

169
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:33,840
give it some thought a while ago like

170
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,720
why is it so daunting and my conclusion

171
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,140
is that basically we're just afraid of

172
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:42,180
shame we we don't want people to

173
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:44,520
discover that in fact we're not as good

174
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:47,669
as we strike us to be and and that is

175
00:07:47,669 --> 00:07:50,790
not really nice right because shame is a

176
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:53,640
toxic emotion it's it's not like you're

177
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,680
you're like afraid or or you're

178
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,780
concerned about what you did which would

179
00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:00,060
be guilt or you're not concerned about

180
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:02,640
your intentions which would be like I

181
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:05,070
don't know regrets shame is

182
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:07,320
fundamentally feeling bad about who you

183
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:11,400
are this is not cool and being afraid of

184
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:14,880
shame gets you to do a very a set of

185
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:17,550
very concerning and and horrible

186
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:20,880
behaviors such as self-sabotage who here

187
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:23,820
has never procrastinated to do something

188
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:25,410
that you're really not sure if you can

189
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:27,810
do it or or perhaps like took in sanely

190
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:30,480
long to to make a task that would be

191
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,610
simple otherwise if you just take a stab

192
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:35,729
at it our or even just refusing to try

193
00:08:35,729 --> 00:08:37,320
something because you think you're gonna

194
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:40,770
fail news for you this is self-sabotage

195
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:42,270
like I've done this time and time again

196
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:45,300
and I still do and and it is really hard

197
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:47,640
because it basically keeps you from

198
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:49,440
really being good at something or

199
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,040
learning

200
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:52,199
something or not being afraid to try new

201
00:08:52,199 --> 00:08:55,709
things and also another another way that

202
00:08:55,709 --> 00:08:58,709
this manifests itself is a thing that we

203
00:08:58,709 --> 00:09:00,649
I think we're all very familiar called

204
00:09:00,649 --> 00:09:03,899
parcel syndrome I think everybody here

205
00:09:03,899 --> 00:09:06,089
has felt at least once in their lives

206
00:09:06,089 --> 00:09:08,850
that holy look at all these people

207
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:10,410
in conferences there is so much better

208
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:11,970
than I am look at all these things that

209
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:14,279
I don't know that I have to learn and

210
00:09:14,279 --> 00:09:16,769
this seems like really scary it seems

211
00:09:16,769 --> 00:09:18,990
like you deserve you don't deserve to be

212
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:21,620
where you are and that's another

213
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:24,180
manifestation of what shame and and

214
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:27,930
those emotions feel like but it is it is

215
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:30,149
very very concerning because if you if

216
00:09:30,149 --> 00:09:32,130
you do feel this way if you do feel like

217
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:34,290
you don't belong there or that you can

218
00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:35,670
never learn there would be as good as

219
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:38,009
other people then you're never gonna

220
00:09:38,009 --> 00:09:39,449
learn anything in the first place

221
00:09:39,449 --> 00:09:41,069
because if you're if you're too afraid

222
00:09:41,069 --> 00:09:43,410
of actually trying something and failing

223
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:45,449
well you're not gonna learn because the

224
00:09:45,449 --> 00:09:47,160
main way that we learn things is by

225
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:49,440
doing is white practice actually there's

226
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,779
a pretty cool paper about the psychology

227
00:09:51,779 --> 00:09:53,910
of learning that says that well

228
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:56,699
basically 80% of learning is just doing

229
00:09:56,699 --> 00:09:59,399
by practice training four senses like

230
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:02,579
the actual lectures but fundamentally

231
00:10:02,579 --> 00:10:04,829
you just learn something by trying it

232
00:10:04,829 --> 00:10:06,540
and you're probably gonna fail I'm sorry

233
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:07,769
if you don't know something and

234
00:10:07,769 --> 00:10:09,600
something is like completely new to you

235
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,089
then odds are you're you're not gonna be

236
00:10:12,089 --> 00:10:13,889
great at first or you're gonna fail at

237
00:10:13,889 --> 00:10:16,050
something so that's that's really a

238
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:17,760
shame that we don't have these kind of

239
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,430
things well you're also not gonna evolve

240
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:22,230
you're not you're not gonna grow because

241
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:24,540
if you're sag nating at a place and

242
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:26,490
you're kind of like afraid to take the

243
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:28,800
extra step because what if I'm not

244
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,720
good what if I can never get there what

245
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,269
if I try and I fail in front of everyone

246
00:10:33,269 --> 00:10:35,010
and what are people gonna say well then

247
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:37,769
you're not gonna grow I'm sorry it's

248
00:10:37,769 --> 00:10:40,139
just not gonna happen most importantly

249
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:42,389
and I think it's a very contradictory

250
00:10:42,389 --> 00:10:44,610
thing since it's such a buzzword and

251
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:47,600
companies and tech conferences nowadays

252
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,310
you have no innovation which is

253
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:52,589
something that well we know that every

254
00:10:52,589 --> 00:10:55,350
company nowadays has it's the innovation

255
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:57,329
team and blah blah blah we do machine

256
00:10:57,329 --> 00:11:01,470
learning well the way they learn

257
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:03,640
machine learning is by trying and

258
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:05,650
faily and honestly I I can say by

259
00:11:05,650 --> 00:11:07,870
experience because I try I do

260
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:09,400
machine-gunner myself because I think

261
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,860
it's super cool and interesting and it

262
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:14,200
is a really really frustrating thing to

263
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:17,380
to learn because there's so many things

264
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:19,450
that you don't get straight out of the

265
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:21,760
box because it is a very like academic

266
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,760
and theory heavy thing so it is very

267
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:27,580
taxing and if you're afraid of like

268
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:30,220
maybe not making it or not understanding

269
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:32,890
machine learning well you're not gonna

270
00:11:32,890 --> 00:11:34,810
know machine learning so these are

271
00:11:34,810 --> 00:11:37,180
pretty important three things that we

272
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:39,490
will be missing out if we are just too

273
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:43,870
afraid to fail and which was failure was

274
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:45,550
one of the things that will happen to

275
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:47,950
Bill Gates not sure if you guys know but

276
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:50,740
before Microsoft he had another company

277
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:52,980
called travel data if I'm not mistaken

278
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:55,420
the whole gist of the company is that

279
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:57,640
they they would like collect traffic

280
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,860
data from local authorities to try and

281
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:01,570
predict how the traffic was gonna be

282
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:03,700
that was like especially important for

283
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:06,370
trucks and and frights things and

284
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:08,200
shipments and that that was pretty cool

285
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,420
idea but it turns out it didn't really

286
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:13,390
work but there's actually this thing at

287
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:17,050
a at a computer museum or something and

288
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:19,810
I found the text in this little plaque

289
00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:22,060
here pretty interesting this is Paul

290
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:24,880
Allen Bill Gates a partner said that

291
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,850
well basically travel data wasn't a huge

292
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:31,420
success but it was essential for them to

293
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:33,550
actually be able to have Microsoft and

294
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:35,620
for Microsoft to be as successful as it

295
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:37,960
is it wouldn't have happened if they

296
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,760
hadn't failed first at something else

297
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,830
and tried something again they really

298
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:43,600
learned from it so that's that's how

299
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:47,290
Microsoft was built so there's a few

300
00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:50,020
perks in when failing failing horribly

301
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:52,810
at life the first one is that it

302
00:12:52,810 --> 00:12:54,940
improves confidence after you try

303
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:58,270
something you fail and you realize that

304
00:12:58,270 --> 00:13:00,280
well you know what I survived

305
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,710
that's awesome I can try this again or I

306
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:04,480
can try different things so it really

307
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,820
makes a few more confidence at your own

308
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:08,470
ability to solve problems your own

309
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:11,590
ability to recover crisis your own

310
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:14,620
ability to manage and unpredictable

311
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:16,960
things so it is really

312
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:19,029
good to just get yourself out there and

313
00:13:19,029 --> 00:13:21,070
try things for the first time because it

314
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:23,170
gets you more used to this way of

315
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:25,360
thinking because honestly ultimately it

316
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,720
is a way of thinking second thing is

317
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,390
that it just gives you tons of new

318
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:33,610
things that you learned about like well

319
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:35,260
when you tried something for the first

320
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:37,209
time that didn't happen so oh yeah I

321
00:13:37,209 --> 00:13:38,800
learned that next time I'm gonna do it

322
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,959
differently so most of these things that

323
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:42,910
we learn about programming you're about

324
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:44,980
teching about talking and dealing to

325
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:47,560
people you usually just get it you

326
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,690
understand that by trying something and

327
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:51,580
and realizing what's the outcome and

328
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:53,740
most times the outcome is not gonna be

329
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:55,720
great but that's fine that's part of

330
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:58,420
life so it does teach you a lot I would

331
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:01,330
say like it's it's you just learn so

332
00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:04,060
much more from horribly of failure

333
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:06,220
experiences than these successes because

334
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:08,290
those are the experiences where as

335
00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:10,240
something unpredictable happens and you

336
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,279
deal with it and they teach you so much

337
00:14:12,279 --> 00:14:15,149
more than just like the success outcome

338
00:14:15,149 --> 00:14:17,529
it could lead to happy accidents

339
00:14:17,529 --> 00:14:20,080
sometimes we do have a plan in mind and

340
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:22,690
and honestly the thing that we haven't

341
00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:25,360
envisioned doesn't really happen but you

342
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,070
just end up in really interesting

343
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:28,720
scenarios that perhaps you didn't even

344
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,420
know about them it's it's not related to

345
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:33,550
tech but it is a pretty interesting

346
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:35,320
story that that was actually the case of

347
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:38,020
penicillin so basically I forgot his

348
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:39,970
name but the guy that was like making a

349
00:14:39,970 --> 00:14:43,150
study on penicillin forgot to basically

350
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:46,950
put a lid on the on the bottle thingy

351
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:50,170
and then mold started to appear and he

352
00:14:50,170 --> 00:14:52,270
was like really ready to throw away the

353
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:55,660
whole thing when he actually he realized

354
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:57,610
that the the penicillin was killing the

355
00:14:57,610 --> 00:15:00,790
mode the mold so that was a pretty cool

356
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:02,440
thing and perhaps he wouldn't have

357
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,600
reached that conclusion that this was

358
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,010
actually something that was worth

359
00:15:06,010 --> 00:15:08,920
looking into if he didn't have that

360
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:11,200
accident that well you can look at it

361
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:13,000
and see okay that was a mistake but

362
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,890
actually that led to a pretty cool and

363
00:15:14,890 --> 00:15:17,890
interesting solution and the last one is

364
00:15:17,890 --> 00:15:20,800
that like for the future events and for

365
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,750
the future opportunities you're gonna be

366
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:25,029
able to recover so much faster from

367
00:15:25,029 --> 00:15:27,820
mistakes because I think it's really

368
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:30,070
unrealistic to try and

369
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:31,780
set a goal to yourself was like oh you

370
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:33,310
know what I'm gonna try that I'm gonna

371
00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:34,360
be perfect

372
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:37,420
sorry you're not but it's a much more

373
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:39,460
realistic goal to just say okay I'm

374
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:41,200
gonna try this and I'm gonna be brave

375
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,360
enough to just see what it how it goes

376
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,330
and see how I can deal with this and

377
00:15:46,330 --> 00:15:49,150
honestly if you have like failed a

378
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:51,190
couple of times at the same thing you're

379
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:52,930
just able to recognize like your own

380
00:15:52,930 --> 00:15:55,240
patterns of thinking your own ways of

381
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:57,640
like okay how does that mistake make me

382
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:59,830
feel like okay I get really anxious when

383
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:02,140
this happens so perhaps the next time

384
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:04,270
I'm gonna be able to understand more and

385
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:06,270
why I feel this way and be able to

386
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:09,400
manage that situation faster and this is

387
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,260
only going to happen if you failed a

388
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:13,180
couple of times there's really no way

389
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:14,560
around it it's just something that we

390
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:18,670
have to live with so the important thing

391
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:20,500
here is that I think it's way more

392
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,930
healthier if we're just like transparent

393
00:16:22,930 --> 00:16:25,180
about our mistakes and accept the

394
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:26,680
mistake as the mistakes of others

395
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:30,910
because ultimately it does create like a

396
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:33,010
much healthier environment in the sense

397
00:16:33,010 --> 00:16:35,230
that well if I'm in a team that nobody

398
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:38,380
ever asked me for help or says oh you

399
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:39,970
know what I just up at this thing

400
00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:43,210
I'm never gonna feel confident enough to

401
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:46,210
just go up to someone and admit that oh

402
00:16:46,210 --> 00:16:48,430
yeah you know what I tried this and it

403
00:16:48,430 --> 00:16:49,960
didn't work can you help me figure out

404
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:52,960
how to do better you're not gonna feel

405
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,910
comfortable enough and that that's

406
00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:56,710
really important especially in

407
00:16:56,710 --> 00:16:59,200
development like we can brush up our

408
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,420
tools as much as we want or we can

409
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:03,060
create the best frameworks but

410
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:05,350
developments about people and it's about

411
00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:07,900
teams and it's about how comfortable you

412
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:10,780
are making making stuff happen with like

413
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:13,240
a set of five other people that are

414
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,620
doing this with you so it's really

415
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:18,640
important to be in the same game

416
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,280
together and you know what I like the

417
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,230
most

418
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:25,720
vulnerability vulnerability in a team is

419
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:28,720
really important because without you

420
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,340
feeling comfortable enough to feel

421
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:32,440
vulnerable with other people and without

422
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:34,720
you making sure that people are

423
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,780
comfortable of being vulnerable with you

424
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:38,860
you're probably not going to ship a

425
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:41,620
great tech product I'm sorry it's not

426
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:42,820
going to happen

427
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:45,340
you're not basically you're not gonna be

428
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:48,040
able to single-handedly make a huge

429
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:49,690
platform happen you're not gonna be able

430
00:17:49,690 --> 00:17:51,550
to push like great things to detect

431
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:54,010
community so you need to be vulnerable

432
00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:55,840
with your team and you need to embrace

433
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,880
their vulnerability because that's what

434
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:01,690
makes things happen better and as a

435
00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:03,790
second anecdote there's a really

436
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:06,550
interesting story of Steve Jobs and I

437
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:08,530
think everybody knows his story that he

438
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:11,560
was actually fired from Apple basically

439
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:15,220
because he was a jerk and so he had all

440
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:18,190
these like really high level of demands

441
00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:20,710
and he was all like very hard on his

442
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:24,370
criticisms and ultimately that drove the

443
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:26,170
team's to such an inhale thei

444
00:18:26,170 --> 00:18:28,740
environment and an unhealthy way of

445
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:31,540
dealing with the product and and that

446
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:34,120
was just not working so basically what

447
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:36,010
happened is that like the whole Board of

448
00:18:36,010 --> 00:18:38,380
Directors got together and said like hey

449
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:41,140
man you need to leave I'm sorry and in

450
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:42,580
the case of Apple since it was like a

451
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:45,160
public company and you have stakeholders

452
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:47,590
that actually was possible of happening

453
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:51,040
and for him that that would have been

454
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:53,320
like absolute doom were for anyone that

455
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:55,180
is in that situation to be fired from

456
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:56,860
the company that you started yourself

457
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:59,940
could be considered like horribly

458
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:04,920
terrifyingly big fuckup a failure but I

459
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:07,240
saw this really interesting quote for

460
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:08,980
him and you don't need to read the whole

461
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:10,630
thing but basically he's saying that

462
00:19:10,630 --> 00:19:12,760
well getting fired from Apple was the

463
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:14,530
best thing that ever happens for him

464
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:16,900
because he was at this status where he

465
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:19,180
needed to be the king he needed to be

466
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:21,610
the genius guy that always presented

467
00:19:21,610 --> 00:19:24,940
amazing things and after he had that

468
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:28,600
first fall from grace he just felt like

469
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,610
he was liberated he was set free by the

470
00:19:30,610 --> 00:19:31,240
whole thing

471
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:34,360
he didn't need to be the genius guy all

472
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:36,460
the time again and that eventually

473
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:39,130
sparked his creativity to the fullest

474
00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:41,710
and obviously I'm not Steve Jobs and I'm

475
00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:43,870
not even that successful but I can't

476
00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:45,280
really sympathize with that like

477
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,560
sometimes in our careers we just reach

478
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:50,410
to a level where we just feel like okay

479
00:19:50,410 --> 00:19:52,450
wasn't accept what's an accept how am I

480
00:19:52,450 --> 00:19:54,760
gonna get bigger and that is addicting

481
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:56,590
that is kind of almost kind of like

482
00:19:56,590 --> 00:20:00,940
golden golden chains so it is really

483
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:02,620
important for us to think that it's okay

484
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:04,600
to make mistakes and it's okay to make

485
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,879
different decisions because that's what

486
00:20:06,879 --> 00:20:09,370
gonna makes us feel more created and

487
00:20:09,370 --> 00:20:11,860
more free to to think in different ways

488
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:15,190
so that's really important so okay

489
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:18,309
Oh all that said I went ahead and made

490
00:20:18,309 --> 00:20:20,440
you all something that I call the guide

491
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:23,259
to fuckup recovery and I hope you enjoy

492
00:20:23,259 --> 00:20:25,929
it I think it's gonna be useful so the

493
00:20:25,929 --> 00:20:29,409
rules are first of all when confronted

494
00:20:29,409 --> 00:20:32,409
with a massive horribly failure fuckup

495
00:20:32,409 --> 00:20:34,779
in your life first thing you need to do

496
00:20:34,779 --> 00:20:37,590
is breathe calm down

497
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:39,549
obviously because when when we were

498
00:20:39,549 --> 00:20:40,809
confronted with something that is

499
00:20:40,809 --> 00:20:42,940
unexpected and that never happened

500
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:46,389
we get really excited in sciatica and

501
00:20:46,389 --> 00:20:50,139
just like afraid and scared of how am I

502
00:20:50,139 --> 00:20:52,389
gonna do to figure this out and when

503
00:20:52,389 --> 00:20:54,669
you're in that stage of distress you're

504
00:20:54,669 --> 00:20:56,169
probably not gonna come up with a lot of

505
00:20:56,169 --> 00:20:57,879
good ideas you're gonna come up with

506
00:20:57,879 --> 00:21:01,090
that spread idea so take take a moment

507
00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:04,179
to yourself take a deep breath be calm

508
00:21:04,179 --> 00:21:06,070
talk to someone talk to someone really

509
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:09,549
helps especially because it's really

510
00:21:09,549 --> 00:21:11,139
nice to have the perspective as someone

511
00:21:11,139 --> 00:21:13,690
that is not within the problem so that's

512
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:15,580
something that for me is always very

513
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:19,960
useful so keep calm second it's

514
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,549
important to create an action plan

515
00:21:21,549 --> 00:21:23,470
because obviously when when you're

516
00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:25,629
confronted with a really serious like

517
00:21:25,629 --> 00:21:27,850
situation of something that went

518
00:21:27,850 --> 00:21:30,789
terribly wrong you you you basically

519
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:32,320
don't know what to start like how do I

520
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,749
start unfuckin this like how do I start

521
00:21:34,749 --> 00:21:38,499
making this well again so try to dissect

522
00:21:38,499 --> 00:21:40,629
the problem try to figure out okay what

523
00:21:40,629 --> 00:21:43,779
causes how can I revert this is it

524
00:21:43,779 --> 00:21:46,419
possible to revert this and if it's not

525
00:21:46,419 --> 00:21:50,049
how do I manage the the whole situation

526
00:21:50,049 --> 00:21:51,909
how do I get the data to be back in the

527
00:21:51,909 --> 00:21:53,950
database how do I get the server to be

528
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:57,159
back up and if you're not sure if you

529
00:21:57,159 --> 00:21:59,649
don't know please ask for help like it's

530
00:21:59,649 --> 00:22:02,080
fine to us for help sometimes we as

531
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,879
developers tend to think of ourselves as

532
00:22:03,879 --> 00:22:08,019
like lonely heroes but it really does

533
00:22:08,019 --> 00:22:09,950
help for you to just like

534
00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:11,570
get someone to help you and get someone

535
00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:13,820
to at least share that discomfort and to

536
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:16,970
be by your side to back you up

537
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:20,600
next up establish prevent preventive

538
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,429
measures because obviously you don't

539
00:22:22,429 --> 00:22:23,870
want to make the same mistake a lot of

540
00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:26,990
times right so it's really important

541
00:22:26,990 --> 00:22:29,570
like as I as I shared in a case of my

542
00:22:29,570 --> 00:22:33,889
happening we did establish measures to

543
00:22:33,889 --> 00:22:35,029
make sure that this wouldn't happen

544
00:22:35,029 --> 00:22:37,940
again such as trying to create backups

545
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:40,100
create routines for checking if the

546
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:41,870
database is all right create a pipeline

547
00:22:41,870 --> 00:22:44,840
on Jenkins or a CI or whatever it is to

548
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:47,659
to make sure that you have things to

549
00:22:47,659 --> 00:22:49,279
prevent you from doing something that

550
00:22:49,279 --> 00:22:51,769
could be destructive or at least prevent

551
00:22:51,769 --> 00:22:53,090
you from doing something with that

552
00:22:53,090 --> 00:22:54,710
asking for like a double check

553
00:22:54,710 --> 00:22:57,799
confirmation kind of thing so make sure

554
00:22:57,799 --> 00:23:00,200
that this you're creating a setup for an

555
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,850
environment where this is not gonna

556
00:23:01,850 --> 00:23:05,059
happen again it's important to revisit

557
00:23:05,059 --> 00:23:07,250
goals because we're talking about

558
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:09,919
accidents here but sometimes a failure

559
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:11,899
is not gonna be indexed and a failure is

560
00:23:11,899 --> 00:23:13,970
something that you have conviction of

561
00:23:13,970 --> 00:23:15,769
something that you really thought it was

562
00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:18,260
gonna work and it didn't so it's

563
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:20,029
important to revisit the goals that you

564
00:23:20,029 --> 00:23:22,309
have through yourself and make sure okay

565
00:23:22,309 --> 00:23:25,279
like do they still make sense or should

566
00:23:25,279 --> 00:23:27,529
I change something here what did I learn

567
00:23:27,529 --> 00:23:29,389
with this episode that I could possibly

568
00:23:29,389 --> 00:23:32,059
like apply two different different

569
00:23:32,059 --> 00:23:34,039
episodes and that's really important

570
00:23:34,039 --> 00:23:35,480
because you don't want to insist in a

571
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:38,000
plan that well it's like fated to to

572
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,370
fail so it's really important that you

573
00:23:40,370 --> 00:23:42,350
just sit down reanalyze the whole thing

574
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:46,669
basically regroup and finally repeat the

575
00:23:46,669 --> 00:23:49,730
cycle because this is gonna happen again

576
00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:51,590
I mean if you fail today it's very

577
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:52,970
likely that you're gonna make some

578
00:23:52,970 --> 00:23:55,880
mistakes in the future nobody's shielded

579
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:59,809
from anything so be okay with this make

580
00:23:59,809 --> 00:24:01,190
peace with the fact that you're gonna

581
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:02,750
make mistakes and that other people are

582
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:05,149
gonna make mistakes and that's okay

583
00:24:05,149 --> 00:24:07,039
it is really important for especially

584
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:08,539
we're talking about like a product

585
00:24:08,539 --> 00:24:10,909
company if you have like a really long

586
00:24:10,909 --> 00:24:12,500
relationship with the thing that you're

587
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:14,179
building you're gonna have a lot of

588
00:24:14,179 --> 00:24:16,039
convictions that are gonna be proven to

589
00:24:16,039 --> 00:24:18,679
be wrong and and it's really like nice

590
00:24:18,679 --> 00:24:20,570
to make peace with this whole cycle in

591
00:24:20,570 --> 00:24:23,399
understand oh okay things can go out

592
00:24:23,399 --> 00:24:25,499
out of what is expected and that's fine

593
00:24:25,499 --> 00:24:28,589
we don't need to marry an idea because

594
00:24:28,589 --> 00:24:30,659
it's another thing that I get a little

595
00:24:30,659 --> 00:24:33,599
bit not pissed off but like annoyed

596
00:24:33,599 --> 00:24:35,489
sometimes as ow

597
00:24:35,489 --> 00:24:37,349
we just like have an idea of something

598
00:24:37,349 --> 00:24:40,409
that would work and we try to make your

599
00:24:40,409 --> 00:24:43,440
work regardless of how many signs or how

600
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,269
many signals were getting of the fact

601
00:24:45,269 --> 00:24:46,799
that well perhaps is another way perhaps

602
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:49,109
we have to figure out another solution

603
00:24:49,109 --> 00:24:51,809
so like don't be married to ideas they

604
00:24:51,809 --> 00:24:53,940
it's okay if they're not the absolute

605
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:55,379
truth you can always like think of

606
00:24:55,379 --> 00:24:58,889
something else and for the nest the next

607
00:24:58,889 --> 00:25:01,529
story here in the three gentlemen this

608
00:25:01,529 --> 00:25:04,889
is Thomas Edison and he was a guy that

609
00:25:04,889 --> 00:25:08,879
invented lamps and Lexor City and light

610
00:25:08,879 --> 00:25:12,029
bulbs and before inventing the perfect

611
00:25:12,029 --> 00:25:14,820
one the one that got to the market he

612
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:17,759
failed not once not twice but ten

613
00:25:17,759 --> 00:25:20,909
thousand times ten thousand

614
00:25:20,909 --> 00:25:24,119
times and and that was the whole cycle

615
00:25:24,119 --> 00:25:26,099
that took him like all the way from like

616
00:25:26,099 --> 00:25:27,690
no not knowing how this would be

617
00:25:27,690 --> 00:25:29,369
commercially viable because like you

618
00:25:29,369 --> 00:25:31,409
don't you're not gonna be able to sell

619
00:25:31,409 --> 00:25:32,820
something if you're selling it for like

620
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:36,330
too much money so when someone asked him

621
00:25:36,330 --> 00:25:38,519
about like okay but do you never get

622
00:25:38,519 --> 00:25:40,979
frustrated or how did you manage to

623
00:25:40,979 --> 00:25:43,309
you're like insists for so many times

624
00:25:43,309 --> 00:25:45,570
he's have something that I think it's

625
00:25:45,570 --> 00:25:47,879
very interesting he said why would I

626
00:25:47,879 --> 00:25:49,469
feel like a failure and why would I ever

627
00:25:49,469 --> 00:25:52,769
give up I now know definitely over 9000

628
00:25:52,769 --> 00:25:55,499
ways of electric an electric light bulb

629
00:25:55,499 --> 00:25:58,049
will not work success is almost at my

630
00:25:58,049 --> 00:26:00,210
grasp so that's also a really cool way

631
00:26:00,210 --> 00:26:03,179
of thinking about mistakes now you know

632
00:26:03,179 --> 00:26:05,609
something that definitely not works and

633
00:26:05,609 --> 00:26:07,979
and it's a pretty cool way to reach a

634
00:26:07,979 --> 00:26:10,950
solution you just can do you can rule

635
00:26:10,950 --> 00:26:12,690
out things by elimination and that's

636
00:26:12,690 --> 00:26:16,019
also a very valid process it is the

637
00:26:16,019 --> 00:26:18,089
process as Thomas Edison took can it

638
00:26:18,089 --> 00:26:21,599
worked for him so that's a pretty cool

639
00:26:21,599 --> 00:26:24,659
thing cool so now you can all pet

640
00:26:24,659 --> 00:26:26,249
yourselves in the back you're a

641
00:26:26,249 --> 00:26:30,330
certified fuckup experts congratulations

642
00:26:30,330 --> 00:26:39,049
you deserve a round of applause

643
00:26:39,059 --> 00:26:42,429
when my key message here is that we all

644
00:26:42,429 --> 00:26:44,470
need to like celebrate our failures as

645
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:46,809
much as our successes as much as our

646
00:26:46,809 --> 00:26:48,790
conquests because they are equally

647
00:26:48,790 --> 00:26:51,309
important for our lives as much as like

648
00:26:51,309 --> 00:26:53,320
all the things that we do right all the

649
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:55,120
things that we do wrong teach us even

650
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:58,090
more about how to get to the Holy Grail

651
00:26:58,090 --> 00:27:00,429
how to get to your gold so make sure

652
00:27:00,429 --> 00:27:02,920
that you celebrate all of them and make

653
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:03,970
peace with the fact that you're not

654
00:27:03,970 --> 00:27:07,059
going to be perfect always and to close

655
00:27:07,059 --> 00:27:10,660
up the talk I have quite big quotes but

656
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:11,950
I would like to read it to all of you

657
00:27:11,950 --> 00:27:14,679
because I love it it's by theory our

658
00:27:14,679 --> 00:27:18,340
Theodore Roosevelt and he has a quote

659
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:20,800
that says it is not the critic who

660
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,840
counts not the man who points out how

661
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:24,730
the strong man stumbles or where the

662
00:27:24,730 --> 00:27:26,860
doer of Deeds could have done them

663
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:29,080
better the credit belongs to the man who

664
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:31,120
is actually in the arena whose face is

665
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:33,730
marred by dust sweat and blood who

666
00:27:33,730 --> 00:27:36,429
strives valiantly who airs who comes

667
00:27:36,429 --> 00:27:38,350
short again again and again because

668
00:27:38,350 --> 00:27:40,270
there is no effort without error and

669
00:27:40,270 --> 00:27:42,820
shortcoming but who does actually strive

670
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:45,190
to do the deeds who knows great

671
00:27:45,190 --> 00:27:47,620
enthusiasms the great devotions who

672
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:50,410
spends himself in a worthy cause who had

673
00:27:50,410 --> 00:27:53,410
best knows in the end the triumph of

674
00:27:53,410 --> 00:27:55,960
high achievement and who at worst if he

675
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:58,510
fails at least fails while daring

676
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:01,630
greatly so that this place shall never

677
00:28:01,630 --> 00:28:05,140
be with those cold and timid souls who

678
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:08,309
never know victory nor defeat

679
00:28:08,309 --> 00:28:18,880
