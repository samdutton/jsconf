[Music]

2
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:16,710
everyone's how's everyone doing the

3
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:18,480
spotlight shining in my face I cannot

4
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,580
see any of your faces so I'm just gonna

5
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:22,880
pretend I'm talking to myself

6
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:25,529
spoiler alert what you're going to be

7
00:00:25,529 --> 00:00:26,400
getting from me

8
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,250
over the next 30 minutes is exactly as

9
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:31,439
the title says you'll be hearing about

10
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:34,410
typography about layout and about design

11
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:37,320
all in the context of the web so there's

12
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:39,750
not a lot of JavaScript here I'm afraid

13
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:41,910
but I do hope you will stick around and

14
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:43,579
hear me out

15
00:00:43,579 --> 00:00:46,860
given this is Jay s con and all I think

16
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:48,870
it's safe to assume that everyone in

17
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:51,840
this room has had some experience with a

18
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,570
web so I'd like everyone to hold this

19
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:57,020
question in your minds for a little bit

20
00:00:57,020 --> 00:01:02,190
what does the web mean to you for me I

21
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:05,970
love the web it's the world wide web

22
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:08,610
right and I was a lucky kid in that even

23
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:10,619
though our family was far from rich I've

24
00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:13,470
always had a computer in my house

25
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:16,229
I think my parents need to do it use it

26
00:01:16,229 --> 00:01:18,570
for work or something but I was more

27
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:20,700
concerned about the games on there and

28
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:24,240
my first experience with the web if this

29
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:33,950
works sounds something like this this is

30
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:38,959
music to my ears

31
00:01:38,969 --> 00:01:42,899
and if you never heard this sound before

32
00:01:42,899 --> 00:01:46,539
well you're obviously not from my

33
00:01:46,539 --> 00:01:49,509
generation and when I think about the

34
00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:52,299
web I think about how amazing it is that

35
00:01:52,299 --> 00:01:54,369
it can connect the world's population in

36
00:01:54,369 --> 00:01:56,259
fact without the web

37
00:01:56,259 --> 00:01:58,750
odds are we would never have crossed

38
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:00,640
paths and I wouldn't be standing here on

39
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,020
this stage talking to you about the web

40
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:10,750
so Star Trek discovery anybody okay one

41
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:13,599
oh come on man so this beautiful woman

42
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:16,500
is Michelle Yeoh one of the greatest

43
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:19,120
female action stars of all time and

44
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,500
pride of Malaysians

45
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:22,989
everywhere now when she when she first

46
00:02:22,989 --> 00:02:25,780
got to Hollywood people were amazed that

47
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:28,480
she could speak English so well and she

48
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,790
in turn was equally amazed that people

49
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:33,190
in Hollywood had such a terrible grasp

50
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:35,260
of world geography seeing as they did

51
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:39,250
not know where Malaysia was I'm sure

52
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:42,099
many people from America and Europe know

53
00:02:42,099 --> 00:02:44,920
exactly where Southeast Asia is I mean

54
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:47,049
look around you look at all the experts

55
00:02:47,049 --> 00:02:50,170
no offense if you are one but I have

56
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:53,560
also met people whose idea of Asia was

57
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:58,420
limited to China India or Japan so this

58
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:01,180
is a very helpful map that I've created

59
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:04,030
to show people where exactly we are so

60
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:06,400
Southeast Asia is made up of 11

61
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,590
countries and every single one of them

62
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:12,069
has their own distinct culture English

63
00:03:12,069 --> 00:03:13,959
is taught in schools across the region

64
00:03:13,959 --> 00:03:17,079
but we have so many other languages as

65
00:03:17,079 --> 00:03:20,049
well and of the world's seven point six

66
00:03:20,049 --> 00:03:22,510
billion people only four point nine

67
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:25,120
percent are native English speakers but

68
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,340
fifty one point two percent of websites

69
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:29,739
are in English so something isn't quite

70
00:03:29,739 --> 00:03:32,650
right about this ratio the world is

71
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:34,359
beautiful because of its cultural

72
00:03:34,359 --> 00:03:36,970
diversity language is a part of a

73
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:38,799
society's cultural heritage and is

74
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:40,690
especially important for the maintenance

75
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:44,290
of it now the web is an informational

76
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:46,720
medium in that people go online to find

77
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,970
out about things even if you're going

78
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:51,069
online to purchase something don't you

79
00:03:51,069 --> 00:03:51,730
need in from

80
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:54,010
about the product you're going to buy so

81
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:57,010
the priority is always content the web

82
00:03:57,010 --> 00:03:58,959
is only useful to the people who can

83
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:02,200
understand the content on it which is

84
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,379
why I'm slightly comforted to know that

85
00:04:04,379 --> 00:04:06,640
internationalization is a priority at

86
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,910
the w3c it is crucial that a technology

87
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:11,739
meant to be ubiquitous supports the

88
00:04:11,739 --> 00:04:14,080
creation of local content across the

89
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,570
world that every writing system in the

90
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:18,850
world can be correctly rendered on the

91
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:22,419
web just to prove a point these are the

92
00:04:22,419 --> 00:04:24,610
various scripts in use in Southeast Asia

93
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:26,740
and they can all be displayed and laid

94
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:29,560
out correctly on the web today with

95
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,060
better Unicode support and phone

96
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:32,710
technologies for the individual

97
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:35,070
characters as well as various CSS

98
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:37,450
properties for overall layout we now

99
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:40,330
have a means to carve out a space on the

100
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:42,870
web that truly belongs to each of us

101
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:47,470
that truly feels like home before I go

102
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:49,030
any further I really should introduce

103
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:51,340
myself my name is quitting and I'm from

104
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:53,830
sorry I'm from Malaysia I used to play

105
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:55,780
basketball full time and it was what

106
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:58,720
kick-started my web career I also has

107
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,570
asked the harm they've introduced I have

108
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:04,450
an inordinate love of CSS to the point

109
00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:05,950
where I'm compelled to write and speak

110
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:08,560
about it including hijacking a J's

111
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:12,789
concession to sneak in some CSS talk now

112
00:05:12,789 --> 00:05:15,310
somebody once asked me this question do

113
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:17,080
developers even care about typography

114
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:21,190
and I think they do but maybe I'm wrong

115
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:23,470
I usually am how many of you think

116
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:28,000
typography is important thank you now

117
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,340
typography has always been an integral

118
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:32,889
part of human-computer interaction and

119
00:05:32,889 --> 00:05:35,229
software design there's a very good

120
00:05:35,229 --> 00:05:37,389
reason why Apple has an entire section

121
00:05:37,389 --> 00:05:39,910
dedicated to typography in the Apple

122
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:41,320
developers human interface guidelines

123
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,840
and you may disagree with me but I feel

124
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,190
that as a front-end developer the

125
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:47,560
copyright impacts how our sites or

126
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,660
applications look so we too have a share

127
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:51,669
of the responsibility in the design of

128
00:05:51,669 --> 00:05:53,700
our products

129
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:56,289
Oliver brightenstein said this in his

130
00:05:56,289 --> 00:05:59,229
article back in 2006 and he reiterated

131
00:05:59,229 --> 00:06:01,900
that the web as a medium is all about

132
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:04,780
information textual content is the most

133
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:05,620
straightforward

134
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:08,110
of delivering information on the web and

135
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:09,880
whether we like it or not

136
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:12,100
topography is increasingly becoming what

137
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:14,910
differentiates a good website from that

138
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:18,400
let's be honest people are superficial

139
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,590
and they're really short attention spans

140
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:23,290
these days the typography layout and

141
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:25,990
design of your site or application are

142
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:27,850
like the clothes you wear and people

143
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:29,590
make judgments of their first

144
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:32,050
impressions of you or your product based

145
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:35,350
on what they see there are many

146
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:37,389
definitions of typography out there and

147
00:06:37,389 --> 00:06:39,250
I personally like this one by Garrett no

148
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:42,160
J letters are the building blocks of a

149
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,050
writing system regardless of language

150
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:46,510
now I believe there's a pretty diverse

151
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:49,030
mix of languages spoken by the audience

152
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:51,580
here today and while a large number of

153
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:54,220
these languages are alphabetic Chinese

154
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:57,630
is not one of them Chinese is a

155
00:06:57,630 --> 00:07:00,250
logographic writing system where each

156
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:02,620
character is composed with in a uniform

157
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:05,050
Square this allows Chinese to be very

158
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:07,180
efficiently regardless of whether it is

159
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:09,970
set horizontally or vertically and until

160
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:11,860
proven otherwise it seems that the

161
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:13,840
Chinese script developed separately from

162
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,610
the proto-sinaitic script which were the

163
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:19,120
origins of alphabetic languages this is

164
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,100
why the Western languages in Europe are

165
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:23,229
inherently different from the Eastern

166
00:07:23,229 --> 00:07:26,020
languages in Asia alphabetic languages

167
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:27,640
which originated from the Phoenician

168
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,560
alphabet combine a small set of letters

169
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,510
to form all the words the language needs

170
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:35,080
for the purpose of communication Chinese

171
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,789
characters on the other hand number in

172
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:39,400
the tens of thousands each a unique

173
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,229
glyph that can express meaning on their

174
00:07:41,229 --> 00:07:43,419
own or be used in combination with other

175
00:07:43,419 --> 00:07:47,680
glyphs for example hippopotamus this is

176
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,660
an English word that takes 12 letters to

177
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:51,940
spell in Chinese we only need two

178
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:57,130
characters per ma lubinski filter this

179
00:07:57,130 --> 00:07:59,620
is a German word that takes 14 letters

180
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:04,850
to spell in Chinese we can say bunny

181
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:08,110
green - oi director this is an Irish

182
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:12,120
word of 21 letters and again in Chinese

183
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:15,630
show you what can I say Chinese is a

184
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:18,610
concise language

185
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:21,259
the appearance of the earliest letter

186
00:08:21,259 --> 00:08:23,239
forms was directly influenced by the

187
00:08:23,239 --> 00:08:25,279
tools that were used to create them and

188
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:27,529
they continually involved in tandem with

189
00:08:27,529 --> 00:08:29,119
the limitations of the technologies of

190
00:08:29,119 --> 00:08:30,919
their time so take the Latin alphabet

191
00:08:30,919 --> 00:08:33,740
for example which is derived from Greek

192
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:36,560
the earliest letters were San serif when

193
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:38,560
writing was done with a heartbeat pen

194
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,879
service may have came about due to a

195
00:08:40,879 --> 00:08:42,649
transition to a square cut writing

196
00:08:42,649 --> 00:08:45,110
implement like a flat stiff brush later

197
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:47,779
scribes and copyists used quill pens and

198
00:08:47,779 --> 00:08:50,750
as demand for written matter grew they

199
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:52,430
developed more efficient styles of

200
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:54,560
writing evolving the letter forms yet

201
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,079
again when it comes to classifying

202
00:08:57,079 --> 00:08:59,389
script styles Latin based scripts can

203
00:08:59,389 --> 00:09:00,800
broadly be placed into two big

204
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,970
categories of serifs and sans serifs a

205
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:06,230
Chinese characters also changed a lot

206
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:07,939
since their origins it's just that

207
00:09:07,939 --> 00:09:09,379
Chinese writing went through the entire

208
00:09:09,379 --> 00:09:12,019
process of development and evolution way

209
00:09:12,019 --> 00:09:15,290
earlier than Europe the key implement of

210
00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:18,259
Chinese writing is the brush calligraphy

211
00:09:18,259 --> 00:09:20,959
was and still is one of the most highly

212
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:23,540
regarded Chinese arts the works of

213
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:25,370
famous calligraphers were used as the

214
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:27,470
basis for carving wood blocks for

215
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:30,889
printing these days typefaces used for

216
00:09:30,889 --> 00:09:32,449
printing Chinese publications can

217
00:09:32,449 --> 00:09:34,129
broadly be classified into the following

218
00:09:34,129 --> 00:09:36,500
families we have some tea also known as

219
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:40,879
Ming tea kaity funk song tea and Haiti

220
00:09:40,879 --> 00:09:43,759
now the last two are 20th century

221
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:47,149
creations so it's really recent Chinese

222
00:09:47,149 --> 00:09:49,550
typefaces are extremely challenging to

223
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:51,620
create simply due to the volume of

224
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:53,809
glyphs required the average number of

225
00:09:53,809 --> 00:09:55,670
glyphs for a Chinese system font clocks

226
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:58,579
in and around 35,000 glyphs give or take

227
00:09:58,579 --> 00:10:01,040
a few thousand and typefaces that have

228
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,779
enough lift coverage to be used in body

229
00:10:02,779 --> 00:10:04,759
copy are usually made by foundries as

230
00:10:04,759 --> 00:10:07,189
very few independent type designers have

231
00:10:07,189 --> 00:10:10,610
the bandwidth for them now language and

232
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,290
writing have a lot human beings to

233
00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:14,750
communicate ideas and record history for

234
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:16,730
thousands of years and we've written on

235
00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:18,620
almost anything we could get our hands

236
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:21,529
on but right now the medium of our time

237
00:10:21,529 --> 00:10:24,199
is the screen and the browser our types

238
00:10:24,199 --> 00:10:26,000
are our font files and we've replaced

239
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,329
typesetting with composing sticks with

240
00:10:28,329 --> 00:10:33,399
yes but remember this an electronic

241
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:36,220
display is a proxy medium whatever we

242
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:37,899
see displayed on a screen comes from

243
00:10:37,899 --> 00:10:40,239
data encoded as electronic signals and

244
00:10:40,239 --> 00:10:42,459
the heart of electronic displays is

245
00:10:42,459 --> 00:10:45,040
light it is transient we cannot reach

246
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:48,819
out and touch light now the web isn't

247
00:10:48,819 --> 00:10:52,239
even 38 and this young medium is nothing

248
00:10:52,239 --> 00:10:53,529
like we've seen before

249
00:10:53,529 --> 00:10:57,399
it is dynamic and interactive now some

250
00:10:57,399 --> 00:10:59,739
designers especially those who aren't

251
00:10:59,739 --> 00:11:02,529
used to especially those who are used to

252
00:11:02,529 --> 00:11:04,899
having absolute control over their final

253
00:11:04,899 --> 00:11:07,709
presentations tend to find this

254
00:11:07,709 --> 00:11:11,019
disturbing right and although it may be

255
00:11:11,019 --> 00:11:13,089
tempting to view the web as simply print

256
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:15,279
expressed on an electronic screen it is

257
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:19,799
not it is a unique medium of its own

258
00:11:19,799 --> 00:11:22,329
when we talk about typography on the web

259
00:11:22,329 --> 00:11:23,949
one of the first things that comes to

260
00:11:23,949 --> 00:11:25,929
mind is web fonts so let's start off

261
00:11:25,929 --> 00:11:30,459
with some basics what is a font now in

262
00:11:30,459 --> 00:11:32,319
the world of metal typesetting this is a

263
00:11:32,319 --> 00:11:35,230
font which refers to a complete set of

264
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:36,819
metal types that were used to type two

265
00:11:36,819 --> 00:11:39,999
entire pages of text and if you can see

266
00:11:39,999 --> 00:11:42,819
the tiny text label this set being shown

267
00:11:42,819 --> 00:11:45,399
is four Caslon 12-point but in the

268
00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:47,199
digital world these are funds

269
00:11:47,199 --> 00:11:50,949
specifically font files for both analog

270
00:11:50,949 --> 00:11:52,509
and digital fonts you can think of them

271
00:11:52,509 --> 00:11:55,209
as collections of glyphs which begs the

272
00:11:55,209 --> 00:11:58,689
next question what are glyphs now a

273
00:11:58,689 --> 00:12:00,639
glyph is the specific shape of a letter

274
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:03,069
or character in a particular font so

275
00:12:03,069 --> 00:12:06,579
this is a glyph this is a blue that's

276
00:12:06,579 --> 00:12:09,759
also a glyph in the digital world

277
00:12:09,759 --> 00:12:12,489
everything is later so glyphs can be

278
00:12:12,489 --> 00:12:14,919
described as with an array of pixels or

279
00:12:14,919 --> 00:12:18,549
collections of vector images or parts of

280
00:12:18,549 --> 00:12:20,019
Bezier curves in straight lines

281
00:12:20,019 --> 00:12:23,019
different font formats store information

282
00:12:23,019 --> 00:12:25,480
about the font like the glyphs they're

283
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:28,119
encodings metadata about the font etc

284
00:12:28,119 --> 00:12:29,829
differently based on how their

285
00:12:29,829 --> 00:12:31,899
specifications were written because you

286
00:12:31,899 --> 00:12:34,299
know data formats right and if you've

287
00:12:34,299 --> 00:12:36,129
ever used web fonts before you'd have

288
00:12:36,129 --> 00:12:38,710
seen at least some of these formats

289
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:40,180
and if you've ever wondered why there

290
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:42,610
was so many well this little bit of

291
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:44,530
history involved here so the earlier

292
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:46,570
spawns were pixel based bitmaps which

293
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:49,270
didn't work out so well when it came to

294
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:51,670
high-resolution printing so a lot of

295
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:53,440
smart people work to solve this problem

296
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,530
and one of the solutions came from Adobe

297
00:12:56,530 --> 00:12:58,750
founder John Warnock he created

298
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:01,090
PostScript in 1985 which was the very

299
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:03,910
first vector font and it really took off

300
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:06,670
so TrueType was Apple and Microsoft's

301
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:09,180
answer to Adobe's phone monopoly and

302
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:11,950
eventually Microsoft turned to Adobe and

303
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:13,330
together they came up with

304
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:16,480
OpenType now Microsoft also came up with

305
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:19,270
e o T which is embedded open type a

306
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:21,490
proprietary format for use on webpages

307
00:13:21,490 --> 00:13:23,560
and although they tried to submit this

308
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:25,750
to the w3c as a recommendation it was

309
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:29,050
rejected in favor of more web open font

310
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:29,650
format

311
00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:32,020
now what too is simply an improvement of

312
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:33,940
a wolf with significantly better

313
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:36,790
compression rates on the practical side

314
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:39,010
of things we use the font phase rule to

315
00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:40,870
declare a list of different font formats

316
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:42,910
in the hopes that our fonts will show up

317
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:45,010
correctly in as many browsers as

318
00:13:45,010 --> 00:13:48,100
possible the number of web formats that

319
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:50,080
we need to declare has decreased over

320
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,790
the years and right now you can pretty

321
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:54,400
much get away with declaring just woof

322
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:58,750
and woof to the font face rule has more

323
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:01,990
descriptors but only these two the font

324
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:04,600
family and source are mandatory so if

325
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:07,090
either either one of them are absent the

326
00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:10,240
entire font face rule is ignored now the

327
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,570
font family descriptor is simply a label

328
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:15,790
that we reference in other CSS

329
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:17,950
declarations so even if you're using a

330
00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:20,620
font like Helvetica you can actually

331
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:22,930
call it dumplings and it would still

332
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:25,780
work then the source descriptor is a

333
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:27,370
comma separated list of external

334
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:29,560
references or locally installed form

335
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:31,330
phase names it is made up of a

336
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:33,640
declaration of the font files location

337
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:36,310
and an optional font hint so if the

338
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:37,660
browser doesn't support a particular

339
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:39,640
font format stated in the hint it won't

340
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:42,850
even bother loading the font at all so

341
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:44,440
the next three descriptors for style

342
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:46,120
weight and stretch are used to match

343
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:48,730
styles to a particular typeface in later

344
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:51,120
declarations so technically

345
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,820
you could assign a black typeface to a

346
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:56,700
font weight of 100 and proceed to

347
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:59,160
confuse your entire team who cannot

348
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:01,050
figure out why setting a weight of 100

349
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:03,300
gives them this massively black typeface

350
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:06,050
perhaps an idea for April Fool's Day

351
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:11,100
hashtag don't get fired then we have the

352
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:13,500
Unicode range descriptor which allows us

353
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,390
to create composite fonts that mix

354
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:17,520
glyphs from different fronts for

355
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:19,920
different scripts so sometimes the Latin

356
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,960
characters for Chinese ones don't look

357
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:24,779
particularly nice this is more apparent

358
00:15:24,779 --> 00:15:26,820
on the older Windows systems to be

359
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:29,430
honest so the unicorn range descriptor

360
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:31,620
allows us to specify a specific font

361
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:33,600
file to be loaded for individual code

362
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,580
points or a range of code points so in

363
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:37,710
this example I've created a font family

364
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:40,500
called Haiti Plus because you know

365
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:43,140
naming things is hard but Haiti plus

366
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:45,420
we'll use the Haiti SC font for

367
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:48,089
everything but the second rule will tell

368
00:15:48,089 --> 00:15:49,680
the browser to use the mechanical font

369
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,770
for all Latin characters instead the

370
00:15:52,770 --> 00:15:54,930
Firefox dev tools has a font panel which

371
00:15:54,930 --> 00:15:56,610
shows which fonts are loaded on your

372
00:15:56,610 --> 00:15:59,940
page and although it's really small you

373
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:02,400
can try to squint and see that both hate

374
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,500
ESC and Mechanica are loaded for my

375
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:07,080
custom font family hating plus now the

376
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:09,209
per page does not contain any Latin

377
00:16:09,209 --> 00:16:11,070
characters meccanica will not be loaded

378
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:14,640
at all because it's not needed now fond

379
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:17,190
descriptors and CSS properties look very

380
00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:19,020
similar but are two completely different

381
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:21,690
things Chris Lilley who chaired the

382
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:23,850
group that developed font face explained

383
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:26,430
it very well in his CSS talk that

384
00:16:26,430 --> 00:16:28,850
properties are requests for styling and

385
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:31,080
descriptors and descriptions of

386
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:33,450
capabilities so a font-weight:bold

387
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:36,810
within a font face rule means that this

388
00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:38,940
font can do both while a

389
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:42,000
font-weight:bold applied as a applied as

390
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,029
a property means pls style this element

391
00:16:45,029 --> 00:16:47,880
with a font that can do both it's kind

392
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:50,640
of a subtle difference so these here are

393
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:53,130
CSS font properties so from what I've

394
00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:54,810
seen properties like font size font

395
00:16:54,810 --> 00:16:56,610
weight and font style are pretty

396
00:16:56,610 --> 00:16:59,280
commonly used font stretch maybe a

397
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:01,829
little bit less and the last two which

398
00:17:01,829 --> 00:17:04,589
are font size adjust and font synthesis

399
00:17:04,589 --> 00:17:06,419
almost never seen used in the wild

400
00:17:06,419 --> 00:17:08,009
before so let's talk a bit about those

401
00:17:08,009 --> 00:17:09,779
two which were newly added to the font

402
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:12,899
level 3 specification font size adjust

403
00:17:12,899 --> 00:17:14,879
was put in to address legibility issues

404
00:17:14,879 --> 00:17:17,490
because faced us with low X Heights may

405
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:19,649
sometimes be less legible especially

406
00:17:19,649 --> 00:17:21,059
when they're triggered as a fallback

407
00:17:21,059 --> 00:17:23,549
font we can set the value of this

408
00:17:23,549 --> 00:17:25,589
property to an aspect ratio of the

409
00:17:25,589 --> 00:17:28,439
first-choice font so any fallback fonts

410
00:17:28,439 --> 00:17:30,539
trigger will have the font size adjusted

411
00:17:30,539 --> 00:17:33,929
to match this ratio font synthesis was

412
00:17:33,929 --> 00:17:35,669
put in to address the issue of four

413
00:17:35,669 --> 00:17:38,100
bolts and four italics because sometimes

414
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:40,649
the true italic or heavier version of a

415
00:17:40,649 --> 00:17:43,049
font doesn't exist or the browser can't

416
00:17:43,049 --> 00:17:45,360
find it and so the browser will try to

417
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:48,149
compensate unfortunately the end result

418
00:17:48,149 --> 00:17:49,169
often isn't pretty

419
00:17:49,169 --> 00:17:51,389
so with this property you can set it to

420
00:17:51,389 --> 00:17:53,429
a value of none to tell the browser you

421
00:17:53,429 --> 00:17:55,379
know it's fine appreciate the effort but

422
00:17:55,379 --> 00:18:00,960
no thank you now for the fun stuff font

423
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,419
feature properties which were introduced

424
00:18:03,419 --> 00:18:06,210
in fonts level 3 more than font

425
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:07,919
technologies allow fonts to contain a

426
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:10,200
lot more glyphs than before so we can

427
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,999
utilize a variety of typographic

428
00:18:11,999 --> 00:18:14,399
features like sorceress ligatures or

429
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:16,799
start numerals and so on and perhaps

430
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:18,389
some of you might be wondering what's

431
00:18:18,389 --> 00:18:20,249
the point why why do we want to have all

432
00:18:20,249 --> 00:18:22,139
these typographic features as a waste of

433
00:18:22,139 --> 00:18:24,929
time but no they are part and parcel of

434
00:18:24,929 --> 00:18:26,850
good typography which is necessary to

435
00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:29,039
hold your readers attention now the

436
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:31,049
written word is a transference of speech

437
00:18:31,049 --> 00:18:33,029
which is hurt into something visual

438
00:18:33,029 --> 00:18:35,580
which is seen good speakers will vary

439
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:37,440
their cadence they will use gestures

440
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,259
they'll emphasize certain words

441
00:18:39,259 --> 00:18:41,669
typographic features like small caps and

442
00:18:41,669 --> 00:18:43,740
correct use of italics and punctuation

443
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:46,230
they do the same for text now other

444
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:48,090
features like old-style numerals and

445
00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:50,340
ligatures they help maintain typographic

446
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:52,049
color to make reading more comfortable

447
00:18:52,049 --> 00:18:53,970
so these are the features you can turn

448
00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:56,369
on via CSS but note that the font you're

449
00:18:56,369 --> 00:18:58,590
using must have these features to begin

450
00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:00,960
with so this lot up here are the

451
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,759
features most often mentioned at web

452
00:19:02,759 --> 00:19:06,269
typography talks but almost nobody talks

453
00:19:06,269 --> 00:19:09,299
about font variant east-asian what this

454
00:19:09,299 --> 00:19:10,860
property does is allow for glyph

455
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:12,809
substitution and positioning in East

456
00:19:12,809 --> 00:19:14,970
Asian text if you're unfamiliar with

457
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:17,580
harm characters it may seem like East

458
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:18,330
Asian

459
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:20,309
just share the same glyphs but it

460
00:19:20,309 --> 00:19:22,460
actually depends Han unification

461
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:24,960
involves assigning the same code point

462
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,429
to different glyphs and has been quite a

463
00:19:26,429 --> 00:19:28,380
controversial issue which we will not

464
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:30,600
get into but the point is that the same

465
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,909
code point can have variant lifts

466
00:19:32,909 --> 00:19:34,289
depending on the language being used

467
00:19:34,289 --> 00:19:36,659
like simplified Chinese Gliss versus

468
00:19:36,659 --> 00:19:39,000
traditional Chinese glyphs Japanese

469
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,649
glyphs have their own specification

470
00:19:40,649 --> 00:19:43,140
known as JIS or Japanese industrial

471
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:45,360
standard and they too have alternate

472
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,159
glyphs for the same character so this

473
00:19:47,159 --> 00:19:49,230
property allows us to toggle these

474
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:52,649
variant glyphs and when I mentioned

475
00:19:52,649 --> 00:19:55,230
OpenType earlier I also want to point

476
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:58,320
out that in September of 2016 version

477
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,570
1.8 of the specification introduced

478
00:20:00,570 --> 00:20:03,809
OpenType font variations it was in joint

479
00:20:03,809 --> 00:20:06,059
development by Microsoft Google Apple

480
00:20:06,059 --> 00:20:09,600
and Adobe an open type variable font is

481
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,820
one in which the equivalent of multiple

482
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:13,700
individual fonts can be compactly

483
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:16,710
packaged within a single font file and

484
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:19,950
this is potentially a big plus when it

485
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:21,230
comes to performance especially

486
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:23,429
significant for funds with large glyph

487
00:20:23,429 --> 00:20:27,090
sets like all the CJK fonts in addition

488
00:20:27,090 --> 00:20:29,309
to that the dynamism of variable fonts

489
00:20:29,309 --> 00:20:31,620
is perfect for the web medium and opens

490
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:33,690
up the possibility of new kinds of

491
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:37,260
responsive typography if you're

492
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:39,299
interested in seeing how variable fonts

493
00:20:39,299 --> 00:20:40,980
behave you'll have to check out access

494
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:42,870
praxis by Lauren's penny which is

495
00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:44,549
essentially a playground for the

496
00:20:44,549 --> 00:20:46,950
available very favorable fonts on the

497
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:50,279
web so Taipei based type foundry avec

498
00:20:50,279 --> 00:20:53,309
technology aka wending cards II created

499
00:20:53,309 --> 00:20:55,710
the first Chinese variable font called

500
00:20:55,710 --> 00:20:57,899
one things in C hey and you can play

501
00:20:57,899 --> 00:21:02,429
with it on access praxis so vertical

502
00:21:02,429 --> 00:21:05,250
writing is traditionally East Asian for

503
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:07,200
Han characters which are used in Chinese

504
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,809
Japanese and Korean but when it comes to

505
00:21:09,809 --> 00:21:11,610
design we can lay up text in all

506
00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:14,730
directions if we so choose so I want to

507
00:21:14,730 --> 00:21:16,649
introduce the writing mode property

508
00:21:16,649 --> 00:21:19,289
which deals specifically with vertical

509
00:21:19,289 --> 00:21:22,889
text you literally turn the browser on

510
00:21:22,889 --> 00:21:25,529
its side now some people might be saying

511
00:21:25,529 --> 00:21:27,840
that's no big deal we can already do

512
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:30,330
this with CSS transforms but it's kind

513
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:31,830
of different

514
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:34,330
this is what happens to your text when

515
00:21:34,330 --> 00:21:35,980
the different values of writing mode are

516
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:38,860
applied the default is horizontal top to

517
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:40,690
bottom to change the direction to

518
00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:43,330
vertical we use vertical RL or vertical

519
00:21:43,330 --> 00:21:46,900
LR now when we rotate text it's not only

520
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:48,820
the lines that change direction because

521
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:51,040
each line contains individual letters or

522
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,960
characters and they have an orientation

523
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:55,270
as well so for text orientation the

524
00:21:55,270 --> 00:21:57,730
initial value is mixed browsers are

525
00:21:57,730 --> 00:22:00,190
smart enough to tell which languages can

526
00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:02,050
can be typeset both vertically and

527
00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:04,390
horizontally or in one direction only so

528
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:06,640
Chinese characters for example will

529
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,860
always be displayed upright while

530
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:10,720
horizontal only languages will have

531
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,910
their characters rotated when vertical

532
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:15,220
the text orientation property lets you

533
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:17,470
control this and you can always make all

534
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:19,600
the characters up right or sideways if

535
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:22,540
you want to one more relevant property

536
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:25,270
is text combined up right this addresses

537
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:28,030
the issue of numerals or abbreviations

538
00:22:28,030 --> 00:22:30,520
in vertical text so a very common use

539
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:32,679
case is dates especially for Taiwan

540
00:22:32,679 --> 00:22:34,630
where they use the minke or calendar

541
00:22:34,630 --> 00:22:37,179
this property that says fit all the

542
00:22:37,179 --> 00:22:38,920
digits into the width of one character

543
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:41,740
and display them upright no browser

544
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:43,690
supports in the digits value yet which

545
00:22:43,690 --> 00:22:45,790
allows us to dictate how many digits are

546
00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:47,470
acceptable to be squeezed into this

547
00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:49,870
space the range allowed is supposed to

548
00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:52,330
be between two and four characters but

549
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:54,640
for now with the old value there is no

550
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:57,309
limit so you could sort of put a word

551
00:22:57,309 --> 00:23:00,100
like hippopotamus in there it will work

552
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:04,270
but horribly squished now laying out

553
00:23:04,270 --> 00:23:06,070
content in a different direction does

554
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:08,380
require a change in perspective and I

555
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:10,450
gleaned quite a few insights from

556
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:12,429
working with vertical layout for example

557
00:23:12,429 --> 00:23:14,920
the techniques I was so used to for

558
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:16,690
centering items worked a bit differently

559
00:23:16,690 --> 00:23:19,480
when it came to vertical layout to

560
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:21,790
vertically send her a block setting the

561
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:24,010
top and bottom margins to auto actually

562
00:23:24,010 --> 00:23:26,740
does work unlike in horizontal writing

563
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:28,990
which is great but trying to Center

564
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:31,179
something horizontally is an exercise in

565
00:23:31,179 --> 00:23:36,429
pain the directions of top right bottom

566
00:23:36,429 --> 00:23:38,260
left to start getting a bit confusing

567
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:41,110
when you have rotated Latin text so you

568
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:43,270
have this header and you want some extra

569
00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:44,100
spacing

570
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:46,110
between the header and the paragraph you

571
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:47,669
set the margin on the bottom of the

572
00:23:47,669 --> 00:23:51,600
header or to the left it's actually the

573
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:55,080
left so it's kind of weird which is why

574
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:57,390
we have a CSS logical property

575
00:23:57,390 --> 00:23:59,610
specification which introduces the new

576
00:23:59,610 --> 00:24:01,710
CSS properties that are flow relative

577
00:24:01,710 --> 00:24:03,929
equivalents of physical box model

578
00:24:03,929 --> 00:24:05,669
properties so these properties use

579
00:24:05,669 --> 00:24:08,580
things like block start and block end or

580
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:10,559
inline start and inline end instead of

581
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:12,900
left and right the specification is in

582
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:14,520
the thick of working draft status but

583
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:16,140
I'm really eager to see developed and

584
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:18,870
implement it but now support is kind of

585
00:24:18,870 --> 00:24:22,650
spotty now before I discovered the

586
00:24:22,650 --> 00:24:24,750
writing mode property I did wonder to

587
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:27,120
myself if it was possible to do vertical

588
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:30,179
typesetting on the web and the answer is

589
00:24:30,179 --> 00:24:33,690
a resounding yes all three properties I

590
00:24:33,690 --> 00:24:35,190
covered earlier were used for this

591
00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:38,610
particular demo and this is a layout I

592
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:40,440
built for displaying Chinese text with a

593
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:42,539
toggle that allowed readers to switch

594
00:24:42,539 --> 00:24:44,429
between vertical and horizontal layouts

595
00:24:44,429 --> 00:24:46,590
it wasn't as straightforward as I

596
00:24:46,590 --> 00:24:48,600
thought it would be because a tricky

597
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,520
thing was getting the images to

598
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:52,350
orientate correctly now it would have

599
00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:54,299
been nice to have a media query for

600
00:24:54,299 --> 00:24:55,710
writing mode so I could lay out my

601
00:24:55,710 --> 00:24:57,659
images accordingly with the picture

602
00:24:57,659 --> 00:25:00,570
element but that doesn't exist yet so I

603
00:25:00,570 --> 00:25:02,220
ended up working around the image issue

604
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:05,820
with you know CSS transforms instead so

605
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:07,650
yes there is still work to be done to

606
00:25:07,650 --> 00:25:09,780
further develop Chinese typesetting on

607
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:12,630
the web and for all non latin-based

608
00:25:12,630 --> 00:25:15,929
languages actually so the Chinese layout

609
00:25:15,929 --> 00:25:18,360
taskforce which I am a part of aims to

610
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:20,190
document requirements for the layout and

611
00:25:20,190 --> 00:25:21,809
presentation of text for the major

612
00:25:21,809 --> 00:25:24,120
languages of China when those languages

613
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:27,390
are used by web standards the document

614
00:25:27,390 --> 00:25:29,220
will provide requirements for the

615
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:32,490
development of w3c standards affected by

616
00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:34,230
languages in used in China including

617
00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:37,559
Hansel Mongolian Tibetan and Weger

618
00:25:37,559 --> 00:25:40,650
scripts now implementing vertical

619
00:25:40,650 --> 00:25:42,570
layouts has become much easier as

620
00:25:42,570 --> 00:25:44,490
browser vendors continue to improve the

621
00:25:44,490 --> 00:25:46,350
functionality of their products and this

622
00:25:46,350 --> 00:25:48,630
opens up an aspect of graphic design

623
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:51,960
that isn't often seen on the web at the

624
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:54,840
moment for example you can make a

625
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:56,850
bookshelf style list of Post

626
00:25:56,850 --> 00:25:59,520
just CSS something like this can be done

627
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,620
by applying vertical RL to each list

628
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:04,350
item plus some padding and insert box

629
00:26:04,350 --> 00:26:05,940
shadows for the visual effect and

630
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:08,730
another idea can be for headers because

631
00:26:08,730 --> 00:26:10,710
for horizontal languages you wouldn't

632
00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:12,540
lay out long chunks of text vertically

633
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:14,190
because that just makes things hard to

634
00:26:14,190 --> 00:26:17,310
read but using vertical text for short

635
00:26:17,310 --> 00:26:19,770
titles or headers can really break up

636
00:26:19,770 --> 00:26:23,910
the monotony of a long page other subtle

637
00:26:23,910 --> 00:26:25,950
users of vertical text could be for tags

638
00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:28,080
on blog posts where the information is

639
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,880
not critical to the main content so

640
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,470
laying it out vertically doesn't

641
00:26:31,470 --> 00:26:34,310
adversely affect the reading experience

642
00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:36,360
for language is meant to be read

643
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:38,310
horizontally from top to bottom vertical

644
00:26:38,310 --> 00:26:40,980
textured largely be decorative we don't

645
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:42,300
want to compromise the reading

646
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:44,550
experience for long-form passages so and

647
00:26:44,550 --> 00:26:46,770
smaller screens we can make use of media

648
00:26:46,770 --> 00:26:48,840
queries to revert to a horizontal layout

649
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:51,110
that makes better use of limited space

650
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:54,120
now conversely there are instances where

651
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:56,160
text rotate it vertically can work on

652
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:58,920
narrow screen sizes as well perhaps you

653
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:01,410
realize that the hamburger menu is not

654
00:27:01,410 --> 00:27:03,840
the best mobile UI pattern that we came

655
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:06,480
up with so depending on the number of

656
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,770
links that you have in your navigation

657
00:27:07,770 --> 00:27:10,110
perhaps laying them out vertically on

658
00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:11,970
the side edge could be a design worth

659
00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:14,280
considering and I'm sure many of you can

660
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:15,750
come up with even more interesting

661
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:19,100
design that utilize vertical layouts

662
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:20,940
statistically there aren't that many

663
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:22,830
sites that use the writing mode property

664
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:25,230
and when I started building vertical

665
00:27:25,230 --> 00:27:27,240
layouts grit hadn't landed yet so I used

666
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:30,210
Flex box for a lot of my layouts flex

667
00:27:30,210 --> 00:27:32,400
box support is great I mean it has wider

668
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:35,100
coverage than border-radius right but

669
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:38,250
flex box with writing mode doesn't play

670
00:27:38,250 --> 00:27:40,350
too well together I'll be honest there

671
00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:42,120
are quite a large number of cross

672
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:45,240
browser issues like in Firefox if you

673
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:47,160
don't specify a width on the element

674
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:48,570
with a vertical writing mode it just

675
00:27:48,570 --> 00:27:50,940
gets kicked off the page there working

676
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:53,340
on it by the way but that doesn't mean

677
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:55,800
we should shy away from using vertical

678
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:58,110
text altogether in fact there's never

679
00:27:58,110 --> 00:28:00,450
been a better time than now to live on

680
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:02,310
the cutting edge because evergreen

681
00:28:02,310 --> 00:28:04,860
browsers are a thing now with bug fixes

682
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:06,810
and new features being shipped faster

683
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:07,730
than ever

684
00:28:07,730 --> 00:28:10,210
CSS bit I feel

685
00:28:10,210 --> 00:28:13,390
the best rollouts of a new major CSS

686
00:28:13,390 --> 00:28:15,730
feature ever with almost all the major

687
00:28:15,730 --> 00:28:17,860
browsers shipping it in March last year

688
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:20,290
by now more than 70 percent of the

689
00:28:20,290 --> 00:28:22,480
market is using a browser that supports

690
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:25,330
grip and here's a little secret I

691
00:28:25,330 --> 00:28:28,570
discovered by raising bucks we find when

692
00:28:28,570 --> 00:28:30,340
trying out new features we're actually

693
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:32,020
showing browser vendors that these

694
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:34,300
features are in demand and this works

695
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:36,580
both ways if we don't use features

696
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:38,530
simply because they are buggy browser

697
00:28:38,530 --> 00:28:40,090
vendors will think that nobody really

698
00:28:40,090 --> 00:28:42,370
cares about that feature and choose to

699
00:28:42,370 --> 00:28:44,770
fix more pressing bugs instead now if

700
00:28:44,770 --> 00:28:46,750
more of us use those features and raise

701
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:48,700
the bucks we discover it sends a signal

702
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:51,580
to browser vendors that people are using

703
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:53,140
these features and encourage them to

704
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:55,030
address related bucks sooner rather than

705
00:28:55,030 --> 00:28:55,720
later

706
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:58,960
like what Yuna said this morning so

707
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,640
here's a long list of resources I

708
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,350
referred to when preparing this talk and

709
00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:03,520
I'll share these slides for anybody

710
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:05,560
who's interested and if you need

711
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:07,660
inspiration for vertical layouts the

712
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:09,580
today yokel Weber wat site has a really

713
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:12,400
nice showcase John Simmons also has an

714
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:14,260
experimental layout lab where she

715
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:15,610
showcases all the different things that

716
00:29:15,610 --> 00:29:18,210
are now possible with modern CSS and

717
00:29:18,210 --> 00:29:21,910
even if you don't end up using any of

718
00:29:21,910 --> 00:29:23,830
what I've covered today immediately in

719
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:25,480
your next project I mean your jeaious

720
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:27,670
guys aren't you I hope that you keep

721
00:29:27,670 --> 00:29:29,920
these techniques and properties in the

722
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:33,370
back of your mind and maybe one day when

723
00:29:33,370 --> 00:29:35,560
you're tired of building the same old

724
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:38,350
layouts again and again you'll reach for

725
00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:41,980
them and create something amazing thank

726
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:42,930
you
