00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:08,230

I'm here to talk to you about cats and

2
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:13,389
the internet mostly that's it this is me

3
00:00:13,389 --> 00:00:19,270
with 12 cats on me I think it's it's the

4
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:20,890
happiest moment of my life it's at a cat

5
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:24,550
cafe in Japan I thought that was a good

6
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:27,010
way to start it out but the way that I

7
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:31,410
came up with the topic for my talk is

8
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:34,719
everybody that I met in New York that

9
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:37,300
knows me knows that I've tried to build

10
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:40,359
this for a really long time it is a node

11
00:00:40,359 --> 00:00:43,899
powered automated cat feeder that is on

12
00:00:43,899 --> 00:00:47,499
that table filled with mms it's not the

13
00:00:47,499 --> 00:00:49,359
same container that I used for the cat

14
00:00:49,359 --> 00:00:51,969
food so there's no cross-contamination

15
00:00:51,969 --> 00:00:54,609
there and so I was like I really want to

16
00:00:54,609 --> 00:00:56,140
build this I really want to build this

17
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:57,969
because last time I had an idea for a

18
00:00:57,969 --> 00:01:00,069
project I just kept on putting it off

19
00:01:00,069 --> 00:01:01,749
and putting it off and putting it off

20
00:01:01,749 --> 00:01:04,239
and then what happened was a Marco did

21
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:05,950
it and did it way better than I could

22
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:09,490
have so I just figured you know you just

23
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:11,530
have to do something and my friends

24
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:13,510
talked me into applying to this and to

25
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:14,710
note interactive and I was like I'll

26
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:17,110
build it if I get pics and they both

27
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:19,870
picked me so I kind of had to do it so

28
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:21,430
trying new things are scary especially

29
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:24,460
when you have no choice and have to do

30
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:26,050
it and if it doesn't work then you're

31
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:29,170
pretty screwed if it's embarking on a

32
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:31,360
new project or you know using new

33
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,220
technologies for the first time which I

34
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:36,190
did with this product I'm front ends I

35
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:39,820
mostly just well I do everything because

36
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:41,770
I'm the only front-end developer for my

37
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:45,040
team but I've never really done no tap

38
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,100
stuff besides here at jas comp and

39
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:52,120
Cassandra perches workshop and I never

40
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:54,970
use socket i/o I had never done hardware

41
00:01:54,970 --> 00:01:56,860
stuff except for blinking an LED that

42
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:58,180
took me way longer than I'd like to

43
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:02,710
admit so it was all totally new and I

44
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:05,380
also never had contributed open source

45
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:07,960
so I decided to do all these things that

46
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:10,330
I'd never done all at one and then

47
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:12,190
release it publicly to be scrutinized by

48
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:15,990
people

49
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,210
pretty hard to put yourself out there

50
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:21,700
mostly because a lot of people that i

51
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:23,440
know that contribute to open source have

52
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:27,390
had pretty bad experiences whether it be

53
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:30,730
just trolling like random people with

54
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:32,980
the like the equivalent of the egg on

55
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:34,780
twitter like there's a bunch of new

56
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:36,820
github accounts with no contributions

57
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:38,950
that love to pop up in every code of

58
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:43,300
conduct conversation there's also like

59
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:45,520
when you finally get that project out

60
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,230
there people won't like it and it's

61
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:49,510
something that it might not be that good

62
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:51,520
but you can't see it from that point of

63
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,780
view when you've been working on it for

64
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:55,090
so long and you're just really tied to

65
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:58,270
it there's also not thinking you're good

66
00:02:58,270 --> 00:03:00,850
enough so like all right I built this

67
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:04,060
code and it works but are people going

68
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:05,860
to look at it and be like why did you

69
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:08,050
use this why didn't you do this this is

70
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:12,100
better like you did horribly I don't

71
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:14,850
know there's also a lot of communities

72
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:17,230
fortunately I don't think Judd the

73
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:19,780
JavaScript like open source community

74
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:21,790
has this as much as I've seen it happen

75
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:24,310
with other languages but there's people

76
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:25,930
that are like if I don't know who you

77
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:28,180
are why are you even bothering to

78
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:29,920
contribute to this and they won't even

79
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,500
take you seriously or just the bad

80
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:36,350
behavior which is mostly the trolling

81
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:39,160
the kodokan duck arguments are kind of

82
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:42,640
the worst though some of the other bad

83
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,070
behavior that I've seen and experienced

84
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:49,690
is the feigned ignorance of oh you've

85
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:52,540
never used this method everybody knows

86
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:56,260
that what are you even doing I also

87
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:57,910
heard about people ignoring

88
00:03:57,910 --> 00:04:00,610
contributions so this is this is a

89
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:01,900
tricky one though because I mean

90
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:04,180
maintainer czar super busy so you can't

91
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:05,560
pay attention to every pull request that

92
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,780
comes in but if you take the time and

93
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:09,640
like submit something and nobody pays

94
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:11,549
attention to it it can feel pretty bad

95
00:04:11,549 --> 00:04:13,930
which the other side is the demanding

96
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:18,760
user base also people that use pull

97
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:19,870
requests for the sake of a green

98
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:22,270
timeline because it's their measure of

99
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:24,099
self-worth which is wrong and people

100
00:04:24,099 --> 00:04:26,229
shouldn't think that way like you don't

101
00:04:26,229 --> 00:04:28,800
have to constantly be pushing code to

102
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,159
prove yourself as a developer and also

103
00:04:32,159 --> 00:04:34,729
just like insulting the contributors

104
00:04:34,729 --> 00:04:38,400
which is ridiculous and disagreeing over

105
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:43,500
trivial things so I posted on Twitter to

106
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:46,409
like try and get people to give me

107
00:04:46,409 --> 00:04:48,599
information about their experiences and

108
00:04:48,599 --> 00:04:50,479
things that they've had happen

109
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:52,560
surprisingly everyone that responded

110
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,090
with that experiences were women I don't

111
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:56,729
know if there's a correlation or who

112
00:04:56,729 --> 00:04:58,590
knows but here's some of the things that

113
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:02,909
people said Jen Schiffer said vulgar and

114
00:05:02,909 --> 00:05:05,129
brutal harassment expectation and

115
00:05:05,129 --> 00:05:06,840
entitlement of your time without any

116
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:11,250
compensation offered another gin they're

117
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:12,960
all not they're all not named Jen don't

118
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,599
worry Jen said unfortunately the

119
00:05:15,599 --> 00:05:17,250
harassment was enough for me to stop

120
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:19,409
trying before I had other problems so

121
00:05:19,409 --> 00:05:23,069
that's where I'm at she never even got

122
00:05:23,069 --> 00:05:25,110
to get to the point where she was ready

123
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:27,719
to make contributions because all the

124
00:05:27,719 --> 00:05:29,789
bad things that she had seen happening

125
00:05:29,789 --> 00:05:32,969
which is horrible the next person didn't

126
00:05:32,969 --> 00:05:35,430
even want me to name them because they

127
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:38,159
were I don't know scared about people

128
00:05:38,159 --> 00:05:40,740
lashing out at her for saying this or

129
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:44,880
him entitlement of time the assumption

130
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,529
you immediately want feedback when

131
00:05:46,529 --> 00:05:49,099
you're just starting nerd pedantic and

132
00:05:49,099 --> 00:05:53,909
obstructing learning Caroline who works

133
00:05:53,909 --> 00:05:56,840
with Tracy and I at IBM said

134
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:59,400
mansplaining mainly and a general fear

135
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,529
that any commit I make will be opened as

136
00:06:01,529 --> 00:06:05,009
an issue and debated about caroline has

137
00:06:05,009 --> 00:06:08,460
a legitimate reason to be like afraid of

138
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:10,469
this because she writes a lot about

139
00:06:10,469 --> 00:06:13,770
feminism and the game industry and has

140
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:16,740
been a target of gamergate and her

141
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:19,669
mother got swatted so there's like

142
00:06:19,669 --> 00:06:23,729
legitimate fear that this can come back

143
00:06:23,729 --> 00:06:28,139
to you in your real life sent the pull

144
00:06:28,139 --> 00:06:29,909
requests of bug fixes that got ignored

145
00:06:29,909 --> 00:06:31,770
for almost a year after which the

146
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:33,779
maintainer wrote the same fixes and said

147
00:06:33,779 --> 00:06:40,289
oops and Tessa means planning my own

148
00:06:40,289 --> 00:06:41,560
code to me

149
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,840
and trolling Tesla made this really

150
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,510
awesome library called echo chamber jas

151
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:51,430
which is basically a fake comment form

152
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:54,790
that utilizes local storage so whenever

153
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:56,139
somebody who leaves a comment on a

154
00:06:56,139 --> 00:06:59,919
webpage they see it but they're the only

155
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:05,830
ones that see it and so people got

156
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:10,090
really mad really mad she had an issue

157
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:12,880
open that said you're fat and insecure

158
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:17,320
and then there was a really really long

159
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:20,320
issue about this person who I don't

160
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:23,560
think has any commits to anything except

161
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:27,190
maybe like gamergate block list or

162
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:29,500
something like that that was seriously

163
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:32,169
worried about the psychological effects

164
00:07:32,169 --> 00:07:33,520
that this was going to have on the

165
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,990
people that couldn't get their voice

166
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:39,120
heard and the like what was it it's like

167
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,250
as a web developer or a site maintainer

168
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:44,919
you owe something to the people to be

169
00:07:44,919 --> 00:07:46,780
able to like not mess with them sec like

170
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:48,430
no you know anybody it's the

171
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:51,820
internet like get over it so all of this

172
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:54,460
was before I even started trying to

173
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:56,380
build the project and then I was like oh

174
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:59,289
ok so now I have to do this so I guess

175
00:07:59,289 --> 00:08:02,380
instead of trying to like commit to

176
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:04,390
anything else in open source I'll just

177
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:06,789
do it myself that way so my proposal to

178
00:08:06,789 --> 00:08:08,260
anybody else that hasn't contributed to

179
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:10,900
open source is find something you're

180
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:14,310
passionate about for me it's cats and

181
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:17,169
then or something new that you want to

182
00:08:17,169 --> 00:08:21,000
try which could coincide with the first

183
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,830
make something cool and open source it

184
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:26,320
yourself like I did and then that way

185
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,880
the first point of contact that you have

186
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:30,190
is with your peers so you're not gonna

187
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:34,030
just post it out there and people find

188
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:38,140
it and are like this is dumb lol it's

189
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:39,279
going to be people that you care about

190
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:42,370
and trust and you know are there to give

191
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:44,260
you good feedback because construction

192
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:46,390
constructive criticism from your peers

193
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:48,640
is a billion times better than randos

194
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:53,440
being jerks on the internets so once I

195
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,030
was finally ready I was like

196
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:57,550
all right now here's for some cat

197
00:08:57,550 --> 00:09:00,660
pictures again these are my two cats

198
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:04,390
this is reset Smith and Rick Deckard

199
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:09,280
they're both named after Androids I like

200
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:13,060
cats like I said I'd been talking about

201
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:15,640
building this feeder forever um I had

202
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,050
the idea in my head and I was like it

203
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:19,360
would be so easy like you just hook up

204
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,880
the motor to it and write some code and

205
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:24,700
it'll work it'll be great my only

206
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:26,440
experience is with the node wats

207
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:30,160
community had been at JS conf last year

208
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:33,790
in 2014 and here over the summer and it

209
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:35,890
was great everybody's super nice it was

210
00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:38,260
super welcoming and really helpful so I

211
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:40,330
was like at least if I mess up somebody

212
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:41,470
will be there to help me and it'll be

213
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:46,690
cool I told you that already and so yeah

214
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:50,260
I built Robo kidding it's a DIY

215
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:54,220
automated cat feeder there's reset again

216
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:57,820
he's the handsome cat and Rick is the

217
00:09:57,820 --> 00:10:00,019
dumb one

218
00:10:00,019 --> 00:10:03,630
but everybody loves rick because he you

219
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:05,910
can literally like do anything you want

220
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:07,560
to him you pick him up and put him on

221
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,870
your lap and he stays and then he just

222
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:12,660
like flops over and he's the weirdest

223
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:15,990
cat I'd ever seen in my life so yeah for

224
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:19,259
the feeder I ended up using a few things

225
00:10:19,259 --> 00:10:23,009
that were new to me I use node I used

226
00:10:23,009 --> 00:10:25,889
Johnny 5 which is a node box or node

227
00:10:25,889 --> 00:10:28,980
BOTS robotics framework maintained by

228
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:30,779
Rick Waldron and there's a ton of

229
00:10:30,779 --> 00:10:33,389
contributors that are here too and it's

230
00:10:33,389 --> 00:10:36,779
great it's really easy like the main

231
00:10:36,779 --> 00:10:38,759
reason I say really easy but I got so

232
00:10:38,759 --> 00:10:41,279
mad at this stuff like the reason it's

233
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:43,259
great is it has the best documentation

234
00:10:43,259 --> 00:10:45,149
for anything that I've ever worked with

235
00:10:45,149 --> 00:10:48,509
ever and I am that horrible developer

236
00:10:48,509 --> 00:10:49,410
that doesn't want to read the

237
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:50,880
documentation and just wants to like

238
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,490
jump into it and figure it out but this

239
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:55,079
is actually helpful because you can go

240
00:10:55,079 --> 00:10:56,490
in and you're like I want to work with

241
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:58,589
this type of module with Hardware I want

242
00:10:58,589 --> 00:11:02,459
to use a potentiometer or a servo or an

243
00:11:02,459 --> 00:11:04,589
accelerometer and you go to it and

244
00:11:04,589 --> 00:11:05,880
there's code snippets it tells you

245
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:08,180
exactly how to use it there's even like

246
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:10,380
wiring diagrams for various

247
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:12,540
microcontrollers and it's it's really

248
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:14,130
easy especially for somebody to New like

249
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:18,029
me socket i/o so when I decided to use

250
00:11:18,029 --> 00:11:20,100
socket i/o I was just like I know I have

251
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:21,329
these things that need to talk to each

252
00:11:21,329 --> 00:11:22,740
other that's like something that people

253
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:24,779
use right it sounds good so I just

254
00:11:24,779 --> 00:11:28,050
picked it and it works um I bought an

255
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:30,240
arduino uno and then i was like oh wait

256
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,069
there's no internet on it you know i

257
00:11:32,069 --> 00:11:34,560
would have to like buy a Wi-Fi shield

258
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,720
and i'm not exactly sure what that is or

259
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,579
a breakout board and i have no idea what

260
00:11:38,579 --> 00:11:40,439
that is so I was like okay I'm going to

261
00:11:40,439 --> 00:11:41,850
try something else so I bought an

262
00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:45,149
Arduino you and then Rick was like oh

263
00:11:45,149 --> 00:11:46,829
the Johnny Five support for that's not

264
00:11:46,829 --> 00:11:49,920
good and I was like okay so i bought a

265
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,709
particle photon so the project itself is

266
00:11:52,709 --> 00:11:54,509
cheap but that's when you buy the right

267
00:11:54,509 --> 00:11:56,890
parts first and not all the wrong ones

268
00:11:56,890 --> 00:11:58,850
don't worry i bought all the wrong ones

269
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:02,390
for you um the parts that you actually

270
00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:05,390
need for the project are a dry-goods

271
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:07,910
dispenser which is the thing that has

272
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:09,890
the mms and it's basically if you've

273
00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:11,510
ever been to a continental breakfast

274
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:14,870
you've dispensed goods it's like 12 or

275
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:18,590
16 dollars on Amazon you need a particle

276
00:12:18,590 --> 00:12:20,480
photon kit with a breadboard if you

277
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,400
already have a breadboard and you just

278
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,170
need the particle photon it's like

279
00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:26,360
nineteen dollars for the photon and then

280
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:30,590
the kit is 29 I think if you bought it

281
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:33,800
on Black Friday there was a sale you

282
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:36,110
need a continuous servo which is a

283
00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:38,180
server that's continuous which means it

284
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:39,880
can keep on turning over and over again

285
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:44,660
a four double a battery pack with an on

286
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:47,840
and off switch the photon itself doesn't

287
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:50,330
have enough power to run the motor on

288
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:52,670
the servo so you need to power it

289
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:55,220
externally and as I'm finding out that

290
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:57,050
that's actually probably not the best

291
00:12:57,050 --> 00:12:58,910
solution because the batteries don't

292
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:01,490
last long at all so if you think this is

293
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:03,560
cool wait a minute and let me fix it and

294
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:05,180
then it will be even better but for now

295
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:06,890
for double-a battery pack it's two

296
00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:09,260
dollars it's fine that it's cheap and

297
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:11,030
then miscellaneous hardware accessories

298
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:13,580
which are male to male jumper wires a

299
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:16,220
soldering iron and heat shrink if you

300
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:17,630
already have those laying around great

301
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:20,839
that saves you more money so yeah when I

302
00:13:20,839 --> 00:13:23,660
first got started the way that it felt

303
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:25,210
trying to put this together was like

304
00:13:25,210 --> 00:13:30,920
this just trying to fit things but uh

305
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:33,380
things things were okay they went pretty

306
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:36,470
smooth when I started wiring it together

307
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:38,990
it went really easy of the coat I

308
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:41,900
started it all off with them I wrote my

309
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:45,320
code so that I had a element on the web

310
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:49,130
and then I had the controller on my

311
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:51,350
server code and I just started off with

312
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:53,270
LED blinking because I was like okay if

313
00:13:53,270 --> 00:13:54,620
I can push a button and get the led to

314
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:55,880
blink then I can just swap out the motor

315
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,260
and it'll be super easy and it'll be

316
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:59,930
done it'll work it'll be good um but I

317
00:13:59,930 --> 00:14:01,940
didn't think about the fact that I had

318
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:05,300
to like do math with electricity stuff

319
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:08,150
and I was afraid that I was going to

320
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:10,400
like electrocute myself the whole time

321
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,720
also didn't realize that I needed to

322
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,190
power the servo I thought it would like

323
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:15,080
magically work by plugging things in

324
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:17,810
because I don't know you connect it and

325
00:14:17,810 --> 00:14:20,000
it should go in my head that was like

326
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,650
how it works I also didn't know how to

327
00:14:21,650 --> 00:14:24,890
solder but I luckily typed into youtube

328
00:14:24,890 --> 00:14:26,780
how to solder and this really awesome

329
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:31,610
doomsday prepper had a video and he was

330
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:33,740
like all you do he was talking about a

331
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:37,310
lot of other stuff too but it was it was

332
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:39,110
really easy and I was surprised at how

333
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:43,850
easy it was um yeah so then I had

334
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:45,590
everything set up with the servo and I'm

335
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:47,180
ready to test the codes working great

336
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:49,850
it's looking good I don't think there's

337
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:52,220
anything wrong with it the cron job that

338
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:53,660
I have in the code which is for the

339
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:56,630
scheduler part you can set it so that it

340
00:14:56,630 --> 00:15:00,830
feeds the cats every like 124 I don't

341
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:02,900
know something divisible by 24 then you

342
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:04,250
can feed the cats on that schedule it

343
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:05,660
was working good because I tested it

344
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:09,110
with seconds before I set it to ours the

345
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:11,060
servo was strong enough to power the

346
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:12,920
feeder which I was and I was like if it

347
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,030
works with a little bit of food is it

348
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:15,770
going to work with a lot of it a lot a

349
00:15:15,770 --> 00:15:18,430
bit of food and it did so that was good

350
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:21,620
except it wouldn't stop so it would just

351
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:25,070
keep on going and all of the food that

352
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:26,540
was in it would just come out and I was

353
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:29,330
like oh that's kind of important I need

354
00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:34,040
this to work and so I freaked out I have

355
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,900
this really bad tendency whenever

356
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:40,090
something goes slightly wrong to try

357
00:15:40,090 --> 00:15:42,500
everything I can to fix it which is

358
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,600
especially bad when I mess up get

359
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:50,080
branches so I I freaked out on Twitter I

360
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:53,330
censored it in case you're offended this

361
00:15:53,330 --> 00:15:55,970
was actually because I had reset the

362
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:58,370
access token to communicate with the

363
00:15:58,370 --> 00:16:00,650
photon and I forgot to update my code it

364
00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:02,180
took me like three hours to realize that

365
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:04,070
because I wasn't reading the whole error

366
00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:05,330
message and I just knew it wasn't

367
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:07,760
working so I was mad so I decided to ask

368
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:10,310
other people to help me there's a really

369
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:12,800
great get er chat for Johnny Five where

370
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,660
there's people there that will help you

371
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:16,520
and people helped me but it didn't

372
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:19,670
really help there's also a Brooklyn jazz

373
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:23,000
node box room which Francis who helps

374
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,599
run

375
00:16:25,609 --> 00:16:29,100
Queens no only Sarah does Queens jesse

376
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:31,559
is working at beaucoup now he does a lot

377
00:16:31,559 --> 00:16:33,720
of no bot stuff he made a room when I

378
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:35,100
was having problems probably so I would

379
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,660
stop asking them on Twitter all the time

380
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:38,879
um people ravine my code and said

381
00:16:38,879 --> 00:16:40,889
nothing was wrong Sue's reviewed my code

382
00:16:40,889 --> 00:16:42,089
and she's like it looks good I don't

383
00:16:42,089 --> 00:16:44,160
know what's happening and I was like so

384
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,989
what is happening why is it wrong and

385
00:16:45,989 --> 00:16:51,079
then something awesome happens um after

386
00:16:51,079 --> 00:16:54,689
Rick told me to stop buying shitty

387
00:16:54,689 --> 00:16:59,609
servos he went this is Rick Waldron the

388
00:16:59,609 --> 00:17:02,069
guy that made Johnny 5 he went to the

389
00:17:02,069 --> 00:17:04,199
store that i bought my shitty servo from

390
00:17:04,199 --> 00:17:06,389
bought the same one and realizes it was

391
00:17:06,389 --> 00:17:13,110
a bug in his library so I tweeted this

392
00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:15,630
the code for my automated feeder is done

393
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:17,370
if I didn't already have a cat named

394
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:19,350
Rick I'd named the next one after Rick

395
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:22,199
Waldron and he gave me the credit for

396
00:17:22,199 --> 00:17:25,769
finding the bug when I didn't I guess I

397
00:17:25,769 --> 00:17:28,289
did I I guess I found it even though I

398
00:17:28,289 --> 00:17:29,519
didn't realize it cuz i don't know i

399
00:17:29,519 --> 00:17:30,929
still don't know anything about hardware

400
00:17:30,929 --> 00:17:33,299
i just try and plug things in and it

401
00:17:33,299 --> 00:17:35,460
works so that was really great because

402
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:38,789
what ended up happening is servos have

403
00:17:38,789 --> 00:17:42,169
this thing called a dead bands and

404
00:17:42,169 --> 00:17:44,460
sometimes you need to adjust them with a

405
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:46,620
trim pot which is like a hole in the

406
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:49,169
side that has a screw if it has a trim

407
00:17:49,169 --> 00:17:52,049
pot mine didn't I had to take the whole

408
00:17:52,049 --> 00:17:55,080
thing apart and there's one inside so

409
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:56,970
you turn it until it stops when it's

410
00:17:56,970 --> 00:18:00,029
going and the code in Johnny Five that

411
00:18:00,029 --> 00:18:02,220
you can set a dead band in wasn't

412
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:04,649
implemented into the Sox top coat for

413
00:18:04,649 --> 00:18:06,389
the servo so even if I had everything

414
00:18:06,389 --> 00:18:08,039
right it was never stopped it would have

415
00:18:08,039 --> 00:18:09,929
kept on going but it's fixed now so

416
00:18:09,929 --> 00:18:12,330
that's good I'll show you the code

417
00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:15,980
really quick I made sure I took out my

418
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:20,880
access tokens so this code to is not how

419
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,720
it's like on the actual repo anymore

420
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:26,610
it's just typical I'll scroll I'm not

421
00:18:26,610 --> 00:18:27,659
going to go through every line you set

422
00:18:27,659 --> 00:18:29,519
up your server you out all your things

423
00:18:29,519 --> 00:18:31,950
this is the code for Johnny Five to set

424
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:35,370
up a board you've got the function that

425
00:18:35,370 --> 00:18:37,049
is making your Kron strings

426
00:18:37,049 --> 00:18:38,789
for however you want it to feed it and

427
00:18:38,789 --> 00:18:41,489
then the boards ready there's a servo if

428
00:18:41,489 --> 00:18:43,110
you've got the listener for the board

429
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:45,389
connection and the web connection and

430
00:18:45,389 --> 00:18:48,419
then you've got the feeding event so it

431
00:18:48,419 --> 00:18:50,730
feeds the cat and that's great and then

432
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:53,879
there's also an event for the cron job

433
00:18:53,879 --> 00:18:56,639
it's really simple code and then the

434
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:59,489
client code before I added routing was

435
00:18:59,489 --> 00:19:03,960
just a button and a drop-down and now

436
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,669
this is what it looks like so basically

437
00:19:05,669 --> 00:19:08,700
what happens is you hit feed me

438
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:10,440
immediately and it dispenses the food

439
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,779
which I'll show you really quick can you

440
00:19:12,779 --> 00:19:23,279
switch the on button on me so I have it

441
00:19:23,279 --> 00:19:28,379
here watch it not work I will cry you

442
00:19:28,379 --> 00:19:34,080
push the button and it doesn't work okay

443
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,210
well it would it's not important i'll

444
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:39,960
show you later and then the casket food

445
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:45,059
it's great so you're almost ready to

446
00:19:45,059 --> 00:19:48,359
open source I put a call on Twitter for

447
00:19:48,359 --> 00:19:50,820
people to review my code and the

448
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:52,980
response was so good so many people

449
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:57,059
helped a lot um they refactored it so

450
00:19:57,059 --> 00:20:01,970
that had happy um Jacob where are you

451
00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:05,340
here somewhere oh there he helped fix my

452
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:07,259
code to it was really cool i was so

453
00:20:07,259 --> 00:20:10,559
happy so they did all that Ashley made

454
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:13,049
Ashley Williams made it into a mpm

455
00:20:13,049 --> 00:20:16,619
module um reviewed the readme for

456
00:20:16,619 --> 00:20:18,899
language and they liked it it was great

457
00:20:18,899 --> 00:20:21,480
my cats liked it too it worked they ate

458
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:25,559
it I got a really good jiff don't get

459
00:20:25,559 --> 00:20:27,690
mad at me for saying jiff um I mean

460
00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:29,609
brick likes food so he would have no

461
00:20:29,609 --> 00:20:31,409
matter what but it made for a really

462
00:20:31,409 --> 00:20:33,509
good thing so when I was ready to launch

463
00:20:33,509 --> 00:20:35,879
I changed the repo to public I tweeted

464
00:20:35,879 --> 00:20:37,980
about it I submitted a link to hacker

465
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:41,220
news and then I went to sleep and then

466
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:43,019
when I woke up I don't I wasn't quite

467
00:20:43,019 --> 00:20:44,700
ready for what happened i was on the

468
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:48,179
front page hacker news people retweeted

469
00:20:48,179 --> 00:20:48,990
it and saved

470
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:53,160
it so much there's like over 500 stars

471
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,900
now and github which is really cool and

472
00:20:54,900 --> 00:21:06,540
I'm huge in Japan it was really me um so

473
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:07,770
basically the whole entire project

474
00:21:07,770 --> 00:21:10,650
helped me realize a lot of things don't

475
00:21:10,650 --> 00:21:13,050
be afraid of the unfamiliar because it

476
00:21:13,050 --> 00:21:14,400
doesn't matter if you don't know it cuz

477
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,710
you will when you're done and definitely

478
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:18,570
don't be afraid to ask for help I

479
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:20,040
struggled with this for a really long

480
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:23,100
time I because I didn't want people to

481
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:24,240
assume that i didn't know what i was

482
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,890
doing so i would spend a really long

483
00:21:25,890 --> 00:21:27,960
time trying to bug fix or figure out any

484
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:30,600
problems cuz i just wanted to do it

485
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,640
myself no matter how long it took and

486
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:35,190
now I'm lazy and I don't want to spend a

487
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:36,929
really long time doing stuff so I'll

488
00:21:36,929 --> 00:21:39,059
just ask people to help me out and it

489
00:21:39,059 --> 00:21:41,370
goes a lot quicker um also people really

490
00:21:41,370 --> 00:21:45,090
like cat stuff more than me maybe um

491
00:21:45,090 --> 00:21:48,150
also don't downplay your abilities uh

492
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:50,460
when I was almost done with the project

493
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:52,320
whenever I would tell people about it I

494
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:55,020
would be like it's not that impressive

495
00:21:55,020 --> 00:22:00,240
but and I dusted who's right there would

496
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,520
they stop telling people that it's not

497
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:04,200
that impressive like just tell them

498
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:07,410
about it because it's cool also I like

499
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:09,290
note blocks a lot it's really fun it's

500
00:22:09,290 --> 00:22:12,240
relatively easy even though it's kind of

501
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,830
stressful like when things don't work

502
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:17,309
when you're supposed to demo them yeah

503
00:22:17,309 --> 00:22:19,020
it was it was really fun I'm going to

504
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:24,160
try and get it to work really quick okay

505
00:22:24,170 --> 00:22:28,530
good you can't see my terminal oh wait

506
00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:30,780
that's okay it disconnected i think that

507
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:36,270
makes sense okay we're up it's on are

508
00:22:36,270 --> 00:22:40,260
you sure that the switch is on on is it

509
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:44,820
breathing okay great maybe it'll work

510
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:55,580
now okay oh you know what I wonder

511
00:22:55,590 --> 00:23:02,559
I spent like twenty dollars on eight

512
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:04,809
bags of M&MS so I'm just going to keep

513
00:23:04,809 --> 00:23:08,950
on pushing this please go eat some candy

514
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:12,330
if you want it because one more time

515
00:23:12,330 --> 00:23:25,239
okay the last thing that I wanted to

516
00:23:25,239 --> 00:23:29,589
talk about is trying to get this full

517
00:23:29,589 --> 00:23:35,789
screen okay is my history with jazz comp

518
00:23:35,789 --> 00:23:41,169
my first j/s comp was last summer so may

519
00:23:41,169 --> 00:23:44,919
2014 I didn't know anybody here's a

520
00:23:44,919 --> 00:23:48,460
picture of Tom Dale throwing a ball at a

521
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:51,099
dunk tank and there's me standing in the

522
00:23:51,099 --> 00:23:54,940
background by myself watching because I

523
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:58,570
didn't know anyone this was the dunk

524
00:23:58,570 --> 00:23:59,919
tank if you weren't there it was great I

525
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:02,769
actually dunked everyone besides Tom and

526
00:24:02,769 --> 00:24:04,450
I think that's the only reason that like

527
00:24:04,450 --> 00:24:06,429
Chris remembered who I was the next time

528
00:24:06,429 --> 00:24:10,149
he saw me because I seriously I'm really

529
00:24:10,149 --> 00:24:14,349
good at dunk tanks so I didn't really

530
00:24:14,349 --> 00:24:16,119
know anybody besides the few co-workers

531
00:24:16,119 --> 00:24:19,539
that I had and so I just would drink and

532
00:24:19,539 --> 00:24:21,219
go in the pool every night by myself and

533
00:24:21,219 --> 00:24:24,429
that's where I met this guy um he was

534
00:24:24,429 --> 00:24:26,859
like you live in Brooklyn that's cool I

535
00:24:26,859 --> 00:24:28,299
live in Brooklyn there's this really

536
00:24:28,299 --> 00:24:30,190
great thing called Brooklyn jas you

537
00:24:30,190 --> 00:24:33,519
should totally come and I did and um the

538
00:24:33,519 --> 00:24:36,119
first Brooklyn jf said I went to I met a

539
00:24:36,119 --> 00:24:39,279
lot of people I became friends with

540
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:42,039
Jennifer who now you can thank that for

541
00:24:42,039 --> 00:24:48,590
horrible moments like this um and

542
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:53,230
she invited me to da HTML comp which is

543
00:24:53,230 --> 00:24:55,029
a part of jazz fest in oakland where i

544
00:24:55,029 --> 00:24:57,460
got my first speaking opportunity that

545
00:24:57,460 --> 00:25:01,000
was a satirical talk about me being kind

546
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,620
of a big deal on the internet which was

547
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:05,710
basically history of all the bad things

548
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:08,080
that I've done on the internet since I

549
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,669
started building websites when I was

550
00:25:09,669 --> 00:25:14,470
like 14 and then my first borough meetup

551
00:25:14,470 --> 00:25:19,450
talk Jed close your eyes I Manhattan

552
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:21,039
jeaious is this really cool thing where

553
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:23,080
it's three technical talks and then a

554
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:27,190
passion talk which is I'm sorry I'll

555
00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:31,840
just I'll go back um and I do special

556
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,669
effects makeup as a hobby it's really

557
00:25:33,669 --> 00:25:36,100
fun and I like fake blood a lot and so I

558
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:39,669
made will Duffy look like he had a half

559
00:25:39,669 --> 00:25:42,220
of a cut on a space so I met all these

560
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:45,220
great people and they really encouraged

561
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:48,970
me to be more comfortable with myself as

562
00:25:48,970 --> 00:25:51,190
a developer and not be afraid to do

563
00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:54,159
things so when it came to Jas comp this

564
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:58,960
summer it was vastly different I wasn't

565
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,789
staying to myself I was in a much better

566
00:26:00,789 --> 00:26:03,850
mood I wasn't afraid to try stuff I

567
00:26:03,850 --> 00:26:06,760
actually got to do things like I went to

568
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:08,500
the node BOTS thing and I built a robot

569
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:12,279
it was me it was really fun um I also

570
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:14,140
had to put this up there because I don't

571
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:15,610
think I'll ever forget anything about

572
00:26:15,610 --> 00:26:19,600
lithium polymer batteries um but the

573
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,070
coolest thing that happened over the

574
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:23,230
summer was because of Jess calm I got a

575
00:26:23,230 --> 00:26:27,250
job and I had my first interview in the

576
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:28,990
hot tub and I know that sounds horrible

577
00:26:28,990 --> 00:26:31,029
but there was like 20 people in the hot

578
00:26:31,029 --> 00:26:34,920
tub that

579
00:26:34,930 --> 00:26:41,240
it was it was cool it was fine no code

580
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:43,280
of conduct was violated I just had an

581
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:47,690
interview in the flesh though Evan here

582
00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:49,880
you know talking to all of you and then

583
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:51,500
on Monday I have to go to Portland and

584
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:53,750
talk about it again and it's

585
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:55,970
overwhelming but I don't think that I

586
00:26:55,970 --> 00:26:58,100
would have done any of the things that I

587
00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:01,070
have done in the past year or Matt like

588
00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:02,750
half the people that I've met and became

589
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:05,270
friends with if it wasn't for Jas comp
