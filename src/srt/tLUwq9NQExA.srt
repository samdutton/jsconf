1
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:12,840
Hi.

2
00:00:12,849 --> 00:00:13,849
My name is Hannes.

3
00:00:13,849 --> 00:00:16,670
I'm here to talk about web Development in
China.

4
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:19,990
I have been doing web development since 2004.

5
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:25,720
If anybody remember this is.

6
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:32,809
I got bored of being in Hamburg and in Germany,
so in 2011 I ended up in China as a web developer.

7
00:00:32,809 --> 00:00:36,210
And that was not completely my expression,
but it was a little bit my expression.

8
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:38,899
That's a screaming legal person there.

9
00:00:38,899 --> 00:00:42,360
I felt like going back into the past a little
bit.

10
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:48,850
Because in 2011 when I arrived in China, I
had to deal with supporting IE6 again.

11
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:53,199
This is a world web of IE6 in 2011.

12
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:56,719
And you see this stop there I zoom this in
a little bit.

13
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:59,429
This is China with over like 30%.

14
00:00:59,429 --> 00:01:05,159
So, I was already supporting IE6, if not many
more, and then I was right back supporting

15
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:06,159
IE6.

16
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:07,220
That was not great.

17
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:12,770
So, in the last several years, all of this
changed.

18
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:18,130
Now everybody is using a mobile phone pretty
much all the time.

19
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:23,540
And maybe you feel more comfortable booking
a flight ticket on a desk desktop or a laptop,

20
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:24,770
that's what I do.

21
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:30,619
In China, they do everything except work,
maybe, the majority does everything on the

22
00:01:30,619 --> 00:01:31,619
mobile phone.

23
00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:35,920
So, they're highly mobile optimized.

24
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,600
How does this happen that people actually
skipped computers?

25
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,960
It's the leapfrog effect.

26
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:45,430
The majority of people had cell phones.

27
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:52,009
And a generation skipped from a cell phone
over the desktop to having a computer in their

28
00:01:52,009 --> 00:01:53,009
hand.

29
00:01:53,009 --> 00:01:54,009
Having a smartphone.

30
00:01:54,009 --> 00:01:57,960
So, a lot of people, the majority of people,
actually, never had a desktop at home.

31
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,110
They just had the smartphone.

32
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:03,900
This is why most people always use the smartphone
by now.

33
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:07,689
Before going to the talk, an overview of what
to talk about.

34
00:02:07,689 --> 00:02:08,840
The three topics.

35
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:11,220
The mandatory part.

36
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:16,560
If you do projects for people in China, what
you need to take care of.

37
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:21,910
I talk about the important part, WeChat, the
number one social media app in China.

38
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:25,670
And I talk about the development ecosystem,
the community part in China.

39
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:31,000
I think this is the most interesting part.

40
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,040
I would like to know here in the audience,
who has been to China?

41
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,370
Okay.

42
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:37,710
Not too many people, actually.

43
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:42,320
So, for the people who have not been to China,
I'm going to pick you up there.

44
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:45,140
So, you've heard that stuff is blocked in
China, right?

45
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:47,530
Facebook, Tweeter, Google stuff is blocked.

46
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:48,600
But you don't know what that means.

47
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:55,240
Usually on a new country, you flip out your
phone and ask Google how to get to the hotel.

48
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:58,170
If you do that in China, this is how it looks.

49
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:02,150
You get the familiar blue spot, but nothing
else.

50
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:04,440
Google won't talk to you.

51
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,730
And even though you thought you would be prepared.

52
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:10,590
You might figure out, okay, maybe not that
prepared anymore.

53
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:15,010
Other people come to China a little bit more
prepared, like Mark Zuckerberg.

54
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:21,100
He runs over Tiananmen Square in Beijing and
was able to post it on Facebook so other people

55
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:24,510
come to China better prepared.

56
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:27,640
And now that you have an idea of how it feels
to be a tourist in China, I would like to

57
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:34,420
talk about the first project in China, the
project for people or users in China.

58
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:41,010
If your client tells you, hey, whack we do
soc that people in China can use our web page?

59
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:44,720
First of all, you might add translations.

60
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,070
Maybe webfonts on that page.

61
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:53,620
I have a client, they have print products
and we have a special one for Chinese characters.

62
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:55,680
Sending over here.

63
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,250
Having fonts for special Chinese characters
that we use for printing products.

64
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:03,610
Maybe we can transform that file and you can
use it on the Internet.

65
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:05,840
And I said, yes, that's a great idea.

66
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:06,920
Send it over.

67
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:10,720
They sent over a file and it was 50 megabyte.

68
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,260
Maybe not a good idea.

69
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:13,890
Chinese has a lot of characters, obviously.

70
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:17,290
So, they said, put it in anyway.

71
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:18,880
And I was like, maybe not.

72
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:23,510
So, the idea is, just use system fonts with
Chinese on your web page.

73
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:28,480
If you want to use a web font, make sure that
it's highly optimized.

74
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:33,860
Another thing is people like to have maps
on the page to show fancy things.

75
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:36,590
Usually they use Google Maps to implement
that.

76
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:40,160
And this is the company, we have branches
all over the world.

77
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,380
This is how it looks.

78
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:42,590
In China, it looks like this.

79
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:44,870
You don't see anything.

80
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:50,060
If you want to make sure that you have a map
and the Chinese audience can see it, you might

81
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:51,830
want to use alternatives to Google Maps.

82
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:54,470
For example, Mapbox still works.

83
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:57,180
Anyone from Mapbox in here?

84
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:58,880
Okay.

85
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:02,240
And maybe the better alternative is using
the Chinese provider.

86
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,090
In this case, Baidu maps.

87
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:06,050
This is reliable within China.

88
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:14,380
You have to have the Chinese translation,
but you can copy and paste code.

89
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:15,850
You sell stuff on your web page.

90
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:22,000
And why are none of the Chinese users now
that we translated stuff are buying stuff?

91
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:28,290
That's because you ask for western payment
that are not popular in China pretty much

92
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:29,290
at all.

93
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:30,290
Nobody is using these.

94
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:33,010
Maybe some, but obviously not the majority.

95
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:34,290
What do they use?

96
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:39,820
In real life, you see lines in shops and restaurants,
online, everywhere.

97
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:42,070
These three payment methods here.

98
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:48,810
If you want people from China not to be hesitant
to buy stuff on your page, implement at least

99
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:51,100
one of these on your page.

100
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:57,470
It's not that bad if you already use a payment
integration service like Stripe or Wirecard,

101
00:05:57,470 --> 00:06:02,640
they offer one of these payment methods that
you can easily integrate.

102
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:07,100
And generally there is something hm.

103
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:08,100
Okay.

104
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:11,230
In general, it's always like a good idea to
hold stuff yourself.

105
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:16,550
If you use CDNs, content delivery networks
or web providers, make sure they're not blocked

106
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:17,550
in China.

107
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:20,490
And make that sure on a regular basis.

108
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:22,920
You never know when things are changing.

109
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:27,530
Maybe it's a better idea to host stuff in
general on your own server.

110
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:32,840
Then how to improve performance?

111
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:33,940
You can host in China.

112
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:37,389
It's going to be faster to load for the Chinese
users.

113
00:06:37,389 --> 00:06:42,033
Well, in China, hosting is a little bit different.

114
00:06:42,033 --> 00:06:44,940
Maybe you have seen the web page that has
the small numbers down here.

115
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:46,050
Zoom this in a little bit.

116
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:47,780
It says ICP.

117
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:48,780
Maybe you can't read it.

118
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:50,600
It says ICP, & there's a number.

119
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:57,740
It's Internet content provider and there's
basically somehow a number plate of your web

120
00:06:57,740 --> 00:06:58,740
page.

121
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:02,350
So, it indicates who is responsible for the
content of your web page.

122
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:08,350
And, yes, if there's any issue, for example,
that happened to other people that I know,

123
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:12,320
you have a country selector and you list all
the countries in the world, including Hong

124
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:16,930
Kong and Taiwan, someone is going to call
you and say, please change that.

125
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:19,700
Otherwise we're going to block your page.

126
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:22,670
How to get this Internet content providing
number?

127
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:24,510
Well, you need a company in China.

128
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:29,750
You need an entity of a company in China or
a corporation partner that helps you with

129
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:34,130
applying to this doing this process of applying
for an ICP number.

130
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:36,350
And once you have done that, it takes a longer
time.

131
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:38,330
Maybe up to six, eight weeks.

132
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:42,110
Then you can legally host in China.

133
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:43,419
And that was my first topic already.

134
00:07:43,419 --> 00:07:49,050
It was to talk about don't use web fonts for
Chinese, unless they're optimized, no Google

135
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:53,580
Maps, offer Chinese payment methods, host
for yourself and be if you want to host in

136
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:55,910
China, get a license.

137
00:07:55,910 --> 00:08:01,610
And the next topic is WeChat.

138
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:03,050
Maybe you have heard of WeChat.

139
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:07,020
Maybe people told you it's like the WhatsApp
of China.

140
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:11,430
Maybe that was the case, but now it's changed.

141
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:19,139
And you use the different apps to do all kinds
of things on our mobile devices.

142
00:08:19,139 --> 00:08:24,860
By now you could say that the majority of
these things or all these things can be done

143
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:27,560
in China by only using WeChat.

144
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:34,520
WeChat is created by a company called Tencent
and integrated into Chinese society.

145
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,320
How it's integrated into daily life.

146
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:39,440
I would like to show in real life examples.

147
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:43,050
Here is a QR code in the restaurant.

148
00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:49,589
I open the WeChat, scan the QR code and I
can order food and pay, and it gets delivered

149
00:08:49,589 --> 00:08:52,820
to my table.

150
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:55,320
I order coffee here with WeChat.

151
00:08:55,320 --> 00:09:00,600
Here, these are like QR codes that you see
everywhere in restaurants that you use for

152
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,820
scanning and payment.

153
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:04,430
This is me doing this.

154
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:08,330
Scanning one of these QR codes and then paying
with WeChat.

155
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:12,120
You can also use that for street venders selling
foods or things on the street.

156
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:16,080
They're going to show a QR code and you can
pay with WeChat.

157
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,960
Basically, most of the Chinese people, or
maybe just, yeah.

158
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:23,420
Most of the Chinese people, they don't take
cash anymore.

159
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:29,350
They just need their phone and you go out
and you can do everything with your phone.

160
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:32,240
You can also rent bikes with it.

161
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,830
Maybe you have seen these bikes also in Berlin.

162
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:40,300
And you know that you have they already have
their own native apps to rent a bike here,

163
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:41,300
right?

164
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:45,790
But these are also, these functionalities,
are also integrated into WeChat.

165
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:52,040
Once you have WeChat and you can rent all
these bikes, you don't need the native app

166
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,470
anymore.

167
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:57,620
You can also do hospital appointments with
WeChat.

168
00:09:57,620 --> 00:10:01,540
And the last thing that I figured out, apparently
you can get a divorce with WeChat.

169
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:03,220
[ Laughter ]
So, yeah.

170
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:08,210
You can do a lot of things with WeChat.

171
00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:09,930
And yeah.

172
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:11,670
To give you an idea of how this works.

173
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:17,120
Inside of WeChat, apart from the chat application,
I want to introduce how it looks like.

174
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,370
For example, here you have the mobile top
up thingy.

175
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:23,070
If you run out of data, you can top up your
data plan there.

176
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:25,270
There's something called utilities.

177
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:26,630
You get an overview.

178
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:27,630
It's Chinese here.

179
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:31,440
But it's an overview of your utility bills,
electricity, water, et cetera.

180
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,270
You can pay all of this with WeChat.

181
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:35,370
And there's another thing.

182
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:37,140
It's like third party operators.

183
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:41,440
These are being this is a default that comes
with WeChat.

184
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:47,750
You can buy flight tickets, order, get movie
tickets we buy food, et cetera, et cetera.

185
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:53,060
And usually all these services have their
own native apps, but once you can use this,

186
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:56,560
why would you install the native app, right?

187
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:03,480
So, when we talk mobile first, I talk to some
Chinese development friends and they said,

188
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:05,450
well in in WeChat?

189
00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:09,399
In China you could talk about WeChat first.

190
00:11:09,399 --> 00:11:12,490
Because you need to make sure that your stuff
it not working on the Safari browser.

191
00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:16,120
It has to work inside of WeChat.

192
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:18,990
And you can also extend that functionality.

193
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:24,400
And before this was done by creating HTML
5 pages that will be opened in the internal

194
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:29,040
browser of WeChat and you can use an SDK and
do payment and do the QR code scanning and

195
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,620
stuff.

196
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:32,779
But I think I don't know.

197
00:11:32,779 --> 00:11:38,870
One and a half years or one year ago they
created something called Tencent created WeChat

198
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:40,520
mini programs.

199
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:50,150
And they are basic life a better extension
a better way to extend the WeChat and write

200
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:51,610
your own stuff for WeChat.

201
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:53,940
And I'll give you an example.

202
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:56,730
It's the Chinese Yelp.

203
00:11:56,730 --> 00:11:58,480
And this is the overview of WeChat.

204
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:03,339
And I'm asking for a recommendation for a
Beijing duck restaurant.

205
00:12:03,339 --> 00:12:06,839
And they reply with a link.

206
00:12:06,839 --> 00:12:07,980
And you get a preview.

207
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:13,850
And you click this, and the internal browser
opens and shows the detailed information of

208
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:14,880
the restaurant.

209
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:20,950
In this case, it says on the bottom, it says
mini program.

210
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:27,100
If I click this, not the internal browser
opens, but a loading layer opens for like

211
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:30,540
a second and then I get the information about
the Beijing restaurant.

212
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:34,200
It's a good duck restaurant.

213
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:39,330
And once you have done that and you installed
this mini program into WeChat, you can also

214
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:42,850
place that here on the right on your home
screen.

215
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:51,170
And if you click it here, you get the Chinese
Yelp in the mini chat layer.

216
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:54,430
It has a third party app.

217
00:12:54,430 --> 00:12:58,600
But as I said, once you can do the majority
of things with the program, why would you

218
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:03,010
install to the native app or go to the mobile
site?

219
00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:07,470
You're using WeChat all the time anyway.

220
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:12,149
And you might say how this reminds me of a
PWA.

221
00:13:12,149 --> 00:13:14,310
And, yes, you're right.

222
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:16,149
Because you can use it offline.

223
00:13:16,149 --> 00:13:20,240
You can add it to your home screen and it's
really highly performance optimized and loads

224
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,180
really fast.

225
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:24,280
But in this case, it's a little bit special.

226
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:34,460
So, I call it WeChat apps, by exchanging the
W. It is a little bit special here.

227
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:36,860
Because these things are not hosted on your
own servers.

228
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:40,680
These mini programs are hosted on the Tencent
server, behind WeChat.

229
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:46,790
It's all over the world and delivered and
opened very fast in WeChat.

230
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:52,410
There's an initial size of 1 megabyte.

231
00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:59,690
And it's not 100% web technology.

232
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:04,930
It's web view and native components from WeChat.

233
00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:07,870
Payment and QR code scanning and some other
stuff.

234
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:09,510
Yeah.

235
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:13,090
Tencent, how do you create such a new program?

236
00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:18,500
Tencent decided to create their own JavaScript.

237
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:21,750
It's called WeLang.

238
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:29,459
It's closed source.

239
00:14:29,459 --> 00:14:30,459
It uses WXML.

240
00:14:30,459 --> 00:14:31,940
WSS in JavaScript.

241
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:35,200
It's pretty much HTML and CSS in JavaScript.

242
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,720
They called it differently.

243
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:41,990
And as I said, it compiles into a mix of native
code and others.

244
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:45,470
They created their own enter.

245
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:49,120
This is the preview, this is how you write
code, the debugging.

246
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,160
Looks like the Chrome DevTools.

247
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:56,610
Yes, it's a modified version of the Chrome
Dev Tools I would say.

248
00:14:56,610 --> 00:14:58,510
This is the code for hello world.

249
00:14:58,510 --> 00:14:59,510
It's not big enough.

250
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:07,050
So, I'm going to show you two slides of code
only, so you know how this WeLang looks like

251
00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:09,790
so you're not afraid of using it.

252
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:12,430
This is the WXML.

253
00:15:12,430 --> 00:15:14,010
HTML template.

254
00:15:14,010 --> 00:15:15,010
Maybe people say it looks familiar.

255
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:20,630
It looks a bit like VUE JS.

256
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:24,020
And this is the CSS.

257
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:27,790
And this is the JavaScript part.

258
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:31,250
There's just a data property and I have the
hello world and that's it.

259
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:36,010
And after you load the initial kind of JavaScript,
you can do some other functionalities.

260
00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:38,560
You get user information and stuff and stuff.

261
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:42,770
So, you see it's not like that different.

262
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:47,880
Bootstrap, this is pretty much the bootstrap
of WeChat.

263
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:53,430
They provide some UX elements that you can
use to style it in a way that it looks like

264
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:54,480
WeChat.

265
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,529
Yes.

266
00:15:55,529 --> 00:15:58,350
That was the WeChat part.

267
00:15:58,350 --> 00:15:59,350
What am I talking about?

268
00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:01,700
Talking about WeChat, the number one in China.

269
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:03,740
There are others, but this is the most important.

270
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:12,610
I introduced WeChat and the payment and the
aspects of WeChat in programs.

271
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:14,589
And this brings me to the last part?

272
00:16:14,589 --> 00:16:16,480
How much time do I have left?

273
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,550
Do I have ten minutes?

274
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:20,740
I have two minutes left?

275
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:21,740
Wow.

276
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:22,740
Okay.

277
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:24,269
This is the important part.

278
00:16:24,269 --> 00:16:25,269
Four minutes left.

279
00:16:25,269 --> 00:16:26,269
Okay.

280
00:16:26,269 --> 00:16:27,269
Cool.

281
00:16:27,269 --> 00:16:28,269
This is the interesting part.

282
00:16:28,269 --> 00:16:29,269
The ecosystem.

283
00:16:29,269 --> 00:16:30,269
The community of China.

284
00:16:30,269 --> 00:16:35,360
When I came to China in 2011 I was going to
conferences and meetups and exchanging knowledge.

285
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:38,500
I had the feeling that was not the case in
2011.

286
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:40,660
Not a lot of conferences and meetups.

287
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:46,649
And people stuck to their own knowledge to
keep their place safe in a way.

288
00:16:46,649 --> 00:16:47,829
By now this all changed.

289
00:16:47,829 --> 00:16:49,320
They have their own conference.

290
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:52,050
JavaScript, VUE, React, CSS, et cetera.

291
00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:58,200
They have a lot of meetups in the bigger cities
and they exchange knowledge way more than

292
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,450
before.

293
00:16:59,450 --> 00:17:01,500
They also created their own platforms.

294
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:06,239
Because when we use StackOverflow, we are
comfortable using English more or less.

295
00:17:06,239 --> 00:17:10,860
But for the majority, there are a lot of Chinese
developers that are fluent in English.

296
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:15,990
But the majority, I would say they don't feel
comfortable using English all the time.

297
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:21,000
So, they can use this to search stuff and
copy and paste code as we all do.

298
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:27,169
But once you ask a question here in English,
you can imagine how it works out, so they

299
00:17:27,169 --> 00:17:30,450
created their own StackOverflow.

300
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:33,369
It's green and it's in Chinese.

301
00:17:33,369 --> 00:17:34,539
And it's easier to use, right?

302
00:17:34,539 --> 00:17:35,850
If you're Chinese.

303
00:17:35,850 --> 00:17:37,809
No, but this is not the biggest platform.

304
00:17:37,809 --> 00:17:43,029
I wanted to show this because of the name
and the similarities.

305
00:17:43,029 --> 00:17:49,730
What they actually use is not Quro, but Baidu.

306
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:51,009
This is used to exchange knowledge.

307
00:17:51,009 --> 00:17:57,190
This is the creator of VUE JS, he's Chinese
and has accounts on all the platforms.

308
00:17:57,190 --> 00:17:59,889
Not only western ones, but the Chinese ones.

309
00:17:59,889 --> 00:18:02,480
And, yes, they created open source.

310
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:06,409
You have big companies in China creating open
source.

311
00:18:06,409 --> 00:18:09,859
All of this open source is being done in English.

312
00:18:09,859 --> 00:18:13,070
There's a documentation, communication, issue
handling being done in English.

313
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:17,779
But the Chinese open source is completely
done in Chinese.

314
00:18:17,779 --> 00:18:21,230
And they have to cater for a specific requirement.

315
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:23,200
So, they have to be highly mobile focused.

316
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,830
They really need to scale.

317
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:29,049
Because if you're a startup and become successful
overnight in Germany, maybe add a half million

318
00:18:29,049 --> 00:18:31,299
users.

319
00:18:31,299 --> 00:18:37,210
Successful in China, you can add 50 million
users overnight.

320
00:18:37,210 --> 00:18:42,450
This is interesting for developers inside
and outside of China.

321
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:45,320
So, they want to use this as well.

322
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:49,970
But now we noticed that not only Chinese have
an issue being comfortable in English.

323
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:53,929
But there's an issue of us feeling comfortable
in Chinese.

324
00:18:53,929 --> 00:18:58,510
And in these open source projects, these issues
appear.

325
00:18:58,510 --> 00:19:00,419
Can we have English, please?

326
00:19:00,419 --> 00:19:04,690
Or, documentation and read me should be in
English because, because, because.

327
00:19:04,690 --> 00:19:10,700
And even better, and this is not a native
English speaker, so this is why he doesn't

328
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:12,350
understand what that means.

329
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:14,659
He says, guys, please use English.

330
00:19:14,659 --> 00:19:18,359
And I say this a little bit because there's
a funny answer to this.

331
00:19:18,359 --> 00:19:23,260
The answer says this is the best time to start
learning Mandarin.

332
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:24,260
Maybe it is.

333
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:25,989
Maybe that's the solution.

334
00:19:25,989 --> 00:19:27,399
Learn Mandarin.

335
00:19:27,399 --> 00:19:28,399
Fuck.

336
00:19:28,399 --> 00:19:30,230
This is hard.

337
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:33,860
Maybe not the best option to do that.

338
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:34,860
What can we do?

339
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:39,700
Well, everyone knew we had to figure that
out.

340
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:47,100
Evan You says it lacks in documentation of
learning resources for English speakers.

341
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:49,639
We intend to bridge this gap next year.

342
00:19:49,639 --> 00:19:52,700
That's important to bridge the gap.

343
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:56,210
Not only Chinese and English, but all the
directions.

344
00:19:56,210 --> 00:19:57,210
How do we do this?

345
00:19:57,210 --> 00:20:01,419
Well, we create and this is another Chinese
open source project.

346
00:20:01,419 --> 00:20:04,690
We created a task, document translation.

347
00:20:04,690 --> 00:20:07,389
Looking for volunteers who can help out.

348
00:20:07,389 --> 00:20:12,129
And I think this is so important that we do
this because it doesn't only make it easier

349
00:20:12,129 --> 00:20:17,409
for people from not speaking Chinese to use
your project, for people all over the world.

350
00:20:17,409 --> 00:20:18,639
Developers all over the world to use your
project.

351
00:20:18,639 --> 00:20:24,769
But I think these kinds of tasks are also
a great way with a low entrance barrier to

352
00:20:24,769 --> 00:20:26,669
participate in open source.

353
00:20:26,669 --> 00:20:30,679
Because maybe you don't feel too comfortable
of writing great JavaScript.

354
00:20:30,679 --> 00:20:34,700
But you speak two languages, and this is your
first step into open source.

355
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:40,289
You can start helping to translate stuff and
maybe slowly getting into more of that.

356
00:20:40,289 --> 00:20:42,970
So, I think this is a great thing.

357
00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:45,970
And VUE is doing this really great.

358
00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:47,659
And VUE is very popular in China.

359
00:20:47,659 --> 00:20:51,229
That's maybe because the creator is actually
Chinese.

360
00:20:51,229 --> 00:20:55,460
But also, I think, VUE in general is doing
a great job in documentation and translations.

361
00:20:55,460 --> 00:21:00,539
I read an article because there's a huge community
in China.

362
00:21:00,539 --> 00:21:09,039
But I read an article that there used to be
a big problem of channeling back knowledge

363
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:14,080
from the Chinese community to the American
or the international because of this language

364
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,250
barrier.

365
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:16,499
You don't have this in VUE.

366
00:21:16,499 --> 00:21:22,989
So, I think if this continues, we are just
going to use VUE soon because they do a really

367
00:21:22,989 --> 00:21:23,989
great job on this.

368
00:21:23,989 --> 00:21:25,889
No, it's just a joke.

369
00:21:25,889 --> 00:21:29,640
So, VUE is very popular and I think it's getting
popular all over the world.

370
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:30,640
But yeah.

371
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:35,149
They do a really good job on translation documentation.

372
00:21:35,149 --> 00:21:37,059
And that was the last part we were going to
talk about.

373
00:21:37,059 --> 00:21:41,350
I talked about the shift from not sharing
knowledge to actually sharing knowledge, having

374
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:43,529
conferences, having meetups.

375
00:21:43,529 --> 00:21:47,619
Creating their own platforms to exchange and
share knowledge.

376
00:21:47,619 --> 00:21:50,960
I talked about the language barrier of both
sides.

377
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:56,129
And I said talked about how to enable developers
by providing and even more people by providing

378
00:21:56,129 --> 00:21:59,440
dedicated translation tasks.

379
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,440
And that's it.

380
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:02,919
Thank you very much.

381
00:22:02,919 --> 00:22:06,879
I'm done.

382
00:22:06,879 --> 00:22:10,840
[ Applause ]
Oh.

383
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:17,570
If you if you
[ Applause ]

384
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:18,570
Thanks.

385
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:20,989
If you have any feedback, let me know.
