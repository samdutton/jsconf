00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:18,250

hey guys my stock is going to be

2
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:20,950
involved a new way of making changes to

3
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:23,410
the source code but before I begin let

4
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:26,200
me ask you hi uncle kev have seen the

5
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:28,330
presentation by brad victor in lansing

6
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:33,520
calm principle okay so his I main idea

7
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,350
was about the immediate connection

8
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:37,769
between the source code and the result

9
00:00:37,769 --> 00:00:40,780
let me explain you why is it so

10
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:45,220
important my usual workflow and probably

11
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:47,260
yours is simply the following I make

12
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:49,840
changes to the code I random browser

13
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,450
then I probably had to recreate the

14
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:55,210
state of application and then I look at

15
00:00:55,210 --> 00:00:56,890
the results and compare to what expected

16
00:00:56,890 --> 00:01:00,969
and then I repeat and I repeat even more

17
00:01:00,969 --> 00:01:04,239
times because I cannot always for see

18
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:07,180
and understand what might changes will

19
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:09,820
result for instance if i want to say

20
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:12,130
change the loops or behavioral / button

21
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:15,130
on a web page i usually go to the answer

22
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:16,990
type in some changes then i save the

23
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:19,750
files which the browser refresh then i

24
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:21,400
have to scroll down to the place where

25
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:25,000
button is look at the bottom okay maybe

26
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,770
I have to change something more than I

27
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:28,570
go to the editor type in changing save

28
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:31,170
the file go to the browser refresh

29
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:34,930
scroll down look at and again and again

30
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:37,570
doing it all the day and maybe you're

31
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:40,270
doing the same and there is two problems

32
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:42,009
here actually the first is that I waste

33
00:01:42,009 --> 00:01:44,530
time I keep them keep repeating and

34
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:46,689
repeating the same mechanical actions

35
00:01:46,689 --> 00:01:49,689
all the day and I get tired and the

36
00:01:49,689 --> 00:01:54,310
second is that as i do not have v8 in my

37
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:57,479
mind or sound dumb renderer in my mind i

38
00:01:57,479 --> 00:01:59,770
often do not know what will be the

39
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:03,939
result and this makes my ability to to

40
00:02:03,939 --> 00:02:06,100
create to play the staff to try things

41
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:11,079
to imagine quite limited so his idea was

42
00:02:11,079 --> 00:02:14,769
that you make changes and you see the

43
00:02:14,769 --> 00:02:16,840
result immediately at the same moment

44
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:20,950
you make this change and let's look how

45
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:25,090
it works in a real life now so here i

46
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:28,569
have my webstorm 5 running have anybody

47
00:02:28,569 --> 00:02:29,120
heard about

48
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:35,060
that storm cool so this is an ID for web

49
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:37,040
development a lot of cool features nice

50
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:40,330
application and my project is a simple

51
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:43,250
static page that I have stolen stolen

52
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:46,299
from jetbrains website so there is a an

53
00:02:46,299 --> 00:02:51,110
html5 can you see the code should I make

54
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:55,819
it bigger okay and there are some links

55
00:02:55,819 --> 00:02:59,209
to the style sheets and so on and this

56
00:02:59,209 --> 00:03:03,680
is how it looks like in the browser in

57
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,519
Chrome so this is nice page with some

58
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:09,920
books on shelves you know let me put it

59
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:14,180
to the right so since this page is mine

60
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:25,550
now let me change it so for instance

61
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:28,860
I wanted to change the title like at sab

62
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:33,870
curious bookshelf and you see that page

63
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:36,840
is updated instantly it is not refreshed

64
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:39,390
instead webstorm replaces the

65
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:41,160
corresponding Dom element while i am

66
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:48,780
typing to prove that let me do the same

67
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:56,090
with the tooltip you see this tool tip

68
00:03:56,090 --> 00:04:03,090
if i scroll down and so I'd like to

69
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:10,049
something like URL with no page refresh

70
00:04:10,049 --> 00:04:18,000
you know it's just the beginning if i go

71
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:24,870
to CSS and lets me for instance change

72
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:42,420
the color

73
00:04:42,430 --> 00:05:02,050
or a wrong one sorry

74
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:05,150
you see the color changes the same way I

75
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:23,640
change it on the left

76
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:28,240
the same for backgrounds I can even use

77
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:31,270
a color picker to pick up any color on

78
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:39,600
the screen like this the same is for

79
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,889
four phones which phone would you like

80
00:05:43,889 --> 00:05:47,970
more this one or this one or this one

81
00:05:47,970 --> 00:06:00,210
haha okay next time if i want to say

82
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:11,040
give more space between the books

83
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:20,379
I can do it here this way or I can

84
00:06:20,379 --> 00:06:29,800
basically use the slider

85
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:42,110
anybody likes it this man or I can make

86
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:51,530
the Dukes dance hey cool but this is a

87
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:54,169
another CSS conference not an HTML

88
00:06:54,169 --> 00:06:55,730
conference is a JavaScript conference

89
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:57,770
right guess what will happen with

90
00:06:57,770 --> 00:07:01,250
JavaScript let me add some more

91
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:04,280
animation to my to my web page lets me

92
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:07,010
draw a clock clock is going to be a

93
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:11,690
simple circle with with just a line for

94
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:15,470
the hand so let me create a canvas the

95
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:22,740
bottom

96
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:28,660
in some ways and height like this is

97
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:31,030
going to appear somewhere below the

98
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:48,119
books and let them create a new CSS file

99
00:07:48,129 --> 00:07:53,909
like this so first let me register a

100
00:07:53,909 --> 00:08:01,260
handler

101
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:09,660
which will initialize the time

102
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:12,820
like this and install a function that

103
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:26,110
will draw the clock yes sure like 10

104
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:34,240
times a second around place

105
00:08:34,250 --> 00:09:02,100
so usual stuff like

106
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:17,840
okay so first I need to clear my context

107
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:22,430
like this then I need to draw a circle

108
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:28,240
so it's going to be context in path

109
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:31,889
stroke and in between I want to say

110
00:09:31,889 --> 00:09:40,620
context arc

111
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:47,430
what's to remember

112
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,860
like this there is not nothing on the

113
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:53,560
screen and the problem is that this

114
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,890
unload handler has already been executed

115
00:09:55,890 --> 00:10:01,630
so here I have to refresh my page okay

116
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:04,470
something is wrong this is probably the

117
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:34,900
center so i need to say cameras

118
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:41,060
cool if i want to say make this circle

119
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:50,910
nortek I the line width equals 25 oops

120
00:10:50,920 --> 00:11:33,280
should be working let me try again

121
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:37,220
in just a moment guys we are all

122
00:11:37,220 --> 00:12:01,790
developers you know

123
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:06,300
okay anyway it was supposed to be

124
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:29,519
working maybe i will try something else

125
00:12:29,529 --> 00:12:33,249
let me try to draw these hands for the

126
00:12:33,249 --> 00:13:08,019
clock

127
00:13:08,029 --> 00:13:11,670
okay I give up don't want to waste your

128
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:42,550
time I'm sorry

129
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:49,700
oh thanks thanks guys you got a free

130
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:57,080
license for the next version yeah so I

131
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:59,180
can basically control the thickness of

132
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:02,810
the line instantly because Webster knows

133
00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:04,820
how to replace that function that I

134
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:13,460
change so now now I can play with my

135
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:17,480
code like change their change any number

136
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:25,279
any parameter that I want you see this

137
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:27,830
line changes while I'm changing the

138
00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:29,990
source code and this is the direct

139
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:31,760
change the source code not that

140
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,589
effective dome or sound with something

141
00:14:33,589 --> 00:14:36,230
so they're both changes the source code

142
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:38,690
that code that you keep in your version

143
00:14:38,690 --> 00:14:41,540
control and the code that the state of

144
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:46,190
the browser and so to wrap up I would

145
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:48,260
say that immediate connection exists

146
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:49,820
using webstorm you can have this

147
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:52,580
immediate connection to HTML to CSS

148
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:56,210
property beads color or margin or

149
00:14:56,210 --> 00:15:01,220
whatever and JavaScript as well and you

150
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:03,800
can try this immediate connection right

151
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:06,890
now and I hope it will help you you just

152
00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:10,010
can download a trial version of webstorm

153
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:14,060
for free and it's there if you have any

154
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:15,890
questions you can reach me by email or

155
00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:26,650
ping me on Twitter thanks

156
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:35,100
does does anyone have any questions yeah

157
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:42,870
good in front

158
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:45,860
when you replace Dom nodes according to

159
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:48,680
the HTML you've changed do you exchange

160
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:50,240
everything or just the thing you've

161
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,580
changed oh no only the part that changed

162
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:56,080
and how do you figure out what is what

163
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:59,240
there are some code for that so

164
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:06,560
sometimes it's tricky Thanks so is that

165
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,190
support like trance piling from

166
00:16:09,190 --> 00:16:12,440
coffeescript oh no not right now it's on

167
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:15,800
the plan okay right now we we can work

168
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:19,000
with static files like CSS and HTML and

169
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,920
CSS and less and all this all this

170
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:28,399
compelling are on the plum so so one of

171
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:29,720
the limitations from what you're showing

172
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:32,720
was the the window download thing um are

173
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,399
there other ones like that there is is

174
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:35,570
that like the only thing general

175
00:16:35,570 --> 00:16:38,570
limitation is that if a function or

176
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:40,070
JavaScript code has been already

177
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:42,430
executed at the moment you change it is

178
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:49,209
gone on the next execution it's it's new

179
00:16:49,209 --> 00:16:52,100
so we do not replay that the best

180
00:16:52,100 --> 00:17:02,440
actions it does make much sense

181
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:04,560
actually have a question could you show

182
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:08,480
the refactoring support inside Webster

183
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:12,510
what kind of some kind of yeah for jobs

184
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:20,790
you introduce varietal is there not make

185
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:25,020
much sense right here extract method is

186
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:36,030
there or in line rename of course I

187
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:40,320
cannot remain turning this one but this

188
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:54,200
one will do named

189
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:59,970
there's actually many more cool okay one

190
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:06,460
more question

191
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:12,120
it's will work yes

192
00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:15,250
the question was if I change a name in

193
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:18,420
one file with the other files be updated

194
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:21,880
after some cases where you don't know if

195
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,470
that function is used in the other

196
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:28,960
problem like if if ID is not sure about

197
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:31,600
whether is used or not it will suggest

198
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:34,090
you to review the occurrences that you

199
00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:36,940
can manually include them or exclude

200
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:38,830
down for instance if you reference the

201
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:42,550
function by just a string literal its do

202
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:44,850
one of the cases when I d is not sure

203
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:50,170
what do you mean cool I think that's it
