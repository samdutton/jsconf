00:00:08,269 --> 00:00:12,269
hello let's break here

3
00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:14,730
I think if you're investing time in an

4
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:15,780
open-source project

5
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:17,699
you shouldn't be obliged to also invest

6
00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:20,430
money in showcasing it so I want to show

7
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:23,100
you some services you can use to yeah

8
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:26,720
going live to go live on a budget and

9
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:29,429
I'm also on a mission here I want you to

10
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:32,009
consider stop using github pages because

11
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:36,180
the feature set isn't that great and you

12
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:37,829
check in artifacts in your version

13
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:39,690
control system which is kind of strange

14
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:42,239
and there are better services out there

15
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:45,510
and in my opinion the best one is net if

16
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:49,770
I calm it gives you yeah a custom domain

17
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:52,260
for free or you can have a custom domain

18
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:55,559
with certificate for free you have

19
00:00:55,559 --> 00:00:57,120
really good continuous deployment

20
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:02,539
integration even worse like Thomas 5 for

21
00:01:02,539 --> 00:01:07,890
configuration for CDN and it's really

22
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:09,510
nice you have a preview for every

23
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:12,420
request you have you do it offers also

24
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:14,369
cloud functions and user management with

25
00:01:14,369 --> 00:01:17,250
a free tier and yeah if you have a

26
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:18,540
node.js project

27
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:21,780
I recommend leech calm it's a little bit

28
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:23,310
like code pants so it has a nice

29
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:26,040
community around it and yeah I can have

30
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,110
a full-blown node.js application in the

31
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:30,119
browser on a glitch comm sub domain

32
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:33,479
which is really nice and yeah it also

33
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:37,619
has a editor if you have some difference

34
00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:40,409
of a side project for example go I can

35
00:01:40,409 --> 00:01:42,090
highly recommend our sides by this

36
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:46,320
company called site but to mix with the

37
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:51,000
newspaper it's great also for hosting a

38
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,770
static site you can have an author as

39
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:55,200
product there too and if you provided

40
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,020
akka fire they will start the docker

41
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:02,130
container whatever is inside and PS even

42
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:04,530
on glitch comm you can start a go server

43
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:08,610
when you define the NPM start in the

44
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:11,550
package Jason to like go whatever your

45
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:14,370
main go faster

46
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:17,099
so yeah if you have a open source

47
00:02:17,099 --> 00:02:18,989
project shock hazard

48
00:02:18,989 --> 00:02:21,150
they are great towards out there they

49
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:23,010
deserve your money and if you want to

50
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:26,099
pay you're invited to do so but if you

51
00:02:26,099 --> 00:02:28,500
don't want to if you don't can I think

52
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,900
you don't you shouldn't be obliged to do

53
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:38,590
so yeah please
