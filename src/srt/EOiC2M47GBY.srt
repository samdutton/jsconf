1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:05,339

okay now again hi and first of all thank

2
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:07,170
you for having me and thank you all for

3
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:09,660
being here my name is Manuel Matosevic

4
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:12,030
and I'm a freelance front-end developer

5
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:14,610
from Vienna the slides are already

6
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:16,230
online so you can check them out and

7
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:18,390
follow and log on your laptop if you

8
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:22,590
want to write I'm a way to put a badge

9
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:24,539
that was working on some JavaScript

10
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:26,400
stuff or you know actually I wasn't

11
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:27,990
working it was doing it just for fun

12
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:29,760
because I like to spend some of my free

13
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,590
time doing web stuff who else does that

14
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:33,510
who spends free time doing web stuff

15
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:34,500
yeah

16
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,559
some of us because we all love our job

17
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:39,840
or at least I do and I still love it

18
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,250
even though I'm doing this for quite a

19
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:43,230
while now I made my first web site about

20
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:46,110
17 years ago some friends and I were

21
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:47,940
playing an online game and we had a

22
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:49,770
so-called clan and I made the website

23
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:53,309
for his clan and that's the site the

24
00:00:53,309 --> 00:00:56,309
name is in French the name is in French

25
00:00:56,309 --> 00:01:00,570
and the translation is eat your poo we

26
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:02,430
were some badass 13 year olds yeah

27
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:04,769
definitely but our website was pretty

28
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:08,310
cool we had some image buttons and of

29
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:11,100
course a gap gas book and some Paul's I

30
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:13,229
informed users that the size was the

31
00:01:13,229 --> 00:01:14,880
site was optimized for a certain

32
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,060
resolution and of course I had a marquee

33
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:21,220
tag here yeah

34
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:25,290
[Applause]

35
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:27,560
and there was even some custom

36
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:29,660
JavaScript stuff going on a few years

37
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:32,440
later I made my first personal website

38
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:34,580
there is a lot of embarrassing stuff

39
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:36,260
going on I'm not going to go into detail

40
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:38,090
later I even cut some stuff out because

41
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:41,510
it was just too much there are two very

42
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:43,190
interesting things here the first one is

43
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:44,990
one of my favorite favorite movies was

44
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:50,180
the shinning and the second thing is

45
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:52,220
that I didn't use CSS at all in this

46
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:55,310
website I made the layout with so called

47
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:57,229
frame sets some of you may know who them

48
00:01:57,229 --> 00:02:00,170
yeah yeah frame set and I defined three

49
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:03,790
columns using HTML attributes and then I

50
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:08,509
embedded and in each of those columns

51
00:02:08,509 --> 00:02:10,489
separates HTML file one for the

52
00:02:10,489 --> 00:02:12,230
navigation one for the main content and

53
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:15,470
one for a sidebar for the layout of the

54
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:17,570
main content of course I used tables and

55
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:20,239
attributes like border color background

56
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:23,810
color align and I set the width to 442

57
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:34,160
percent it worked and for the global

58
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,680
styles of course I used again HTML

59
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,480
attributes like background color V link

60
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,220
and ailing for active and visited links

61
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:43,190
and the good old fonts tag for font size

62
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:47,120
and font family if I didn't use CSS

63
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,280
because maybe I didn't know about it or

64
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,590
maybe I just didn't need it but a few

65
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:53,989
years later in college I learned CSS and

66
00:02:53,989 --> 00:02:55,880
all the great properties like float

67
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:59,360
position overflow background properties

68
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,310
line height and so on that was amazing

69
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:03,650
and then a few years later again I was

70
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:06,350
introduced to a game changer to CSS free

71
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:07,910
because all of a sudden we had

72
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:10,400
border-radius box shadow animation

73
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,100
transforms web fonts of course and the

74
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:14,720
way the web looked like changed

75
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,400
significantly and it still keeps

76
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,110
changing because browsers are can't

77
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:20,090
constantly shipping great new features

78
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:22,970
like flexbox grids feature queries

79
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:25,190
custom properties amazing stuff to

80
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:28,430
create amazing experiences but you know

81
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:28,850
what

82
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:31,070
spider-man's uncle says with great power

83
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:32,390
comes great responsibility

84
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:33,990
[Laughter]

85
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:39,599
[Applause]

86
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:42,219
and now we also have many tools to

87
00:03:42,219 --> 00:03:44,590
create bad experiences and that's what I

88
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:46,450
want to talk about in the course of the

89
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:48,040
next twenty five minutes I'm going going

90
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,359
to show you some properties that you can

91
00:03:49,359 --> 00:03:51,969
use in order to improve the

92
00:03:51,969 --> 00:03:53,680
accessibility and the user experience of

93
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,750
your sites and some properties that you

94
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:58,450
can misuse in and change the experience

95
00:03:58,450 --> 00:04:00,489
for the worse and I'm going to start

96
00:04:00,489 --> 00:04:04,239
with font size the font size for text

97
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:05,980
was in the last few years somewhere

98
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:09,790
between 14 and 18 pixels that that has

99
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:12,519
changed recently and we can see more and

100
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:14,169
more sites increasing their font sizes

101
00:04:14,169 --> 00:04:16,750
for example and CSS tricks a medium that

102
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:18,820
we have a font size of 21 pixels and

103
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:21,039
that's a good thing because 16 pixels

104
00:04:21,039 --> 00:04:23,460
for text is definitely not good enough

105
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:26,620
or not big enough of course it depends

106
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:29,349
on the font you're using but starting

107
00:04:29,349 --> 00:04:31,660
somewhere between 18 and 20 pixels is

108
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:34,150
probably a good thing and then working

109
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:36,430
your way up from there because usually

110
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:38,440
the bigger the screen size the bigger

111
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,539
the distance between the user and the

112
00:04:40,539 --> 00:04:44,199
screen so for a usage on a smart TV for

113
00:04:44,199 --> 00:04:45,729
example you would want to have a really

114
00:04:45,729 --> 00:04:48,190
big font size so people can read still

115
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:53,710
read the text from a far distance next

116
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:57,130
thing line height the line height in

117
00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:00,280
most browsers is at roughly 1.2 by

118
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:02,590
default the web accessibility initiative

119
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:05,620
recommends a line height of at least one

120
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:07,870
point five because for people with

121
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:11,199
cognitive disabilities it's easier to

122
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:13,630
start a new line after they have

123
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:15,580
finished the previous one if the line

124
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:18,400
height is bigger and on top of that if

125
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,860
you compare the two the second one looks

126
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:23,680
even nicer if the because of the bigger

127
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:28,700
line Heights

128
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:31,330
text is by default aligned to the left

129
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:34,330
or to the right depending on the reading

130
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:37,569
direction of the language and a thing

131
00:05:37,569 --> 00:05:40,419
designers like to do is to justify the

132
00:05:40,419 --> 00:05:43,650
text because justifying text makes

133
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:46,599
especially long text look nicer because

134
00:05:46,599 --> 00:05:49,090
all lines have the same length what the

135
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:51,039
browser does in order to get those same

136
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:53,680
length lines is that increases/decreases

137
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,099
the word spacing and this may result in

138
00:05:57,099 --> 00:06:00,250
irregular word spacing and for some

139
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:02,169
people it's harder to read text if the

140
00:06:02,169 --> 00:06:05,199
word spacing is irregular and on top of

141
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:07,090
that a friend of mine recently told me

142
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:09,639
that using justified text in web design

143
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:15,039
is so 2016 so it's bad for accessibility

144
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:17,129
and it's not cool so just don't do it

145
00:06:17,129 --> 00:06:23,169
please Dennis told me to say please here

146
00:06:23,169 --> 00:06:25,569
we have a nice paragraph the line height

147
00:06:25,569 --> 00:06:27,370
is all rights the font size is all

148
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:29,710
rights but something is odd about this

149
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:33,099
paragraph it's just too narrow not

150
00:06:33,099 --> 00:06:34,900
enough words fit per line it's it's hard

151
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:38,229
to read on the other hand in this

152
00:06:38,229 --> 00:06:40,810
paragraph the text is just too long the

153
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:42,819
paragraphs is too wide what's considered

154
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:45,789
ideal is a character count between 45

155
00:06:45,789 --> 00:06:49,029
and 75 characters per line so that's

156
00:06:49,029 --> 00:06:53,229
considered ideal yes so here for example

157
00:06:53,229 --> 00:06:55,889
we have a paragraph with a maximum

158
00:06:55,889 --> 00:06:58,960
maximum of about 65 characters per line

159
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,199
it looks nice and it's easy to read

160
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:03,339
what's cool about that is that we can

161
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:05,919
use CSS to control that we can set a max

162
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:08,550
width of this paragraph to 65 characters

163
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:11,289
the character unit has been around for

164
00:07:11,289 --> 00:07:13,479
quite a while now and it's pretty cool

165
00:07:13,479 --> 00:07:16,479
it represents the width of the glyph

166
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:20,289
zero in the elements font and this

167
00:07:20,289 --> 00:07:22,509
paragraph for example here will only be

168
00:07:22,509 --> 00:07:25,509
as big as to fit 65 characters roughly

169
00:07:25,509 --> 00:07:27,460
65 characters per line so that's pretty

170
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:29,909
cool

171
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:33,550
we have or there are several pseudo

172
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:36,310
elements you can use in CSS to create

173
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:38,889
cool things two of the more popular ones

174
00:07:38,889 --> 00:07:41,229
are before and after you can use before

175
00:07:41,229 --> 00:07:43,810
to add content directly after the start

176
00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:46,419
tag and after to add content directly

177
00:07:46,419 --> 00:07:49,930
before the end tag we can do cool to

178
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:52,990
stuff we can do cool stuff using those

179
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:54,999
pseudo elements but there is one thing

180
00:07:54,999 --> 00:07:57,759
we shouldn't do we should not add text

181
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:01,210
using CSS text belongs in an HTML file

182
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:03,819
coming from that database or API but it

183
00:08:03,819 --> 00:08:07,990
shouldn't be in CSS what we can do is we

184
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:10,719
can add icons or glyphs using CSS for

185
00:08:10,719 --> 00:08:14,139
example here this code will produce this

186
00:08:14,139 --> 00:08:19,270
nice-looking X and I've used this X here

187
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:22,240
to create a custom list I've removed the

188
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,370
default list styling and I've added

189
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:28,379
spans in each list item with this X and

190
00:08:28,379 --> 00:08:32,370
if the sound works we are going to hear

191
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:35,349
how the screenreader jaws on Windows is

192
00:08:35,349 --> 00:08:46,999
going to read this list

193
00:08:47,009 --> 00:08:50,110
okay doesn't matter it will it will say

194
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:53,769
Times item 1 times item 2 times item 3

195
00:08:53,769 --> 00:08:56,649
times item 4 because as it turns out

196
00:08:56,649 --> 00:08:58,899
this X isn't the X but the symbol four

197
00:08:58,899 --> 00:09:00,970
times like in two times two or three

198
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:03,069
times four and this can get very

199
00:09:03,069 --> 00:09:05,800
confusing because users might think that

200
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,990
we are multiplying all those list items

201
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:10,600
but in reality we're just using it as a

202
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:14,230
design feature as a bullet so what you

203
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:15,939
want to do here is you want to make sure

204
00:09:15,939 --> 00:09:18,970
that you hide those things semantically

205
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:21,160
this means that it's still visually

206
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,139
visible but hidden for screen readers

207
00:09:23,139 --> 00:09:25,209
and you can do that by using the area

208
00:09:25,209 --> 00:09:26,709
hidden attribute and setting it to true

209
00:09:26,709 --> 00:09:30,939
and by the way in this example don't do

210
00:09:30,939 --> 00:09:33,310
that what I just showed you you would

211
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:35,110
rather stick to the good old list I'll

212
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:37,509
type all this tile image for changing

213
00:09:37,509 --> 00:09:41,259
these icons is more accessible now a

214
00:09:41,259 --> 00:09:48,220
nice topic for today color contrast

215
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:59,100
color contrast is important because of

216
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:02,340
conferences and because 285 million

217
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:05,700
people are visually impaired 39 million

218
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:10,530
are blind and 246 have low vision 7 to

219
00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:13,350
12 percent of men and less than 1% of

220
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:16,020
women have some form of color vision

221
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:18,540
deficiency it's usually hard for them to

222
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:20,370
differentiate two colors like red and

223
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:23,040
green now the reason why color contrast

224
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,780
is important is that people deem their

225
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:26,430
screens on their smartphones for example

226
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:28,470
and people like to use their smartphones

227
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:30,680
outside even when the sun is shining so

228
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:33,420
we know color contrast is important but

229
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:36,450
how much is enough the web accessibility

230
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:39,180
initiative defines it by enough contrast

231
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,920
between text and its background so that

232
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:43,410
so that it can be read by people with

233
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:46,170
moderately low vision okay we got that

234
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:49,110
but you know we need in a number we need

235
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:50,820
a way to measure that and there is one

236
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:52,920
they got so called contest contrast

237
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:56,400
ratio the lowest ratio is one to one you

238
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,170
get that if you use the same color for

239
00:10:58,170 --> 00:11:01,230
text and background the highest ratio is

240
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:03,480
1 to 21 you get that if you use black

241
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:06,080
text on white background and vice versa

242
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:09,030
the minimum ratio for normal texts we

243
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:10,980
would like to achieve for normal text

244
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:13,530
that is less than 25 pixels is for 0.5

245
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:16,680
to 1 and the minimum ratio for bold text

246
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:19,530
that is less than 19 pixels is 3 to 1

247
00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:22,170
and for larger text it's also three to

248
00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:22,530
one

249
00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:25,200
that's the absolute minimum ideally you

250
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,620
would have a ratio of 7 to 1 for normal

251
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:32,960
text and 4.5 to 1 for bold text of

252
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:35,940
course there are ways to measure the

253
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:37,770
ratio for example there's one in the

254
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:39,960
browser made by leave a room you can

255
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,880
enter here on the left side the

256
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,350
background color and on the right side

257
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:44,730
the text color and it will give you the

258
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:46,380
score for example here we have a ratio

259
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:51,750
of 3.2 to 1 which is not enough but you

260
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:53,910
can change that and try some other

261
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:56,040
colors and the score will update and

262
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:58,890
here for example we have a score of 15

263
00:11:58,890 --> 00:12:01,280
point 3 to 1 which is very good

264
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:04,010
another way of testing accessibility is

265
00:12:04,010 --> 00:12:06,470
possible with deaf tools in Chrome

266
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:08,480
starting with Chrome 60 lighthouse is

267
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,970
baked in in chrome dev tools in an audit

268
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:13,430
panel and you can check your sites for

269
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:17,120
several best practices for PWO PWA best

270
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,490
practices accessibility performance and

271
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:22,790
general press best practices lighthouse

272
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:24,740
will check your sites and give you a

273
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:27,830
score and it will list all the things

274
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:30,290
that aren't alright and it for example

275
00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:32,330
here it will tell you which elements

276
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:35,240
don't have enough enough contrast so

277
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:37,430
that's pretty nice another great thing

278
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:40,070
is that you can display the color ratio

279
00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:42,380
directly in the color picker in chrome

280
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:45,170
dev tools that's not possible in

281
00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:47,120
standard chrome you have to get Chrome

282
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:50,360
Canary enable experiments and you have

283
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:55,940
to press shift seven times and then you

284
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:57,410
really have to do that and then you have

285
00:12:57,410 --> 00:13:03,140
to check the setting and that's it now

286
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:04,700
measuring is one thing but actually

287
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:08,839
testing is another thing again there are

288
00:13:08,839 --> 00:13:12,650
ways for us to test contrast ratios and

289
00:13:12,650 --> 00:13:15,620
so on for example in Windows you can

290
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:18,170
enter the settings and you will find

291
00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:19,910
high contrast settings and you can

292
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:22,070
switch the default theme of Windows to a

293
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:24,170
very high contrasting theme for example

294
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:27,860
like this one or this one or you can

295
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:31,670
also set your own colors here and I did

296
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:34,700
that and I made a very simple example

297
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:38,089
okay the contrast it's better now very

298
00:13:38,089 --> 00:13:39,950
simple example it's based on something I

299
00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:42,050
found in dribble it's something like a

300
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:44,570
login form and I used it in several high

301
00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:47,630
contrasting themes and this is what it

302
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:49,400
looks like what you can see here is that

303
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:51,560
the button isn't recognizable anymore

304
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:53,839
you see it's entered text but you don't

305
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:56,600
see that it is a button and if it wasn't

306
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,580
for the placeholder text you wouldn't

307
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:00,110
see the input fields they would be

308
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:02,870
invisible a really quick fix for me was

309
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:05,210
to add default borders for the input

310
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:06,740
fields and the buttons and now the

311
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:08,540
accessibility is much much better for

312
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:11,300
those for this simple form in high

313
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:14,510
contrast modes of course there was there

314
00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:14,810
was

315
00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:16,730
just quick fix there's a lot more to it

316
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:19,660
Annika hanker wrote a very awesome

317
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:22,610
article about that and I'm going to

318
00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:25,910
share it with my slides later on another

319
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:29,210
great tool is called no coffee

320
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:32,270
it's a browser plugin there you can set

321
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:34,250
several things for example you can make

322
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:37,370
the site blurry or you can simulate

323
00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:39,230
color deficiencies or you can even

324
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:41,270
simulate blocked visual fields so there

325
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:43,550
are a lot of things you can do in this

326
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:46,520
settings panel here to test stuff again

327
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:49,940
it's called no coffee the reason why I'm

328
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:52,370
talking about contrasts I guess you know

329
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:53,990
the reason but one of the reason when

330
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:56,000
reasons why I'm talking about contrast

331
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,970
is there has been a certain trend of

332
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:01,460
using low contrasting colors in web

333
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:04,820
design something like a grey on grey

334
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:07,790
text color on light grey backgrounds

335
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:10,100
now this might look nice but it's very

336
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:13,070
inaccessible and I'm pretty sure that

337
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:15,170
there are other colors than gray and

338
00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:20,420
light gray that look nice believe it or

339
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:22,370
not but people are still printing stuff

340
00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:24,050
out and people are even printing

341
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:26,480
websites people are printing contact

342
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:30,050
information directions recipes articles

343
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:32,720
pretty much everything and we should try

344
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,820
to give them at least some kind of

345
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:36,260
experience in that that's actually

346
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:38,870
pretty easy all you have to do is to

347
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:41,360
define a at media block in your CSS

348
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:44,360
similar to media queries and then change

349
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,160
all the items you want to look

350
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,380
differently on paper for example if you

351
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:50,420
have a fixed header you can set it to

352
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:53,930
static on paper or you can also maybe

353
00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:56,089
hide the navigation because it's

354
00:15:56,089 --> 00:16:00,420
probably pretty useless on paper

355
00:16:00,430 --> 00:16:03,820
who would fall another thing you can do

356
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:06,130
maybe is to by default hide everything

357
00:16:06,130 --> 00:16:08,770
or air it direct child item of the body

358
00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:10,870
except for the main content so hiding

359
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:14,200
the header and the footer and one thing

360
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,940
that's pretty cool about the print

361
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:18,010
medium is that we can use absolute units

362
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:20,020
like centimeter or millimeter and point

363
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:22,390
just makes sense you shouldn't use that

364
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:24,160
on a web but on paper it makes

365
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:27,040
absolutely sense something that special

366
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,230
about print is that links are

367
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:32,290
unfortunately useless you can click them

368
00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:35,589
you can try but you yeah it wouldn't

369
00:16:35,589 --> 00:16:38,650
work but there is a thing we can do to

370
00:16:38,650 --> 00:16:40,660
make them at least to put at least some

371
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:45,220
use in links on paper and that's it's

372
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:48,070
this selector here we can select all

373
00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:51,010
links that start with HTTP this includes

374
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:53,050
HTTP as well but it doesn't include

375
00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:55,690
relative paths or anchor links and then

376
00:16:55,690 --> 00:16:57,370
we make sure that we don't includes

377
00:16:57,370 --> 00:17:00,400
absolute links to our site and then we

378
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,230
use the after pseudo elements to adds

379
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:05,199
the content of the href attribute in

380
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:08,230
parentheses right next to the text so

381
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:10,660
this paragraph here will look like this

382
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:13,089
on screen and on paper it will look like

383
00:17:13,089 --> 00:17:15,160
this so the value of the href attribute

384
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:18,880
is printed next to the word it's not

385
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:22,569
perfect but it's something

386
00:17:22,579 --> 00:17:25,620
if you are like me you like to use the

387
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:27,809
keyboard sometimes for navigation on the

388
00:17:27,809 --> 00:17:29,370
website for example if you're filling

389
00:17:29,370 --> 00:17:32,070
out a long form because it's easier to

390
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:34,470
jump from one form iron to another if

391
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:36,770
you use the keyboard the tab key

392
00:17:36,770 --> 00:17:39,299
sometimes that works great and sometimes

393
00:17:39,299 --> 00:17:41,340
that doesn't work at all because we as

394
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:43,529
developers are pretty good at doing bad

395
00:17:43,529 --> 00:17:47,460
things to form items we are let me show

396
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:50,250
you some of those things here we have

397
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:53,820
two buttons when I click the first

398
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:56,789
button and alert pops up great if I

399
00:17:56,789 --> 00:17:59,760
click this second button the alert pops

400
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,470
up as well and now I'm going to use the

401
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:03,570
tab key to focus those buttons I can

402
00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:06,149
focus the first one but I can't focus

403
00:18:06,149 --> 00:18:08,940
the second one the reason for that is

404
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:10,529
that the first button is an html5

405
00:18:10,529 --> 00:18:13,110
pattern element the second button is a

406
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:15,750
DIF that looks like a button and divs

407
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:19,080
aren't focusable of course you can add

408
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:20,970
the tabindex attribute and make it 4

409
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:23,880
focusable but if you are already using

410
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,529
the keyboard you would probably want to

411
00:18:25,529 --> 00:18:27,029
do everything with the keyboard also

412
00:18:27,029 --> 00:18:28,919
triggering this event by clicking space

413
00:18:28,919 --> 00:18:31,140
or enter and you can only do that on the

414
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:32,850
button because we get those key events

415
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:34,860
for free with the button element that

416
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:37,700
just does just doesn't work on it if of

417
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:40,740
course you can add those events manually

418
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:42,390
but why would you if you just could use

419
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:43,830
button so please use button if you need

420
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:50,549
about another bad thing is here with a

421
00:18:50,549 --> 00:18:52,590
nice looking form and now you are going

422
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:54,299
to see which keys I'm pressing right

423
00:18:54,299 --> 00:19:01,040
next to the form

424
00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:02,270
[Music]

425
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:06,560
did you see that no you didn't because

426
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:09,660
that's in my CSS I'm selecting all items

427
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:11,910
in this page in their focus state and

428
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:14,460
I'm setting the outline to none but just

429
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:17,130
using those free lines I'm excluding a

430
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:18,840
whole group of people from being able to

431
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,430
use my sites

432
00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:23,160
if I remove those free lines you will

433
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:26,250
see this now all of a sudden we can see

434
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:28,170
where we are in the forum because we get

435
00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:33,270
this nice blurry blue line outline now

436
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:34,920
the reason why designers and developers

437
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,810
remove this blue outline in the first

438
00:19:36,810 --> 00:19:39,420
place is it's just actually just doesn't

439
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:42,300
look nice and on top of that it's very

440
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:44,640
inconsistent across browsers so for

441
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,020
example here on Chrome we will get this

442
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:48,090
blue outline on Firefox you will get a

443
00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:49,770
dotted outline and on Android for

444
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:52,620
example a solid orange outline so it

445
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:54,870
kind of makes sense to remove it but if

446
00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:56,880
you do provide at least some kind of

447
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,290
alternative styling you can use your

448
00:19:58,290 --> 00:20:00,690
branch colors and use solid borders

449
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:01,860
background color

450
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:05,220
link text color whatever it is just some

451
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:07,710
kind of focus stars and again you can do

452
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:10,260
it by using the focus of the class or

453
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:12,810
you can use some of the newer stuff for

454
00:20:12,810 --> 00:20:16,410
example here this form only this place

455
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:18,900
the border if one of its children has

456
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:22,320
focus so it's not the form itself that

457
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,060
it's focused but one of its child items

458
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:26,850
and that's possible using the focus

459
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:28,910
within pseudo class it's pretty new

460
00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:36,250
support is okay

461
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:38,570
but you can use it now if you're not

462
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:40,250
using it for anything too critical I

463
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:43,520
guess one thing that's annoying about

464
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,560
focus tiles is that sometimes they are

465
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:47,570
displayed when you don't want them to be

466
00:20:47,570 --> 00:20:49,040
displayed for example if you're using

467
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,720
the mouse so here for example we have a

468
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,940
custom tab component and you can see the

469
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:55,790
outline when I'm using the keyboard but

470
00:20:55,790 --> 00:20:58,850
now I'm going to click the tabs or the

471
00:20:58,850 --> 00:21:00,890
panels and it's still visible and this

472
00:21:00,890 --> 00:21:02,780
is not just annoying but also can be

473
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:04,580
very distracting to Mouse users so what

474
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:05,990
we need is a way to differentiate

475
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:07,940
between keyboard and mouse users and

476
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:10,130
that's possible using the focus ring

477
00:21:10,130 --> 00:21:12,530
pseudo-class focus ring pretty much does

478
00:21:12,530 --> 00:21:14,600
the same thing as focus but it only

479
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,970
applies those those Styles when it makes

480
00:21:16,970 --> 00:21:19,130
sense and the browser decides when it

481
00:21:19,130 --> 00:21:20,990
makes sense so we don't have to do much

482
00:21:20,990 --> 00:21:25,730
more unfortunately it only works in

483
00:21:25,730 --> 00:21:30,770
Firefox right now but but there is a

484
00:21:30,770 --> 00:21:32,300
very lightweight polyfill that you can

485
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:34,790
use check it out try it and maybe also

486
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:36,140
give feedback to the people who made it

487
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:39,050
so who are we making this for who are we

488
00:21:39,050 --> 00:21:39,590
making

489
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:41,570
focused odds for of course for us the

490
00:21:41,570 --> 00:21:42,950
power users who would like to use the

491
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:44,840
keyboard on long forms but especially

492
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:47,300
for people who actually rely on the

493
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:49,610
keyboard is the only way of navigation

494
00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:51,500
for example a person with just one arm

495
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:53,690
or maybe someone who would actually use

496
00:21:53,690 --> 00:21:55,340
the mouse but can't because he or she

497
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:58,310
broke their arm or maybe also a new

498
00:21:58,310 --> 00:22:00,020
parent who's holding the baby and has to

499
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:02,930
check something out online so it's

500
00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:04,250
important for us to know that there are

501
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:06,500
permanent temporary and situational

502
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:08,660
impairments and this makes the group of

503
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:10,010
potential keyboard users for example

504
00:22:10,010 --> 00:22:11,660
much much bigger

505
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:14,060
I took the graphics of the inclusive

506
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:15,560
design guide by Microsoft it's pretty

507
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:19,700
cool check it out all right it's now I'm

508
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:22,040
going to talk about some of the newer

509
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:26,960
stuff here about grids we have a list of

510
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,670
images here and I want to lay them out

511
00:22:28,670 --> 00:22:30,980
in a nice-looking grid that's pretty

512
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:33,290
easy with CSS grid layouts I just said

513
00:22:33,290 --> 00:22:35,780
that this beta grid I define as many

514
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:38,420
columns as fit the screen with a minimum

515
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:41,800
width of 180 pixels I add some spacing

516
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:44,720
vertical and horizontal spacing and I

517
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:47,270
said a default height for all rows in

518
00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:49,960
these grids so four lines of CSS

519
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:52,960
and we get this pretty awesome and it's

520
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:56,380
of course also completely responsive so

521
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:59,039
that's nice by the way the images are

522
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:01,480
scaled so nicely because I'm using

523
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:04,090
object fits Sara mentioned that in her

524
00:23:04,090 --> 00:23:06,820
talk the only thing that's not right

525
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:08,559
here is that we lost the different image

526
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:10,840
sizes we had big and long images we can

527
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:12,640
fix that I'm going to select all the

528
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,380
long and the large images and I'm going

529
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:16,690
to make them spend two rows and then I'm

530
00:23:16,690 --> 00:23:18,490
selecting the large images and make them

531
00:23:18,490 --> 00:23:20,740
span two columns and I'm going to place

532
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:22,210
the first one at the very end of our

533
00:23:22,210 --> 00:23:24,010
grids and the last one at the very

534
00:23:24,010 --> 00:23:25,720
beginning to make it look a little nicer

535
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:29,529
and this is what we get due to the

536
00:23:29,529 --> 00:23:31,870
implicit implicit placement at it and

537
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:33,580
the different image sizes we get those

538
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:36,880
gaps we can try to work around that

539
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,440
there is a property called grid Auto

540
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:41,049
flow and if you set value to dense the

541
00:23:41,049 --> 00:23:43,720
browser will try to fill those gaps and

542
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:48,640
this is what we get six lines of CSS and

543
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:51,539
of course also completely responsive

544
00:23:51,539 --> 00:23:55,870
this is super super super awesome and it

545
00:23:55,870 --> 00:24:01,480
sucks let's see what happens if you try

546
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:03,669
to use the keyboard on this gallery so

547
00:24:03,669 --> 00:24:06,549
the first image is focused now and I'm

548
00:24:06,549 --> 00:24:07,570
pressing tab okay

549
00:24:07,570 --> 00:24:10,620
oh where we going okay that's all right

550
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:13,929
which one is okay this one mm-hmm so

551
00:24:13,929 --> 00:24:16,990
since the browser reordered the items

552
00:24:16,990 --> 00:24:20,679
the visual order isn't anymore the same

553
00:24:20,679 --> 00:24:22,270
order as Dom order and that's bad for

554
00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:24,520
keyboard users because there's no way of

555
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:25,809
knowing which item is going to be

556
00:24:25,809 --> 00:24:28,690
focused next don't get me wrong

557
00:24:28,690 --> 00:24:30,909
please use grid and use everything grid

558
00:24:30,909 --> 00:24:32,890
has to offer it's really really awesome

559
00:24:32,890 --> 00:24:35,230
but just be careful when you're using it

560
00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:36,880
on very interactive interaction

561
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,980
sensitive stuff like forms prop no don't

562
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:41,980
use no forms but on galleries or stuff

563
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:44,980
like that this of course doesn't just

564
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:46,779
apply to grid but to pretty much any

565
00:24:46,779 --> 00:24:48,730
property that affects order in some way

566
00:24:48,730 --> 00:24:51,850
like flexbox position floats negative

567
00:24:51,850 --> 00:24:56,980
margins and so on all right okay since

568
00:24:56,980 --> 00:25:00,520
we are at a topic of grid who of you has

569
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:03,690
already used grids

570
00:25:03,690 --> 00:25:06,160
okay some people who used it in

571
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:12,190
production okay you're cool you cool do

572
00:25:12,190 --> 00:25:14,740
it it's awesome all major Brown major

573
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:16,240
browsers that ester browsers are

574
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:19,810
supported even edge since a week yeah or

575
00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:25,000
a few days so all major tester browsers

576
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,510
are supported of course they're still IE

577
00:25:28,510 --> 00:25:31,180
10 and 11 and older edge but you can

578
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:32,800
still use it thanks to the power of

579
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:35,260
progressive enhancement you can provide

580
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:37,120
a very basic version of your site for

581
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,280
example using floats and then enhance it

582
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:43,200
with grids let me show you a demo to

583
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,280
illustrate what I mean by that here we

584
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:47,020
have a very simple single column layout

585
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:49,330
it doesn't look nice because it's on a

586
00:25:49,330 --> 00:25:50,860
large screen but that's pretty much what

587
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:52,270
would you what you would get on a

588
00:25:52,270 --> 00:25:57,310
smartphone that's not very nice but it's

589
00:25:57,310 --> 00:25:59,230
alright I can enhance that by using

590
00:25:59,230 --> 00:26:03,360
float and now we have a layout it's

591
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:07,600
boring but it works we can enhance it

592
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:11,020
some more using flexbox and now

593
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:12,760
especially the lower part gets a little

594
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:14,290
more interesting so that's pretty cool

595
00:26:14,290 --> 00:26:16,780
and then we can enhance it some more and

596
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:21,000
to whatever we want because grids and

597
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,260
what's cool about that is that we don't

598
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:25,120
have to write 3 or 4 different versions

599
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:27,640
of a site we just provide this basic

600
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:30,340
layout using floats and then we put grid

601
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:32,830
on top of that because properties like

602
00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:34,420
display:inline-block display tab will

603
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:37,360
sell column properties floats don't work

604
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:39,490
on flags or grid items they just don't

605
00:26:39,490 --> 00:26:42,310
have any effect so you don't have to

606
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:44,410
override them for browsers that support

607
00:26:44,410 --> 00:26:48,040
grids they just simply don't do anything

608
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:50,530
anymore if the if they're applied to a

609
00:26:50,530 --> 00:26:53,140
grid or flex item the only time where

610
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:56,770
you have probably have to use feature

611
00:26:56,770 --> 00:26:59,680
queries is when you override widths or

612
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:02,380
margin something like that so that's

613
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:04,950
pretty cool and grid is cool but it also

614
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:10,960
introduces a new temptation let me show

615
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,580
you what I mean let's say we want to

616
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:13,750
build something like that we have a

617
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:15,870
heading and six items here

618
00:27:15,870 --> 00:27:19,559
and the HTML may look like this so we

619
00:27:19,559 --> 00:27:21,780
have a div and a heading an unordered

620
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:24,600
list and those six items I'm going to

621
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,430
use this big grid here again I'm going

622
00:27:26,430 --> 00:27:28,740
to create those free columns I'm setting

623
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:31,290
a gap again and I'm placing the heading

624
00:27:31,290 --> 00:27:33,420
and this is what we get

625
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:35,970
of course because only direct child

626
00:27:35,970 --> 00:27:37,830
items of a grid container are laid out

627
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:39,870
in a grid and the direct child items are

628
00:27:39,870 --> 00:27:42,630
the h2 and unordered list the worst

629
00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:44,700
thing you can do is to remove the

630
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:46,800
unordered list and transform all the

631
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,720
divs to lists I add all the list items

632
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:51,390
divs you should not compromise on

633
00:27:51,390 --> 00:27:53,850
semantics for design or deaf experience

634
00:27:53,850 --> 00:27:58,620
reasons don't do that please please what

635
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:00,780
you could do is to good use display sub

636
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:01,290
grids

637
00:28:01,290 --> 00:28:03,330
if you apply to an unordered list the

638
00:28:03,330 --> 00:28:05,300
list items will behave as if they were

639
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:08,160
direct child items of the div themselves

640
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:12,000
unfortunately display subgrid didn't

641
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,050
make it into level one of the

642
00:28:13,050 --> 00:28:15,240
specification but it will probably come

643
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:18,450
with level two I don't know when but we

644
00:28:18,450 --> 00:28:21,179
hope another thing you could do is to

645
00:28:21,179 --> 00:28:23,580
set the display to contents the contents

646
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:26,940
will make the lists list items behave as

647
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:28,710
if their parent the unordered list

648
00:28:28,710 --> 00:28:31,410
didn't exist at all so they would behave

649
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:33,450
as if they were direct child items of

650
00:28:33,450 --> 00:28:38,850
the grid container yeah no Firefox again

651
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:40,559
is the only browser that supports that

652
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:43,230
so what you ultimately have to do is to

653
00:28:43,230 --> 00:28:45,540
define another grid in this unordered

654
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:48,360
list so again these blue grids three

655
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:50,490
columns and gap I know that's not cool

656
00:28:50,490 --> 00:28:54,150
but it's it's something since the

657
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:55,830
unordered list has the same width as the

658
00:28:55,830 --> 00:28:58,350
container you can make it span all three

659
00:28:58,350 --> 00:29:00,030
columns and just inherit all the

660
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:01,770
properties so you can inherit all the

661
00:29:01,770 --> 00:29:03,780
disparate properties it's a little nicer

662
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:09,030
yeah whatever it is you do don't flatten

663
00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:11,330
the structure don't do that

664
00:29:11,330 --> 00:29:14,640
of course that's not everything you have

665
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:17,370
to know about CSS and accessibility but

666
00:29:17,370 --> 00:29:18,900
it's also more than just a starting

667
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:21,059
point let's say you take two of the

668
00:29:21,059 --> 00:29:23,309
things I showed you today and care about

669
00:29:23,309 --> 00:29:24,630
them in your next project you are

670
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:27,179
already doing a really great job and if

671
00:29:27,179 --> 00:29:28,970
you take two more things and apply the

672
00:29:28,970 --> 00:29:30,320
in your next project you are working

673
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:33,140
towards a better more inclusive and more

674
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:36,049
open web it's important that we as

675
00:29:36,049 --> 00:29:38,059
designers and developers don't just

676
00:29:38,059 --> 00:29:40,640
design and make websites for the way we

677
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:44,860
are using it we must not assume that our

678
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:47,870
users are using a certain operating

679
00:29:47,870 --> 00:29:50,840
system input device browser or device

680
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:55,789
and as my mentor Aaron Gusterson said

681
00:29:55,789 --> 00:29:57,890
designing with constraints in mind is

682
00:29:57,890 --> 00:30:01,250
simply designing well I know mother was

683
00:30:01,250 --> 00:30:04,370
a lot but there is a written form of

684
00:30:04,370 --> 00:30:06,679
this article online on medium that of

685
00:30:06,679 --> 00:30:09,530
this talk online on medium and I can

686
00:30:09,530 --> 00:30:11,539
recommend a very awesome book by Hayden

687
00:30:11,539 --> 00:30:13,070
Pickering it's called inclusive design

688
00:30:13,070 --> 00:30:15,020
patterns I even have it with me so if

689
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:17,559
you want to take a look feel free to

690
00:30:17,559 --> 00:30:20,929
meet me afterwards again the slides are

691
00:30:20,929 --> 00:30:24,240
online thank you very much
