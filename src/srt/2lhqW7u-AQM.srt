[Music]

2
00:00:08,119 --> 00:00:15,990


3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,170
[Music]

4
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:18,640
all right we're here to talk about

5
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,680
Sencha touch hopefully you're in the

6
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:25,029
right place my name is Dave Canada that

7
00:00:25,029 --> 00:00:28,689
is an awesome cartoon of me I so I wrote

8
00:00:28,689 --> 00:00:30,490
about three years ago I wrote a plug-in

9
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:33,760
called JQ touch for jQuery it's a

10
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:36,580
plug-in that sort of makes you allows

11
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:38,440
you to create web pages that feel a

12
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:40,300
little bit more like iPhone apps or

13
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:43,300
mobile apps about a year and a half ago

14
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:45,670
I moved over to Sencha and we started to

15
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:48,430
kind of redo the same thing but based on

16
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:51,550
a JavaScript API and way way more

17
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:54,909
powerful so that's my twitter handle

18
00:00:54,909 --> 00:00:57,010
that's the company's twitter handle if

19
00:00:57,010 --> 00:00:59,080
you have any questions if I go too fast

20
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:02,769
I am gonna rush just shoot me a question

21
00:01:02,769 --> 00:01:06,390
on Twitter and I'll try to answer it and

22
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:10,570
full speed ahead so since a touch is a

23
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:13,330
free JavaScript framework for building

24
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:16,299
rich mobile apps we are an

25
00:01:16,299 --> 00:01:19,270
object-oriented framework so you know we

26
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:22,600
use the classical inheritance model we

27
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,579
have things like MVC we have things like

28
00:01:24,579 --> 00:01:26,500
data I'll talk more about those in a

29
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:28,600
little bit but first I think it's

30
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:29,829
important that you just sort of get an

31
00:01:29,829 --> 00:01:33,969
idea of what it can do so that being

32
00:01:33,969 --> 00:01:37,090
said I'm going to show a couple apps

33
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:41,079
this first one is TravelMate so again

34
00:01:41,079 --> 00:01:42,850
this is a web app this is built with

35
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:45,520
JavaScript you can see things we have

36
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,820
like we have things like a carousel this

37
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:54,429
one's a little translation tool we have

38
00:01:54,429 --> 00:01:59,380
these sort of Pickers and again that's

39
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:05,140
all being done just in a web app this

40
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:07,329
next one is the schedule for a

41
00:02:07,329 --> 00:02:08,890
conference I just went to a couple weeks

42
00:02:08,890 --> 00:02:11,290
ago in Dallas the breaking development

43
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:13,660
conference anyone there anyway go there

44
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:21,220
yeah I know you and you can see we're

45
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:22,690
adding it to the home screen we get a

46
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:27,040
custom icon and when we launch it again

47
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:31,770
no browser bar custom startup screen

48
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:36,750
and it feels like a real native app

49
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:38,890
right we think we have things like the A

50
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:42,280
to Z controller on the right we have the

51
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:47,050
grouped headers in the list pull in some

52
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:52,720
tweets custom messaging little map

53
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:57,070
component I really like how recently

54
00:02:57,070 --> 00:02:59,080
they added the ability within the Google

55
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:01,350
Maps so that you can actually do the

56
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:04,330
Street View directly in it and it works

57
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:07,660
great within the framework alright

58
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:12,070
that's pretty cool right and some basic

59
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:15,280
pages whatever and then this last one is

60
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,110
called irresistible this is done by a

61
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:18,520
friend of mine Nick he's sitting over

62
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:21,370
there this is for a food delivery

63
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:26,410
service in the UK Nick built this I

64
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:28,120
should have asked beforehand but I think

65
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:31,180
it took him about a week and I think he

66
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:33,040
said within the first weekend it

67
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,840
basically paid for the entire time he

68
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,459
spent developing the app because so many

69
00:03:36,459 --> 00:03:46,630
people used it awesome little CSS

70
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:49,030
animation done with our CSS animator

71
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:51,820
tool but we're here to talk about since

72
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:54,790
you touch so and this is something new

73
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:56,739
so I wanted to try everybody's just

74
00:03:56,739 --> 00:03:58,150
gonna be on their laptops the entire

75
00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:00,070
time I figure anyway so you might as

76
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:01,450
well be checking out our stuff while you

77
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:01,750
do it

78
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:05,049
this is for a kitchen sink demo this

79
00:04:05,049 --> 00:04:07,930
just is sort of like a big combination

80
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:09,910
of all our demos has some data features

81
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:11,890
in there but mostly shows off all the UI

82
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:14,170
so go ahead and pull it up it's got to

83
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:17,290
be in a webkit-based browser so open up

84
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:21,960
chrome check it out JMP slash touch sink

85
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:24,610
so the reason I think Sencha touch is

86
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:27,400
cool is details matter this was

87
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,500
something Brian fling friend of mine

88
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:33,190
said in Dallas a couple weeks ago and I

89
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:35,830
think it's true I think in terms of UX

90
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:37,510
in terms of usability when you're

91
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:39,700
looking at mobile apps the details the

92
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:41,409
way somebody interacts with the app is

93
00:04:41,409 --> 00:04:44,199
important for example that TravelMate

94
00:04:44,199 --> 00:04:45,489
app when you have two Pickers

95
00:04:45,489 --> 00:04:46,989
side-by-side when you're converting

96
00:04:46,989 --> 00:04:49,659
languages that's the best way really to

97
00:04:49,659 --> 00:04:52,389
show off or to to get the user to switch

98
00:04:52,389 --> 00:04:54,429
to languages right that would be a lot

99
00:04:54,429 --> 00:04:56,379
harder to do and a lot less pleasant to

100
00:04:56,379 --> 00:05:01,689
do with two select elements just the you

101
00:05:01,689 --> 00:05:06,159
know microseconds matter to a user and

102
00:05:06,159 --> 00:05:07,719
that being said I think such a touch is

103
00:05:07,719 --> 00:05:10,749
sort of the sweet spot in mobile web app

104
00:05:10,749 --> 00:05:14,739
design between web and native so you

105
00:05:14,739 --> 00:05:16,269
know there are benefits to doing things

106
00:05:16,269 --> 00:05:18,819
natively you have all of your UI all of

107
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:21,249
your apps sort of on the device and all

108
00:05:21,249 --> 00:05:23,979
you're doing is requesting data that's a

109
00:05:23,979 --> 00:05:25,809
really nice thing to do that speeds

110
00:05:25,809 --> 00:05:29,619
stuff up a lot for your users everybody

111
00:05:29,619 --> 00:05:31,899
here I assume knows the benefits of web

112
00:05:31,899 --> 00:05:35,800
development better debugging lots of

113
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:38,800
developers they're cheaper it's fast

114
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,249
it's awesome it's cross-platform I don't

115
00:05:42,249 --> 00:05:44,409
have to sell you guys on web right you

116
00:05:44,409 --> 00:05:45,369
guys like the web

117
00:05:45,369 --> 00:05:50,259
I hope devices we support iOS the only

118
00:05:50,259 --> 00:05:51,729
thing I want to point out is that we do

119
00:05:51,729 --> 00:05:54,069
support the iPad really well which is

120
00:05:54,069 --> 00:05:56,769
something some other sort of players in

121
00:05:56,769 --> 00:05:58,719
this field don't do at the moment we

122
00:05:58,719 --> 00:06:02,050
have a very rich layout system and it

123
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:04,289
looks awesome on the iPad the iPad 2 is

124
00:06:04,289 --> 00:06:07,300
insanely awesome blazing fast I can give

125
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:10,449
a demo later somebody wants then there's

126
00:06:10,449 --> 00:06:13,689
the bajillion androids we support all

127
00:06:13,689 --> 00:06:17,199
those the tablet again and the same

128
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:19,779
thing with blackberry tablet all these

129
00:06:19,779 --> 00:06:21,399
things are just WebKit so basically

130
00:06:21,399 --> 00:06:23,559
we're saying we support WebKit on mobile

131
00:06:23,559 --> 00:06:26,439
I think we are getting ready to start

132
00:06:26,439 --> 00:06:29,499
looking at Touch 2.0 and hopefully we

133
00:06:29,499 --> 00:06:31,719
will look at some extra platforms and

134
00:06:31,719 --> 00:06:33,579
things like that but I can't talk about

135
00:06:33,579 --> 00:06:38,199
that now so what you get and this would

136
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:40,329
be a good time to open up that like sync

137
00:06:40,329 --> 00:06:42,149
demo and just sort of play along because

138
00:06:42,149 --> 00:06:47,079
these are the dry slide portion touch

139
00:06:47,079 --> 00:06:49,539
events so at the very core of what we do

140
00:06:49,539 --> 00:06:51,699
is sort of one of the base layers is

141
00:06:51,699 --> 00:06:53,680
abstract all the touch events on the

142
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,070
device

143
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:56,110
by default you get four touch events

144
00:06:56,110 --> 00:06:58,060
touch start touch end touch move and

145
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:01,240
touch cancel we go a step further than

146
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,650
that we abstract them all to the

147
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:04,360
document so that their performance so

148
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,610
you're not binding you no touch events

149
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:08,460
to every list item or things like that

150
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:11,110
it's all handled in the background for

151
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:13,170
you when you bind an event our way and

152
00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:15,820
in doing so we actually get to add in a

153
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:17,770
whole bunch of sort of more sensible

154
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:19,960
default events so you get things like

155
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:23,920
tap DoubleTap pinch rotate stuff like

156
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:26,200
that stuff that makes sense stuff you

157
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:30,040
want to bind to the next thing we do on

158
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,720
top of the touch event is our own

159
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,460
scrolling layer how many people know

160
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:34,900
what I'm talking about when I say fake

161
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:37,810
scrolling on iOS mobile Safari

162
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:40,330
that is awesome this crowd rocks alright

163
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:41,590
so I'm just going to show it then cuz

164
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:44,010
you guys know what I'm talking about

165
00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:49,510
it's so smooth right buttery smooth

166
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:53,340
we've spent months simply on this scroll

167
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:56,050
both in getting the right momentum the

168
00:07:56,050 --> 00:07:58,000
right physics and then actually making

169
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,460
that performant on things like Android

170
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:03,070
and Blackberry which if you go out to do

171
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:09,430
on your own good luck then we have a

172
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:11,830
whole lot of components I won't bore you

173
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:13,510
with the whole list but you guys can

174
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:17,380
read and again play along JMP

175
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:19,510
touch sync you can try them all out in

176
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:22,900
Chrome or if you even have the you know

177
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:24,720
some sort of emulator throw them in that

178
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:30,550
try it out on the theming side of things

179
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:33,669
this is sort of my contribution my

180
00:08:33,669 --> 00:08:35,979
brainchild to the framework this is my

181
00:08:35,979 --> 00:08:38,530
favorite part all of our themes are

182
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:40,690
first of all of course based on css3

183
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:42,640
because we're targeting WebKit so you

184
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,500
get all of the awesome gradients text

185
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:47,110
shadows box shadows etc but then we've

186
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:48,550
actually taken it a step further and

187
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:51,940
abstracted that with sass and compass so

188
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:54,850
basically sass encompass give you the

189
00:08:54,850 --> 00:08:56,920
ability to use things like variables and

190
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:59,860
mix-ins within your CSS and we've

191
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:01,690
created a whole framework on top of that

192
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:04,690
system including our own mix-ins our own

193
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:06,790
variables so you can actually take the

194
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:07,930
default since you touch

195
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:11,260
theme and change it pretty pretty

196
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:15,370
incredibly on-the-fly and hopefully if

197
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:17,140
we have time I will get to show that off

198
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:18,910
the other important thing to note is we

199
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:22,570
include a ton of icons by default icons

200
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:24,850
are important on mobile you can

201
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:26,800
optionally include them all in your app

202
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,779
they all come in basics before encoded

203
00:09:28,779 --> 00:09:31,240
into your CSS which is great for latency

204
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:33,850
on mobile and then the last thing I want

205
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:34,690
to mention is there all

206
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:35,830
resolution-independent

207
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:37,899
so one big goal we've had from the

208
00:09:37,899 --> 00:09:40,120
beginning of our theme is trying to get

209
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,279
it so that a button is the same physical

210
00:09:42,279 --> 00:09:45,839
size regardless of the ppi of the device

211
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:48,399
across all the devices which is a

212
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:53,470
challenge so then this is something the

213
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:56,170
more techie audience might appreciate we

214
00:09:56,170 --> 00:09:58,120
do include a full data package with

215
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:00,160
Sencha touch as well as our desktop

216
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,980
counterpart XJS this gives you things on

217
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:05,589
the client side like an ORM like client

218
00:10:05,589 --> 00:10:08,529
side associations you get you know

219
00:10:08,529 --> 00:10:11,230
validations field validations and then

220
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:13,180
we have a whole bunch of data stores

221
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:16,450
data proxies etc that make it really

222
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:18,970
easy to work with any sort of API

223
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:23,260
endpoint XML rest JSON whatever you want

224
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:26,080
and then we also actually have a proxy

225
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:28,720
set up specifically for offline storage

226
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,300
so you can easily take some data you get

227
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:35,890
online and take it offline and that

228
00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:37,450
being said all of that sort of comes

229
00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:39,310
together into a full application

230
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:41,110
architecture which is something that not

231
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:44,050
a lot of frameworks nowadays offer we

232
00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:46,060
include things like MVC we include data

233
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:48,610
we include the theming as you saw some

234
00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:49,959
others I didn't get to mention our

235
00:10:49,959 --> 00:10:52,050
history support device detection

236
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:54,040
orientation events this is just kind of

237
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:56,079
become a catch-all for just random

238
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:58,510
things I don't talk about layout system

239
00:10:58,510 --> 00:11:01,990
animations etc at any rate I encourage

240
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:04,440
you to play around with it

241
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,610
that being said we're very rich

242
00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:08,560
framework we have a lot of features law

243
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:11,200
functionality so it's important to note

244
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,540
we have a lot of sort of support venues

245
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:17,709
for you we have the API Docs which are

246
00:11:17,709 --> 00:11:19,810
getting an improvement very soon little

247
00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:21,279
makeover you can check

248
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:24,819
an XJS 4 and then we have forums that

249
00:11:24,819 --> 00:11:27,160
are super active we have over 200,000

250
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:30,910
active members of our forums and we have

251
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:32,860
a learn section which with a bunch of

252
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:35,110
tutorials getting started guides all

253
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:37,720
that kind of stuff and that's actually

254
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:40,079
getting a makeover soon as well I hope

255
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:43,870
and then lastly once you create your

256
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:46,029
awesome web app with Sencha touch how do

257
00:11:46,029 --> 00:11:47,920
you distribute it like you saw in some

258
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,240
of the preview movies you can just

259
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:51,180
distribute it in the browser works great

260
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:54,189
you may want to wrap it up in something

261
00:11:54,189 --> 00:11:58,240
like PhoneGap if you want device access

262
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,790
or you want to put it on the App Store

263
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:03,309
the Android Marketplace blackberry app

264
00:12:03,309 --> 00:12:08,230
world I think so yeah thumb gap rocks

265
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:10,569
highly recommended works great with

266
00:12:10,569 --> 00:12:15,790
Sencha touch and then lastly just sort

267
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:18,730
of looking ahead to the future some of

268
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:20,019
the things we're going to bring in in

269
00:12:20,019 --> 00:12:21,759
Touch 2.0 we're still discussing

270
00:12:21,759 --> 00:12:24,759
features so this isn't exactly the

271
00:12:24,759 --> 00:12:26,500
feature list of what's coming in touch

272
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,660
2.0 this is just sort of the hard set

273
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:30,879
minimum we know what we're bringing in

274
00:12:30,879 --> 00:12:33,160
we're going to improve the MVC system a

275
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:37,269
lot we are implementing a new build

276
00:12:37,269 --> 00:12:39,459
system which will automatically create

277
00:12:39,459 --> 00:12:42,759
an optimized javascript file and

278
00:12:42,759 --> 00:12:45,309
optimize build for your app by literally

279
00:12:45,309 --> 00:12:47,079
launching your app in the background

280
00:12:47,079 --> 00:12:49,240
seeing its dependencies and then

281
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:52,209
automatically creating one minified

282
00:12:52,209 --> 00:12:54,519
javascript file for you of your app and

283
00:12:54,519 --> 00:12:56,920
taking out everything you don't use that

284
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:59,410
is awesome I'm just throwing that out

285
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:01,779
there now charting extension which is

286
00:13:01,779 --> 00:13:03,069
sort of based off of our desktop

287
00:13:03,069 --> 00:13:05,439
charting that we're doing right now a

288
00:13:05,439 --> 00:13:08,259
dynamic loading system which sort of

289
00:13:08,259 --> 00:13:10,410
goes along with the optimized builds and

290
00:13:10,410 --> 00:13:14,170
improved history support the one more

291
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:16,089
thing referenced at the bottom of the

292
00:13:16,089 --> 00:13:22,209
slide is our GUI and I apologize this is

293
00:13:22,209 --> 00:13:23,620
a little but ugly right now but this is

294
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:27,639
way alpha prototype we are working on a

295
00:13:27,639 --> 00:13:29,259
drag-and-drop system to put together

296
00:13:29,259 --> 00:13:37,560
your views which will be awesome

297
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:39,890
how's this rate going for everyone too

298
00:13:39,890 --> 00:13:43,060
fast too slow I think it's good yeah

299
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:45,170
should I had an extra shot of coffee

300
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:51,900
before I came up save two minutes I

301
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:53,990
think this is going to be really sweet

302
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:59,450
once we get this thing together so so

303
00:13:59,450 --> 00:14:01,820
the concluding slides if you like some

304
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:03,980
of this stuff and you find it

305
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:05,630
interesting you like sort of recreating

306
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:08,780
native interfaces with web tech come

307
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:10,640
talk to me because we are hiring and

308
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:12,560
like crazy

309
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,990
we are growing an insane amount I think

310
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:16,700
I joined about a year and a half ago not

311
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:19,370
even I was the eighth person on the team

312
00:14:19,370 --> 00:14:21,500
and I think just last week we did a

313
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:26,420
recount we've just hit 60 so come on

314
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:30,800
board we'll take you all right so that's

315
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:31,760
pretty much it

316
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,340
again our web site center comm my

317
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:36,650
twitter name I'm not done yet though I

318
00:14:36,650 --> 00:14:38,390
am going to show you guys some code

319
00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:40,670
because we actually did that in 14

320
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:43,880
minutes and 24 seconds round of applause

321
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:50,600
for the time come on that's usually an

322
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,640
hour presentation just throw that out

323
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:56,150
there you're like thank God because I

324
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:58,750
couldn't sit through that for an hour

325
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:01,070
all right I'm gonna go back to the

326
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:12,290
mirror

327
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:15,010
destroyed my desktop

328
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:22,380
lame

329
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:26,870
Twitter Shh nobody @reply me right now

330
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:34,530
okay it's okay you can keep them coming

331
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:39,800
all right so this is an app I did with

332
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,930
O'Reilly conferences for their

333
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:44,210
conferences schedule app you'll kind of

334
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:45,830
recognize the one we showed earlier that

335
00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:48,380
orange one the breaking Devlin they kind

336
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:54,290
of pirate patch this one so again you

337
00:15:54,290 --> 00:15:55,550
know we have a list you can see I'm

338
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:57,170
running it right in Frome right now I

339
00:15:57,170 --> 00:15:59,120
have to do the whole drag to scroll

340
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,890
thing but other than that it's pretty

341
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:10,160
awesome right cool app cool app all

342
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,350
right you guys have seen it you're bored

343
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:15,400
so let's look at code is that readable

344
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:19,000
good awesome

345
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,710
well first I'm just gonna sort of

346
00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:24,680
quickly look at this class for this app

347
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:27,230
keep in mind this whole app this whole

348
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:28,730
conference app which you saw is pretty

349
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:31,220
rich has a tab bar has tweets brings in

350
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:33,620
data all this kind of stuff it's about

351
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:35,720
600 lines of this JavaScript of

352
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:38,030
JavaScript that looks like this which is

353
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:43,970
pretty short for such a full app so just

354
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:46,460
to give you guys some idea you can see

355
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:49,760
we are creating a object called a

356
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:52,970
session list which extends a basic panel

357
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:57,050
ext dot panel we throw it some config

358
00:16:57,050 --> 00:17:02,150
options like the layout card some custom

359
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:05,150
options I threw in there then within

360
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:07,820
that panel we throw a list which we just

361
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:10,280
create a new ext dot list again give it

362
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:14,360
some config options we have a quick

363
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:16,340
inline template for each of the rows in

364
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:19,970
that list for each session and basically

365
00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:23,150
all we do is set up a data store against

366
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:25,070
a model and I'll show you real quick

367
00:17:25,070 --> 00:17:28,430
those models are wacky easy and if any

368
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:30,050
of my colleagues saw me putting all of

369
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:31,880
my models in one class I would tell

370
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:34,520
get yelled at but uh or in one file

371
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:37,190
rather sorry but anyway there's my

372
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:39,290
proposal model you can see it has the

373
00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:42,350
association with speakers and then I

374
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:44,120
just sort of say what the fields are

375
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:48,710
going to be I then pass that model into

376
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:50,990
the data store say that we're gonna sort

377
00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:54,620
it by time the group string is going to

378
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:57,020
be a pretty time variable on that data

379
00:17:57,020 --> 00:18:00,050
and then the proxy is basically just a

380
00:18:00,050 --> 00:18:05,180
JSON one we say script tag coming from

381
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:07,130
this API endpoint we're not going to

382
00:18:07,130 --> 00:18:09,910
cache it that's for my own purposes I

383
00:18:09,910 --> 00:18:13,550
think I was debugging something and the

384
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:15,650
root node is proposals and then after

385
00:18:15,650 --> 00:18:17,300
that it basically looks at that JSON

386
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:19,670
goes to the proposals note looks at that

387
00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:23,030
array grabs all those objects matches up

388
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:26,420
the objects in there sorry the

389
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:28,340
attributes in there against this

390
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:31,760
template and then creates that list it's

391
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:36,110
pretty simple right louder no just I

392
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:40,070
don't care so we have a selection change

393
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:47,690
event when you tap on a list item so

394
00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:49,670
this is cool when you when you click one

395
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:52,100
of those dates at the top so we have

396
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:56,360
these guys right all we're really doing

397
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:59,420
you know in the sort of jQuery mentality

398
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:02,270
and totally not bashing jQuery I love

399
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:04,760
them but you know you would be when you

400
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:06,080
click one of those dates you would be

401
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,970
clearing a Dom list you would be saying

402
00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:11,210
grab this ul clear the Dom you know go

403
00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:13,480
through my JSON re-inject it this way

404
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:15,830
here dealing with sort of an app

405
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:17,420
architecture dealing with data stores

406
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:20,480
data miles etc you can see we're really

407
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,190
simply just clearing a filter on the

408
00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:25,510
datastore that's bound to that list and

409
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:28,160
then re filtering it on the date from

410
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:31,630
that button which is way simpler right

411
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:34,710
it's all about UI binding

412
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:37,520
and then I scroll to the top just cuz

413
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:43,390
I'm a sucker for details

414
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:45,930
so does that look cool to everybody so

415
00:19:45,930 --> 00:19:48,210
that kind of makes sense that's kind of

416
00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:50,400
all I'm gonna that was not nearly strong

417
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,950
enough a reaction to the cool part come

418
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:56,040
on no as long as you get it and

419
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:58,020
hopefully I can squeeze in like a few

420
00:19:58,020 --> 00:19:59,940
questions just real quick I'm gonna show

421
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:02,130
off the theming system so this is what

422
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:03,510
the theme for this app looks like you

423
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:04,920
can tell it is a little custom we have

424
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:06,450
kind of like a pink thing going on right

425
00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:08,910
now let's say we didn't want it to be

426
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:10,860
pink next year we're remaking this app

427
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:13,290
for the next conference but the next app

428
00:20:13,290 --> 00:20:18,030
is actually green we could just throw

429
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:19,500
that in there this is actually getting

430
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,960
compiled behind the scenes with sass oh

431
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:25,680
no it's not so I can just run compass

432
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:28,590
watch that the folder where that files

433
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:31,490
living it's going to take a look at it

434
00:20:31,490 --> 00:20:36,300
recompile the CSS whip that new color

435
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:42,900
change and now everything's green right

436
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:45,360
so we have about 50 to 60 variables in

437
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,940
touch you can see even the selected

438
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:50,880
state is green back buttons green it's

439
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,130
sort of taken over every possible place

440
00:20:53,130 --> 00:20:56,100
it could again with about 50 or 60

441
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:57,930
variables you can get a lot more

442
00:20:57,930 --> 00:20:59,910
granular with your control I'm just

443
00:20:59,910 --> 00:21:01,560
changing base color because it is the

444
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:02,910
most sweeping change it's the most

445
00:21:02,910 --> 00:21:06,090
noticeable some other sort of big ones

446
00:21:06,090 --> 00:21:09,630
or we could say the overall base

447
00:21:09,630 --> 00:21:15,120
gradient is glossy all right make sure

448
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:20,400
that fires and now everything's glossy

449
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:25,350
you guys see that

450
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:31,510
and as I mentioned we can get a lot more

451
00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:33,220
granular so let's say we just want the

452
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:35,170
tab bar at the bottom to be glossy got

453
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:42,760
get a little more iOS feeling I guess it

454
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:46,330
only does the tabs yeah that's still

455
00:21:46,330 --> 00:21:52,720
cool so that's it do we have some time

456
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:53,500
for questions

457
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:57,880
yeah let's say yes that would be

458
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:00,970
difficult the question was you know are

459
00:22:00,970 --> 00:22:03,220
the is the scroller components or

460
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:04,870
separated enough that you could be used

461
00:22:04,870 --> 00:22:08,140
outside the framework not in the same

462
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:10,210
way things like glove box and you know

463
00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:13,660
touch scroll or I scroll whatever it's

464
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:15,700
not as componentized as that it does use

465
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:18,730
some of our other classes hypothetically

466
00:22:18,730 --> 00:22:20,620
if we get the build system to the point

467
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:23,500
where we want it to be fine then don't

468
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:27,240
show the thank you sign oh did I kick it

469
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:29,860
then hopefully that will be possible at

470
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:34,330
a certain point yeah that's a good

471
00:22:34,330 --> 00:22:36,250
question so the question is is it really

472
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:40,270
free yeah it's free so basically just to

473
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:42,040
sort of explain it a little bit we do

474
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:44,080
have a commercial license and a GPL

475
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,960
license they're both free sounds wacky

476
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:50,110
I know but basically we do it so that

477
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:52,210
you can't create a tool that creates

478
00:22:52,210 --> 00:22:53,500
other sense of touch apps and then

479
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:55,150
distribute that and sell that and all

480
00:22:55,150 --> 00:22:57,130
that kind of stuff but in general if you

481
00:22:57,130 --> 00:22:58,600
just want to use it to like get you know

482
00:22:58,600 --> 00:22:59,919
you have five apps that you want to put

483
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:01,120
on the App Store at the Android

484
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:04,750
Marketplace go for it free if you are a

485
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:07,179
school or a non-profit or you're doing

486
00:23:07,179 --> 00:23:09,160
something open-source you do the GPL way

487
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:12,160
still free so yeah totally free we do

488
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:14,080
have paid support options stuff like

489
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,900
that but really the company rests a lot

490
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:18,940
more on the XJS side for the commercial

491
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:22,750
licenses such as just open we figure

492
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:25,570
it's a lot more consumer centric so we

493
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:27,299
just kind of want to get it out there

494
00:23:27,299 --> 00:23:29,530
alright so I know I'm holding up the

495
00:23:29,530 --> 00:23:31,660
next guy thank you guys a ton find me

496
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:33,820
afterwards okay
