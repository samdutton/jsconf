1
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:10,260

everyone a marquee on 11 sometimes

2
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:14,430
and the people we met at the next I'll

3
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:16,590
festival the organizer of the festival's

4
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:20,610
here as well I prepared a few like 20

5
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:23,010
different demos and like i'm playing i'm

6
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:24,420
doing like playing with a lot of toys

7
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:26,700
and make what I thing is toys and

8
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:29,220
general so on this is one of them and

9
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:31,230
i'm going to show you kind of like the

10
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:34,050
journey and look how and why i guess i

11
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:37,980
got when i got so um yeah i can so this

12
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:40,350
is my simple setup this is usually what

13
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:43,500
excel all the products with so on there

14
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,809
was a great brave talk on creativity by

15
00:00:45,809 --> 00:00:47,909
john cleese and he compared basically

16
00:00:47,909 --> 00:00:50,699
creativity to a playground so like you

17
00:00:50,699 --> 00:00:52,170
come you can be stressed you can't have

18
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:53,970
a deadline if you have to just like

19
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:56,339
caesar and display with whatever you

20
00:00:56,339 --> 00:00:57,629
like playing with and then you actually

21
00:00:57,629 --> 00:00:59,879
come up with new stuff like the same

22
00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:02,489
thing the same way like i don't i don't

23
00:01:02,489 --> 00:01:04,769
learn from books I like I dream learn

24
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:06,570
with my hand so I have to look play with

25
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:07,950
something I work on something long

26
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:10,290
enough that it actually becomes a thing

27
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:12,570
to starting with this setup I was

28
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:14,280
playing those are the skills those of a

29
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:18,090
dragon cube I can't do a full product so

30
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:20,190
on this is the same thing same setup

31
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:26,550
then you can musical loader yeah so this

32
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:28,500
turn learn through the fool like Twitter

33
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,960
visualizations to what happens I can

34
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,030
visualize any Twitter account so I'm

35
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:37,170
life from Twitter API and I can see I

36
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:39,570
can show all the connections between any

37
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:45,120
account so i think they s dot la it

38
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:49,260
should work as well yeah so I'm with

39
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:51,990
this out strengthen videos that will

40
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:53,790
happen if we see every single follower

41
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:55,830
and we see that what happens will apply

42
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:59,760
from one to the other then place another

43
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:02,100
session playing with another titanium

44
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:04,470
another cube I was changed we had a

45
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:06,060
client called product bio we try to

46
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:08,849
visualize connection between the series

47
00:02:08,849 --> 00:02:10,289
of products and how everything is

48
00:02:10,289 --> 00:02:12,950
created to in this case you goddamn

49
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:16,080
thousands of items creating database for

50
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,709
the city and also explains here is the

51
00:02:19,709 --> 00:02:21,450
scale

52
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:25,510
so connecting this list and also one

53
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:27,670
thing I really like is a Pinterest so

54
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:29,470
I'm with this with all the sources of

55
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:34,390
fifth element with kind of anime or like

56
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:36,910
all the other references I ended up with

57
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:40,989
this project what it does again I'm

58
00:02:40,989 --> 00:02:46,480
taking them reload I'm running all live

59
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:49,500
demo so uh always a bit risky yep

60
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:53,590
aftereing it ain't happening so what I'm

61
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:56,640
taking I'm converting all the Twitter

62
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,840
Twitterverse universe whether we call it

63
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:01,959
into an infinite city using the trees

64
00:03:01,959 --> 00:03:03,610
using the system and using these

65
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:06,760
references and what I kind of like the

66
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:10,920
idea of turning a twitter handle as I

67
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:14,890
just a shoe so it's kind of tattoo it's

68
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:17,230
kind of if you think about any kind of a

69
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:19,989
God in this universe and you've got your

70
00:03:19,989 --> 00:03:22,810
followers so I'm obviously like the

71
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:25,150
bigger you get the more photos yes and

72
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:27,220
look especially right now I feel like

73
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:30,489
this is kind of rather than on top of it

74
00:03:30,489 --> 00:03:35,590
yeah it's a for infinite city so yet

75
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:40,569
i'll let see what was interesting also a

76
00:03:40,569 --> 00:03:43,450
key like I really like yes this is a few

77
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:45,190
of those resources I'm running what we

78
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:46,660
are any of the projects I made in web

79
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:49,359
deal people can step in to do with this

80
00:03:49,359 --> 00:03:51,160
one like she's actually flying through

81
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:53,459
the city to seeing it from the inside

82
00:03:53,459 --> 00:03:57,400
but what I wanted to show you is in a

83
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:00,130
way I don't make thing for them I make

84
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:04,780
tool so in this case I and also I've got

85
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:12,010
a very good I didn't plan this anyway

86
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:15,819
make him too so I i make i made a setup

87
00:04:15,819 --> 00:04:17,919
I make this system but people have to

88
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:19,479
fill it up it's kind of like interests

89
00:04:19,479 --> 00:04:21,099
of ours right now it doesn't happen

90
00:04:21,099 --> 00:04:23,590
without the person inside someone has to

91
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:26,169
trigger it and if you give people simple

92
00:04:26,169 --> 00:04:27,789
tools to make something they claim it

93
00:04:27,789 --> 00:04:29,979
like ooh look what I made the cod eyelid

94
00:04:29,979 --> 00:04:32,950
if you everyone tries to create art but

95
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:33,909
it's really hard but if you make

96
00:04:33,909 --> 00:04:34,630
something race

97
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:37,870
simple people claim it like look what

98
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:42,700
I've made to speaking of this i really

99
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:44,920
like creates more world and sometimes to

100
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,480
complete abstract sometimes the base

101
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:49,480
from the Credo location this is a really

102
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,160
fun project this will all live demos by

103
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:53,620
the way this is a this was a very fun

104
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:55,420
project for a mountain next to San

105
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,610
Francisco when we were collecting

106
00:04:57,610 --> 00:05:00,010
people's stories the people climbing can

107
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:02,110
actually leave the photos the videos

108
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:06,100
deafening speaking of stuff based on

109
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:08,530
real life I mean what everyone makes at

110
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:10,570
some point like a big skier make it at

111
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:12,670
Earth so like I really like make like

112
00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:14,080
making what I look like to destroying

113
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:18,820
them as well yeah it looks like apricot

114
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:22,840
inside I guess speaking of this around

115
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:25,090
the same time there was a nefertiti hack

116
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:30,310
to always I only the same thing I think

117
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:34,360
it looks in a bag of bread um let's see

118
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:40,170
how to enter Cristal is go online then

119
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:45,130
yeah the one thing I keep coming back to

120
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:48,700
I always put most of the stuff I'm

121
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:49,900
talking about it's going to relate to a

122
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:52,000
product I'm going to later but this is

123
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,460
like a main keys I really like making

124
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:56,590
living things so I'm for a while like

125
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:59,200
I've always trying to create some living

126
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,840
creatures living something just somehow

127
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,640
respond to you so this is 11 that

128
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:06,850
version it sees you you can see her she

129
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:08,560
sees her reflection inside as well i'm

130
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,120
using kinect amazing both camera and

131
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,220
depth camera and gestures to its

132
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:14,350
response to your gesture and sea view

133
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:15,880
and follow through so it's kind of like

134
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,740
a station acquiring you can kind of play

135
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:22,480
with him tap taking this further we had

136
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:25,270
a client called braintree and one of the

137
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:28,150
main things was did we like asking

138
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:30,550
really developers you want to be cool

139
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:33,430
and do stuff with the developers so I

140
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:35,980
serve a simple demo and then and one of

141
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:38,890
the pitch decks are so on page 7 like

142
00:06:38,890 --> 00:06:42,820
one of the screen and ideas was what if

143
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:45,729
we visualize bug bug is bug you call

144
00:06:45,729 --> 00:06:46,910
them bugs would have

145
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:49,670
what do they look like and then what if

146
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:50,990
you take a side what if you visualize

147
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:53,330
all the code as creative so what we did

148
00:06:53,330 --> 00:07:00,200
I will start looking what would a code

149
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,660
code code quickly look like what was at

150
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:04,820
generating it also have a lot of gundam

151
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:08,960
powers references variation life or it

152
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,120
is a symmetry with my movement you've

153
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,210
got different stuff and we make project

154
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:16,640
called the code ology so this is a

155
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:19,580
visual that visualizes any github repo

156
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:22,130
created so what it does I go through

157
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:25,100
projects and I find languages or use so

158
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:30,350
for example JavaScript Python c c++ d

159
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:33,350
mustard and they all create all the

160
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:35,540
different parts of this living creatures

161
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:38,030
and the some of them look like we're

162
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:40,160
spiders some of them look like a

163
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:43,940
facehugger from alien some of them are

164
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:46,850
just big monster what's really

165
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:49,460
interesting project is on github as well

166
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:52,910
so the project can visualize 3d or the

167
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:56,450
project can visualize itself also this

168
00:07:56,450 --> 00:07:59,780
bunch of like easter egg different

169
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:02,060
rendering mode different stuff um it was

170
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:04,430
really fun and again i use the same idea

171
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:07,040
than the same concepts from before so if

172
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:11,450
you go yeah if you go on Twitter it was

173
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:13,730
the same stuff people claim it like ooh

174
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:15,919
look look how I also we want a golden

175
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:19,940
lion for it who look like look how my

176
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:22,130
cold is looking look look look arise me

177
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:27,200
and it's kind of fun to like let people

178
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:31,300
create something from three much nothing

179
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:34,610
took from that actually what I mean what

180
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:37,099
if you do it high res do like I started

181
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:39,110
playing with a high-res version of

182
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:41,840
generation then um my turn the freed

183
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:44,060
crude drawings to put some drawings on

184
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:47,530
it would look like wood paper something

185
00:08:47,530 --> 00:08:50,240
then I was taking how it looks with this

186
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:54,530
a lot of lot of them the variation the

187
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:57,290
term then what are they all just fly

188
00:08:57,290 --> 00:08:59,250
through space

189
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:04,590
and again you got a load of them I use

190
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:06,810
this for music visuals for a container

191
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:09,270
and they're OK in San Francisco it makes

192
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:11,430
really good music visual things again

193
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:14,280
all JavaScript things through the how

194
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:17,990
the API all generating to the actual be

195
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:23,010
and then I sewed painting by passing

196
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:24,900
ability he's a he's actually in san

197
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:29,220
francisco and i hit him up because for

198
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:30,870
some reason i really like the scale I

199
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:33,180
relax is completed by also looking at

200
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:36,090
the migration of things on being a whole

201
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:37,920
place looking at it and with this

202
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:41,820
reference in mind I made this project to

203
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:45,150
this let me generate all the creatures

204
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:48,930
all those environments and use them

205
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:51,750
later so you can modify any of them this

206
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:53,490
infinite amount of them as well so if

207
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:55,260
you look at the white one white and

208
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:56,840
black on in the middle if i scroll down

209
00:09:56,840 --> 00:10:01,500
its grow up it doesn't exist anymore the

210
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,360
old they were all generated in one frame

211
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:07,470
their own instance and this was a really

212
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:08,790
cool website but it was about our

213
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:11,670
independent web PR came over look what

214
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:14,670
if i connect HTC vive to it so you can

215
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:17,970
do it with the controllers MVR another

216
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:19,740
the same time I start doing a lot of VR

217
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:22,050
event and then I realize we are in a

218
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:23,940
headset and the event is not refund its

219
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:25,260
separate people rather than bringing

220
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:27,839
together to water to distil touching

221
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:30,480
some positive next next out event what

222
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,000
if you bring like this the gr outside of

223
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,130
the headset so in this case you've got

224
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:36,930
multiple people that can interact with

225
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:40,430
the VR environment at the same time and

226
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:43,290
people will pretty much dancing to it

227
00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:46,440
and each like everyone everyone concrete

228
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,750
again create something play with it but

229
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:49,890
also everything is going to be saved

230
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:52,320
into 3d files the 3d printed or shared

231
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,339
online so it saves everything every

232
00:10:55,339 --> 00:10:58,730
minute and all the other objects are

233
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:04,830
available online for anyone so yeah

234
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:06,780
after this I start teaching so like I

235
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:11,230
editing web PR and I started

236
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:13,090
worships in up to 6 hours people the

237
00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:15,580
coded simple javascript stuff were

238
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:18,400
making their own beer environment and I

239
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,920
had a lot of people coming to it it was

240
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:23,890
a fun to this was some examples of what

241
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:27,370
we created in class in couple hours all

242
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:30,400
of the stuff working by oculus and

243
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:35,110
cardboard some of this looks pretty

244
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:37,990
intense but in you know you should try

245
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:39,640
stuff and you know it's just break it

246
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:42,420
and that maybe it's not better this way

247
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:44,950
this was one of my classes and there was

248
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:46,900
a time around the time that mr. Dubois

249
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:48,610
in town so he was he actually came to

250
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:50,710
the class and pretended to be one of the

251
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:54,660
students but they found out afterwards

252
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:57,340
mr. Dubey the guys created the whole 3d

253
00:11:57,340 --> 00:12:00,910
library i'm using the pjs earned the

254
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:04,210
same time ago by travis scott and i

255
00:12:04,210 --> 00:12:07,150
really like i had the contact me today

256
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:08,950
making new website and then we like

257
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:10,600
shiny stuff and I like some shiny stuff

258
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:13,510
kinda make something of a two days so I

259
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:15,820
did it in one evening but I had all the

260
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:18,180
resources from the class I was shooting

261
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:20,950
this was one of the first website for

262
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:23,590
people released he didn't know where we

263
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:27,490
are but it worse than we are and then I

264
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:30,550
started working with action later he's

265
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:33,280
an Indian artist he does a little crazy

266
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:36,700
3d and he we want to go into the movie

267
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:40,030
are spaced and yeah this is this is a

268
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:41,740
few demo tube you can check out in the

269
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:44,560
other room they're really colorful also

270
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,630
i try to step away from a low poly

271
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:49,930
system was kind of bored over to I felt

272
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:51,130
collaborations a lot of different

273
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:54,490
artists at the time and a lot of them is

274
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:56,890
getting pretty interesting to get a

275
00:12:56,890 --> 00:13:00,850
collection of different world this one's

276
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:03,490
kind of blade runner in New York it's

277
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:07,210
all rainy the rain and double check the

278
00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:10,180
rain is done by Lucas ever so I just use

279
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:13,150
the existing library but a mixed it with

280
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:15,400
VR with three days of all the stuff and

281
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:20,110
kind of good stuff fun it was November's

282
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:22,630
all training a lot of San Francisco

283
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:25,010
but yes especially after this I come to

284
00:13:25,010 --> 00:13:26,450
look at rain anymore because I kind of

285
00:13:26,450 --> 00:13:29,930
see how it's made now you shouldn't

286
00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:33,709
admit you had a pretty good run with it

287
00:13:33,709 --> 00:13:36,050
we're moving invite to a lot of

288
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:38,089
different we're actually traveling and

289
00:13:38,089 --> 00:13:42,200
traveling art exhibition came with mass

290
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,540
migration the other one with moving

291
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:47,630
invited to a centre pompidou to

292
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:50,329
festivals in brazil in serbia and couple

293
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:52,480
other places this year is going to be

294
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:55,310
playin tennis but here we're going to

295
00:13:55,310 --> 00:13:57,410
come back to somewhere to Los Angeles in

296
00:13:57,410 --> 00:14:00,529
March there's another event next arc the

297
00:14:00,529 --> 00:14:04,790
real Luke authority after this following

298
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:07,279
the ER what will set up this was them

299
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:09,769
Archie like this was the vision how

300
00:14:09,769 --> 00:14:12,410
would how we visualize an artificial

301
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:14,959
intelligence which we try to mix data

302
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:18,140
and all the kind of abstract 3d graphics

303
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:20,690
and all of the stuff again worked in VR

304
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:24,079
and it works on its own as well so I

305
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:26,570
like I polyfill through whatever device

306
00:14:26,570 --> 00:14:28,850
you have to investigate but something on

307
00:14:28,850 --> 00:14:32,060
mobile is a gyroscope and NVR is that

308
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:35,810
whole world you can walk around and then

309
00:14:35,810 --> 00:14:37,670
at some point every a sec actually do

310
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:40,520
really good projection mapping devices

311
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:44,740
do we started hacking them and uh yeah

312
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:46,910
my friends were pretty good we had a

313
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:55,010
light table for a bit oh no ah so this

314
00:14:55,010 --> 00:14:56,600
is very funny again like the predictions

315
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,160
on the side of them they don't even see

316
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,720
it so they have to improvise they will

317
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:01,610
talk to each other like now you defend

318
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:04,250
now you do something and actually from

319
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:06,199
the trick are going to work from the

320
00:15:06,199 --> 00:15:09,790
audience I'd and works really well and

321
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:12,920
here we had a few solution it's gonna be

322
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:16,370
a moving exhibition and I'm going to hit

323
00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:18,829
some festival soon as well but different

324
00:15:18,829 --> 00:15:20,329
modes different variations and we

325
00:15:20,329 --> 00:15:25,070
turning into a whole piece so speaking

326
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:27,290
of three days one political i should

327
00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:29,870
mention with obscure digital we work on

328
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:32,180
projection for election night so on

329
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:34,180
nothing if you will know that but

330
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:36,700
all this that we see the whole data that

331
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:39,190
we had live data feed JSON data feed of

332
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:42,250
whatever is actually happening and also

333
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:43,779
JavaScript so I think this was like a

334
00:15:43,779 --> 00:15:46,029
biggest canvas JavaScript read so far

335
00:15:46,029 --> 00:15:49,060
it's all running chrome or like insane

336
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:54,010
side but it was pretty well so we had a

337
00:15:54,010 --> 00:15:57,279
big as a designer set up we had done 40

338
00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:58,959
different projectors split into three

339
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:03,100
rows this was a top middle and bottom

340
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:06,580
and this this whole park is a DJ this is

341
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:10,930
all just a browser in portrait mode so

342
00:16:10,930 --> 00:16:14,050
then I started working actor working

343
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:17,230
more into intricate installation through

344
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:19,390
the huge patch screens as well to this

345
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:24,190
is again one browser split across for 4k

346
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:26,830
displays running from three different

347
00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:28,870
graphics cards on like one machine that

348
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:32,050
has for graphics cards and to process it

349
00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:36,550
and it's run its kind of crazy so

350
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:38,920
following this okay we like this wavy

351
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:40,990
stuff so I went more into the twice

352
00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:44,380
can't we just make first for Christmas

353
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:46,779
experiments I agreed we collaborated

354
00:16:46,779 --> 00:16:52,360
with john-boy Berber with this fight

355
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:56,140
with gloom and made this very thing we

356
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:58,330
like dark and gloomy I don't really like

357
00:16:58,330 --> 00:17:01,330
Christmas do it kind of hit it up a bit

358
00:17:01,330 --> 00:17:06,370
on a dark side and yeah so the last

359
00:17:06,370 --> 00:17:07,809
thing I was working on though at some

360
00:17:07,809 --> 00:17:09,939
Maggie skin is all i ever do spiders

361
00:17:09,939 --> 00:17:11,949
kind of follows you it was in VR as well

362
00:17:11,949 --> 00:17:14,679
so you can play with a pit fighter and I

363
00:17:14,679 --> 00:17:16,929
realized finally my creatures are moving

364
00:17:16,929 --> 00:17:19,030
and they finally have a character the

365
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:22,300
one this is the where I'm right now so

366
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:24,579
after the whole environment of those

367
00:17:24,579 --> 00:17:28,150
things walking and hanging out we follow

368
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:30,940
my mouth for Mac things it fully

369
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:33,490
generated the one I've got a fake

370
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:35,590
physics engine that can calculate any

371
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:41,070
number of legs between 42 and a lot and

372
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:44,230
I'm working on some tails and working on

373
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:46,670
some hands more bodies and

374
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:49,520
come here can be pretty fun and I think

375
00:17:49,520 --> 00:18:17,450
that too much it for now yep Oh which

376
00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:20,860
code would you like I think I've got the

377
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:22,850
yeah I can show you this or nothing

378
00:18:22,850 --> 00:18:25,250
about it actually it's all jealous good

379
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:29,540
so I can show you the animated think so

380
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:32,540
oh this was like the whole presentation

381
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:35,390
was at the browser window but I can show

382
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:38,380
you yeah so the one was automated cube

383
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:42,140
different all the animation happens in

384
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:46,220
two lines so I've got a simplex mode and

385
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:49,850
select know it is running on X Y Z and X

386
00:18:49,850 --> 00:18:53,630
is the position of the cube actually you

387
00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:56,510
know I can probably run it yeah so this

388
00:18:56,510 --> 00:19:02,320
is it right so if I just about this yeah

389
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:09,410
and maybe divided bar with ya so if you

390
00:19:09,410 --> 00:19:19,799
change some parameters like this one

391
00:19:19,809 --> 00:19:26,389
and maybe even quicker seizure so with

392
00:19:26,389 --> 00:19:28,789
the simplex notes you probably want to

393
00:19:28,789 --> 00:19:31,029
look x and y you can spread them around

394
00:19:31,029 --> 00:19:35,200
so for example if I cut it in like this

395
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:41,090
simpler if I cut it more into pieces now

396
00:19:41,090 --> 00:19:46,159
sideways this one is more intense and if

397
00:19:46,159 --> 00:19:47,779
I cut it even more it's just going to be

398
00:19:47,779 --> 00:19:58,850
noise and just cut this more yeah I

399
00:19:58,850 --> 00:20:04,919
think this might look kind of cool yes

400
00:20:04,929 --> 00:20:14,240
after which chief to work my phone now

401
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:21,289
oh yes it does he has all Morgan some

402
00:20:21,289 --> 00:20:23,360
setups how you can run tax quiz without

403
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,580
touch screens and with a pretty good

404
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:31,740
remote and our pocket

[Music]

408
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:43,740
the so i think i mentioned before like

409
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:47,070
why I don't like learning and like I

410
00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:48,840
don't like I don't learn from books I

411
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:50,510
don't like I can select play with it

412
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:52,800
there's an example for every single

413
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:56,940
thing part of the engine so and all the

414
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:58,410
examples also so through whatever you

415
00:20:58,410 --> 00:21:01,170
thinking of making you can find a full

416
00:21:01,170 --> 00:21:05,130
example online and you can just even if

417
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:06,450
you want to make a product is and find a

418
00:21:06,450 --> 00:21:08,130
few examples gluten together you've got

419
00:21:08,130 --> 00:21:10,530
a project but also if you want to get

420
00:21:10,530 --> 00:21:12,930
into it find something closer to what

421
00:21:12,930 --> 00:21:15,720
you think of making and play with

422
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:17,430
variable see what happens when you

423
00:21:17,430 --> 00:21:31,370
change three to three thousand

425
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:42,480
they are denying it and so mobile things

426
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,820
based on all of the every single example

427
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:47,430
you've seen it works on mobile each one

428
00:21:47,430 --> 00:21:54,150
of them and as part of its part of the

429
00:21:54,150 --> 00:21:56,880
polyfill i'm going to use so in the

430
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,680
future where we are is a placement lot

431
00:21:58,680 --> 00:21:59,910
of people different computers of

432
00:21:59,910 --> 00:22:01,680
different devices are going to eat but

433
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:03,840
they will have different capability you

434
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,550
know if you have leaked motion if you

435
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:07,110
have leap motion you've got fingers if

436
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:08,640
you don't have the motion maybe that

437
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,320
control it we don't have controllers may

438
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:13,110
be just the thing phones have read the

439
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:17,010
gyroscope to for example is actually

440
00:22:17,010 --> 00:22:19,440
considered copious multi-touch you can

441
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:24,270
use location capacity me any optimized a

442
00:22:24,270 --> 00:22:26,760
new phones are ready for we are

443
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:29,700
especially the new android phones all

444
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:32,640
the Bajan ready for a break from but

445
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:35,130
each of the examples I felt it was

446
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:38,910
iphone 4 plus and it's all for the

447
00:22:38,910 --> 00:22:49,919
browser there's no app is nothing

448
00:22:49,929 --> 00:22:54,009
um I'm using a lot of random library on

449
00:22:54,009 --> 00:22:55,659
the girls look if I need something for

450
00:22:55,659 --> 00:22:57,999
everything library so for paranoid on

451
00:22:57,999 --> 00:23:00,720
keeping library for some shader stuff

452
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,429
the greatest thing is difficult to

453
00:23:03,429 --> 00:23:07,539
contain community like I'm pretty

454
00:23:07,539 --> 00:23:10,809
confident but I'm trying to make a cube

455
00:23:10,809 --> 00:23:12,789
that's more and does something if I look

456
00:23:12,789 --> 00:23:15,100
up cube the boss and does something j/s

457
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:16,929
I'm going to find it and it's gonna be

458
00:23:16,929 --> 00:23:22,210
open so the money even the framework for

459
00:23:22,210 --> 00:23:45,129
it cube thing goes there I'm working on

460
00:23:45,129 --> 00:23:50,610
the project right now see if I can hey

461
00:23:50,610 --> 00:23:54,340
I'm working on the project with connect

462
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:58,080
so you can stream in next culliton and

463
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:01,240
I'm mapping it to bone so this last have

464
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:04,779
you seen was well for the creature they

465
00:24:04,779 --> 00:24:07,899
all running bowline system from map you

466
00:24:07,899 --> 00:24:10,299
connect bowl into the actual bones of a

467
00:24:10,299 --> 00:24:12,549
character you take over control of the

468
00:24:12,549 --> 00:24:14,799
character so you can map it easily you

469
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:16,360
can I could you know two legs and two

470
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:19,210
and two legs and two hands but maybe

471
00:24:19,210 --> 00:24:22,389
you've got two legs and the character

472
00:24:22,389 --> 00:24:27,330
edge length yeah yeah yeah

474
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:32,130
I like yeah I like making living things

475
00:24:32,130 --> 00:24:35,669
but some way to control it one way or

476
00:24:35,669 --> 00:24:38,149
the other like the restaurant directly

477
00:24:38,149 --> 00:24:40,799
don't be kind of interesting also like

478
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:44,000
out-of-body experience especially for PR

480
00:24:49,639 --> 00:24:52,740
so new VR headsets are going to have I

481
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:54,750
tracking the group they're going to have

482
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:58,529
fun while tracking so you can have you

483
00:24:58,529 --> 00:25:01,139
can smile ending dr you cannot see some

484
00:25:01,139 --> 00:25:03,720
of smiling because right now the kind of

485
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:07,190
emotionless pockets and kind of funny

486
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:10,049
yeah complete gonna be really

487
00:25:10,049 --> 00:25:14,870
interesting later
