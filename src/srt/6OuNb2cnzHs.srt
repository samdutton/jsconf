00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:19,480

all right everyone I think I'm gonna get

2
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:22,270
started with my talk now I'm glad to be

3
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:24,400
here today at JS con fan to be a

4
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:28,000
follow-up back to the beer I want to

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,340
first a just spell some misinformation

6
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:32,650
or some ignorance that was put out a

7
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:35,260
moment ago by the previous speaker he

8
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:37,420
had a moment ago up a picture of a

9
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:39,790
policeman writing a Tyrannosaurus

10
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:41,949
shooting some aliens on the moon and he

11
00:00:41,949 --> 00:00:43,059
said he didn't know where the picture

12
00:00:43,059 --> 00:00:45,670
came from I'd like to inform you that

13
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:49,089
picture comes from not from google

14
00:00:49,089 --> 00:00:51,969
closure from the stellar axe cop comic

15
00:00:51,969 --> 00:00:55,809
and I know this because I recently won a

16
00:00:55,809 --> 00:01:03,129
costume contest that is the subtly

17
00:01:03,129 --> 00:01:05,680
nuanced character Abraham Lincoln

18
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:10,060
explosion god so with that all the way

19
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:11,740
maybe i can get to my talk a little more

20
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:15,460
comfortably so to introduce myself my

21
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:18,310
name is John Davidson I work with cloud

22
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:20,050
kick which was recently acquired by

23
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:24,070
Rackspace and we do a lot of work with

24
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:25,570
servers as you might imagine racks based

25
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:27,159
as hosting cloud kick does server

26
00:01:27,159 --> 00:01:30,580
monitoring and this meant that for our

27
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:32,680
user interfaces for our web app we found

28
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:35,140
need to be displaying information that

29
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:37,270
couldn't be readily conveyed with

30
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:39,130
traditional widgets that would come kind

31
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:41,619
of baked in with the user interface

32
00:01:41,619 --> 00:01:45,340
libraries that are popular and this

33
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:47,530
includes the Google closure library

34
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:50,079
Google closure library comes with your

35
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:52,450
stock set of widgets but those were also

36
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:54,600
not what we needed you know buttons

37
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,759
sliders things like that that's not what

38
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:01,950
we needed to show things like CPU usage

39
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:04,299
complex information in a tree regarding

40
00:02:04,299 --> 00:02:06,880
the check on a system so it pushed us to

41
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,340
develop a lot of our own widgets and we

42
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:10,899
found the Google closure library was

43
00:02:10,899 --> 00:02:12,040
valuable not for the widgets it

44
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:14,110
contained but because it exposes the

45
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:15,910
framework that Google uses to create its

46
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:18,430
widgets and we followed suit and use

47
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:20,070
that framework to make some of our own

48
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:22,650
so to step back a moment

49
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:25,900
what are the globule closure tools the

50
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:27,670
library is just the first piece of them

51
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:29,530
you also have the Google closure

52
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:32,080
compiler the Google closure templates

53
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,780
and the closure linter I'm going to be

54
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:36,670
talking primarily about the library and

55
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:37,720
writing a little bit of code in the

56
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,150
library to show you what it looks like

57
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:41,320
but I find that a lot of developers

58
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:44,380
haven't taken on any programming

59
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:46,090
projects with the closure library

60
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:48,460
because there's definitely a lot to it

61
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:52,270
and can be kind of daunting let's see

62
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:54,400
and so to reference some of the things

63
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,890
that we're doing at cloud kick we do

64
00:02:56,890 --> 00:02:59,080
make use of the library the compiler the

65
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:01,900
templates but we buck the trend and we

66
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:04,360
don't need the Google closure linter

67
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:08,440
because we've got jslint and you can

68
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:13,150
deal with it okay so what do I mean when

69
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:16,470
I'm talking about some custom widgets

70
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:18,970
I'm going to bring up one of them here

71
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:20,490
and show why it's not something that's

72
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:22,360
conventional enough to be found in a

73
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:27,010
regular library if I can remember the

74
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:32,650
hotkeys oops there we go this is one

75
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:35,020
that I wrote and its function isn't

76
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:36,910
readily apparent when you look at it

77
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:40,150
right here but if you see it on a page

78
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:42,130
it makes a little more sense what you

79
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:45,010
have around here are the place is ready

80
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:46,750
to have some check on your system you

81
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:49,570
this instead of being d would be SSH see

82
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:51,520
would be paying you could have memory

83
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,590
you could have any custom checks that

84
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:55,330
you've set up on your own system they

85
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:56,650
could run on your side and the report

86
00:03:56,650 --> 00:04:00,430
back to F this widget is ignorant of all

87
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:02,140
that in meaning and it's just about

88
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:05,110
displaying what you have so maybe you've

89
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:06,460
got some kind of aggregates of those

90
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:09,400
data you wanted to select one of the

91
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:12,040
subgroups of it I won't dwell on it but

92
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:12,850
you can see that something

93
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:14,320
unconventional is the kind of thing

94
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,640
where you'd like to be able to define

95
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,739
behavior exactly on your own terms and

96
00:04:17,739 --> 00:04:24,600
not have to settle for something else

97
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:28,130
okay so before I start on that I'm going

98
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:30,770
to introduce you to the parent for the

99
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:32,030
classes i'm going to create which is the

100
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:35,060
google uicomponent the Goo Goo I

101
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:37,880
component it inherits from its

102
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:40,160
grandparent the disposable which imbues

103
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,810
it with some properties that give it a

104
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:45,350
life cycle where you enter into the

105
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:46,970
memory subsequently you can enter into

106
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:49,580
the Dom itself exiting the Dom maybe to

107
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:51,880
return maybe not and then be disposed

108
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:54,470
there's an event framework that gets put

109
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:58,150
in with google event target and then

110
00:04:58,150 --> 00:05:00,380
finally there's the glue I component

111
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:02,090
that works in a lot of the helper

112
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:03,350
functions that you'll find in the

113
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:10,220
widgets in the widgets themselves all

114
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:14,000
right so widget lifecycle there's a

115
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,950
pretty important concept and what made

116
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:17,690
this frame were pretty valuable to us

117
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:21,350
the image on the right demonstrates the

118
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:23,240
paths that a widget can take in its life

119
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,830
cycle we're only going to be focusing on

120
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:25,730
one of them but i'm going to introduce

121
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:29,000
them here just because it's an important

122
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,940
concept to understand if you start from

123
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:33,800
the instantiated widget over there you

124
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,810
have the render path the decorate path

125
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:38,750
and disposed path the render path is one

126
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:39,980
where you would say I have a target

127
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:42,110
where I want to place this widget and it

128
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:45,500
will let me see if I can gesture this

129
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:48,800
it'll execute create Dom and Inter

130
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,380
document on its own and that means is

131
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:54,530
going to create its own dumb it's going

132
00:05:54,530 --> 00:05:55,880
to do the functions that you've defined

133
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:58,100
an enter document to enter the document

134
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:00,740
and that point is displayed the user is

135
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:02,060
looking at it the user can interact with

136
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:05,690
it the user can see it the similar path

137
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:08,270
that's not as useful to us is decorate

138
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:10,940
if that Dom element already existed you

139
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:14,390
could take your widget and just attach

140
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:16,190
all of its events and handlers to the

141
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:19,010
existing Dom element but because our

142
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:22,700
apps are usually HTML generated by

143
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:24,919
JavaScript we don't find ourselves as

144
00:06:24,919 --> 00:06:26,810
frequently needing some other part of

145
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:28,370
our JavaScript to prakrit creating the

146
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:29,840
widgets it makes more sense for us to

147
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:33,020
just encapsulate that inside the Goo Goo

148
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:34,789
I component itself and use the render

149
00:06:34,789 --> 00:06:35,389
path

150
00:06:35,389 --> 00:06:37,469
disposed over here is just if you were

151
00:06:37,469 --> 00:06:39,300
to create a widget and say it was

152
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:40,589
supposed to be ready for some view that

153
00:06:40,589 --> 00:06:42,749
popped in but the user never used it so

154
00:06:42,749 --> 00:06:44,659
you just dispose of it when you're done

155
00:06:44,659 --> 00:06:47,879
and over here we have some of the

156
00:06:47,879 --> 00:06:49,169
functions and I'm going to be explaining

157
00:06:49,169 --> 00:06:50,399
to you momentarily when I walk through

158
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:54,719
the creation of a widget itself so this

159
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:56,999
is a simplified widget lifecycle to get

160
00:06:56,999 --> 00:06:58,409
rid of the other pads is the one that

161
00:06:58,409 --> 00:06:59,819
we're going to be taking for the demo in

162
00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:02,689
a moment we're going to be instantiating

163
00:07:02,689 --> 00:07:05,009
rendering and disposing are the

164
00:07:05,009 --> 00:07:06,209
functions that we're going to be calling

165
00:07:06,209 --> 00:07:07,769
and in the background that's going to

166
00:07:07,769 --> 00:07:10,319
hit create Dom inter document and then

167
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:12,240
way to dispose it's going to hit exit

168
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:16,830
document and dispose internal okay so i

169
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:17,999
thought the widget that i work on today

170
00:07:17,999 --> 00:07:20,669
is something that you see on sites like

171
00:07:20,669 --> 00:07:22,589
eBay or a lot of sales sighs I think

172
00:07:22,589 --> 00:07:24,869
woot has something similar it's this

173
00:07:24,869 --> 00:07:27,209
little countdown I would call this a

174
00:07:27,209 --> 00:07:30,019
pretty simple widget where it's

175
00:07:30,019 --> 00:07:32,519
displaying some number of seconds and

176
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:34,259
it's updating itself and it's telling

177
00:07:34,259 --> 00:07:35,610
you that you better buy something fast

178
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:41,939
because time is running out so before I

179
00:07:41,939 --> 00:07:43,439
do that I have to show a little bit

180
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:44,849
about how the class system works in

181
00:07:44,849 --> 00:07:48,509
google closure the two important ones to

182
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:50,339
know strap the bat or goog provide and

183
00:07:50,339 --> 00:07:52,589
goog require good provide is how when

184
00:07:52,589 --> 00:07:54,419
you make a file you say this is what I'm

185
00:07:54,419 --> 00:07:56,729
providing in this file if other files

186
00:07:56,729 --> 00:07:58,499
are wanting to require it this is the

187
00:07:58,499 --> 00:08:02,149
namespace it should be addressed by &

188
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:05,519
goo require is how you request that file

189
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:08,729
so for example the opening part of the

190
00:08:08,729 --> 00:08:10,319
event target object that I talked about

191
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:13,469
earlier opens with guude provide and

192
00:08:13,469 --> 00:08:15,209
then it gives out in string what its

193
00:08:15,209 --> 00:08:18,300
name is gugak wire and it takes the two

194
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:20,639
things that then get incorporated in

195
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:24,479
during the file what we're going to be

196
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:26,339
doing here is kind of a bad example but

197
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:27,779
because we're doing a bad example I'm

198
00:08:27,779 --> 00:08:29,519
going to put the warning in when you use

199
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:31,860
goog require the way it includes the

200
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:34,860
code is by taking what you've asked for

201
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:37,500
and generating a script tag that's

202
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,959
appropriate so if you wanted to use

203
00:08:39,959 --> 00:08:43,289
goood UI button as we do here you would

204
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:45,329
have to use you'd have to have the

205
00:08:45,329 --> 00:08:47,170
require statement in

206
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:49,240
separate set of tags to make sure that

207
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:53,110
it's inserted script tag gets executed

208
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:55,149
before you get to the next block if we

209
00:08:55,149 --> 00:08:56,380
were to combine those two we would get

210
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:58,480
an error that says that goo goo I button

211
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:08,589
doesn't exist yet ok that is there we go

212
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:12,279
so let me bring up the stub of what

213
00:09:12,279 --> 00:09:17,470
we're going to be working with I've

214
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:19,079
cheated a little bit in that I have

215
00:09:19,079 --> 00:09:22,870
already created the file that we're

216
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:28,870
going to be using and I can't spell

217
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:34,329
evidently courtesy of the beer okay so

218
00:09:34,329 --> 00:09:35,470
I've stubbed this out on the functions

219
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:37,510
that we're interested in and I put the

220
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:38,649
two dudes in each place where we're

221
00:09:38,649 --> 00:09:39,880
going to have to be implementing it

222
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:42,550
ourselves the first thing we don't know

223
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:44,829
I'm going to go through all of these all

224
00:09:44,829 --> 00:09:46,810
the way and the interest of time but I

225
00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:51,710
can go through a few of the obvious ones

226
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:54,190
let's see here I'm going to angle this a

227
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:58,599
bit so I can see better

228
00:09:58,609 --> 00:10:00,539
so right there we have that we need to

229
00:10:00,539 --> 00:10:02,039
add our group provide a new require

230
00:10:02,039 --> 00:10:11,869
statements simple enough we're going to

231
00:10:11,869 --> 00:10:20,309
require the component actually this is

232
00:10:20,309 --> 00:10:21,899
moving significantly slower than I

233
00:10:21,899 --> 00:10:28,979
thought it would we've got timers

234
00:10:28,979 --> 00:10:41,059
another one that we would want and goons

235
00:10:41,059 --> 00:10:42,929
because we're going to be doing a little

236
00:10:42,929 --> 00:10:47,009
bit of event handling and I will stretch

237
00:10:47,009 --> 00:10:50,970
for the it in the goog provide we're

238
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:52,319
just going to call this one countdown

239
00:10:52,319 --> 00:10:54,419
which is later we refer to this class as

240
00:10:54,419 --> 00:10:59,309
which is to come down and actually in

241
00:10:59,309 --> 00:11:04,799
the interest of time feel like this is a

242
00:11:04,799 --> 00:11:08,069
cooking show all of a sudden but I have

243
00:11:08,069 --> 00:11:14,909
something that I baked earlier is that

244
00:11:14,909 --> 00:11:26,009
visible no excellent okay

245
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:31,360
visible ish now how we doing we're going

246
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,059
to work that for a second so let me show

247
00:11:34,059 --> 00:11:35,290
you how I filled this out on my own

248
00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:38,920
earlier I decided that we wanted to pass

249
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,389
in in the constructor here the first

250
00:11:40,389 --> 00:11:42,160
part we need to know the time remaining

251
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,529
we need to have a timer and we need to

252
00:11:44,529 --> 00:11:46,089
start that timer we're listening for

253
00:11:46,089 --> 00:11:48,369
ticks on the timer and every time we

254
00:11:48,369 --> 00:11:50,049
have a tick we're going to handle the

255
00:11:50,049 --> 00:11:55,689
tick which is just going to decrement

256
00:11:55,689 --> 00:11:57,939
the time that we have remaining the

257
00:11:57,939 --> 00:12:00,610
appropriate amount for what the interval

258
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:02,259
is set to I think presently the interval

259
00:12:02,259 --> 00:12:06,819
is set to one second and at that point

260
00:12:06,819 --> 00:12:08,559
we refresh the content which just sets

261
00:12:08,559 --> 00:12:10,480
the number of seconds into the element

262
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,939
itself and those are the kind of inner

263
00:12:12,939 --> 00:12:14,379
working parts but let me show you how I

264
00:12:14,379 --> 00:12:17,679
filled out the behind the scene step

265
00:12:17,679 --> 00:12:22,959
that create down etc so enter document

266
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:25,299
all we had to do here we took advantage

267
00:12:25,299 --> 00:12:28,149
of the event the event handler that

268
00:12:28,149 --> 00:12:30,639
comes built in and the advantage of

269
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:32,170
using the event handler that comes built

270
00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:33,970
in with this widget as opposed to using

271
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:37,990
our own listen calls is that the event

272
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:39,339
handler that comes with the widget is

273
00:12:39,339 --> 00:12:41,589
coterminous with the widget so anytime

274
00:12:41,589 --> 00:12:45,730
we set a bunch of listeners on this when

275
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:47,499
we finally go to dispose or we go to

276
00:12:47,499 --> 00:12:49,569
exit document actually it's going to

277
00:12:49,569 --> 00:12:52,809
remove those listeners automatically so

278
00:12:52,809 --> 00:12:54,879
I think I had it just like console

279
00:12:54,879 --> 00:12:56,290
logging because I wanted to set

280
00:12:56,290 --> 00:12:57,309
something here I couldn't really think

281
00:12:57,309 --> 00:13:02,939
of anything to put in disposed internal

282
00:13:02,939 --> 00:13:04,899
because everything else was already

283
00:13:04,899 --> 00:13:07,329
handled for us and the super classes

284
00:13:07,329 --> 00:13:08,919
disposed internal the only thing I

285
00:13:08,919 --> 00:13:10,269
really need to get rid of was that timer

286
00:13:10,269 --> 00:13:15,999
that I created initially and let me see

287
00:13:15,999 --> 00:13:19,350
if I have it in here

288
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:27,300
I think I oh that's right I was going to

289
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:30,600
put an exit document statement as well

290
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,520
but it turns out that because things

291
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,690
were handled for me I didn't even need

292
00:13:33,690 --> 00:13:35,820
to author one so as you can see it's a

293
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:37,260
pretty simple function but it's pretty

294
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:40,500
simple to get it to fit into the

295
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:44,250
framework of Google closure itself and

296
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:51,840
evidently I changed something so let me

297
00:13:51,840 --> 00:14:00,390
open that demo we have a moment first I

298
00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:06,430
have to correct some JavaScript a moment

299
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:08,540
oh and you'll see that i included cheat

300
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:10,880
up there what she does is it goog

301
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:14,180
requires the component beforehand

302
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:15,740
because like I said you need to have

303
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:17,900
that required earlier for the way that

304
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:20,420
this is working at the moment because

305
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:22,760
this isn't bundled together if you have

306
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,380
this actually in production you would be

307
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:25,640
bundling this together and I'm actually

308
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:27,680
going to reference at the end of this

309
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,300
some of the better ways to package this

310
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:31,220
someone i've done i've literally shown

311
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:33,230
you the worst possible way to use google

312
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:51,359
closure today thank you let's see here

313
00:14:51,369 --> 00:14:54,829
okay and if this works as expected I had

314
00:14:54,829 --> 00:14:56,720
set a listener on this button which is a

315
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:57,920
regular button it's not a witch or

316
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,449
anything and this should take the

317
00:14:59,449 --> 00:15:02,179
already created widget and render it

318
00:15:02,179 --> 00:15:09,139
into the page Oh lovely thank you I'm

319
00:15:09,139 --> 00:15:13,730
here all week something has no method

320
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:19,580
inherits

321
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:26,750
oh I guess I didn't

322
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:36,020
oh that's right I didn't fix this

323
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:47,030
okay one more try

324
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,870
if this doesn't work I'm going to have

325
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:50,639
to take it on a good faith because okay

326
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:52,889
so you notice it started at 27 there I

327
00:15:52,889 --> 00:15:55,139
haven't counting off from the moment it

328
00:15:55,139 --> 00:15:56,430
was created which was three seconds

329
00:15:56,430 --> 00:15:59,370
before that and it had already been

330
00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:00,990
counting because it existed in the

331
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:02,459
background and when we hit rendered as

332
00:16:02,459 --> 00:16:04,310
when is actually entered into the Dom I

333
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:06,750
had a listener so that when your mousing

334
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:08,970
over it it tells you how many seconds it

335
00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:10,680
has in milliseconds and it's spitting

336
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:12,899
that out at the bottom I'm going to wait

337
00:16:12,899 --> 00:16:14,250
a second because i also have it waiting

338
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:16,019
for a change event that it dispatches on

339
00:16:16,019 --> 00:16:19,800
itself and yep dang we missed it is the

340
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,509
listener that we had on that putting

341
00:16:21,509 --> 00:16:23,940
that in and out was one line on an

342
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:25,500
existing Google library which made it

343
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,839
pretty easy as well and then we can

344
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:30,389
dispose of it at the end and we don't

345
00:16:30,389 --> 00:16:32,759
have to worry about any of those events

346
00:16:32,759 --> 00:16:34,350
or objects that we've created in the

347
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:36,029
meantime because it takes care of it

348
00:16:36,029 --> 00:16:38,490
this is a really simple example but it

349
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:40,259
was also really simple to create which

350
00:16:40,259 --> 00:16:47,480
was the beauty of it okay

351
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:50,460
I'm going to skip this a moment suffice

352
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:51,930
to say that this was simple but there's

353
00:16:51,930 --> 00:16:54,360
actually a better way to do really great

354
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:56,760
widgets than what we've done here if you

355
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:57,840
want to have a widget that multiple

356
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,670
different representations this only has

357
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:01,470
one create Dom you could theoretically

358
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:03,030
hook it up to a series of different

359
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:04,800
create Dom's for looking one way in one

360
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:07,920
page one way in another so how good was

361
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,630
our deployment for this it was actually

362
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:13,020
pretty terrible it was the least optimal

363
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:18,750
way to do this of all of them oh there

364
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:21,360
we go every time we have the goog

365
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:23,010
require in live code it's just putting

366
00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:24,930
in script tags which means more requests

367
00:17:24,930 --> 00:17:26,400
and requests and requests and requests

368
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,500
on top of requests so that's slow it

369
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:29,730
means that the code that you're pulling

370
00:17:29,730 --> 00:17:33,510
down is undefined it's uncompelled which

371
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:36,000
is slow not just for the time to pull it

372
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,590
down the time to parse it but also the

373
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:40,170
time to execute it so the ways to make

374
00:17:40,170 --> 00:17:42,870
it better then this example would have

375
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:44,820
been instead of taking raw code which is

376
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:47,190
tons of requests it's not minified not

377
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:49,080
optimized we could have done bundle it

378
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:50,430
there's a script that comes with Google

379
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:51,900
closure that would have done this for us

380
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:53,670
in one line we could have served it up

381
00:17:53,670 --> 00:17:56,220
it'd still be a fairly large file even

382
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:59,070
for pretty simple things so if you were

383
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:00,720
to minimize it and use the simple

384
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,220
compilation from the google closure

385
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:04,020
compiler this would have put you in a

386
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:06,870
better situation but if you're feeling

387
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:08,490
particularly adventurous you could use

388
00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:10,620
the Google closure advanced compilation

389
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:12,480
and that'll give you code that looks

390
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:15,540
something like this which can be fun to

391
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:19,020
debug I'll tell you but otherwise it's

392
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:21,540
really a pleasure to work with in terms

393
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:24,630
of speed of execution and the

394
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:28,620
downloading um so I think I'm just with

395
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:32,070
in time for my demonstration today and I

396
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:33,900
thank you all for your attention did we

397
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:35,730
have any questions about google closure

398
00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:38,400
library in general or about widgets in

399
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,900
particular I've spent most of my time

400
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:42,540
working with the widgets library but

401
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:44,910
I've also done a bit else so I've got

402
00:18:44,910 --> 00:18:47,250
some experience over there the question

403
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:48,990
was if I'd done anything with mobile

404
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:51,870
applications no I've not actually for

405
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:53,910
the particular app that we do a cloud

406
00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:55,890
kick I'm on the front end for our web

407
00:18:55,890 --> 00:18:57,480
app team and we'd consider doing a

408
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:59,380
mobile version

409
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:02,200
of the site for a bit but presently

410
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,330
we've just hired on someone that's

411
00:19:04,330 --> 00:19:07,960
actually doing native android and iphone

412
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:10,060
apps for cloud kick I think we actually

413
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:12,490
have both already but he's really

414
00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:14,950
improving them so that's not the highest

415
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:16,660
priority as far as the mobile platforms

416
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:18,340
concerned for the mobile platform we're

417
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:20,590
pursuing the native apps at the moment

418
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:23,260
have you worked with it for mobile or

419
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:33,800
was it interesting

420
00:19:33,810 --> 00:19:39,520
style

421
00:19:39,530 --> 00:19:42,090
right if you're talking are you talking

422
00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:46,940
to nate aviron seeeeee ok so for

423
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:49,140
appearance i think the task you would

424
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:51,860
have there is just to take the existing

425
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:54,870
widgets and write new renderers for them

426
00:19:54,870 --> 00:20:00,360
which isn't entirely trivial so yes if

427
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:01,559
you're looking for something that looks

428
00:20:01,559 --> 00:20:04,290
entirely like an iPhone app you're

429
00:20:04,290 --> 00:20:05,370
probably looking at something like

430
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:09,299
sencha and if there aren't any more

431
00:20:09,299 --> 00:20:11,460
questions I thank you very your time and
