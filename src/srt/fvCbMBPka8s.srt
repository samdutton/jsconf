00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,370

oh my god

2
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:05,970
[Applause]

3
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:07,780
[Music]

4
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:10,719
[Applause]

5
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:15,709
my name is Dennis and I have a problem

6
00:00:15,709 --> 00:00:18,910
though I'm not an anonymous alcoholic

7
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:22,369
and let's make it clear from the start

8
00:00:22,369 --> 00:00:24,230
I'm not even public alcoholic I nearly

9
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:31,180
don't drink my problem is different I'm

10
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:35,600
I'm a developer there are a lot of

11
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,860
questions without answers in my head why

12
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:42,080
do we calculate padding's based on

13
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:44,120
parents width even for top and bottom

14
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:48,769
values I don't know what do peak angular

15
00:00:48,769 --> 00:00:52,100
or react polymer or View vanilla GS or

16
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:53,390
mean GS with chocolate chips

17
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:58,160
I don't know now when we are writing CSS

18
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,920
and JavaScript is at the time to make it

19
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:03,230
even and starts writing javascript and

20
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:07,580
HTML and CSS I don't know there are many

21
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:10,360
more questions that I have no answer to

22
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:13,670
exactly they did C won't be covered in

23
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:16,460
this talk today instead I want to talk

24
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:21,190
to you about us us as human beings us as

25
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:25,580
developers we developers are all very

26
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:26,240
different

27
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:29,060
some like CSS others prefer playing with

28
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:31,550
the latest JavaScript framework some

29
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:33,830
like aesthetics and house enjoy a

30
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:35,240
skillfully designed websites

31
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:37,250
others prefer building unique user

32
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:38,950
experience all the way from the ground

33
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:41,479
but no matter our differences there is

34
00:01:41,479 --> 00:01:44,450
one thing we all share in common we all

35
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:47,630
want to be professionally successful in

36
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:50,270
whatever we are doing and the wish to be

37
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:52,910
successful to be the best is not bad at

38
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:53,360
all

39
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,000
this is how evolution works the problem

40
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,039
is that a lot of people take this wish

41
00:01:58,039 --> 00:02:00,560
to become successful way too serious

42
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:06,349
in 1982 physician Robert Goldman post a

43
00:02:06,349 --> 00:02:08,450
question to elite athletes in power and

44
00:02:08,450 --> 00:02:12,349
combat sports asking if I had a magic

45
00:02:12,349 --> 00:02:15,709
drug that would be so fantastic that if

46
00:02:15,709 --> 00:02:18,560
you take it once you would win every

47
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,920
competition you would enter from mr.

48
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,690
Olympia to Olympic decathlon for the

49
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:26,180
next five years but it would have one

50
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:34,280
minor drawback it would kill you five

51
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,140
years after you took it would you still

52
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:42,350
take this pill I'm sorry the problem is

53
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:44,040
that more than half

54
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,530
the respondents answered yes they would

55
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:49,260
still take this bill puzzled with this

56
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:50,909
result goldman repeated the same

57
00:02:50,909 --> 00:02:53,159
question for the following 13 years

58
00:02:53,159 --> 00:02:56,549
until 1995 and during all these years

59
00:02:56,549 --> 00:02:58,680
the results were consistent people were

60
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,510
willing to trade their lives for just

61
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:05,129
five years of success we developers of

62
00:03:05,129 --> 00:03:07,439
course are not athletes frankly a lot of

63
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:09,269
us are as far from sports as is possibly

64
00:03:09,269 --> 00:03:17,310
could be and thankfully this bill

65
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:20,609
doesn't exist so we all have to find our

66
00:03:20,609 --> 00:03:26,760
own way to professional success but no

67
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:29,310
matter whether we are different and

68
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:31,859
whether we take different paths on this

69
00:03:31,859 --> 00:03:34,680
path to professional success we all face

70
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:37,739
the same problems and exactly about

71
00:03:37,739 --> 00:03:39,209
those problems I would like to talk to

72
00:03:39,209 --> 00:03:41,609
you today we'll try to see what those

73
00:03:41,609 --> 00:03:42,180
are

74
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:43,919
we'll try to analyze them and hopefully

75
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:46,349
we'll try to see what we can to do about

76
00:03:46,349 --> 00:03:53,090
those a lot of modern physicists

77
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:55,290
sincerely believe that the world around

78
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:57,419
us is nothing more than just huge

79
00:03:57,419 --> 00:03:59,129
computer simulations so we all live in

80
00:03:59,129 --> 00:04:01,019
matrix so for the purpose of this talk

81
00:04:01,019 --> 00:04:04,169
let's assume this is true so let's

82
00:04:04,169 --> 00:04:07,169
imagine and think how would an average

83
00:04:07,169 --> 00:04:10,079
developer could look like in the form of

84
00:04:10,079 --> 00:04:14,549
let's say a JavaScript program it all

85
00:04:14,549 --> 00:04:18,810
starts here we are born and raised and

86
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:20,699
at some point we get to the first hour

87
00:04:20,699 --> 00:04:24,120
our first milestone as developers we

88
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,099
read our first book in my case it was

89
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:28,289
it's really hard to see here but in my

90
00:04:28,289 --> 00:04:30,120
case it was designing with web standards

91
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,039
by Jeffrey Zeldin the first edition of

92
00:04:32,039 --> 00:04:34,380
this book you enjoy the book and you

93
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:36,120
want to apply this new knowledge so you

94
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,490
get into your first project probably for

95
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:40,080
yourself or for a friend

96
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,699
probably it was rubbish and probably you

97
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:44,400
didn't get paid but you really enjoyed

98
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,849
the moment and the idea that you can

99
00:04:47,849 --> 00:04:49,530
create something once and it will be

100
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:51,780
instantly available for millions use of

101
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:54,210
the users around the world so you want

102
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:56,789
to go on and you get to your first job

103
00:04:56,789 --> 00:04:57,870
as a develop

104
00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:00,480
and things go on and on and on and on

105
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:03,300
until something goes wrong take a look

106
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:08,430
at the console the program representing

107
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:11,180
us as developers starts throwing errors

108
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:13,770
let's take a look at what those problems

109
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:16,650
are there are only three here for the

110
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:18,450
purpose of this talk there are many more

111
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:19,830
but exactly what these three we are

112
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:21,780
going to talk about today so the first

113
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:29,430
one is perfectionism next slide I will

114
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:31,410
just show you some pictures I'm not

115
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:33,090
gonna say word I'm interested in your

116
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:45,540
reaction to those I will let this one to

117
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:50,910
stay on the screen for a while of course

118
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:52,890
this is not a scientific research but

119
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:55,350
from your reaction I might consider that

120
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:58,370
some of you consider yourselves

121
00:05:58,370 --> 00:05:59,520
perfectionists

122
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:03,180
I remember in 2013 when I company I was

123
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:04,860
working out back then was about to merge

124
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:06,480
with another company I had a

125
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:09,480
conversation with my background boss

126
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:12,330
about how this merge might affect my

127
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:13,440
style of work

128
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:17,520
danny's he said your style of work is

129
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,850
like champagne it's long processed well

130
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:24,810
thought and expensive the style of a

131
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:27,210
company we are about to merge is more

132
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:31,040
like a Prosecco it's faster it's

133
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:34,020
probably cheaper and probably less

134
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:36,660
quality lower quality we both know that

135
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:39,930
but when both drinks are poured in the

136
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:41,910
glasses at a party most people won't

137
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:45,360
tell the difference anyway even though

138
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,980
later this company decided that their

139
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:48,840
front-end works on the unicorn sparking

140
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,190
magic and they don't need in-house

141
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:52,620
front-end developer at all I still

142
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:55,470
remember this dialogue as a good example

143
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:57,780
of how the work of perfectionist and non

144
00:06:57,780 --> 00:06:59,850
perfectionist is perceived by normal

145
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:01,830
people and yes I used to think about

146
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:04,530
myself as perfectionist but what do we

147
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:06,090
want it or not perfectionists are a

148
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:07,590
completely different breed when it comes

149
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:10,780
to work long perfectionists

150
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:14,350
consider work to be just that when it

151
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:17,350
comes to perfectionists we consider work

152
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:20,860
a challenge we consider it as a way of

153
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:22,480
expressing ourselves and challenge

154
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:24,820
ourselves there is an approach

155
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:28,360
all-or-nothing in our work we do not pay

156
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,580
attention to deadlines to any obstacles

157
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:34,970
before we get to this perfect result

158
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:37,990
there is no room for mistake in the work

159
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:41,500
of perfectionist so we do anything we

160
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:44,230
can to avoid even slightest hint to

161
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:45,880
criticism because criticism is the worst

162
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,020
enemy of perfectionist

163
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:48,430
and when the work is done according to

164
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:50,530
how perfectionist intended it to be this

165
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:52,950
working truly shine so why exactly

166
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:56,230
perfectionism is marked as a bug in our

167
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:58,600
program don't get me wrong

168
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:02,740
perfectionism is really good for example

169
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:07,780
it's great when like yes the problem

170
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:09,400
with perfectionism is that there are two

171
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,320
different types of perfectionism

172
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:13,930
according to modern psychology there is

173
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:15,669
positive perfectionism or healthy

174
00:08:15,669 --> 00:08:17,620
perfections and there is negative

175
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:21,070
perfectionism so positive perfectionism

176
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:23,320
is the moving force for of a lot of

177
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,030
industries because it helps you achieve

178
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:26,919
outstanding results in whatever you have

179
00:08:26,919 --> 00:08:31,360
passion for it's wonderful for example

180
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,190
when your dentist is perfectionist or an

181
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:34,510
architect that built a house you're

182
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:37,030
living in or it's really great that

183
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:38,950
Steve Jobs was such a perfectionist that

184
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:41,770
with his attitude to perfectionism to be

185
00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:43,930
perfecting things he set the bar for the

186
00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:47,380
whole industry but there is a pattern

187
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:50,290
here perfectionism is always good when

188
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:53,350
you are a consumer believe it or not

189
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:56,170
when you create things perfectionism can

190
00:08:56,170 --> 00:08:59,410
really stand in your way the same Steve

191
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:00,640
Jobs as classical example of

192
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,130
perfectionists was really hard to work

193
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:06,040
with in 1977 when he was working on his

194
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:09,339
new Apple 2 computer he had to pick the

195
00:09:09,339 --> 00:09:12,339
color casing of this computer and the

196
00:09:12,339 --> 00:09:14,950
Pantone company sent him two thousand

197
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:16,480
shades of beige to pick from

198
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:19,890
not two not 20 not two hundred two

199
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:23,589
thousand shades of beige now we're good

200
00:09:23,589 --> 00:09:24,630
enough for Steve Jobs

201
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:27,420
so he was desperately willing to develop

202
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:29,970
his perfect beige color for his perfect

203
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:31,800
computer he was so obsessed with this

204
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:34,259
idea that Michael Scott CEO of Apple

205
00:09:34,259 --> 00:09:36,569
back then had to interfere and stop jobs

206
00:09:36,569 --> 00:09:40,860
from doing that negative perfectionism

207
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:44,160
can make people really aggressive when

208
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,290
somebody challenges their ideas or the

209
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:48,810
way they work I will show you a short

210
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:50,970
clip from a sitcom Silicon Valley that

211
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:53,160
most probably you are familiar with but

212
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,930
it nicely illustrates the problem that

213
00:09:54,930 --> 00:10:08,000
I'm talking about sure what's wrong

214
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:18,249
nothing nothing literally it's all good

215
00:10:18,259 --> 00:10:21,329
right you really hate space no no no no

216
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:23,040
I don't it's not hate hates a strong

217
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:23,459
word

218
00:10:23,459 --> 00:10:26,670
um truth be told I do have a slight

219
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:28,350
preference for tabs but that's only

220
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:31,699
because I'm anal and because I prefer

221
00:10:31,699 --> 00:10:37,319
precision well not to pick a fight here

222
00:10:37,319 --> 00:10:39,449
but if you really care about precision

223
00:10:39,449 --> 00:10:43,259
when you use spaces but whatever once it

224
00:10:43,259 --> 00:10:44,550
goes through the compiler it's the same

225
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:51,150
thing right yeah yeah technically yes

226
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:56,440
I guess I just I just don't understand

227
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,720
why you anyone use spaces over tabs like

228
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,819
if it's all the same or why not just use

229
00:11:00,819 --> 00:11:03,009
tabs because it could look different on

230
00:11:03,009 --> 00:11:04,779
other people's computers tabs create

231
00:11:04,779 --> 00:11:07,089
smaller file sizes alright I run a

232
00:11:07,089 --> 00:11:08,529
compression company trust me I've

233
00:11:08,529 --> 00:11:10,180
devoted my life to minimalizing file

234
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:13,029
sizes it's what I do I mean I do not get

235
00:11:13,029 --> 00:11:16,389
why anyone would use spaces over tabs I

236
00:11:16,389 --> 00:11:18,550
mean why not just use vim over Emacs I

237
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:25,480
do use vim / Emacs oh god help us so

238
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:31,480
it's funny right but in addition to

239
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,879
affecting our personal life negative

240
00:11:33,879 --> 00:11:37,360
perfectionism can have real effect on

241
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:40,750
our work life and it can take different

242
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:45,129
forms in our day to day job but we are

243
00:11:45,129 --> 00:11:47,079
gonna talk about the most common ones

244
00:11:47,079 --> 00:11:49,959
the first one is called perfectionist

245
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:52,990
paralysis we all know what is

246
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:57,040
procrastination aren't we the problem is

247
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,990
that different people procrastinate due

248
00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:01,389
to different reasons some are just tired

249
00:12:01,389 --> 00:12:05,399
some want to make the mental shift but

250
00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:07,810
perfectionists procrastinate because

251
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:10,689
they are waiting for an ideal moment to

252
00:12:10,689 --> 00:12:13,139
start working on their ideal project

253
00:12:13,139 --> 00:12:15,699
well at least that's how perfectionists

254
00:12:15,699 --> 00:12:18,360
think about this process in reality

255
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:21,939
perfectionists just afraid of not

256
00:12:21,939 --> 00:12:23,860
achieving perfect result after all it's

257
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:28,899
the fear of failure they try to think

258
00:12:28,899 --> 00:12:32,110
about not existing problems every task

259
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:34,949
they're working with this over complete

260
00:12:34,949 --> 00:12:36,069
overcomplicates

261
00:12:36,069 --> 00:12:38,589
even slide even smallest tasks and

262
00:12:38,589 --> 00:12:40,689
naturally enough perfectionist needs

263
00:12:40,689 --> 00:12:42,639
some time and some strength to fight

264
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:44,559
this huge monster that eats their time

265
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:48,399
and resources but let's assume that in

266
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:49,990
reality this ideal moment never comes

267
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:51,759
before it's too late right but let's

268
00:12:51,759 --> 00:12:54,910
assume that miracles happen and you've

269
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:57,069
got your ideal moment so you start

270
00:12:57,069 --> 00:12:58,990
working on the brush I'm sorry on a

271
00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:01,240
project or simply a deadline is knocking

272
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:03,309
at your door and you have to start so

273
00:13:03,309 --> 00:13:04,300
you

274
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:06,100
start this and then you get into the

275
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:08,110
next problem of negative perfectionism

276
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:13,120
that is called picking a detail so they

277
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,100
wish to finish every task perfectionist

278
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:18,040
works with necessarily with perfect

279
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:20,590
result leads them to pick really small

280
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:22,600
tasks that they would be guaranteed to

281
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:25,720
finish with perfect result but while

282
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,060
working with these small tasks

283
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:29,500
perfectionists dive so deep in this task

284
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,330
that they completely lose overview of a

285
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:33,580
project that still lives around this

286
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:39,130
small task again let's assume that you

287
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:41,350
have perfect project manager who is

288
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:42,790
familiar with your style and reminds you

289
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:44,290
from time to time about delivering the

290
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:46,990
result so at some point you're ready

291
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:48,820
you're ready to deliver your feature

292
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:50,520
your project your application whatever

293
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:53,140
and you get to the next problem of

294
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:55,210
negative perfectionism that is called

295
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:57,460
unnecessary task or as I call it a

296
00:13:57,460 --> 00:14:00,760
cherry on top the moment you're ready to

297
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,320
deliver your feature your project your

298
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,900
application whatever an evil idea comes

299
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:06,510
to your mind

300
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:09,720
hmm this thing might be improved a bit

301
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:12,370
and you start with just taking a look

302
00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:16,120
and another evil idea comes to your mind

303
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,740
mmm this is not hard

304
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:19,540
shouldn't take more than 10-15 minutes

305
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:23,470
now and you dive deeper and deeper and

306
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:26,680
deeper and at the end you spent the

307
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:28,480
whole day for something that at best

308
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,550
doesn't bring value to the project at

309
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:32,620
worst you Ron get recept hard because

310
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:34,860
this feature works unpredictable and

311
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:37,600
predictably I'm sorry or just ruins the

312
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,150
whole project and only then you realize

313
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:42,730
how stupid this day was so we see that

314
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:44,950
negative perfectionism brings a lot of

315
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:46,780
troubles into our lives into the lives

316
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:49,210
of those we are working with and those

317
00:14:49,210 --> 00:14:51,820
who dare to live with us but what is the

318
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:56,080
solution a lot of resources advice to

319
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:59,160
just stop being a perfectionist

320
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:03,400
this is much easier to say than to do my

321
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:06,490
solution is to convert this obsession

322
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:10,180
driven negative perfectionism into the

323
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:12,880
positive perfectionism how we can

324
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:15,310
achieve this let's get straight into the

325
00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:18,130
examples let me tell your story

326
00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:20,920
by the age of 40 before establishing one

327
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,269
of the most profitable and well-known

328
00:15:22,269 --> 00:15:24,339
companies in the world Henry Ford had

329
00:15:24,339 --> 00:15:27,149
established two other car companies and

330
00:15:27,149 --> 00:15:30,940
failed with both moreover the management

331
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:34,180
of the second company had to push Ford

332
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:36,040
off the company just four months after

333
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:39,279
he established it a lot of resources

334
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:41,319
attribute these failures to Ford's

335
00:15:41,319 --> 00:15:44,079
craving for perfectionism according to

336
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:46,209
the story of this second camp car

337
00:15:46,209 --> 00:15:49,540
company that is now called Cadillac Ford

338
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:51,910
was constantly working on perfecting the

339
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:54,910
designs of the cars completely ignoring

340
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:57,339
deadlines and postponing production of

341
00:15:57,339 --> 00:15:59,889
the real car but no matter his craving

342
00:15:59,889 --> 00:16:01,750
for perfectionism the first cars of his

343
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:04,180
third company that now is known as Ford

344
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:07,329
Motor Company we're just on par with the

345
00:16:07,329 --> 00:16:09,430
competitors neither better nor worse

346
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:12,579
they were just rich cars because of this

347
00:16:12,579 --> 00:16:15,519
Ford insisted on postponing production

348
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:18,279
of the cars before they get perfected at

349
00:16:18,279 --> 00:16:19,839
this moment the investors had enough of

350
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:21,790
Ford and insisted on implementing the

351
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:25,800
paradigm make sale now fix them later

352
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:28,660
had it been not to the healthy attitude

353
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:30,279
to perfectionism from the investors of

354
00:16:30,279 --> 00:16:32,800
the Ford the world might have never

355
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,660
heard of Henry Ford he would just push

356
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:37,449
his third company off the bridge as he

357
00:16:37,449 --> 00:16:41,230
did two times before that but let's take

358
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:42,399
a look at the difference between

359
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:44,680
negative and positive perfectionism in

360
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:47,920
our industry two statements the first

361
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:51,759
one my product should be perfect I'm not

362
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:53,769
going to you release develop a feature

363
00:16:53,769 --> 00:16:58,839
commit before I'm sure it is perfect and

364
00:16:58,839 --> 00:17:01,360
the second one my product should be

365
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:05,140
perfect and this release feature commit

366
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:08,319
moves me one step closer to this perfect

367
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:09,220
result

368
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:11,439
well this example is really easy to see

369
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:12,579
that to notice the difference between

370
00:17:12,579 --> 00:17:14,169
unhealthy and healthy attitude to

371
00:17:14,169 --> 00:17:16,150
perfectionism and see how the negative

372
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:19,449
perfectionism really blocks us when we

373
00:17:19,449 --> 00:17:26,559
create things we have to accept we have

374
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:29,260
to learn ourselves to get to this

375
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:31,800
positive attitude to perfectionism

376
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:34,890
we have to accept that our products can

377
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:37,740
leave in any version alpha beta 0.1

378
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:40,020
anything they should not be perfect from

379
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:43,040
day one they might be even incomplete

380
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:45,510
Jim Bouchard author and motivational

381
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:47,900
speaker tells this about perfectionism

382
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:51,330
perfection is not a destination it's a

383
00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:55,770
never ending process enjoy because if we

384
00:17:55,770 --> 00:17:57,710
do not convert into the positive

385
00:17:57,710 --> 00:18:00,900
perfectionists we tend to grasp all the

386
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:02,520
information we have in our industry in

387
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:05,130
order to just understand what is perfect

388
00:18:05,130 --> 00:18:07,710
and what is not and then we tend to fall

389
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:11,850
into the next bug of our program that is

390
00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:16,140
called impostor phenomenon I bet some of

391
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:18,240
you are sitting and asking what

392
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:22,740
phenomenon and would be right until

393
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:25,140
recently this topic has not been really

394
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:29,730
covered in our industry but scientific

395
00:18:29,730 --> 00:18:31,560
research shows that two out of five

396
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:34,500
successful people constantly suffer from

397
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:37,290
it and up to 70% of the general

398
00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:39,390
population has experienced this problem

399
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:41,910
at least your during at least one period

400
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:46,620
of their professional career so let me

401
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:50,010
give you three statements and then I

402
00:18:50,010 --> 00:18:53,310
will ask you to raise your hands let's

403
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:55,470
start with the first statement you think

404
00:18:55,470 --> 00:18:58,830
that your success in something is due to

405
00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:00,930
luck timing or any other third party

406
00:19:00,930 --> 00:19:05,370
power not your hard-working your

407
00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:08,580
intelligence or your talent the first

408
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:11,550
one the second one you think that others

409
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:13,380
might discover that you're not as

410
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:16,970
skilled as they think you are

411
00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:19,650
wait a second wait a second wait for it

412
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:22,830
the third one you think that others are

413
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:26,730
more intelligent than you are and now

414
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:29,730
it's your time who can say that please

415
00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:33,800
something on this list applies to them

416
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:36,870
wonderful take a look keep keep the

417
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:39,300
hands just like those and front

418
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:40,800
take a look like almost the whole

419
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:44,750
audience

420
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:47,450
welcome welcome to the club of Impostors

421
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:50,100
and let me congratulate you because we

422
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:51,990
are all in a really good company you

423
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:54,360
think why would anyone want to see me

424
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:56,280
again in the movie and I don't know how

425
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:58,799
to act anyway so why am I doing this

426
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:04,320
Meryl Streep actress 389 nominations 156

427
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:07,220
wins three Oscars as Best Actress I

428
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:09,090
always feel like something of an

429
00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:10,770
imposter I don't know what I'm doing I'm

430
00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:12,660
not a writer I've been fooling myself

431
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:15,900
and other people John Steinbeck and

432
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:18,540
writer 27 books Pulitzer Prize for

433
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:20,690
fiction Nobel Prize in Literature I

434
00:20:20,690 --> 00:20:23,520
still doubt myself every single day what

435
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,590
people believe is my self-confidence is

436
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:27,540
actually my reaction to fear

437
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:30,929
Will Smith actor musician six American

438
00:20:30,929 --> 00:20:32,549
Music Awards four Grammys two Oscar

439
00:20:32,549 --> 00:20:37,070
nominations as Best Actor so technically

440
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:40,140
impostor phenomenon is the inability to

441
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:44,520
internalize your own achievements that

442
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:45,840
leads you to the feeling that you were

443
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,669
less competent than the rest of the

444
00:20:47,669 --> 00:20:54,179
world believes you to be the term

445
00:20:54,179 --> 00:20:57,000
imposter phenomenon when I first heard

446
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,040
about it I had my WoW moment because I

447
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:01,049
didn't even know that the feelings I had

448
00:21:01,049 --> 00:21:03,960
had a name but it they had and quite

449
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:07,679
established name the term impostor

450
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:10,169
phenomenon first appeared in the

451
00:21:10,169 --> 00:21:14,280
scientific from 1978 dedicated to high

452
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:19,049
achieving women in academics that's true

453
00:21:19,049 --> 00:21:20,700
for many years scientific community

454
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:23,340
believed that this phenomenon is highly

455
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:25,950
confined to high achieving women but the

456
00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:28,140
very same same scientists now believe

457
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:31,260
that this feeling the feeling of being

458
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:33,419
proud is much more universal and it

459
00:21:33,419 --> 00:21:35,640
might be even more problematic for man

460
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:38,280
because naturally it's much harder for

461
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:41,370
man to confess like insecurity and

462
00:21:41,370 --> 00:21:44,490
incompetence hence men end up hiding

463
00:21:44,490 --> 00:21:46,950
their fears being unable to unburden

464
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:52,890
them and seek help

465
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:56,470
when we do not pay attention to our

466
00:21:56,470 --> 00:21:58,980
imposter syndrome what can happen from

467
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:01,510
simple psychological discomfort that the

468
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:03,520
insecurity brings it can lead us

469
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:07,120
straight to failure only a couple of

470
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,220
years ago I had several applications of

471
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:10,840
to read functionality in my portable

472
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:14,890
devices like pocket flip board

473
00:22:14,890 --> 00:22:17,740
Instapaper and I was sending saving all

474
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:20,440
the news all the interesting things you

475
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:22,690
know in our community right then there

476
00:22:22,690 --> 00:22:25,630
were magazines Smashing Magazine at

477
00:22:25,630 --> 00:22:27,790
least the part net magazine those

478
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:30,400
constantly brought me the latest how-tos

479
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,470
and tutorials and news from like

480
00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:34,510
interesting articles from the world of

481
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:36,580
development from the from the web

482
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:40,179
development then we have Twitter reading

483
00:22:40,179 --> 00:22:41,950
Twitter might be depressed on its own

484
00:22:41,950 --> 00:22:43,990
because in so many talented people

485
00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:45,400
bragging about their achievements and

486
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:47,559
their success doesn't help fighting

487
00:22:47,559 --> 00:22:50,050
impostor syndrome at all but my story

488
00:22:50,050 --> 00:22:52,480
doesn't end up then here of course there

489
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:56,200
were also RSS feeds newsletters like

490
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,330
HTML weekly JavaScript weekly there were

491
00:22:58,330 --> 00:23:00,550
videos from the most recent conferences

492
00:23:00,550 --> 00:23:02,679
and these constantly brought me new

493
00:23:02,679 --> 00:23:04,570
information and I tried to consume all

494
00:23:04,570 --> 00:23:07,809
of this information but in the flow of

495
00:23:07,809 --> 00:23:10,360
all of this information I also have to

496
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:12,640
find time to do real work that paid my

497
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,580
bills so naturally enough one day I

498
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:17,470
figured out that I don't read those

499
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:20,110
articles anymore on the past days I

500
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:22,030
would just glance through the titles

501
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:24,490
pick two or three and they would stay

502
00:23:24,490 --> 00:23:27,010
opened in my browsers in my browser

503
00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:31,510
usually untouched for days so why did it

504
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:34,510
end up like this why didn't I feel

505
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:36,190
myself more competent after consuming

506
00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:38,470
all of this information the answer is

507
00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:40,420
that it wasn't me

508
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:41,559
who was interested in all this

509
00:23:41,559 --> 00:23:43,690
information it was my imposter syndrome

510
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:46,690
pushing me to learn all these things so

511
00:23:46,690 --> 00:23:48,610
that I wouldn't feel myself an

512
00:23:48,610 --> 00:23:51,550
incompetent fraud so what impostor

513
00:23:51,550 --> 00:23:53,350
syndrome really does is instead of

514
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:55,660
pushing us to learn new exciting things

515
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:58,150
that we can apply in our work it leads

516
00:23:58,150 --> 00:24:02,560
us to the state of frustration but those

517
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,929
who have ever experienced this feeling I

518
00:24:04,929 --> 00:24:06,179
have good

519
00:24:06,179 --> 00:24:09,659
you see for you the irony of imposter

520
00:24:09,659 --> 00:24:13,080
syndrome is that true frauds seem to

521
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:16,409
rarely experience this feeling as simple

522
00:24:16,409 --> 00:24:19,710
as that or as English philosopher

523
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:21,539
Bertrand Russell puts it in a more

524
00:24:21,539 --> 00:24:23,519
poetic way the trouble with the world is

525
00:24:23,519 --> 00:24:25,559
that the stupid our culture and the

526
00:24:25,559 --> 00:24:30,779
intelligent are full of doubt so one

527
00:24:30,779 --> 00:24:32,490
interesting thing of imposter syndrome

528
00:24:32,490 --> 00:24:35,249
is that we cannot really fight it we

529
00:24:35,249 --> 00:24:37,259
cannot change the situation because

530
00:24:37,259 --> 00:24:38,820
nobody can guarantee you that you are

531
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:40,320
competent enough to be in this industry

532
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,899
nobody can guarantee that you are the

533
00:24:42,899 --> 00:24:45,899
smartest in the room it's impossible so

534
00:24:45,899 --> 00:24:48,119
instead of fighting these things that

535
00:24:48,119 --> 00:24:50,129
drive us into impostor syndrome what we

536
00:24:50,129 --> 00:24:53,039
have to do is change our attitude to

537
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:55,679
this feeling and the first thing we have

538
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:59,899
to start with is embrace impulse train

539
00:24:59,899 --> 00:25:03,389
Pacific Standard magazine puts this says

540
00:25:03,389 --> 00:25:05,610
this imposter ism is for many people and

541
00:25:05,610 --> 00:25:08,129
natural symptom of gaining expertise and

542
00:25:08,129 --> 00:25:12,749
this makes total sense when we gain

543
00:25:12,749 --> 00:25:14,399
expertise we extend the perimeter of

544
00:25:14,399 --> 00:25:16,619
what we know but at the same time we

545
00:25:16,619 --> 00:25:19,590
expose ourselves to even more of what we

546
00:25:19,590 --> 00:25:22,909
don't so next time you have an attack of

547
00:25:22,909 --> 00:25:26,399
imposter syndrome do not rush to get the

548
00:25:26,399 --> 00:25:31,499
new information instead just stop stop

549
00:25:31,499 --> 00:25:33,480
and enjoy this moment because most

550
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:36,539
probably this is the sign of you gaining

551
00:25:36,539 --> 00:25:40,529
expertise you gaining wisdom to realize

552
00:25:40,529 --> 00:25:43,470
that there is much more in this world to

553
00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:47,279
discover and there is much more in our

554
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:50,879
industry for us to discover yet but I

555
00:25:50,879 --> 00:25:53,159
deliberately say most probably because

556
00:25:53,159 --> 00:25:56,100
some people confuse stupid bravery to

557
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:58,049
expertise and this is completely

558
00:25:58,049 --> 00:26:00,600
different story another thing I would

559
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,909
tell I could tell you to change our

560
00:26:02,909 --> 00:26:05,730
attitude to impostor syndrome is measure

561
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:08,999
yourself with your own yardstick it's

562
00:26:08,999 --> 00:26:11,730
very easy now industry to be consumed by

563
00:26:11,730 --> 00:26:15,359
comparing yourself to others but this is

564
00:26:15,359 --> 00:26:18,299
the game impossible to win instead try

565
00:26:18,299 --> 00:26:20,070
comparing yourself

566
00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:23,100
to yourself compete to yourself where

567
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:26,010
were you a year ago six months ago can

568
00:26:26,010 --> 00:26:27,630
you see the difference can you see this

569
00:26:27,630 --> 00:26:31,260
progress if you can there was a

570
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:33,480
wonderful talk at the recent smashing

571
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:35,880
conference in Barcelona and the Yuko

572
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:38,250
wonderful illustrator it said if you

573
00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:40,530
look at your pop works and they look

574
00:26:40,530 --> 00:26:42,800
 probably you're on the right track

575
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:45,540
probably you're on the right track
this is exactly this feeling like if you

576
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:47,970
see that now you're much better than you

577
00:26:47,970 --> 00:26:50,670
did a year ago you're on the right track

578
00:26:50,670 --> 00:26:55,050
and last but definitely not least I can

579
00:26:55,050 --> 00:26:58,200
tell you communicate your fears this

580
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:01,040
might sound a bit scary but Neil Gaiman

581
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:03,870
an acknowledged author of comic books

582
00:27:03,870 --> 00:27:07,080
and movies and different books it has a

583
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:09,180
perfect anecdote to soothe anyone with

584
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:11,750
impostor syndrome let me read it for you

585
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:14,310
some years ago I was lucky enough to be

586
00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:15,780
invited to a gathering of great and good

587
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:18,390
people artists and scientists writers

588
00:27:18,390 --> 00:27:20,730
and discoverers of things and I felt

589
00:27:20,730 --> 00:27:22,500
that at any moment they would realize

590
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:25,320
that I didn't qualify to be there among

591
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:29,220
these people who had really done things

592
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:31,920
on my second or third night there I was

593
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,870
standing at the back of the hall while a

594
00:27:33,870 --> 00:27:41,280
musical entertainment happened and I

595
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:43,170
started talking to a very nice polite

596
00:27:43,170 --> 00:27:46,580
elderly gentleman about several things

597
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:49,560
putting our shared first name and that

598
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:50,970
he pointed to the call of people and

599
00:27:50,970 --> 00:27:53,250
said words to the effect often I just

600
00:27:53,250 --> 00:27:56,130
look at all these people

601
00:27:56,130 --> 00:27:59,570
what the heck am I doing here

602
00:27:59,570 --> 00:28:10,369
they have make amazing things I think

603
00:28:10,369 --> 00:28:12,799
that counts you something and I felt a

604
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:15,049
bit better because Neil Armstrong felt

605
00:28:15,049 --> 00:28:20,330
like an impostor maybe everyone so do

606
00:28:20,330 --> 00:28:21,919
not be afraid of communicating your

607
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:24,979
fears next time when you're in the

608
00:28:24,979 --> 00:28:28,639
office and afraid of being found out by

609
00:28:28,639 --> 00:28:30,259
your colleague that you do not know as

610
00:28:30,259 --> 00:28:33,229
much as they think you do tap into the

611
00:28:33,229 --> 00:28:35,210
knowledge that probably the people

612
00:28:35,210 --> 00:28:38,210
around you might feel inadequate as well

613
00:28:38,210 --> 00:28:40,070
they might have exactly the same

614
00:28:40,070 --> 00:28:44,389
feelings even even your boss because if

615
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:47,119
we do not change our attitude to

616
00:28:47,119 --> 00:28:49,759
impostor syndrome it pushes us to work

617
00:28:49,759 --> 00:28:52,129
really hard in order to prove ourselves

618
00:28:52,129 --> 00:28:54,799
and then we tend to get into the third

619
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:58,460
bug of our program that is called as

620
00:28:58,460 --> 00:29:02,359
simple as long hours let's start with

621
00:29:02,359 --> 00:29:05,869
raise of hands I will ask you three

622
00:29:05,869 --> 00:29:08,929
questions the first one have you ever

623
00:29:08,929 --> 00:29:13,369
worked long hours like developing

624
00:29:13,369 --> 00:29:15,649
something or writing CSS or JavaScript

625
00:29:15,649 --> 00:29:19,220
or like you work the whole day and then

626
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:21,379
you extend this day and then keep going

627
00:29:21,379 --> 00:29:24,289
after midnight or something how many of

628
00:29:24,289 --> 00:29:27,580
you had to have done this at least once

629
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:29,899
wonderful what a stupid question I ask

630
00:29:29,899 --> 00:29:33,259
huh okay how many of you do this on a

631
00:29:33,259 --> 00:29:40,269
regular basis okay now the main question

632
00:29:40,269 --> 00:29:44,210
how many of you the day after putting

633
00:29:44,210 --> 00:29:46,700
these long hours like writing CSS after

634
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:48,470
midnight or JavaScript after midnight

635
00:29:48,470 --> 00:29:51,499
realize that the things that were

636
00:29:51,499 --> 00:29:53,809
written that late have to be tossed away

637
00:29:53,809 --> 00:29:56,419
they are either buggy or not functioning

638
00:29:56,419 --> 00:29:59,119
well or they completely break project

639
00:29:59,119 --> 00:30:08,049
please raise it okay good so long hours

640
00:30:08,049 --> 00:30:12,049
are nothing you know industry but I

641
00:30:12,049 --> 00:30:13,190
haven't made that I have never

642
00:30:13,190 --> 00:30:15,350
heard of cases of people on the death

643
00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:17,270
path saying something like oh god why

644
00:30:17,270 --> 00:30:20,510
was I working so ladle conversely

645
00:30:20,510 --> 00:30:22,550
palliative nurses working with anta life

646
00:30:22,550 --> 00:30:24,500
care state that one of the most

647
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:27,830
mentioned regrets people say on their

648
00:30:27,830 --> 00:30:29,870
death bass is that they were working way

649
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:34,400
too much and again long hours in our

650
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:38,120
industry is nothing new from touch time

651
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:40,880
we just have to put long hours because

652
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:43,760
we have to finish some something or do

653
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:46,310
some some really really urgent work

654
00:30:46,310 --> 00:30:50,620
right so long hours per se are not a bug

655
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:53,270
there are two different types of long

656
00:30:53,270 --> 00:30:56,900
hours though temporary long hours this

657
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:58,280
is the type of long hours that we

658
00:30:58,280 --> 00:30:59,960
usually put one for example in you

659
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:02,480
exciting technology is out and we are

660
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:04,940
willing to figure out how this works so

661
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:06,740
we are willing to put these long hours

662
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:08,990
in order to be smarter to be to

663
00:31:08,990 --> 00:31:10,490
understand how this new thing works

664
00:31:10,490 --> 00:31:12,980
another case of course is around

665
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:14,510
deadlines because we all know how good

666
00:31:14,510 --> 00:31:16,780
we are with time estimations aren't we

667
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:20,510
so this type of long hours is typical

668
00:31:20,510 --> 00:31:22,130
for somebody who we would call hard

669
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:24,800
working developer but there is another

670
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,930
type of long hours that is more

671
00:31:26,930 --> 00:31:31,340
permanent and perfectionism and

672
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:33,770
impulsive syndrome as problems set us

673
00:31:33,770 --> 00:31:35,450
straight into this category of long

674
00:31:35,450 --> 00:31:38,450
hours this type of long hours is typical

675
00:31:38,450 --> 00:31:39,710
for somebody who we would call a

676
00:31:39,710 --> 00:31:40,700
workaholic

677
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:42,830
it's kind of hard to see the difference

678
00:31:42,830 --> 00:31:44,240
between hard working people

679
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:47,420
and workaholics but I like how Brian

680
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:51,140
Robinson psychotherapist puts this hard

681
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:52,820
working people usually have some balance

682
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:54,800
in their life they might see that they

683
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:58,490
tasks and think about skiing while

684
00:31:58,490 --> 00:32:00,590
workaholics are on the ski slopes

685
00:32:00,590 --> 00:32:12,680
thinking about work this this problem in

686
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:17,150
our industry is dictated by our

687
00:32:17,150 --> 00:32:19,370
privilege we are privileged in our

688
00:32:19,370 --> 00:32:21,530
industry because we can work from

689
00:32:21,530 --> 00:32:24,860
anywhere in the world anytime and for

690
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:27,220
some developers and more so for some

691
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:31,280
employers this means all the time but

692
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:34,190
the question is do we manage to do more

693
00:32:34,190 --> 00:32:36,170
during these long hours maybe we are

694
00:32:36,170 --> 00:32:38,960
more productive in the beginning of

695
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:41,510
1920s an American company conducted the

696
00:32:41,510 --> 00:32:44,299
research including their own employees

697
00:32:44,299 --> 00:32:48,380
and figured out that 20 hours in

698
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:51,500
addition to the average 40 hours week so

699
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:54,920
60 hours week in total indeed leads to

700
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:58,160
increased productivity 60 hours a week

701
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:00,350
increased productivity but it takes only

702
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:03,710
3 to 4 weeks for the productivity

703
00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:09,740
actually to turn negative so this

704
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:13,010
research has been conducted by the Ford

705
00:33:13,010 --> 00:33:15,020
Motor Company one of the earliest

706
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:19,370
adopters of 40 hours week so as we can

707
00:33:19,370 --> 00:33:21,890
see the fact that we are busy during

708
00:33:21,890 --> 00:33:24,320
these long hours doesn't really mean

709
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:26,360
that we are productive during these long

710
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:30,669
hours why let me introduce you to our

711
00:33:30,669 --> 00:33:32,860
front brain

712
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:35,840
no matter the unexplored potential of a

713
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:39,650
human brain in the simplest form it

714
00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:42,020
still behaves like a simple muscle and

715
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:44,720
when we put long hours as a regular

716
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:47,270
muscle our brain gets tired when our

717
00:33:47,270 --> 00:33:49,730
brain gets tired it's prone to making

718
00:33:49,730 --> 00:33:54,530
errors in the world where we crave for

719
00:33:54,530 --> 00:33:56,030
perfectionism where we want to deliver

720
00:33:56,030 --> 00:33:58,070
the best possible results this leads us

721
00:33:58,070 --> 00:34:00,950
to mental record it all starts with long

722
00:34:00,950 --> 00:34:03,950
hours as an attempt to achieve more to

723
00:34:03,950 --> 00:34:06,169
be more productive our brain gets tired

724
00:34:06,169 --> 00:34:09,770
and we make errors in our work when we

725
00:34:09,770 --> 00:34:11,899
make errors we cannot be satisfied with

726
00:34:11,899 --> 00:34:13,550
the results so we lack the feeling of

727
00:34:13,550 --> 00:34:15,679
accomplishment and in order to regain

728
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:17,919
this feeling of accomplishment and we

729
00:34:17,919 --> 00:34:21,770
fix all these problems again we put long

730
00:34:21,770 --> 00:34:26,720
hours this mental recursion and long

731
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:28,879
hours instead of making us more

732
00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:30,530
productive actually leads us to the

733
00:34:30,530 --> 00:34:33,409
state of stress but stress and it's

734
00:34:33,409 --> 00:34:36,200
heavier forms like burnout are not only

735
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:40,339
about productivity

736
00:34:40,349 --> 00:34:46,149
Hiroshi in Japanese in technically means

737
00:34:46,149 --> 00:34:49,569
death by overwork according to different

738
00:34:49,569 --> 00:34:51,460
resources in 2015

739
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:55,599
10,000 people died in Japan solely due

740
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:58,630
to overwork 10,000 people but even then

741
00:34:58,630 --> 00:35:00,849
these terms tells nowhere near another

742
00:35:00,849 --> 00:35:05,200
term ghoul Allah see that technically

743
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:07,390
means the same death by overwork but in

744
00:35:07,390 --> 00:35:13,619
Chinese every year China loses about

745
00:35:13,619 --> 00:35:16,960
600,000 people due to overwork this

746
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:20,470
results to 16 deaths every day due to

747
00:35:20,470 --> 00:35:22,420
overwork we're not talking about people

748
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:24,539
working with sharp objects or guns

749
00:35:24,539 --> 00:35:26,950
majority of these people are white

750
00:35:26,950 --> 00:35:30,160
colours sitting in the offices in order

751
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:32,349
to understand why stress is so dangerous

752
00:35:32,349 --> 00:35:35,259
to us we have to dive a bit deeper into

753
00:35:35,259 --> 00:35:39,609
our friend brain so when when we feel

754
00:35:39,609 --> 00:35:41,859
stressed our brain sends signals all

755
00:35:41,859 --> 00:35:44,079
over our body to enable the protective

756
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:46,539
mechanism among other things this

757
00:35:46,539 --> 00:35:49,019
mechanism consists of two chemicals

758
00:35:49,019 --> 00:35:51,460
adrenaline and the so called stress

759
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:56,160
hormone cortisol combination of this is

760
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:59,259
brilliant it helps us make really fast

761
00:35:59,259 --> 00:36:00,869
decisions when we are in real danger

762
00:36:00,869 --> 00:36:03,940
this combination is very similar to

763
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:07,240
adding important to your CSS files it

764
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:11,079
overrides everything else our body

765
00:36:11,079 --> 00:36:14,769
forgets about how to plan our life for

766
00:36:14,769 --> 00:36:17,200
the next 10 years because it's busy with

767
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:19,119
thinking how to survive the next 10

768
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:23,779
minutes this is what stress does to us

769
00:36:23,789 --> 00:36:27,279
this mechanism is vital for hours for

770
00:36:27,279 --> 00:36:30,339
for us to survive right and it might

771
00:36:30,339 --> 00:36:33,099
even bring this creative adrenaline kick

772
00:36:33,099 --> 00:36:34,509
to those hard-working developers to

773
00:36:34,509 --> 00:36:36,119
finish that one feature before deadline

774
00:36:36,119 --> 00:36:39,369
but the same mechanism applied for

775
00:36:39,369 --> 00:36:41,710
prolonged periods of time to our brain

776
00:36:41,710 --> 00:36:47,170
can severely damage our brain recent

777
00:36:47,170 --> 00:36:49,839
research in Berkeley California and

778
00:36:49,839 --> 00:36:52,440
Sweden show that

779
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:55,020
our brain physically changes its

780
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:56,910
structure under prolonged periods of

781
00:36:56,910 --> 00:36:58,860
stress this is what happens and McDonald

782
00:36:58,860 --> 00:37:00,420
region is increased thinning of the

783
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:02,190
prefrontal cortex shrinking of the

784
00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:03,870
hippocampus and the only question we

785
00:37:03,870 --> 00:37:05,400
might have here is what the heck does

786
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:08,070
this mean so let me translate this into

787
00:37:08,070 --> 00:37:10,140
human readable language it means

788
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:12,380
premature aging of your brain

789
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:15,090
significant drop in learning abilities

790
00:37:15,090 --> 00:37:18,270
and weakened memory and make it

791
00:37:18,270 --> 00:37:21,570
ridiculously obvious these three income

792
00:37:21,570 --> 00:37:24,900
in combination are the signs of mental

793
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:30,000
disability isn't it amazing we do work

794
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,100
hard we want to achieve the best

795
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:34,620
possible result we learn new things and

796
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:37,680
the paycheck for all of this is early

797
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:43,020
dementia or Alzheimer's we have to do

798
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:45,000
something about this I'm pretty sure

799
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,650
that you are familiar with the most

800
00:37:46,650 --> 00:37:50,030
common ways to fight stress like

801
00:37:50,030 --> 00:37:53,670
physical exercises or meditation simple

802
00:37:53,670 --> 00:37:55,770
as simple things as chocolate or

803
00:37:55,770 --> 00:37:58,200
ultraviolet light can help you find

804
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:02,010
stress a bit but today I want to talk to

805
00:38:02,010 --> 00:38:04,500
you about another approach approach that

806
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:09,060
would help you to prevent this severe

807
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:11,250
damage to our brains let's talk about

808
00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:13,710
Harvard Howard University we all know

809
00:38:13,710 --> 00:38:17,010
about Harvard right it's 133 Nobel

810
00:38:17,010 --> 00:38:19,530
laureates 35 current billionaires 8

811
00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:21,120
presidents of the United States it's the

812
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:23,550
birthplace for Facebook and Microsoft

813
00:38:23,550 --> 00:38:26,250
it's also active universities in the

814
00:38:26,250 --> 00:38:30,060
world in 2017 only 5.8%

815
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:33,390
applicants a gained admission to this

816
00:38:33,390 --> 00:38:35,460
university because in the process of

817
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:38,190
admission things not directly related to

818
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:40,860
studying are taken into account as well

819
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:43,440
like achievements and music achievements

820
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:46,620
and supports owned startup business and

821
00:38:46,620 --> 00:38:48,270
so on and so on so it wouldn't be an

822
00:38:48,270 --> 00:38:50,040
exaggeration to say that anybody

823
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:51,750
studying at Harvard has to leave

824
00:38:51,750 --> 00:38:53,880
completely crazy life dedicating every

825
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:55,560
minute of his or her life

826
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:58,470
to either studying or self-development

827
00:38:58,470 --> 00:39:02,820
and a lot of them do in 2004 there were

828
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:05,940
it was a meeting between students

829
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:07,349
the management of the University where

830
00:39:07,349 --> 00:39:10,619
students raised some concerns quite

831
00:39:10,619 --> 00:39:13,349
weird concerns I must say so some

832
00:39:13,349 --> 00:39:16,530
students claimed that they want to take

833
00:39:16,530 --> 00:39:19,290
two full-size courses four-year courses

834
00:39:19,290 --> 00:39:23,460
and pass them in parallel others wanted

835
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:25,500
to take the full four years course and

836
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:27,480
pass it within three years so

837
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:30,210
technically what students wanted was to

838
00:39:30,210 --> 00:39:33,030
do as much as they possibly could while

839
00:39:33,030 --> 00:39:36,000
they are at Harvard what a pleasant

840
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,099
thing should it be for management of

841
00:39:38,099 --> 00:39:39,660
university to hear these things from the

842
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:41,790
students right but instead of being

843
00:39:41,790 --> 00:39:46,800
impressed Harry Lewis Dean of Harvard

844
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:49,500
undergraduate school back then sent a

845
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:54,050
letter to all the students in Harvard

846
00:39:54,050 --> 00:39:57,750
titled slow down getting more out of

847
00:39:57,750 --> 00:40:01,349
Harvard by doing less in this letter

848
00:40:01,349 --> 00:40:03,599
Harry Lewis appealed to the students

849
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:06,480
that instead of increased mental

850
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:09,180
pressure what they really need is to

851
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:14,220
slow down he advocated to for students

852
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:16,560
to take some time off Harvard and not

853
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:18,450
just an evening or a week but take the

854
00:40:18,450 --> 00:40:22,069
whole term or the whole year of Harvard

855
00:40:22,069 --> 00:40:24,089
naturally enough the parents of the

856
00:40:24,089 --> 00:40:25,980
students were furious reasonably

857
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:29,250
believing that after spending one year

858
00:40:29,250 --> 00:40:32,609
of Harvard students won't be remembering

859
00:40:32,609 --> 00:40:34,380
anything they had they learned before

860
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:37,140
leaving Harvard or they just won't be

861
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:40,050
willing to get back to Harvard right but

862
00:40:40,050 --> 00:40:44,310
statistics tells us 96% of those who had

863
00:40:44,310 --> 00:40:49,050
full year of Harvard came back gained

864
00:40:49,050 --> 00:40:52,020
grad mission and successfully graduated

865
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:54,990
Harvard Harvard calls it this slow

866
00:40:54,990 --> 00:40:59,390
learning drew faust current president of

867
00:40:59,390 --> 00:41:02,430
Harvard University says college can help

868
00:41:02,430 --> 00:41:06,900
you learn how to think more than what to

869
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:10,710
think how to think more than what to

870
00:41:10,710 --> 00:41:14,339
think and I believe this is exactly the

871
00:41:14,339 --> 00:41:17,310
problem that we have in our industry we

872
00:41:17,310 --> 00:41:19,740
have tons of information telling us

873
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:22,890
to think even if it's titled how to but

874
00:41:22,890 --> 00:41:28,190
we have to learn ourselves how to think

875
00:41:28,190 --> 00:41:31,410
today we have seen that a program

876
00:41:31,410 --> 00:41:35,010
presenting an average developer has a

877
00:41:35,010 --> 00:41:36,990
lot of box we have covered just the tip

878
00:41:36,990 --> 00:41:38,960
of the iceberg there are many more

879
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:42,660
problems in this program but unlike our

880
00:41:42,660 --> 00:41:45,030
projects we cannot postpone fixing this

881
00:41:45,030 --> 00:41:47,250
box for later because unlike our

882
00:41:47,250 --> 00:41:51,060
projects this program has no versions

883
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:55,110
other than 1.0 and debugging and fixing

884
00:41:55,110 --> 00:41:58,230
problems we have to do we have to do it

885
00:41:58,230 --> 00:42:02,670
straight in production does our industry

886
00:42:02,670 --> 00:42:04,200
need more professional successful

887
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:08,850
developers frankly I don't know but what

888
00:42:08,850 --> 00:42:10,920
is certain is that our industry is more

889
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:18,119
healthy more happy developers my name is

890
00:42:18,119 --> 00:42:21,750
Dennis I am a developer and I have a lot

891
00:42:21,750 --> 00:42:24,240
of problems because of this but as

892
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:26,670
psychiatrists say acknowledging a

893
00:42:26,670 --> 00:42:29,190
problem is the first step to mental

894
00:42:29,190 --> 00:42:30,460
health

895
00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:34,329
today I have shared some problems and I

896
00:42:34,329 --> 00:42:37,420
personally have but I'm sure they have

897
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:40,030
resonated with some of you because even

898
00:42:40,030 --> 00:42:42,640
though our friend the doesn't mean we

899
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:46,510
cannot have the same problems Department

900
00:42:46,510 --> 00:42:50,980
these problems to your production stay

901
00:42:50,980 --> 00:42:56,740
healthy stay happy thank you
