1
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:14,040

okay so I've just been introduced

2
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:16,080
apparently now knew who I am so I can

3
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:17,880
skip over that part the talk and as you

4
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:21,120
can see it's about color CSS for color

5
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:23,610
css3 color is what you already use its

6
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:25,800
boring stuff well I was co-editor of

7
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,360
that too but you will know about that so

8
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,490
that's boring so that's me we already

9
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:32,489
established that and that and that and

10
00:00:32,489 --> 00:00:36,929
that only that but the the CSS for color

11
00:00:36,929 --> 00:00:38,850
part that's the interesting thing that's

12
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:40,170
what I'm here to talk to you about today

13
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:42,179
actually i lied i'm not going to talk

14
00:00:42,179 --> 00:00:44,999
about CSS for color except for like one

15
00:00:44,999 --> 00:00:46,379
minute at the beginning and two minutes

16
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:49,159
at the end because here's the problem

17
00:00:49,159 --> 00:00:52,620
okay this is what we have in CSS for

18
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:55,920
color as you can see we have kurma here

19
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,589
a hue angle here we've got a full back

20
00:00:58,589 --> 00:01:00,719
color and an alpha right understood i

21
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:03,510
can just stop now right yeah the thing

22
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:05,220
is you can look at that you can see what

23
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:07,680
the syntax is what you don't know is

24
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,010
what does it mean Chris why would I ever

25
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:13,590
want to do this so what this talk is

26
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:16,680
actually going to be about firstly some

27
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:19,620
basics of our color then we're going to

28
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:22,380
talk about how you measure color then

29
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:24,240
they're going to talk about CIA la b

30
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,100
which is the cool thing that i'm telling

31
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:27,720
you about that you'll understand why you

32
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:30,000
want it once you've seen it then i'm

33
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,610
going to talk about displays and print

34
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:35,340
does anyone here well ok everyone who

35
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:37,770
uses CSS you will use CSS for websites

36
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:39,960
does anyone here use CSS for printed

37
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:43,560
material as well a couple yes ok good

38
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,510
well I'll talk about that briefly and

39
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:47,880
then lastly as I said we'll get onto the

40
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:50,220
CSS for color where I show the relevance

41
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:52,620
all of this stuff so the first thing

42
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:57,050
what is that what is this device here a

43
00:01:57,050 --> 00:02:02,490
prison right what does a prison do we do

44
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:04,380
flex light and what's the results of

45
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:08,340
that it makes a rainbow right it makes a

46
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:10,019
rainbow ok so we've already established

47
00:02:10,019 --> 00:02:11,710
that you already know all about

48
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:12,880
light you know that it's made of

49
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,980
different wavelengths and that they go

50
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:16,480
through glass at different speeds and

51
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,130
therefore you can turn white light into

52
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:20,800
a rainbow and the white light actually

53
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,690
consisted of all those colors originally

54
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:24,370
so this is good we already know

55
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:26,080
something light is the range of

56
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,520
wavelengths visible to humans I

57
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,750
mentioned humans because like if you're

58
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:33,790
a bumblebee you can see some ultraviolet

59
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:35,470
and if you're a snake you can see some

60
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:37,330
infrared and so on so there's nothing

61
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:39,790
specific about those colors those colors

62
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:42,670
don't exist in nature those colors exist

63
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:45,820
in our brain in our eyes it's a human

64
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:50,500
colors as a human response or at least

65
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:51,790
the colors that we care about we don't

66
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:53,530
actually know much about bumble bees and

67
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:55,570
snakes and how they feel about color so

68
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:58,780
here is a rainbow don't worry about the

69
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:01,120
numbers but it's roughly 380 nanometers

70
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,880
to 700 nanometers that's the range of

71
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,530
wavelengths that we can see and as you

72
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:07,600
can see we got all the other colors in

73
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:10,800
between so that's the visible spectrum

74
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,210
the next thing we need to know is you

75
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:14,860
you have to don't worry about all the

76
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:16,810
labeling here there's only one thing you

77
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:18,970
need to know about which is the retina

78
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:21,010
which is this set of nerve cells at the

79
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:22,990
back the rest of it you can just assume

80
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:24,340
it works and for the purpose of this

81
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:27,880
talk that's it so what's the retina made

82
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:31,860
of well it's made out of these cells

83
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:34,780
these cells and these cells and these

84
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:36,940
cells and then a big black layer at the

85
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:38,920
back which basically stops that like

86
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,750
okay the light comes in from here this

87
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:42,370
way due to do goes through all this

88
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:44,410
wiring who designed this stuff goes

89
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:46,240
through all this wiring and then hits a

90
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,340
black layer there which it gets absorbed

91
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:52,360
and we've got rods which look roughly

92
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,460
rod-like and cones which someone in a

93
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:56,380
fit of imagination looking through a

94
00:03:56,380 --> 00:04:00,220
microscope decided with conical ish and

95
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:01,450
then you can see that they have

96
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:03,820
basically connections to these pink

97
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:05,830
cells this one is connected just three

98
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:07,810
of them and this one's connected to one

99
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:10,780
and etc and there's also these blue ones

100
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:13,900
which connect groups up laterally so

101
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:15,280
there's basically think of this as a

102
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,320
circuit there's lots of things happening

103
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:20,350
here even before we go on these these

104
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:22,130
these from the optic nerve these

105
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:23,390
out the back of your eye and go after

106
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:26,240
your brain so even before the signals

107
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,430
have left the I lots of stuff has

108
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:30,410
happened to them it's actually really

109
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:33,560
complicated there's groups Sarah was

110
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,030
talking about animation said that our

111
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:36,710
human visual system is particularly good

112
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:39,350
at detecting motion it is the parts on

113
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:41,960
the outsides of our I a really good at

114
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,820
detecting motion really poor at

115
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:46,580
detecting color the bit in the middle is

116
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:48,980
actually it tends to average things over

117
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:51,200
time so you don't notice changes fast

118
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,330
but you really precise on little color

119
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:55,700
shifts so we have two completely

120
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:58,220
different visual systems which we use in

121
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:00,350
tandem to build a mental model in our

122
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:04,400
head of what the world is okay great

123
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,250
that's fun so let's have a look there

124
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:09,020
are three different types of cones and

125
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:11,990
if you read a bag textbook they'll tell

126
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:13,460
you they're called red green and blue

127
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:17,660
cones no they are not here is the three

128
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:19,850
cones and you can see that this one has

129
00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:23,210
its maximum response in yellow this one

130
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:25,580
in yellow green and this one in bluish

131
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:28,730
violet so we'll call them LMK and s or

132
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:31,460
long medium and short wavelengths you

133
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:32,810
can also see that these two are pretty

134
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:35,510
much the same and this one hardly does

135
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:38,420
anything at all so let's look at that on

136
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:41,540
a logarithmic scale now we can see much

137
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:43,100
more yeah these two are definitely

138
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:47,510
almost the same and now if you were

139
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:49,930
building a system if you're building a

140
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:52,310
piece of electronics to measure light

141
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:54,200
you would never design it like this

142
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,580
right these two you could probably

143
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:57,260
replace that with just one sensor course

144
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:58,550
they're almost the same you would have

145
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:01,670
you would have nice sauce bandpass

146
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:03,740
functions like this to keep nice no our

147
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:07,220
eyes on like that at all this one in

148
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:08,750
fact all of these three cells have

149
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:10,160
evolved from the same cell they've just

150
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,060
diverged and got different sensitivities

151
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:15,500
so we now know that we have these and

152
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,120
these do not give us a red green in the

153
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,220
blue they're giving us these sorts of

154
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:24,470
strange values then all of that

155
00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:27,290
information goes off to the brain to

156
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:28,580
this bit of the bat actually goes

157
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:29,780
through a bit here in the middle which I

158
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:32,030
missed out I never mind that the lateral

159
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:33,560
geniculate nucleus and then we goes to

160
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,360
the human visual cortex over there

161
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,979
where it we get this entire visual

162
00:06:36,979 --> 00:06:40,430
processing happening going on so let's

163
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:42,139
go back from all the complicated things

164
00:06:42,139 --> 00:06:43,490
to stuff that you already know about

165
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:45,800
color now what I want you to do is you

166
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,710
see the black dots in the middle there

167
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:51,169
and we need to look at that try not to

168
00:06:51,169 --> 00:06:52,969
let your eyes move and I want you to

169
00:06:52,969 --> 00:06:56,020
look at that for about 15 or 20 seconds

170
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:58,430
just keep looking at it don't let your I

171
00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:01,490
track around just keep fixing looking at

172
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:12,379
that same black dot 15 20 ish do you see

173
00:07:12,379 --> 00:07:17,479
anything green right that's weird that's

174
00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:19,550
a white slide completely white slide

175
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:21,740
with the dot let's do that one again Oh

176
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:24,379
different colors time so look at the

177
00:07:24,379 --> 00:07:27,110
black dot trinocular eyes move just keep

178
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:36,089
looking at the black dot 10 seconds 15

179
00:07:36,099 --> 00:07:43,819
20 oh yes so these are called opponent

180
00:07:43,819 --> 00:07:46,370
colors why are we seeing this what

181
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:49,639
actually happened is the the rods that

182
00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:51,199
sort of the cones in your eyes use a

183
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:53,300
particular pigment which absorbs light

184
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:56,960
and over time if it keeps getting the

185
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,060
same input it kind of bleaches out he

186
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:01,370
gets tired and then if I suddenly switch

187
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:03,409
to white you'll see basically the

188
00:08:03,409 --> 00:08:05,270
inverse of that you'll see the opponent

189
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:07,460
thing what this tells us is that all

190
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:08,810
those nerves what they're doing is

191
00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:11,060
they're producing opponent colors colors

192
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:12,740
which are opposites of each other and

193
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:13,939
we're very good at detecting changes

194
00:08:13,939 --> 00:08:16,069
where something changes to its opposite

195
00:08:16,069 --> 00:08:19,639
color and you'll see the relevance of

196
00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:23,270
this later on when I get onto la be next

197
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:25,789
thing you need to know what what color

198
00:08:25,789 --> 00:08:31,759
is this yellow right it's a piece of

199
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:34,370
white paper which I took a photograph of

200
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:36,829
in a hotel room but I switched off the

201
00:08:36,829 --> 00:08:38,599
auto white balancing on the camera so it

202
00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:40,909
came out as yellow and if I have to do

203
00:08:40,909 --> 00:08:42,409
the same thing outside it would come out

204
00:08:42,409 --> 00:08:44,510
as light blue but if you are with me in

205
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:45,450
the room looking

206
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:46,980
that you and I look at it and say this

207
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:53,460
is white why because we evolved to be in

208
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:55,050
a constantly changing visual environment

209
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:57,960
the Sun goes behind a cloud and it takes

210
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,490
the light level down and it changes the

211
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:01,410
color balance and none of that is

212
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:03,270
relevant our eyes will just filter that

213
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:04,710
out and we will just see the scene as

214
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:06,660
having shifted slightly not all the

215
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:08,820
colors changed right so our eyes are

216
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:11,580
constantly doing white balancing we

217
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:13,410
adapt to whatever we think is the

218
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:15,990
brightest most white like white and all

219
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:20,300
the other colors shift to adapt to that

220
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:22,500
and if you don't do that then you get

221
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,390
things like this where people have wars

222
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:26,100
on the internet about exactly what color

223
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:32,100
dress was okay so color what we now know

224
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:34,460
about color is it's a subjective

225
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:37,770
sensation in the human brain and it's

226
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:39,660
caused by visible light acting on the

227
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:41,640
human eye and then been going through a

228
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:42,960
whole bunch of layers of neural

229
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,820
processing okay that's a great

230
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:48,020
definition that tells us about color

231
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:51,810
what how what can we do with this I mean

232
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:53,850
it's really complicated now if we want

233
00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:55,170
to know what a color is we're going to

234
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:56,970
have to measure how bright it is every

235
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:59,430
different wavelength like a spectrum and

236
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:00,810
then we're going to have to have

237
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:02,430
electrodes in the brain and measure all

238
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:04,320
the impulses from all the nerves and put

239
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,940
it all together and it's going to be

240
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:08,430
really complicated and we can't possibly

241
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:11,580
do this actually we can it turns out to

242
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:13,590
be simpler than that simpler than you

243
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:15,540
might think we can treat the entire

244
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:18,120
visual system as a black box we can say

245
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,190
here's the input tell us what the

246
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:22,410
outputs are like and we can build a

247
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:26,850
model from that so next stage imagine

248
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:28,170
that was all basics that was all the

249
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:30,840
easy simple stuff whoo-hoo so a

250
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,660
measurement you want to measure color

251
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:35,370
let's start off with this as a spectrum

252
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:37,140
this is a graph of how bright a

253
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:40,320
particular thing is at all the different

254
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,690
wavelengths from read through to violet

255
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:44,220
and you can see this has got all these

256
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:46,290
peaks so from that you can tell what

257
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:49,110
color it is right and these guesses what

258
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:51,960
color it is I couldn't tell you frankly

259
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,700
looking at this this is actually white

260
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:57,040
it's it's a light bulb

261
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:00,550
um from that you can't tell you can't

262
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:03,610
tell at all and you can have a totally

263
00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:05,709
different spectrum also looks white or

264
00:11:05,709 --> 00:11:07,690
green or whatever the color it was just

265
00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:09,430
the spectrum alone doesn't tell you what

266
00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:12,220
color it is what can we do about this

267
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:15,670
well looking at that graph we can see

268
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:18,339
that we actually know that brightness

269
00:11:18,339 --> 00:11:21,009
responds like this if in the greens and

270
00:11:21,009 --> 00:11:23,500
yellows we see a lot we see those colors

271
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:26,230
as very bright enough here in Reds we

272
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:27,910
see it as very dark and the same for

273
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:29,920
blues and violets so we already know

274
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,500
this this is one response that our I

275
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,240
producers and in fact there is a channel

276
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,490
coming out of our I into the brain which

277
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:38,560
is basically how light or dark is in a

278
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,870
particular area that we're looking at so

279
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:44,230
that's one thing remember I showed you

280
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:45,790
these cone responses so you can see

281
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:47,050
where that graph comes from it's

282
00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:48,190
basically you just add them up together

283
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:55,810
good well I've gone back why did you do

284
00:11:55,810 --> 00:11:58,660
that it's gone right back 20 tell me

285
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:00,730
that I'm not in a loop please don't let

286
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:06,310
me be in the loop yes good okay so a

287
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:09,190
visual matching and you can have

288
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:12,430
different spectral things and they look

289
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:14,500
the same even though the spectra are

290
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,329
different and we can use this to our

291
00:12:16,329 --> 00:12:19,510
advantage so here's an experiment this

292
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:21,790
was done in the 1930s so what we have is

293
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:24,010
two grand glass blocks and a person

294
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:26,730
looking and on this side we have three

295
00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:29,829
lights this one is 700 nanometers so

296
00:12:29,829 --> 00:12:33,190
it's a dark red and this one is 546 so

297
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:35,800
it's a yellow green and this one's 430

298
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:38,139
so it's like a violet color these are

299
00:12:38,139 --> 00:12:39,490
actually made with mercury vapor lamps

300
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:41,230
so they could do the same experiment in

301
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:43,600
different laboratories and always get

302
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,939
the same result and on this side we have

303
00:12:45,939 --> 00:12:48,010
the mystery light which is actually a

304
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:50,170
diffraction grating you've got you make

305
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:52,569
a rainbow you take one tiny slice of the

306
00:12:52,569 --> 00:12:54,670
rainbow you shown that and then you say

307
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:56,050
to them they've got three knobs or

308
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:58,029
sliders whatever and you say match that

309
00:12:58,029 --> 00:13:00,579
match that color keep moving these until

310
00:13:00,579 --> 00:13:02,579
you get the same color on both sides and

311
00:13:02,579 --> 00:13:05,260
then you do it again for a different

312
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:06,850
wavelength and so on and so on and you

313
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:08,200
have subjects who have an awful

314
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,270
patience because they have to do 700 of

315
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:17,460
these experiments to get the result so

316
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:20,830
you'll notice I've also got another set

317
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:22,540
of these lights on this side why is that

318
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:25,030
it turns out that sometimes for some

319
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:27,460
colors you could not match them at all

320
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:29,830
right you've got red turned all the way

321
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:32,620
down and you really wanted to make it

322
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:36,190
less red than that and the way you do it

323
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:37,960
is you cheat you put the colors on the

324
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,670
other side and you make the color trying

325
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:41,650
to match more red until it matches

326
00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:43,870
that's fine that's just a negative

327
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:47,350
number negative numbers aren't very

328
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:49,300
popular in 1930s because they're doing

329
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:51,160
all their mouth on slide rules and they

330
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:52,600
don't want that so they've got this

331
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,700
table of how to match with these three

332
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:57,190
particular weird lamps and they convert

333
00:13:57,190 --> 00:13:59,860
it to something called XYZ cie is just

334
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:01,810
that the organization that did these

335
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:04,780
experiments but ok XYZ gives you three

336
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:06,850
numbers and if two colors have the same

337
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:08,650
XY said value they will look the same

338
00:14:08,650 --> 00:14:12,220
they will be the same color to you so it

339
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:14,410
gets rid of the negative numbers also

340
00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:16,120
why is the luminance that was the graph

341
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,410
I showed you how bright particular

342
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:19,180
colors look so it gives you the

343
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:21,790
luminance straight away it's also an

344
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:23,620
additive color space what do I mean by

345
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:27,880
that if you have well that's actually we

346
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,590
do have there's a yellow light shining

347
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:31,450
there and there's a purple light shining

348
00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:33,100
there and if Martin was here he could

349
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:34,660
make these moving together so they

350
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:36,580
merged on the stage producer cover and

351
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:39,130
if I have the X Y Z value of that light

352
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:41,350
and that light and added them together

353
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:42,970
it would tell me the color of the

354
00:14:42,970 --> 00:14:44,230
mixture will appear in the middle I

355
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:45,910
could actually predict it you can do

356
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:48,190
math with XYZ and get the right result

357
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:53,080
so that's cool that's useful there's

358
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,700
some problems that exercise it here is a

359
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:57,670
graph of luminance from whatever it is a

360
00:14:57,670 --> 00:15:00,430
hundred 20 and you can see that mid gray

361
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:02,110
is a way over there which is not very

362
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:03,610
handy because it would be kind of useful

363
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:05,920
if it was in the middle so luminance is

364
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:10,730
not what we call perceptually uniform

365
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:13,630
another thing with XYZ is that white

366
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:15,820
adaptation isn't handled remember I

367
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:17,500
showed you the piece of white paper and

368
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,180
how we always see it as white even if

369
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:20,570
it's a yellowish lamb

370
00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:22,040
or if it's bright bluish daylight

371
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:24,530
however not only does that change white

372
00:15:24,530 --> 00:15:28,410
it changes all the other colors as well

373
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:31,850
so let's have a derived system will take

374
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:33,980
the active I said and will change it a

375
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:36,800
bit we'll take the Y component and we'll

376
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,810
put a bit of simple math on it so we get

377
00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:40,970
a scale which gray is in the middle like

378
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:44,270
that there that's the plus of L from

379
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:46,730
nought to 150 is right in the middle

380
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:50,540
great excellent much better than that

381
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:52,970
now we have a and B so we did these

382
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:54,830
opponent matching experiments together

383
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:58,310
we and we find that this this color here

384
00:15:58,310 --> 00:16:00,470
there we are that color hair if you

385
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:02,120
stare at it for a while you'll see that

386
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:04,730
color and this one this one if you stare

387
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:06,230
at it long enough you'll get that color

388
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:08,890
and so on so these are the two axes for

389
00:16:08,890 --> 00:16:12,440
colorfulness put that together and you

390
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:14,180
have a nice 3-dimensional color space

391
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:17,510
with lightness going up there and a and

392
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:21,020
B now the trouble with that actually you

393
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:23,240
try to match the color using RGB right

394
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,680
you've got three sliders and you're

395
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:26,750
trying to get the color and it doesn't

396
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:28,700
really work and you like oh how do i get

397
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:30,260
actually get there fast it is difficult

398
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:33,410
it'd be much easier if we looked at the

399
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:35,810
angle around from say the a axis and

400
00:16:35,810 --> 00:16:38,120
just went round like that how far round

401
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:41,570
and how far out so we can take a baby

402
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:45,410
and just take it from take it into a

403
00:16:45,410 --> 00:16:47,180
polar coordinate system like this and

404
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:49,640
then we get that that's nice so now we

405
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:51,290
have L coming out of the screen like

406
00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:53,720
this likeness and we've got Hugh as an

407
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,820
angle and at this point some of you are

408
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:57,800
thinking hang on I've seen all this

409
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:00,410
before I seen it before we've got hsl it

410
00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:02,540
is exactly the same thing doesn't it you

411
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:04,250
got white you've got black you got an

412
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:08,449
angle you've got a saturation if any of

413
00:17:08,449 --> 00:17:10,339
the other noticed that if you mix up

414
00:17:10,339 --> 00:17:15,199
blue right in hsl it has a lightness of

415
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:17,390
fifty percent and if you make such

416
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:19,939
yellow it has a lightness of fifty

417
00:17:19,939 --> 00:17:21,260
percent and does the blue and the yellow

418
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:24,050
look the same whiteness to you at all no

419
00:17:24,050 --> 00:17:26,240
yellow is much brighter the blue is much

420
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:31,169
darker if you do that in lch

421
00:17:31,169 --> 00:17:32,999
then it actually corresponds to how

422
00:17:32,999 --> 00:17:35,009
light it looks the yellow will have a

423
00:17:35,009 --> 00:17:37,559
lightness of about 70 and the blue will

424
00:17:37,559 --> 00:17:39,330
have a lightness of like 30 or 20 or

425
00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:41,279
something in other words it corresponds

426
00:17:41,279 --> 00:17:43,200
to what we see it corresponds to what we

427
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:48,419
can measure good so now you know that la

428
00:17:48,419 --> 00:17:50,909
B&L CH are basically the same thing one

429
00:17:50,909 --> 00:17:53,549
is polar one's rectangular it's actually

430
00:17:53,549 --> 00:17:55,529
a measured color you can get physical

431
00:17:55,529 --> 00:17:57,179
devices that you stick on something and

432
00:17:57,179 --> 00:17:58,999
measure the color it gives you a readout

433
00:17:58,999 --> 00:18:01,230
it's good so we can do that but now we

434
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:02,999
need to display these colors how do we

435
00:18:02,999 --> 00:18:07,649
do that first of all you characterize

436
00:18:07,649 --> 00:18:09,539
the display you measure the color of red

437
00:18:09,539 --> 00:18:12,119
and then of green and then a blue or

438
00:18:12,119 --> 00:18:14,309
separately at all the different levels

439
00:18:14,309 --> 00:18:19,139
for not so 255 and then you calibrate it

440
00:18:19,139 --> 00:18:21,239
you correct the imbalances you say okay

441
00:18:21,239 --> 00:18:23,249
at this value got this much lighter this

442
00:18:23,249 --> 00:18:25,379
one you've got this much light and you

443
00:18:25,379 --> 00:18:27,690
measure it so that the greys don't have

444
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:29,070
a little bit of a shifty a little bit of

445
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:30,299
shift there there are absolutely neutral

446
00:18:30,299 --> 00:18:32,369
graze all the way along and you also

447
00:18:32,369 --> 00:18:33,989
have a known white point whatever the

448
00:18:33,989 --> 00:18:35,850
white point you want to be as a

449
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:37,769
standardized white point you set it for

450
00:18:37,769 --> 00:18:41,879
that now let's talk about the gamut the

451
00:18:41,879 --> 00:18:43,649
gamut is not to be confused with gamma

452
00:18:43,649 --> 00:18:45,570
gamma is the shape of the transfer curve

453
00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:48,330
gamut is the range the volume of colors

454
00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:51,720
you can have so you've got la b and you

455
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,399
produce a volume there which is the

456
00:18:53,399 --> 00:18:55,590
range of colors a tiny one will not be

457
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:57,119
able to display very many colors and

458
00:18:57,119 --> 00:18:59,220
abroad one will be some fancy pro

459
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:02,539
monitor can display lots of colors

460
00:19:02,539 --> 00:19:05,129
you've probably seen this diagram by the

461
00:19:05,129 --> 00:19:06,359
way if you ever look at high-end

462
00:19:06,359 --> 00:19:07,950
monitors that will have this and I'll

463
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:09,480
have a little triangle here and it's a

464
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:10,919
this is better than this because it's

465
00:19:10,919 --> 00:19:13,440
got a big this is rubbish don't ever

466
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,700
trust this diagram this is a

467
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:17,309
chromaticity diagram it's a slice of XY

468
00:19:17,309 --> 00:19:19,379
said it is not perceptually uniform and

469
00:19:19,379 --> 00:19:21,149
remember I told you a perceptual uniform

470
00:19:21,149 --> 00:19:23,239
is the important thing so any

471
00:19:23,239 --> 00:19:25,739
calculations you do on this space will

472
00:19:25,739 --> 00:19:27,659
not give you correct answers ignore that

473
00:19:27,659 --> 00:19:32,460
instead what you want is that that's a

474
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:34,769
three-dimensional shape which I'm going

475
00:19:34,769 --> 00:19:36,869
to try to manipulate using this model so

476
00:19:36,869 --> 00:19:40,190
let's see can we do this

477
00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:46,379
okay so this is the gamut of srgb we've

478
00:19:46,379 --> 00:19:49,649
got the a and B axes there and then

479
00:19:49,649 --> 00:19:52,739
we've got the white point here there we

480
00:19:52,739 --> 00:20:01,440
go good

481
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:10,940
next slide come on

482
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:17,920
sigh okay this one is a much smaller

483
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:21,040
gamut you can see his smaller this one

484
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:24,940
is a little mac macbook air and it has a

485
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:28,420
less of a gamma 2 then srgb this one is

486
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:30,700
a high-end one ish unity it's got a much

487
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:35,710
larger space this is a broadcast space

488
00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:37,540
actually this if you go to a high-end

489
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:39,190
cinema now and it's got digital

490
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:41,530
projection it will use this gamma it's a

491
00:20:41,530 --> 00:20:44,380
thing called DCI p3 and I mentioned that

492
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:46,120
because when we get on to CSS color

493
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:47,530
again which we will do eventually I

494
00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:50,260
promise you'll see that DCI p3 is one of

495
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:55,480
the models you can use ok so now we need

496
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:56,940
to distinguish between device-dependent

497
00:20:56,940 --> 00:21:00,670
colors and device independent so

498
00:21:00,670 --> 00:21:02,440
device-dependent is kind of what we use

499
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:04,240
we have this RGB value and it looks

500
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,440
different on my screen it looks

501
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,880
different your screen it looks different

502
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,740
on the projector have you ever seen

503
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:10,809
people say i'm sorry i don't know like

504
00:21:10,809 --> 00:21:12,760
these colors look great on my monitor

505
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:14,440
but on the projector they seem to be all

506
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,120
different thatthat's thatthat's

507
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:19,929
device-dependent device-independent is

508
00:21:19,929 --> 00:21:22,179
where you say here is the measured value

509
00:21:22,179 --> 00:21:24,190
this is the actual color i want to

510
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:27,429
produce and then something some piece of

511
00:21:27,429 --> 00:21:29,620
software converts it to the RGB values

512
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:31,120
that's needed for the device you're

513
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:33,460
using so use instead of having the same

514
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:35,950
numbers everywhere in different colors

515
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:38,679
you have the same color everywhere and

516
00:21:38,679 --> 00:21:40,480
different numbers which it calculates

517
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:45,070
for you how are we doing for time we're

518
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:47,620
okay so I'm also going to talk about

519
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:49,059
Prince a little bit because it's the

520
00:21:49,059 --> 00:21:52,300
same procedure does anyone know what

521
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:54,490
this is this background diagram by the

522
00:21:54,490 --> 00:21:58,780
way G naught that is any suggestions is

523
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:01,300
anyone awake it's just that you don't

524
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:03,820
know ok that's fine that's fine this is

525
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:05,770
a dot pattern the thing is that the inks

526
00:22:05,770 --> 00:22:08,950
are opaque they're not transparent so if

527
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:12,130
you put say cyan ink on top of the

528
00:22:12,130 --> 00:22:15,010
genset ink what you see is cyan right

529
00:22:15,010 --> 00:22:16,570
you just covered one up with another you

530
00:22:16,570 --> 00:22:17,980
don't get a mixture they don't add

531
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:20,980
together because this is relying a lot

532
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:22,570
right

533
00:22:22,570 --> 00:22:24,100
sing off the paper coming into your eye

534
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:27,370
and you can't cover them up so you have

535
00:22:27,370 --> 00:22:29,919
this dot pattern and you put them all

536
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:31,840
the different angles so that hopefully

537
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,639
they don't cover each other up too much

538
00:22:33,639 --> 00:22:36,610
and you make a color by changing the

539
00:22:36,610 --> 00:22:39,730
size of the individual dots that's

540
00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:42,250
that's the way it is so how do you do

541
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:45,220
this well first of all so remember when

542
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:46,690
we're characterizing a screen you

543
00:22:46,690 --> 00:22:48,279
measured red and once you've done

544
00:22:48,279 --> 00:22:50,200
measuring red you measure green and then

545
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,250
you measure blue you don't have to

546
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:52,659
measure the combinations just the

547
00:22:52,659 --> 00:22:54,580
individual ones because it's additive if

548
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:56,860
we know what red is and what green is we

549
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:58,509
can make any of the colors of mixtures

550
00:22:58,509 --> 00:23:00,250
because it's an additive color specks in

551
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:02,620
print it's not additive so we have to do

552
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:05,440
all the different combinations lots and

553
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,299
lots of them like that we make all these

554
00:23:07,299 --> 00:23:10,059
patches and we measure every single one

555
00:23:10,059 --> 00:23:12,129
and that once you've done that once you

556
00:23:12,129 --> 00:23:13,750
buy a much more expensive instrument has

557
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:15,399
a robotic arm that measures more like

558
00:23:15,399 --> 00:23:16,690
this because it's really tedious

559
00:23:16,690 --> 00:23:20,399
otherwise so you measure those and then

560
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:23,200
what that tells you is for any given

561
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,360
combination of cyan magenta yellow and

562
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,879
black what actual color will I get and

563
00:23:27,879 --> 00:23:29,679
you got the measurement and the problem

564
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:32,259
we want to solve is the opposite given a

565
00:23:32,259 --> 00:23:34,149
particular color how much of these inks

566
00:23:34,149 --> 00:23:36,370
do I need which is a 4d reverse

567
00:23:36,370 --> 00:23:39,429
interpolation but the result is the same

568
00:23:39,429 --> 00:23:41,559
as on screens you've got neutral Gray's

569
00:23:41,559 --> 00:23:43,570
you were accurate colors you know how to

570
00:23:43,570 --> 00:23:45,669
mix up any particular color as long as

571
00:23:45,669 --> 00:23:48,639
the device can produce it then you know

572
00:23:48,639 --> 00:23:50,259
what cards if it can't produce you're

573
00:23:50,259 --> 00:23:51,669
stuck coming you you just can't produce

574
00:23:51,669 --> 00:23:56,230
more than it can do and you can save all

575
00:23:56,230 --> 00:23:57,820
the data having gone to all that trouble

576
00:23:57,820 --> 00:23:59,980
you want to save it somewhere and you

577
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:03,129
put this thing in an icc profile icc is

578
00:24:03,129 --> 00:24:04,960
the international color consortium and

579
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,700
they are the ones that made print

580
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:08,649
actually be reasonable so that you could

581
00:24:08,649 --> 00:24:10,509
go to different print shops and get the

582
00:24:10,509 --> 00:24:14,080
same result and that data is stored in

583
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:18,519
either XYZ at a lab as appropriate good

584
00:24:18,519 --> 00:24:22,750
now finally we Gonter CSS for color and

585
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:24,519
now you'll understand when i show you

586
00:24:24,519 --> 00:24:26,350
this Intex you actually know what it's

587
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:29,470
for so first of all css3 color here we

588
00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:32,590
go we've got RGB blah blah blah and on

589
00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:34,400
the wide gamut screen it looks correct

590
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,930
because that's what you mix it up on and

591
00:24:35,930 --> 00:24:37,790
then you look on an SI b screen and it's

592
00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:39,440
too pale because this is

593
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:43,130
device-dependent color now we can hack

594
00:24:43,130 --> 00:24:45,710
we can use media queries for and we can

595
00:24:45,710 --> 00:24:50,120
say do you support DCI p3 and if you do

596
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:52,670
who use this that's really horrible you

597
00:24:52,670 --> 00:24:54,440
wouldn't ever want to do this just in

598
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:56,030
different values so that they look the

599
00:24:56,030 --> 00:24:58,580
same now instead what you do is you use

600
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:01,940
lch which i already showed you the first

601
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:04,430
number in l CH is the lightness the

602
00:25:04,430 --> 00:25:07,100
second one is the chroma and the third

603
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:09,560
one is the hue the angle not to 360 and

604
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:12,260
then the browser calculates on four

605
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:13,970
different screens you will see the same

606
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:15,650
color five different screens you'll see

607
00:25:15,650 --> 00:25:20,000
the same color there we have asked the

608
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:25,490
syntax so we've got lc8 just like that

609
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:27,800
that's the simplest way these are all

610
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,660
numbers from nought to 100 apart from

611
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:32,780
the hue angle which is not to 360 you

612
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:34,760
can have decimals as what no you can

613
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:37,000
have as precise as you want this /

614
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:41,840
introduces the Alpha and if you have a

615
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,580
comer you can have a whole new color in

616
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:44,930
fact you can have several but this is a

617
00:25:44,930 --> 00:25:46,970
fallback so if you don't understand this

618
00:25:46,970 --> 00:25:51,920
syntax here's the srgb value so that's

619
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,480
lch which is the easiest one to

620
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:55,310
understand we've also got la b which is

621
00:25:55,310 --> 00:26:01,820
much the same functional notation so I

622
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:04,820
CC colors by default it's in srgb for

623
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:06,260
web compatibility that's what we've been

624
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:08,750
using so far but we've got predefined

625
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:11,330
display p 3 which is a sort of a

626
00:26:11,330 --> 00:26:13,340
reasonably wide gamut if you have a pro

627
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:15,410
mana so it will be wide gamut like that

628
00:26:15,410 --> 00:26:18,680
it will be display p 3 apple recently

629
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:20,750
introduced some phones which are also p

630
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:22,910
3 they've got some laptops which r p3

631
00:26:22,910 --> 00:26:24,410
and imax and the sort of thing it was

632
00:26:24,410 --> 00:26:25,790
actually Apple that pushed us to have

633
00:26:25,790 --> 00:26:28,370
this in the spec so there we are that's

634
00:26:28,370 --> 00:26:33,950
how you do it you say what space you

635
00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:35,390
using and then you give the values

636
00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:37,100
there's no commas between them because

637
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:38,840
the CSS working group has a war on

638
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:40,550
commas at the moment we want to

639
00:26:40,550 --> 00:26:42,230
eliminate them except where they used to

640
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:44,750
have lists of alternatives so get used

641
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:46,429
to that because it's going to be

642
00:26:46,429 --> 00:26:50,019
the challenge as the browser's cache up

643
00:26:50,019 --> 00:26:53,570
rec 2020 by the way is a huge ultra wide

644
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:55,639
gamut thing that was designed for 4k and

645
00:26:55,639 --> 00:26:58,850
NK television it displays almost all the

646
00:26:58,850 --> 00:27:00,590
visual colors you're not going to see

647
00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:02,149
one of those displays for a long time

648
00:27:02,149 --> 00:27:03,980
but you can actually use it you can

649
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:06,679
specify colors in it in CSS for color as

650
00:27:06,679 --> 00:27:11,240
well and media queries for as i

651
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:12,860
mentioned can check for support so you

652
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:14,570
can basically say I've do I have a wide

653
00:27:14,570 --> 00:27:16,249
gamut monitor because otherwise I won't

654
00:27:16,249 --> 00:27:18,200
bother I'll just here srgb but if you

655
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,759
have got it great i'll send you the

656
00:27:19,759 --> 00:27:24,049
other stuff instead and lastly CMYK if

657
00:27:24,049 --> 00:27:25,669
you're doing a style sheet for prints is

658
00:27:25,669 --> 00:27:27,889
how you will do it you have an appt rule

659
00:27:27,889 --> 00:27:29,149
here the same sort of thing as at

660
00:27:29,149 --> 00:27:32,419
font-face but in this case it points to

661
00:27:32,419 --> 00:27:35,029
a color profile on icc profile and then

662
00:27:35,029 --> 00:27:37,460
you can just use it so i give it a name

663
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:40,309
foo and then i say foo and here's the

664
00:27:40,309 --> 00:27:43,879
values in this forum CMYK that's it and

665
00:27:43,879 --> 00:27:48,110
that's device-independent CMYK actually

666
00:27:48,110 --> 00:27:50,600
so again you can send that to different

667
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:54,350
printers and it will understand it great

668
00:27:54,350 --> 00:27:57,230
so this is all interesting can you use

669
00:27:57,230 --> 00:28:00,950
it no no you cannot i'm telling you

670
00:28:00,950 --> 00:28:02,450
about something because it's going to be

671
00:28:02,450 --> 00:28:04,610
important in the future and because i

672
00:28:04,610 --> 00:28:05,840
have been trying for years to actually

673
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:07,940
get it into the browser's it's not in

674
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:09,889
the browser's yet well okay i lied it's

675
00:28:09,889 --> 00:28:11,990
in Safari nightly now some of it is

676
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:14,029
starting to get there Google are also

677
00:28:14,029 --> 00:28:15,740
interested in some of it is shipping

678
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:20,330
it's been weird because for like the

679
00:28:20,330 --> 00:28:22,759
last 10 years all of the major desktop

680
00:28:22,759 --> 00:28:24,200
operating systems have shipped with

681
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:26,720
color management enabled as part of the

682
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:30,649
OS and I was like great can get can we

683
00:28:30,649 --> 00:28:32,480
get it in the browser now a bit too soon

684
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,369
not yet his kind of specialized nobody

685
00:28:34,369 --> 00:28:36,529
really wants it but now with these wide

686
00:28:36,529 --> 00:28:39,559
gamut screens people do want it but then

687
00:28:39,559 --> 00:28:41,330
before that happened mobile happened and

688
00:28:41,330 --> 00:28:43,129
so as suddenly everyone had a little

689
00:28:43,129 --> 00:28:44,539
device this big and did it have color

690
00:28:44,539 --> 00:28:47,419
management on it no no it didn't haha

691
00:28:47,419 --> 00:28:50,419
but now it does now it does the newest

692
00:28:50,419 --> 00:28:51,559
version of

693
00:28:51,559 --> 00:28:53,659
I OS does in fact have color management

694
00:28:53,659 --> 00:28:57,409
and the new versions of Android which

695
00:28:57,409 --> 00:28:58,940
they haven't shipped yet but they tell

696
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:00,860
me they're going to will also have color

697
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:02,269
management so we're back in the

698
00:29:02,269 --> 00:29:04,309
situation of the OS supports it is just

699
00:29:04,309 --> 00:29:06,559
a case of having syntax in CSS to let us

700
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:10,879
use this feature the first working draft

701
00:29:10,879 --> 00:29:12,679
of this was only in July so it's fairly

702
00:29:12,679 --> 00:29:14,840
early days all of the specs by the way

703
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:17,059
from CSS working group are now on github

704
00:29:17,059 --> 00:29:19,220
so you can look at the spec you can see

705
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:20,840
the latest edits as soon as an editor

706
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:22,999
checks in an edit you can look at it you

707
00:29:22,999 --> 00:29:24,830
can look at issues you can add your

708
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:26,419
comments on them you can file a new

709
00:29:26,419 --> 00:29:27,860
issue for something in the specter you

710
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:30,259
don't understand file an issue say why

711
00:29:30,259 --> 00:29:31,519
is it like this why isn't it like that

712
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:33,529
people will talk to you it's much more

713
00:29:33,529 --> 00:29:35,149
open now it's a very good way to help

714
00:29:35,149 --> 00:29:39,110
specification development and that's

715
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:40,820
basically it these slides are online on

716
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:43,100
my github the spec itself as I mentioned

717
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:44,990
is also on github and they also wrote

718
00:29:44,990 --> 00:29:46,850
some code in JavaScript that does some

719
00:29:46,850 --> 00:29:48,350
of the color conversion so you can see

720
00:29:48,350 --> 00:29:51,320
how that works that's it I'm done
