1
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:08,790

all right so I am going to be talking

2
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:11,759
how to make your website not ugly which

3
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:13,080
I think everyone can agree is a good

4
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:16,890
thing yeah okay all right so a little

5
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:18,570
bit about me I'm a former journalist I

6
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:19,919
know there's actually a lot of former

7
00:00:19,919 --> 00:00:22,710
journalists here think okay yeah I was

8
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:27,390
kind of expecting some noise and I had a

9
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:29,130
stint as a print designer I've started

10
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:30,630
doing a little bit of web design but my

11
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:33,120
background is primarily as a software

12
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,930
developer ten-forward consulting and

13
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:38,519
medicine I also have a second to

14
00:00:38,519 --> 00:00:41,129
somebody we have some Guinan stickers

15
00:00:41,129 --> 00:00:42,600
because we're named for the bar in the

16
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,520
enterprise so if anybody wants the

17
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:47,329
guidance sticker come find me afterwards

18
00:00:47,329 --> 00:00:49,500
ten-forward we primarily work with

19
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,390
startups so a lot of times they don't

20
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:54,390
have a budget for a designer or for us

21
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:56,480
to do any kind of in-house design and so

22
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,649
this talk kind of originated because

23
00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:00,390
there was a lot of stuff that I knew we

24
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:01,620
should be doing but we didn't have

25
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:03,179
anyone who had the existing knowledge so

26
00:01:03,179 --> 00:01:04,559
I kind of had to figure it out myself

27
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:07,619
and then fun fact I read the second book

28
00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:09,570
of the storm white archives in one day

29
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:11,780
if anybody's a Brandon Sanderson fan

30
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:14,670
yeah it's a thousand eighty eight pages

31
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:18,000
I took a day off of work when I got it

32
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,200
because I knew I wouldn't be able to put

33
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,050
it down all right so we're gonna look at

34
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:30,030
a real website from 1996 Rae right

35
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:34,050
pretty attractive this is a senator's

36
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:35,989
website by the way this isn't just like

37
00:01:35,989 --> 00:01:38,369
some kid in their basement like I was

38
00:01:38,369 --> 00:01:41,899
making a terrible website this is like a

39
00:01:41,899 --> 00:01:44,489
congressional website so who thinks that

40
00:01:44,489 --> 00:01:51,030
this is well-designed okay okay I made

41
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:53,160
this this look is kind of like coming

42
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:56,910
back a little bit god forbid but right I

43
00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:58,170
mean most of us look at this and we

44
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:00,119
realize yeah this could probably be

45
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:02,160
improved so the point of that is you

46
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,840
know more than you think you do right so

47
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,580
even if you don't have any design

48
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:07,020
experience or when consider yourself

49
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:09,119
creative you can at least recognize when

50
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:10,709
something could be improved or when it's

51
00:02:10,709 --> 00:02:13,590
when it's really not working but why do

52
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:16,260
we care right doesn't it matter more

53
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:19,409
that what we're building works well so

54
00:02:19,409 --> 00:02:22,630
usability is a big one

55
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:24,970
it doesn't really matter if everything

56
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:26,530
works well if people don't know how to

57
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:27,220
find it

58
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:30,640
right credibility is another big one so

59
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,070
there's a study from Stanford University

60
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:35,080
they had ten different categories and

61
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,580
they asked people to rank the categories

62
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:39,700
by which one they felt gave them the

63
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:43,890
most trust in a website on first visit

64
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:47,380
46% of people said the visual design was

65
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:49,740
the most important that was the the

66
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:53,340
category that had the most votes

67
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:56,800
functionality was only 8% so especially

68
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,690
when we're first coming to his site we

69
00:02:58,690 --> 00:02:59,710
don't really care how it works is we

70
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:01,180
haven't gotten there yet we want to know

71
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:02,830
we want to be able to trust the website

72
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:05,760
and then interest is the last one so

73
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,980
this varies really widely depending on

74
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:11,590
what study you look at but it seems that

75
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:14,350
it's from about 10 seconds to 50

76
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:16,750
milliseconds is how long we have to

77
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:18,160
convince someone to stay on the site

78
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:21,010
before they bounce so maybe you're

79
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:23,620
thinking okay I'll buy it I'm listening

80
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:27,150
see we have to say disclaimer of course

81
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:29,650
there are always exceptions right so

82
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:30,670
everything I'm going to talk about today

83
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:32,860
are sort of broad guidelines depending

84
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:35,020
on the site or applications target

85
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:37,960
demographics the intended use you know

86
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:40,210
these are not going to necessarily apply

87
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:42,550
but they found in Sonya sonoran group

88
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:44,710
does a ton with UX and they revisited

89
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:46,630
some of their major findings from like

90
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:48,820
ten years ago twenty years ago to see

91
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:50,320
does is this still truth Suzy still

92
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,330
holed up and they found that usability

93
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:54,040
guidelines tend to be very durable so

94
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:57,250
the idea being that design trends and

95
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:59,950
patterns definitely change over time but

96
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:02,050
human behavior does not as anyone who

97
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:04,000
has dated an ill-suited partner knows

98
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,990
all too well so a lot to cover I'm going

99
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:09,070
to speak pretty fast because I have a

100
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:10,060
lot of things I want to get out and I

101
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:12,760
don't have a ton of time but you can

102
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:15,190
follow along I have my slides up online

103
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:18,549
and I'll have a link at the bottom and

104
00:04:18,549 --> 00:04:19,120
I'll have it later

105
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:23,170
so yeah all right so first we're going

106
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:25,080
to look at words and how we think about

107
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:28,360
text as like a visual element then

108
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:30,100
images when do we use them what kind do

109
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:31,330
we use how do we use them in the right

110
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:33,910
way and then design as kind of an

111
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:35,080
overall picture how do we think about

112
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:35,920
design from a lot

113
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:40,960
Cole perspective alright first we want

114
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,150
to make speech visual so there was his

115
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:47,650
28 2008 eye tracking study and they

116
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:49,900
found that visitors only read 20% of

117
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:53,290
text context on content on average so

118
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:56,200
how can we improve that first we want to

119
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,110
make sure that our text can breathe so

120
00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:00,550
lengths again depending on what study

121
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:01,870
you look at there's a lot of different

122
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:05,970
opinions about this but broadly speaking

123
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:09,880
people prefer my links that are shorter

124
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,590
so 50 60 characters per line but they

125
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:13,930
actually read faster at longer links so

126
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:15,610
the New York Times for example which I

127
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:17,500
use them for a lot of examples in here I

128
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:18,760
mean they're a site that's literally

129
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,860
meant for people to be reading giant

130
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:23,800
blocks of text and they keep their line

131
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:28,060
length at right around like 75 so kind

132
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:30,010
of anywhere between 60 and 100 is fine

133
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:31,720
again depending on what part of a site

134
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,520
it is but going longer than 100 people

135
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,320
start to they don't follow all the way

136
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:38,470
to the end of the line line height we

137
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:40,510
usually do about 1.4 again this depends

138
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:43,330
on what your typeface is this is not 1.4

139
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:46,780
pixels or EMS it's 1.4 times the font

140
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:49,090
size of the element and that tends to

141
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:50,620
you know again generally speaking that

142
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:53,260
works really well and then padding so we

143
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:54,820
do at least like 15 pixels because

144
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:56,290
especially if you have like columns of

145
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:58,420
text if the columns are too close people

146
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:00,910
just read straight across if they're too

147
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:02,200
far away people get to the end they

148
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,730
don't know where they're supposed to go

149
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:05,500
next so just making sure that you have

150
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,390
ample space around your text so that it

151
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:09,610
it's easy to follow the flow of what

152
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:12,730
you're trying to do so here's an example

153
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:15,790
of maybe not how to do it but you know

154
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:17,590
the lines are really close together you

155
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:19,660
can see that the text from the different

156
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:21,210
lines are actually touching each other

157
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:25,300
it's really wide I just look at this and

158
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:26,410
I immediately want to go check out

159
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:28,960
something else and here's how they

160
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,190
actually do it so this again is from The

161
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:33,370
Times so there's plenty of spacing but

162
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:36,010
it doesn't feel like there are gaps we

163
00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:38,680
can see that long column of white on the

164
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,790
side we're going to talk about that a

165
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:41,680
little bit later but like white spaces

166
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,370
your friend

167
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:46,450
it is not wasted all right and then it

168
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:49,960
has to be legible so contrast

169
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,700
there's a great website that I always

170
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:53,830
check all of my color combinations on

171
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:57,040
its web a morgue they have a contrast

172
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,630
checker and it checks with the wk

173
00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:00,700
standard so making sure that it's it's

174
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:02,590
compliant with accessible standards and

175
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:04,150
this is important because just because

176
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:05,830
you can read something doesn't mean that

177
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:08,230
everyone can read it right I think about

178
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:10,750
1 in 10 people in the US have some kind

179
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:13,540
of disability and that's a lot of people

180
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:16,930
and so a very easy way to make it easier

181
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:18,520
for folks to consume your content is to

182
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:20,560
just make sure that it's the contrast is

183
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,070
good size 16 pixel is as a browser

184
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:26,920
default for a reason especially as we

185
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,840
have an aging population who maybe is

186
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:31,030
having you know vision issues like it's

187
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:32,230
really important that your text is not

188
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:33,850
too small and again this depends on the

189
00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:36,790
type face so we just redesigned we're

190
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:38,710
redesigning our site and some of our

191
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:40,900
text we actually put the default at 20

192
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:42,790
because it just tends to be a smaller

193
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:47,110
more condensed typeface so who can read

194
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:51,520
this oh come on

195
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:55,990
I want your eyesight and I clearly could

196
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:59,470
not read that and then we've here right

197
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:01,120
and this still would not pass those

198
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,980
those standards for accessibility but

199
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:07,720
it's way better all right so then we

200
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:10,540
want to make our text scannable so like

201
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:12,370
we said earlier that study from 2008

202
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:14,050
people only read about 20% of text

203
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:18,400
content we lose people very quickly when

204
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,460
it's a text heavy page and so making

205
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:24,040
sure that they are able to scan through

206
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:26,680
everything will allow us to keep people

207
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,090
longer and I'm going to talk about this

208
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:28,870
a little bit later in the presentation

209
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:30,940
some ways to do this highlight the key

210
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:32,890
content using subheads

211
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:34,180
and this I thought was really

212
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:37,030
interesting we actually read faster when

213
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:39,070
text has a mix of uppercase and

214
00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:40,930
lowercase letters and it's not because

215
00:08:40,930 --> 00:08:42,640
that inherently is easier to read we're

216
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,010
just trained to read that and so when we

217
00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:46,420
see all caps are all lowercase it

218
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:48,670
actually takes us you know split seconds

219
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:49,720
longer to be able to process that

220
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:52,540
content well it would list another great

221
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:55,960
way to do it so this is the site where I

222
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:58,120
just kind of stripped out a lot of their

223
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,610
styling and if I come here I just see a

224
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:02,470
giant block of text I don't really know

225
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:03,430
what it's about

226
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:05,050
I have to I know that I have to invest

227
00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:06,970
at least a few minutes to figure out

228
00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:08,379
what they're even talking about to see

229
00:09:08,379 --> 00:09:10,420
if I'm interested in it and this is what

230
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:11,800
it actually looks like so we can see

231
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:14,259
it's very clear what the title is right

232
00:09:14,259 --> 00:09:15,910
that grabs my attention immediately

233
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:17,350
they have keywords at the top so I can

234
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:19,600
look at the keywords and see okay am i

235
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,899
interested in this is this worth my time

236
00:09:21,899 --> 00:09:24,339
they pull out the first paragraph and

237
00:09:24,339 --> 00:09:26,050
make it bigger they have sub heads so

238
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:28,180
maybe I see okay I know a little bit

239
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:29,980
about people scanning websites but maybe

240
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:31,089
there's something new in here that I

241
00:09:31,089 --> 00:09:32,439
don't know about so I'm gonna skim

242
00:09:32,439 --> 00:09:34,089
through the sub heads see if one catches

243
00:09:34,089 --> 00:09:35,649
my eye oh I didn't know about you know

244
00:09:35,649 --> 00:09:36,939
this new study let me read that

245
00:09:36,939 --> 00:09:41,379
paragraph all right keep decoration to a

246
00:09:41,379 --> 00:09:44,649
minimum so this is something that I

247
00:09:44,649 --> 00:09:47,889
think is is it's more attempting to not

248
00:09:47,889 --> 00:09:49,839
do this as there are so many different

249
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:51,009
you know like google fonts or so many

250
00:09:51,009 --> 00:09:53,189
different free typefaces that we can use

251
00:09:53,189 --> 00:09:56,500
and it's it's easy especially for like

252
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:57,699
clients that we work with to be like oh

253
00:09:57,699 --> 00:09:59,439
we want like six different typefaces

254
00:09:59,439 --> 00:10:04,449
no not gonna do that and here's why we

255
00:10:04,449 --> 00:10:06,009
usually pick like two or three so maybe

256
00:10:06,009 --> 00:10:08,019
we have one typeface that's dedicated to

257
00:10:08,019 --> 00:10:09,550
our headers and sub headers and one

258
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:12,660
that's for body text color is again so

259
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:15,519
two to three and the reason for this is

260
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:18,040
because when you have too many typefaces

261
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:20,019
or too many colors our brain

262
00:10:20,019 --> 00:10:21,819
instinctively assumes that it's an ad

263
00:10:21,819 --> 00:10:24,069
and we just completely skip that we

264
00:10:24,069 --> 00:10:26,110
don't even look at that content we just

265
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:29,500
skip it completely so again kind of

266
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,269
using more complex fonts or typefaces

267
00:10:31,269 --> 00:10:32,620
for the headers where the text is

268
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:34,120
probably bigger and then your simpler

269
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,589
ones for the body text which is probably

270
00:10:35,589 --> 00:10:38,949
going to be a little bit smaller so I'm

271
00:10:38,949 --> 00:10:41,230
not making fun of this website and

272
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:42,370
actually felt much better

273
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:44,230
about using this example in this

274
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:45,699
presentation because I saw that they

275
00:10:45,699 --> 00:10:47,920
redesigned it and it's much better now

276
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,750
but this is what it used to look like

277
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:53,350
and when I look at that site right first

278
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:54,430
of all I don't know where to go because

279
00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:55,809
there's a lot of different elements that

280
00:10:55,809 --> 00:10:57,910
are competing for my attention the nav

281
00:10:57,910 --> 00:10:59,920
isn't kind of an unusual spot that's not

282
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,809
where I would instinctively go to look

283
00:11:01,809 --> 00:11:04,689
for navigation I assumed that all of

284
00:11:04,689 --> 00:11:06,129
those squares at the bottom were ads

285
00:11:06,129 --> 00:11:07,000
because they all have different

286
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,649
typefaces the colors are all different

287
00:11:08,649 --> 00:11:10,899
font sizes all different and those are

288
00:11:10,899 --> 00:11:12,730
actually just like pages on this site

289
00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:15,630
there like programs that the church has

290
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:16,720
so

291
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,370
this is a better example like every time

292
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:19,629
that I go to this slide I just kind of

293
00:11:19,629 --> 00:11:24,129
like yes this is just nice it's very

294
00:11:24,129 --> 00:11:25,930
clear the navigation is where I expect

295
00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:28,050
it to be it's clear what page I'm on I

296
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:30,879
know what pattern I know at a glance

297
00:11:30,879 --> 00:11:33,189
what pattern this site is using to

298
00:11:33,189 --> 00:11:34,930
disseminate information and a big thing

299
00:11:34,930 --> 00:11:36,850
that I'm going to talk about is how you

300
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:38,290
want to make people learn one pattern

301
00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:40,660
and stick to it right we want to make

302
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:42,670
using our application or website as

303
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:47,050
painless as possible okay we recap quick

304
00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:48,910
so we want to think about speech as a

305
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:51,160
visual element within a website or

306
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,389
application so give it plenty of

307
00:11:52,389 --> 00:11:54,160
breathing room make sure it's legible

308
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,379
make it scannable so that people can

309
00:11:56,379 --> 00:11:57,730
skip around to what they're interested

310
00:11:57,730 --> 00:11:59,800
in and keep it simple not so many colors

311
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:02,519
or too many typefaces alright

312
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:05,550
we want to use our images appropriately

313
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:07,569
and early I don't think there's any

314
00:12:07,569 --> 00:12:09,129
situation where this image is not

315
00:12:09,129 --> 00:12:13,000
appropriate but that's another

316
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,709
conversation so icons a company that's

317
00:12:17,709 --> 00:12:19,480
actually called user testing which is a

318
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:22,059
little too on the nose but they studied

319
00:12:22,059 --> 00:12:25,209
190 icons in 2015 and they asked people

320
00:12:25,209 --> 00:12:27,279
what they asked people to predict what

321
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:28,569
would happen when they clicked on a

322
00:12:28,569 --> 00:12:31,149
particular icon so they found that if

323
00:12:31,149 --> 00:12:33,519
they gave them icons that were unique to

324
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:35,199
an application so for example Twitter

325
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:36,670
has the little like feather thing that

326
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:37,980
you click if you want to write a message

327
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:40,449
that one everybody knows but exempt you

328
00:12:40,449 --> 00:12:41,949
know icons like that that are unique to

329
00:12:41,949 --> 00:12:43,809
a specific application if they did have

330
00:12:43,809 --> 00:12:47,529
a label only 34% of people knew what it

331
00:12:47,529 --> 00:12:49,870
was going to do so that's like a third

332
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:51,819
of people so 66 or some people guess

333
00:12:51,819 --> 00:12:54,730
wrong if they use more generic Universal

334
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:57,670
icons again without a label 60 percent

335
00:12:57,670 --> 00:12:59,740
of people guess what it was going to do

336
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:01,509
correctly and if they put a label on

337
00:13:01,509 --> 00:13:03,430
those more generic icons than 80 percent

338
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:05,259
of people got it right but that's still

339
00:13:05,259 --> 00:13:09,100
you know one-fifth people didn't know it

340
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:10,329
was going to happen when they click that

341
00:13:10,329 --> 00:13:13,120
icon so the idea is kind of there are

342
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:17,800
maybe three like truly Universal icons

343
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:20,500
it just doesn't exist and especially if

344
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,059
you have an application that is used by

345
00:13:22,059 --> 00:13:24,250
an international audience I mean you

346
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:25,600
just you cannot assume that people know

347
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:30,419
what something is going to do

348
00:13:30,429 --> 00:13:32,079
so yeah labels are the rule not the

349
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:34,209
exception they work best often in a

350
00:13:34,209 --> 00:13:35,919
navigation or a menu setting that's kind

351
00:13:35,919 --> 00:13:37,509
of again where we expect them as well or

352
00:13:37,509 --> 00:13:40,329
if they're if you use them for

353
00:13:40,329 --> 00:13:42,309
decoration not as part of the actual

354
00:13:42,309 --> 00:13:43,839
like functionality and then avoiding

355
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:46,149
icons with conflicting meanings so I

356
00:13:46,149 --> 00:13:47,979
want everyone to think what icon would

357
00:13:47,979 --> 00:13:50,949
you choose to mean share just give

358
00:13:50,949 --> 00:13:54,999
people a second okay these are all icons

359
00:13:54,999 --> 00:13:56,619
that have been used in software to mean

360
00:13:56,619 --> 00:13:59,139
sure they all look completely different

361
00:13:59,139 --> 00:14:01,089
from each other some of them I really

362
00:14:01,089 --> 00:14:03,999
don't understand why they went that

363
00:14:03,999 --> 00:14:05,349
particular route but that just kind of

364
00:14:05,349 --> 00:14:06,879
goes to show right there there really

365
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:09,729
are very few Universal icons and you

366
00:14:09,729 --> 00:14:10,779
know some people have come up to me

367
00:14:10,779 --> 00:14:11,919
after this talking like well what if we

368
00:14:11,919 --> 00:14:13,359
put hover text on it well hover text

369
00:14:13,359 --> 00:14:16,419
doesn't work on mobile for one and also

370
00:14:16,419 --> 00:14:18,669
that is creating extra work for the user

371
00:14:18,669 --> 00:14:20,409
right we want to make it easy for people

372
00:14:20,409 --> 00:14:22,689
to interact with our content so if I

373
00:14:22,689 --> 00:14:25,449
have to admit if I have to put invisible

374
00:14:25,449 --> 00:14:28,509
work into understanding how something

375
00:14:28,509 --> 00:14:29,109
works

376
00:14:29,109 --> 00:14:33,639
I'm already just you know irate by that

377
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:35,859
experience and not really having a good

378
00:14:35,859 --> 00:14:38,889
time with it all right so then images

379
00:14:38,889 --> 00:14:42,809
who has heard of banner blindness a

380
00:14:42,809 --> 00:14:45,909
couple people okay so this is back in

381
00:14:45,909 --> 00:14:47,919
the days when I was building my Buffy

382
00:14:47,919 --> 00:14:50,769
the Vampire Slayer website and pretty

383
00:14:50,769 --> 00:14:53,669
much all sites had that like flashing

384
00:14:53,669 --> 00:14:56,829
rectangular ad right at the top if you

385
00:14:56,829 --> 00:14:59,169
remember that that was so ubiquitous

386
00:14:59,169 --> 00:15:01,539
that we started to instinctively ignore

387
00:15:01,539 --> 00:15:03,039
that section and we'll see that again in

388
00:15:03,039 --> 00:15:05,439
a little bit we just literally don't

389
00:15:05,439 --> 00:15:11,919
even look there now kind of realizing

390
00:15:11,919 --> 00:15:14,019
this this banner blindness people have

391
00:15:14,019 --> 00:15:15,669
started to put their ads elsewhere right

392
00:15:15,669 --> 00:15:16,809
so how many times when you're reading

393
00:15:16,809 --> 00:15:19,659
through like a news article and then it

394
00:15:19,659 --> 00:15:21,399
says like content continues after the ad

395
00:15:21,399 --> 00:15:22,569
and there's just an ad right in the

396
00:15:22,569 --> 00:15:24,369
middle of the text right that's kind of

397
00:15:24,369 --> 00:15:26,799
the new one of the new patterns but we

398
00:15:26,799 --> 00:15:28,149
skip that too you know I find that I

399
00:15:28,149 --> 00:15:29,949
notice what that is and I just don't

400
00:15:29,949 --> 00:15:31,239
even look at it I just skip down to the

401
00:15:31,239 --> 00:15:34,539
rest of the text so we we adjust for the

402
00:15:34,539 --> 00:15:39,249
patterns of ad placements so this ties

403
00:15:39,249 --> 00:15:42,499
into you know basic UX because you

404
00:15:42,499 --> 00:15:43,639
want to be aware of that right so don't

405
00:15:43,639 --> 00:15:45,529
put key content in these areas that we

406
00:15:45,529 --> 00:15:47,269
expect to be ads because we literally

407
00:15:47,269 --> 00:15:49,399
don't see them we just skip right past

408
00:15:49,399 --> 00:15:52,639
it make sure that your images are

409
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:54,319
integrating images or graphics are

410
00:15:54,319 --> 00:15:55,999
integrated with your content right so if

411
00:15:55,999 --> 00:15:57,949
if something is clearly a stock photo

412
00:15:57,949 --> 00:16:00,319
that brings down credibility if it seems

413
00:16:00,319 --> 00:16:03,169
not related to the content we again kind

414
00:16:03,169 --> 00:16:06,289
of assume it's an ad and it's just

415
00:16:06,289 --> 00:16:08,029
distracting so so news a Norman group

416
00:16:08,029 --> 00:16:10,159
they found that the first thing that

417
00:16:10,159 --> 00:16:11,539
users are drawn to on a website is

418
00:16:11,539 --> 00:16:15,709
actually plain text then faces so if you

419
00:16:15,709 --> 00:16:17,659
have like one of our clients had a blog

420
00:16:17,659 --> 00:16:20,989
and they kept wanting us to put more

421
00:16:20,989 --> 00:16:23,449
images into their blog just for the sake

422
00:16:23,449 --> 00:16:24,349
of having you but it's like all we just

423
00:16:24,349 --> 00:16:25,609
want to break up the text let's put some

424
00:16:25,609 --> 00:16:26,899
images in and we had to come back and

425
00:16:26,899 --> 00:16:29,059
argue like just getting a random stock

426
00:16:29,059 --> 00:16:32,389
image of a flag like actually detracts

427
00:16:32,389 --> 00:16:34,399
from your content right that makes it

428
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:35,959
look more like an ad that doesn't mean

429
00:16:35,959 --> 00:16:39,169
people want to read it so making sure

430
00:16:39,169 --> 00:16:41,059
that our images are informative and/or

431
00:16:41,059 --> 00:16:43,759
relevant right so maybe it's a picture

432
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:46,339
of the company team or someone using the

433
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:48,499
app or like a workflow image you know

434
00:16:48,499 --> 00:16:49,909
something that is actually related to

435
00:16:49,909 --> 00:16:52,879
the text that ties it together instead

436
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:57,649
of being distracting people have maybe

437
00:16:57,649 --> 00:16:58,819
seen this before this one's pretty

438
00:16:58,819 --> 00:17:00,069
popular

439
00:17:00,069 --> 00:17:02,959
they have also redone their website a

440
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:05,329
little bit if you go to links cars.com

441
00:17:05,329 --> 00:17:08,240
it's a little better I stuck with the

442
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,429
old one because it's worse and also

443
00:17:10,429 --> 00:17:13,220
because they now have a little graphic

444
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:15,679
on the top that says that even with that

445
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:17,029
terrible website they're still like the

446
00:17:17,029 --> 00:17:18,889
number one best-selling car dealer in

447
00:17:18,889 --> 00:17:22,309
the UK which is true there's like very

448
00:17:22,309 --> 00:17:25,189
successful but I think they you know

449
00:17:25,189 --> 00:17:26,539
this is the exception that proves the

450
00:17:26,539 --> 00:17:28,820
rule it's just very distracting I'm not

451
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:30,289
entirely sure what they're doing because

452
00:17:30,289 --> 00:17:36,039
you don't really see any cars here so

453
00:17:36,039 --> 00:17:38,720
yeah maybe maybe not where we want to go

454
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:41,779
on the other hand this kind of takes off

455
00:17:41,779 --> 00:17:43,909
all those boxes right the content it

456
00:17:43,909 --> 00:17:45,350
might be a stock image but at least it's

457
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:47,450
very related to the content of the

458
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:50,119
article it's integrated directly because

459
00:17:50,119 --> 00:17:52,159
we have the title going over the image

460
00:17:52,159 --> 00:17:53,600
so we can see that they are connected

461
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,100
they are part of the same thing

462
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:56,600
not like a standalone where we might

463
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:59,690
expect you to be an ad and it's simple

464
00:17:59,690 --> 00:18:04,269
its effective alright so another recap

465
00:18:04,269 --> 00:18:07,220
we want to think about speech from a

466
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:08,750
visual perspective right so how do we

467
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:10,370
make sure that we can read it that it

468
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:12,380
has enough space that it's easy for

469
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:15,470
people to to connect with we want to use

470
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:17,090
our images appropriately so icons should

471
00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:19,399
like seriously always have a label one

472
00:18:19,399 --> 00:18:20,690
thing I like to do if I'm gonna use an

473
00:18:20,690 --> 00:18:22,370
icon especially a unique icon for an

474
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:23,870
application is I go around to everyone

475
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:24,559
in my office

476
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:26,690
show them the icon ask them you know

477
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:28,789
within the context of the appliques and

478
00:18:28,789 --> 00:18:30,590
if they don't all give me the correct

479
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:32,090
answer then I don't use it I go back to

480
00:18:32,090 --> 00:18:34,539
the drawing board

481
00:18:34,539 --> 00:18:38,929
alright seven to ten I'm going to think

482
00:18:38,929 --> 00:18:40,730
illogically about our design this thing

483
00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:42,470
we we think logically about anything

484
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:44,470
else that we do

485
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:47,480
so patterns patterns are your best

486
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:51,230
friend if you are so for example

487
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:52,159
something that happens a lot in our

488
00:18:52,159 --> 00:18:55,009
office is we have an existing site that

489
00:18:55,009 --> 00:18:56,809
maybe we had a designer come and do and

490
00:18:56,809 --> 00:18:58,220
we use a template or you know whatever

491
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:00,259
the case is and the client wants to add

492
00:19:00,259 --> 00:19:04,250
a new page and so we end up building

493
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:05,629
that page from scratch and we just base

494
00:19:05,629 --> 00:19:06,649
it off the existing

495
00:19:06,649 --> 00:19:08,570
design so we look at what are the

496
00:19:08,570 --> 00:19:09,889
patterns that we've been using already

497
00:19:09,889 --> 00:19:11,539
right do we have a certain kind of

498
00:19:11,539 --> 00:19:13,070
column that we like to use do we have

499
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:14,419
like color banners that go all the way

500
00:19:14,419 --> 00:19:17,179
across that we can use one thing that

501
00:19:17,179 --> 00:19:19,669
our a designer friend of mine said once

502
00:19:19,669 --> 00:19:21,529
was like there are literally a billion

503
00:19:21,529 --> 00:19:23,539
websites so just find one you like and

504
00:19:23,539 --> 00:19:25,490
kind of copy it because for the most

505
00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:27,289
part what we're doing you know again

506
00:19:27,289 --> 00:19:29,720
this is where that's sort of like well

507
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:33,200
not all websites if you're building

508
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,909
something that that needs to have a

509
00:19:34,909 --> 00:19:36,289
unique design it needs to be really

510
00:19:36,289 --> 00:19:37,850
trendy and eye-catching like obviously

511
00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:40,549
you want to do something unique but in

512
00:19:40,549 --> 00:19:43,549
the most kit in most cases we just want

513
00:19:43,549 --> 00:19:47,389
something that looks good so quality

514
00:19:47,389 --> 00:19:51,649
Trump's originality in most cases find

515
00:19:51,649 --> 00:19:52,909
something that works use it as a model

516
00:19:52,909 --> 00:19:54,950
right just focus on the patterns I'm

517
00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:56,000
making sure everything is consistent

518
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,500
right that idea of like teaching our

519
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:59,269
user one pattern sticking to it so that

520
00:19:59,269 --> 00:20:00,740
it's very easy for them to navigate

521
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:02,059
through the site or application find

522
00:20:02,059 --> 00:20:04,879
what they're looking for so this is

523
00:20:04,879 --> 00:20:07,039
actually one of my favorite bars in

524
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,810
Madison

525
00:20:08,810 --> 00:20:10,400
this is our old site they got a new one

526
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,600
but they keep a link to that keep the

527
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,940
old one up for like nostalgia but this

528
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:15,680
was their real website until maybe a

529
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:18,550
year ago and it's completely useless

530
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:21,020
right I know nothing about the bar I

531
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:22,610
have no idea how all those st. Patty's

532
00:20:22,610 --> 00:20:24,380
Day pictures are because they've been up

533
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:28,100
there forever weird things are

534
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:29,870
highlighted weird things are bolded they

535
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:32,150
have multiple colors some things that

536
00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:33,560
are underlined aren't actually links

537
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:36,780
it's just kind of a hot mess

538
00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:39,530
here on the other hand we have I mean

539
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:41,870
it's this is like just patterns right

540
00:20:41,870 --> 00:20:44,470
everything is in patterns we have our

541
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:46,820
columns we have our navigation on the

542
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:49,820
side we can see the filters everything

543
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:51,590
is structured the same the squares are

544
00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:53,420
all the same size it's very easy to come

545
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:55,340
to this having never used it before and

546
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:59,150
be able to find what you want alright

547
00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:02,230
who's heard of progressive disclosure a

548
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:04,850
couple people okay so progressive

549
00:21:04,850 --> 00:21:06,980
disclosure is the idea of not

550
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:08,840
overwhelming users with content but

551
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:10,820
making it easy for them to find what

552
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:12,650
they're looking for so we're gonna talk

553
00:21:12,650 --> 00:21:14,780
about some ways to do that who is

554
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:15,920
familiar with the F shape reading

555
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:19,220
pattern more people okay so this is one

556
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:20,450
of those ones I mentioned earlier the

557
00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:22,400
durability of usability guidelines and

558
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,840
this is one that they went and revisited

559
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,550
he goes 20 years later and they found

560
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:28,750
that it's still true

561
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:31,760
so it's this right the red is where we

562
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,860
spend the most time looking at a site

563
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:36,020
and then the blue and clears always been

564
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:37,490
the least time so we can see there's

565
00:21:37,490 --> 00:21:40,040
this sort of broad F shape so we start

566
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:43,490
in the top I don't know left and right

567
00:21:43,490 --> 00:21:46,640
left corner and then we kind of cascade

568
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,770
down and again you can see that the

569
00:21:48,770 --> 00:21:52,930
intensity of our consumption of content

570
00:21:52,930 --> 00:21:56,240
drastically like tapers off the farther

571
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:59,020
down that we get they found that for

572
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:01,880
languages that are flipped from English

573
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,310
so where you read the opposite direction

574
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:06,050
the FC pattern is still there it's just

575
00:22:06,050 --> 00:22:07,790
flipped kind of like you would expect so

576
00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:10,480
this is this is kind of a universal

577
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:16,250
behavior so top to bottom important to

578
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:18,830
less important right they found that in

579
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:20,720
2014 they found that a hundred and fifty

580
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,490
six percent more people

581
00:22:22,490 --> 00:22:24,680
see you know sort of like above the fold

582
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:27,290
so in newspapers the above the fold was

583
00:22:27,290 --> 00:22:28,700
literally above the fold right if you

584
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:29,750
were holding a physical newspaper in

585
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:31,400
your hands they put the eye-catching

586
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,140
stuff at the top because they wanted you

587
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:35,360
to be invested enough that you would

588
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,070
bother to actually open the newspaper

589
00:22:37,070 --> 00:22:39,260
and that same behavior right human

590
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:40,970
behavior does not change we just ported

591
00:22:40,970 --> 00:22:43,100
that behavior over to the web but

592
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:44,870
instead of a fold we have a scroll so

593
00:22:44,870 --> 00:22:46,670
it's kind of like before the scroll so

594
00:22:46,670 --> 00:22:48,950
100 see 6 percent more people look at

595
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:54,200
the content before the scroll so what we

596
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,460
want to make sure that we are we are

597
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:56,750
drawing people at the top so really

598
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:59,120
getting our our key concepts at the top

599
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,010
of the page and then avoid putting

600
00:23:01,010 --> 00:23:02,840
content in this traditional ad area so

601
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:06,680
if we go back to look at here right we

602
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:08,150
can see that we don't even look at the

603
00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:10,190
top for the most part that whole top

604
00:23:10,190 --> 00:23:12,710
section we don't even look at part of

605
00:23:12,710 --> 00:23:14,150
that is banner blind as part of that is

606
00:23:14,150 --> 00:23:15,440
that we now kind of expect that a

607
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,060
navigation is there and we first get to

608
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:18,950
a site we're not necessarily interested

609
00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:20,060
in the navigation right we want to

610
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:21,260
figure out well what are they about

611
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:23,270
do I care and if I care then maybe I

612
00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:27,900
want to go click for something specific

613
00:23:27,910 --> 00:23:29,960
so here's a good example right again

614
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:31,310
from the New York Times so we can see

615
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:33,310
that in that area that we don't look at

616
00:23:33,310 --> 00:23:36,320
they just put other stories it's like if

617
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:39,590
we click on those great if we don't not

618
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:41,990
the end of the world they have a nice

619
00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:44,480
big title I know exactly what this is

620
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:49,160
about the image is like very relevant to

621
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:49,790
the content

622
00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:54,080
I have subheads so I can kind of scroll

623
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,640
through see what I'm looking for they

624
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:57,590
understand that you know and you can see

625
00:23:57,590 --> 00:24:00,440
there's almost an F on this page right

626
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,120
they understand the way that we are

627
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:03,500
going to interact with the content and

628
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:04,310
so they decide with a bunch of

629
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:05,480
whitespace there because we're not

630
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:07,160
looking there anyway like why bother

631
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:12,560
putting something there alright so again

632
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:14,480
with consistency right if there's one

633
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,550
thing you leave with today it's a

634
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:18,770
consistency in patterns in design are

635
00:24:18,770 --> 00:24:22,670
like your best friend so links and

636
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:23,750
buttons right idea if a button has a

637
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:25,100
shadow one place it should probably have

638
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:26,810
a shadow all the time forms should have

639
00:24:26,810 --> 00:24:29,480
the same color if you have like alerts

640
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:34,470
the red should be the same color tables

641
00:24:34,470 --> 00:24:35,970
should look the same your header

642
00:24:35,970 --> 00:24:37,470
typefaces and size it should be the same

643
00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:39,120
and now you know we have some sites

644
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:42,030
where that are very very data heavy so

645
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:43,620
like for the University so they're just

646
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:45,929
literally looking at data from research

647
00:24:45,929 --> 00:24:48,390
projects and so tables for like one

648
00:24:48,390 --> 00:24:49,620
category you might have like a different

649
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:51,990
color for the header right so that they

650
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:53,400
can use that it as a visual cue to see

651
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,270
what they're looking at but otherwise

652
00:24:54,270 --> 00:24:55,770
everything is the same because we want

653
00:24:55,770 --> 00:24:57,390
to make it again we want to make it easy

654
00:24:57,390 --> 00:24:59,070
for people to find what they're looking

655
00:24:59,070 --> 00:25:06,270
for so which part of this text do you

656
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:08,190
think is the link is that the green or

657
00:25:08,190 --> 00:25:11,700
is it the underlined yeah no one

658
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:13,140
answered because like you have no I'm

659
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:14,520
going unless you click on something is

660
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:16,530
it you know it's the green maybe where

661
00:25:16,530 --> 00:25:18,299
you hover and it gives you that sort of

662
00:25:18,299 --> 00:25:20,580
weird definition or it wants you to

663
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:22,789
click somewhere else to go somewhere I

664
00:25:22,789 --> 00:25:25,110
look at this and I have to stop and

665
00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:27,090
think and what I don't want is to think

666
00:25:27,090 --> 00:25:29,039
about how the content works

667
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:30,960
I want to you know ideally I'm thinking

668
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,520
about the content itself and like you

669
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:33,570
know it's thoughtful and deep and

670
00:25:33,570 --> 00:25:35,520
whatever but I don't want to think about

671
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:39,000
how to interact with it so functionality

672
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,360
is a part of design the structure so I'm

673
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:44,429
a full site developer so I do beckon in

674
00:25:44,429 --> 00:25:48,120
rails and then front-end and on a new

675
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:49,860
project or even if I'm just adding to

676
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:51,059
the architecture of an existing product

677
00:25:51,059 --> 00:25:52,650
I think about how the data models can

678
00:25:52,650 --> 00:25:54,390
have a direct impact on the user facing

679
00:25:54,390 --> 00:25:56,490
implementation so I sit then I think

680
00:25:56,490 --> 00:25:59,400
okay what am I likely building out on

681
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:01,049
the front end in the interface that

682
00:26:01,049 --> 00:26:02,669
someone's gonna use how can I make sure

683
00:26:02,669 --> 00:26:05,340
that I am sort of preparing for that to

684
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:09,679
be a you know like a cooperative

685
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:12,539
misadventure which is like kind of a

686
00:26:12,539 --> 00:26:13,650
business phony word but you know what I

687
00:26:13,650 --> 00:26:14,880
mean like how can I think about how they

688
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:17,260
work together

689
00:26:17,270 --> 00:26:20,220
bugs Trump Beauty right so we saw that

690
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:22,679
46% of people saying that visual design

691
00:26:22,679 --> 00:26:24,059
is the most important for building

692
00:26:24,059 --> 00:26:26,210
credibility versus 8% for functionality

693
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:28,710
but if you decide to stay on a site

694
00:26:28,710 --> 00:26:30,450
because of the visual design and then

695
00:26:30,450 --> 00:26:32,220
the links are all broken in the forms

696
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:34,380
don't submit you're not going to stay

697
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:34,860
anyway

698
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:40,070
right so this I really like this quote

699
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:42,179
design is where science and art break

700
00:26:42,179 --> 00:26:44,880
even so the idea that you know I think a

701
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:47,370
lot of people when they hear visual

702
00:26:47,370 --> 00:26:48,220
design they think

703
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:52,120
that it's it's not really you know

704
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:53,200
especially if you're more of a back in

705
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,220
partner but they think it's not really

706
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:55,840
relevant to what I'm doing right the

707
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,280
code is one thing the visual design is

708
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:58,659
another thing but they all fit together

709
00:26:58,659 --> 00:27:02,110
and impact each other and if we're aware

710
00:27:02,110 --> 00:27:04,360
of that then we can like really build

711
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:09,789
kickass all right final recap so we

712
00:27:09,789 --> 00:27:10,750
want to think about our words as a

713
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:12,730
visual construct right how do we make

714
00:27:12,730 --> 00:27:14,440
sure that they are able to be read

715
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:18,490
easily and quickly images icons should

716
00:27:18,490 --> 00:27:20,830
always have labels photos and graphics

717
00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:22,510
should be integrated with the content

718
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:25,150
relevant informative stock images are

719
00:27:25,150 --> 00:27:26,710
not your friend because we look at text

720
00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:28,090
first that's what we're drawn to then we

721
00:27:28,090 --> 00:27:30,669
look at faces random flag pictures are

722
00:27:30,669 --> 00:27:33,760
just like whatever and then how do we

723
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,690
think about design from a logical

724
00:27:34,690 --> 00:27:37,030
perspective right so using patterns and

725
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:39,039
being consistent keeping in mind that F

726
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:40,510
shape reading pattern and how that

727
00:27:40,510 --> 00:27:44,470
