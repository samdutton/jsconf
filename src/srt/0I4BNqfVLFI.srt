Calendar / Kalender (aka, the fun of locali[zs]ation)
Paul Verbeek-Mast

2
00:00:35,839 --> 00:00:36,839
[Applause]
PAUL: Thank you.

3
00:00:36,839 --> 00:00:37,839
This is the last part of my name, it's Verbeek-Mast,
recently got married and added my girlfriend's

4
00:00:37,839 --> 00:00:39,850
last name to it.

5
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:47,229
Up until last week I was working at Booking.com
as a front end developer, but I've now joined

6
00:00:47,229 --> 00:00:52,350
a start-up in the Netherlands called SpronQ
and I'm also an organiser of the Fronteers

7
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:59,229
conference this year, which will be the 10th
anniversary, which is cool.

8
00:00:59,229 --> 00:01:08,689
So I will also not tell you what it all says
but it talks about localisation of a calendar

9
00:01:08,689 --> 00:01:16,759
that we did at Booking.com, so these are almost
all - these are part of the languages that

10
00:01:16,759 --> 00:01:20,500
we localised in, it was 42.

11
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:25,640
We did not localise in Klingon even though
I really wanted to.

12
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:37,130
Let me tell you what my talk is not about,
about things we already know, that date and

13
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:39,759
time is difficult.

14
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:44,240
If you really want to know what we all think
that's incorrect about time there is a cool

15
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:53,771
article called Falsehoods Programmers Believe
About Time and, if that's not enough, there's

16
00:01:53,771 --> 00:01:59,549
still More Falsehoods Programmers Believe
About Time and you can look them up.

17
00:01:59,549 --> 00:02:02,310
Very, very cool.

18
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:09,810
As I said, I was working at Booking.com and
we had this calendar that we used for people

19
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:16,750
that own an apartment or a small hotel, and
where they can see their reservations, change

20
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:22,050
the prices and things like that but the problem
was it wasn't actually a calendar, it was

21
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:28,260
like this infinite scrolling list where you
couldn't see any data on, you have to click

22
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:33,629
three times before you can get the real data,
so we got a lot of feedback from our users

23
00:02:33,629 --> 00:02:42,040
that it didn't really look like our calendars
that they were using the competitor with the

24
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:49,310
red logo, which I cannot tell, so we decided
to change the calendar.

25
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:56,510
We did some user research about what we wanted
to do and so we did implementation and we

26
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:58,569
started out with making some sketches.

27
00:02:58,569 --> 00:03:04,200
This sketch was made by someone else this
morning, but it's still a cool sketch, but

28
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:14,240
we started out with some sketches and implemented
our front end and then actually we used Perl

29
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:18,420
at Booking.com so we had some Perl code and
you actually don't want to touch a lot of

30
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:24,730
that so we tried to just use the code that
was already there and that was it for the

31
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:25,730
calendar.

32
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:27,150
But then we needed to localise.

33
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:35,511
There are 42 different countries at Booking.com
and even more regions so if you are German

34
00:03:35,511 --> 00:03:43,120
you will know this date format is not really
how it looks in Germany and also you are used

35
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,120
that the euro sign is at the end.

36
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,519
Things like that.

37
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:56,299
If you look at the US, it will actually - a
week will start at Sunday; the date format

38
00:03:56,299 --> 00:03:58,060
is completely different.

39
00:03:58,060 --> 00:03:59,799
The price is dollars.

40
00:03:59,799 --> 00:04:06,099
And for those dates things, we actually decided
to use Moment.js.

41
00:04:06,099 --> 00:04:12,400
Also not to talk about Moment.js, I will briefly
go through it, what we did use, but Moment.js

42
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:17,950
has very good localisation data as well.

43
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:26,280
This morning Matt was talking about js-joda
and date - it's not the right name - date

44
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:31,730
functions, it should be, and about the ECMAScript
temporal proposals, if you want to know about

45
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:36,260
those, just go and watch his talk when it's
online.

46
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:42,530
So we had this - say we have this sketch,
we implement this sketch, and we wanted to

47
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:46,390
add the names of the weeks all along the top.

48
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:51,680
We need to know: well, what does the first
day of the week start with?

49
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,980
It starts with Sunday or Monday?

50
00:04:54,980 --> 00:05:00,920
You can easily get that with Moment.js, with
locale data, you can get the first day of

51
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:07,190
the week and return with a 0 or 1 and then
you can get the names of the week in the locale

52
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:14,641
which you've selected which will in this case
generate Sunday through Saturday, and we use

53
00:05:14,641 --> 00:05:16,650
that at the top.

54
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:24,190
Then we needed to get the first day of the
month - well, first day of the calendar which

55
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:27,780
is interesting because it's not the first
day of the month.

56
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:35,740
So we used - we could just use start of month
and then start of week, and then get the number

57
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:41,820
of the date, and the same goes for the end
of the month.

58
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:43,490
Then just fill them all out.

59
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:51,310
So that was easily to generate the first part
of the calendar.

60
00:05:51,310 --> 00:06:00,100
Then I needed to find what kind of format
does this country use?

61
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:07,630
It's not always - it wasn't very easy to find
but it was somewhere in a more private variable

62
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:13,690
called long date format, and then we used
a capital L, and that was basically it.

63
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:19,100
So I'm going to go through this very fast
but just to get a sense of what we were kind

64
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:22,160
of working with.

65
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:28,280
This was basically the localisation then for
all the languages, very easily.

66
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:34,540
So then we went on the testing and just going
through the languages to see if everything

67
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:42,250
is okay, and then I hit the bump that I always
forget, and that is RTL, which stands for

68
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:44,510
right to left languages.

69
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:55,120
Those are languages like Arabic or Hebrew
so if you have this calendar it's not only

70
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,460
this script that goes from right to left,
you actually want to change everything from

71
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:04,090
right to left so for example you want to switch
the right column to the left, and then also

72
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:16,590
switch everything around as well so that your
Monday also starts on the right side, your

73
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:19,020
week.

74
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:24,830
So this is all done in CSS, so you just change
your float left to your float right, your

75
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:27,910
margin left to your margin right.

76
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:32,740
If you have something inline or inline block
it will automatically go right.

77
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:40,020
The only thing is the two arrows, we switch
the functionality around because if you click

78
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:44,170
on the left arrow you want to go to a month
in the future instead of the past.

79
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:50,800
We could have just rotated the arrows which
would have been easy with CSS.

80
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:59,550
So we just clicked through everything, fixed
a few bugs and then we went on to more testing.

81
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:05,110
If you want to know about unit testing at
Booking.com, you can give me a few beers later

82
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:08,490
on and I will tell you a whole lot about unit
testing at Booking.com.

83
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:12,200
I don't work there anymore so I can now tell
you everything I know.

84
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:17,470
[Laughter]
But what we did was we added just a whole

85
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:23,690
bunch of our users into a beta group, not
asking them, because why would you ask them?

86
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:28,830
Just put them in a beta and then add a feedback
at the top where they could do a thumbs up

87
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:34,450
and a thumbs down and get a little bit of
feedback, just a text area.

88
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:38,599
What do you want to know about users giving
you feedback?

89
00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:40,479
It is not always that useful.

90
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:48,029
Most of the time it's just very short strings
like - well, these were the positive ones.

91
00:08:48,029 --> 00:08:54,790
"We finally have a much better overview and
love the new interface."

92
00:08:54,790 --> 00:09:04,500
But they already give you a long thing about
how their life is and how good the calendar

93
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:09,990
is in their life and how they finally found
the right person that they want to be with

94
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:13,810
just because you have the new calendar.

95
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:17,149
There's weird stories in there which I will
not show.

96
00:09:17,149 --> 00:09:22,949
But there's also just some bad things like,
"Hate it, bring the old one back", without

97
00:09:22,949 --> 00:09:25,639
saying why they hate it, and, "Who made this?"

98
00:09:25,639 --> 00:09:33,829
Smiling chocolate ice cream, I think.

99
00:09:33,829 --> 00:09:40,910
But if you really dig into the feedback you
will find some obscure things that they will

100
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:45,040
tell you which you have to dig through your
code to figure out what was actually going

101
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,209
on.

102
00:09:46,209 --> 00:09:51,750
Because these are bug reports and not in the
sense that you yourself would write a bug

103
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:58,250
report but, "Hey listen, your reservation
is not showing up", and great, what now, because

104
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:01,710
I cannot contact the person really.

105
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:07,810
So what I did do is I saved not enough data.

106
00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:09,380
That was a big mistake for me.

107
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:15,820
I just saved their user ID and the language
that they selected and I should have done

108
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:20,790
the user agent and a whole bunch of other
things but I was lazy and I implemented too

109
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:22,680
late, which is a mistake.

110
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:26,519
Don't be too lazy with these kind of things.

111
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:32,500
So I had two things to work with, to do some
bug fixing and those four examples that I

112
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:36,170
will just give you, that I just gave you,
I will go through them because these were

113
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:42,110
the four most interesting things that I found
and which caused me a lot of detective work

114
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:45,629
to figure out what it was.

115
00:10:45,629 --> 00:10:52,060
We had some reservation data on our calendar
as well so it showed you more than just a

116
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:57,410
blue bar, it showed you the name and things
like that but one person - it's just one random

117
00:10:57,410 --> 00:11:00,880
person said: well, my reservations aren't
showing up.

118
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:04,709
They gave a little bit more data about which
specific reservation that didn't show up and

119
00:11:04,709 --> 00:11:10,040
it was in October 2016, this is reservation,
the 15th or 16th, it just wasn't there for

120
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,630
him.

121
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:16,329
And it was weird because I had tested it,
it was working, that's how it usually goes,

122
00:11:16,329 --> 00:11:23,149
it works on my machine, but for him it didn't
work and you don't want that because they

123
00:11:23,149 --> 00:11:27,439
will get overbookings and lawsuits.

124
00:11:27,439 --> 00:11:31,980
So first off, just looking through my code
to see if I could figure out anything which

125
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:36,550
was a problem and then I thought: well, it
must be some localisation thing because that's

126
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:44,160
mostly where the problems originate at Booking.com
and I figured out this person lives in Brazil.

127
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:50,310
So first step: changing the language to Portuguese.

128
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:55,740
Specifically Brazilian Portuguese because
we have that in the website.

129
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:57,569
I couldn't reproduce the bug.

130
00:11:57,569 --> 00:12:08,279
So next step: I changed the time zone on my
laptop to be minus 3 because I saw that they

131
00:12:08,279 --> 00:12:14,980
were based in the capital, and it still didn't
show up.

132
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:16,700
I couldn't reproduce the bug.

133
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:20,459
Then a colleague sitting next to me said:
here's the bug, I have it.

134
00:12:20,459 --> 00:12:21,459
What?

135
00:12:21,459 --> 00:12:22,459
What did you do?

136
00:12:22,459 --> 00:12:25,370
He said: well, I switched to Portuguese, changed
the time zone to minus 3.

137
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:30,509
Well, okay, let's just check out any other
settings that we might have and we couldn't

138
00:12:30,509 --> 00:12:37,579
figure it out for a very long time until I
noticed there's a Wiki page on time in Brazil

139
00:12:37,579 --> 00:12:46,220
which gives you a lot of weird data like their
Summer Time is different when they have carnival

140
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:54,680
during the time when they would normally switch
to Summer Time but also that not their entire

141
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:59,879
country adheres to Summer Time.

142
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:06,209
I thought it couldn't be Summer Time, it's
October, but I was just forgetting one of

143
00:13:06,209 --> 00:13:11,779
the falsehoods I believe about time which
is Summer Time is always true in my summer,

144
00:13:11,779 --> 00:13:18,740
which is not true for their hemisphere, of
course, because Summer Time starts in October.

145
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:27,259
So my colleague selected capital of Brazil
as his time zone and I selected a city just

146
00:13:27,259 --> 00:13:34,309
north of Brazil, and that city north of Brazil
didn't adhere to Summer Time and the capital

147
00:13:34,309 --> 00:13:41,869
did adhere to it, so I found a crappy piece
of code that I wrote which compared two different

148
00:13:41,869 --> 00:13:48,350
dates and there was one thing that says "add
one day", and I learned that in Moment.js

149
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:55,820
"add one day" does not mean add one day; it
sort of does, but it just adds 24 hours.

150
00:13:55,820 --> 00:14:03,089
Compared with this, it basically meant the
day was never going to be the same because

151
00:14:03,089 --> 00:14:09,990
the day would be one day, and day 3 would
be midnight.

152
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:14,360
By the way, smart quotes, not fun.

153
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,819
The day there.

154
00:14:15,819 --> 00:14:16,819
Sorry.

155
00:14:16,819 --> 00:14:22,850
So I just switched them around and that was
fixed.

156
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:25,550
[Laughter]
Great.

157
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:32,139
I could also fix my code to make it better,
but I was leaving anyway.

158
00:14:32,139 --> 00:14:35,339
So another thing is: why are closed dates
red?

159
00:14:35,339 --> 00:14:42,970
A very obscure question but they came up in
a different kind of string so I could figure

160
00:14:42,970 --> 00:14:49,030
out that it said: this date, if they closed
it, so I don't accept any reservations, we

161
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:50,649
show this red bar.

162
00:14:50,649 --> 00:14:54,199
Well, that's good, right?

163
00:14:54,199 --> 00:14:55,199
So what do you think of this?

164
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:58,920
Is this a good day at the stock market?

165
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:04,410
I wouldn't think so, but this is a very good
day at the stock market because in eastern

166
00:15:04,410 --> 00:15:11,810
Asia, red often means that it's something
good instead of something bad.

167
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:18,259
So their convention is something is closed
and you are showing this is good?

168
00:15:18,259 --> 00:15:23,350
It's not very fun because sometimes you show
that it's good even though they close it because

169
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:27,189
they have a funeral or something, and you
don't want to do that, so we switched it around

170
00:15:27,189 --> 00:15:33,779
to make it grey and that was neutral enough
for people, so learning from this, just watch

171
00:15:33,779 --> 00:15:42,689
out with colours because you can do things
wrong for some countries.

172
00:15:42,689 --> 00:15:47,319
So the third one is that the day selection
is not working.

173
00:15:47,319 --> 00:15:53,240
This was our date selection, with a From and
a To, and when you click on it, it showed

174
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:56,190
your jQuery, your date picker.

175
00:15:56,190 --> 00:15:58,379
Why jQuery UI date picker?

176
00:15:58,379 --> 00:16:05,319
Well, because we had already used it and we
are just re-using things.

177
00:16:05,319 --> 00:16:15,389
At first, it's not a big problem but you cannot
see what date and what month it is so you

178
00:16:15,389 --> 00:16:21,029
have to get the date format for a moment to
see: okay, this is month, day, year.

179
00:16:21,029 --> 00:16:24,999
Then, if you want to change that, if you want
to connect it with the date picker you can

180
00:16:24,999 --> 00:16:30,309
do parse date and then it says month, day,
year, and you add the date.

181
00:16:30,309 --> 00:16:33,459
But this gives an error.

182
00:16:33,459 --> 00:16:38,980
This does not work because jQuery UI uses
this format.

183
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:48,980
Month, day, year, lower case, and then the
year changes to yy, so I created a little

184
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:51,059
script for it.

185
00:16:51,059 --> 00:16:55,019
I already did this, so it was before the bug
showed up.

186
00:16:55,019 --> 00:17:02,980
So I created a script, put it - by the way,
I hope you will not need it - but the problem

187
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:05,910
with this script led in this part.

188
00:17:05,910 --> 00:17:10,690
If you were here a couple of talks before
about regular expressions, this is a very

189
00:17:10,690 --> 00:17:17,670
easy regular expression, it kind of finds
the slashes and dashes in the day format,

190
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:20,151
you have to figure out where the delimiters
are.

191
00:17:20,151 --> 00:17:25,450
If you are from Germany you've probably already
figured out a problem because most complaints

192
00:17:25,450 --> 00:17:28,380
come from German users.

193
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:34,680
It also needed a dot because the format in
Germany mostly is a dot in between, so I thought:

194
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:43,430
well, what the hell, let's just change it
to /W and then be done with it.

195
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:48,990
Most people didn't report a bug anymore except
for one country, and I told you that I saved

196
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:54,260
the language of the country, and I actually
saved the full language name, so I saved this

197
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:57,630
for the country that was the problem.

198
00:17:57,630 --> 00:18:01,700
So I thought: okay, which language is that?

199
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:05,311
So I used my very great tool for that, Google
Translate.

200
00:18:05,311 --> 00:18:10,460
Google Translate said: okay, I've detected
this is Slovenian.

201
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:13,260
Are there any in the room by the way?

202
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:17,010
Any Slovakians in the room?

203
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:24,780
So the top one is Slovakian, and the bottom
one is Slovenian.

204
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:25,960
It's a slight difference.

205
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:31,180
So after I checked it's Slovenian and thought:
still not seeing the bug - and then it says

206
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:38,610
in the bottom, "Did you mean this?", and I'm
like, "No, not really!"

207
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:45,300
So Google Translate does know that this word
is in Slovak because if you just change the

208
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:50,280
word to Slovak, it translates it, so what
was the problem here?

209
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:55,310
The date delimiter was dot space.

210
00:18:55,310 --> 00:18:58,530
Great.

211
00:18:58,530 --> 00:19:05,750
So just adding a plus to my regular expression
fixed everything.

212
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:11,360
Maybe something else is broken but at least
it fixed this.

213
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:15,640
The last thing that I want to show you has
nothing to do with date or time; it has something

214
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:19,540
to do with the prices that weren't showing
up properly.

215
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:25,060
So we have the reservation, we have the number,
we also showed the prices.

216
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:29,730
Showed up perfectly fine.

217
00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:39,240
We checked and nobody ever had a price that
was higher than 99,000 euros, so should be

218
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:41,000
fine.

219
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:46,130
But yeah, not always.

220
00:19:46,130 --> 00:19:57,510
So this was 1 million Indonesian Rupiah, I
think, so it's not always just about dates

221
00:19:57,510 --> 00:20:02,800
and times, it's also about prices, it's about
changing the colours, it's about cultural

222
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:05,650
differences as well.

223
00:20:05,650 --> 00:20:12,210
I think I went a little bit too fast but my
conclusion to wrap this up is a couple of

224
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:17,040
things: so do not make any assumptions.

225
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:21,960
That's basically what a lot of people have
already said at a number of different conferences

226
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:26,760
but even if you read all the assumptions that
people make about date and time there's a

227
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:30,610
lot of assumptions that you are probably going
to make.

228
00:20:30,610 --> 00:20:32,960
And localisation is not just translation.

229
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:37,410
Translation is a part of localisation.

230
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:38,410
It's more than that.

231
00:20:38,410 --> 00:20:39,820
It's cultural differences.

232
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:45,770
It's date and time, it's colours, not just
about date and time but also colours and things

233
00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:46,770
like that.

234
00:20:46,770 --> 00:20:52,900
Gathering meaningful feedback, so not to do
things that I did, it's gathering feedback

235
00:20:52,900 --> 00:21:00,380
from the users, it's great, but just save
their user agent, save the URL that they are

236
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:06,933
on, save maybe the way you look at languages,
so maybe instead of the Slovenian or the Slovakian

237
00:21:06,933 --> 00:21:14,650
word that I said, just save SK which makes
more sense for programmers.

238
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:15,920
And bugs will happen.

239
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:22,280
It doesn't matter how much you test it, it
doesn't matter how much experience you have

240
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:26,640
in localisation, every time you do something,
bugs will happen and they will always be there,

241
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:30,760
even if you fix all the bugs that people are
reporting.

242
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:37,610
It will still be localisation bugs because
sometimes people are just used to localisation

243
00:21:37,610 --> 00:21:42,190
issues, and change their language to English
just so that they know this probably works

244
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:43,640
better.

245
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:50,620
But localisation is still important because
if you don't have German language, a lot of

246
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:55,800
people can't use your website and you will
say I don't have a lot of Germans on my website.

247
00:21:55,800 --> 00:22:00,310
You need to change your language.

248
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:03,810
It's about accessibility.

249
00:22:03,810 --> 00:22:11,770
And bug fixing is like being a detective,
kind of like being a travelling detective,

250
00:22:11,770 --> 00:22:16,090
because I feel like I have travelled to all
different kinds of regions just to figure

251
00:22:16,090 --> 00:22:18,270
out what the problem was.

252
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:22,080
I didn't actually travel because if that was
the case that I could travel for bug fixes

253
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:25,060
I might still be working at Booking.

254
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:30,890
So have fun with your bug fixes and just feel
like that you are actually trying to find

255
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:35,400
something that no one else has ever done before.

256
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,860
So thank you very much.

257
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:42,110
This is my Twitter handle, if you want to
follow Fronteers, this is the Fronteers Twitter

258
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:43,110
handle.

259
00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:45,150
My email address - I love getting emails.

260
00:22:45,150 --> 00:22:47,030
This is my ICQ number.

261
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:48,030
Thank you very much.
