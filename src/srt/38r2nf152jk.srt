Trans Eye for the Cis Ally: Ensuring an Inclusive
Community

Julien Fitzpatrick
>> I'm kidding\h I do\h I love that song.

3
00:00:07,689 --> 00:00:09,780
I know all of the words to that song.

4
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:10,980
So, I don't know if I'll be able to do karaoke
tonight because it's really late for me because

5
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:12,610
it's like three hours later inside of my body
than it is here.

6
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:13,610
So, but if I can, I will sing that song in
karaoke, I promise.

7
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:14,610
Yes.

8
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:15,610
All right.

9
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:16,610
So, I am extremely, extremely excited for
our next presenter.

10
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:17,610
This is a topic that is very near and dear
to my heart.

11
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:18,610
I am always trying to be a better ally.

12
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:19,610
And I think it really speaks volumes about
this community and the values that this community

13
00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:20,610
holds that we have a talk like this interspersed
with all of the amazing cool, wow tech stuff.

14
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:21,610
So, Julien Fitzpatrick is gonna be teaching
us about how to be a trans ally and build

15
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:22,610
more inclusive spaces.

16
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:23,610
So, give it up for them.

17
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:24,610
Are you ready?

18
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:25,610
Yeah.

19
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:26,610
Give it up for Julien.

20
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:27,610
[ Applause ]
JULIEN: Hello, what's up, everybody?

21
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:28,610
Welcome to trans eye for the cis ally.

22
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:29,610
My name is Julien, I use they/them pro nouns.

23
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:30,610
I used to be a cartoonist, now a software
engineer.

24
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:31,610
I have been working as a programmer for the
last four and a half years or so.

25
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:32,610
I work at a company called Artemis.

26
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:33,610
This is an indoor agriculture management platform.

27
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:34,610
We are hiring, of course.

28
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:37,280
So feel free to talk to me later.

29
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:42,730
In my spare time, I enjoy power lifting, hanging
out with my really cute dog.

30
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:47,300
His name JPEG.

31
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:51,910
That always gets a really big laugh from programming
conferences.

32
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:57,149
I like to obsessively read about Freddie Mercury's
life.

33
00:00:57,149 --> 00:01:02,340
And finally, I'm like kind of a Queer Eye
super fan.

34
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:05,170
So, what is Queer Eye?

35
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:10,320
Before we get to the actual topic of the talk,
I feel like I should give a little background

36
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,730
regarding Queer Eye just so we're all on the
same page.

37
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:18,730
Queer Eye is a show on Netflix, currently,
that on its surface is a makeover show.

38
00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:25,780
Five gay guys take one person each episode,
make over their hair, clothes, their house,

39
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:31,890
their cooking ability, but most importantly,
their feelings.

40
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:36,360
Usually it's someone who's had kind of a hard
time in their life and they've struggled and

41
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:41,720
the fab five, as they're called, come together
to help them get their whole life together.

42
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:45,540
Almost every episode of the show ends up being
pretty emotional.

43
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:50,270
So, if you've never watched it before and
you really to want watch a feel good kind

44
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:55,000
of tearjerker show, I would recommend it.

45
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,330
I should also mention that before I go on,
even though I'm definitely a super fan of

46
00:01:58,330 --> 00:01:59,840
the show, I don't think it's perfect.

47
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:04,830
There have been a lot of really valid critiques
about aspects of the show.

48
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:08,140
Even though I'm not going to talk about those
things right now, I'm happy to talk about

49
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:11,540
various critiques of Queer Eye in the hall
or on Twitter.

50
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:14,820
If you want to do that, let me know.

51
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:19,670
So, moving on, what does this have to do with
what we're talking about right now?

52
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:22,100
This talk is called trans eye for the cis
ally.

53
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:27,860
Which is after the original Queer Eye, called
Queer Eye for the Straight Guy.

54
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:29,370
I've never watched the original.

55
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:31,240
Don't talk to me about it.

56
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:35,380
I don't know that much about it at all.

57
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:38,240
It's honestly pretty different from what I've
heard from the modern one.

58
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:44,350
In this case, I'm the trans eye and you're
probably the cis ally.

59
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:48,070
If you're here, you are likely interested
in making your workplaces and events more

60
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:49,930
inclusive for trans people.

61
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:52,170
Which is great.

62
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:56,360
The truth is, there are so many small things
and some larger things that you can do to

63
00:02:56,360 --> 00:03:01,470
not only give your existing trans coworkers
and community members a good experience, but

64
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:07,250
also to make sure that even if you don't currently
have any trans coworkers or community members,

65
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:12,060
you're providing a space and experience that
will be welcoming in the future.

66
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:13,670
So, let's start with the basics.

67
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:17,630
Not even the basics, but like the basics of
the basics.

68
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:19,569
So, what is trans?

69
00:03:19,569 --> 00:03:22,090
What is cis?

70
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:26,250
The simple answer is that trans means you
don't identify\h or transgender means you

71
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:30,300
don't identify with the gender you were assigned
at birth.

72
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:31,300
That's it.

73
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:36,560
Not everybody who feels this way ends up identifying
with or using the word trans to identify themselves.

74
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,690
But the word is there if they want to use
it.

75
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:45,390
For example, a trans man was assigned female
at birth and figured out later that he was

76
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:46,390
male.

77
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:50,370
And a trans woman would be someone who is
assigned male at birth and later realized

78
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:52,120
that she was female.

79
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:55,050
It's not that complicated.

80
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:56,050
Yeah.

81
00:03:56,050 --> 00:03:58,200
Cis just means you do identify as the gender
you were assigned at birth.

82
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,310
That's most people.

83
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:04,530
If the doctor said it's a boy when you were
born, and you're a boy, congratulations, you're

84
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:05,530
cis.

85
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:07,290
Not hard.

86
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:16,150
Transgender and cis\h people can't be transgendered
and cis gendered.

87
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:20,459
We jokingly say this, I trans'd you.

88
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:23,240
But you can't do that.

89
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:26,040
If you want to be respectful, use the words
correctly.

90
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:33,950
And non binary, you're somewhere outside of
the male/female binary.

91
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:38,100
There's a few common misconceptions about
what non binary means.

92
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:42,110
It doesn't mean gender neutral or androgynous.

93
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:46,870
Or assigned female at birth and leans masculine.

94
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:50,770
Non binary, it could mean that for some people.

95
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:55,900
There's not one way to be non binary or two
or three ways.

96
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:59,620
It means you don't fit into the binary and
this is the word you have chosen to describe

97
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:00,680
yourself.

98
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:04,780
Technically, it falls under the trans umbrella.

99
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:09,320
So, some non binary people don't consider
themselves trans.

100
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,630
This is fine.

101
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:14,250
If someone tells you they're non binary and
they're not trans, just say cool.

102
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:15,860
Serve different.

103
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:20,020
It's okay if you don't understand.

104
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:25,370
Something really important that cis people
don't get is it's okay for you to not understand

105
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:29,560
trans people in order to respect us and treat
us with dignity.

106
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:32,220
I don't know what it's like to be cis or straight.

107
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:35,840
It doesn't stop me from being able to respect
others.

108
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:39,690
You don't have to totally understand what
it's like to be someone in order to respect

109
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:42,120
someone.

110
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,669
Pronouns are a really good example.

111
00:05:43,669 --> 00:05:47,350
So, when someone first comes out as trans
or you meet a trans person.

112
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:49,570
They might want to use different pronouns.

113
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:55,120
To you, they might not look like someone who
uses the pronouns.

114
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:59,460
Or maybe they/them pronouns and you have never
done that before.

115
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:00,460
Try.

116
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:04,669
All you have to do is try, you don't have
to get it.

117
00:06:04,669 --> 00:06:11,210
If you mess up, just quickly apologize, correct
yourself, don't make a big deal out of it

118
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:13,770
and eventually it will be second nature to
you.

119
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:20,310
So, while we're talking about pronouns, I
should mention as an aside that a person's

120
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:23,030
pronouns are just a person's pronouns.

121
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:24,699
My pronouns are they/them.

122
00:06:24,699 --> 00:06:27,540
It's become common for people to say preferred
pronouns.

123
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:30,920
But only when they're talking about trans
people.

124
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:31,960
Everybody has pronouns.

125
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:36,110
They're not preferred, they're just pronouns.

126
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:40,139
Also worth mentioning, some people have done
this in my life in the past.

127
00:06:40,139 --> 00:06:44,380
Some people think they can use they/them for
everyone because it's a simple solution to

128
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:47,080
having to remember the pronouns for everybody.

129
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:49,060
This is not great.

130
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:55,229
If you have a trans person using he/him pronouns,
and you call him they, you're still mis gendering

131
00:06:55,229 --> 00:06:56,820
him.

132
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:57,820
Think of it this way.

133
00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:02,330
You have to think of different names for everyone
you know.

134
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:07,639
There's probably three different gender pronouns
that you have to learn.

135
00:07:07,639 --> 00:07:11,130
Compared to learning all those names, it's
honestly not that hard.

136
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:17,330
So, now that we've discussed some basics,
let's move on to the next level and talk about

137
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:22,510
what you can actually do right now to make
things better and more welcoming for trans

138
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:27,199
and non binary people at your company or your
event or your meetup group or whatever.

139
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:29,949
So, back to pronouns.

140
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:35,420
For me, as a non binary, it's impossible for
someone to guess what my pronouns are just

141
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:37,390
by looking at me.

142
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:41,979
My life is a series of awkward situations
in which I have to figure out how to tell

143
00:07:41,979 --> 00:07:49,330
a single person or a few people or a whole
room of people they use they/them pronouns.

144
00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:51,750
This is the case for binary trans people too.

145
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:55,790
Just because I have to do it all the time
doesn't mean I'm good at it.

146
00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:57,070
Or that I'm used to it.

147
00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:59,190
I kind of hate it.

148
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:05,090
So, a really simple way to mitigate this is
just be proactive and make sure that people

149
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:08,130
are given every opportunity state their pronouns.

150
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:13,270
At the beginning of a meeting when a new person
is interesting introduced to the company or

151
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:17,330
whatever, just have whoever is running the
meeting start by being, like, my name is so

152
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:18,330
and so.

153
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:20,570
My pronouns are, you know, they/them or he/him.

154
00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:24,840
And just have all the employees just kind
of be an example.

155
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,970
Make it a normal thing.

156
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:32,010
If you have an employee page on your website,
you can have people include their pronouns.

157
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:37,050
This also helps prospective employees know
that you tend to be a trans inclusive space.

158
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:41,339
It's something I look at when I'm looking
at people's job pages.

159
00:08:41,339 --> 00:08:45,120
If they have pronouns, cool.

160
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:49,800
Honestly the bar\h it's slightly above the
worst.

161
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,639
That's great.

162
00:08:51,639 --> 00:08:55,040
So, same goes for events.

163
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:59,790
Anywhere a person's name is listed, if they
want to include their pronouns you can include

164
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:00,899
their pronouns as well.

165
00:09:00,899 --> 00:09:05,050
You can offer pronoun stickers or pins like
we have here.

166
00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:09,800
Or just have a way people can write their
pronouns on their badges large enough that

167
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,350
people can see them easily.

168
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:14,079
Something I really like about these pins actually.

169
00:09:14,079 --> 00:09:18,290
I have been to a lot of conferences with a
lot of pronoun things and I like this because

170
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:20,740
you can read it easily, it's large.

171
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:21,980
You can put it anywhere you want.

172
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:23,980
You can make is visible.

173
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:28,829
I think that's the best solution.

174
00:09:28,829 --> 00:09:33,949
Even if you're cis, put the pin on and whatever,
write your pronouns.

175
00:09:33,949 --> 00:09:37,899
Because you can encourage other people to
do the same.

176
00:09:37,899 --> 00:09:41,050
Just make sure like when you introduce yourself
to people you say your pronouns.

177
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:43,000
Just, you know, that sort of thing.

178
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,899
So, this picture of pronoun stickers is from
a meetup where I live in Portland.

179
00:09:46,899 --> 00:09:51,509
That's called Donut.JS, which is pretty great.

180
00:09:51,509 --> 00:09:55,610
Yeah, make sure people know if they're interviewing
candidates to introduce themselves with their

181
00:09:55,610 --> 00:10:00,730
name and pronouns and ask if the candidates
want to do the same.

182
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:05,240
Your company or event has a Slack, make sure
everyone know they can include their pronouns

183
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:09,470
or have the leaders include their pronouns
in the profile.

184
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:11,860
Make it a thing not only the trans people
have to deal with.

185
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:14,160
It kinds of sucks.

186
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:17,440
And also something I haven't written in my
notes.

187
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:20,999
I'm going ad lib, whoa.

188
00:10:20,999 --> 00:10:25,769
Something people talked about and mentioned
a few times is you shouldn't force people

189
00:10:25,769 --> 00:10:27,329
to share their pronouns.

190
00:10:27,329 --> 00:10:28,329
That's also a thing.

191
00:10:28,329 --> 00:10:33,089
Like, it's great to be really encouraging
about it, but some people are in the closet

192
00:10:33,089 --> 00:10:34,639
and it sucks.

193
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:35,929
Even though it's totally understandable.

194
00:10:35,929 --> 00:10:39,100
I'm going to refer to you with a third person
pronoun.

195
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:40,470
Tell me what you want to use.

196
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:45,920
It's so stressful for people in the closet
to have to think about it and put the wrong

197
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:48,699
one up.

198
00:10:48,699 --> 00:10:51,100
I've had people tell me that before when I
talk about pronouns.

199
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:52,649
I wanted to mention that.

200
00:10:52,649 --> 00:10:53,649
Don't force people.

201
00:10:53,649 --> 00:10:59,449
But, you know, encouraging and if you know
you're cis, put your pronoun on.

202
00:10:59,449 --> 00:11:05,670
So, on that note, you might to want consider
if you do have a trans employee or a co worker,

203
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:11,730
you might to want ask them what, if anything,
they want you to do if another employee mis

204
00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:13,269
genders them.

205
00:11:13,269 --> 00:11:17,989
Don't assume everyone is bold enough to correct
other people, especially if they're new.

206
00:11:17,989 --> 00:11:22,069
And on the same token, don't assume they want
you to say or do anything.

207
00:11:22,069 --> 00:11:24,059
Leave it up to them.

208
00:11:24,059 --> 00:11:25,970
But find out in advance.

209
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:33,220
I can say\h depending on the person, it could
happen constant lily for them and it's gonna

210
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:34,220
come up.

211
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:36,779
So, you want to know the right response ahead
of time.

212
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:42,459
On that note, if you've hired a trans person
or someone has just come out to you as trans

213
00:11:42,459 --> 00:11:46,309
and you're wondering if something is okay,
you should not assume.

214
00:11:46,309 --> 00:11:47,579
You should ask.

215
00:11:47,579 --> 00:11:50,179
So, for example, you have a non binary employee.

216
00:11:50,179 --> 00:11:54,839
This is actually a thing that happen to me
at my old job when I came out.

217
00:11:54,839 --> 00:12:00,179
So, usually when you go to conferences you
have like\h so, in our case we previously

218
00:12:00,179 --> 00:12:05,079
had an even split of male and female employees
and we would share hotel rooms at conferences.

219
00:12:05,079 --> 00:12:11,130
But instead of just assuming which person
I wanted to room with, my boss was like, hey,

220
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:14,059
how do you feel about this?

221
00:12:14,059 --> 00:12:15,470
Which person do you want to room with?

222
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:17,149
Do you want your own room?

223
00:12:17,149 --> 00:12:19,069
That sort of thing.

224
00:12:19,069 --> 00:12:21,740
Yeah, don't assume what people want.

225
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:23,170
Just ask.

226
00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:25,209
But also sometimes don't ask.

227
00:12:25,209 --> 00:12:30,110
So\h so, like, stuff like that, yeah.

228
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:31,110
You should ask.

229
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:34,589
But there's a ton of thing that is you should
never ask.

230
00:12:34,589 --> 00:12:38,589
Luckily this is, I think, really easy to figure
out.

231
00:12:38,589 --> 00:12:40,310
But it still happens all the time.

232
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:45,089
So, think like before you ask somebody a question,
ask yourself if it would be okay to ask a

233
00:12:45,089 --> 00:12:47,379
cis employee.

234
00:12:47,379 --> 00:12:50,939
It's not okay to ask a trans employee if it's
not okay to ask a cis employee.

235
00:12:50,939 --> 00:12:53,579
So, don't ask if they've had the surgery.

236
00:12:53,579 --> 00:13:00,240
Like, the surgery is like some abstract concept
that is not real.

237
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:03,779
So, just\h it's ridiculous.

238
00:13:03,779 --> 00:13:04,779
Anyway.

239
00:13:04,779 --> 00:13:08,179
Don't ask literally any question that has
to do with their body.

240
00:13:08,179 --> 00:13:10,910
But especially their genitals.

241
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:13,989
Like, you know?

242
00:13:13,989 --> 00:13:16,639
Don't ask invasive medical questions.

243
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:19,249
You might think that these things are obvious.

244
00:13:19,249 --> 00:13:21,240
But it happens all the time.

245
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:27,249
It's extremely common as a trans person to
have people you barely know casually asking

246
00:13:27,249 --> 00:13:28,949
you about what's in your pants.

247
00:13:28,949 --> 00:13:30,549
So, don't do that.

248
00:13:30,549 --> 00:13:33,610
It's not appropriate.

249
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:34,610
Health insurance.

250
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:39,970
So, don't wait until a trans person is interviewing
for a job at your company to find out if you

251
00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:42,859
have trans inclusive health insurance.

252
00:13:42,859 --> 00:13:44,749
You should find out today.

253
00:13:44,749 --> 00:13:48,490
Most insurance companies these days have like
a section in their literature specifically

254
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:52,480
about what is and what is not covered with
regards to trans health care.

255
00:13:52,480 --> 00:14:00,860
So, just take some time and familiarize yourself
with it so when they ask, you can answer.

256
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:02,149
Bathrooms come up a lot.

257
00:14:02,149 --> 00:14:05,029
You probably don't put a lot of thought into
them yourself.

258
00:14:05,029 --> 00:14:08,019
And for a lot of trans people, it's a minefield.

259
00:14:08,019 --> 00:14:15,240
And it's important that you know and understand
the extent to which we fret and worry and

260
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:20,769
stress out about them so that you can come
to it from a place of empathy.

261
00:14:20,769 --> 00:14:25,499
So, one of the reasons I love working remote,
personally, is I never have to worry about

262
00:14:25,499 --> 00:14:28,769
the drama of using a gendered office bathroom.

263
00:14:28,769 --> 00:14:33,119
In the best scenario, feeling an.

264
00:14:33,119 --> 00:14:42,059
Sometimes I waited until all the men left
and went to a meeting and then go to the men's

265
00:14:42,059 --> 00:14:43,059
room.

266
00:14:43,059 --> 00:14:45,160
Especially if I didn't know all of them.

267
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:51,420
Sometimes I even left an office to use a gender
neutral bathroom in a basement or a coffee

268
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:53,129
shop nearby.

269
00:14:53,129 --> 00:14:57,450
If I'm at an event like a conference or a
meetup if I don't know the bathroom situation

270
00:14:57,450 --> 00:15:04,339
beforehand, sometimes I will stop drinking
liquids hours ahead of time even if I'm thirsty

271
00:15:04,339 --> 00:15:10,019
or I won't eat even if I'm hungry to avoid
having to use the bathroom because I don't

272
00:15:10,019 --> 00:15:12,209
know what the deal is.

273
00:15:12,209 --> 00:15:16,009
Unless I know there's at least one gender
neutral restroom available.

274
00:15:16,009 --> 00:15:19,009
Then I'm not worried.

275
00:15:19,009 --> 00:15:24,629
So, what I'm saying is for some trans people,
not all of us, mind you, but definitely a

276
00:15:24,629 --> 00:15:27,970
lot of us, we put a lot more thought into
bathrooms than you might think.

277
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:32,449
So, what are some ways that you can deal with
this?

278
00:15:32,449 --> 00:15:36,559
The best case scenario is that you have single
stall gender neutral restrooms.

279
00:15:36,559 --> 00:15:40,529
This is the holy grail of the trans restroom
experience.

280
00:15:40,529 --> 00:15:46,189
It's the least anxiety inducing experience.

281
00:15:46,189 --> 00:15:49,399
Just degender gendered bathrooms.

282
00:15:49,399 --> 00:15:55,069
There's no reason for a single stall bathroom
with a door that closes to have a gender.

283
00:15:55,069 --> 00:16:01,610
And maybe you have bathrooms in several locations.

284
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:07,889
Is it possible that you could put signs up
on one and make that gender neutral?

285
00:16:07,889 --> 00:16:14,559
Sometimes events like this event we're at
together, sometimes they put up temporary

286
00:16:14,559 --> 00:16:18,779
signs over one set of bathroom to make them
gender neutral for that one event.

287
00:16:18,779 --> 00:16:24,699
So, if you do have gender neutral bathrooms,
but they're hard to find, that also happens

288
00:16:24,699 --> 00:16:25,699
a lot.

289
00:16:25,699 --> 00:16:29,750
I have called myself a truffle pig for gender
neutral restrooms.

290
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:34,069
I will find it.

291
00:16:34,069 --> 00:16:40,150
I've had people at conferences be like, where's
the\h brought you a map.

292
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:41,150
Yeah.

293
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:42,150
Put up signage.

294
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:43,589
This is helpful if it's somewhere else.

295
00:16:43,589 --> 00:16:51,589
Put signage by the gendered bathrooms so people
know where to find the gender neutral ones.

296
00:16:51,589 --> 00:16:57,040
It's worth a thought if you're hosting a company
event or an offsite that's a little more casual

297
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,410
like a small group.

298
00:16:58,410 --> 00:17:04,910
It would be great if they could do recon on
the bathroom situation in advance so that

299
00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:09,000
the trans people can know if there's, you
know, what's the situation?

300
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,210
Where I live in Portland, it's common, a lot
of bars and restaurants now have gender neutral

301
00:17:13,210 --> 00:17:14,630
restrooms.

302
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:19,380
But it's not like to when I go to company
offsite.

303
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:24,310
Anyway, this might be a little bit of an unusual
tip.

304
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:26,920
And also might be totally unnecessary depending
on your company.

305
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:33,900
But personally, if I'm in a situation where
I have to use gendered bathrooms, like in

306
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:40,950
a sports bar or someplace that's really like
just men.

307
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:47,030
I\h sometimes I like to have a bathroom buddy
who will go in first for me and will be like

308
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:49,380
there is, you know, this many stalls.

309
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:50,720
The stalls are full.

310
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,140
There's three urinals or whatever.

311
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:57,180
Tell me what's going on in there so that I
can know ahead of time.

312
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:58,180
Yeah.

313
00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:01,760
Occasionally I like my friend to go in with
me if it's really bad.

314
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,190
But that's pretty rare.

315
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:06,270
Year, I wrote this, already said it.

316
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:12,250
It come up in really masculine bars, sports
bars.

317
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:14,210
You don't have to do anything huge.

318
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:21,310
If you have a good friendship and they use
the same bathroom, it's worth privately at

319
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:25,790
these events, if you want someone to come
with you, I'll go with you.

320
00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:29,140
But not everyone wants this.

321
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:34,100
So, as I said, it depends on the kind of relationship
that you have with your co worker.

322
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:36,950
I've had friends do it for me and it's been
really helpful.

323
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:41,560
It really sucks to be out at a bar with your
coworkers and you feel like you have to leave

324
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:45,880
early or you have to miss out on things because
you don't want to use the bathroom there.

325
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:49,031
And sometimes depending on the event and who
is there, it can be like you're missing out

326
00:18:49,031 --> 00:18:51,600
on actually a really important networking
opportunity.

327
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:55,430
So, it's worth keeping in mind when planning
events or off sites.

328
00:18:55,430 --> 00:18:59,950
But again, it's like don't just approach any
co worker like this.

329
00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:03,270
Like you should know that you're really good
friends.

330
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:04,470
Otherwise it's really weird.

331
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:07,600
So, speaking of company off sites and events.

332
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:13,830
Sometimes you\h sometimes you might find yourself
traveling to and from an airport with a trans

333
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:14,830
co worker.

334
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:18,250
You probably know how terrible TSA is.

335
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:21,740
Like, have you heard?

336
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:27,440
But you might not be aware of like how awful
it can be for some trans people.

337
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:31,000
So, unfortunately there's not a whole lot
you can personally do.

338
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,820
But there's like ways you can be supportive.

339
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:37,900
So, you might not be aware of this, but the
scanners they put you through at the airport

340
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:43,160
require the operator on the other side to
decide over the course of about a second whether

341
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:45,150
to put you through as male or female.

342
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:50,350
So, the way the scanner scans your body for
bombs or whatever is that it sort of compares

343
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:54,760
your body to what it expects a male or a female
body to look like.

344
00:19:54,760 --> 00:20:00,700
So, for example, before I had surgery but
after I was on testosterone, I was stopped

345
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:04,600
and frisked every single time for chest abnormalities.

346
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:12,120
And I still sometimes get stopped and frisked
for groin abnormalities.

347
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:17,260
But I had to get into the habit of stepping
into the machine, this is a thing I did when

348
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:18,260
I had boobs.

349
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:20,750
I would step into the machine lean out and
say, hey!

350
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:24,480
I have boobs!

351
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,660
Hey!

352
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:31,750
Usually they would be like\h uh?

353
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:34,490
What do you want me to do about it?

354
00:20:34,490 --> 00:20:35,490
Just press the female button.

355
00:20:35,490 --> 00:20:37,920
Press the female button and then it would
be fine.

356
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:40,570
But, yeah, it's not for everybody.

357
00:20:40,570 --> 00:20:44,650
So, sometimes yeah.

358
00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:48,570
Literally depending on the mood of the TSA
agent and how trans phobic they are, it can

359
00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:54,170
go extremely poorly and result in a humiliating
experience if you're trans.

360
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:57,830
If you're in the cis person in the situation,
you don't have to do a lot.

361
00:20:57,830 --> 00:21:00,280
Make sure you're nearby in the security line.

362
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:04,430
Pay attention to how the TSA is treating your
co worker.

363
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:05,630
This is rare.

364
00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:09,520
But just be prepared to serve as a witness
if things go bad.

365
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:13,060
Consider having your phone ready to record
if something goes really bad and you have

366
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:14,060
proof.

367
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:21,250
if they are going to move them, step in and
say, hey, can I go with you?

368
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:24,760
Most of the time, it's just slightly awkward.

369
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:29,820
But things can and do go bad for trans people
moving through TSA.

370
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:34,740
It's important because this could happen to
a co worker or friend.

371
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:42,440
Being traumatized by TSA is a pretty bad start
to the work trip.

372
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:50,180
There was an article in The New York Times,
flying while trans that you can read.

373
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:55,740
It goes over a specific bad experience that
one person went through.

374
00:21:55,740 --> 00:22:00,390
So, one thing you might not have considered
is how much more trans friendly your workplace

375
00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:02,610
becomes when you let people work remote.

376
00:22:02,610 --> 00:22:06,350
Even if you have a primarily real life office,
if you let people work remote, as much or

377
00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:11,200
as little as they like without having to explain,
I'm working remote today.

378
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:18,080
You unintentionally solve a lot of problems
that trans people have in offices.

379
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:29,490
And some have days or weeks or months where
their dysphoria is really bad.

380
00:22:29,490 --> 00:22:33,500
It can be really debilitating if you have
it bad.

381
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:35,880
Sometimes it's easier to be remote.

382
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:39,960
You don't have to manage your dysphoria in
an office setting where there's triggers.

383
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:43,630
I don't get much anymore.

384
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:50,370
But when I wore a binder, the ways that my
clothes fit would be a huge trigger.

385
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:57,250
On one occasion I had a panic attack at an
event because of that and I had to go home.

386
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:58,250
Yeah.

387
00:22:58,250 --> 00:22:59,770
It just sucks.

388
00:22:59,770 --> 00:23:01,870
So, sometimes if\h when I used to wear a binder.

389
00:23:01,870 --> 00:23:04,360
It's really uncomfortable, restricts your
breathing.

390
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:06,360
Makes your chest hurt.

391
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:11,600
You're not supposed to wear it more than eight
hours if I had to go somewhere after work,

392
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:16,690
wear it for eight hours and go somewhere else
and be in incredible pain.

393
00:23:16,690 --> 00:23:18,520
You're not supposed to do that.

394
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:22,740
You can literally break a rib.

395
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:25,880
Yeah, working remote means that you don't
have to do that.

396
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:28,820
If you want to go to an event later, you don't
have to wear the binder all day.

397
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:31,700
That sort of thing.

398
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:34,590
So, struggs to func.

399
00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:42,860
It really goes for any marginalized group,
but you might not be aware, trans people's

400
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:44,440
rights are on the line constantly.

401
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:49,920
We have become a popular target of public
discussion in the news and a large variety

402
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:52,450
of other media.

403
00:23:52,450 --> 00:23:54,410
If you're trans, it's almost impossible to
ignore.

404
00:23:54,410 --> 00:23:58,090
And hard to deal with.

405
00:23:58,090 --> 00:24:01,830
Because I heard that the Supreme Court is
going to decide whether I should be protected

406
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:05,710
from discrimination in the workplace.

407
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:06,710
Great.

408
00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:09,410
Yeah, there's also the talk about rolling
back health care protections.

409
00:24:09,410 --> 00:24:10,570
Yeah.

410
00:24:10,570 --> 00:24:15,160
So, it's really stressful and terrifying and
it's hard to not let this kind of news affect

411
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:17,750
you when it has to do with your day to day
life.

412
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:20,580
Especially when sometimes it feels like nobody
even cares.

413
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:22,770
So, what can you do?

414
00:24:22,770 --> 00:24:27,620
I strongly recommend reading this blog post
by Lara Hogan from 2018 called Managering

415
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:34,550
in Terrible Times that makes a lot of good
suggestions.

416
00:24:34,550 --> 00:24:39,310
Personally I like seeing a show of public
support for coworkers.

417
00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:40,650
Seeing them Tweet support is great.

418
00:24:40,650 --> 00:24:44,610
At the last job, my boss put these trans flags
everywhere during pride.

419
00:24:44,610 --> 00:24:47,650
It was really cute.

420
00:24:47,650 --> 00:24:49,170
So, wonderful.

421
00:24:49,170 --> 00:24:53,890
In recent years, I've noticed a trend among
meetups and conferences and stuff that used

422
00:24:53,890 --> 00:24:57,960
to be for women in tech that are trying to
rename themselves to be more inclusive.

423
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:01,580
But unfortunately it often seems like they're
not really sure who they want to be inclusive

424
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:02,580
of.

425
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:05,650
They end up naming themselves women and non
binary or women and femmes.

426
00:25:05,650 --> 00:25:10,640
And nobody knows what it means.

427
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:13,400
Womxn.

428
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:21,320
This is a truly well meaning way of organizers
to be inclusive of women, but maybe not trans

429
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:22,320
men.

430
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:28,690
There's a lot of confusion about who they
want to be inclusive of, what the best wording

431
00:25:28,690 --> 00:25:31,700
is based on who they want to include.

432
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:33,300
If you're confused, I don't blame you.

433
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:35,190
It's confusing.

434
00:25:35,190 --> 00:25:40,060
So, let's see what we can do about this.

435
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:44,721
First of all, I'm gonna assume whatever event
we're going to be talking about, it probably

436
00:25:44,721 --> 00:25:49,050
started as something for women because women
are still an underrepresented gender in tech

437
00:25:49,050 --> 00:25:51,680
and they're still a marginalized group.

438
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:56,960
Many women experience misogyny and discrimination
in the workplace.

439
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:02,980
And many were raised to particular personality
traits, not rocking the boat, not speaking

440
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:08,150
up, and this is a male dominated field.

441
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:10,770
Most men were raised to be the opposite of
the traits.

442
00:26:10,770 --> 00:26:13,670
It can be exceptionally hard for women to
forge a path.

443
00:26:13,670 --> 00:26:20,130
It makes sense that groups have popped up
so women in tech can organize.

444
00:26:20,130 --> 00:26:25,940
In recent years women's spaces have, you know,
they've decided that they want to be more

445
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:29,320
inclusive of trans women, which is great.

446
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:32,730
As people have become more aware of the existence
of trans women and their collective need to

447
00:26:32,730 --> 00:26:40,540
be accepted in women's spaces, and become
aware of others, usually non binary.

448
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:46,100
Usually they become aware of non binary people
because someone in the group who formerly

449
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:48,370
was in the group comes out as non binary.

450
00:26:48,370 --> 00:26:54,050
And they don't to want exclude that person,
so they call themselves women and non binary.

451
00:26:54,050 --> 00:27:01,840
This causes issues because non binary means
a lot of things, and femme means way more

452
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,570
than people think it does.

453
00:27:03,570 --> 00:27:06,930
The messaging is confused.

454
00:27:06,930 --> 00:27:14,630
Non binary people are assigned male, there's
people like me who were assigned female and

455
00:27:14,630 --> 00:27:18,270
for lack of a better phrase now look like
men to most people.

456
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:20,200
Even though we're all non binary.

457
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:23,809
A lot of us wouldn't feel comfortable going
to the event, women and non binary, or women

458
00:27:23,809 --> 00:27:25,980
and femmes.

459
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:31,090
Not to mention trans men who are often ignored
or forgotten.

460
00:27:31,090 --> 00:27:37,850
They're still a large group who might have
experienced many or all of the situation or

461
00:27:37,850 --> 00:27:41,390
problems as women in tech and they're completely
excluded.

462
00:27:41,390 --> 00:27:43,370
So, what should you call it?

463
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:44,370
Yeah.

464
00:27:44,370 --> 00:27:48,483
I just want to get it out of the way that
it's absolutely fine and okay to have something

465
00:27:48,483 --> 00:27:49,500
that's just for women.

466
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:52,360
You're under no obligation to include other
genders.

467
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:59,860
And think about the mission, who you're including
and excluding and why.

468
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:04,880
I especially ask that you give serious consideration
to why you would exclude trans men because

469
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:07,740
you probably are.

470
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:10,800
Most but not all of the time these groups
and events with actually mean to include everyone

471
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,880
who is not a cis men.

472
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:20,281
Everyone assigned female at birth, male at
birth, non binary people, trans women, some

473
00:28:20,281 --> 00:28:22,540
intersex people.

474
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:26,340
If you have taken the time to thick the mission
of your group or event, think, I want to include

475
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:28,180
all genders.

476
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:36,300
Strongly encourage you changing the name and
mission and call it marginalized genders.

477
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:41,980
It avoids describing your group in opposition
to something that it's not and instead describes

478
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:42,980
who it is for.

479
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:47,820
You can put an asterisk next to the name and
be more descriptive or put not cis men in

480
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:48,820
the space.

481
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:51,910
Or be sure you're accurately naming your group.

482
00:28:51,910 --> 00:28:56,020
There's consulting you can hire to help out
with that.

483
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:57,320
I'm running out of time.

484
00:28:57,320 --> 00:29:06,610
But my last tip is not to like\h if someone
in your office is trans and you want to look

485
00:29:06,610 --> 00:29:09,010
something up on the Internet, like, don't
do that.

486
00:29:09,010 --> 00:29:12,370
Don't look them up on the Internet in front
of everybody because you can unwittingly show

487
00:29:12,370 --> 00:29:17,740
their birth name and all other information
that they would rather not show you unwittingly.

488
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:18,740
Anyway.

489
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:26,690
In closing, I want to reiterate that there
are things you should think about today.

490
00:29:26,690 --> 00:29:28,240
Don't wait, you know.

491
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,309
Do it now.

492
00:29:29,309 --> 00:29:33,010
I'm also happy to speak in more detail about
any of this stuff afterwards.

493
00:29:33,010 --> 00:29:37,320
So, feel free to come up to me or Tweet at
me or whatever.

494
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:41,510
There's a lot of things I didn't get to speak
in as much detail as I wanted.

495
00:29:41,510 --> 00:29:42,510
I'm happy to talk more.

496
00:29:42,510 --> 00:29:47,710
If you have a really complex concern, I will
refer you to someone who does that for a living.

497
00:29:47,710 --> 00:29:48,710
Not me.

498
00:29:48,710 --> 00:29:49,930
I'm just a regular person.

499
00:29:49,930 --> 00:29:52,950
But for most basic questions, I'm happy to
answer them.

500
00:29:52,950 --> 00:29:57,170
Finally, I feel bad that all of my Queer Eye
GIFs, Bobby has been underrepresented.

501
00:29:57,170 --> 00:30:02,110
here is one of the few Bobby GIFs I could
find.

502
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:04,431
Hopefully you can see why I wasn't able toll
find a place for it.

503
00:30:04,431 --> 00:30:05,431
That's it.

504
00:30:05,431 --> 00:30:06,431
I'm Julien.

505
00:30:06,431 --> 00:30:07,431
You should talk to me.

506
00:30:07,431 --> 00:30:08,431
Thank you.

507
00:30:08,431 --> 00:30:09,431
[ Applause ]
KATIE: Oh my gosh, thank you, Julien.

508
00:30:09,431 --> 00:30:10,431
I learned so much.

509
00:30:10,431 --> 00:30:11,431
I really appreciate you sharing your experience
with all of us.

510
00:30:11,431 --> 00:30:12,431
If anyone needs a good name for their formerly
women and non binary people group at work,

511
00:30:12,431 --> 00:30:13,431
at Etsy we've recently renamed to magic, which
is short for marginalized gender identity

512
00:30:13,431 --> 00:30:14,431
community.

513
00:30:14,431 --> 00:30:15,431
So, you are free to take Magic and use it
in your own company if you want to have a

514
00:30:15,431 --> 00:30:16,431
group that encompasses all genders.

515
00:30:16,431 --> 00:30:17,431
anyways.

516
00:30:17,431 --> 00:30:18,431
We're going to take a little break.

517
00:30:18,431 --> 00:30:19,431
Come back at 2:15.

518
00:30:19,431 --> 00:30:20,431
Sara Fecadu is going to be talking about how
music gets from your computer out into the

519
00:30:20,431 --> 00:30:21,431
speakers or something like that.

520
00:30:21,431 --> 00:30:22,431
Anyways, it's going to be really cool.

521
00:30:22,431 --> 00:30:23,431
I'll see you back here at 2:15.
