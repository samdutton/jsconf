1
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:13,730

I don't think it's right now I we look

2
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:16,099
pretty good now so I'm going to be

3
00:00:16,099 --> 00:00:18,470
talking about component libraries and

4
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:20,300
you might say what's the component

5
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:22,849
library which is what everyone at my

6
00:00:22,849 --> 00:00:25,250
company said when I said hey let's build

7
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:28,880
a component library so I try to make it

8
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,509
easier for them everyone had heard of

9
00:00:31,509 --> 00:00:35,780
bootstrap and so at work I started

10
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:39,040
working on something called boot stripe

11
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:43,160
it's pretty good you'll get it it'll

12
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:48,380
come to you uh so i encourage you to

13
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:51,680
build your own component library mainly

14
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,480
so you get to make your own something

15
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:57,410
strap j/s comp strap whatever you want

16
00:00:57,410 --> 00:00:59,329
to do stripes trap didn't work quite as

17
00:00:59,329 --> 00:01:01,700
well as boot stripe so that's what we

18
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:04,540
want with but oh why right one at all

19
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:07,250
you could just build your application

20
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:08,689
and then when you get to a button you

21
00:01:08,689 --> 00:01:10,640
style the button and then when you get

22
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,630
to a drop-down you style the drop-down

23
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:16,190
just like we've made web applications

24
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:19,549
for a really long time so I've prepared

25
00:01:19,549 --> 00:01:22,820
a list of facts that are definitely true

26
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:27,140
about CSS the first CSS fact is that

27
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:29,780
once you write a line of CSS it can

28
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:34,580
never be deleted it sounds like a myth

29
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:36,409
what if you think about your app you're

30
00:01:36,409 --> 00:01:38,090
always just a little too scared to

31
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:41,360
remove code and so you just add new

32
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:45,740
classes to go over those ones so i like

33
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:48,760
to call CSS an append only language

34
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:54,830
that's good you get code like this this

35
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:56,450
is my favorite I always see blocks like

36
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:57,710
this that you put this on a div it

37
00:01:57,710 --> 00:02:01,159
literally does nothing but you're like

38
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:03,770
well is it overriding the padding is

39
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:06,470
that I'm just gonna leave this here this

40
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:09,200
is fine I think it's not hurting anyone

41
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:14,379
so never remove it yeah so the fact 2is

42
00:02:14,379 --> 00:02:17,390
preprocessors are great as long as you

43
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:20,060
know exactly what the output this is my

44
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:24,709
favorite way of looking at nesting very

45
00:02:24,709 --> 00:02:28,130
common output for you gzip lovers this

46
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:31,340
is like a your best-case scenario though

47
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:34,400
so that's pretty great CSS fact three is

48
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,160
that no two people write CSS in a

49
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:41,390
similar way I feel like I work with some

50
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:43,040
of the smartest people in the universe

51
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,650
and this is probably about as best as I

52
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:49,310
could ask for literally every type of

53
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:51,410
casing and then some casings that don't

54
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:56,540
actually exist so yeah I'm sure you

55
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:59,090
recognize the naming schemes from your

56
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:01,780
own code and that's why you're laughing

57
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:05,510
so CSS fact for is you cannot test to

58
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:08,930
CSS it doesn't run in a way that you can

59
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:10,910
get stuff out there's not really good

60
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:14,660
joke for this once I'll move to CSS 5 so

61
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:16,430
you can't upgrade to a new version of

62
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:19,450
bootstrap without an animal sacrifice

63
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:22,879
and I decided not to include an image

64
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:27,140
for that one so deleting code and

65
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:30,410
testing actually go hand in hand the

66
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:32,239
easiest way to feel comfortable deleting

67
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:35,180
something is to make sure that you have

68
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:36,230
tests to make sure it doesn't break

69
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:38,540
something whenever you delete it so

70
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:41,150
component libraries are well tested and

71
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:43,909
highly reusable libraries for for UI

72
00:03:43,909 --> 00:03:48,530
components they would be ridiculous to

73
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:50,900
test if you did them inside of your

74
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:52,519
application so in a component library

75
00:03:52,519 --> 00:03:55,069
you're often testing that when you hover

76
00:03:55,069 --> 00:03:57,739
and it's active and the keyboard focuses

77
00:03:57,739 --> 00:04:00,500
on and you're looking sideways that the

78
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:03,590
the the thing comes around the edges of

79
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:05,510
the button correctly and if you did that

80
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:07,580
inside your application every time you

81
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:09,340
had a button that would be ridiculous

82
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:12,080
but luckily with a component library you

83
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,330
can kind of focus on those nice detailed

84
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:18,470
things and so the reason why this is

85
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:21,109
important is because this is me on a

86
00:04:21,109 --> 00:04:23,539
good day that's probably my best outfit

87
00:04:23,539 --> 00:04:25,129
I look really sharp I had a recent

88
00:04:25,129 --> 00:04:26,990
haircut I'm next to something involving

89
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:29,520
art

90
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:32,120
it looks like everything even matches my

91
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:34,070
clothes are on the right direction it's

92
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:37,010
pretty good day for me the code that i

93
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:38,270
read on this day is going to be

94
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:40,790
well-intentioned i'm clear thinking and

95
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:41,930
i'm going to do things for the right

96
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:47,990
reason this is me on a normal day was

97
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:49,400
about ninety percent of the time

98
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,700
ninety-nine percent of the time AV and

99
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:54,230
component libraries are all about making

100
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:56,300
sure that this version of yourself

101
00:04:56,300 --> 00:05:00,050
doesn't ruin the app for everybody so

102
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:01,610
use your best days to build up

103
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:03,890
components that you can use mindlessly

104
00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:07,490
on your worst days so you can do things

105
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:10,310
like keyboard accessibility I put in a

106
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:13,310
fancy thing Oh responsiveness there you

107
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:17,780
go oh I don't know actually how keynote

108
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:21,170
trans transitions work so forgive me

109
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:23,720
that was sweet focus states it's the

110
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,340
only way focus states can be interesting

111
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:29,750
as if they sparkle so active hover focus

112
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:31,070
like I talked about for and that's real

113
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:33,980
we really have styles that if you have

114
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:36,110
been using your keyboard and you're

115
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:38,510
pressing down and your mouse happens to

116
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:40,010
be over something like you can't have

117
00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:42,020
some weird stay that's a real estate and

118
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:44,660
you've never considered it before I hope

119
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:48,020
but I hope you do in the future because

120
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:52,190
of this stuff so it turns this this very

121
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:57,040
crappy but well-intentioned Mario clay

122
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:00,020
you know it's fully sculpted like there

123
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:01,430
was no instruction manual there's

124
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:03,650
nothing anyone can do to help you make

125
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:08,750
your perfect fairly flawed Mario and it

126
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:11,270
turns that into this which is you know

127
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:12,650
you have building blocks you have pieces

128
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:14,450
and you have instructions on how to put

129
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:16,760
it all together and so we do the same

130
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:19,810
thing for boot stripe we have this

131
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:22,010
documentation that looks beautiful on

132
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:24,890
this screen and we have what something

133
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:26,630
is we have how to use it we have

134
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:29,870
examples of it being used and that

135
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:31,820
really helps create consistency for

136
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:33,890
developers on how they integrate things

137
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:36,500
but also helps create consistency for

138
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,510
your end users every time that they

139
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:40,940
encounter a button every time they

140
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:42,720
encounter a nav menu

141
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,470
we're going to know what's going to work

142
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:49,170
the same way each time bonus everyone

143
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:52,080
has like the admin toolbar back-end

144
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,320
thing and it's really great that now

145
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,910
whenever we build these stupid crappy

146
00:06:56,910 --> 00:06:58,950
internal applications you can just use

147
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:00,570
your thing and it kind of looks like you

148
00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:03,870
tried it's just bonus so how can you

149
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:06,630
make a component library or more

150
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:08,700
specifically how can I make a component

151
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:11,880
library and it's going to be any better

152
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:15,030
than just using bootstrap out of the box

153
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:17,160
that's a good question you you probably

154
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,780
could use bootstrap for a lot of stuff

155
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:21,720
but bootstraps core competency is

156
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:24,180
generic pneus it wants to be the

157
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:26,730
baseline it has no styles on buttons and

158
00:07:26,730 --> 00:07:30,000
it's fairly accessible but everything

159
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,350
looks the same and people are pretty

160
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:33,660
tired of bootstrap websites by now if

161
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:36,210
you get in on bootstrap for early enough

162
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:37,740
maybe that'll be cool for like a month

163
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:40,140
or two so first thing you want to do is

164
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:43,650
choose a preprocessor not strictly

165
00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:45,510
necessary but really helps if you're

166
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:47,100
parsing CSS you can do a lot of the

167
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:48,150
testing things that we're going to talk

168
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:50,820
about that's ripe we didn't choose a

169
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:54,480
very normal one we wrote our own called

170
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:58,890
KFC SS uh you guys have KFC here either

171
00:07:58,890 --> 00:08:02,310
way s'okay of CSS is actually just a set

172
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:05,130
of modules on top of rework CSS so

173
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:07,140
mostly we're using open-source plugins

174
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:08,610
to do a lot of the things that you like

175
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:11,100
it be similar like miss if people use

176
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:16,169
myth it tries to model CSS for as

177
00:08:16,169 --> 00:08:17,760
closely as possible so this would be

178
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,740
really good for steps talk where you're

179
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:21,450
kind of more Polly filling the future

180
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:24,060
than you are kind of creating your own

181
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:27,060
magic we also kill things like extend so

182
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:28,470
we don't get crazy nesting and we just

183
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:31,550
deal with writing a class name twice

184
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:35,159
suit CSS is a good starting point we

185
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:37,110
don't use suit out of the box but we

186
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:39,390
kind of forked it and made it work for

187
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:41,550
our needs this is from necklace at out

188
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:43,950
of Twitter and this is really good for

189
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:47,250
creating encapsulated CSS components so

190
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:50,670
you can reason about your code in nice

191
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:52,740
little cool blocks that that you know

192
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,780
exactly what they're doing so here's the

193
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:56,020
example on

194
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:57,820
the naming conventions which is mostly

195
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:00,010
what sue CSS is as a set of naming

196
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:02,170
conventions and you can say this is a

197
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:04,300
component and people like their eyes

198
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:06,550
bleed whenever there's a capital class

199
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:08,470
name but you get used to I promise it's

200
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:10,600
kind of like when everyone tells you jsx

201
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,190
is so ugly and then they use it in there

202
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:15,190
like oh jsx is actually pretty cool this

203
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:16,540
is great because you can always tell

204
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:18,820
what is a component in your classes and

205
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:21,030
will and what isn't and then you have

206
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:23,230
structured ways of saying this is a

207
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:25,930
modification or this is a descendent or

208
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:29,620
this is something else and so you can

209
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:31,570
kind of get rid of this whole problem

210
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:35,860
that we had earlier you can add in your

211
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:37,450
own checks to your system and I'd

212
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:40,630
encourage you to add in checks into like

213
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:42,580
you can write rework plugins more or

214
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:44,080
less if you if you choose rework in

215
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:47,080
order to jump into your CSS and pick out

216
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,280
things that are important to your

217
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:51,790
organization one thing that bugged me at

218
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:55,840
work is a color checking so I wrote CSS

219
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:58,330
color guard have you seen that and CSS

220
00:09:58,330 --> 00:10:00,340
color guard is actually fairly useless

221
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:02,860
but I thought it was a cool idea and we

222
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:05,680
use it kind of at CI continuous

223
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,830
integration testing time but but to show

224
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:10,480
a good example here's gear most post

225
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,600
today from on Facebook about the road

226
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,940
Torres yesterday roadshows JavaScript

227
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:17,890
and let's say you wanted to know the

228
00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:21,130
color of those three buttons you could

229
00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:23,650
use dev tools but all of us have gone

230
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:26,080
through the real way that we would do

231
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,850
this which is to zoom into a million

232
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:33,610
percent I drop the darkest middle point

233
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:38,110
of the E and then it works every time

234
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:39,520
that's definitely going to be the

235
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:43,480
correct hex code so luckily there is an

236
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:45,430
algorithm that people in the television

237
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:48,970
industry created called cie de two

238
00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:50,890
thousand sounds like a robot which is

239
00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:55,690
also cool they they wrote this hella

240
00:10:55,690 --> 00:10:58,360
mathy formula for figuring out the

241
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:03,510
differences of of colors to humans so

242
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:05,500
something with a low score would be very

243
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,540
similar a zero would be the same color

244
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:10,029
and so like yellows are kind of

245
00:11:10,029 --> 00:11:12,079
harder to discern the differences

246
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:14,569
between then something like blue and so

247
00:11:14,569 --> 00:11:16,639
it's not actually just like compared to

248
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:18,170
hex values and so you can get this

249
00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:20,660
really fine grained way of saying how

250
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:23,449
similar these two colors and then you

251
00:11:23,449 --> 00:11:24,860
can yell at your co-workers

252
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:27,170
automatically and say like hey this blue

253
00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:30,319
is clearly should be Facebook blue and

254
00:11:30,319 --> 00:11:32,600
you're like two hex characters off how

255
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,920
about you just switch it to our style

256
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:39,259
guide color also you're fired we have a

257
00:11:39,259 --> 00:11:41,899
lot of api's at stripe we have a API for

258
00:11:41,899 --> 00:11:46,339
firing people so it's very simple oh the

259
00:11:46,339 --> 00:11:48,529
best part about writing CSS color guard

260
00:11:48,529 --> 00:11:51,259
let's go back to that page I'm going to

261
00:11:51,259 --> 00:11:56,230
run through all these again the CI ed

262
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:59,480
2000 algorithm this super Matthew one

263
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:02,209
that was an MPN module so I got all the

264
00:12:02,209 --> 00:12:04,160
credit and someone else has to do all

265
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:09,439
the math pro tip so here's an example of

266
00:12:09,439 --> 00:12:11,299
one of our test pages so you can test

267
00:12:11,299 --> 00:12:13,339
the SS as long as you're testing

268
00:12:13,339 --> 00:12:16,160
something very small well defined and

269
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:19,369
and relatively declaratively so this is

270
00:12:19,369 --> 00:12:23,629
two ways of marking up a switcher or

271
00:12:23,629 --> 00:12:25,220
toggle so you could kind of toggle

272
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:27,679
between those three things and we have a

273
00:12:27,679 --> 00:12:30,589
disabled State because there's that and

274
00:12:30,589 --> 00:12:32,329
we have an active state we're using the

275
00:12:32,329 --> 00:12:34,819
is active and is disabled which is from

276
00:12:34,819 --> 00:12:37,759
the suit CSS naming scheme you can kind

277
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:39,019
of see the three different ways that

278
00:12:39,019 --> 00:12:40,819
those look we're not clicking on

279
00:12:40,819 --> 00:12:43,249
anything we're not doing anything but we

280
00:12:43,249 --> 00:12:48,769
can run that through our CI server we

281
00:12:48,769 --> 00:12:50,329
can take a screenshot of it and we can

282
00:12:50,329 --> 00:12:51,860
make sure that it doesn't change unless

283
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:53,569
we wanted it to change so if you

284
00:12:53,569 --> 00:12:55,759
accidentally change the base blue color

285
00:12:55,759 --> 00:12:57,319
you accidentally change the margin

286
00:12:57,319 --> 00:12:59,389
around but buttons and some other file

287
00:12:59,389 --> 00:13:01,669
this file will throw an error we can go

288
00:13:01,669 --> 00:13:04,549
into that a little bit so I rework

289
00:13:04,549 --> 00:13:06,019
pseudo classes this is another example

290
00:13:06,019 --> 00:13:09,439
of why we chose to do KF CSS has small

291
00:13:09,439 --> 00:13:11,179
modules on top of kind of your

292
00:13:11,179 --> 00:13:13,489
preprocessor all this does is take

293
00:13:13,489 --> 00:13:15,709
things like the pseudo hover class and

294
00:13:15,709 --> 00:13:17,990
turn them into literally the word pseudo

295
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:21,559
dash hover so something like this some

296
00:13:21,559 --> 00:13:23,630
selector colon active turn

297
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:26,210
into the real selector as well as the

298
00:13:26,210 --> 00:13:28,610
declarative selector and then you can

299
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:30,080
actually add some things to your

300
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,820
declarative test pages so you can have

301
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:33,230
your button and then you can actually

302
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:35,390
add all your pseudo states and that way

303
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:37,310
you don't have to use a mouse to go in

304
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:39,110
and then drag over it and then try to

305
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:41,390
take a screenshot exactly as you click

306
00:13:41,390 --> 00:13:43,340
down with the fake Mouse and then pull

307
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:45,650
out and and it's never good especially

308
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:49,040
when you're dealing with you know sauce

309
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,960
labs or something that you don't even

310
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,820
have control over so that's never good

311
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:54,980
so you can do all this and then you

312
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:57,680
actually get a much bigger page with all

313
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,660
the different states and like I said

314
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:02,210
before there is the is active focus

315
00:14:02,210 --> 00:14:03,890
hovered state there and it looks

316
00:14:03,890 --> 00:14:05,180
different than the other states and it's

317
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:08,360
correct and good so we run this test

318
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:11,210
every time we make a commit and if

319
00:14:11,210 --> 00:14:13,490
anything changes say the margin around

320
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:15,710
the buttons we get this diff that says

321
00:14:15,710 --> 00:14:18,530
hey did you mean to do this and that'll

322
00:14:18,530 --> 00:14:20,360
actually fail to build if we want we can

323
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:23,150
commit a new image and say we intended

324
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:25,280
to do this and then you can actually see

325
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:27,950
the change that happens and this seems

326
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:29,120
like a cool video that I put together

327
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,850
this is actually just the onion skin

328
00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:35,540
Swiper from github so now we have a rule

329
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:37,370
that in order to make a change in boots

330
00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:39,710
stripe a designer must sign off on any

331
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:43,010
image changes so now every time anything

332
00:14:43,010 --> 00:14:44,960
visually changes in our entire library

333
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:47,510
it either fails a bill because it wasn't

334
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:50,000
supposed to happen or designer says this

335
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:55,070
looked correct and and it's okay so

336
00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:58,520
abstraction is key to some of the other

337
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:01,070
problems that we have the deleting code

338
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:02,560
is too hard with one of them and

339
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:05,480
changing opponent means that you have to

340
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,610
go find every single use in every app

341
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:09,800
that you ever use it in you may remember

342
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:12,770
trying to upgrade from bootstrap two to

343
00:15:12,770 --> 00:15:15,140
three people try to write whole scanners

344
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:16,940
of your app to go change the classes in

345
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:18,410
markup and all that kind of stuff and

346
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:21,230
that really stinks so one of the reasons

347
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:22,640
we can't delete code is because we don't

348
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:25,070
know who's using the past versions and

349
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:27,260
who's using the new versions and so we

350
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:31,280
can kind of pull out the writing of the

351
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,930
mark-up in the inclusion of the classes

352
00:15:32,930 --> 00:15:35,089
into its own abstracted library

353
00:15:35,089 --> 00:15:37,309
it's a lot of people are saying this is

354
00:15:37,309 --> 00:15:39,079
jae's comp you're talking about CSS an

355
00:15:39,079 --> 00:15:42,110
awful lot so this parts for you so you

356
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:44,540
can turn all your CSS components into

357
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:47,120
j/s application components so you can

358
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,999
pick your favorite poison they all have

359
00:15:49,999 --> 00:15:54,350
versions of of components that you can

360
00:15:54,350 --> 00:15:57,769
use we actually have libraries for react

361
00:15:57,769 --> 00:16:00,680
and ember at stripe there is a few

362
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:02,300
angular apps internally that I'm sure

363
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:04,779
will eventually get boot stripe angular

364
00:16:04,779 --> 00:16:08,779
versions so never use your component

365
00:16:08,779 --> 00:16:11,720
library directly which seems kind of

366
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,850
counterintuitive you never do this never

367
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:17,149
write a button with mark up with the

368
00:16:17,149 --> 00:16:19,370
classes that you use notice we actually

369
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:22,850
do have a boot stripe prefix on all of

370
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:24,350
those things that way you could actually

371
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:26,089
technically use multiple versions or

372
00:16:26,089 --> 00:16:27,379
anything like that that you wanted and

373
00:16:27,379 --> 00:16:30,740
it's helpful EBS is our is our prefix

374
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:32,480
and I really enjoy writing that each

375
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:36,230
time so the BS button and the is being

376
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:39,050
modified as a BS button large but we

377
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:40,670
don't want to write that we created

378
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:43,639
initially ember boot stripe and we

379
00:16:43,639 --> 00:16:46,490
created components just amber components

380
00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:48,230
and this is a BS button and it has a

381
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:50,300
size property and internally that

382
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:51,920
modifies the class names on a real

383
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,720
button tag but now there's a single

384
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:57,019
location that writes markup and adds

385
00:16:57,019 --> 00:16:59,779
these classes so if we realize that

386
00:16:59,779 --> 00:17:01,519
screen readers don't like the way that

387
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:02,929
we've marked up our button in two months

388
00:17:02,929 --> 00:17:05,089
we can go to a single location change

389
00:17:05,089 --> 00:17:07,309
the way it's marked up and it's done

390
00:17:07,309 --> 00:17:09,470
this actually happened with buttons did

391
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:12,380
you know with with the button class that

392
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:14,899
compiles to this but this actually is a

393
00:17:14,899 --> 00:17:16,370
submit button I didn't know that the

394
00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:19,789
default type of button was submit it's

395
00:17:19,789 --> 00:17:23,899
not button type button type button' is

396
00:17:23,899 --> 00:17:25,279
what you actually have to add to this so

397
00:17:25,279 --> 00:17:27,709
later we went in and added button type

398
00:17:27,709 --> 00:17:29,090
equals button and it no longer

399
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:31,100
accidentally submitted everything on

400
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:34,510
every page just great good side effect

401
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:37,399
so it also can automatically generate

402
00:17:37,399 --> 00:17:39,350
your style guide for you so a lot of

403
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:41,059
people talk about a living style guide

404
00:17:41,059 --> 00:17:46,520
and the common outcome is that you write

405
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:48,740
it once and then it's never updated

406
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:50,900
then no one ever visits it again and it

407
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:52,850
was a waste of two months and so you can

408
00:17:52,850 --> 00:17:55,340
actually use your components in order to

409
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:56,840
generate both the markup and the

410
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:58,910
examples you just integrate your

411
00:17:58,910 --> 00:18:00,470
components and any time you update your

412
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:02,510
application your style guide

413
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:04,670
automatically updates and so now you at

414
00:18:04,670 --> 00:18:07,160
least have some semblance of a living

415
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:09,200
dead style guide that's still no one

416
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,990
visits anyways but at least you know

417
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:14,840
that it's correct if you want to see

418
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:17,080
more information about good style guides

419
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:20,179
the Lonely Planet team has this great

420
00:18:20,179 --> 00:18:23,720
resource which is their style is called

421
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,790
a reso and I think it's fantastic they

422
00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:28,580
have all these different examples you

423
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:30,140
should check out Rizzo by the lonely

424
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:33,050
planet who does expect it so deleting

425
00:18:33,050 --> 00:18:34,940
code becomes a lot easier because we

426
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:36,679
have these small and cash elated file

427
00:18:36,679 --> 00:18:39,080
with files with good naming schemes and

428
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:41,090
we have good tests and so you can come

429
00:18:41,090 --> 00:18:42,500
in here and you can definitely say that

430
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,450
if I want to change the hover color

431
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:47,030
delete the hover color you know exactly

432
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:48,650
where to go in the file you know that

433
00:18:48,650 --> 00:18:49,910
you can delete it and then you can run

434
00:18:49,910 --> 00:18:53,450
the tests and know that only the change

435
00:18:53,450 --> 00:18:56,929
that I wanted to make was made you can

436
00:18:56,929 --> 00:18:59,240
also upgrade because now you're you're

437
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:04,580
never writing the the raw HTML you're

438
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:06,350
only writing your components and those

439
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:07,610
are encapsulated you can make the

440
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:09,530
changes you want and everything gets

441
00:19:09,530 --> 00:19:12,110
upgraded everywhere you can throw in a

442
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:14,570
grid we use flexbox grid because flexbox

443
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:17,630
is cool and all of a sudden you can make

444
00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:19,640
about ninety percent of your application

445
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:21,320
just by piecing together your you're

446
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:27,770
highly tested well-crafted what's good

447
00:19:27,770 --> 00:19:29,720
them I had a joke I couldn't think of it

448
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:32,840
you're you're you're well crafted CSS

449
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:35,090
components all together on a page and

450
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:37,100
then you can focus on that last little

451
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:39,080
sliver that makes your application great

452
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:40,790
and good you're never going to be able

453
00:19:40,790 --> 00:19:42,800
to just put together an application that

454
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,600
just immediately works and looks great

455
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,920
just because of your component library

456
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,960
but you can really really focus on the

457
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:49,610
on the things that makes each page

458
00:19:49,610 --> 00:19:51,400
different or each interaction different

459
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,960
that's all thank you oh this is a

460
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:56,900
snapshot that I screenshotted from

461
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:58,720
