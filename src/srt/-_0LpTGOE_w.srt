00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:24,150
[Applause]

3
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:29,240
and okay hello hi hello yes it's a year

4
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:31,730
today by the way guys didn't know hello

5
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:37,579
and 2014 is actually what I think a very

6
00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:40,250
good year to be doing web development

7
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:43,400
and me like what are you guys here

8
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,650
probably well probably all of you guys

9
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:48,040
pretty much do things in a browser and

10
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:53,089
and I think as a web developer I'm just

11
00:00:53,089 --> 00:00:55,160
gonna share with you guys I kind of feel

12
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:56,960
like our profession is a little taken

13
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,899
for granted around here and there's this

14
00:00:59,899 --> 00:01:01,969
pretty good studio that's pretty

15
00:01:01,969 --> 00:01:05,089
well-known Tehan and lex and this is

16
00:01:05,089 --> 00:01:08,920
their tagline it says if an atlas screen

17
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:12,740
we will design for it and it's it's a

18
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:16,070
very bold claim to make and it's

19
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:18,259
actually probably what every one of you

20
00:01:18,259 --> 00:01:21,229
guys do your day-to-day imagine that if

21
00:01:21,229 --> 00:01:23,300
it has a screen we will build her it

22
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:24,979
will design for it and that is what we

23
00:01:24,979 --> 00:01:28,070
do what I do and what you guys do every

24
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:29,780
day and I think that's some brilliant

25
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:34,040
thing and all of that is like what

26
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:37,280
happened after like decades of history

27
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:41,479
of web development so at some point in

28
00:01:41,479 --> 00:01:43,369
the past you know what development

29
00:01:43,369 --> 00:01:46,130
wasn't really much no one really thought

30
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:48,049
of it so much you know there's pretty

31
00:01:48,049 --> 00:01:49,369
much content with things that look like

32
00:01:49,369 --> 00:01:52,659
this but of course history happened and

33
00:01:52,659 --> 00:01:55,250
at some point people got together and

34
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:56,780
said like hey let's standardize this

35
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:58,820
thing called HTML and stop fighting over

36
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:01,070
what should be standards and let's just

37
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:03,079
mandate this is what should be going on

38
00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:05,630
moving forward and this was something

39
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:08,269
that was pretty hard to do over at that

40
00:02:08,269 --> 00:02:10,040
time if you could understand if you guys

41
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:12,079
are familiar with these kinds of things

42
00:02:12,079 --> 00:02:16,450
and that happened just last millennium

43
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:20,570
97 and fast-forward many many years a

44
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:23,090
couple of things happen until the

45
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:25,340
invention of something called I believe

46
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:28,640
it's called a smart phone yeah so that's

47
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:34,280
the smart phone yeah so okay might say

48
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,360
I'm a little unfair calling that

49
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,770
smartphone because there were other

50
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:40,980
smartphones before that but reality is

51
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:44,160
after that came out everything else just

52
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,290
kind of looked like that anyway so might

53
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:49,920
as well anyway a couple of a couple of

54
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,990
more years going along we have so many

55
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:54,300
ideas we have so many technologies

56
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:56,670
coming forward external five CSS and

57
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:58,920
eventually we came into this whole idea

58
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:02,700
of like hey maybe we could design for

59
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:05,550
any screen in the world which is the

60
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:06,870
same things that we have been using the

61
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:10,110
whole time then turns out the technology

62
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:12,120
to do that has been around for way too

63
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:15,390
long and media queries have been you

64
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:17,340
know it's been existing before anyone

65
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:19,020
ever thought of responsive design this

66
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:22,290
is an article from OS depart and that

67
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:25,170
was just 2010 and media crews were

68
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:28,500
already existing way back then so that

69
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,630
sort of thing just happened around 2010

70
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:33,030
and a couple of other things just came

71
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:35,790
up and we have so many things that we

72
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:39,150
could do on a browser on your computer

73
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:42,299
on your phone we can get someone from

74
00:03:42,299 --> 00:03:44,250
one point of the country to another and

75
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:47,040
tell them the exact directions right on

76
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,560
your browser and we could play videos

77
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:52,019
we've made text editors I think there's

78
00:03:52,019 --> 00:03:53,610
like two at least two out of know

79
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:55,730
there's probably even more than that

80
00:03:55,730 --> 00:03:59,780
text editors IDs made in just a browser

81
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:02,580
we've made games in a browser but I

82
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:07,110
think after all these developments over

83
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:09,000
the year searches this one Corino

84
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,360
problem that nobody has ever really

85
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:15,360
solved elegantly in the realm of

86
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,820
browsing and in the realm of web

87
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:19,739
development and I think that is vertical

88
00:04:19,739 --> 00:04:22,779
centering

89
00:04:22,789 --> 00:04:27,000
so that's it I'm Rico Santa Cruz you

90
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,069
might know me around some open source

91
00:04:29,069 --> 00:04:31,729
project as our star cruise and this is

92
00:04:31,729 --> 00:04:34,650
me talking about how to use flexbox to

93
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:39,210
save your sanity all right okay going

94
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:40,590
back to your vertical centering so I

95
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:44,009
went to the Internet like everyone does

96
00:04:44,009 --> 00:04:46,379
everyday looking for answers and it came

97
00:04:46,379 --> 00:04:49,139
across this and it's been asked five

98
00:04:49,139 --> 00:04:52,259
years ago and just like so many answers

99
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:54,779
those fourteen answers on this one and

100
00:04:54,779 --> 00:04:56,789
they had to lock the thread because

101
00:04:56,789 --> 00:05:00,900
people kept responding and I don't know

102
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,550
at some point I'm sure everyone has

103
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:03,960
thought of like how do you do vertical

104
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:08,159
centering and when I was like mute CCSS

105
00:05:08,159 --> 00:05:10,669
I mean when this whole CSS positioning

106
00:05:10,669 --> 00:05:13,289
thing was just really taking off I

107
00:05:13,289 --> 00:05:15,500
thought it was really easy you know I

108
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:20,099
thought it was just like this so that's

109
00:05:20,099 --> 00:05:21,689
my purse at temp and probably everyone

110
00:05:21,689 --> 00:05:24,599
else is too right and this is for those

111
00:05:24,599 --> 00:05:26,400
who haven't done that this is what it

112
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,529
looks like so obviously that's not

113
00:05:28,529 --> 00:05:32,639
really gonna work so you go back and see

114
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:34,409
like what did you do wrong maybe there's

115
00:05:34,409 --> 00:05:36,900
something you've missed maybe Center or

116
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:38,940
not middle and you go like oh I know

117
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:41,150
maybe you should use it to container and

118
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:43,199
after that this is what it looks like

119
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:47,069
and you go back and still don't really

120
00:05:47,069 --> 00:05:50,159
know maybe it's both and maybe it'll

121
00:05:50,159 --> 00:05:52,560
work and this is again what it looks

122
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:57,330
like so it's not really a solution so I

123
00:05:57,330 --> 00:06:00,000
went on the internet very recently and

124
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,839
looked like how do people solve this so

125
00:06:02,839 --> 00:06:05,099
if you guys want to do that right now go

126
00:06:05,099 --> 00:06:06,449
ahead but I've done the research for you

127
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:08,969
I'm just gonna show you okay if it's

128
00:06:08,969 --> 00:06:10,680
just one line you do a line height trick

129
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,750
wherein you set the same line height for

130
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:15,089
the same height if it's a fixed type you

131
00:06:15,089 --> 00:06:17,219
could do like a position:absolute top

132
00:06:17,219 --> 00:06:20,430
50% did I get it margin you could do

133
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:22,379
something like a table sell you can do

134
00:06:22,379 --> 00:06:25,080
fixed margin top you can do pretty much

135
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:28,320
I don't know there's like 10 odors and

136
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:30,900
ran out of space of the slide so there

137
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:34,350
are so many ways to do it anyway moving

138
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:35,190
forward there's this thing called

139
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:36,900
flexbox I'm not sure if you guys right a

140
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:39,330
bit I'm sure you guys have but I'm sure

141
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:40,800
not everyone has really used it because

142
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,780
you know everyone's kind of averse to

143
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:44,310
using it anyway it's really really

144
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:47,190
simple really simple actually there are

145
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:48,450
very long articles I was very

146
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:49,920
intimidated about it but it turns out

147
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:52,050
it's all really broken down to just two

148
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:54,480
basic things you just set something on

149
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,040
the container and set something on the

150
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,710
on the items something called display

151
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:01,890
flex and flex something so it's very

152
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:04,710
perfect for things like for for

153
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:07,890
basically app you eyes and you know

154
00:07:07,890 --> 00:07:09,450
these kinds of things that can tend to

155
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:11,370
pop up every now and then like sidebars

156
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:14,990
and menus and stuff like that and

157
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:18,060
there's a little quick yet to dispel a

158
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:21,600
couple of beauties flex lock is actually

159
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:24,840
pretty well supported right now so these

160
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:27,210
is these are the browsers that support

161
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:30,330
the new version of flex box there's

162
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:32,130
actually two versions of flex box the

163
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:33,900
old one and a new one this is the the

164
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:36,270
one with the support for the new ones if

165
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:37,950
you notice these are very recent

166
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:40,380
browsers and if you go back to the ones

167
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:43,920
that support the old syntax and it's

168
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:46,650
even actually way back whether it's

169
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:49,830
Firefox - I don't even remember that an

170
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:53,010
Android Eclair right and that's pretty

171
00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:57,030
much 2006 so we've actually had browsers

172
00:07:57,030 --> 00:07:59,730
that support flex bucks for a while now

173
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:04,940
the only stickler here is IE 10 so it's

174
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:07,350
it's not really good if you're targeting

175
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:09,090
IE but if you're making something that

176
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:12,600
targets mobile and ipads iphones that's

177
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,370
pretty good because you're probably not

178
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:17,280
really caring about that so much anyway

179
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:20,820
and if you use flexbox for things like

180
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:23,100
these these are pretty much what is

181
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:25,530
really made for you just really set like

182
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:28,650
a display flex on the container and you

183
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:32,280
set something called flex and the items

184
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:34,380
and that's pretty much what all we need

185
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:36,599
to do and there's just three magic

186
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:40,410
numbers and they mean these things

187
00:08:40,410 --> 00:08:42,030
basically

188
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:44,490
so all you really need to do is display

189
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:46,790
flex on a container and the item

190
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:50,760
something called flex property and it

191
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,920
just is really as three magic numbers

192
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:55,860
yes it looks it's emitting it's actually

193
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:58,530
pretty simple grow is usually like zero

194
00:08:58,530 --> 00:09:00,750
or one if it's what it means it's

195
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:03,000
flexible if it's zero it's not you can

196
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,440
actually use other numbers but more on

197
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:07,740
that later and shrink is what if it's

198
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:09,120
too small

199
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,310
am i is a browser allowed to shrink it

200
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:14,940
more than the basis so basis is like the

201
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:17,820
where's based out of you know what's

202
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:21,150
default with sort of and it's actually

203
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:23,880
pretty flexible not all three are

204
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,830
required sometimes you usually just

205
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:29,250
specify one or two so you guys can check

206
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:32,610
out I'm posting a link later so if you

207
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:35,790
won t cheated this out there so you

208
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:38,880
could just define which once you really

209
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,700
need and in the real world probably look

210
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:44,610
like this so if you do something like a

211
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:45,840
fixed type awhile ago

212
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:50,160
it looks like zero zero and whatever the

213
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,980
height is and if you want an extendable

214
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:55,650
it's just really Auto which is the same

215
00:09:55,650 --> 00:10:00,600
as one one auto and it's pretty much I

216
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,720
don't know I climbed to stop the server

217
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,950
now because it's really most of the

218
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:06,210
things you need to know but anyway let's

219
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:09,660
go on so if you want to space it out

220
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:12,690
something like this like evenly you can

221
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:16,290
actually put margins around around each

222
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:18,330
item and they would be honored by flex

223
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:20,250
bug that's just gonna work like how you

224
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:22,530
usually would expect if you know like

225
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:25,320
you probably use margin:0 auto at some

226
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,900
point and that thing just kind of works

227
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:31,740
for vertical as well and if we go back

228
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:35,130
to the problem of vertical centering

229
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:37,680
it's you're not gonna believe that this

230
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,500
works but it does so that's just really

231
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,690
it and it gets pretty clean centered

232
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:43,589
sure thing

233
00:10:43,589 --> 00:10:47,040
lovely so that's pretty much how you do

234
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,230
a vertical centering you just do a

235
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:52,080
margin on the item or the other way is

236
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:55,680
you can also modify

237
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,180
container instead of the item to have

238
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:59,370
more control this is a property called

239
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:01,920
justified content there's actually more

240
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:05,160
possible values for this but the ones

241
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,270
you're probably going to be using the

242
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:08,880
most is space around which means even at

243
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:12,180
the spacing vertically and there's

244
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:14,940
pretty much two of them justified

245
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:17,820
content is like vertical and a line

246
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:21,630
items is horizontal and that would also

247
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:24,029
get you a vertical Center and if you

248
00:11:24,029 --> 00:11:25,110
notice this one you're styling a

249
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:27,240
container and set it there instead of

250
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:30,089
the box instead of the item it's telling

251
00:11:30,089 --> 00:11:32,610
a parent instead and that would be

252
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:34,500
enough to get you to a vertical

253
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:38,550
centering just like that and essentially

254
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:41,610
thing about this is it's actually right

255
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:42,959
now it kind of looks like how you would

256
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:45,660
expect tables to work or something but

257
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:47,700
the really interesting things happen is

258
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:50,220
what if you combined that with media

259
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:52,740
queries so what could how could you make

260
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:54,660
something that would work as well on a

261
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:58,709
desktop and a tablet and a phone and the

262
00:11:58,709 --> 00:12:01,560
thing is since these are all just really

263
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:03,390
CSS properties and you could just

264
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:06,750
restyle them anytime you need to say put

265
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:09,420
a media query for a tablet and just want

266
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:11,520
to change the Flex direction from column

267
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:14,750
which is to make things vertical to row

268
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:18,000
you just it's just really one little

269
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,850
property right there and that's really

270
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:23,580
perfect for things like you know when

271
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:26,430
you're switching from tablet to mobile

272
00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:29,029
and another thing is you could even

273
00:12:29,029 --> 00:12:32,490
reorder things without changing the dump

274
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:35,010
order so you just go through that icon

275
00:12:35,010 --> 00:12:37,470
just went from right to left and you

276
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:39,779
just really have to change order this

277
00:12:39,779 --> 00:12:42,329
little CSS property called order and you

278
00:12:42,329 --> 00:12:44,190
could just set an order for any one of

279
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:45,570
those property if any one of those

280
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:47,310
elements and you can just reorder them

281
00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:50,640
depending on your media query so if you

282
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:52,500
put all these things together and you

283
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:53,910
just put a little media courier right

284
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:59,040
here and basically it says that whenever

285
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,860
you're on a we're on a phone you're

286
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:03,600
going to make it vertical and you're

287
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,760
going to reorder the a bike

288
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:09,030
so in reap and practice this is what

289
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:13,710
it's probably going to look like and

290
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:16,380
that's it you were able to make a menu

291
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:19,380
with very very little modifications to

292
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:23,730
your CSS and uh if anyone wants to

293
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:26,790
follow along this this example is

294
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:30,630
actually posted over at github and old

295
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:33,350
flat sheet paper URL later on and

296
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:37,020
basically this entire thing is built out

297
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:40,410
of flex box just really every just like

298
00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:43,680
all the macro layout is all made out of

299
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,660
flex box and the fantastic thing is it's

300
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:49,080
you could also nest your flex boxes so

301
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:52,320
you can have like three elements for

302
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,480
your main columns their main panes and

303
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,240
that's just your regular flex box kind

304
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:00,630
of properties so this one is on 20% 80%

305
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:02,610
of the other puts like min and Max with

306
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:04,380
just to make sure it doesn't collapse

307
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:07,410
too far and that's pretty much it you're

308
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:10,080
going to have like perfect columns on a

309
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:12,930
desktop but please by the way right if

310
00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:14,490
anyone wants to follow along I tweeted

311
00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:15,900
the link you can just check out my

312
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:20,990
twitter and link is over there and and

313
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:33,190
so this is what it looks like play okay

314
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,389
so basically just do the same kinds of

315
00:14:35,389 --> 00:14:39,230
things wherein you take the take this

316
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:41,389
kinds of flexbox kind of properties and

317
00:14:41,389 --> 00:14:42,829
put a little media elements and just

318
00:14:42,829 --> 00:14:44,510
change the orientation from horizontal

319
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:47,300
to vertical and you just get a really

320
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:55,760
nice responsive almost effortlessly so

321
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,709
again it's just really all nested

322
00:14:57,709 --> 00:15:00,050
flexbox so this is how it probably would

323
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:02,149
look like under your typical app where

324
00:15:02,149 --> 00:15:04,070
you have like a horizontal kind of setup

325
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:06,980
and it would flatten out to a vertical

326
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:09,880
one whence you shrink your browser and

327
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:12,529
as you notice like you could just hide

328
00:15:12,529 --> 00:15:14,329
one of the panes whenever you are in a

329
00:15:14,329 --> 00:15:16,519
mobile just display knowing or some

330
00:15:16,519 --> 00:15:18,740
things and that would be fine and just

331
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:21,500
nest flex spots within a flex box

332
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:24,410
so even the things inside the delisting

333
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:26,510
is a flex bucks and a flex bucks

334
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:29,300
so the menu you saw that a while ago

335
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:32,720
though and that listing is actually

336
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,329
pretty simple just like that and then

337
00:15:35,329 --> 00:15:36,529
the pastor would probably do something

338
00:15:36,529 --> 00:15:38,060
like this in like position absolute

339
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:40,760
position fixed with like top left bottom

340
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:43,010
right and fixed pixels but now at least

341
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:45,079
there's something more flexible and and

342
00:15:45,079 --> 00:15:47,000
the thing is you can the wonderful thing

343
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,250
here is if you want to add like say a

344
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:51,890
search bar or something just right under

345
00:15:51,890 --> 00:15:53,870
it it's pretty easy just insert another

346
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:56,089
dumb element and put like another flex

347
00:15:56,089 --> 00:15:58,430
thing over there and that's it you could

348
00:15:58,430 --> 00:16:00,500
you can pretty much change your eye up

349
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:05,390
any time you want and if you notice this

350
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:07,850
is actually it turns out to be something

351
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:10,279
that could actually work and here it is

352
00:16:10,279 --> 00:16:13,010
like I don't know like 40 additional

353
00:16:13,010 --> 00:16:15,680
lines of JavaScript so you make it kind

354
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,839
of do its thing and that's it we

355
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:22,240
actually we're able to make a pure CSS

356
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:25,069
approach to this whole responsive deal

357
00:16:25,069 --> 00:16:28,310
and there's no fancy JavaScript to like

358
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:30,500
what happens when you size it down you

359
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,329
need to hide this and that just pretty

360
00:16:32,329 --> 00:16:35,480
much that and all that was able to be

361
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:37,010
accomplished with Flex box by the way

362
00:16:37,010 --> 00:16:40,880
right here here is the Twitter and you

363
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,319
can just check out the link over there

364
00:16:42,319 --> 00:16:45,540
if you want to look at the source so

365
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:48,389
trying to say is right now what temp cui

366
00:16:48,389 --> 00:16:51,420
layout problems it's pretty much solved

367
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:53,009
when it comes to something that would be

368
00:16:53,009 --> 00:16:56,100
on mobile and it's something that really

369
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:58,410
makes you lets you integrate things

370
00:16:58,410 --> 00:17:01,410
really really fast because if you really

371
00:17:01,410 --> 00:17:03,269
want to rearrange things or just want to

372
00:17:03,269 --> 00:17:06,030
add and subtract and add you panels new

373
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:08,669
layouts you just really have to just add

374
00:17:08,669 --> 00:17:11,339
another element and flex buckles take

375
00:17:11,339 --> 00:17:13,079
care of trying to lay that out for you

376
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:16,709
and if you try to go through like you

377
00:17:16,709 --> 00:17:19,709
know different websites out there a

378
00:17:19,709 --> 00:17:22,079
couple of them can be solved but flexbox

379
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:24,780
really so they're a couple of there's a

380
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:27,660
lot of scene in the properties he could

381
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:30,090
also use for flex bucks it like say for

382
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:32,520
example align cell flex and is something

383
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:33,929
you would probably use a set of

384
00:17:33,929 --> 00:17:37,679
float:right which while it goes pretty

385
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:40,440
much said that floats are evil so flex

386
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:42,440
logs is another way to get around it and

387
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:46,169
if you go to like content area it's

388
00:17:46,169 --> 00:17:47,790
pretty much the same kind of deal and

389
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:50,330
you can even use a shorter flex box

390
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:53,730
syntax just flex 5 and flex 3 so

391
00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:55,470
basically if you just specified the

392
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:57,960
growth parameter it's kind of trying to

393
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,940
figure out which one's bigger and which

394
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:02,159
one smaller and you know based on each

395
00:18:02,159 --> 00:18:06,150
one's relative growth parameter and yeah

396
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:09,900
say this one - could be salt it's pretty

397
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:12,990
much everything is just really a grit

398
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:15,690
everything is just a something that can

399
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:17,490
be solved with nested layouts and

400
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:19,200
fantastic thing is if you if you're able

401
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,840
to do it if you could implement like a

402
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,179
layout like slack over something like

403
00:18:24,179 --> 00:18:26,220
this it can be responsive down to tablet

404
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:29,280
so imagine like you could just say hide

405
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:34,350
the sidebar or no go to your under

406
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:36,450
sidebars to make sure that it could also

407
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:39,480
work in its head what so most of them

408
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,640
for the most part it's something that is

409
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:44,760
pretty much solved right now and if you

410
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:47,970
go to can I use comm the only thing that

411
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:50,040
really is slowing down the adoption of

412
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,179
flex bucks right now

413
00:18:51,179 --> 00:18:54,659
is ie because the minimum thing the

414
00:18:54,659 --> 00:18:56,850
minimum version that really supports

415
00:18:56,850 --> 00:18:58,560
flex bucks for real as I

416
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:02,780
ie 11 so but as far as like the mobile

417
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:06,030
mobile adaptation even some of the older

418
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:07,650
iPhones older androids are able to

419
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:09,930
support it so it's something that is

420
00:19:09,930 --> 00:19:11,490
actually pretty usable when it comes to

421
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:12,360
mobiles

422
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:14,820
so and if you're gonna do something like

423
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,770
mobile do I suggest you give it a try

424
00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:21,840
and that's it for me so that's me Rico

425
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:26,320
and that was the lunch on flexbox
