1
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:37,149

okay yeah I so I have a bit of a cough

2
00:00:37,149 --> 00:00:38,590
so I'm going to try to like get through

3
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:42,790
this as painlessly as possible so yeah

4
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:44,530
the name of the presentation is called

5
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:48,219
burn the museum's pretty good I work at

6
00:00:48,219 --> 00:00:50,230
a company called Twitter I wore a shirt

7
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:52,510
so if you're not familiar there's like

8
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:55,690
the deferred stuff it's pretty cool you

9
00:00:55,690 --> 00:00:57,460
should check it out it's in a city

10
00:00:57,460 --> 00:01:00,879
called San Francisco and when I'm not

11
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:04,059
working and I actually at work too I all

12
00:01:04,059 --> 00:01:06,100
I really do is I write libraries that's

13
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:08,440
all I've somehow convinced Twitter to

14
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:11,170
allow me to do that for like a job I

15
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:13,720
work on this library at work called

16
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:16,300
widgets j/s which does like tweet button

17
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:18,580
and follow button and tweet and beds and

18
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:21,729
like all that crazy and then I also

19
00:01:21,729 --> 00:01:24,100
do a lot of open source libraries which

20
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:28,149
is what Alex was talking about so one

21
00:01:28,149 --> 00:01:29,710
library is called bootstrap which you

22
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:31,420
might have heard of its kind of it's

23
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:35,409
kind of a big deal on github right now I

24
00:01:35,409 --> 00:01:37,479
also work on another one which is that

25
00:01:37,479 --> 00:01:41,200
Oh bootstrap is like a UI kind of thing

26
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,869
and then ender is another thing that I

27
00:01:43,869 --> 00:01:47,409
work on and ender is like a package

28
00:01:47,409 --> 00:01:49,600
manager it's like an attempt at a

29
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:50,710
client-side package management

30
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:53,259
piggybacks on NPM I saw Isaac actually

31
00:01:53,259 --> 00:01:55,000
at some point at this confident I don't

32
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,140
know he's probably not here he's like

33
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:58,000
Jacob who's that loser I'm not going to

34
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,740
that dock and the the other library were

35
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:06,549
gone is called Hogan jazz with the very

36
00:02:06,549 --> 00:02:09,039
brilliant rob sager just like all the

37
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:11,079
really cool stuff and I just kind of

38
00:02:11,079 --> 00:02:13,900
like just pretend like I help out

39
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:19,150
sometimes and so when I got first asked

40
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:21,670
to like talk here I was like really

41
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:23,140
confident I was like I'll to talk about

42
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:25,329
bootstraps gonna be awesome so easy I

43
00:02:25,329 --> 00:02:27,010
talk about all the time people say hey

44
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:30,910
you're the bootstrap guy like yeah and

45
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:33,489
then after we had to sing it Twitter

46
00:02:33,489 --> 00:02:35,920
called tea time and after one of the tee

47
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,500
times dan webb was like who works at

48
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,540
Twitter it's like it's pretty cool he

49
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:41,680
came up to me he's like oh here you

50
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,180
might talk to Jess confidence

51
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:45,609
he's like it's Jay it's like it's

52
00:02:45,609 --> 00:02:47,349
 Jas comp you can't talk about

53
00:02:47,349 --> 00:02:49,000
Jas comp you can't talk about
bootstrap like you have to talk about

54
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,159
something cool and like weird like talk

55
00:02:51,159 --> 00:02:53,650
about bacon or like do something unique

56
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:56,500
and I was like oh like I do nothing

57
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,030
except for right libraries like I have

58
00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:00,400
my lights last slide but I used to read

59
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,430
books sometimes so it I was like hey

60
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:04,930
that's all I got I'll talk about books

61
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:08,230
kind of but the books that I read when I

62
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:09,639
like went back to look at the books I

63
00:03:09,639 --> 00:03:11,290
read they're like the worst books like

64
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:14,650
everyone hates these books and so at

65
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:18,220
school I studied futurism and data which

66
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:20,019
are like Eastern Central European

67
00:03:20,019 --> 00:03:22,480
avant-garde books which are just the

68
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,370
most frustrating books to read or

69
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:26,620
encounter average just like people

70
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:29,129
writing things to be annoying kind of

71
00:03:29,129 --> 00:03:32,590
and I often times I feel my I find

72
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:34,780
myself doing similar things so if you've

73
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:36,370
seen like bootstrap I don't add

74
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:38,049
semi-colons and it's really just to

75
00:03:38,049 --> 00:03:41,799
annoy you but I'm going to talk a little

76
00:03:41,799 --> 00:03:46,269
bit about these guys these are Italian

77
00:03:46,269 --> 00:03:47,889
features they look really cool I was

78
00:03:47,889 --> 00:03:49,239
really excited when I found this picture

79
00:03:49,239 --> 00:03:52,239
I was like look at these guys so so cool

80
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:53,889
I could really just end the presentation

81
00:03:53,889 --> 00:03:56,099
with these guys would be like man

82
00:03:56,099 --> 00:04:00,310
successful successful Jays go best one

83
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:03,129
of it and so these are futurists were

84
00:04:03,129 --> 00:04:04,689
crazy and they're really about one thing

85
00:04:04,689 --> 00:04:07,720
which was eliminating the past doing

86
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:10,120
cool new stuff and I would talk to you

87
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:13,269
about that a little bit so to kind of

88
00:04:13,269 --> 00:04:15,099
like set the stage it was early if early

89
00:04:15,099 --> 00:04:17,680
20th century there's like telephones and

90
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,810
automobiles and airplanes and all this

91
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:21,250
new stuff and they were like freaking

92
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:22,870
out because you have artists who were

93
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:24,520
kind of unstable to begin with and then

94
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,979
like all just crazy cool new stuffs

95
00:04:26,979 --> 00:04:28,570
happening and they're like oh my god

96
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:30,150
they're like losing their and so

97
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:34,120
look at there we go so there's this guy

98
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:37,360
Marin Eddie who's a poet and he he ends

99
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,800
up writing this feature is manifesto

100
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,599
where he talks about speed he actually

101
00:04:40,599 --> 00:04:43,060
has this one poem where he like she was

102
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:44,320
freaking out through the whole thing

103
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,970
he's actually starts he's talking about

104
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:48,639
riding in a car at like 40 miles an hour

105
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:50,860
and how it's like the fastest anyone's

106
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:52,029
ever gone and how it's like so

107
00:04:52,029 --> 00:04:54,010
incredible which now seems so dumb

108
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:54,770
because like

109
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:56,270
40 miles oh you're like stressing out

110
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:57,910
when the speed limit is 40 miles now now

111
00:04:57,910 --> 00:04:59,930
but they were like freaking out because

112
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:01,370
they'd been on like horses in lame

113
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:05,300
like that and so and so here's a piece

114
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:07,310
of art from them and you can kind of see

115
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:08,569
like they're getting really excited

116
00:05:08,569 --> 00:05:10,970
about like motion and bright colors and

117
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:13,340
this is called rise of the city and so

118
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:14,780
you have all this and these artists are

119
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:16,009
all freaking out and having a good time

120
00:05:16,009 --> 00:05:19,220
and just about the same time there's

121
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:21,830
these anarchists like so there's like

122
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:23,479
Marx it's like a whole thing don't have

123
00:05:23,479 --> 00:05:27,349
you've heard of marks and so these

124
00:05:27,349 --> 00:05:29,750
Italian anarchist show up and they've

125
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:31,280
got bombs and they're freaking out there

126
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,169
so excited they're like oh my god the

127
00:05:33,169 --> 00:05:35,419
future it's good it's so good we got to

128
00:05:35,419 --> 00:05:37,130
destroy everything that's the past and

129
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:39,409
amidst this wild ecstasy of destruction

130
00:05:39,409 --> 00:05:41,780
let man reborn is Java ba-ba-boom future

131
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:44,150
it's got to be great and unfortunately

132
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:46,159
this thing happens which is the world

133
00:05:46,159 --> 00:05:48,319
war one and as you can imagine all these

134
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:50,240
Italian people that are like these crazy

135
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,770
artists are like yes the war that'll

136
00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:54,169
clear everything out so soon as Italy

137
00:05:54,169 --> 00:05:55,909
joins the war like all the future sir

138
00:05:55,909 --> 00:05:59,690
like yeah war and they all like join but

139
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:01,130
they're artists so they suck at fighting

140
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:06,199
and they all die like this just movement

141
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:10,940
over like it's just done which is which

142
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:12,710
is kind of sad because they were come to

143
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:14,990
some cool stuff but luckily there's this

144
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:16,580
thing called data which is the other

145
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:19,580
stuff that I read which is it's awful um

146
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:21,110
is this these guys you can tell so

147
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:23,560
they're they're pretty great see clearly

148
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:26,000
which is you know it's good it's funny

149
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,550
sometimes um so during World War one

150
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:30,110
there was this neutral area in

151
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:32,990
Switzerland called Zurich and all the

152
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:34,400
kind of the artists that were like wait

153
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,289
turns out i'm pretty sure i'm going to

154
00:06:36,289 --> 00:06:38,029
die if I got in the war I'll just go

155
00:06:38,029 --> 00:06:39,529
chill out here and it turned into kind

156
00:06:39,529 --> 00:06:44,550
of like a South by Southwest for artists

157
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,360
when I I had this like weird I went to

158
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,710
South by Southwest for the first time

159
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:50,510
this year and when I first got there I

160
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:52,310
was just like walking down the street

161
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:54,110
and I saw Alex Sexton like blackout

162
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:56,360
drunk just like walking I was like holy

163
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:59,810
is that Alex Sexton like oh my god so

164
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:01,310
I'm imagine it must have been the exact

165
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:03,020
same they were like oh my god I'll execs

166
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:05,840
then I freaked out it's a lot like

167
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,930
and so but the thing is all these

168
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:10,010
artists are here but they're not

169
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:12,080
relieved they're not like yeah I escaped

170
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,270
them like the war like hey good times

171
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:16,010
like you are at South by Southwest

172
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:17,660
they're like they're super pissed

173
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:19,280
they're like man I had this awesome flat

174
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,020
I was hauling at the sweet honey and

175
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:23,510
Paris it was great now I'm in the Zurich

176
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:27,410
like come on this sucks and so there are

177
00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:29,510
all these really frustrated artists and

178
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:31,010
they have all this pent-up energy and

179
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:32,630
like they need an outlet and a place to

180
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:34,970
come together and there's this one guy

181
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:36,830
named Hugo Bob could I want to talk

182
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:40,400
about a lot um and he is that a pub and

183
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,750
he's having a drink with the faces like

184
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:45,050
mates or whatever and he's like this is

185
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:47,150
a guy kind of nice like nice place is

186
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:49,280
super empty it's probably like half the

187
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,710
size of this and he's like why is there

188
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:53,210
no one here the sex and the bartender's

189
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:55,520
like being really sad and emo because no

190
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,530
one's drinking at his buyer and he's

191
00:07:57,530 --> 00:07:58,730
like a bartender don't worry I've got

192
00:07:58,730 --> 00:08:01,040
some friends they'll calm one time a

193
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,450
night just one time neither artist

194
00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:05,060
little weird no big deal but i bet i'll

195
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:06,050
make you a lot of money and you'll stay

196
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:09,050
in business um so littell does the

197
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:12,070
bartender no Hugo ball is crazy

198
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:16,420
he is just he is out of control crazy

199
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:19,100
and so this is him he's about to give he

200
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:21,860
gives his sound poems I'm which I turn

201
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:23,510
out to be really incredible and everyone

202
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:26,600
forget excuse me freaks out but he's a

203
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:29,960
little nuts um and later on he says this

204
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,730
this thing which like moved me in this

205
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:33,410
really crazy way and I want to talk

206
00:08:33,410 --> 00:08:34,580
about for the rest of the time that I'm

207
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:36,500
allowed to talk to you guys which is we

208
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:37,880
should burn all the libraries and allow

209
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,380
to remain only that which and everyone

210
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:43,430
knows by heart and and the first time I

211
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:45,350
read that I was like yeah that sounds

212
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:48,320
awesome and then I was like I write

213
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,100
libraries actually

214
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:53,220
and actually that's kind of like all I

215
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:58,680
do so I just kind of sad as a weird

216
00:08:58,680 --> 00:08:59,850
moment so I was like why do you why

217
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:01,500
would you say that like you sing like a

218
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,829
cool guys got that like cool costume on

219
00:09:03,829 --> 00:09:09,089
it's probably pretty regular and so the

220
00:09:09,089 --> 00:09:10,290
first thing i did like every good

221
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:11,550
english majors i went straight to

222
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:15,000
wikipedia and i said what like what's a

223
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,190
library like i wanted to know kind of

224
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:19,019
the history and libraries if you've ever

225
00:09:19,019 --> 00:09:20,430
looked at the history of libraries are

226
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:25,100
so boring oh my god but luckily

227
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:27,449
wikipedia summed it up pretty easily or

228
00:09:27,449 --> 00:09:29,069
like pretty simply as this which is why

229
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:31,019
Barry's mark the end of prehistory in

230
00:09:31,019 --> 00:09:32,430
the start of history so if you think of

231
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:34,139
them as kind of like when we start

232
00:09:34,139 --> 00:09:36,180
writing down stuff like Oh historians

233
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:37,860
can study that then we might collect it

234
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:39,120
it's like whole thing and I'm like okay

235
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,190
it makes sense this is just like a

236
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:43,889
future thing he's like futurism is like

237
00:09:43,889 --> 00:09:46,199
the same time maybe but they were all

238
00:09:46,199 --> 00:09:47,699
like they had the bombs they were just

239
00:09:47,699 --> 00:09:49,529
trying to get rid of it but then I knew

240
00:09:49,529 --> 00:09:50,819
that wasn't really true i was like lying

241
00:09:50,819 --> 00:09:52,050
to myself totally owe something that my

242
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:55,920
dad so i was like well i can't i can't

243
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,449
look into libraries anymore because

244
00:09:57,449 --> 00:09:59,069
they're boring as as i just said

245
00:09:59,069 --> 00:10:01,380
and so what if I think about programming

246
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:02,550
libraries which are like the bee's knees

247
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:04,560
we all will use libraries they're

248
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,420
awesome they have to be cool cuz we work

249
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:10,230
on him so what's the history of

250
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:12,329
programming libraries back to Wikipedia

251
00:10:12,329 --> 00:10:14,850
every everything I try to find on the

252
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:16,170
history of libraries just kept coming

253
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:19,079
back to this one book which ironically I

254
00:10:19,079 --> 00:10:22,680
had to go to a real library to find even

255
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,779
though I tried so hard not to I was like

256
00:10:24,779 --> 00:10:27,990
oh my god a library so bad I went there

257
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:29,730
and the worst part was i couldn't check

258
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:32,250
the book out i had to be there so to get

259
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:35,160
multiple trips to the library saddest of

260
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:38,430
times for me um but the book is really

261
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:40,649
interesting and it's actually not like a

262
00:10:40,649 --> 00:10:42,120
book in the traditional sense it's

263
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,769
actually just kind of like it was a

264
00:10:43,769 --> 00:10:45,540
conference that they had and they have

265
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:47,189
all these like crazy old people that I

266
00:10:47,189 --> 00:10:48,120
had never heard of because I know

267
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:50,100
nothing about computer science talking

268
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:51,630
about computers and like how things are

269
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:54,540
going on and then there's this woman who

270
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:56,730
turns out she's a boss she does

271
00:10:56,730 --> 00:11:01,230
like she's very important and you should

272
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:02,339
know who she is and

273
00:11:02,339 --> 00:11:04,470
she's a Grace Hopper and I was like oh

274
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:07,259
my god this she's like she's like his

275
00:11:07,259 --> 00:11:08,790
Navy woman she's knows all about

276
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:10,439
libraries this this whole thing it's

277
00:11:10,439 --> 00:11:13,740
really crazy oh my gosh and so I'm

278
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:16,589
reading through her like a like her

279
00:11:16,589 --> 00:11:18,930
conference talk thing I hope someday

280
00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:20,490
there's a book made about this talk so

281
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:22,350
someone's just like so depressed reading

282
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:26,160
through it so the first instance of a

283
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,170
library that I'm going to say is is this

284
00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:29,519
line right here which is I'd whistle a

285
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:31,199
dick and say can I have your sign

286
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:32,699
subroutine and I'd copied out of his

287
00:11:32,699 --> 00:11:35,040
notebook the first time I read that I

288
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,129
was like holy the first library it

289
00:11:38,129 --> 00:11:41,790
was Dick's notebook oh my gosh and she

290
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:43,680
doesn't even say your dick is and so it

291
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,290
just so mysterious and so cool I was

292
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:48,629
like yes why would even would burn that

293
00:11:48,629 --> 00:11:52,410
it's so awesome Dick's notebook and so

294
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:53,759
this turned out to be about nineteen

295
00:11:53,759 --> 00:11:58,050
forty four ish and that's that's crazy

296
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:00,089
that's a long time ago bo a lot there's

297
00:12:00,089 --> 00:12:02,910
a quote it's cool and and as time goes

298
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:04,050
on they're like collecting these things

299
00:12:04,050 --> 00:12:05,879
together dicks notebooks getting huge

300
00:12:05,879 --> 00:12:07,589
and like there's coffee stains and it

301
00:12:07,589 --> 00:12:10,439
looks really serious meanwhile in London

302
00:12:10,439 --> 00:12:13,470
there's these guys these london bros who

303
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:15,929
are like oh yeah this is obviously this

304
00:12:15,929 --> 00:12:17,999
is pretty failed dicks notebook and they

305
00:12:17,999 --> 00:12:20,160
kind of design like a new like a like a

306
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:23,429
library that we would think of but

307
00:12:23,429 --> 00:12:25,559
unfortunately there's no computer that

308
00:12:25,559 --> 00:12:27,149
can like run their library so this write

309
00:12:27,149 --> 00:12:28,139
a paper and they're like we've had two

310
00:12:28,139 --> 00:12:30,209
libraries but it doesn't it didn't even

311
00:12:30,209 --> 00:12:32,370
work it's not really a thing meanwhile

312
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:35,990
Grace Hopper the boss is like like I

313
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:38,459
this like she's she's running in all

314
00:12:38,459 --> 00:12:40,199
these problems like people are writing

315
00:12:40,199 --> 00:12:42,179
B's it's turning into the 13s Forza

316
00:12:42,179 --> 00:12:44,459
turning into A's and eventually she like

317
00:12:44,459 --> 00:12:46,800
writes the first compiler and it's crazy

318
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,350
and it's blew my mind and so basically

319
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:51,779
all with all that like means is that

320
00:12:51,779 --> 00:12:55,139
after Hugo ball was like we should burn

321
00:12:55,139 --> 00:12:57,420
all libraries half-century later we have

322
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:59,610
this whole new thing this whole new

323
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:01,920
library idea which is programming

324
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:05,429
libraries which is in ticks notebook

325
00:13:05,429 --> 00:13:08,220
which is pretty cool and then about 50

326
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:09,749
years later them all this whole time

327
00:13:09,749 --> 00:13:11,459
we've been like using more and more

328
00:13:11,459 --> 00:13:13,350
libraries I actually looked into how

329
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:15,120
long jquery has been around because i

330
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:15,900
was just kind of I like

331
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:19,020
I like I don't know like like some time

332
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:21,660
turns out there's a history jquery

333
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:24,570
something very cool very useful in like

334
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:27,030
two thousand six well i think in 2005

335
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:28,890
john rzeznik was like but i might be

336
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:32,370
working on a library and then like a

337
00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:36,390
year later he was like jquery boosh and

338
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:39,090
everyone like lost their shadows good um

339
00:13:39,090 --> 00:13:40,730
so if you think about that that's like

340
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:43,200
like six years only really the jake

341
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,370
where's been around we've had libraries

342
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:47,490
for 50 years like what if we really just

343
00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:49,680
started over like how crazy would that

344
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,560
be if you think about six years like how

345
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,050
far jquery's come from like John Rezac

346
00:13:55,050 --> 00:13:56,460
just being like I wait you guys I'm

347
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:57,750
working on something pretty cool too

348
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:59,730
like oh my god everyone knows what

349
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:01,440
jQuery is it's like a household name in

350
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:07,200
like nerd households and and so so I

351
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,820
said in the beginning I work at a

352
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:10,440
Twitter and I have a lot of freedom

353
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,510
because like people don't really take me

354
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:15,120
seriously and they're like okay Jacob

355
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,470
you can like interview people sometimes

356
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:18,930
oh wow thank you and so what I started

357
00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:21,180
doing was I'd walk in with like a smug

358
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:23,430
smile on my face and I have a marker and

359
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:24,960
I'd be like you have 45 minutes to write

360
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,760
jquery from scratch it as far as you can

361
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,530
so from whatever you like it's gonna be

362
00:14:28,530 --> 00:14:30,960
great you're gonna love it um I tweeted

363
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,100
this out because I thought this was

364
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:33,240
awesome and that everyone should be

365
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:35,820
interviewing like this and Ray bango was

366
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:37,680
pretty quick to point out that I was

367
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:40,350
like losing it like you're evil no one

368
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:42,750
can do that it's awful and basically all

369
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:44,270
the internet agreed with him except for

370
00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:47,610
Rick Waldron who was like yes he's like

371
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:49,380
like not only is that an awesome

372
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:51,480
question I'm going to just do it for fun

373
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:54,600
just because I want to see so props to

374
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,010
him I think it's cuz he's metal and has

375
00:14:56,010 --> 00:14:59,040
a cool jacket if you see him looking at

376
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,690
jackets got like reflectors is the whole

377
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:04,980
thing is really cool so basically well

378
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:06,300
that what I got from that was

379
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:08,370
instinctual you'd say if we burned all

380
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:10,710
libraries we'd be screwed we would be

381
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:12,360
like oh my gosh we have no idea what's

382
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:15,030
going on we're totally screwed after

383
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:17,370
asking this question a few times the

384
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:19,110
whiteboards will also suggest we are

385
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:20,089
screwed

386
00:15:20,089 --> 00:15:23,779
um people have no idea what's going on

387
00:15:23,779 --> 00:15:26,540
like you say you know okay well like

388
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:28,430
there's a dollar take some things and

389
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:30,499
like gives you some stuff no one knows

390
00:15:30,499 --> 00:15:32,689
what's going on is it's black box come

391
00:15:32,689 --> 00:15:36,379
on Jake away good thing but what if we

392
00:15:36,379 --> 00:15:37,970
just tried it like what if we just are

393
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:40,490
egomaniacs and we're like oh man like

394
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:41,990
jQuery it's a thing it's pretty good

395
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:43,939
this works perfectly I'm just going to

396
00:15:43,939 --> 00:15:46,490
rewrite it whoo guys so I so I tied I

397
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:49,249
tried that actually with this guy named

398
00:15:49,249 --> 00:15:51,620
Dustin d is we were like jQuery is

399
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:53,120
pretty awesome it does everything we

400
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,769
want we don't really have any major

401
00:15:54,769 --> 00:15:57,079
complaints but what if we just started

402
00:15:57,079 --> 00:15:59,269
rewriting like what we kind of knew by

403
00:15:59,269 --> 00:16:02,209
heart and so we tried that and so that's

404
00:16:02,209 --> 00:16:05,360
like a selector engine a events library

405
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:10,069
in the Dom utility and so the first

406
00:16:10,069 --> 00:16:11,809
thing we kind of noticed was like the

407
00:16:11,809 --> 00:16:13,579
things were smaller this was like during

408
00:16:13,579 --> 00:16:17,420
the micro j/s like buzzword time and it

409
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:19,430
was good and so things were smaller

410
00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:21,170
there's like more focus api's we're like

411
00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:23,839
we're awesome we are like we're saving

412
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:25,249
the internet we're the best people ever

413
00:16:25,249 --> 00:16:28,850
um which is always you should when you

414
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:31,519
feel like that you should say huh maybe

415
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:35,720
I'm missing something um and so horse

416
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:38,059
ebooks if you don't know who horse

417
00:16:38,059 --> 00:16:40,490
ebooks is it's really like the Oracle

418
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:43,670
and Twitter and one time horse ebooks

419
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:46,610
tweeted Dalton dangerous at all times

420
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:49,160
and usually wholly unnecessary and I

421
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:51,980
read that and I was like oh my god horse

422
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:53,949
ebooks knows about John David Dalton oh

423
00:16:53,949 --> 00:16:58,639
my god because literally the very like I

424
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:00,949
was feeling like about this I was like

425
00:17:00,949 --> 00:17:03,199
as my swag was on max I was like I'm the

426
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:05,059
best JavaScript person ever I just

427
00:17:05,059 --> 00:17:07,399
rewrote jquery its way smaller John

428
00:17:07,399 --> 00:17:09,649
Dalton turns out popped up was like dad

429
00:17:09,649 --> 00:17:11,870
is you you're wrong everywhere

430
00:17:11,870 --> 00:17:13,909
everything is wrong there's so many bugs

431
00:17:13,909 --> 00:17:16,579
because dalton has this really

432
00:17:16,579 --> 00:17:18,669
profoundly interesting way of

433
00:17:18,669 --> 00:17:21,169
approaching library developers and that

434
00:17:21,169 --> 00:17:23,839
he points out something which is really

435
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:25,630
valid like your thing doesn't work in

436
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:29,120
Opera some old opera that no one uses in

437
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:31,159
this weird use case that's totally valid

438
00:17:31,159 --> 00:17:34,390
and then posts like a really

439
00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:36,590
frustrating animated gift which trolls

440
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:37,850
the out of you makes me feel like

441
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:41,779
an asshole and so the first like 15 or

442
00:17:41,779 --> 00:17:44,149
so issues that he opens you're like this

443
00:17:44,149 --> 00:17:46,580
guy ah you just close them you're like

444
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:48,169
block and what github I think they added

445
00:17:48,169 --> 00:17:52,159
that feature for Dalton and but then

446
00:17:52,159 --> 00:17:54,200
like as soon as you kind of cool down

447
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:56,990
and you're like okay like and you like

448
00:17:56,990 --> 00:17:59,510
read the post there all he's right it's

449
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:01,460
just makes the gifts he hurt even more

450
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:07,429
and what it turns out is that starting

451
00:18:07,429 --> 00:18:10,279
over is so hard it's so hard and a lot

452
00:18:10,279 --> 00:18:12,230
of the value from things like jQuery no

453
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:14,330
libraries is that they're old which is

454
00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:15,950
sad because I'm usually like hot old

455
00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:18,350
people even though after coming up after

456
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:20,840
James and who's 19 now I feel like I'm

457
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:23,799
like a dinosaur appears stressing me out

458
00:18:23,799 --> 00:18:26,600
it's just really hard but it's really

459
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:29,059
hard when you starting over from only

460
00:18:29,059 --> 00:18:30,320
that which you know by heart because

461
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,210
everyone only kind of notes like that

462
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:34,279
special thing by heart right like they

463
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:35,779
have that really intimate relationship

464
00:18:35,779 --> 00:18:38,090
with like something weird and there's

465
00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:39,980
something like Dalton happens to know

466
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:41,570
like these really crazy things which is

467
00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:44,929
great but it makes it really hard and so

468
00:18:44,929 --> 00:18:47,510
is there a path forward I mean Dalton

469
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:49,070
can't comment on everything like you

470
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:51,049
can't be there to point out like hey

471
00:18:51,049 --> 00:18:53,360
this will work like dude screwing up

472
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:56,870
natives or something and and I think

473
00:18:56,870 --> 00:18:59,330
there is there's these things called

474
00:18:59,330 --> 00:19:01,690
tests that you might have heard of

475
00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:04,940
they're pretty useful it turns out crazy

476
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:08,659
right and so the second kind of

477
00:19:08,659 --> 00:19:12,020
attempted just totally starting over was

478
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:14,840
this library that Rob's air and I worked

479
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:16,970
on which is called a ho Kang Jas if

480
00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:19,210
you're familiar with it Hogan Jas is

481
00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:22,909
essentially a of mustache and JavaScript

482
00:19:22,909 --> 00:19:26,659
so when we said that when we first

483
00:19:26,659 --> 00:19:28,580
released that people were like oh cool

484
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:30,649
story bro there's already mustache yes

485
00:19:30,649 --> 00:19:33,950
it does the same thing like what are you

486
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:38,270
doing um and we're like no no listen

487
00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:40,510
listen listen that's really good hold on

488
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:42,649
and I get some I skip a beat well

489
00:19:42,649 --> 00:19:44,300
basically it's good because it's just

490
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:48,290
way better in every way and so what

491
00:19:48,290 --> 00:19:50,090
mustache really enabled us to do was

492
00:19:50,090 --> 00:19:51,850
they had this interesting model where

493
00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:54,230
mustache templating instead of it being

494
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:56,480
like this is our like librarian it's

495
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,730
this implementation they open so they

496
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:00,560
have like a special project in there

497
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:03,350
like whole world which is the specs

498
00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:05,600
directory which has all their specs laid

499
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,190
out in JSON and yamel so it makes it

500
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:08,600
really easy for different languages to

501
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,220
implement them and you have to implement

502
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:12,350
like and get all these tests passing in

503
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:14,390
order to be considered like running the

504
00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:20,380
mustache like spec in like 4 10 and so

505
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:22,880
what that enabled for us to do was to

506
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,890
say okay like the reason why we

507
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:27,050
initially wanted to rewrite it I'm

508
00:20:27,050 --> 00:20:28,700
assessed yes is because it was really

509
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:31,130
slow for us and particularly in ie7

510
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:32,450
because they were doing all the

511
00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:34,760
compiling and all the parsing and

512
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:36,290
everything on the fly in JavaScript we

513
00:20:36,290 --> 00:20:37,700
were like this is wrong like why would

514
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:39,470
you do it here like a precompiled doy

515
00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:41,990
and like plus like let's speed up

516
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:43,730
everything and so we did that we wrote

517
00:20:43,730 --> 00:20:46,790
Hogan which at exactly what mustache did

518
00:20:46,790 --> 00:20:49,160
it was totally different we improved the

519
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:51,410
performance by like I just a stupid

520
00:20:51,410 --> 00:20:53,390
amount like an embarrassingly a huge

521
00:20:53,390 --> 00:20:55,070
amount the library size of small

522
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:57,020
everything was better there's the day we

523
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:58,400
released Hogan like if you didn't switch

524
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:01,190
over right away like come on like why

525
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:02,450
are you what are you waiting for it was

526
00:21:02,450 --> 00:21:11,020
crazy and sorry there's some Spanish um

527
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:15,020
so oh my gosh totally lost method also

528
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:17,410
go to the next slide okay yeah so

529
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:20,420
basically what happens is we release

530
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:22,480
this thing it's really great and

531
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:25,310
mustache says oh most yes chance we

532
00:21:25,310 --> 00:21:26,870
actually have someone who works on the

533
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:28,400
mustache jayus library this guy named

534
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,440
Michael Jackson at Twitter who's totally

535
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:33,680
awesome and he was like oh my god yeah

536
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,270
this is like just as all this things is

537
00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:37,130
different and so mustache like changes

538
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:38,330
and they evolve and they had pre

539
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:39,710
compiling and they do a bunch of other

540
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:41,540
really cool stuff and now we have this

541
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:43,760
like really health healthy like

542
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,890
evolution of implementation towards a

543
00:21:45,890 --> 00:21:47,930
common spec and we have this competition

544
00:21:47,930 --> 00:21:50,000
around a common spec and so all of a

545
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,970
sudden like things for like comply users

546
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:55,670
like you guys just got so much better so

547
00:21:55,670 --> 00:21:57,360
fast and it was amazing

548
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:00,330
and then like we like hugged it out and

549
00:22:00,330 --> 00:22:01,950
things were really good and we're like

550
00:22:01,950 --> 00:22:03,809
really happy there's like little hearts

551
00:22:03,809 --> 00:22:09,490
and stuff so good so good girl and what

552
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:15,270
afterwards ok this is this will be all

553
00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:22,440
right come hug time Oh time thank you

554
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:28,320
thank you hugs so good oh my god that

555
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,590
was like a football style hug all right

556
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:34,770
um oh my gosh I can't believe that

557
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:39,120
happened is good though Wow room

558
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,740
three-twelve if you want to continue

559
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:47,549
that later so so we got this awesome

560
00:22:47,549 --> 00:22:48,960
thing we have these tests passing

561
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,429
mustache makes it really easy because

562
00:22:50,429 --> 00:22:52,650
you can just like there's this test

563
00:22:52,650 --> 00:22:54,780
suite and it's just awesome and we

564
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:55,980
didn't want to like just give a pull

565
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:57,179
request to you guys which was like

566
00:22:57,179 --> 00:22:58,470
delete your library here's your new

567
00:22:58,470 --> 00:23:01,410
library no because no one really wants

568
00:23:01,410 --> 00:23:03,179
to see that like we've seen this nodejs

569
00:23:03,179 --> 00:23:05,100
trolls to CoffeeScript and it didn't

570
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:06,720
turn out good like I don't want the like

571
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,730
so we had to release our libraries the

572
00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:09,929
whole thing because people asked us that

573
00:23:09,929 --> 00:23:11,100
often like why didn't you pull requests

574
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:12,660
like okay delete your library replace

575
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:16,350
applies kind of awkward um and so now

576
00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:18,990
what yeah why would Hugo say that why

577
00:23:18,990 --> 00:23:22,679
would he say you know like wanted to say

578
00:23:22,679 --> 00:23:25,770
that um and I think after I thought

579
00:23:25,770 --> 00:23:27,090
about this for a long time it's just

580
00:23:27,090 --> 00:23:28,860
because things get better and I just let

581
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:30,750
that you get hugs which is great and

582
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:32,549
things just get better for everyone if

583
00:23:32,549 --> 00:23:36,840
we like do this sort of stuff and so my

584
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:38,429
questions that I wanted to kind of end

585
00:23:38,429 --> 00:23:41,190
this whole talk thing on we're really

586
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:43,559
why are we sharing all our tests like

587
00:23:43,559 --> 00:23:45,270
why aren't we doing this thing that

588
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:46,950
mustache is doing more often like why

589
00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:49,230
why isn't this a thing like why don't we

590
00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:50,549
see this everywhere why don't we see

591
00:23:50,549 --> 00:23:52,919
people coming together around spec in

592
00:23:52,919 --> 00:23:56,370
order to implement a library um so like

593
00:23:56,370 --> 00:23:57,960
common things that you would expect to

594
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,549
see this sort of thing in would be like

595
00:23:59,549 --> 00:24:01,380
selector engines or dom utilities or

596
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:04,140
less for example my friend Alexi he's

597
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:05,910
like so tired of maintaining less he

598
00:24:05,910 --> 00:24:07,440
recently added some other contributors

599
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,840
but I was like dude just why don't you

600
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,010
just write unit tests

601
00:24:11,010 --> 00:24:12,390
be like whoever's you want like

602
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:15,480
implement this why isn't there like a

603
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:17,370
common thing for events xhr like all

604
00:24:17,370 --> 00:24:18,600
these things that we use all the time

605
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:21,240
they're kind of is something that I kind

606
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:22,530
of soft for selector engines that was

607
00:24:22,530 --> 00:24:25,590
called like slick shootout but then

608
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:27,690
there was like all this flame war around

609
00:24:27,690 --> 00:24:30,780
it there's just not and it you want to

610
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:34,830
come up here tom okay sorry I heard him

611
00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:36,570
Charlie this is not allowed come on um

612
00:24:36,570 --> 00:24:40,530
oh it's just calling slick speed yeah

613
00:24:40,530 --> 00:24:42,420
yeah and so like I mean once looks me

614
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:43,740
came out I was like oh yeah this looks

615
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:45,930
like about right John Resig was like all

616
00:24:45,930 --> 00:24:47,760
know this is like totally F like you're

617
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,110
doing all these things wrong and valerio

618
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:50,220
and then that you know they have their

619
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:53,340
back and forth and so but basically out

620
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:55,830
I guess I'm wondering what if going

621
00:24:55,830 --> 00:24:57,930
forward we define a library not so much

622
00:24:57,930 --> 00:24:59,520
by its implementation but by its test

623
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:02,880
suite and and then a bigger ramification

624
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:05,850
of this kind of is like what happens if

625
00:25:05,850 --> 00:25:07,800
we burn da library burned all libraries

626
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:10,800
without test Suites and like how amazing

627
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,210
that would be because I actually

628
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:14,280
originally had a slide which had called

629
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:15,930
out a bunch of like libraries with over

630
00:25:15,930 --> 00:25:17,460
a thousand Watchers that were JavaScript

631
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:21,210
that had 0 unit tests which is sadly a

632
00:25:21,210 --> 00:25:23,310
huge amount so if you're in this room

633
00:25:23,310 --> 00:25:25,380
and you're like oh yeah I run this thing

634
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:27,120
it's awesome people love it use it every

635
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,700
day but units it's not my jam turns out

636
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:31,740
super important you should write them

637
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:33,630
real like right now I don't even go to

638
00:25:33,630 --> 00:25:36,950
the next talk probably gonna be horrible

639
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:39,780
chest up no I'm kidding it's gonna be so

640
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:40,860
much better than the stock they're gonna

641
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:44,430
dig that's it just go just write unit

642
00:25:44,430 --> 00:25:47,610
tests oh my god and so that's basically

643
00:25:47,610 --> 00:25:49,140
it actually I was going to edit this

644
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:50,580
slide and I forgot so I want to do it on

645
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:56,700
the fly and so what that's basically the

646
00:25:56,700 --> 00:26:04,030
morals sorry uh let me stay here fake

647
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:06,450
um but yeah that's basically that's all

648
00:26:06,450 --> 00:26:09,290
I really had to say was like oh that's

649
00:26:09,290 --> 00:26:12,690
Brenda larousse follow fake Angus yeah
