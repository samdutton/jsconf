00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:11,759

hey everyone so my talk is called

2
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:14,910
JavaScript 2 Enterprise Edition I'm

3
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:18,050
gonna come back to that title later on

4
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:20,250
first of all about me

5
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:23,039
I work as in Estrada which are those

6
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:29,250
people here I do work on metal object

7
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:31,399
system for JavaScript called Jews and

8
00:00:31,399 --> 00:00:36,800
I'm blogging at non-blocking from IO and

9
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:40,170
inspired for this nice IKEA so far I'm

10
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:44,579
on twitter as creme force so first of

11
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:47,039
all we're now I said I was going to

12
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:48,960
speak at jazz Kampf my employer asked me

13
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,930
say a few nice words about sinister art

14
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:55,530
so you all want to work there so we come

15
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:57,840
to that blah blah blah blah but I have

16
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:01,620
some important facts there's currently

17
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:04,280
one service ijs project in production

18
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:07,680
there's two active CouchDB projects

19
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,530
running there's one service i JS project

20
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:13,290
and development there's two earthling

21
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:15,150
projects and planning and there's ten

22
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:19,890
million dollars in the bank so that's so

23
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:23,939
much for since Roger copy today is j2ee

24
00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:28,140
and why is it j2ee some people called

25
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:29,880
jews j2e

26
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:33,630
and i'm gonna talk about why there could

27
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:38,130
be that kind of misconception when i

28
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:39,900
have a quote from John Mayer who was

29
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:42,180
talking this morning and said Marvel and

30
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:44,130
the Jews for always pushing the

31
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:46,079
boundaries on managing JavaScript to

32
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:51,360
their women so but up this small picture

33
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:58,579
here that's what we do like you know

34
00:01:58,579 --> 00:02:02,730
embracing and extending the language and

35
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:05,400
what you end up in the end is something

36
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:08,490
like this like you know when you look at

37
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:11,060
this picture you know that's working

38
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:15,060
because there's no complexity of course

39
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:18,120
so ya j2e

40
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:21,750
I I don't suppose everybody hates me no

41
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:26,610
but I still had to put these up here so

42
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:29,000
so so let's start over

43
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,550
what is Jews Jews is a metal object

44
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:34,650
system for JavaScript

45
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:39,510
so of course question is why meta and

46
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:44,600
there's a simple answer in this picture

47
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:48,900
strange loops of fun so I don't know who

48
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:51,330
here read grid I shall pass by Douglas

49
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:57,030
Hofstadter I'm actually not done yet but

50
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:57,990
I'm working on it

51
00:02:57,990 --> 00:03:02,220
about one page per week and there's nice

52
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:05,640
pictures in that book so what's the

53
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:08,760
magic object system fun thing about is

54
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:11,030
this questions like does the metaclass

55
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:14,100
have a meta class and the meta cares of

56
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:15,720
the metaclass automatic list of the

57
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:18,800
metaclass does it have a metal clasp and

58
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:23,130
then there's things like juice is

59
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:27,230
written in itself so who wrote itself

60
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:30,000
and there's really simple answer

61
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,100
actually it's JavaScript object little

62
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:35,190
holds for the win which I call loop

63
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:37,739
unrolling for objects so of course we

64
00:03:37,739 --> 00:03:39,480
can't you can't really write something

65
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,010
in itself but you can write the stuff

66
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:43,320
that itself write down and that's

67
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:48,300
JavaScript objects and so that's why and

68
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:50,610
that's the only reason why I built Jews

69
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:53,010
because I wanted to see can one build a

70
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:53,670
bootstrapping

71
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:55,080
object system in JavaScript and the

72
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:59,700
answers yes so developing juice itself

73
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:02,450
is fun so that's why I do it and

74
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:05,730
developing with Jews in my opinion is

75
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:15,109
fun too so yeah and to prove it I

76
00:04:15,109 --> 00:04:18,299
invented this and I took this from the

77
00:04:18,299 --> 00:04:21,420
new SQL Berlin make up scientific model

78
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:27,880
of object system awesomeness and

79
00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:31,130
languages and there are capabilities

80
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:36,240
let's start with classes of course Java

81
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,790
can do them small talk pretty much

82
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:41,190
invented them Ruby has them in

83
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:43,260
JavaScript you can do it if you know how

84
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:46,500
to do it of course and with juice that's

85
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:50,550
really easy prototypes and you might

86
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:52,680
agree disagree on some of these points

87
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,900
with me but it doesn't really matter you

88
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:57,300
can't do my Java no way in small talk

89
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:58,950
there's of course a way but you can't

90
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:01,770
really and Ruby no and JavaScript of

91
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:02,220
course

92
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:04,350
and what's juice you can still do them

93
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:05,610
so it's not really a class system

94
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:09,810
they're still prototypes around um same

95
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:11,460
thing with packages you have them in

96
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:12,510
Java yeah

97
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:14,460
having newer versions of small talk but

98
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:15,750
doesn't really work you have them in

99
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:17,760
Ruby Java trip of course you can't

100
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,710
emulate them in the comments folks that

101
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:21,150
were looking really hard on that and

102
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:26,280
there's those in juice mix-ins the Ruby

103
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,230
proof programmers that didn't boo on the

104
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:32,130
last talk they know or total those are

105
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:34,410
and you have Emma juice then there's

106
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:36,360
trades I don't know does everybody know

107
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:40,470
what that is the trade is something like

108
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:42,630
a more modern concept in object-oriented

109
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:43,320
programming

110
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:46,889
it's mixture between a mixin and an

111
00:05:46,889 --> 00:05:49,470
interface so I say you need to implement

112
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:52,020
that and for that I give you that and

113
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:53,490
the stuff that I'm giving you only

114
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:55,290
depends on the stuff that I want from

115
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:57,690
you

116
00:05:57,700 --> 00:06:00,170
then there's its really simple concept

117
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:01,370
it's really powerful

118
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:03,950
then there's method modifiers so say

119
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:05,990
after that has been done I want to do

120
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:07,850
something else that's something that's

121
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:10,520
of course really baking JavaScript hard

122
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,170
and other programming languages and

123
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:15,940
really easy with juice and then there's

124
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:20,750
yeah of course but it's more fun if you

125
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:30,190
put fail there there's five portions

126
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:34,190
what are type coercion you want to have

127
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:36,410
an integer and somebody puts you a

128
00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:39,770
string in there and you to say times two

129
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:43,430
and block everything fails that you can

130
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:45,590
declare and juice your this is an

131
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:47,450
integer and whatever you put in there

132
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:49,220
try to at least convert it to an integer

133
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:54,260
and do that declaratively and that's I

134
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:56,420
don't think that's available and in any

135
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:58,370
language it is like in Perl Ruby

136
00:06:58,370 --> 00:06:59,960
whatever they have type conversions for

137
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:04,370
the simple cases but you can say I want

138
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:09,830
things that look like a rocket to become

139
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:13,640
a rocket whatever so let's have a

140
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:16,130
conclusion here we have an epic fail on

141
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:20,180
the left side for Java Smalltalk kind of

142
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:22,450
failed in history

143
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:26,210
Ruby's medium fail javascript is good

144
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:27,920
for gurus because you can of course do

145
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:30,620
all that stuff it's not so easy most of

146
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:35,000
it or some of the time and juice is the

147
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,420
clear winner here

148
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:39,710
there's there's one more thing that I

149
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:45,260
forgot I've also added couch to be to

150
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:47,930
that list and it can do none of those

151
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:52,839
things

152
00:07:52,849 --> 00:07:55,110
well I admit that's kind of apples and

153
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:59,069
origins so yeah let me talk a little bit

154
00:07:59,069 --> 00:08:02,129
about juice it's all about embracing

155
00:08:02,129 --> 00:08:04,340
JavaScript because I love the language

156
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:06,960
and it gives you a large hammer when you

157
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,780
need increase expressivity

158
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:12,360
so in German that's I try them

159
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:17,400
simply write it down and next up I have

160
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:22,229
a couple examples for ya doing stuff

161
00:08:22,229 --> 00:08:27,060
with juice first one is this how to

162
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:31,050
write a point you say okay this is the

163
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:33,690
class and it's called point and it has

164
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:37,019
two instance variables one of them is X

165
00:08:37,019 --> 00:08:40,229
the other one is Y X is writable and

166
00:08:40,229 --> 00:08:43,140
readable and Y is writable and writable

167
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:46,730
and both are initialized with 0 unless

168
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:49,709
another form of initializer is provided

169
00:08:49,709 --> 00:08:52,769
and there's also method and it's called

170
00:08:52,769 --> 00:08:56,670
clear really easy and that's the

171
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:57,839
JavaScript object and you can

172
00:08:57,839 --> 00:08:59,339
instantiate it you can call methods

173
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:01,740
there's those metrics set X and set Y

174
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:04,380
methods because you declared that those

175
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:06,630
instance variables has accessors with

176
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:11,579
the is rw4 is readable and then of

177
00:09:11,579 --> 00:09:13,140
course you want to do inheritance and

178
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:16,350
you have the class point 3d and in it is

179
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:18,510
a point and it has another instance

180
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:22,290
variable coadley and after clear has

181
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:24,300
been called on the object we want to

182
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:29,010
clear z2 so we put it there so I was

183
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:31,440
talking about method modifiers after the

184
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,300
method modifier there's also before this

185
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:36,180
around this override there's augment

186
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:37,949
Auckland is cool item I'm not going to

187
00:09:37,949 --> 00:09:40,380
talk about it but it's for great minds

188
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:44,100
you can look it up so that's that's

189
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:47,970
classes there's of course modules and

190
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:50,519
you can put classes and modules really

191
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:52,990
boring

192
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:56,170
I was talking about trades actually in

193
00:09:56,170 --> 00:09:58,089
induced echo trolls because they're not

194
00:09:58,089 --> 00:10:00,100
truths trades because that you have

195
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,980
stayed not in this case Andrey declare

196
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:06,570
that the role comparable requires

197
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:09,279
classes or prototypes implementing that

198
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:12,940
role to provide the method comparable if

199
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:14,890
you do that you so nice

200
00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:17,320
then you will get those methods equal to

201
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:20,470
a greater than great greater than or

202
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:23,649
equal to which you can then apply to a

203
00:10:23,649 --> 00:10:26,110
class when you say the class currency

204
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:30,730
does comparable and has a method compare

205
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:35,740
so that class now can be asked to be

206
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:39,870
equal to something else so much for

207
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:44,080
roles let's go on to prototypes so you

208
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:47,860
can declare prototypes and Jews I'm

209
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:51,760
gonna go more into what meta classes are

210
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:55,149
in particular so difference between

211
00:10:55,149 --> 00:10:57,279
something declare there's a prototype

212
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:59,230
and something declared as a class it's

213
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:01,200
that things declared as a prototype

214
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:05,140
every instance that is created will get

215
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:08,649
its own meta class instance so whenever

216
00:11:08,649 --> 00:11:11,529
you make changes to buyer that meta

217
00:11:11,529 --> 00:11:14,800
class to the object then they will only

218
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:21,250
apply to that very single object yeah so

219
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:24,060
and by the way because we Umbro

220
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:26,880
embracing for the typical inheritance

221
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:30,100
there's a detach method on every method

222
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:33,100
every object insensate from jews classes

223
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:36,190
that detaches that object from the

224
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:38,680
original meta class instance and it gets

225
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:40,600
its own and you can do it everything you

226
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:48,430
want back to type coercion type coercion

227
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:51,010
to declare type and it can use something

228
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:53,860
else and you say where in this case if

229
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:55,839
value is larger than born in smaller

230
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:58,899
than five then it's that's actually a my

231
00:11:58,899 --> 00:12:00,830
small number and

232
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:02,870
then there's um otherwise it's not and

233
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:04,790
there is a coerce function that says

234
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:08,149
something from Jews type string is

235
00:12:08,149 --> 00:12:12,050
getting coerced to a number via return

236
00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:19,730
new number and string in other words of

237
00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:23,329
course it can set the string and it will

238
00:12:23,329 --> 00:12:27,140
be automatically cursed and oh that

239
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:32,540
might feel x 2 will then alert 6 I think

240
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:34,940
it would otherwise too good for a matter

241
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:38,600
of convenience and that's that's how its

242
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:41,839
declared so in the attribute you declare

243
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:44,269
this is a juice type my small number and

244
00:12:44,269 --> 00:12:47,480
you activate coerce it has to be

245
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:48,680
activated because it's really expensive

246
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:52,220
and you don't always want it as you can

247
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:54,019
see you can declare attributes on

248
00:12:54,019 --> 00:12:56,510
attributes that's of course because

249
00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:58,610
attributes are do have metaclasses too

250
00:12:58,610 --> 00:13:00,260
so not all in class the metaclass about

251
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:02,870
attributes and methods and whatever do

252
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:11,450
have to I think might have been a little

253
00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:14,860
boring but there's more code coming

254
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:17,959
because of course that was all really

255
00:13:17,959 --> 00:13:20,089
boring so let's drove into a meta class

256
00:13:20,089 --> 00:13:24,110
programming declaring a new meta class

257
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:26,570
is really easy you just declare a class

258
00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:29,320
and you inherit from juice dot class

259
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:32,240
because that's the regular meta class

260
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:38,089
and then you can declare new methods on

261
00:13:38,089 --> 00:13:38,899
the metaclass

262
00:13:38,899 --> 00:13:40,910
and there is a special thing that I want

263
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:43,339
to talk about is you've seen those

264
00:13:43,339 --> 00:13:46,520
things in plastic locations like methods

265
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:51,020
and has a Nissa those are actually

266
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:53,029
methods which will be eventually caught

267
00:13:53,029 --> 00:13:55,160
in the meta class so you can completely

268
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:57,649
control what they do and you can declare

269
00:13:57,649 --> 00:14:00,470
much more of those properties like it in

270
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:03,160
this case with programming stuff to

271
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:06,230
enable us to declare events within

272
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:10,040
classes so here we define that mess

273
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:13,579
handle flop events and then afterwards I

274
00:14:13,579 --> 00:14:16,339
go forward you have a class declaration

275
00:14:16,339 --> 00:14:18,259
you say this the metaclass of this class

276
00:14:18,259 --> 00:14:20,389
is the controller Matic class and then

277
00:14:20,389 --> 00:14:21,860
you have can have those events

278
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:26,170
properties and declare events which will

279
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:29,480
be bound to the documents and which can

280
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:31,699
other things can publish to so that's

281
00:14:31,699 --> 00:14:35,920
just some way on two declaratively

282
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:40,759
declare stuff which is cool and while I

283
00:14:40,759 --> 00:14:41,660
was working on this presentation

284
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:43,430
actually on the way back from Burlington

285
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:45,860
where I lived in Hamburg I had any to

286
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:50,480
give I'm a Twitter it of course before I

287
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,920
started working on it

288
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:54,649
but of course it's really ugly that

289
00:14:54,649 --> 00:14:56,779
declaring handle prop he wins whatever

290
00:14:56,779 --> 00:15:01,190
name mangling not done well so we can

291
00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:02,899
make that even nicer if you use meta

292
00:15:02,899 --> 00:15:07,670
meta programming and so I implemented

293
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:09,440
actually within the Jews class handle

294
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:16,279
properties and you know there and now

295
00:15:16,279 --> 00:15:18,829
the original source code looks like this

296
00:15:18,829 --> 00:15:22,040
so now the new meta class can declare

297
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:25,160
that implements the property events

298
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:29,660
which is in my world way nicer than name

299
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:33,380
angling and of course now you can also

300
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:36,050
eat more easily override whatever that

301
00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:39,399
handle properties do and yeah it's fun

302
00:15:39,399 --> 00:15:43,970
anyway that's so much for the short

303
00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:47,660
introduction to juice there's always the

304
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:54,470
question telecom was overhead yes using

305
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:56,990
Jews will really slow your application

306
00:15:56,990 --> 00:16:03,260
down about this much so it's not really

307
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:06,170
slow and if you're doing for example

308
00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:09,529
jQuery programming and at document ready

309
00:16:09,529 --> 00:16:13,189
time you're binding stuff to a class to

310
00:16:13,189 --> 00:16:16,850
all objects or all text with a certain

311
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:18,949
class that takes a while and it's so

312
00:16:18,949 --> 00:16:21,170
much slower than compiling

313
00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:22,610
normal Jews code that it doesn't really

314
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:26,000
matter so you can use it and we do use

315
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,630
it in production quite a lot speaking of

316
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:32,810
the Dom its tested well to work with

317
00:16:32,810 --> 00:16:34,880
jQuery prototype actually with some

318
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,760
limitations because I have a prototype

319
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:39,829
keyword and it doesn't work so well with

320
00:16:39,829 --> 00:16:43,910
prototype and it works well with dojo

321
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:46,880
and Yui of course and everything else to

322
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:50,149
it because it doesn't do much so this is

323
00:16:50,149 --> 00:16:53,089
of course a message to Jews is not like

324
00:16:53,089 --> 00:16:54,470
in their journal as if to any other

325
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:56,510
framework which is something used extra

326
00:16:56,510 --> 00:17:01,399
and more important especially at this

327
00:17:01,399 --> 00:17:03,800
conference is that it allows the server

328
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,780
as well and we actually do use it in

329
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:09,770
heavy production on Rhino and there's no

330
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:13,250
reason to not work if we ate in

331
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:17,020
SpiderMonkey and when I first joined

332
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:19,760
Sonora I worked on a c-sharp project

333
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,939
instead of course I poured it tunes to

334
00:17:22,939 --> 00:17:28,850
jscript.net which was kind of tough yeah

335
00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:30,980
I said that already so it's been on in

336
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:32,660
production on the server side since

337
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:39,270
early 2009 and it didn't crash too often

338
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:44,559
getting back to why it should use those

339
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:47,350
strange loops are fun they really are

340
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:51,320
and when you use juice you have really

341
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,630
cool strange loops and you have

342
00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:56,570
increased expressivity which I call

343
00:17:56,570 --> 00:18:02,120
strange expressive 'ti and yeah go for

344
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:02,299
it

345
00:18:02,299 --> 00:18:05,600
give it a ride at code.google.com /p

346
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:09,770
slash juice - Jas there's an ISDN

347
00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:11,840
channel and of course everything's on

348
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:18,049
github and that should be it thanks for

349
00:18:18,049 --> 00:18:20,480
listening visit my blog and follow me on

350
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:31,520
Twitter any questions

351
00:18:31,530 --> 00:18:40,600
any questions

352
00:18:40,610 --> 00:18:44,289
yeah

353
00:18:44,299 --> 00:18:46,039
I think the question was multiple

354
00:18:46,039 --> 00:18:49,729
inheritance of course you can overwrite

355
00:18:49,729 --> 00:18:53,149
the handle prop is a method or implement

356
00:18:53,149 --> 00:18:56,029
it's or whatever and allowed to accept

357
00:18:56,029 --> 00:19:03,830
an array but I didn't of course and what

358
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:07,190
is possible is to declare as many roles

359
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:10,820
as the class can do as you want so you

360
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:14,299
can vote for traits there's actually a

361
00:19:14,299 --> 00:19:17,419
mathematical model for composition which

362
00:19:17,419 --> 00:19:19,940
avoids most of pretty much all of the

363
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:22,519
pitfalls associated with multiple

364
00:19:22,519 --> 00:19:26,029
inheritance and so you can you can wrote
