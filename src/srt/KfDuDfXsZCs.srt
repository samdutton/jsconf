1
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:20,900

I know I stand on the way between you

2
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:23,960
and and and the party after that so I'm

3
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:26,330
going to try to be entertaining anyway I

4
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:29,000
spoke with Tomas a long time ago saying

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,220
this conference is a great place to

6
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:33,500
actually meet the web developers and we

7
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,990
wanted to interact a little bit more and

8
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:38,270
let you know about all the web evolve

9
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:41,090
right so I invited one of my mentor

10
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:43,070
Danielle Burnett that has been an

11
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:45,440
invited expert in a chairman for a long

12
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:50,360
time next slide then and what we really

13
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:52,550
want to speak about today is free

14
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:54,530
question right now was the web aney

15
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:59,300
internet created next slide Oh does it

16
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:01,310
keep evolving well you saw a lot of

17
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:03,560
example yesterday and today I SWAT least

18
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:05,840
22 presentation today speaking about

19
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,440
HTTP to that was created in something

20
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:11,450
called IETF and all the working group

21
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:13,220
and so on and so forth so how does it

22
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:15,470
work exactly you know can you not only

23
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:17,690
benefit from it but create the next

24
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:21,110
version of the web html5 HTML 6 next

25
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:24,680
slide and even better how can you

26
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:27,170
actually take the control and go on the

27
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:29,299
driver's seat and say I want to be part

28
00:01:29,299 --> 00:01:31,850
of HTML 6 I have some very very good

29
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:33,590
idea and I don't want that to be on the

30
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:35,960
framework I want it to be the next the

31
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:38,299
next web I want to make a difference i

32
00:01:38,299 --> 00:01:39,650
want to change the word and i want it

33
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:42,020
better than flappy bird to write so

34
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:43,790
that's basically the free question we're

35
00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:45,770
going to try to to address during the

36
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:52,070
presentation today we using a web RTC

37
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:54,080
technology right now which is part of

38
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:56,960
html5 to screen do slides directly from

39
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,479
atlanta and danielle is going to join us

40
00:01:59,479 --> 00:02:02,750
from there directly next slide that's

41
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:04,070
what i'm saying next slide all the time

42
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:07,850
he has a control so we are we my name is

43
00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:10,429
unpronounceable so everybody call me dr.

44
00:02:10,429 --> 00:02:13,880
alex and i'm an invited expert

45
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:16,880
as ietf w3c and a few other standard

46
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:19,070
committee in the word with a speciality

47
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:21,530
on web RTC and what makes me a little

48
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:23,300
bit different is I'm the only one from

49
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:24,920
Southeast Asia attending these meetings

50
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:27,830
and I'm based in Singapore so I wanted

51
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:29,150
to give back a little bit to the

52
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:30,980
southeast asia and Singapore community

53
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:34,700
and now i will let dan introduced

54
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:40,700
himself and we don't have audio wait

55
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:47,240
then we don't hear you so it's

56
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:49,160
supposedly plugged in can someone from

57
00:02:49,160 --> 00:03:00,160
the technical staff give us a hand here

58
00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:10,440
good I look I got that here

59
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:14,080
go on diamond try again hi everyone you

60
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,180
know yet here's something we hear from

61
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:22,750
the back but not the beauty of

62
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:29,230
technology somebody running can you say

63
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:32,830
again yes we can hear him from the back

64
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:34,930
but it doesn't seem to be connected to

65
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:59,630
the speakers Cooper

66
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,470
that's

67
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:05,580
yeah this one so you're already on the

68
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:21,060
right one then do not sing but please

69
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:22,860
say something so they can taste the Sun

70
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:26,220
yes testing all right fantastic all

71
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:31,410
right it happens all the time when the

72
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:33,810
streaming is the local microphone does

73
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:36,660
is so there's a lot of things that

74
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:39,690
happen in a streaming of media audio and

75
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:41,430
video and most of the time the problem

76
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:43,350
is between the keyboard and the seat but

77
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:47,400
not always all right done all yours okay

78
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:52,140
yes so hi everyone yes so I've been

79
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:55,140
involved with w3c and IETF two

80
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:56,610
organizations I'm going to be talking

81
00:04:56,610 --> 00:04:59,880
about today for for many years I started

82
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:05,820
in 99 and w3c and 2001 in ITF I've been

83
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:09,290
an editor of many specifications in w3c

84
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:12,510
currently one of the primary editors of

85
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:15,990
the WebRTC specification and and some

86
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:19,950
other other work going on right now but

87
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:21,810
let's go ahead and move right on into

88
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:29,520
the presentation okay so the first thing

89
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,040
I wanted to talk about is something that

90
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,470
probably many of you know but possibly

91
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:37,560
not all of you people often use the term

92
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:40,830
web the terms web and Internet done

93
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:43,320
interchangeably yes we do not have the

94
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:46,380
slide on screen you did not have the

95
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:48,479
slides please can you scream you or can

96
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:56,540
you share you yes yes

97
00:05:56,550 --> 00:06:01,720
did not share them this time not yet

98
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:06,639
yeah I saw myself for a minute that was

99
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:09,190
frightening can you please focus on the

100
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:16,380
slides okay can you see them now perfect

101
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:23,410
okay here we go alright so the web is

102
00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:26,979
not the internet right the internet is

103
00:06:26,979 --> 00:06:30,370
the plumbing it's all the stuff at the

104
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:34,270
low level that actually controls how

105
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:37,000
information flows from one place to

106
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:44,940
another so it's the plumbing HTTP https

107
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:49,180
email dns the internet protocol itself

108
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:54,389
of course tcp UDP all of these are

109
00:06:54,389 --> 00:06:58,930
internet level protocols the web is

110
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:04,570
about content primarily HTML I'll talk

111
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:08,949
more about that in a minute Alex do you

112
00:07:08,949 --> 00:07:10,659
want to say something about the Rhine

113
00:07:10,659 --> 00:07:13,150
slightly and we did the slide with two

114
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:15,580
levels in mind the global level right so

115
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:17,260
you guys get the global process and

116
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:19,270
everything and then in a different color

117
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:21,729
things that can be more of interest to

118
00:07:21,729 --> 00:07:23,669
the local people or the Asian community

119
00:07:23,669 --> 00:07:27,280
so the government of Singapore recognize

120
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,960
the difference between internet and the

121
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,849
web and has created two different

122
00:07:30,849 --> 00:07:33,190
agencies to actually deal with that so I

123
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:35,110
da is the one taking care of the

124
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:36,449
internet and the infrastructure

125
00:07:36,449 --> 00:07:39,430
including big data for smart nation in

126
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:42,130
Singapore and MDA is going to be the

127
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:45,070
media development authority that take

128
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:48,280
care about the content and blocking some

129
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:50,050
internet site if they disagree with the

130
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:52,360
content and everything that is related

131
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,639
to multimedia application so when you

132
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:56,320
guys deal with that with the local

133
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:58,389
government keep that in mind even though

134
00:07:58,389 --> 00:08:00,130
recently I think they fuse the two

135
00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:05,500
agencies okay

136
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,790
so I want to just give very brief

137
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:12,910
history of internet and web so the

138
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:15,770
internet was started as as many of you

139
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:19,640
know probably as a US government Defense

140
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,860
Department project to connect

141
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:24,920
universities and the US government and

142
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:29,020
then it actually it grew rather rapidly

143
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:32,690
to be a set of a collection of different

144
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:35,690
networks and they quickly realized that

145
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:39,530
there was a need for a better way to

146
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:42,410
connect them together and that way was

147
00:08:42,410 --> 00:08:45,320
the Internet Protocol right so the one

148
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:48,050
that connects different networks so even

149
00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:52,360
though today we think of the Internet as

150
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:56,740
one way basically a way for any computer

151
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:59,960
to directly connect to any other

152
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:03,410
computer it originally started as just a

153
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:07,670
way to connect different local networks

154
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:10,460
and actually that is what the internet

155
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:14,150
is today despite our attempts to pretend

156
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:15,800
otherwise with network address

157
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:20,470
translators and so on of course ipv6

158
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:25,210
promises the hope that we can still I

159
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:30,740
guess we can go back to the original or

160
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:33,860
go go to a notion where you can connect

161
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:37,700
directly from one machine to another but

162
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:40,100
we probably will end up keeping gnats

163
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:42,470
and firewalls for all the wonderful

164
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:45,730
policy reasons that we know about today

165
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:49,730
so that's the internet it wasn't

166
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:53,330
actually until a good bit later that Tim

167
00:09:53,330 --> 00:09:56,510
berners-lee a researcher at CERN in

168
00:09:56,510 --> 00:10:01,580
Switzerland created HTTP the hypertext

169
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:06,800
Transfer Protocol and HTML the hypertext

170
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:10,190
markup language what Tim realized he was

171
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:11,870
actually working with other researchers

172
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:16,220
and realized that at the time there were

173
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:17,870
different protocols for getting

174
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:18,590
different

175
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:25,490
of information ftp archie gopher these

176
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:27,200
were all different protocols for getting

177
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,590
information at the time and it was it

178
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:33,170
was a nuisance having to remember which

179
00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:36,400
protocol you were using when really as

180
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:39,340
an end user all you cared about was

181
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:42,080
being able to access information and

182
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:44,180
that was stored somewhere other than on

183
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:48,880
your machine so by creating this

184
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,680
standard protocol for fetching resources

185
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:56,930
and then creating a language HTML that

186
00:10:56,930 --> 00:10:59,180
made it very easy to link to and

187
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:03,590
reference resources and other places he

188
00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:05,750
dramatically simplified the use of the

189
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:09,590
internet so that's I think the main

190
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:12,860
reason why people in general refer to

191
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:14,840
these two as the same thing today even

192
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,970
though they're not and that's because of

193
00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:20,570
what Tim berners-lee did now Tim

194
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:23,090
berners-lee did go on also to create the

195
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:24,920
world wide web consortium which I'll

196
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:27,590
talk about in a moment so this is where

197
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:32,330
the internet and the web came from but I

198
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:35,870
guess a good question now is where does

199
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:37,520
it come from today what happens when

200
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:40,100
changes need to be made and the answer

201
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:44,090
is all of us we are the ones who make

202
00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:45,830
the internet we are the ones who make

203
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:48,860
the web as you know the internet today

204
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:53,390
is not controlled by any one entity any

205
00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:56,180
one organization there are organizations

206
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:59,720
that have strong influence over some of

207
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:02,930
the architecture of the Internet but it

208
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:05,180
is all of the devices all of the

209
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:07,010
individual networks that exist around

210
00:12:07,010 --> 00:12:10,150
the world that make up the internet and

211
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:12,800
it is all of the content that all of us

212
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,800
create and all of you in particular that

213
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:20,630
is the that is the web but of course all

214
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:23,330
of this works because of standards that

215
00:12:23,330 --> 00:12:27,140
exist and it is the standards bodies for

216
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:32,140
the internet and the web that

217
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:36,740
define the protocols and the floor mats

218
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:41,870
that make things actually work so one

219
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:45,320
interesting question something surprises

220
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:49,100
many people is how the standards

221
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:52,460
actually get enforced and the truth is

222
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:54,320
they're they're not I'm going to be

223
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,290
talking about the organizations involved

224
00:12:57,290 --> 00:13:01,640
in just a moment but these organizations

225
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:06,580
are are not official in the sense that

226
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:11,510
that governmental bodies drive them or

227
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:15,320
or support them actually the standards

228
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:18,590
for the internet and the web are just

229
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:20,660
documents created by smart people and

230
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:23,000
people use them because they're good

231
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,090
they're good quality I'm going so really

232
00:13:26,090 --> 00:13:28,520
i'm going to interject here than to

233
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:31,190
really rebound on that there is no

234
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:34,040
internet police there is no web police

235
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:36,890
either right and the fact the thing is

236
00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:38,840
the people that actually create the web

237
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,640
are people that are using it so they

238
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,410
have a tendency of doing the right thing

239
00:13:42,410 --> 00:13:45,230
and i think again if I I have to give an

240
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:50,640
example that you saw today is HTTP to

241
00:13:50,650 --> 00:13:54,050
HTTPS really better than HTTP right is

242
00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:56,090
really going to address a pain point you

243
00:13:56,090 --> 00:13:59,510
have today it's faster it's easier to

244
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:01,310
use it has a lot of things that were

245
00:14:01,310 --> 00:14:03,980
learned from HTTP and that evolved into

246
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:06,650
something something better and adapt to

247
00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:09,050
the current tool but for that to be

248
00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:10,910
possible right we need to have feedback

249
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:13,070
from the people that actually use the

250
00:14:13,070 --> 00:14:15,710
tool so we get back to that later but we

251
00:14:15,710 --> 00:14:17,420
need to know what the pain point hard

252
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:19,160
today with the current technology to

253
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,930
make the next better one right and

254
00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:22,910
you're not going to use them because

255
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:26,930
they exist right they are a lot of RFC

256
00:14:26,930 --> 00:14:30,140
so specifications are sleeping dormant

257
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:32,240
because nobody really use them and that

258
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,490
we pushed by the industry and there

259
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:36,560
others like HTTP to that really really

260
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:39,320
address abandon are going to be used and

261
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:42,500
half of the people including done in

262
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,819
myself that go to those committees on

263
00:14:44,819 --> 00:14:47,789
not paid to do so which is going there

264
00:14:47,789 --> 00:14:49,739
to do the right thing and because they

265
00:14:49,739 --> 00:14:51,660
believe in into making the web a better

266
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:56,939
place with you feedback right the news

267
00:14:56,939 --> 00:15:00,809
rapportage exactly exactly there's

268
00:15:00,809 --> 00:15:03,689
there's no one who actually makes us do

269
00:15:03,689 --> 00:15:07,369
it of course there are as Alex said

270
00:15:07,369 --> 00:15:09,539
probably about half the people who are

271
00:15:09,539 --> 00:15:12,660
there are there not because they have a

272
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:16,109
specific company position to represent

273
00:15:16,109 --> 00:15:18,929
but they're there because they feel

274
00:15:18,929 --> 00:15:23,669
strongly about the the protocols and the

275
00:15:23,669 --> 00:15:26,549
format's doing the right thing this is

276
00:15:26,549 --> 00:15:30,660
really significant okay there are many

277
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:33,149
other skin standards organizations in

278
00:15:33,149 --> 00:15:35,399
the world probably the most well-known

279
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:40,879
ones in the tech space are the ITU gsm a

280
00:15:40,879 --> 00:15:45,350
3gpp etc and these organizations create

281
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:48,779
very good and useful standards primarily

282
00:15:48,779 --> 00:15:52,159
for the telephony and mobile telephony

283
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:55,499
industries but for the internet and the

284
00:15:55,499 --> 00:15:57,839
web there there is no governmental

285
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:00,989
supported it really is just a group of

286
00:16:00,989 --> 00:16:04,199
nerds they get together and and try to

287
00:16:04,199 --> 00:16:07,109
make the right thing happen and so some

288
00:16:07,109 --> 00:16:09,269
people actually join some company

289
00:16:09,269 --> 00:16:11,339
because of that beliefs everybody i know

290
00:16:11,339 --> 00:16:14,639
that work at mozilla which is a non for

291
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:17,669
nonprofit organization is participating

292
00:16:17,669 --> 00:16:19,859
to the specification to try to make the

293
00:16:19,859 --> 00:16:21,899
web a better place not because they're

294
00:16:21,899 --> 00:16:23,549
getting paid to do it that's actually

295
00:16:23,549 --> 00:16:25,220
the other way around so that's a really

296
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:28,289
exciting place to be to be surrounded by

297
00:16:28,289 --> 00:16:29,999
people that are not there because they

298
00:16:29,999 --> 00:16:32,609
paid not there because the company has

299
00:16:32,609 --> 00:16:34,919
an incentive or pushing their technology

300
00:16:34,919 --> 00:16:37,319
in one way or another but really trying

301
00:16:37,319 --> 00:16:40,109
to do the best thing for everybody out

302
00:16:40,109 --> 00:16:42,629
there that's really rewarding for an

303
00:16:42,629 --> 00:16:46,350
individual yeah at the last I ETF

304
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:49,799
meeting that they just happened recently

305
00:16:49,799 --> 00:16:52,439
I was talking with to first-time

306
00:16:52,439 --> 00:16:55,289
attendees one from Tunisia and one from

307
00:16:55,289 --> 00:16:57,889
Pakistan and both of them

308
00:16:57,889 --> 00:17:03,109
were really amazed mostly at the quality

309
00:17:03,109 --> 00:17:05,449
of the conversations that happen they

310
00:17:05,449 --> 00:17:07,100
were surprised to find that they could

311
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:10,220
walk into those meetings and be talking

312
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:13,250
with people directly at a deep technical

313
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:16,069
level that is exactly what you can

314
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:19,039
expect organizations like that because

315
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:20,750
again it is the people who want the

316
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:22,159
right thing to happen you know what's

317
00:17:22,159 --> 00:17:25,970
going on who will debate what should be

318
00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:31,549
done and definitely if if an idea is bad

319
00:17:31,549 --> 00:17:33,620
you'll hear about it but if an idea is

320
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:36,440
good people will will listen to it as

321
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:40,159
well ok so the IETF the internet

322
00:17:40,159 --> 00:17:42,830
Engineering Task Force is the group that

323
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:44,990
defines the protocols for the internet

324
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:48,130
and it really is free to participate

325
00:17:48,130 --> 00:17:51,350
there is a cost if you want to attend

326
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:53,149
the face-to-face meetings and that's

327
00:17:53,149 --> 00:17:56,360
just because it costs money to reserve

328
00:17:56,360 --> 00:18:00,080
the space but keep in mind that the

329
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:03,230
reason for that is that there is no one

330
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:06,080
company sponsoring the entire event they

331
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:10,070
do get corporate sponsors but the core

332
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:12,620
of the meeting itself is supported by

333
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:16,250
the fees that people k to attend and

334
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:18,049
that's only when you attend the

335
00:18:18,049 --> 00:18:21,110
face-to-face meetings actually all of

336
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:23,149
the work is done or the majority of the

337
00:18:23,149 --> 00:18:25,639
work is done on the mailing list yeah

338
00:18:25,639 --> 00:18:28,330
the remote one seat the remote Pacific

339
00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:30,860
participation to IETF is free there is

340
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:33,139
no membership fee and everybody

341
00:18:33,139 --> 00:18:35,240
represent only himself right so you

342
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,830
don't represent a company or anything

343
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:38,899
and really the the idea behind that is

344
00:18:38,899 --> 00:18:40,760
the Internet is free and everybody

345
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:43,370
should be equal in voicing which we

346
00:18:43,370 --> 00:18:45,919
should go ITF meetings are the only

347
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:47,809
meetings where you are maybe thirty five

348
00:18:47,809 --> 00:18:49,340
percent of the audience which are

349
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:51,830
actually students that take the

350
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:54,220
opportunity you having those meetings

351
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:57,679
locally to learn from from other people

352
00:18:57,679 --> 00:18:59,919
and to learn how it happens I etfs that

353
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:03,289
rotation rule where you're going to have

354
00:19:03,289 --> 00:19:05,360
three meetings a year and one meeting

355
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:08,149
per continent to give everybody almost

356
00:19:08,149 --> 00:19:10,650
equal opportunity to at least one

357
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:12,330
so you're drawing the meeting and learn

358
00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:15,090
and participate right everything else is

359
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:19,740
done online for free right at them the

360
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:22,800
main reason front of these place to face

361
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:25,380
meetings is to get to meet other people

362
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:28,140
working in your area and in other areas

363
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:30,900
so again that's not where the majority

364
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:33,660
of the work happens but I would

365
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:35,100
encourage you if you've been

366
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:37,050
participating on the mailing list for a

367
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:38,640
while definitely get started on the

368
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,230
mailing list but if you've been

369
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:42,060
participating for a while on the mailing

370
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:44,490
list you might want to try attending one

371
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:46,710
of the meetings just to give you another

372
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:51,150
example of how hard the IETF tries to

373
00:19:51,150 --> 00:19:54,810
make it easy for any person to

374
00:19:54,810 --> 00:19:58,320
participate there's one one thing that

375
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,510
people do at meetings that seems strange

376
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:03,810
you to most first-time visitors and that

377
00:20:03,810 --> 00:20:06,840
is when it comes time to vote or get an

378
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:11,640
idea in in the room how how people feel

379
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,440
about perhaps one approach versus

380
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,780
another approach instead of actually

381
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:20,490
doing a vote the IETF takes a hum and

382
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:22,560
that's where they just ask each person

383
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:25,950
to hum for what their for their choice

384
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:29,220
and they did that because when they

385
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:31,470
early on when they had people raised

386
00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:33,900
raised their hands to indicate what they

387
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:36,900
were interested in they found that if

388
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:38,610
someone was sitting there let's say

389
00:20:38,610 --> 00:20:40,260
you're a technical person attending and

390
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:43,980
your boss is also there with you you

391
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:45,540
might have a different opinion from your

392
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:48,120
boss and you might be afraid to raise

393
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:52,320
your hand because you you might not want

394
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,420
your your boss to see that that's your

395
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:55,880
opinion because it might not be

396
00:20:55,880 --> 00:21:02,100
considered appropriate by your boss but

397
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:04,410
when when people home it's very hard to

398
00:21:04,410 --> 00:21:07,200
tell where the hums are coming from so

399
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,030
that was actually done specifically to

400
00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:11,370
make it so that you can have your vote

401
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:14,610
count and have it be anonymous just to

402
00:21:14,610 --> 00:21:17,490
guarantee that you actually get the real

403
00:21:17,490 --> 00:21:19,920
opinions of the people in the room now

404
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:22,290
again it's only what happens on the

405
00:21:22,290 --> 00:21:24,120
mailing list that's official but

406
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:25,800
that can be good for getting a general

407
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:29,730
idea for for which approaches people

408
00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:35,550
prefer now what is the IETF do a guide

409
00:21:35,550 --> 00:21:38,910
TF creates rfcs requests for comments

410
00:21:38,910 --> 00:21:40,890
another funny name basically that's the

411
00:21:40,890 --> 00:21:45,420
end stage process in the IETF is the

412
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:48,030
request for comment I'm not going to be

413
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:50,190
talking today primarily about the IETF

414
00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:54,300
process I wanted to to focus more on the

415
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:56,760
w3c process but Alex maybe you could say

416
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:59,520
just a little bit about this right the

417
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:03,270
good news is I told you once every year

418
00:22:03,270 --> 00:22:05,430
you have free meetings right one in

419
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:07,800
every continent and the last one is

420
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,660
always in Asia and it's been

421
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:13,110
traditionally in North Asia so far it

422
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:16,080
was in Beijing the year before it was in

423
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,630
sayville two weeks ago next year is

424
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:20,430
going to be in Singapore right and

425
00:22:20,430 --> 00:22:22,650
almost fully found it so everybody that

426
00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:25,170
is in Southeast Asia will have something

427
00:22:25,170 --> 00:22:27,750
more local to actually go to and

428
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:30,510
interact with all the people that create

429
00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:32,790
http/2 and create all the cool

430
00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:35,070
technology that you saw example of today

431
00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:37,470
so that's a great opportunity to

432
00:22:37,470 --> 00:22:39,690
actually go and mingle with people and

433
00:22:39,690 --> 00:22:42,060
ask question it's not every day that you

434
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:43,890
can actually see it another coffee with

435
00:22:43,890 --> 00:22:46,590
a chief architect of Microsoft edge and

436
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:48,870
and that kind of people and ask them any

437
00:22:48,870 --> 00:22:51,780
question about not what they did put

438
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:53,790
why'd they did that today you so a lot

439
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:56,250
of example of what you can do with HTTP

440
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:58,350
too but then you don't know why they

441
00:22:58,350 --> 00:23:00,000
make this choice and not another choice

442
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,620
what are the next feature and swans

443
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:04,020
those guys can answer those question

444
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:05,820
right so I think it's a great

445
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:07,920
opportunity and I encourage everybody to

446
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:12,330
go there next year november and raffle

447
00:23:12,330 --> 00:23:16,950
hotel thank you since this is a

448
00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:18,570
developer conference i want to talk more

449
00:23:18,570 --> 00:23:21,030
about w3c now so the world wide web

450
00:23:21,030 --> 00:23:24,530
consortium is the one that defines HTML

451
00:23:24,530 --> 00:23:26,970
membership is officially by company but

452
00:23:26,970 --> 00:23:29,580
remember participation is free on the

453
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:33,770
mailing list there is one global

454
00:23:33,770 --> 00:23:37,180
combined meeting a year all the tea

455
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:39,760
but there are typically weekly calls and

456
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:42,250
other face-to-face meetings for the

457
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:45,940
individual groups what w3c as is to

458
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:51,520
create recommendations so in w3c if you

459
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:54,340
have an idea you can actually go and

460
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:58,240
create a community group you need one

461
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:01,750
member of w3c to support you and then I

462
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:05,320
met other people beyond that who express

463
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:06,670
interest in it but with that you can

464
00:24:06,670 --> 00:24:09,250
create a community group no cost to you

465
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:11,950
mailing list only but it's a great place

466
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:14,230
to discuss now the moment you want to

467
00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:16,530
actually create a standard you need to

468
00:24:16,530 --> 00:24:19,750
move on to the standards track and for

469
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:22,590
that you need a officially created

470
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:25,870
working room I fink then Gabby Tracy I

471
00:24:25,870 --> 00:24:28,540
think people don't stress enough the

472
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:30,400
wonderful tool the community group is

473
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:34,180
and I want to give a few example people

474
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:36,670
in in Japan say a would like to see

475
00:24:36,670 --> 00:24:39,190
about IPTV or we want to see about a

476
00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:42,670
media display web in vehicle in cars

477
00:24:42,670 --> 00:24:46,060
right or in sub when things like that we

478
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:48,160
don't know yet if it's going to be

479
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,960
interesting we just want to work create

480
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:52,360
a group and be recognized you can go

481
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:54,160
ahead and create a community group in a

482
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:56,350
few weeks you won't be able to make a

483
00:24:56,350 --> 00:24:59,370
standard yet but you can do all the the

484
00:24:59,370 --> 00:25:01,840
preparatory work for standard if you

485
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:04,030
want to and that allows you to have the

486
00:25:04,030 --> 00:25:06,370
full weight of the w3c behind you and

487
00:25:06,370 --> 00:25:08,500
the full organization with people that

488
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:11,710
can help you actually prepare organize

489
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:14,260
go in touch with the industry and so on

490
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:16,210
and so forth so community group are

491
00:25:16,210 --> 00:25:18,850
extremely cheap to organize their not

492
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:22,480
limited to any ID that's really a great

493
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,370
introduction for people to have an ID

494
00:25:24,370 --> 00:25:27,210
and would like to learn or explore or to

495
00:25:27,210 --> 00:25:29,230
work with the with the standard

496
00:25:29,230 --> 00:25:30,970
committee and the industry that's

497
00:25:30,970 --> 00:25:32,770
something that can be done in a in the

498
00:25:32,770 --> 00:25:35,770
scope of a school program with the

499
00:25:35,770 --> 00:25:37,570
excellent University we have here in

500
00:25:37,570 --> 00:25:38,740
Singapore I think that's something

501
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:41,470
that's really underused today and it's

502
00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:45,370
free absolutely and in fact it's what

503
00:25:45,370 --> 00:25:48,330
w3c is encouraging people to start with

504
00:25:48,330 --> 00:25:51,330
w3c is more and more ass

505
00:25:51,330 --> 00:25:53,380
individuals with ideas to start

506
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:56,560
community groups and then only request a

507
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:58,180
working group once they've gotten to

508
00:25:58,180 --> 00:26:01,510
where there is very clear clear

509
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:04,450
agreement on a path to proceed within a

510
00:26:04,450 --> 00:26:08,500
community group so officially I'm not

511
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:10,210
going to go through this in detail there

512
00:26:10,210 --> 00:26:14,740
are basically two main group stages in

513
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:17,080
the standards process there's working

514
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:19,030
draft and then there are various stages

515
00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:21,760
of the recommendation the working draft

516
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,170
stage is when you're working on the

517
00:26:23,170 --> 00:26:26,200
document but at some point you think

518
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:29,230
your document is complete and now you

519
00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:31,030
need to just demonstrate that it can be

520
00:26:31,030 --> 00:26:32,440
implemented and that's the candidate

521
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:36,100
recommendation stage so the two main

522
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:38,590
areas you'll see documents in or the

523
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:40,840
working draft stage and the candidate

524
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:43,660
recommendation stage there's a proposed

525
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:45,250
recommendation stage which is mainly

526
00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:47,650
just like a one month placeholder before

527
00:26:47,650 --> 00:26:49,270
it goes to recommendation to make sure

528
00:26:49,270 --> 00:26:51,850
nothing is is fully broken but just

529
00:26:51,850 --> 00:26:53,110
think of it this way working draft

530
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:54,520
you're working on it trying to get it

531
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:56,470
technically complete and candidate

532
00:26:56,470 --> 00:26:57,820
recommendation is when you're trying to

533
00:26:57,820 --> 00:26:59,560
get implementations to demonstrate that

534
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:02,350
it really does work now unofficially of

535
00:27:02,350 --> 00:27:04,540
course the real process that you're

536
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:06,460
steadily increasing mindshare and that's

537
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:08,410
why you begin with a community group you

538
00:27:08,410 --> 00:27:10,660
give people interested agreeing on what

539
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:12,820
the real problems are and what direction

540
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:15,580
might be for solution and then in the

541
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:17,530
standards process you actually begin to

542
00:27:17,530 --> 00:27:19,660
involve wider and you get wider and

543
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:22,360
wider involvement from other groups

544
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:24,760
besides yours to make sure that you're

545
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:27,100
not going to break anything in the

546
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:29,050
standard and it's very important to

547
00:27:29,050 --> 00:27:30,490
understand that it's only those who

548
00:27:30,490 --> 00:27:36,240
actively participate that matter Alex

549
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:39,010
had pointed out here in the WebRTC

550
00:27:39,010 --> 00:27:41,620
working group there are 88 people

551
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:44,680
registered in the working group but only

552
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:46,330
about 35 show up to the face-to-face

553
00:27:46,330 --> 00:27:49,270
meetings and there really are only 10 to

554
00:27:49,270 --> 00:27:51,880
15 who are actively participating in the

555
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:54,310
decision so those are the people who are

556
00:27:54,310 --> 00:27:56,110
driving what happens and that's the

557
00:27:56,110 --> 00:27:58,270
that's the important point we want to

558
00:27:58,270 --> 00:28:01,180
make today Google Mozilla Microsoft and

559
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:04,889
Apple know best right

560
00:28:04,889 --> 00:28:08,529
well no okay they think they do I can

561
00:28:08,529 --> 00:28:10,179
tell you that for every group that I've

562
00:28:10,179 --> 00:28:12,849
been in that those companies have

563
00:28:12,849 --> 00:28:15,179
participated in and that's everyone I

564
00:28:15,179 --> 00:28:17,919
have heard a statement from each one of

565
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:20,830
them at some point we know what

566
00:28:20,830 --> 00:28:25,749
developers want so trust us if you

567
00:28:25,749 --> 00:28:29,169
disagree at any point then you need to

568
00:28:29,169 --> 00:28:31,119
participate we really need more

569
00:28:31,119 --> 00:28:33,519
developer feedback that's just crucial

570
00:28:33,519 --> 00:28:35,889
in order for this to work out of the 10

571
00:28:35,889 --> 00:28:38,259
to 15 people who are actively working on

572
00:28:38,259 --> 00:28:44,590
web RTC i would say that maybe one isn't

573
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:46,389
developer is an active developer who

574
00:28:46,389 --> 00:28:49,570
does not work for a company that is that

575
00:28:49,570 --> 00:28:52,090
is implementing the specification it's

576
00:28:52,090 --> 00:28:55,359
actually funny to see those four browser

577
00:28:55,359 --> 00:28:57,639
vendors claiming that they know what the

578
00:28:57,639 --> 00:28:59,470
web developer one more than more than

579
00:28:59,470 --> 00:29:01,869
the developer themself especially when

580
00:29:01,869 --> 00:29:04,330
they disagree with each other right when

581
00:29:04,330 --> 00:29:07,059
multi aware especially when google goes

582
00:29:07,059 --> 00:29:09,639
frontal with with Microsoft and start

583
00:29:09,639 --> 00:29:11,379
saying I know what the devs want no I

584
00:29:11,379 --> 00:29:13,929
know what the devs want and they have

585
00:29:13,929 --> 00:29:15,580
different opinion but at the end of the

586
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:17,889
day that's that's really that's really

587
00:29:17,889 --> 00:29:20,799
something we worried about by we I mean

588
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:22,269
the people not working for a browser

589
00:29:22,269 --> 00:29:25,690
vendor is that we lacking enough

590
00:29:25,690 --> 00:29:27,249
feedback from the people that are

591
00:29:27,249 --> 00:29:29,109
actually using the technology and it

592
00:29:29,109 --> 00:29:30,999
should be the first one that matter

593
00:29:30,999 --> 00:29:33,190
which is you and that's really the main

594
00:29:33,190 --> 00:29:35,710
reason why I reach out to Thomas and say

595
00:29:35,710 --> 00:29:37,090
I would like to make that presentation

596
00:29:37,090 --> 00:29:40,059

597
00:29:40,059 --> 00:29:41,919

mean so that's like contributed that the

601
00:29:53,649 --> 00:29:55,929
thing is it's it's actually easy to

603
00:29:57,879 --> 00:30:00,759
mailing list of free the process is easy

604
00:30:00,759 --> 00:30:03,249
the process used to be very complicated

605
00:30:03,249 --> 00:30:05,859
to actually change the specification the

606
00:30:05,859 --> 00:30:07,509
working draft and so on now we're using
