1
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:38,570

and bacon side and so Chris gave me a

2
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:43,329
title about a week ago in fact that was

3
00:00:43,329 --> 00:00:45,320
talk about whatever strikes his fancy

4
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:46,909
and I did consider actually just

5
00:00:46,909 --> 00:00:49,190
bringing like a lego star wars and

6
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:50,479
building it in front of you and and

7
00:00:50,479 --> 00:00:52,579
talking about that but it took me 12

8
00:00:52,579 --> 00:00:53,899
hours to do that over Christmas and I

9
00:00:53,899 --> 00:00:56,479
figured I'd only at 30 minutes so maybe

10
00:00:56,479 --> 00:01:00,369
I should talk about kind of html5 stuff

11
00:01:00,369 --> 00:01:03,289
and I've kind of gone back and forth my

12
00:01:03,289 --> 00:01:05,750
title I realized that that this new

13
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:10,340
title isn't very forthcoming but then

14
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:12,200
the more I kind of ran through my slides

15
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,250
and look at what I wanted to talk about

16
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:15,710
I realized that the point I'm trying to

17
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:18,020
get across is that we're at a point in

18
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:20,690
technology with browsers where we have

19
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:22,600
this web stack where we can actually

20
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:26,119
build anything we want to now a lot of

21
00:01:26,119 --> 00:01:30,110
you in the room I assume are hackers and

22
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:32,030
geeks that when you look at something

23
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:33,440
you have an understanding of how things

24
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:36,200
work and that's what kind of incest what

25
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,539
inspires me to look at you know an

26
00:01:38,539 --> 00:01:39,979
object and say right I've got an

27
00:01:39,979 --> 00:01:41,630
understanding of how that works I can

28
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:43,430
see all the broken down pieces and I

29
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:45,049
know how to build something like that if

30
00:01:45,049 --> 00:01:46,759
I want to go and make it better if it

31
00:01:46,759 --> 00:01:50,210
doesn't exist today I can use that that

32
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:51,950
desire to make something new and better

33
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:53,840
and i think that the technology we have

34
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,390
in browsers today but even years and

35
00:01:56,390 --> 00:01:58,340
years ago allowed us to build anything

36
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:00,560
we want to and i want to talk about i'm

37
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,850
gonna talk about kind of how to get to

38
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:04,520
that but also what you can do in your

39
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,649
website so your web apps today that is

40
00:02:06,649 --> 00:02:08,539
this kind of bleeding edge technology

41
00:02:08,539 --> 00:02:10,039
but you can use it right now today you

42
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:11,510
can go back to your offices and your

43
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:13,160
work and actually go and plug that in

44
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:18,109
and add it in okay so um I'm going to

45
00:02:18,109 --> 00:02:19,970
rewind look we're back and just explain

46
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:21,829
kind of where I'm coming from and I

47
00:02:21,829 --> 00:02:25,850
started I started programming years and

48
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:28,579
years ago but and had a kind of 14k

49
00:02:28,579 --> 00:02:30,799
modem this isn't mine i had a 14k modem

50
00:02:30,799 --> 00:02:34,670
back in the early 90s and connects up

51
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:37,310
over the internet or the internet or

52
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:39,370
whatever the internet was back then and

53
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:41,989
my dad of Sion like hands up who knows

54
00:02:41,989 --> 00:02:46,459
what a sign is one palm pilot newton

55
00:02:46,459 --> 00:02:48,810
anything that old basically old

56
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:52,709
was you loud assets where oldest

57
00:02:52,709 --> 00:02:56,730
okay anyway so I had this thing and make

58
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:58,319
my dad has thing and I wanted to build a

59
00:02:58,319 --> 00:02:59,670
little game for it had this idea and I

60
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:01,620
want to actually write some code that

61
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:04,290
would make a thing on this this piece of

62
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:07,050
technology right so I got my dial-up

63
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:09,510
modem and I connected to bulletin boards

64
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:11,010
or whatever I was connecting to and I

65
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:13,370
downloaded this thing that was an SDK or

66
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:15,330
started downloading this thing it'd take

67
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:17,459
about eight hours of nine hours assuming

68
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:19,110
the connection didn't drop I didn't even

69
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:20,910
know what SDK stood for let alone API or

70
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:22,980
however how any of this actually worked

71
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:26,100
and when I eventually had it down I had

72
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:29,130
this big zip file of stuff that I had no

73
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:30,840
idea what what to do with it so I want

74
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,360
to look to the documentation and it

75
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,459
never happened I mean I I tried out

76
00:03:35,459 --> 00:03:37,200
visual basic at the time and that kind

77
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,110
of got me there but I wasn't really I

78
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:42,450
had that desire and I knew that I should

79
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:44,370
be able to do this but I I couldn't

80
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:45,540
quite get there like I could write

81
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:48,480
programs my spectrum but not for real

82
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:54,030
kind of computers so in 97 I got my

83
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:56,549
first taste of HTML and I foot wrote my

84
00:03:56,549 --> 00:03:59,220
first webpage and I wrote my first nasty

85
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:01,350
piece of JavaScript i wrote i copied and

86
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:03,510
pasted it someone else's code where lo

87
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:04,560
and behold you could roll your mouse

88
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,660
over a text link or is actually an image

89
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:09,299
and swap the image out all right pretty

90
00:04:09,299 --> 00:04:14,790
cool at the time thank you but I also

91
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:16,950
got this you know where to computer fair

92
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:20,100
got a 286 and I had a browser in the 286

93
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:23,430
I discovered javascript and I discovered

94
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:24,960
actually there was a thing called

95
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,470
windows shell scripting host is

96
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:31,350
basically jscript in the machine I could

97
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:34,490
write little programs using HTML and

98
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:38,130
JavaScript that would that would make me

99
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:40,830
that there would run as applications so

100
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:43,889
i discovered that i could write code in

101
00:04:43,889 --> 00:04:46,650
the browser in something like notepad no

102
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:50,280
you know big kind of a IDEs no massive

103
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:52,169
SDK that i had to download the browser

104
00:04:52,169 --> 00:04:53,820
would be on a CD that i can get from a

105
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:55,500
shop and I could use you know Netscape

106
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:58,349
or I could use IE i think it was three

107
00:04:58,349 --> 00:05:02,070
at the time i discovered these things

108
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:02,820
called HTA

109
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:04,770
so I can take a file and change the

110
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:06,840
extension from the HTML and change it to

111
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:09,180
HTA I could double click on it it would

112
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:11,160
run not in the browser but as a little

113
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,290
mini application and I had this idea

114
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:15,150
that I wanted to change my desktop image

115
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:16,980
every now and then automatically rotates

116
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:19,410
it right on windows 95 that didn't exist

117
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:21,840
or they may be a programs but I couldn't

118
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,300
get on the internet to you know this is

119
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:26,250
I only had the internet University not a

120
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:29,160
home like not like today so I made an

121
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:32,040
appt I was able to build something using

122
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:35,510
the web stack over 15 years ago and

123
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:37,740
we're the point today where I think that

124
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:39,060
we should be able to do this completely

125
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:40,410
from beginning to end we should be out

126
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:42,360
of build applications without having to

127
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:45,330
have some objective c wrapper and i

128
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:47,940
don't mean I'm not bad-mouthing phonegap

129
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:51,180
by love phonegap but we should be able

130
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:52,560
to do this with the web stack I mean the

131
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,510
boot to gecko phones that everyone now

132
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:56,970
has is a perfect example of where we

133
00:05:56,970 --> 00:06:05,010
should be in technology today so this is

134
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:08,160
kind of my my path to that that the end

135
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,660
point and there are other pieces to the

136
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:12,930
puzzle but and I imagine that we need

137
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:14,820
some kind of data storage in browsers

138
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:17,930
right we're getting these pieces we need

139
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:20,280
real-time notification whether that's

140
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,080
actually coming from a service or from

141
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,670
the actual application to notify the

142
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:25,560
user that something's happened we want

143
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:28,200
that real-time push notifications we

144
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:30,780
want desktop integration that doesn't

145
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:32,640
mean i don't mean actually kind of

146
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,980
launching from your Start bars or your

147
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:38,340
Applications folder but I mean you can

148
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:39,750
drag a drop into the browser we should

149
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:42,090
be doing this today I spoke to a guy

150
00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:43,860
marketing a couple of days ago and he

151
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:46,500
was saying that I asked him how do you

152
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,630
attach a file to your email if it was on

153
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:50,040
your desktop so he just drags it into

154
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,930
outlook and off he goes so what if

155
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:53,370
you're in gmail how do you attach a file

156
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:55,410
to your email it's like well I click on

157
00:06:55,410 --> 00:06:58,590
browse file and go find the file and now

158
00:06:58,590 --> 00:06:59,790
some why doesn't he dragged into the

159
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:02,010
browser so well because I that's the

160
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:04,890
browser like that's all it is I don't

161
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:07,200
want to leave that page we can do that

162
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,670
today and we should be doing that today

163
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:10,500
and encouraging users to realize that

164
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:13,110
you know the the browser isn't limited

165
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:16,620
by its edges it can bleed out more

166
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:20,760
access to hardware and that's coming we

167
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:23,250
want I want to be installed locally to

168
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:24,419
the machine I want to be able to give

169
00:07:24,419 --> 00:07:27,810
you a USB stick with something like Jace

170
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:29,760
pin which I've written put it on a USB

171
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,260
stick and you can have that installed on

172
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:32,490
your machine whether or not you're

173
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:34,590
running Windows we're not you're running

174
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:36,270
a mac or linux or whatever whether your

175
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:37,710
favorite browsers firefox or if your

176
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:41,550
favorite browser is cream and eventually

177
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:44,010
i want to get completely naked not like

178
00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:46,919
that but and i want to get rid of the

179
00:07:46,919 --> 00:07:49,620
browser Chrome I don't want to have the

180
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:51,060
edges of the browser's I want this to be

181
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:54,210
fully bedded into or give the user the

182
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:56,070
appearance that it's fully better than

183
00:07:56,070 --> 00:08:06,120
its the operating system okay I mean

184
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,260
overrun if I keep showing you that by

185
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:10,710
the way so these are a few things that I

186
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:14,580
wanted to go through that make your that

187
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:15,750
you should be putting into your websites

188
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:20,430
today if you support and it's very

189
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:22,080
likely you support IE seven eight nine

190
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,639
whatever you've got there's these

191
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:25,620
browsers that have limited technology

192
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:27,570
support this is progressive enhancement

193
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:30,419
or most of it is the point is everything

194
00:08:30,419 --> 00:08:32,580
I talked about in this section you will

195
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:34,890
benefit from it if you include and it

196
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:36,750
will not affect your application if the

197
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:38,610
browser doesn't have it natively okay

198
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:40,140
the first one's the most obvious one

199
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:42,390
have yourself some html5 goodness okay

200
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:44,339
just stick the doctype if anyone's not

201
00:08:44,339 --> 00:08:46,230
using this doctype already go back to

202
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:49,560
work delete the XHTML 1.1 doctype you

203
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,959
have put that in your paste of validates

204
00:08:51,959 --> 00:08:53,550
and you've saved yourself some bites

205
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:56,010
over the wire your sis admin guy or go

206
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:58,890
is happy as hell are they not saving

207
00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:00,930
that much but use that today another

208
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:03,209
really simple thing is hopefully know is

209
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:05,670
anyone using kind of XML parsing and you

210
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:06,660
pretty don't want to be a hand up

211
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:09,660
because you might get here yeah I was

212
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:11,190
working on an application recently where

213
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:12,630
we were actually passing XML from the

214
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:14,670
server back into the client it there's

215
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:16,380
no point in doing this we've got native

216
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:19,410
JSON parsing inside of the browser okay

217
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:21,900
hopefully everyone's aware this web

218
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:24,240
storage which that there's no reason to

219
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,100
use cookies in a lot of situations

220
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:29,310
cookies have their place but web storage

221
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:30,150
is the solution

222
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:32,340
cookies the solution to the limitations

223
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:34,770
we have inside of cookies the 64k limit

224
00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:37,770
or the 128 cookies that you can have in

225
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:40,380
ie7 or whatever the actual number is and

226
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:42,870
the API is the specifications written in

227
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:46,020
a way that you can treat session storage

228
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:47,250
your local stores is a first-class

229
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:49,860
objects inside of your browser you don't

230
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:51,840
have to do set ice and remove get item

231
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,940
and remove item you can just treat it as

232
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:55,260
a regular object has some kind of

233
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:58,320
persistence inside of it so the API

234
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,900
defines get set and remove item as

235
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:04,830
guetta setters removers or delices there

236
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:07,470
has been recent discussion about the

237
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:11,310
performance of local storage there's no

238
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:14,090
discussion of session storage in that

239
00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:17,760
that performance conversation and

240
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,160
basically Christic quite a detailed post

241
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,810
on the the hacks Mozilla website

242
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:26,310
recently and he opens with we have to

243
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:28,620
stop outer casing local storage I don't

244
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:31,080
agree with this personally but it makes

245
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:33,390
a bunch of in a decent points if you're

246
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:36,240
sticking a two and a half Meg file or

247
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,060
you know base encoding into local

248
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:40,470
storage it will be slow to come back out

249
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:42,750
again and it's a synchronous API you

250
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:45,720
should be treating local storage like a

251
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,880
cookie cookie killer okay it's a

252
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,710
replacement for cookies not a

253
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:53,310
replacement for app cache so be sensible

254
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:56,190
about your your web storage ease but the

255
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:57,570
thing I think is really important about

256
00:10:57,570 --> 00:10:59,940
web storage that we and the reason why

257
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:01,370
we shouldn't get rid of it is actually

258
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:05,010
web storage has events so as i type in

259
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:07,470
this window that date is being

260
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:09,300
synchronized every other window via a

261
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:13,230
storage event so i just listen for the

262
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:14,570
storage event and i run my callback

263
00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:17,990
think about the people who are using

264
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:21,360
HTML presentation software they could

265
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,750
have two separate windows up one with

266
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:26,610
the presentation the presentation view

267
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:28,380
where I have some notes I have the

268
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:30,480
upcoming slide I have a timer and one

269
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,070
that shows you the actual you know the

270
00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:35,390
slides for you guys as I move forward on

271
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:38,460
this window I press you know impress my

272
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:41,130
clicker it sends the the forward key it

273
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:43,230
moves forward but it stores the slide

274
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:43,950
that I'm currently

275
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:46,620
on which triggers an event on my main

276
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:47,940
window that pushes the whole thing

277
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:50,100
forward ok I've got synchronization

278
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:52,080
across windows via those storage events

279
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:54,240
which is baked into web storage which is

280
00:11:54,240 --> 00:12:00,000
in ie8 ok so web forms where form of

281
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,680
support is really not not as good as it

282
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:07,560
should be in my opinion but you have

283
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,060
problems like this I was googling for

284
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:13,020
the for the regex for a valid email

285
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:14,340
address right and I started off with

286
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:16,800
this and then it carried on getting

287
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,240
longer and longer and longer until you

288
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,960
got something like that right the reason

289
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:24,270
for it is that those that list that's a

290
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:26,940
list of valid email addresses if I was

291
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:28,650
writing a regex there's no way that I

292
00:12:28,650 --> 00:12:30,510
catch the one that's double quotes at

293
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:35,490
example org and the thing is with client

294
00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:36,660
side validation you have to do on the

295
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:38,970
server side anyway so just use input

296
00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:41,460
type equals email you should go back any

297
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:43,680
registration form you have now use that

298
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,810
you get your free validation you still

299
00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:47,430
have to double up your validation on the

300
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:49,560
server side we don't have to have your

301
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,390
JavaScript guy right though regex on

302
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:53,520
this client side and your Python guy

303
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:55,920
right the server side regex I mean maybe

304
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,860
you're sharing the regex which is great

305
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:00,330
but this is free validation make use of

306
00:13:00,330 --> 00:13:02,580
it is baked into the browser's it's it's

307
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:04,920
in a lot of the latest browsing the ones

308
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:07,050
that don't have it so I ate it doesn't

309
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:08,640
have it all it will do is hit your

310
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:09,960
server and say it's not a valid email

311
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,760
address and come back because it's got

312
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,110
to work without javascript in the first

313
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:18,930
place right so the history API is a

314
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:22,590
really awesome API for fixing that tiny

315
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:24,510
little arrow at the top of our browsers

316
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:28,740
Ajax came along and we kind of well I

317
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:32,700
certainly went oh this is awesome and

318
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:34,770
then I produced a lot of websites that

319
00:13:34,770 --> 00:13:36,750
didn't work properly anymore the back

320
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:38,790
button was completely broken I was

321
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:41,310
basically replicating what I was I was

322
00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:43,650
looking at flash websites and going well

323
00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:45,390
the back buttons broken you can't

324
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:47,340
permalink any other content you know

325
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:49,470
they completely broken accessibility but

326
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:52,770
look at my ajax solution right same

327
00:13:52,770 --> 00:13:55,470
problem I was reinventing their their

328
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:57,480
their issues but the history API give

329
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:59,600
me that that last piece of the puzzle I

330
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,430
assume most of you already seen this on

331
00:14:02,430 --> 00:14:04,949
on github but as I'm navigating back and

332
00:14:04,949 --> 00:14:07,829
forth between the files the URL at the

333
00:14:07,829 --> 00:14:09,600
top is updating that's the important

334
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,360
part this application works without

335
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,940
history API their progressive enhancing

336
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:16,769
their making the experience slightly

337
00:14:16,769 --> 00:14:19,560
better by not reloading the entire page

338
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:21,660
or just Ajax loading in the little part

339
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:25,170
of the web page then they want but most

340
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:27,449
importantly the URL actually updates and

341
00:14:27,449 --> 00:14:29,220
represents where I really am and if I

342
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:31,680
navigate just to you know the code view

343
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:35,339
it actually works this is the basic part

344
00:14:35,339 --> 00:14:37,139
you know that there's the moat this

345
00:14:37,139 --> 00:14:38,399
progress enhancement in its most basic

346
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:42,870
form detect sorry build an on JavaScript

347
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:44,550
version or build the version for your

348
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:48,600
lowest common denominator detective the

349
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,579
history push state support is there in

350
00:14:50,579 --> 00:14:53,310
the first place progressively enhance

351
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:55,110
you might want to use history jes

352
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:57,449
instead instead of actually the the push

353
00:14:57,449 --> 00:15:00,779
state because the support in what older

354
00:15:00,779 --> 00:15:02,760
versions of iOS isn't that great not a

355
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:06,240
great scrap but yeah go pace yourself on

356
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,860
the back and have a tea or you guys have

357
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:13,139
Cote right yeah right a coffee yeah have

358
00:15:13,139 --> 00:15:20,889
a coffee several copies so this is a

359
00:15:20,899 --> 00:15:23,940
this is a little bit controversial and

360
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:26,910
you probably is controversial but I'll

361
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:30,029
explain why you should be able to use

362
00:15:30,029 --> 00:15:33,350
the app cache the offline API for

363
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:37,170
caching specific assets not specifically

364
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:38,670
to make the whole thing work offline but

365
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:40,110
to take a large part your application

366
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:41,399
and drop that into the app cache and

367
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:46,260
make use of that now the counter

368
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:48,779
argument for doing that i was talking to

369
00:15:48,779 --> 00:15:50,910
jake yesterday who's going to be talking

370
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:54,690
about this as well in detail rather in

371
00:15:54,690 --> 00:15:56,959
hixson who did the wrote the html5

372
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:59,639
specification the reason he says not to

373
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:02,690
do this is because the browsers have

374
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:04,920
caches and already you're basically

375
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:07,079
reinvent your you're exploiting a

376
00:16:07,079 --> 00:16:08,430
feature of the app cache you shouldn't

377
00:16:08,430 --> 00:16:10,649
be using that the browser should be

378
00:16:10,649 --> 00:16:10,950
doing

379
00:16:10,950 --> 00:16:15,300
caching job for you but if you come to

380
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:17,340
my application I give you my 200k

381
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:19,620
uncompressed javascript file and then

382
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:22,110
you go to another website and it loads

383
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:23,460
enough JavaScript that eventually just

384
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:25,920
pushes my 200k out when you are back to

385
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,680
my website on my app that's no longer in

386
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:31,800
the cash app cache allows us to say for

387
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:34,350
this specific domain for this URL Jay

388
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:36,900
has been I want you to store this file

389
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:38,940
this specific file and I want to make

390
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:42,510
sure that's always in the cache so it is

391
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:43,650
actually better than the browser's

392
00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:45,480
default cash because we're being

393
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:49,100
explicit about what we want it to store

394
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:51,450
Steve Souders good performance guy to

395
00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:55,650
back up my point I guess he said at the

396
00:16:55,650 --> 00:16:58,050
breaking development conference in

397
00:16:58,050 --> 00:17:00,240
September last year you might as well

398
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,910
use it for offline performance there is

399
00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:08,610
a caveat the caveat is I'm not spoiling

400
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:10,620
Jake's talk by the way as much as might

401
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:13,320
throw a second me a minute yep the

402
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:15,780
caveat is this performance benefit only

403
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:18,600
kicks in if it is in app cache mode so

404
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:20,490
if you're on a page that hasn't had

405
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:22,370
hasn't used the app cache at all I

406
00:17:22,370 --> 00:17:24,930
realized about 20 minutes ago that it

407
00:17:24,930 --> 00:17:27,660
doesn't actually engage the assets that

408
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:30,030
are locally stored so you need to make

409
00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:31,590
sure that the manifest is being

410
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:35,910
triggered on your whole application Jake

411
00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:39,090
will go through more detail tomorrow and

412
00:17:39,090 --> 00:17:40,290
if you're lucky he will pull off this

413
00:17:40,290 --> 00:17:47,670
move for you as well okay so websockets

414
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:49,470
to me are extremely sexy i don't know

415
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:51,540
how technology became sexy but web

416
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:54,150
sockets very sexy eventsource is kind of

417
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:56,730
like the ugly brother and but it's

418
00:17:56,730 --> 00:17:58,710
really cool when you get to know it's

419
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:02,360
like you see past the ugliness

420
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:04,500
eventsource if you don't know is basic

421
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,990
real-time events from the server to the

422
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:09,470
client side and but what's really

423
00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:11,760
important about eventsource over web

424
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:16,110
sockets is that it runs over HTTP so it

425
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:18,630
means that if you have a piece of

426
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:20,760
technology like an android that doesn't

427
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,350
have flash support so you can't polyfill

428
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:24,300
web sockets you can replicate the

429
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:27,170
whole event source API using javascript

430
00:18:27,170 --> 00:18:32,250
now what I've just done here is I work

431
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:33,690
with the Android Manhattan I had a

432
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:34,830
debugger I don't know how to open up

433
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:36,870
console I know there's some weird you

434
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:38,970
know I don't know cheat code to get it

435
00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:41,340
to work but basically what I did is I

436
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:42,930
took a little app that I've written

437
00:18:42,930 --> 00:18:45,600
myself for workshops Jess console and I

438
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,000
just said when you type in this listen

439
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,170
command open up or start sending every

440
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:54,540
message i right in my desktop window up

441
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:57,030
to the server and if there is a script

442
00:18:57,030 --> 00:18:59,130
tag that matches that listen command in

443
00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:01,830
a mobile device like my android here

444
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:04,020
it'll connect up on my server and just

445
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:06,360
push the messages back and forth between

446
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:08,550
three devices so the console that logs

447
00:19:08,550 --> 00:19:10,620
on my phone come out on my desktop and

448
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:13,200
all the commands I run on my desktop go

449
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,200
out on my phone but because there's no

450
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:19,710
web sockets on Android or Android 22 or

451
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:21,450
21 or whatever this was at the time and

452
00:19:21,450 --> 00:19:23,250
because there was no flash there I

453
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:25,770
couldn't polyfill the web socket so I

454
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:28,320
had to use JavaScript to do this and I'm

455
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,910
using a vent source which means that if

456
00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:31,440
a scent event sources their native lip

457
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,600
it works out the box if it's not it's

458
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,450
using the polyfill which gives me all of

459
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:39,450
the the real time eventsource attributes

460
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:43,740
and my code works right on an old phone

461
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:46,350
oh it's not that old but a phone that

462
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:47,970
didn't have the technology natively and

463
00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:49,980
I've got real-time events in my browser

464
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:52,980
I should say I see a lot of examples of

465
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:55,800
people using web sockets for things that

466
00:19:55,800 --> 00:20:00,060
are just pure push-based messages to the

467
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:02,790
to the browser things like prices things

468
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:04,260
like real time charts things like ripped

469
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:07,860
on news really that problem is better

470
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:10,620
suited to event source but if you want

471
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:12,210
to go cross origin then you've got a

472
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:13,980
whole different problem but I'm only

473
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:15,390
talking about what you could do today so

474
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:21,270
this technology you can use today this I

475
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:23,340
this is something that I think we should

476
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:25,230
definitely if anyone had is it just a

477
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:26,730
hat show of hands anyone on their

478
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:28,260
website any website they've used before

479
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:31,640
got like input type file for anything

480
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:33,330
wouldn't it be cool if you could just

481
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:35,430
drag into the browser and drop and off

482
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:39,230
you go browsers support that

483
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:42,360
this is me trying to post a tweet of a

484
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:44,430
with a screenshot right I drag it into

485
00:20:44,430 --> 00:20:48,630
Twitter and I get to see the picture I'm

486
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:50,940
now lost the tweet if Twitter's here

487
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:54,300
here's some free code and you may not be

488
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:58,170
here what I well what I want to do is is

489
00:20:58,170 --> 00:21:00,270
dragged into the browser and it reads

490
00:21:00,270 --> 00:21:03,000
the file right and something in chrome

491
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,180
and I think Firefox supports as well if

492
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:08,670
you drop the file onto the browse button

493
00:21:08,670 --> 00:21:11,100
you know the file input has browse next

494
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:13,680
to it you drop your file onto that it

495
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:16,170
will actually read it and by fluke I

496
00:21:16,170 --> 00:21:17,370
discovered that I could drop it onto

497
00:21:17,370 --> 00:21:20,640
that tiny little icon because that tiny

498
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,080
little icon is actually sitting on top

499
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,120
of the Browse button and it works but

500
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:28,320
it's a tiny hit target right this is the

501
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:31,380
code that fixes this I mean it's been

502
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:33,960
its generic but it fixes it the first

503
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,640
thing I do is I set up a drop handler or

504
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:38,220
I set up a drop function that will only

505
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:40,620
get attached under a specific condition

506
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:42,900
and it says prevent the drop from

507
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:45,360
happening the drag-and-drop API is

508
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,070
completely backward if you've ever read

509
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:48,810
PP case blog post then you will learn a

510
00:21:48,810 --> 00:21:52,260
lot of swear words it's it's about drag

511
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:55,440
and drop its superb but it's an awful

512
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,200
API you have to cancel the event that

513
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,390
says he just drops and the reason you

514
00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:01,470
have to do that is to stop the browser

515
00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:03,900
from redirecting off to that that target

516
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:06,420
file and then I read the files that are

517
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:08,550
inside of the data transfer files you

518
00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:10,530
could support you could check whether

519
00:22:10,530 --> 00:22:12,030
this is ported if it's not don't do

520
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:14,940
anything about it I'm hooking this on

521
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:16,920
the root element so the HTML element

522
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,480
right at the top I'm saying if you drag

523
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:21,810
anywhere into that that window it will

524
00:22:21,810 --> 00:22:23,940
pick up that drag-and-drop event you can

525
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:25,710
do maybe Twitter adjuster on the actual

526
00:22:25,710 --> 00:22:28,650
tweet window right I'm saying if I drag

527
00:22:28,650 --> 00:22:31,560
over that element then go and listen for

528
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:36,000
the drop event so this drop event isn't

529
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,710
always listening in the first place only

530
00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:39,420
if you drop if you drag over a specific

531
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:42,240
element or you could make this generic

532
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:45,780
but even less generic rather and then

533
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:47,580
anyway when I drag when I end the drag

534
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:51,210
event it removes the drop handler

535
00:22:51,210 --> 00:22:52,950
and then I'm sure Twitter would add if

536
00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:54,720
we've actually dropped inside of the at

537
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,130
the you know the element has a tweet

538
00:22:56,130 --> 00:22:57,720
check that I'm inside this element and

539
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,940
then read the files put it into the

540
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:01,799
browser and now the experience is just

541
00:23:01,799 --> 00:23:03,750
that little bit better and it still

542
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:05,640
works in IE a or any browser that

543
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,529
doesn't support actually IE does support

544
00:23:07,529 --> 00:23:10,320
drag-and-drop which is insane but they

545
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,669
don't have the file API so there won't

546
00:23:11,669 --> 00:23:14,700
be a complete this transaction but this

547
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:16,770
whole experience still works we've just

548
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:18,120
made it better in a bunch of Oliver

549
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,679
Brown browses some future proofed it

550
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:22,620
right it's we need to teach users that

551
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:25,080
the browser isn't just we don't we're

552
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:26,940
not limited to those you know for ages

553
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:32,100
basically so that's my a few things I

554
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:33,840
hope people go back and actually add to

555
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:37,380
the websites quick smart like soonish

556
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:40,230
and I want to touch on like the the bits

557
00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:43,020
that are nearby the hardware access

558
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:44,279
being able to get real-time

559
00:23:44,279 --> 00:23:47,039
communication one of the things that

560
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:49,770
when I've given kind of html5 workshops

561
00:23:49,770 --> 00:23:51,690
comes up every single time how do I get

562
00:23:51,690 --> 00:23:53,100
to the webcam and how do I get to the

563
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:55,799
microphone well there's now an API that

564
00:23:55,799 --> 00:23:59,549
gives us that this is just a video

565
00:23:59,549 --> 00:24:02,520
element that is listening to the webcam

566
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:06,710
it works in opera mobile and it works in

567
00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:10,200
canary and you do have to enable it I

568
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:13,559
know he's pretty good-looking as me but

569
00:24:13,559 --> 00:24:15,690
the codes relatively sure all I do is I

570
00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:17,669
say get this user media I give it

571
00:24:17,669 --> 00:24:20,460
specific arguments that are the audio in

572
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:23,039
the video it gives me a call back that

573
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:25,260
has the stream I Jeff I point my video

574
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:27,179
element to that stream as a few hoops

575
00:24:27,179 --> 00:24:28,799
you have to jump through and web key at

576
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:30,330
the moment where you need to create an

577
00:24:30,330 --> 00:24:32,250
object URL but this is how the codes

578
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:34,200
supposed to work to get access to these

579
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:37,679
pieces of hardware this is a screenshot

580
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:40,169
of a opera mobile I was amazed this

581
00:24:40,169 --> 00:24:41,700
doesn't work I didn't think I thought

582
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:43,919
this was in labs not in production build

583
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:45,330
of opera mobile they have the advantage

584
00:24:45,330 --> 00:24:47,970
it's not baked into the operating system

585
00:24:47,970 --> 00:24:50,250
like Safari is a slow updating browser

586
00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:53,760
because you have to get the whole OS but

587
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,100
it's still quite early you can't get the

588
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:58,620
audio stream working it's just it's not

589
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:00,480
in canary working properly at the moment

590
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:03,240
it's not in Opera Mobile they're adding

591
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:05,080
it I posted this

592
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:09,250
and and then Rick basically said yeah it

593
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:11,860
does work wherever rick is I saw his

594
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:15,910
hair somewhere evident there we go there

595
00:25:15,910 --> 00:25:17,320
is a way of getting the audio stream

596
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:18,730
there isn't it there's a connection

597
00:25:18,730 --> 00:25:21,040
Pierre a peer connection API which does

598
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:25,150
actually work so I've got a few minutes

599
00:25:25,150 --> 00:25:28,390
left a challenge for you if you were if

600
00:25:28,390 --> 00:25:30,430
you want it this is the screensaver that

601
00:25:30,430 --> 00:25:35,920
I use and the way it works it's not it's

602
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:40,630
it's a you know its native native app it

603
00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:42,220
fires around these particles in the page

604
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:43,960
and you know it looks pretty but these

605
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:47,650
this reacts to sound so if there's

606
00:25:47,650 --> 00:25:50,200
ambient noise around my laptop it'll you

607
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,820
know make these kind of starbursts which

608
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:56,200
should pretty make me happy this is web

609
00:25:56,200 --> 00:26:00,610
RTC reading the audio stream then we've

610
00:26:00,610 --> 00:26:02,860
got a processing of that audio stream

611
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:05,620
and visualization of that using WebGL or

612
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:07,690
the 2d API and then we've got the full

613
00:26:07,690 --> 00:26:09,910
screen API these are in these are in

614
00:26:09,910 --> 00:26:11,860
browsers today they may be bleeding at

615
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:14,590
browsers but we can do this today and in

616
00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:16,450
theory you should be able to do on your

617
00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:18,370
mobile phones I heard Brendan was

618
00:26:18,370 --> 00:26:20,760
looking for a decent like startup screen

619
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:24,250
you could do this in theory these are

620
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:30,170
all open api's so someone build that

621
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:35,560
thank you the last part going chrome is

622
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:40,150
going naked and I realized that like we

623
00:26:40,150 --> 00:26:42,190
have this full screen API and which I

624
00:26:42,190 --> 00:26:43,570
haven't talked about at all but there's

625
00:26:43,570 --> 00:26:45,820
an API that allows you to make any part

626
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:47,320
of a web page full screen which is great

627
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:49,540
but now we want to be able to get to

628
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:51,820
being in a strip away the whole or I

629
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:53,200
want to get to be at a strip away the

630
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,240
whole of the whole of the browser chrome

631
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:57,940
and i'm not talking about headless i got

632
00:26:57,940 --> 00:26:59,050
a lot of people saying oh you want

633
00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:00,730
phantom j/s i'm not talking about

634
00:27:00,730 --> 00:27:02,020
headless browse the one that doesn't

635
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:05,650
that runs without any view i'm not just

636
00:27:05,650 --> 00:27:08,320
talking about full screen I want it to

637
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:12,520
be a web app that uses web technology

638
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:18,280
that a basic iTunes is a web app a whole

639
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:19,049
of itunes

640
00:27:19,049 --> 00:27:21,570
just WebKit the whole of I to the apple

641
00:27:21,570 --> 00:27:25,019
store on iphone is WebKit the only

642
00:27:25,019 --> 00:27:26,669
reason we're aware of that is because it

643
00:27:26,669 --> 00:27:27,989
broke one day and there was a whole

644
00:27:27,989 --> 00:27:29,429
bunch of broken images inside of it and

645
00:27:29,429 --> 00:27:32,700
a lack of CSS it feels native right I've

646
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:36,899
got friends in bryson who will anyway he

647
00:27:36,899 --> 00:27:39,119
goes on about UX all the time and how

648
00:27:39,119 --> 00:27:41,009
nate is so much better than web because

649
00:27:41,009 --> 00:27:42,539
we can't get that performance but if we

650
00:27:42,539 --> 00:27:44,820
have an iphone app that feels like its

651
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:46,139
native and the only reason we realized

652
00:27:46,139 --> 00:27:49,049
it wasn't was because it broke it's

653
00:27:49,049 --> 00:27:50,940
possible it's not that the technology is

654
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:53,519
lacking it's the the actual quality of

655
00:27:53,519 --> 00:27:56,190
the design and the UX and so on anyway

656
00:27:56,190 --> 00:27:58,679
so IE still has this HTA technology i

657
00:27:58,679 --> 00:28:01,559
looked at it windows 8 has it I double

658
00:28:01,559 --> 00:28:02,909
clicked on the file looks at user agent

659
00:28:02,909 --> 00:28:05,940
string and it is IE 7 I had no idea how

660
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:08,009
to get hold of ie7 inside a Windows 8

661
00:28:08,009 --> 00:28:10,649
this is a way of doing it so that's not

662
00:28:10,649 --> 00:28:18,359
viable at all a chrome has the spanner

663
00:28:18,359 --> 00:28:20,399
tools and you have this great shortcut

664
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:23,700
so if anyone's using a pc or Linux you

665
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:25,859
can create a shortcut to the application

666
00:28:25,859 --> 00:28:28,769
you get an icon in like your desktop or

667
00:28:28,769 --> 00:28:30,840
your your start bar and you can double

668
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:33,090
click on it it runs as a little app

669
00:28:33,090 --> 00:28:35,129
basically it's full web but you just

670
00:28:35,129 --> 00:28:36,559
don't have the browser chrome around it

671
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:39,570
that's pretty close except it doesn't

672
00:28:39,570 --> 00:28:41,249
walk on a Mac and I can see a couple of

673
00:28:41,249 --> 00:28:43,919
max around we as developers tend to use

674
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:46,320
them for whatever reason that there is a

675
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,749
really detailed post about why it

676
00:28:48,749 --> 00:28:50,940
doesn't work on Mac and what's required

677
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:53,909
to do it which I think it's not case if

678
00:28:53,909 --> 00:28:56,609
they're not doing it it's it's a hard

679
00:28:56,609 --> 00:28:57,989
problem to solve when they're trying to

680
00:28:57,989 --> 00:29:00,480
plan it out carefully there's also the

681
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:03,239
question of Chrome or Google have an

682
00:29:03,239 --> 00:29:06,749
interest in the Chrome OS which doesn't

683
00:29:06,749 --> 00:29:07,980
have applications it's just the browser

684
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:10,859
so why would they allow for you know a

685
00:29:10,859 --> 00:29:13,529
full application you know maybe there's

686
00:29:13,529 --> 00:29:16,710
some conflicts of interest there but

687
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:18,389
this isn't good enough it's hidden away

688
00:29:18,389 --> 00:29:20,519
inside of the spanner tools create

689
00:29:20,519 --> 00:29:23,309
application that needs to be much more

690
00:29:23,309 --> 00:29:26,730
exposed Opera have these w3c widgets

691
00:29:26,730 --> 00:29:29,810
which are actually really close it's

692
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:31,370
/ zip file that has a bunch of assets

693
00:29:31,370 --> 00:29:33,320
inside of it I am almost done by the way

694
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:35,810
sorry a bunch of assets inside of it a

695
00:29:35,810 --> 00:29:40,160
config icons favicons you double click

696
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:42,230
on it you can get you know your full

697
00:29:42,230 --> 00:29:44,270
view you can have transparency in the

698
00:29:44,270 --> 00:29:46,520
window zhe doesn't have to be a you know

699
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:48,440
square window can be round like you know

700
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:50,360
some of the air applications were but

701
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:52,430
for whatever reason none of the browser

702
00:29:52,430 --> 00:29:53,870
seem to be picking up this specification

703
00:29:53,870 --> 00:29:56,720
is a part of the w3c the other browsers

704
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:59,090
haven't implemented this asshole I don't

705
00:29:59,090 --> 00:30:01,010
know why it seems to be very close I

706
00:30:01,010 --> 00:30:02,510
don't think the language is right I

707
00:30:02,510 --> 00:30:04,880
don't think we should be using XML for

708
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:13,370
our apps yeah Mozilla have a very early

709
00:30:13,370 --> 00:30:16,850
draft of a spec called web RT which

710
00:30:16,850 --> 00:30:20,720
looks possibly promising it's a manifest

711
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,880
file that describes the application

712
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:25,280
describes the launch path describes the

713
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,450
permissions that the application should

714
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:29,900
have and it's it since if you look at

715
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:31,310
Firefox now actually you can see

716
00:30:31,310 --> 00:30:34,340
navigator dot web Mars apps install and

717
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:37,160
you can give it the URL to the manifest

718
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:39,500
and I think of some options and a

719
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:41,330
callback for success or failure and you

720
00:30:41,330 --> 00:30:42,590
can actually trigger an install of an

721
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:45,200
application this is for their web store

722
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:49,070
but this is apps being installed this is

723
00:30:49,070 --> 00:30:52,430
from Robert nylons talk a little while

724
00:30:52,430 --> 00:30:54,020
ago some links not post the slides and

725
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:56,600
so on but it's an example of a manifest

726
00:30:56,600 --> 00:31:00,740
a web app manifest and that's fairly

727
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:02,510
descriptive that tells me i think

728
00:31:02,510 --> 00:31:04,070
there's also a permissions section that

729
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:07,760
I've admitted that would say these are

730
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,620
going to have so much disk space access

731
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:12,020
it's going to work offline and we can

732
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:14,690
use the standard web technology that we

733
00:31:14,690 --> 00:31:18,020
used to using what I want to see is dot

734
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:20,840
web app files that I could give to you

735
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:22,670
and if your favorite browser is Firefox

736
00:31:22,670 --> 00:31:25,970
excellent if mine is opera or and yours

737
00:31:25,970 --> 00:31:27,500
is chrome then I should be able to

738
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:29,210
double click this file and it will pull

739
00:31:29,210 --> 00:31:31,880
up the viewport the North you put the

740
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:34,430
rendered view and that's the application

741
00:31:34,430 --> 00:31:37,160
and I have access to the same access as

742
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:38,870
if it were a browser but I can make it

743
00:31:38,870 --> 00:31:42,530
work offline I have this web app

744
00:31:42,530 --> 00:31:43,509
technology

745
00:31:43,509 --> 00:31:46,309
so for me the interest or whether the

746
00:31:46,309 --> 00:31:48,799
discussion isn't really about html5 I

747
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:50,600
mean some of the tech I mentioned is

748
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:52,789
html5 some of it isn't the most

749
00:31:52,789 --> 00:31:54,679
interesting part is the JavaScript part

750
00:31:54,679 --> 00:31:58,700
i want that language to make easy to

751
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:00,379
build applications i want to be able to

752
00:32:00,379 --> 00:32:06,019
build anything so that's me i think

753
00:32:06,019 --> 00:32:07,970
there's a break going on right now if

754
00:32:07,970 --> 00:32:10,129
you want to ask me questions you can or

755
00:32:10,129 --> 00:32:11,570
you can come up during a break and

756
00:32:11,570 --> 00:32:13,700
bother me bring beer that makes me

757
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:15,879
answer them much much easier so thanks
