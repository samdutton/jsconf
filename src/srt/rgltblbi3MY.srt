2
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:11,010
thank you and yeah it's nice to see all

3
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:13,049
of you here to want to listen to my

4
00:00:13,049 --> 00:00:17,520
story about gratitude and I'm gonna tell

5
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,760
you about a day and evening in July 2015

6
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:24,119
that changed my perspective of Who I am

7
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:26,880
and what I'm gonna be and I'm still very

8
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,429
very grateful for that moment but the

9
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:31,619
story starts a little bit earlier about

10
00:00:31,619 --> 00:00:34,380
six months earlier when I came to Berlin

11
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:37,440
as a biologist to start a PhD on

12
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,829
honeybees and I stayed there for three

13
00:00:40,829 --> 00:00:43,710
months notice academia really wasn't the

14
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:44,460
place for me

15
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:47,039
and I decided to become a developer so I

16
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:49,079
learned how to code I wrote lots and

17
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:51,210
lots of applications and three months

18
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:53,340
later I actually had my first developer

19
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:56,489
job so then that was awesome right but

20
00:00:56,489 --> 00:00:58,980
it was also super scary you go in there

21
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:01,230
you don't know anything and right there

22
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:04,019
was so much stuff than over my hat but

23
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:06,270
also in my first days on that job

24
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:08,520
something really weird happened to me

25
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:11,430
suddenly I was introduced everywhere as

26
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:14,909
the female developer and I never

27
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:16,439
considered myself female I was just

28
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:20,009
sissy I never thought about this and it

29
00:01:20,009 --> 00:01:22,049
kept on happening like I I was lucky my

30
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:23,700
team was really nice they were trying to

31
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:25,740
make me feel good and they were teaching

32
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:27,780
me a lot of things but I was constantly

33
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:31,049
the only woman in the room and I didn't

34
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:33,329
even notice but it it was just straining

35
00:01:33,329 --> 00:01:36,659
so now we come to delight three months

36
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:39,270
later I still come home really tired

37
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:40,890
because of all the stuff that I learned

38
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:43,290
every day right but also because of this

39
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:46,079
weird feeling of not fitting in like

40
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:47,820
everybody is kind of speaking a

41
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:50,280
different language from me and so I'm

42
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,320
new to Berlin so I go to meetups to meet

43
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,570
people and one of these meetups that I

44
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:57,600
found was women who code Berlin and on

45
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,070
that night it was the very first meetup

46
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:00,780
I didn't expect anything one of my first

47
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:03,689
tech meetups and I walk into a room and

48
00:02:03,689 --> 00:02:06,750
this room in this room they are like 50

49
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:09,750
female developers and I almost cried it

50
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:13,650
like I still can't describe the feeling

51
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:15,900
and yeah all I can say like sometimes

52
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:17,610
you have to go away to notice your home

53
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:20,879
it like the way these meetups work is

54
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:22,680
they have a couple of talks and a lot of

55
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,299
community time it's open to everybody

56
00:02:24,299 --> 00:02:26,909
also males can attend only people who

57
00:02:26,909 --> 00:02:28,530
consider themselves female can speak and

58
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:31,290
all the technical to like it's over all

59
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:33,239
languages all topics so the technical

60
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:35,099
talks totally went over my hat I didn't

61
00:02:35,099 --> 00:02:37,140
understand anything but the thing that I

62
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:39,510
really remember is the amazing Alexander

63
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:40,739
like a veal Oscar she's one of the

64
00:02:40,739 --> 00:02:42,930
organizers and as senior iOS developer

65
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:45,360
at SoundCloud and she gave a talk about

66
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,340
something iOS II I didn't understand at

67
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:49,560
all but seeing her up on stage there

68
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,750
showed me that these people who are

69
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:53,700
somewhat like me who can be coding

70
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:56,129
rockstars and that was the first moment

71
00:02:56,129 --> 00:02:57,720
where I actually felt like I could

72
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,579
belong into this industry that there

73
00:02:59,579 --> 00:03:01,590
could be a place for me in there and

74
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:04,440
this really has opened up for me the

75
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:07,409
opportunity to go to a lot of other

76
00:03:07,409 --> 00:03:09,870
meetups and now I'm this is four years

77
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:11,730
ago right so now I speak at a lot of

78
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:13,950
meters I tutor I there's a lot of

79
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:16,349
communities that I can call home now but

80
00:03:16,349 --> 00:03:18,299
it all started on that that evening and

81
00:03:18,299 --> 00:03:20,340
I'm super super grateful for that so

82
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:21,570
thank you

83
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:26,200
[Applause]
