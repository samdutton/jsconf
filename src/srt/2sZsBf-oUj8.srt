1
00:00:20,869 --> 00:00:27,900
My name is Sarah Meyer, and I am
a web developer from New York, specifically

2
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:32,980
Brooklyn,
home of -- yeah, home of the world's finest

3
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:41,440
JavaScript
meet-up, the very famous Brooklyn JS, not

4
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:44,930
to knock the
other JS.

5
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:48,790
Here we go.

6
00:00:48,790 --> 00:01:03,390
So my computer is ... Uh-huh
... Okay.

7
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:06,660
You know, you would expect a lot of things
when you're about to do a talk.

8
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:11,000
The last thing you
expect is your computer to just shut down

9
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,280
on you.

10
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:24,710
But
these things happen.

11
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:25,710
And okay.

12
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:26,710
Yay!

13
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:27,710
All right.

14
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:28,710
applause].

15
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:29,710
All right, right back to it.

16
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:32,759
So, I'm going
to talk basically about being the only engineer

17
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:35,770
in
a non-technical organisation, and, you know,

18
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:38,360
this could
because you're a consultant working with a

19
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:42,220
company that
has no technical expertise, or it could because

20
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:45,709
you're
the only engineer on salary at a company that

21
00:01:45,709 --> 00:01:49,039
maybe has
like outsource developers.

22
00:01:49,039 --> 00:01:52,379
And I'm just going to
explain a little bit about how I came to that

23
00:01:52,379 --> 00:01:54,160
position
and what I did with it.

24
00:01:54,160 --> 00:02:01,420
So yet again, I'm Sarah
Saltic-Meyer, hit me up on Twitter: Meyerini.

25
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:07,920
And
I started out at a tech company where more

26
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:12,760
than
50 per cent of the staff were software engineers.

27
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,530
And
you know, we were a pretty cool.

28
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:20,209
Web development
company in 2013, so we were on that backbone

29
00:02:20,209 --> 00:02:26,570
in rails,
you know, Ts all about the monolithic MVC

30
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:29,999
single page
app, and, you know, that's where I sort of

31
00:02:29,999 --> 00:02:31,510
grew up as an
engineer.

32
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:39,459
That's where I learned best practices and
where I, you know, kind of absorbed what software

33
00:02:39,459 --> 00:02:43,019
engineering was, which was like constant refactoring.

34
00:02:43,019 --> 00:02:45,549
You know, always pushing for technical excellent,
well

35
00:02:45,549 --> 00:02:47,170
tested code.

36
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:51,780
All the good things that we come and talk
about at conferences like this, and it was

37
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:55,730
a particular
kind of culture, like video games.

38
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:58,489
We didn't work at
all on the day when Apple would do a developer

39
00:02:58,489 --> 00:03:01,219
conference, because there are things that
are more

40
00:03:01,219 --> 00:03:06,019
important in life, and I loved it there.

41
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:10,099
That was
a company in Boston, and I really wanted to

42
00:03:10,099 --> 00:03:13,329
go back to
New York, which is where I grew up.

43
00:03:13,329 --> 00:03:19,170
So I did that, sort
of ran away, you know, took a job for the

44
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:24,049
sake of taking
a job, which was, you know, kind of a terrible

45
00:03:24,049 --> 00:03:28,659
idea in
a sense because I almost immediately got coached

46
00:03:28,659 --> 00:03:33,870
by the
company of my dreams, I felt really connected

47
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:36,209
to the
product, not so much a technical product,

48
00:03:36,209 --> 00:03:40,530
but just
having the opportunity to work on it.

49
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:43,860
I couldn't turn
it down, didn't turn it down.

50
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:48,510
So in this non-technical
organisation there was suddenly one technical

51
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:51,030
person and
that was me.

52
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:57,079
So, you know, what did I do there, and
what do you do there?

53
00:03:57,079 --> 00:04:02,859
It was another single page app
this time because it was 2014 where were on

54
00:04:02,859 --> 00:04:07,319
to angular,
and we had -- it was an e-commerce that had

55
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:11,819
a big
loading spinner every time you got there,

56
00:04:11,819 --> 00:04:13,370
and I hated
that.

57
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:16,620
I thought there was so much to be done to
improve

58
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:21,519
it, and so I wanted us to move to service
side rendering

59
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:28,190
of our pages, I wanted us to get away from
angular and

60
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:32,870
rendering and that was one of my first things,
looking

61
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:39,270
through the app, figuring out what test coverage
was

62
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:44,220
necessary, and what -- you know, if there
were better

63
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:47,150
ways that we could be rendering our templates,
like

64
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:49,830
anything that was in Hamil C, maybe, should
have been in

65
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:53,699
Hamil.

66
00:04:53,699 --> 00:04:58,850
A lot of what I did there, because it was
a non-technical organisation again, we had

67
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:04,539
print
designers doing our web design, which resulted

68
00:05:04,539 --> 00:05:09,470
in some
very beautiful pages, but if you have ever

69
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:13,889
fought the
battle of -- well, the mobile design looks

70
00:05:13,889 --> 00:05:17,099
like things
as you have elements A, B and C, and then

71
00:05:17,099 --> 00:05:22,271
on the desktop
designs it is elements C, B and A, then you

72
00:05:22,271 --> 00:05:25,490
know of my
struggle at this company.

73
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:29,449
(Laughter) . It was a lot
of: gosh, well, we can make it look prettier

74
00:05:29,449 --> 00:05:33,139
at this
great point, and at this point, but anywhere

75
00:05:33,139 --> 00:05:36,710
in between
we are utterly screwed and no one has considered

76
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:37,710
this.

77
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:41,160
Also, you know, one of the things when you
are at

78
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:43,599
a non-technical company, you're probably not
going to

79
00:05:43,599 --> 00:05:47,810
get to work on big projects, interesting projects,
the

80
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:50,770
kind of projects that get you up in the morning
as an

81
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:51,770
engineer.

82
00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:58,520
You know, when you're taking something and
building a web framework that has never been

83
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:00,331
built
before, you're not solving problems that have

84
00:06:00,331 --> 00:06:03,310
never been
solved before; you're building landing pages

85
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:09,740
for -- to
sell make-up, and I wanted to do that because

86
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:13,240
I identified with that product.

87
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:21,190
But it wasn't
engineering; it was web design.

88
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:26,800
And I think generally,
when you are the only person making these

89
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:31,680
decisions, you
don't get to choose, basically.

90
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,220
So how did I respond to
this?

91
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:37,500
I got more productive than I'd ever been in
my

92
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,500
life before.

93
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:43,250
I used to be a lazy developer, but I think
a lot of us fall into software engineering,

94
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:46,849
because it
is a pretty reliable line of work.

95
00:06:46,849 --> 00:06:50,259
I've responded to
being the only person who could fix things

96
00:06:50,259 --> 00:06:54,960
by purely
trying to fix them, getting up every day and

97
00:06:54,960 --> 00:07:01,069
working on
weekends, and I also -- we had lunch & learns

98
00:07:01,069 --> 00:07:04,100
at this
company, and I hosted about three or four

99
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:09,470
lunch & learns
on web development, and I got the social media

100
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:13,219
manager
and the executive assistant building their

101
00:07:13,219 --> 00:07:17,069
own personal
websites and HTML and CSS, and this was was

102
00:07:17,069 --> 00:07:21,449
the most
gratifying thing possible, building empathy

103
00:07:21,449 --> 00:07:25,970
for software
engineering by making it more of my kind around

104
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:27,389
me.

105
00:07:27,389 --> 00:07:30,449
So
if you have opportunity to do that, this is

106
00:07:30,449 --> 00:07:33,460
possible,
you know, maybe not for consultants who are

107
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:36,800
working, but
definitely possible if you are a salary employee

108
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,419
working
in the same physical location as these non-technical

109
00:07:40,419 --> 00:07:41,490
staff members.

110
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:47,509
You know, there is an engineer inside
everyone just waiting to come out.

111
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:53,629
And a lot of people
recognise that engineering is sort of a better

112
00:07:53,629 --> 00:07:56,550
thing
than the one they may have, and there may

113
00:07:56,550 --> 00:08:01,800
be people on
your customer support team or on your marketing

114
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:05,880
team who
really want what you have, which is the skills

115
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:09,050
that got
you into the job that you have.

116
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:14,970
And, you know, seek
them out and use them.

117
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:22,550
So you're also now, when you are
the only engineer, you're the only champion

118
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:24,460
that
technology has.

119
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:29,500
You know, if you come from
a traditional engineering environment, whoever

120
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:32,603
the sort
of top engineer is, you know, your CTO, your

121
00:08:32,603 --> 00:08:35,800
VP of
engineering, that person's job in addition

122
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:39,210
to making
decisions and managing the day-to-day work

123
00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:42,969
of the
department, they are always advocating for

124
00:08:42,969 --> 00:08:48,560
technology
to, you know, your C-level team or your owner

125
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,080
of the
business.

126
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:56,750
And so if you have a powerful CTL, then
that's somebody who can take the time to say,

127
00:08:56,750 --> 00:09:00,639
"Well we
need to spend a week writing tests for this,

128
00:09:00,639 --> 00:09:07,410
or we spend
to spend a month refactoring our order service."

129
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:11,120
If you
don't have somebody like that as a buffer

130
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:14,290
between you
and management, then you are suddenly the

131
00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:15,730
buffer.

132
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:17,690
You
are both the engine and the buffer between

133
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:20,760
the engine
and what's trying to make the engine work.

134
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:25,170
So you need
a) to really really work on your communication

135
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:29,940
skills,
and (b), you need to have a certain amount

136
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:35,070
of like
gravitas and weight within the company.

137
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:38,880
Basically, that
upper management needs to trust you that you're

138
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,660
not just
fucking around when you say, "I need more

139
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:44,779
time to do
this, to do it right."

140
00:09:44,779 --> 00:09:49,290
And if they don't trust you,
then you will not get that time, and your

141
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:51,329
product will
suffer for it.

142
00:09:51,329 --> 00:09:52,820
Pretty much inevitably.

143
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:56,980
On the other hand, there is a huge bright
side which

144
00:09:56,980 --> 00:10:00,000
is that as if you were the only engineer,
nobody is

145
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,730
going to teach you how to be a better engineer
at that

146
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:03,860
company.

147
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:09,690
So much of what we do as engineers on a team
is the kind of unacknowledged labour of tutoring

148
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:14,279
other
developers, and this happens pretty much automatically

149
00:10:14,279 --> 00:10:16,490
when you're working next to somebody who does
a similar

150
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:20,060
thing to you, even the most junior developer
and the

151
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:24,300
most senior, the intersection, the diagram
of their

152
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:27,860
knowledge is not the total sum of their knowledge,
but

153
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:32,610
two people together know more than any one
person could.

154
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:35,750
And so basically, by osmosis, turning to somebody
and

155
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:42,279
saying "how do I do this?", and obviously
things like

156
00:10:42,279 --> 00:10:46,339
you're slack, you're IRAC, you end up learning
quite

157
00:10:46,339 --> 00:10:50,980
a bit, but when you're the only engineer,
you don't have

158
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:51,980
that.

159
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:58,310
So maybe you get good at spreadsheets, because
spreadsheets are the way your company communicates

160
00:10:58,310 --> 00:10:59,310
with
each other.

161
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:02,910
This was the case with me; if it didn't
exist in a spreadsheet, it wasn't real.

162
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:07,010
Or maybe you
get really good at e-mails or maybe try to

163
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:10,091
spend a lot
of time with that print designer who is actually

164
00:11:10,091 --> 00:11:14,730
really
good at their job and understands colour and

165
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:16,750
spacing in
a way that you never will.

166
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:20,671
But, you know, you can learn
from them, you can learn from that, and you

167
00:11:20,671 --> 00:11:21,671
should.

168
00:11:21,671 --> 00:11:28,240
Because it is the most you are going to get
in terms of

169
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,240
skill growth.

170
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:34,740
We've all been there, sort of a solitary
developer with stack overflow as their only

171
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:37,110
real friend.

172
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:39,680
You always have stack overflow but that's
never where

173
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,329
you're going to do most of your skill.

174
00:11:42,329 --> 00:11:45,940
If you for
instance want -- like I did -- to learn how

175
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:50,860
to deal with
problems of scale, which are some of the most

176
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:56,790
interesting at a web development company,
then you're

177
00:11:56,790 --> 00:12:00,649
not going to have the chance to do that as
sort of

178
00:12:00,649 --> 00:12:02,850
a lone wolf.

179
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:07,400
Anything that you can teach yourself,
you'll learn, and anything that cannot be

180
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:10,310
taught by
other people, you will not learn.

181
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:16,430
So, you know, I felt very isolated a lot of
the time

182
00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:18,820
until something happened to me, which is that
I started

183
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:21,779
going to meet-ups.

184
00:12:21,779 --> 00:12:28,370
And the first time I got on the
Brooklyn JS slack channel, it was like a revelation,

185
00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:32,209
there were cat gifts flying back and forth
again, there

186
00:12:32,209 --> 00:12:36,810
were JavaScript and functional programming
jokes which

187
00:12:36,810 --> 00:12:41,100
are all terrible but they're the jokes we
have, and we

188
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:42,730
love them.

189
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:49,860
So it turned out that as isolated as I felt
there, I was really in the centre of a much

190
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:54,529
larger
universe of developers in New York.

191
00:12:54,529 --> 00:12:57,490
There were
literally hundreds of people around me who

192
00:12:57,490 --> 00:13:02,770
I could go to
for the sense of community, and sort of growth

193
00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:08,660
opportunities that I needed as a developer.

194
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:12,009
When you
experience stagnation, actually, even if you

195
00:13:12,009 --> 00:13:14,899
are in the
middle of a large engineering team and start

196
00:13:14,899 --> 00:13:18,899
to feel
you're become stagnated, well guys, go to

197
00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:20,079
a meet-up.

198
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:21,850
You're already here, so I can't tell you to
go to a

199
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:26,880
conference, you clearly learned that trick,
but there

200
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:30,070
are people out there who will actually, just
for love

201
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:33,500
and not for money, do the work of teaching
you.

202
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,279
Do the
work of supporting you.

203
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:39,200
Do the work of being your
friend, which is work, and actually, when

204
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,630
you were at
a company, that's part of what you're getting

205
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:42,589
paid to
do, secretly.

206
00:13:42,589 --> 00:13:47,269
The last thing is that if you were the only
engineer

207
00:13:47,269 --> 00:13:51,030
at a company, if you were only the technical
person,

208
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:53,779
don't be scared to leave.

209
00:13:53,779 --> 00:13:57,800
I didn't get into that job
because I wanted to be the only engineer at

210
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,199
that company
forever.

211
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:02,009
I wanted there to be more of me.

212
00:14:02,009 --> 00:14:06,940
And when --
how do you get more engineers besides helping

213
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:10,279
the social
media manager build her own website?

214
00:14:10,279 --> 00:14:12,339
You hire them.

215
00:14:12,339 --> 00:14:14,690
One of the most important things when you're
at a small

216
00:14:14,690 --> 00:14:17,779
company is whether you have any authority
in the hiring

217
00:14:17,779 --> 00:14:21,420
process, whether candidates that you bring
to your

218
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:25,380
bosses will be considered, and whether you
get any, you

219
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:30,639
know, yes or no input on candidates.

220
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:34,959
If you don't have
either of those things, you should consider

221
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:39,930
what kind of
company or culture you're in, and as the realisation

222
00:14:39,930 --> 00:14:43,380
that slowly caught up to me when after six
months of

223
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:46,060
being the only person there, I still was the
only person

224
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:50,450
there, decided that it wasn't for me after
all, being

225
00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:51,699
the lone wolf.

226
00:14:51,699 --> 00:14:53,540
So I left.

227
00:14:53,540 --> 00:15:01,009
I went to another big
engineering company in New York, a 60-person

228
00:15:01,009 --> 00:15:02,009
developer
team.

229
00:15:02,009 --> 00:15:05,990
I am happy to say I have everything I could
want

230
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:11,250
in a job there, but the knowledge of what
will happen,

231
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:13,230
the knowledge of what I will face if I ever
go into the

232
00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:17,370
situation again, if I decided to start my
own start-up,

233
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:27,600
or decided to be the CTO or the founding technical
member of the team, it is all going to happen

234
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,180
again, the
struggles are going to be the same, and in

235
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:33,100
some ways
they'll be even worse, but I know what they

236
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:34,839
are now, so
I'm not scared.
