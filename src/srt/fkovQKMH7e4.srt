[Applause]

13
00:00:36,629 --> 00:00:38,739
okay I'll how are you guys doing today

14
00:00:38,739 --> 00:00:43,430
y'all I'm really glad to be here

15
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:47,740
so this talk is about civic hacking j/s

16
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:49,750
pretty much helping your compute

17
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:53,350
community with JavaScript or how as

18
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:55,960
exposed and eventually use javascript

19
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:58,149
and learned a lot of things about

20
00:00:58,149 --> 00:01:01,180
different frameworks doing Saavik civic

21
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:06,490
hacking throughout texas but first how

22
00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:10,390
am I really what do you know about me so

23
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:12,610
I graduated from Notre Dame with a

24
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:15,490
degree in environmental science and from

25
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:17,650
there I was an environmental scientist

26
00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:20,799
and oil and gas got laid off and I've

27
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:22,930
had to come to like Jesus moment and I

28
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:24,340
was like what am I good at

29
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:29,040
and I was like coding and fencing so I

30
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,900
actually end up becoming a fencing coach

31
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:34,990
at a new brand new club and I saw was

32
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:36,520
there in-house developer and I

33
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:38,650
freelanced for three years while trying

34
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:41,080
to find my full-time gig in back in

35
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:44,530
Houston along the way every six months I

36
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:46,720
would do something very drastic to try

37
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,659
to get a tech job and one of the things

38
00:01:49,659 --> 00:01:52,299
I ended up doing was like becoming a

39
00:01:52,299 --> 00:01:56,020
tech organizer a little bit but another

40
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:58,450
thing I did before I decide speaking was

41
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:01,750
a thing was actually got involved in

42
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:06,159
civic hacking so but now I'm an

43
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:08,500
associate scientist and training at

44
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:12,010
crimson Vista doing cybersecurity so in

45
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:15,129
Baltimore so I just started back in like

46
00:02:15,129 --> 00:02:19,870
April so it's really brand-new thank you

47
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:23,000
[Applause]

48
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,430
so what is civic hacking really this is

49
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:30,090
a definition that open gov dated IO

50
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:33,829
gives but really civic hacking is just

51
00:02:33,829 --> 00:02:36,689
about people they're fed up about how

52
00:02:36,689 --> 00:02:39,150
slow government is moving but look

53
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:42,659
Kapiti has needs today and just a group

54
00:02:42,659 --> 00:02:46,129
of people are just very very angry at

55
00:02:46,129 --> 00:02:48,599
government slow processes and they're

56
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:50,489
just like let's get done today

57
00:02:50,489 --> 00:02:55,290
instead of like for like nope like

58
00:02:55,290 --> 00:03:02,609
February 2002 but who are Civic hackers

59
00:03:02,609 --> 00:03:04,790
other than these people being angry

60
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:07,079
Civic hackers can be anyone in the

61
00:03:07,079 --> 00:03:09,120
community actually can be you it could

62
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,919
be you and the man in the mirror but you

63
00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:13,439
know that is a Michael Jackson joke and

64
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:16,769
I'm kind of off topic because this is

65
00:03:16,769 --> 00:03:20,659
supposed to be a prince - a prince talk

66
00:03:20,659 --> 00:03:25,159
but pretty much any one day has like any

67
00:03:25,159 --> 00:03:29,819
needs and any technical skill can join

68
00:03:29,819 --> 00:03:34,319
it's inclusive but really what did I get

69
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:35,250
involved in this

70
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:38,669
I like there's me in the mayor and my

71
00:03:38,669 --> 00:03:41,579
prince pajamas somehow that happened but

72
00:03:41,579 --> 00:03:45,810
like really I'm a nice person and I like

73
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:48,540
doing good things so that was like

74
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:50,609
number one nostril checklist but really

75
00:03:50,609 --> 00:03:52,500
the big problem was I had hackathon

76
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,989
burnout so pretty much I was doing all

77
00:03:54,989 --> 00:03:58,530
these hackathons and building apps that

78
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:00,120
would never see the light of day after

79
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,549
that like weekend it would just end up

80
00:04:02,549 --> 00:04:05,400
going into the graveyard of github where

81
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:09,520
you know all the other to do apps

82
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:12,480
[Music]

83
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,040
but I actually was thinking to myself

84
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,910
instead of building like a fun app that

85
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:21,070
will never see the light of day what if

86
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:23,440
I had spent that at time building an app

87
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,300
that would actually help somebody and

88
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:28,180
like make a difference in somebody's

89
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:31,389
life so I wanted my work to be a little

90
00:04:31,389 --> 00:04:36,639
bit more meaningful so open data is

91
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:39,100
great I don't know about you but how

92
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:41,800
many of you guys have like done web

93
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:45,850
scraping for fun I saw hands go up and

94
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:50,050
and down at one point I like but I don't

95
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:52,270
know like web scraping like a government

96
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:53,979
web site is kind of different because

97
00:04:53,979 --> 00:04:57,430
I'm opposed to be like a wet hacker and

98
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:58,780
I don't want to find out the hard way

99
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:07,180
that orange isn't my color so open data

100
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:09,760
is great and all but what if we actually

101
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:13,600
built apps to be open source I know

102
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,099
there's a lot of frameworks that are

103
00:05:15,099 --> 00:05:16,660
open source that gives us tools but

104
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:20,050
already the big problem is cities across

105
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:23,229
the nation that have similar problems it

106
00:05:23,229 --> 00:05:25,060
would be great instead of like starting

107
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:26,590
out from scratch you can just go to

108
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:28,360
somebody else's repo and see what they

109
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:31,240
did and they would be like hey take our

110
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,919
work and like improve it to your own

111
00:05:32,919 --> 00:05:38,500
circumstances right another thing is

112
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:41,080
what I found out is civic hacking

113
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:43,740
communities are diverse naturally so

114
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:47,680
pretty much back in Houston the scene

115
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,270
over there pretty much as the

116
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:53,620
demographics of Houston so but in other

117
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:56,590
communities like Austin you have other

118
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:59,530
like there was an asterisks to this

119
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:01,510
because like in Austin there's problems

120
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:03,520
there there's jeremy gerrymandering

121
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:09,280
and also you know other things that have

122
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,960
been going on to push out certain

123
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,570
demographics and you see that when you

124
00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:15,820
actually go to those meetings because

125
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:17,860
like no one is going to drive 50 miles

126
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:19,720
just to do civic hacking

127
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:26,160
except me but that's another thing so I

128
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:30,160
end up going to the I drove down to

129
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,430
Austin with a friend so and I went down

130
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:36,970
to do a hackathon yet again I couldn't

131
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:39,850
escape them and did the hack for Change

132
00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:42,100
and pretty much why I found there was a

133
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:46,210
project to using reacts so budget party

134
00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:55,540
was that was a app built on reactor to

135
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,040
help people understand the budget and

136
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:59,350
get voters excited about what's going on

137
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:01,990
with the budget and why should we and

138
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:03,970
why should we like be concerned and

139
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:07,900
actually look at it so I was really

140
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:10,570
excited to get in there so another thing

141
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:13,570
about civic hacking is JavaScript has

142
00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:16,810
like a wide pithre ax of different

143
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:19,210
frameworks and tools and you could just

144
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:22,210
decide to use anything you want and no

145
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:25,419
one's gonna judge you for it so and you

146
00:07:25,419 --> 00:07:26,650
get to play with different tools that

147
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:28,360
you haven't get to play with or play

148
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,890
with tools that you would play with at

149
00:07:29,890 --> 00:07:32,710
work but you're afraid to like mess

150
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:34,210
around with them at work because they're

151
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:35,860
gonna shut everything down and make

152
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:40,060
everything implode and get fired so I

153
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:42,490
ended up learning about react at the

154
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:45,040
time cuz I wasn't I wasn't I wasn't

155
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:48,010
angular one person at the time so I just

156
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:51,100
wanted to like learn about react and I

157
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:55,200
was able to because due to membership so

158
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,790
one of the things that our community

159
00:07:57,790 --> 00:08:00,580
sometimes stumbles on is mentorship

160
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:04,360
outside jobs because like I know our

161
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,520
industry really wants people there like

162
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,470
senior roles but like they came from

163
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:11,530
somewhere people don't sprout out and

164
00:08:11,530 --> 00:08:14,050
become like senior developers what eight

165
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:16,060
years experience wouldn't react out of

166
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:21,490
nowhere I liked how like the dev opening

167
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:25,690
said you know but what I really liked

168
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:27,669
about this was someone took the time out

169
00:08:27,669 --> 00:08:30,400
to help me understand react

170
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:34,210
and it became like a cycle so when I

171
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:36,279
ended up going back home I was teaching

172
00:08:36,279 --> 00:08:38,589
my other friends react and other

173
00:08:38,589 --> 00:08:40,599
framework so it was just like a good

174
00:08:40,599 --> 00:08:43,680
like circle of life kind of thing

175
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:46,120
another thing I found out at this RIT

176
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:50,050
hackathon was developers really do not

177
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:55,540
like WordPress so at the time what was

178
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:58,470
going on was there was this one project

179
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:01,060
that was using WordPress and there were

180
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:02,740
all designers and they wanted a feature

181
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:05,529
built and there was out of like 100

182
00:09:05,529 --> 00:09:07,480
developers no one would come and help

183
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:10,630
them and I felt sad for them and being a

184
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:14,410
nice person I went to help them and when

185
00:09:14,410 --> 00:09:16,450
I figured out was they had no

186
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:18,670
documentation on what the person before

187
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:21,790
did so I wasn't really able to help them

188
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:23,980
but I rendered I figured out how

189
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:27,130
important documentation was that day but

190
00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:29,860
at this point I realized I was missing

191
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:35,380
my keys my friend had my keys and I was

192
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:37,000
freaking out because I didn't want to

193
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,680
walk all the way back from Houston to

194
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:43,600
Austin like from Austin you know Seattle

195
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,370
and Portland is the same distance

196
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:47,620
between Austin and Houston's for some of

197
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:49,720
you guys still don't realize how big you

198
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:53,380
mean Texas is in general so I went over

199
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:55,660
to his room and figure out why hasn't he

200
00:09:55,660 --> 00:10:00,880
given back my keys so I found out that

201
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,040
his team was having a breakdown

202
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,650
they were pretty much siloed off into

203
00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:06,970
their roles and weren't communicating

204
00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:09,490
with each other it was pretty late on to

205
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:11,380
like the hackathon it was like pretty

206
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:14,230
much like 6 p.m. at the first day and

207
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:16,270
for hackathon terms if you don't have

208
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:18,990
anything by then that's pretty bad sign

209
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:22,209
so I decided to help them out

210
00:10:22,209 --> 00:10:24,550
I earned up building something for them

211
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:28,720
like I end up like do only a little like

212
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,270
site map for them and just a little

213
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:33,339
sketch to know that what they can plan

214
00:10:33,339 --> 00:10:34,180
on

215
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:37,000
and I wasn't really planning on doing

216
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:42,670
this but I I didn't really plan on doing

217
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:44,770
this but like they just needed direction

218
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:49,420
and to get something done but I wasn't

219
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:52,450
really expecting like what my work was

220
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:54,459
like have a name and actually have a

221
00:10:54,459 --> 00:10:59,080
role define to it so but because like at

222
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:01,839
that time I was just a freelancer mining

223
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:04,270
my own business just getting websites

224
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:07,660
built but I didn't know that there was a

225
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:09,910
whole section of our industry actually

226
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:12,190
made for people to tell these people

227
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:14,440
what to do so it was really important to

228
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:17,770
like think about your co-workers that

229
00:11:17,770 --> 00:11:20,890
you have back home that their work is as

230
00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:27,250
significant as well so and civic hacking

231
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:29,589
is pretty much about seeing a need and

232
00:11:29,589 --> 00:11:31,330
then filling that need no matter what

233
00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:38,329
your role is at work pretty much so I

234
00:11:38,339 --> 00:11:40,990
went back to my little react group for

235
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:43,630
budget party and I don't know about you

236
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:50,170
guys but bugs are like cockroaches like

237
00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:52,930
I don't know if you seen the cockroaches

238
00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:57,220
back in Texas but they fly and it's

239
00:11:57,220 --> 00:12:00,220
pretty similar to like at work like and

240
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:01,300
when you see one of these roaches

241
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:03,760
somebody is screaming it's usually a

242
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,400
manager and they don't screw able to

243
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,140
stop screaming until like the bug is

244
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:11,320
fixed and squash so like I took my

245
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:13,540
experience with like fixing like

246
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:17,680
squashing cockroaches to fixing bugs and

247
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:21,220
react and I actually ended up building a

248
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:23,440
little bit more confidence like instead

249
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,959
of being afraid of roaches and bugs I

250
00:12:25,959 --> 00:12:28,450
was like hey I can actually do this and

251
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:30,700
it just built up my confidence which

252
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:33,490
each one that I smushed it smashed along

253
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:38,770
so unfortunately I was the only person

254
00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:40,959
in my group that was based in Houston so

255
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:43,329
how did it go back home but I continued

256
00:12:43,329 --> 00:12:45,110
being part of their program

257
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:50,250
and helped out so but it was lonely so

258
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:53,510
we actually had successfully that app

259
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:55,730
end up going on to win the Mozilla

260
00:12:55,730 --> 00:12:58,250
Internet health prize and one of my

261
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:00,529
friends from the group going to England

262
00:13:00,529 --> 00:13:06,170
so I came back to Houston and then we

263
00:13:06,170 --> 00:13:09,110
had our own City hackathon pretty much a

264
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:11,959
day before the hackathon we found that

265
00:13:11,959 --> 00:13:14,420
Houston had a pot of money just for

266
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:17,209
housing that wasn't going to use it

267
00:13:17,209 --> 00:13:20,779
wasn't being used and pretty much that

268
00:13:20,779 --> 00:13:22,820
there was this rebranding of section 8

269
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:26,350
housing being called housing choice and

270
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:29,240
pretty much we came up with a plan like

271
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:32,899
about 16 to 20 of us actually came out

272
00:13:32,899 --> 00:13:35,290
with a plan for homelessness in the

273
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:37,880
vacant housing problem because of the

274
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:42,350
oil and gas like slump and we try to

275
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:44,089
figure it out we can build an app for

276
00:13:44,089 --> 00:13:52,930
this and

277
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:56,750
and we did we used HTML and CSS and of

278
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:59,690
course JavaScript you know JavaScript at

279
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:01,610
us hugs you know the parent you know

280
00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:06,200
whatever but because that's pretty much

281
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:09,560
what everyone knew we didn't know there

282
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:11,360
wasn't a collective of people knowing

283
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,010
just one framework and we didn't want

284
00:14:13,010 --> 00:14:15,950
anyone to be left behind so we kept it

285
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:21,530
vanilla we ended up building this super

286
00:14:21,530 --> 00:14:23,870
like elevation of an app trying to do

287
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:27,170
several things and we didn't win the

288
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:30,770
hackathon but the mayor called a society

289
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:33,230
it's like hey you're doing something

290
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:35,570
about this keep on doing this I give you

291
00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:37,310
permission to bug people they're

292
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:39,950
actually going to use this app so we

293
00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:41,750
rented up back to the drawing board and

294
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:43,850
we actually wanted to like go ahead and

295
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:45,320
interview these people so we could

296
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,940
actually build an app that would suit

297
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:52,580
their needs so we had a new plan in

298
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:55,400
place our group considerably shrink down

299
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:59,060
to five people and I was like I have a

300
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:00,890
game plan I'm gonna build this out and

301
00:15:00,890 --> 00:15:03,080
react as I learned it and then I'm gonna

302
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:05,480
use WordPress API to actually bring in

303
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,220
the data from the old databases of

304
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:09,320
government and then I'm gonna use meteor

305
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:12,530
AGS in the background and I moved on

306
00:15:12,530 --> 00:15:14,930
right thinking this is going to be done

307
00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:17,570
it's gonna be great but then this this

308
00:15:17,570 --> 00:15:22,510
happened I found out very quickly like

309
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:26,870
nine out of ten times government

310
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:28,610
officials will not meet with you they

311
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:32,000
are very very busy people in this hands

312
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,040
it was caseworkers they were overloaded

313
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:38,050
and kind of had to bribe them what lunch

314
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:41,620
Shh but to make them actually show up

315
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:45,310
but they did once or twice but it wasn't

316
00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:47,260
enough to actually flesh out this app

317
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:49,990
because we wanted this to be an app for

318
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:54,820
them and we found out like Houston is

319
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:59,110
big y'all we end up driving like 30 to

320
00:15:59,110 --> 00:16:02,500
40 miles into town each time and that

321
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:05,050
actually is a substantial gas bill after

322
00:16:05,050 --> 00:16:07,959
you do it a couple of times so we

323
00:16:07,959 --> 00:16:09,630
decided we're going to find a way to

324
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:11,800
sponsor ourselves and we're like let's

325
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,810
do grant money but that also is a long

326
00:16:13,810 --> 00:16:16,690
process that first you had to find the

327
00:16:16,690 --> 00:16:17,980
right grant for you

328
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:20,350
and then you have to wait until they

329
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:22,720
decide and read all the proposals and

330
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,540
then you might not even get it but this

331
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:26,610
was fine

332
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:30,040
we thought we could wait but it got to

333
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:33,550
the point that we just if you don't have

334
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:36,070
like we had all the energy but if the

335
00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:38,140
world doesn't want to work for your

336
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:39,880
change right now there's nothing you can

337
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:44,200
do to push it along so and we found out

338
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,510
housing like insurance is a very thick

339
00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:49,690
hard thing to improve but this was fun

340
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:52,899
because this happened so this is my

341
00:16:52,899 --> 00:16:56,020
neighborhood so pretty much you had the

342
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:59,620
palace in picture so what had happened

343
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:03,610
was Palestine was like the original

344
00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:07,240
flooding from Harvey and then you have

345
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:10,709
the armed guard over there saying hey

346
00:17:10,709 --> 00:17:13,089
you have to evacuate because we're going

347
00:17:13,089 --> 00:17:14,439
to release the dam and then they

348
00:17:14,439 --> 00:17:20,020
released a dam up on top so so all this

349
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:26,860
took over a week period so but I was

350
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:30,580
already in the slack group for our civic

351
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:34,510
hacking groups get City so we all

352
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:36,400
congregated there and then people from

353
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,800
outside of Houston also integrated in

354
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:41,020
there giving us like slack had to give

355
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:45,400
us free tier at the time and pretty much

356
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,809
we are in a building out like around

357
00:17:46,809 --> 00:17:49,840
like 2030 good apps like the big one

358
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:50,690
being Harvey

359
00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:53,870
and then we had like other ones for SMS

360
00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:55,730
attacks using Twitter and Twitter gave

361
00:17:55,730 --> 00:17:58,430
us free tier thank God

362
00:17:58,430 --> 00:18:02,270
also muck rack and just a lot of like

363
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:04,970
Maps and shelter and just telling people

364
00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:08,480
like where to go to get goods and needs

365
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:11,180
they might not hence the title Harvey

366
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:18,050
needs and I know that we don't really

367
00:18:18,050 --> 00:18:19,820
think about this much but like a little

368
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:22,220
speck machines matter so when we're

369
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:24,020
working in these groups like some of

370
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:26,480
these people are working from like their

371
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,390
teams at work and they have like various

372
00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:32,270
ways they build things like things that

373
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:34,580
actually you have to go and use things

374
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:38,780
that you have to use sources like

375
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:41,270
applications that actually use like 16

376
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:43,910
Giga RAM to get in so all you get to you

377
00:18:43,910 --> 00:18:45,620
get to the point that you start up and

378
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:47,600
you're only able to clone the repo and

379
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,160
then you're not able to do anything else

380
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:51,290
and then you're not actually able to

381
00:18:51,290 --> 00:18:53,450
like go to localhost which is really not

382
00:18:53,450 --> 00:18:56,150
exciting so it's really heartbreaking as

383
00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:58,070
a developer for someone to tell you that

384
00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:01,010
your machine is a parity a barrier to

385
00:19:01,010 --> 00:19:04,580
entry but what's really heartbreaking is

386
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:06,890
that you end up building like a desktop

387
00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:10,820
app and no one can use this desktop app

388
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:13,820
because your users don't have desktops

389
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:16,280
they only have phones and no one can go

390
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,650
to the library because your library is

391
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:20,930
flooded so no one can use your desktop

392
00:19:20,930 --> 00:19:29,860
app so I know so setting up development

393
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:32,920
environments can be a lengthy process

394
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:35,960
like we have so many like spin-ups

395
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:38,780
and CIS so this helped us like develop

396
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:43,040
quicker oh I don't know do people

397
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:44,780
actually like playing with wet pack and

398
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:48,380
starting things up I'm like cuz that

399
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:50,210
could take that could take a couple of

400
00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:54,230
hours honestly so we end up things using

401
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:56,660
things like CRA CMS is like WordPress

402
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:58,880
even though people don't like WordPress

403
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,710
they saw like they needed to get things

404
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:03,760
up quickly so they they used it

405
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:06,050
another thing we found out really easily

406
00:20:06,050 --> 00:20:08,420
it was pair programming was very useful

407
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:10,550
especially when you lost your laptop in

408
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:14,620
the flood and you still wanted to code

409
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:18,800
so you know so you got to like hang out

410
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,210
with your friend and use their laptop

411
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:24,080
and also still be able to contribute

412
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:29,390
right but then also coding blind is very

413
00:20:29,390 --> 00:20:32,150
hard especially when you're trying to

414
00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:36,110
like some people are just like putting

415
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:40,070
in HTML tags and like turn in and over

416
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:42,320
slack and just like they're not part of

417
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,700
the you can't stand up their own

418
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:45,980
development repo so they're trying to

419
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:49,400
contribute but you can't really see what

420
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,320
like as front-end people you can't

421
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:52,850
really see what's going on and you just

422
00:20:52,850 --> 00:20:54,800
have to like hope that your code makes

423
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,900
it look right and have the faith that

424
00:20:56,900 --> 00:21:00,190
somebody else will correct your mistakes

425
00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:02,870
and talking about mistakes it's okay to

426
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:05,480
fail in this circumstances because

427
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:06,980
you're not getting paid for the work

428
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:10,429
you're doing so and your job is not on

429
00:21:10,429 --> 00:21:12,230
the line it's just millions of others

430
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:14,480
but like they weren't gonna get anything

431
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:20,929
done in the first place so so it's like

432
00:21:20,929 --> 00:21:24,860
it's a safe place to fail so no one's

433
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:26,420
gonna blame you they're gonna be like

434
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:29,570
damn I really wish during this hurricane

435
00:21:29,570 --> 00:21:31,880
this developer got this thing right I'm

436
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:35,059
like no it's more like hey I hate you

437
00:21:35,059 --> 00:21:40,550
mother nature my home is gone but it

438
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:45,020
wasn't just only coding so we pretty

439
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:46,910
much had a environmental crisis our

440
00:21:46,910 --> 00:21:49,400
hands so like my background and the

441
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,950
viral science helped out especially when

442
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:53,929
it came to like water quality and then

443
00:21:53,929 --> 00:21:55,460
finding out that everything was

444
00:21:55,460 --> 00:22:01,309
contaminated so but then again hurricane

445
00:22:01,309 --> 00:22:02,900
armor happened and we really weren't

446
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:04,940
expecting that to happen like really

447
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:08,840
like for like oh this is almost gone we

448
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:10,490
can go back to normal but then this

449
00:22:10,490 --> 00:22:13,340
happened and pretty much we ended up

450
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:15,860
going to a different flat group and in

451
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:17,090
that slack group

452
00:22:17,090 --> 00:22:18,830
it was pretty much the armored response

453
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:22,130
group so pretty much the people from

454
00:22:22,130 --> 00:22:24,230
Houston we migrated over to that slack

455
00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:26,210
group and we were like hey here's all

456
00:22:26,210 --> 00:22:28,940
the apps we built all you need to do is

457
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:34,100
change the branding and like the URL and

458
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:37,190
here you go right so we helped with

459
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:39,140
homelink we didn't build the same thing

460
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:42,560
twice but there were some innovations

461
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:44,420
that happened on like from they learned

462
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:46,190
from our mistakes they had the chat box

463
00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:49,070
so pretty much a tat box was an easy way

464
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:51,110
for people that were fleeing their homes

465
00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:54,320
to like actually use their phones and

466
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:57,080
get in touch with simple messages to

467
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:59,120
like guide them on the right path

468
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:03,860
so however unlike the team back in

469
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:05,420
Houston that all knew each other

470
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:08,660
the Florida team was people that really

471
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:10,910
didn't hang out together so they didn't

472
00:23:10,910 --> 00:23:12,770
really know each other and they were all

473
00:23:12,770 --> 00:23:14,360
in different cities and they didn't have

474
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:18,260
like one big central like big city that

475
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:20,240
all of them met each other so they

476
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,650
didn't really know each other and it was

477
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:24,710
just like a circle of like trust not

478
00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:26,570
being there so let's do a little trust

479
00:23:26,570 --> 00:23:31,910
exercise so how many people can trust a

480
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:33,830
person that's sitting next to them their

481
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:39,560
code raise your hand I saw hands go up

482
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:43,060
and down what is this it's like wavering

483
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:49,040
make a choice okay now all the people

484
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:51,770
that still have their hands up put your

485
00:23:51,770 --> 00:23:55,820
hands down if the person that is next to

486
00:23:55,820 --> 00:24:03,710
you as a co-worker put your hand down if

487
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:05,630
the person next to you is the Twitter

488
00:24:05,630 --> 00:24:09,430
celebrity

489
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:12,660
okay so it was only like like this group

490
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:16,170
over here like what's your story ah so

491
00:24:16,170 --> 00:24:18,570
they had a community where they actually

492
00:24:18,570 --> 00:24:21,270
learned from each other similar to civic

493
00:24:21,270 --> 00:24:24,270
hacking and thus why they trust each

494
00:24:24,270 --> 00:24:26,880
other despite working long hours at work

495
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:30,630
or seeing Twitter feeds of different

496
00:24:30,630 --> 00:24:32,610
code geniuses things they've done in the

497
00:24:32,610 --> 00:24:38,370
past so and also there was different

498
00:24:38,370 --> 00:24:40,290
sources of data but you know people

499
00:24:40,290 --> 00:24:42,000
couldn't really trust that source of

500
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
data because it ain't trust that person

501
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,500
causing like a cachet of like an

502
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:48,000
infinite loop they couldn't get out of

503
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,050
of data trust so but then Hurricane

504
00:24:52,050 --> 00:24:54,720
Maria happened and that was different

505
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:57,510
because assembly using a slack group we

506
00:24:57,510 --> 00:24:59,970
are and abusing whatsapp and what

507
00:24:59,970 --> 00:25:02,610
whatsapp you know there's a limit of how

508
00:25:02,610 --> 00:25:05,370
many people can be on that group so we

509
00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:08,850
actually end up losing people and we

510
00:25:08,850 --> 00:25:10,980
didn't run we're in contact with some

511
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:12,710
people and we didn't hear from them

512
00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:15,510
during and some of them we didn't hear

513
00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:18,440
from them after so it was a scary time

514
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:21,030
we were prepared to do the same things

515
00:25:21,030 --> 00:25:23,850
but it was a little bit different from

516
00:25:23,850 --> 00:25:25,559
like some of my group of friends we

517
00:25:25,559 --> 00:25:27,900
ended up doing a create negative that

518
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:31,860
and we actually thought it was a great

519
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:34,140
idea because people would actually use

520
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:37,350
their phones first and it just didn't

521
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:41,450
work out because like FEMA was like no

522
00:25:41,450 --> 00:25:46,530
like no not on my watch and I just had

523
00:25:46,530 --> 00:25:48,420
to find out there's some things that the

524
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:50,730
government should actually pay attention

525
00:25:50,730 --> 00:25:56,100
to and actually just they should be in

526
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:57,660
charge of that and they should do that

527
00:25:57,660 --> 00:26:00,630
but it shouldn't always solved they

528
00:26:00,630 --> 00:26:01,950
shouldn't always fall down to

529
00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:03,570
individuals because there's only so much

530
00:26:03,570 --> 00:26:08,460
we can do but the good thing is through

531
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:11,370
this getting to know people in person

532
00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:13,559
and joining an open like source

533
00:26:13,559 --> 00:26:15,870
community the civic hacking is pretty

534
00:26:15,870 --> 00:26:17,669
much the most open source that you can

535
00:26:17,669 --> 00:26:20,460
but on the fly I was able to get back to

536
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:21,810
open source and

537
00:26:21,810 --> 00:26:25,200
the rat community and also participate

538
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:29,850
in a friendly what is it called a

539
00:26:29,850 --> 00:26:32,400
holiday party where the reacting that

540
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:35,040
pitcher is react versus angular and I

541
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:37,980
was on the react team and we gently like

542
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:43,230
one against angular by one point so but

543
00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:45,120
it brings me back so like meaningful

544
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:48,480
work I'm like I don't know about you but

545
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,580
there's like different apps like

546
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:52,020
everyone's working on different things

547
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:55,050
at it like work but like some things are

548
00:26:55,050 --> 00:26:57,300
more crucial than others and then some

549
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:59,720
people are just working on is hot dogs

550
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:05,130
so but there's a way like if you're

551
00:27:05,130 --> 00:27:07,770
working on is hot dog that is fine you

552
00:27:07,770 --> 00:27:10,680
have to make your money somehow but you

553
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:13,290
can just if you want to get involved you

554
00:27:13,290 --> 00:27:15,840
can get involved like doing things small

555
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,790
and local you don't have to go far you

556
00:27:17,790 --> 00:27:21,080
don't have to drive around a whole state

557
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:23,520
plan a you can just join your local

558
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,740
brigade like every city has a brigade

559
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:28,830
the brigades I went to were open Austin

560
00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:30,960
and the my local brigade would sketch

561
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:34,320
city and you can find your brigade right

562
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:37,440
here like there's a website for that so

563
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:40,470
if you want to get involved but if if

564
00:27:40,470 --> 00:27:43,260
you don't have time or if there isn't a

565
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:45,420
brigade you can start your own honestly

566
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:48,240
but there's always Plan B you can

567
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:51,510
convince your workplace and usually if

568
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:53,280
you're like working in a good place your

569
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:55,620
workplace will be like yeah we'll go for

570
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:57,540
it but if you're working for a like a

571
00:27:57,540 --> 00:27:59,550
more you know where you work for though

572
00:27:59,550 --> 00:28:01,710
really like I don't have to like tell

573
00:28:01,710 --> 00:28:03,750
you like to put yourself out there if

574
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:05,460
it's a place that you know they're not

575
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:08,190
going to go for this but you know that's

576
00:28:08,190 --> 00:28:10,860
my little shady thing you know if you

577
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:15,840
work for evil calm so pretty much this

578
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:19,380
has been a tale of pretty much my

579
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:21,720
hacking experience Pacific was safe

580
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:24,810
akaky in 2017 I'm glad you guys stayed

581
00:28:24,810 --> 00:28:26,700
frigid journey and these are things I

582
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:29,190
