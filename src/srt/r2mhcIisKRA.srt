00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:15,470

and so today my talk is going to be

2
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:19,160
about responsive web and a few months

3
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:21,680
ago my company decided to undergo a

4
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:24,890
visual brand redesign where they get to

5
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:27,460
unify the design language of the site

6
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:29,810
but at the same time they wanted to make

7
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:32,750
the site responsive so during the

8
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:35,180
responsive web project I noticed that we

9
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:37,340
did a lot of mistakes that we could have

10
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:40,910
avoided if we had known of the common

11
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:43,250
problems in responsive web development

12
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:45,860
earlier so this is what my talk is going

13
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:47,620
to be about today it's going to be about

14
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:50,240
the responsive web mistakes that we did

15
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:53,420
how we solve it and what you can do to

16
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:56,870
avoid it so a little bit about me I'm a

17
00:00:56,870 --> 00:00:57,560
Shawn Raney

18
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:00,770
I go by Ren Aisha on the Internet

19
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:03,759
I work as a front-end engineer at Vicky

20
00:01:03,759 --> 00:01:06,770
Vicky is a global TV site powered by

21
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:09,320
France where fans gets from communities

22
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:13,950
to supply those two shows on the site

23
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:16,310
responsive web development workflow is

24
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:18,350
very different from a non responsive one

25
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:19,840
and I learned this the hard way

26
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:23,689
so this because in responsive web divide

27
00:01:23,689 --> 00:01:26,899
an on responsive website you have a site

28
00:01:26,899 --> 00:01:28,999
that is supposed to work on several

29
00:01:28,999 --> 00:01:31,399
browsers and it should only work on

30
00:01:31,399 --> 00:01:35,499
desktop but on responsive site you have

31
00:01:35,499 --> 00:01:38,149
several different screen sizes and

32
00:01:38,149 --> 00:01:40,069
different devices that you need to take

33
00:01:40,069 --> 00:01:42,829
into account off and during my time

34
00:01:42,829 --> 00:01:45,170
working on the project I noticed that

35
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:47,329
there are three common problems that

36
00:01:47,329 --> 00:01:49,909
keep on recurring and this problem

37
00:01:49,909 --> 00:01:52,459
always centers on how designers and

38
00:01:52,459 --> 00:01:54,799
developers work together how to ensure

39
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:56,389
that you're writing maintainable code

40
00:01:56,389 --> 00:01:59,539
and coming up with testing and debugging

41
00:01:59,539 --> 00:02:02,479
strategy more often than not I think

42
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:04,969
responsive web development will force

43
00:02:04,969 --> 00:02:07,850
you to change your design development

44
00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:10,009
and testing workflow and I find that

45
00:02:10,009 --> 00:02:12,709
changing this workflow is especially

46
00:02:12,709 --> 00:02:14,810
challenging especially when you're

47
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:17,270
working on revamping a non responsive

48
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:22,100
site to a responsive one because chances

49
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:24,230
are you and your team members are

50
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:25,560
already used to

51
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:28,620
working on the non responsive web

52
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:30,360
development workflow which brings me to

53
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,780
my very first blooper of the day

54
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:35,910
initially during our responsive web

55
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:38,760
project we had a lack of collaboration

56
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:41,100
between designers and developers

57
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:43,890
there's a lot of back-and-forth style of

58
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:47,790
communication between us and initially

59
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:49,650
this communication works fine for us

60
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:52,560
during our pre responsive era but during

61
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,810
the project itself it becomes a major

62
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:57,420
problem and as you know old habits die

63
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:57,959
hard

64
00:02:57,959 --> 00:03:00,390
without actually noticing it we adopt

65
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:02,130
the same communication style in a

66
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:06,390
responsive web project and it turns out

67
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:10,590
to be a problem for us so what do I

68
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:13,110
meant by a back and forth style

69
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:15,720
communication so you have a designer and

70
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:18,060
designer will pass a high fidelity

71
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:21,120
design markup to developer and during

72
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,980
the development stage this is when the

73
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:25,769
developers start to find problems with

74
00:03:25,769 --> 00:03:28,590
the design and when problems are found

75
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:31,459
design gets passed back to the designer

76
00:03:31,459 --> 00:03:33,660
this is when the designers start to get

77
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:36,510
stressed out and start thinking about

78
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:38,370
all of the possible solutions that they

79
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:41,190
can use in order to solve the problem

80
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:44,030
and once the solution is found the

81
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:46,799
design mock-up gets updated and get

82
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:50,040
passed back to developer but it's not

83
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:52,110
the end of the story because problems

84
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:56,400
will keep on being found and the cycle

85
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,950
will just keep on repeating itself so I

86
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:02,190
have three reasons why this type of

87
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:04,680
communication actually failed during

88
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:07,440
responsive web development and the first

89
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,780
thing is limitation see designers are

90
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:12,930
creative beings I wish I can be half as

91
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:14,910
creative as them but most of the time I

92
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:17,250
only like to pretend to be a designer on

93
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:20,970
a daily basis and so whenever I look at

94
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:23,280
my designers working it impresses me

95
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,750
because there's no limitation to their

96
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:26,880
creativity but there's always going to

97
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,100
be limitation when you start developing

98
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:32,729
their ideas for example a designer may

99
00:04:32,729 --> 00:04:34,879
come to you with fancy anime

100
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:37,240
and there's always going to be

101
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,979
limitations on how this animation would

102
00:04:39,979 --> 00:04:42,529
render on smaller screen dividers - and

103
00:04:42,529 --> 00:04:45,860
and also in older browsers designers

104
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:48,229
will come to you with big images to be

105
00:04:48,229 --> 00:04:50,270
implemented on the site but there's

106
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:52,490
always going to be limitations on how

107
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:55,009
this images would affect the performance

108
00:04:55,009 --> 00:04:57,020
of your site and also the art direction

109
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:59,779
on your smaller screen devices of your

110
00:04:59,779 --> 00:05:02,889
site and designers may also come with

111
00:05:02,889 --> 00:05:05,719
beautiful and intricate layouts but

112
00:05:05,719 --> 00:05:08,539
there's always going to be limitation in

113
00:05:08,539 --> 00:05:11,209
terms of the difference in expectation

114
00:05:11,209 --> 00:05:13,909
on how this layouts supposed to render

115
00:05:13,909 --> 00:05:15,979
on smaller screen to larger screen

116
00:05:15,979 --> 00:05:19,189
devices for example my designer come up

117
00:05:19,189 --> 00:05:20,959
to me one day and show me this mock-up

118
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:23,179
this is the blueprint of the mock-up and

119
00:05:23,179 --> 00:05:25,219
how it should render on large screen

120
00:05:25,219 --> 00:05:28,039
device as you can see the episodes clips

121
00:05:28,039 --> 00:05:29,990
and trailers should appear as a sidebar

122
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:32,869
so at a glance I understand that on

123
00:05:32,869 --> 00:05:35,800
smaller screen device the sidebar should

124
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:38,539
appear right under the main content area

125
00:05:38,539 --> 00:05:40,969
and in this case the episodes clips and

126
00:05:40,969 --> 00:05:44,139
trailers should appear under collections

127
00:05:44,139 --> 00:05:47,589
but my designer has a totally different

128
00:05:47,589 --> 00:05:52,519
expectation so he expects the episodes

129
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:55,209
to appear right below the About section

130
00:05:55,209 --> 00:05:57,469
while the clips and trailers should

131
00:05:57,469 --> 00:05:59,779
appear right below collections so this

132
00:05:59,779 --> 00:06:01,219
is an example of the difference of

133
00:06:01,219 --> 00:06:04,249
expectations that you may encounter when

134
00:06:04,249 --> 00:06:05,749
you're working on such a project and

135
00:06:05,749 --> 00:06:07,189
when you're working closely with the

136
00:06:07,189 --> 00:06:10,339
designer this is the kind of

137
00:06:10,339 --> 00:06:12,289
expectations that you should communicate

138
00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:14,479
verbally to each other and that you

139
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:17,479
should not rely on markups alone to pass

140
00:06:17,479 --> 00:06:20,240
the message effectively which brings me

141
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,009
to my second reason on why such a

142
00:06:22,009 --> 00:06:24,769
communication style fail the markups

143
00:06:24,769 --> 00:06:27,139
itself mock-ups don't really tell you

144
00:06:27,139 --> 00:06:28,789
much about what's the performance of

145
00:06:28,789 --> 00:06:30,979
your site's going to be like it doesn't

146
00:06:30,979 --> 00:06:33,379
tell you much about the development

147
00:06:33,379 --> 00:06:35,569
complexity that you may run into when

148
00:06:35,569 --> 00:06:38,059
you start developing the site and most

149
00:06:38,059 --> 00:06:40,279
importantly it doesn't really tell you

150
00:06:40,279 --> 00:06:42,409
about the interaction types it's going

151
00:06:42,409 --> 00:06:45,620
to be on your site so there's this

152
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:48,080
amazing quote by Tom Maslin Tom

153
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,699
is actually a developer working on

154
00:06:51,699 --> 00:06:55,550
responsive web development at BBC I got

155
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:57,819
this quote from a book called real life

156
00:06:57,819 --> 00:07:00,710
responsive web design by Smashing

157
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:03,110
Magazine I was out earlier this year I

158
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:04,849
suggest everyone who's working on

159
00:07:04,849 --> 00:07:06,680
responsive website to read the book I

160
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:09,470
wish I stumbled upon it earlier

161
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:12,500
so basically Tom's quote summarizes that

162
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:15,050
you can't really assume that small

163
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:17,509
screen devices interaction is going to

164
00:07:17,509 --> 00:07:21,020
be done by touch while a large screen

165
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:23,300
one will be done by mouse and you would

166
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:26,000
understand where Tom is coming from if

167
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,090
you actually take an iPad visit a site

168
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:31,509
on iPad and switch it to landscape mode

169
00:07:31,509 --> 00:07:34,639
if most of it I will take the desktop

170
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:36,440
set of design and depending on your

171
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:39,530
design where your interaction type works

172
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:42,319
seamlessly on desktop it will start to

173
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:45,830
fail on the iPad landscape mode so this

174
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:48,800
is the kind of design problems that you

175
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,009
may encounter this is the kind of

176
00:07:52,009 --> 00:07:54,289
limitations that you may encounter and

177
00:07:54,289 --> 00:07:58,009
the third reason is shortcomings design

178
00:07:58,009 --> 00:08:00,409
shortcomings will be discovered really

179
00:08:00,409 --> 00:08:02,630
late and in our case it's always

180
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:04,250
discovered during the development stage

181
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:07,580
and this is when you will start thinking

182
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:09,639
about employing different kinds of hacks

183
00:08:09,639 --> 00:08:12,650
shortcuts and libraries and I don't

184
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:15,080
think she's just gonna be happy for your

185
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:17,240
code climate if you make it a habit and

186
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:20,599
also if there's any last-minute picture

187
00:08:20,599 --> 00:08:23,779
that you forgot to include it will

188
00:08:23,779 --> 00:08:25,639
actually you won't be able to squeeze it

189
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:29,000
and for example @viki we have very

190
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,719
passionate users we have users working

191
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:35,209
as volunteers to actually provide

192
00:08:35,209 --> 00:08:37,789
subtitles on the site on a daily basis

193
00:08:37,789 --> 00:08:40,579
and we actually value the opinions of

194
00:08:40,579 --> 00:08:44,209
these users because we want to make your

195
00:08:44,209 --> 00:08:45,980
job easier for them but at the same time

196
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:47,600
we want the site to be fun for them to

197
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,959
use so when we roll out the responsive

198
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:53,180
web they were complaining about a

199
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:55,430
feature that we missed out which is the

200
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:59,000
cinematic mode feature so just to walk

201
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,829
you through our previous workflow we

202
00:09:00,829 --> 00:09:01,430
have

203
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:03,890
a high fidelity design markup that we

204
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:07,580
test and validate once we go to the

205
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:09,710
development stage this is where we lost

206
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:11,300
a lot of time due to the back-and-forth

207
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:12,830
style of communicating with each other

208
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:15,140
once we start to roll it up for better

209
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:17,990
testing and ask users but their opinions

210
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:19,760
on the side this is when they start

211
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,529
suggesting feature requests that we have

212
00:09:21,529 --> 00:09:25,070
no time for so after applying some

213
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:27,320
finishing touch we decided to roll the

214
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,010
side out

215
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:30,050
but this there was a lot of backlash

216
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:33,050
from the users because we actually did

217
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:34,850
not include the cinematic mode feature

218
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:37,760
that they liked so much so initially pre

219
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,459
responsive era we had the cinematic mode

220
00:09:40,459 --> 00:09:44,420
as a default but when we actually wrote

221
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:47,000
the responsive site we no longer have

222
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,920
the cinematic mode this is when we have

223
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:51,170
a lot of criticism from our users like

224
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:53,300
the site started to look very much like

225
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:56,540
a hospital it looks too white too bright

226
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:58,399
it's really hard for me to actually

227
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:00,920
watch my shows all of these kinds of

228
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:05,750
first world problems but so this but

229
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:08,720
when but we understand after

230
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,520
interviewing the users we actually

231
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,500
understand where they are coming from

232
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:15,170
because they don't actually view this

233
00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:17,779
video on full view mode and the reason

234
00:10:17,779 --> 00:10:20,810
is because they like to multitask and

235
00:10:20,810 --> 00:10:23,630
viewing videos on full view mode there's

236
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:26,990
not allowed them to do that I know that

237
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:29,390
this problem this communication style is

238
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:31,940
just going to be more of a problem for

239
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:35,330
us in the long run so I suggested a

240
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:38,209
different way of working to my designers

241
00:10:38,209 --> 00:10:43,010
one day and after a bit of banter they

242
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:46,130
finally agree with it and it's more of a

243
00:10:46,130 --> 00:10:48,770
collaborative style of working so what

244
00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:51,200
does a collaborative workflow looks like

245
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,220
right now at viki so we have a designer

246
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:57,680
who passed in a low fidelity mock-up or

247
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:01,250
sketches to the developer and this is

248
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:02,570
where the developer would start

249
00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:07,010
prototyping the mock-up this is where

250
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:08,990
the developer would start assessing the

251
00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:10,760
problems the potential problems that

252
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:16,090
could happen with design and from this

253
00:11:16,090 --> 00:11:18,980
from these problems discovered Duvall

254
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:21,140
will start giving feedback to the

255
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:23,630
designer on what works and what doesn't

256
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:25,880
and based on this information the

257
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,830
designer would then start designing

258
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:30,350
based on constraints they would start

259
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:33,530
developing a high fidelity mock-up based

260
00:11:33,530 --> 00:11:35,360
on the constraints set by the developer

261
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,010
and we find that this is a very

262
00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:38,750
effective way of working together

263
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:41,810
because the developer is highly involved

264
00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:45,140
in the design and ultimately your design

265
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:47,810
is decided in the browser and not true

266
00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:50,480
Photoshop and the only way to access

267
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,940
your design more effectively is true

268
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:55,310
browsers because only browsers can tell

269
00:11:55,310 --> 00:11:57,140
you what kind of interaction types works

270
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:59,810
for you and if you're only solely

271
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:02,330
designed in Photoshop most of the time

272
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:04,360
you're making a lot of assumption and

273
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:08,060
then that assumption may or may not be

274
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:11,150
true and most time you will make a lot

275
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:13,910
of mistakes through that assumption when

276
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:16,280
I first suggested this style of working

277
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:18,380
there's a lot of doubts coming from my

278
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:20,080
team members because they feel that

279
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:23,540
prototyping will take a lot of time so

280
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:27,470
if you have the same concern I would say

281
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:29,570
that there's nothing to worry about

282
00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:32,450
because it's not necessary to put it up

283
00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:33,110
everything

284
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:35,810
for me what I like to put it up is I

285
00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:38,300
just like to get the layout work just

286
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:40,250
understanding how the layout would

287
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:42,410
behave on smaller screen device through

288
00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:46,370
a large screen one and also I also like

289
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:48,860
to test the interaction types seeing how

290
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:50,630
it works on smaller screen devices and

291
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:54,080
well as well and the role of prototyping

292
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,820
is I read somewhere that the rule of

293
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:58,400
prototyping should be less than an hour

294
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,470
to build and you shouldn't care much

295
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:03,740
about aesthetic the rule is to just

296
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:06,980
build fast and bill ugly and also if you

297
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:09,230
have a pattern library which we have

298
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:09,860
@viki

299
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:14,050
it'll make prototyping that much faster

300
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:17,120
so just to walk you through our new

301
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,480
workflow we have a design mock but prior

302
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,490
to that we have been prototyping and we

303
00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:25,280
have access the feasibility of the

304
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:27,360
design and then we start

305
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,149
thing it once we get to development

306
00:13:30,149 --> 00:13:31,920
stage we noticed that there's a last

307
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:35,040
time last year compared to before

308
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:38,760
because we finally know if there's a

309
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,800
problem we know about it beforehand

310
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,290
we're not surprised by it anymore and we

311
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:44,670
definitely know how to solve it this

312
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:45,240
time

313
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:47,010
and once we roll it out for better

314
00:13:47,010 --> 00:13:49,350
testing if there's any feature requests

315
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:51,209
that we can still squeeze in we will do

316
00:13:51,209 --> 00:13:54,600
it before rolling it out so I talked a

317
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:57,089
lot about losing time and as developers

318
00:13:57,089 --> 00:14:01,019
I think that one of our concern when

319
00:14:01,019 --> 00:14:04,200
we're working on big project is deadline

320
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,660
and I think deadlines could be worrying

321
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:08,250
about deadlines could be a bad thing

322
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:11,010
because you'll get really excited just

323
00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:13,260
start developing right away and that

324
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:14,640
could be a bad thing because that means

325
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:16,339
that there's a lack of planning on

326
00:14:16,339 --> 00:14:18,690
development and when there's a lack of

327
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:21,089
planning on development it would

328
00:14:21,089 --> 00:14:23,220
actually be dangerous because you will

329
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:24,990
notice that your technical depth will

330
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:27,480
start to increase and when your

331
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:29,730
technical Doug increases you need to

332
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:31,470
actually allocate time in the future to

333
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:33,839
start refactoring your code and when

334
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:36,360
you're working on a product centric

335
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,130
company like Vickie we have product

336
00:14:38,130 --> 00:14:43,350
development on a quarterly basis when we

337
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:46,470
need to allocate time for refactoring

338
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:48,600
and also allocating time for product

339
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,070
development it can get pretty

340
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:53,160
overwhelming so I was reviewing my CSS

341
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:55,199
code one day there were two other guys

342
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:57,690
writing the CSS code with me and I

343
00:14:57,690 --> 00:14:58,620
noticed that there's a lot of

344
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:01,410
inconsistency there's an inconsistent

345
00:15:01,410 --> 00:15:03,779
ways of writing media queries one file

346
00:15:03,779 --> 00:15:06,870
the media queries is written in nested

347
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:10,509
manner while the other one is

348
00:15:10,519 --> 00:15:14,459
unnecessary time in writing CSS on one

349
00:15:14,459 --> 00:15:17,399
file it is written in a mobile-first

350
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:19,829
manner and another file it's written in

351
00:15:19,829 --> 00:15:22,079
our desktop first manner which is very

352
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:24,690
inconsistent and the first thing that I

353
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:27,810
wish I had done is to actually come up

354
00:15:27,810 --> 00:15:29,910
with a coding style guide before

355
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:31,860
starting development just thinking about

356
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:34,199
naming conventions and how you're going

357
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:36,630
to organize your files and also think

358
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:39,180
about the many the nesting levels

359
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:40,000
sometimes

360
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,800
notice that some developers can get very

361
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:44,770
carried away in nesting their SAS they

362
00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:47,710
could go to five to six levels and

363
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:49,990
that's not going to be very performant

364
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:52,720
for your code and also think about how

365
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,400
you're going to write your media please

366
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:57,460
set the kind of standards on how you

367
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:59,020
should write it in order to maintain

368
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:02,740
consistency because consistency is the

369
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:06,700
key to maintainability I want to talk a

370
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:08,290
little bit about naming conventions I

371
00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:09,790
think there's a lot of paradigm out

372
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:13,030
there and it could be overwhelming to

373
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:15,910
pick which one that you're going to use

374
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:18,760
for example the top trees that I have

375
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:21,970
learned about is Bam Oro CSS and Smacks

376
00:16:21,970 --> 00:16:25,330
but ultimately it doesn't really matter

377
00:16:25,330 --> 00:16:28,660
which naming conventions you're going to

378
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:31,540
use but your team members do do care

379
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:34,300
about it and my advice is to actually

380
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:36,910
sit down with your team members decide

381
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:38,860
on which naming conventions that you

382
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:41,200
want to use and actually stick with it

383
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,480
the sticking with it is important

384
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:45,460
because don't make it up as you go along

385
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:46,960
the way because it's just going to

386
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:50,170
increase your technical depth I have

387
00:16:50,170 --> 00:16:52,210
some resources that I want to share with

388
00:16:52,210 --> 00:16:53,740
you because coming up with a coding

389
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:55,780
style guide initially can get pretty

390
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:57,550
overwhelming you may not know where to

391
00:16:57,550 --> 00:16:58,120
start

392
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:00,760
the first one is CSS guidelines by Harry

393
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:02,740
Roberts I think there's some really

394
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:04,900
amazing recommendations here

395
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:07,510
there's also if you're writing sass this

396
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:09,490
was a style guide written by Chris

397
00:17:09,490 --> 00:17:12,850
coiour I think also again amazing

398
00:17:12,850 --> 00:17:15,220
recommendations but my personal favorite

399
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:17,949
is sass guidelines by Hugo guru del I

400
00:17:17,949 --> 00:17:19,420
like this the most because he actually

401
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:21,939
includes further readings that you can

402
00:17:21,939 --> 00:17:25,180
learn more about why he recommends

403
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:29,830
certain things in a specific manner so

404
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:31,030
another thing that you need to think

405
00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:33,880
about is si you have deadlines and it's

406
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:37,000
very very tempting to just jump into

407
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,800
development straight away and one of

408
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:41,050
them is to actually quickly just use

409
00:17:41,050 --> 00:17:42,220
frameworks but the thing about

410
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:44,710
frameworks is that sometimes it has more

411
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:47,350
than what you actually need we just

412
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:50,260
contributes more to CSS blowed it will

413
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:52,850
just bloat the CSS file

414
00:17:52,850 --> 00:17:55,190
and also I found that certain frameworks

415
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:58,309
could be very opinionated and it's very

416
00:17:58,309 --> 00:18:01,250
rigid to actually override their classes

417
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:02,780
and therefore it's not that

418
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:06,169
straightforward also I noticed that it

419
00:18:06,169 --> 00:18:09,500
is important to pick the right framework

420
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,960
because an unsuitable framework can be

421
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:14,919
more harmful than no frameworks at all

422
00:18:14,919 --> 00:18:17,390
this is because with unsuitable

423
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:18,950
frameworks you're going to spend a lot

424
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:21,169
of time just taking those code out and

425
00:18:21,169 --> 00:18:23,120
rewriting everything at the end of the

426
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,250
day but this is not to say that I am

427
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:27,770
against framework 100% I think that

428
00:18:27,770 --> 00:18:30,200
there are justified reasons for you to

429
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:33,049
use CSS frameworks I just think that it

430
00:18:33,049 --> 00:18:34,700
is important to pick the right one

431
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:36,860
there's different school of thoughts to

432
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:39,049
this for example for some people

433
00:18:39,049 --> 00:18:41,210
bootstrap may not be a good framework

434
00:18:41,210 --> 00:18:43,370
but for some other people it's a good

435
00:18:43,370 --> 00:18:47,480
one so I think that ultimately you

436
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:49,700
should go with a battle-tested framework

437
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:53,900
that is well known like bootstrap or

438
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:55,970
foundation and if you decide not to use

439
00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:58,460
frameworks at all you can always learn

440
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:02,480
from it use it as a guideline so that's

441
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,970
my suggestion for you and of course when

442
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:07,460
you start working on responsive web

443
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:10,309
development you will run into different

444
00:19:10,309 --> 00:19:13,070
kinds of issues like browsers and device

445
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:17,270
issues so the best way to deal with this

446
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:19,970
early is to decide on a target browsers

447
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:22,370
and device and there are several reasons

448
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:25,250
to this first one is because you want to

449
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:27,260
know what the problem is with the

450
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:29,200
devices so for example if you decided to

451
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,270
support Android 2.3 I heard a lot of

452
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:35,240
horror stories about it so you can know

453
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,220
about the problems beforehand and you

454
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:39,440
can let your designers know about it so

455
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,360
that they can also design within that

456
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:45,230
constraint and also it is useful so that

457
00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:49,610
you can research the issues beforehand

458
00:19:49,610 --> 00:19:52,490
there's an amazing github repo called

459
00:19:52,490 --> 00:19:55,730
device box created by Scott jail I think

460
00:19:55,730 --> 00:19:57,350
it's amazing because he actually

461
00:19:57,350 --> 00:20:00,740
described some of those issues in a very

462
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:02,750
specific manner and also he actually

463
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:05,070
lists how you can reproduce this

464
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:08,970
those issues and also there's also

465
00:20:08,970 --> 00:20:10,889
suggestions on workaround on how to

466
00:20:10,889 --> 00:20:15,960
bypass those issues now of course when

467
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:18,269
it comes to device box I think the best

468
00:20:18,269 --> 00:20:20,789
way to actually deal with it is to start

469
00:20:20,789 --> 00:20:25,380
testing on device early which brings me

470
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:27,690
to my third and very last blooper of the

471
00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:30,809
day we start testing late on device and

472
00:20:30,809 --> 00:20:32,940
realize we relied too much on emulators

473
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:36,059
and the reason for that is we're too

474
00:20:36,059 --> 00:20:38,789
used to our non responsive web

475
00:20:38,789 --> 00:20:40,919
development workflow we never actually

476
00:20:40,919 --> 00:20:44,940
need to test on device before so we

477
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:48,059
didn't have the habit of testing with

478
00:20:48,059 --> 00:20:50,009
devices before but I think it's really

479
00:20:50,009 --> 00:20:52,620
important to just start device testing

480
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:54,360
early because you want to test those

481
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:56,940
interaction is the scrolling working as

482
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:59,669
expected on mobile devices is touch

483
00:20:59,669 --> 00:21:00,960
working as expected

484
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,850
does a drop down disappear when you

485
00:21:02,850 --> 00:21:04,710
click outside of the drop down things

486
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:08,009
like that and also certain bugs and

487
00:21:08,009 --> 00:21:10,230
quirks only happens on mobile and

488
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:13,559
sometimes specific device I have this

489
00:21:13,559 --> 00:21:15,990
really weird bug that happened only on

490
00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:18,389
Sony Xperia I can't really remember the

491
00:21:18,389 --> 00:21:20,820
version but when a user actually visited

492
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:24,330
a video page and started viewing the

493
00:21:24,330 --> 00:21:28,139
video in full view mode and once they

494
00:21:28,139 --> 00:21:30,419
actually copped out and go back to the

495
00:21:30,419 --> 00:21:32,940
normal mode the site actually zoom in

496
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:35,909
into the nav bar but we actually noticed

497
00:21:35,909 --> 00:21:39,539
this kind of late because we didn't get

498
00:21:39,539 --> 00:21:41,970
into the habit of testing on devices

499
00:21:41,970 --> 00:21:47,039
early so I think it's important to think

500
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:50,009
about your workflow I think it is

501
00:21:50,009 --> 00:21:53,639
important to include testing on devices

502
00:21:53,639 --> 00:21:56,669
as frequently as possible so this how my

503
00:21:56,669 --> 00:21:59,309
previous workflow look like I will build

504
00:21:59,309 --> 00:22:01,379
all of the UI components in a particular

505
00:22:01,379 --> 00:22:03,809
page then I'll deploy the staging and

506
00:22:03,809 --> 00:22:06,840
then I start to test it but this is at

507
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:08,580
the end of the development this is where

508
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:10,889
I find a lot of tree build bugs on

509
00:22:10,889 --> 00:22:13,169
mobile which I could have fixed earlier

510
00:22:13,169 --> 00:22:16,289
if I knew about it earlier so I kind of

511
00:22:16,289 --> 00:22:19,200
changed the workflow to be better in a

512
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,480
that I will just build a UI component

513
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:24,450
and I will connect my local deaf

514
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:26,220
environments in my mobile phones there's

515
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:28,610
a lot of way to do that via IP address

516
00:22:28,610 --> 00:22:31,320
and this is where I find a lot of

517
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:34,200
trivial box where I can then fix it

518
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:37,320
immediately right so repeating it off

519
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:40,200
after developing all of the others UI

520
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:43,920
elements once I actually deployed the

521
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:46,380
staging and start testing it I noticed

522
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:51,060
that there are no longer too much

523
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:53,310
trivial box I can focus on the major

524
00:22:53,310 --> 00:22:55,950
ones and so I know that sometimes we

525
00:22:55,950 --> 00:22:58,260
have non-trivial back-end for some of

526
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:01,110
you you guys may use you guys may work

527
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:03,930
with third-party web services then

528
00:23:03,930 --> 00:23:06,330
connecting to mobile may not be as easy

529
00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:08,130
there's two tools that would like to

530
00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:10,110
introduce you guys one his local tunnel

531
00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:12,720
another one is proxy local it actually

532
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:16,230
creates a poxy of your local environment

533
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:19,920
and makes it available on the Internet

534
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:23,340
my and you can actually assess your

535
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:26,970
access your your site through local

536
00:23:26,970 --> 00:23:29,430
turned out on other devices my only

537
00:23:29,430 --> 00:23:32,240
complaint is that it can be really slow

538
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:37,770
now testing on testing on devices every

539
00:23:37,770 --> 00:23:39,300
time can be very overwhelming especially

540
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:42,330
if you have a lot of devices so

541
00:23:42,330 --> 00:23:44,700
sometimes whenever I look at how my

542
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:46,740
product managers are my QA engineers

543
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:48,750
test the site it could be very painful

544
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:51,240
to watch because they will actually test

545
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:53,850
one by one on iPhone and then they'll

546
00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:56,100
test another time repeat the same thing

547
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:58,140
on Android and then test it again on

548
00:23:58,140 --> 00:23:59,690
desktop it's just very repetitive

549
00:23:59,690 --> 00:24:02,220
there's a a tool that I would like to

550
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:04,500
introduce you guys is called girls lab

551
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:06,750
ghost lab actually allows you to

552
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:10,830
simultaneously test on multiple devices

553
00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:14,910
and you can actually just access your

554
00:24:14,910 --> 00:24:17,730
site on one device and whatever actions

555
00:24:17,730 --> 00:24:19,410
that you do on that particular device

556
00:24:19,410 --> 00:24:22,170
will get repeated on all of these other

557
00:24:22,170 --> 00:24:25,260
devices that you think through ghost lab

558
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:28,070
and it just really makes testing

559
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:32,350
manually much more enjoyable

560
00:24:32,350 --> 00:24:36,130
and the thing about responsive web that

561
00:24:36,130 --> 00:24:39,190
I think you need to do as well as in

562
00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:41,260
terms of testing it's important to start

563
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:43,750
researching the kinds of tool that will

564
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:46,420
make testing easier and this is when we

565
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:48,010
can start thinking about visual

566
00:24:48,010 --> 00:24:50,770
regression tools visual regression tools

567
00:24:50,770 --> 00:24:53,890
can actually allow you to compare two

568
00:24:53,890 --> 00:24:56,230
different screenshots and actually find

569
00:24:56,230 --> 00:24:57,880
the difference between those two

570
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:00,520
screenshots this allows you to kind of

571
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:02,200
test your CSS a little bit better

572
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:05,170
the thing about CSS is breaking it is

573
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:07,960
very easy but testing it is very very

574
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:11,350
hard and so I come across this visually

575
00:25:11,350 --> 00:25:13,990
regreted regression to a car race race

576
00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:15,760
is actually developed by the amazing

577
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:20,020
folks at BBC what it does is that you

578
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:23,170
can actually take two different screen

579
00:25:23,170 --> 00:25:24,820
shots for example screenshot of your

580
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:27,340
local environment and compare it to the

581
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:28,930
screenshot of your production

582
00:25:28,930 --> 00:25:31,240
environment and it will spit out a

583
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:33,580
difference between those two screenshots

584
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:35,830
of it you can pinpoint the error and

585
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:37,630
what I like the most about width is that

586
00:25:37,630 --> 00:25:40,000
it actually creates a gallery that lists

587
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,800
all of your screenshots and it

588
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:44,590
categorizes it based on the screen size

589
00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:48,220
and this is an example of a section so

590
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:50,500
as you can see we have one screenshot

591
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:51,970
that I took from my local environment

592
00:25:51,970 --> 00:25:54,700
and the other one is from my production

593
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:56,530
environment I will pinpoint the

594
00:25:56,530 --> 00:25:58,390
percentage of difference the third

595
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:00,820
images of a point up the percentage of

596
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:02,740
difference of these two screenshots and

597
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:06,690
if the error exceeds a certain number of

598
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:09,850
percentage in our case it's 20 percent

599
00:26:09,850 --> 00:26:13,150
it will spit out an error this is a cool

600
00:26:13,150 --> 00:26:14,650
thing as well because you can actually

601
00:26:14,650 --> 00:26:18,100
control the sensitivity of your test you

602
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:20,560
can make it less than.this sensitive or

603
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:23,260
more sensitive for example we set it up

604
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:26,500
to 20 percent any any kind of difference

605
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:29,410
that exceeds that will spit out an error

606
00:26:29,410 --> 00:26:33,640
and as you can see the third screenshot

607
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:35,440
what it does that is superimposes

608
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,560
two of these images together and

609
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:39,580
highlights the difference in blue in

610
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:41,260
this case it's just difference in ads so

611
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:44,360
it's not a big deal

612
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:47,130
but the thing about visual regression

613
00:26:47,130 --> 00:26:49,380
tool is that it's not perfect during my

614
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:51,660
short time of using it I encountered

615
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:54,180
several problems for example it doesn't

616
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:57,860
really render lazy loaded items as

617
00:26:57,860 --> 00:27:00,030
effectively as I thought it's going to

618
00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:02,970
be and because of that it generates a

619
00:27:02,970 --> 00:27:05,550
lot of false positives where it part it

620
00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:09,210
has an error when it is not an error at

621
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:12,720
all and another thing is it can be very

622
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:15,000
slow depending on how many screenshots

623
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:19,320
that you are taking so I have several

624
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:22,320
suggestions on how to handle those the

625
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,480
first thing is regarding lazy loaded

626
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,100
items and false positive there is a

627
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:29,340
setting actually this a setting about a

628
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:32,330
timeout that you can increase so that

629
00:27:32,330 --> 00:27:37,020
the snapshot with the snapshot process

630
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:39,360
is delayed this will wait for all of

631
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:41,610
your lazy loaded items to be rendered

632
00:27:41,610 --> 00:27:45,030
before taking this snapshot and another

633
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:47,610
thing is if you have lazy loaded images

634
00:27:47,610 --> 00:27:50,240
that will only appear if you scroll down

635
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:53,309
another thing is there's a settings and

636
00:27:53,309 --> 00:27:55,050
options under a setting called browser

637
00:27:55,050 --> 00:27:57,390
height where you can increase it just to

638
00:27:57,390 --> 00:27:59,490
make sure that it scroll all the way and

639
00:27:59,490 --> 00:28:02,370
every images gets rendered as expected

640
00:28:02,370 --> 00:28:05,910
in terms of slow I'm still working on it

641
00:28:05,910 --> 00:28:09,600
but one of the things that I think we

642
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,520
should do is to just a limit testing

643
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:14,880
just test critical pages for example at

644
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,559
Vicky's one of the most critical pages

645
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:19,770
for us is our video page this is where

646
00:28:19,770 --> 00:28:21,900
we wanted this is a page that we want to

647
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:25,950
test all the time but perhaps other

648
00:28:25,950 --> 00:28:28,290
non-critical pages like say your about

649
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:31,020
page or a static landing page this is

650
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:33,809
something that perhaps you may not care

651
00:28:33,809 --> 00:28:35,730
so much about perhaps it's not important

652
00:28:35,730 --> 00:28:38,730
for you to test so we're not completely

653
00:28:38,730 --> 00:28:42,390
done yet the responsive web project has

654
00:28:42,390 --> 00:28:44,700
only been going on for about more or

655
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:46,620
less three months now and we still have

656
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:50,010
a lot of work to do it's still a work in

657
00:28:50,010 --> 00:28:50,760
progress

658
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:53,850
and I think that I'm pretty sure I will

659
00:28:53,850 --> 00:28:55,520
find more bloopers

660
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:57,380
the way and I think maybe this talk

661
00:28:57,380 --> 00:29:01,640
should have a sequel and but that's what

662
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:04,040
I have for you and I just want to say

663
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:09,330
thank you for your attention today

664
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:14,059
thank you how many devices do you pick

665
00:29:14,059 --> 00:29:17,300
for your test and like you know is there

666
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:19,940
any good criteria of like which device

667
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:24,290
we should pick we actually use data

668
00:29:24,290 --> 00:29:28,280
analytics to actually test to actually

669
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:30,770
pick our devices we have a list of

670
00:29:30,770 --> 00:29:33,140
device that we are choosing from but I

671
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:35,420
think the best strategy that we use is

672
00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:38,150
actually we have a diverse of device

673
00:29:38,150 --> 00:29:41,090
when it comes to our staff members and

674
00:29:41,090 --> 00:29:43,580
we actually tell them to test it on

675
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:45,830
their devices as well that's how we

676
00:29:45,830 --> 00:29:48,650
actually found the Sony Xperia bug which

677
00:29:48,650 --> 00:29:49,610
is pretty random

678
00:29:49,610 --> 00:29:52,059
so there's actually kind of in-house

679
00:29:52,059 --> 00:29:54,890
testing but my suggestion to that is

680
00:29:54,890 --> 00:29:58,040
actually go through your data analytics

681
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:01,070
to see what devices is popular amongst
