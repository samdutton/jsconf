00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:11,090

ah

2
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:14,379
pirating the YQL way this is a really

3
00:00:14,379 --> 00:00:17,500
random talk title in fact Chris asked me

4
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:18,760
to do something is like yeah that sounds

5
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:21,100
good so let's start with some pirate

6
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:26,140
jokes who likes pirates say are that was

7
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:32,470
rubbish say are much better what did the

8
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:34,300
pirate say when his wooden leg got stuck

9
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:44,170
in the freezer shiver me timbers No so

10
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:46,570
the point of this talk other than

11
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:48,699
telling incredibly crap pirate jokes

12
00:00:48,699 --> 00:00:50,050
which will be liberally scared through

13
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:52,870
the talk it's about plundering the seven

14
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:55,269
seas of data so the web is this really

15
00:00:55,269 --> 00:00:57,309
interesting wonderful thing and it's

16
00:00:57,309 --> 00:01:00,609
it's full of data there's data

17
00:01:00,609 --> 00:01:02,800
absolutely everywhere there's all these

18
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,120
kind of interesting stuff that we could

19
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:06,610
just access if only it was a little bit

20
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:09,280
more in touch so my entire talk is

21
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,770
actually a man standing a computer type

22
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:14,170
of stuff this is what all hackathons

23
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:15,820
would be like would be like this in real

24
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:18,160
life you know there's no Angelina Jolie

25
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:20,680
there's me sitting there typing stuff

26
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:24,070
into a computer beard man that's right

27
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:27,520
thank you Brian so this is why ql hands

28
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:28,750
up people that use wake you at all

29
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:33,370
before few people okay good so for

30
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:34,540
everybody else I'm going to do a short

31
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:36,070
demo and then I'm going to explain how

32
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:37,600
this is even slightly relevant to

33
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,810
JavaScript so to start with hands up

34
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:43,990
people that use SQL right you'll know

35
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:46,420
why ql to a greater or lesser extent

36
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:50,050
show tables has given me a list of all

37
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:53,080
the tables and right now that's this is

38
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:55,180
all Yahoo stuff which is you know some

39
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:56,680
of this stuff school some of it you know

40
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:59,710
maybe you don't care but if I click on

41
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:01,900
the show community tables we don't have

42
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:05,680
this great list down the side and this

43
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,090
is every table that anybody's ever

44
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:09,459
committed and it's really good because

45
00:02:09,459 --> 00:02:12,190
we suddenly have access to a kajillion

46
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:15,939
sets of data or 737 if you really want

47
00:02:15,939 --> 00:02:18,609
to push me let me make the font big

48
00:02:18,609 --> 00:02:19,010
resort

49
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:22,400
people a bit too big you're not your

50
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,390
grandma so if we want to do something

51
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:28,099
with this let's actually start using it

52
00:02:28,099 --> 00:02:30,620
so select star from search dot where

53
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:32,299
anybody care to guess what search that

54
00:02:32,299 --> 00:02:36,829
web does thank you sir it searches the

55
00:02:36,829 --> 00:02:40,849
web stand up who is that this guy stand

56
00:02:40,849 --> 00:02:43,010
up that man's want a t-shirt for

57
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:44,629
answering the most obvious question the

58
00:02:44,629 --> 00:02:47,720
whole talk come and simulator will get

59
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:50,209
your t-shirt so what do we want to

60
00:02:50,209 --> 00:02:52,849
search the web for not Brian everybody

61
00:02:52,849 --> 00:02:54,200
but Brian can answer this what do we

62
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:57,019
want to search the web for pirates all

63
00:02:57,019 --> 00:03:01,040
right there you go if I can smell and

64
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,470
what a query equals pirates and this is

65
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:05,629
the thing is I'm such a ham-fisted

66
00:03:05,629 --> 00:03:07,670
drunkard if I can use the system

67
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:09,409
basically everybody in the whole world

68
00:03:09,409 --> 00:03:12,709
can use the system so we run this it

69
00:03:12,709 --> 00:03:14,569
goes to a web service and it fetches a

70
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:16,400
bunch of results about pirates hands up

71
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,260
people that use yahoo web search really

72
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:24,769
awesome thanks guys you're like making

73
00:03:24,769 --> 00:03:26,180
my money but you know hands up people

74
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:29,329
that use google web search all right so

75
00:03:29,329 --> 00:03:31,449
let's go in search google table instead

76
00:03:31,449 --> 00:03:36,470
because you know this isn't about you

77
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:38,359
know i was constrained to any particular

78
00:03:38,359 --> 00:03:41,510
thing it's about us kind of allowing you

79
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:42,889
to access web services in a really

80
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:44,510
meaningful way so we clicked on the

81
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:47,389
table it's given us an easy default this

82
00:03:47,389 --> 00:03:49,160
is like a sample thing that you could

83
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:51,260
run so we obviously in this case would

84
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:54,199
change from pizza to pirates or ninjas

85
00:03:54,199 --> 00:03:55,790
at such a ninja's just to give it a bit

86
00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:59,510
of balance the force so and then you've

87
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:01,160
got some Google search results so the

88
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,750
point of this system is that we've got

89
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:05,870
some really interesting ways interesting

90
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:08,599
and easy ways to get access to this web

91
00:04:08,599 --> 00:04:11,930
data right and you can start to mix it

92
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:14,389
up so people will use Flickr most people

93
00:04:14,389 --> 00:04:20,479
use Flickr so let's do some searches

94
00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:24,040
just stuff pirates this awesome

95
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:30,990
where c 10 t pirates awesome okay so

96
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:33,000
we've got this stuff this is kind of

97
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,230
interesting we've got a bunch of pirates

98
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:36,540
but does anybody know how to manually

99
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:39,000
key urls just off the top of the head

100
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:48,020
and that's probably my cell phone classy

101
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:51,150
so nobody knows how to construct these

102
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:52,380
for the key URLs off the top of their

103
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:53,850
heads because it's kind of obtuse but

104
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:55,560
what you can do instead is if we take

105
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,480
one of these IDs and I'm going to copy

106
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,400
it I'm going to paste it in here so

107
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:03,500
select star from flickered off flickr

108
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:08,220
photos dot info where ID he calls this

109
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:14,000
and i think photo ID so it's helping me

110
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,400
not it up there we go right so this

111
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,680
is the thing and if we click on this

112
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,390
here okay wasn't my phone somebody

113
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:22,919
else's phone everybody throw their

114
00:05:22,919 --> 00:05:28,169
phones on the floor no all right so i

115
00:05:28,169 --> 00:05:30,419
don't know well I guess it's got a skull

116
00:05:30,419 --> 00:05:33,300
and crossbones that's rubbish I'm not

117
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:34,650
impressed with that pirate picture but

118
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:38,370
you know so let's get the rest so can

119
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:39,960
anybody guess let's use SQL what we're

120
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,640
going to do in order to among these two

121
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:45,750
things together in a queries did

122
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:48,180
somebody say sub selects no nobody said

123
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:50,750
sub selects its to select star from

124
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:58,640
flickr doc photos search wait yeah we're

125
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:05,220
text equals pirates okay that gets as a

126
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:06,960
bunch of stuff but what we really want

127
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,310
is we want the idea is to feed into hit

128
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:10,650
so let's do in this like that that's

129
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:12,870
going to break because it doesn't want

130
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:21,210
that it once 10 photos thank you perfect

131
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:24,300
so now we have the information from all

132
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:26,640
10 of the photos so instead of that

133
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,970
single URL which is really annoying

134
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:31,680
we've now got the whole information from

135
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,140
everything which is great right this is

136
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:35,580
this is starting to get really useful

137
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:37,550
now obviously I know how much ever

138
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:39,470
enjoys looking xml so let's switch up

139
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:42,410
let's go to Jason and this is where YQL

140
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:44,330
starts to get really useful because

141
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:46,670
suddenly you've got and I guess people

142
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:48,740
can probably see immediately this isn't

143
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:51,560
jason this is actually Jason P so you

144
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:54,550
can wrap whatever function you want

145
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:59,390
around this and you can use that in

146
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:01,490
order to get this straight into a web

147
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:03,920
application and this jquery plugins

148
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:06,410
there's dojo plugins there's Yui plugins

149
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:08,540
there's a node plugin there's a node

150
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:10,730
module that somebody made right this is

151
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:12,500
absolutely everywhere and if you need to

152
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:15,140
get any kind of web services it's bang

153
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:17,510
on so what is you know what does it have

154
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:19,220
to do with JavaScript let's that's kind

155
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:21,130
of dig into that a little bit deeper

156
00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:23,380
does anybody do anything for pirate day

157
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:25,550
this is what I did for Pirate Day last

158
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:28,670
year this is a blog post and I basically

159
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:31,370
decided it can I sucked the web wasn't

160
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:35,840
partying up it's good photo isn't it you

161
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:39,740
never see me on a weekend amazing so

162
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:41,120
it's like what can we do to make the web

163
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,250
more piratey so I built this little

164
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:45,560
bookmarklet using wake you out and i'm

165
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,240
going to show you now the problem is is

166
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:49,730
that it works best when you pick

167
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:52,070
websites with lots of texts but with

168
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:55,550
small words or easy words so let's go to

169
00:07:55,550 --> 00:08:00,990
fox news

170
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,400
right and I'm gonna cheat a little bit

171
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,650
because I wanted to know he'd been

172
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:09,889
playing with with the story about the

173
00:08:09,889 --> 00:08:11,690
story about the volcano because i'm

174
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:13,669
going to show you my system but you know

175
00:08:13,669 --> 00:08:15,350
i was playing with this story earlier so

176
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:17,210
here's here's this story about this

177
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:18,860
volcano and you know the big cloud of

178
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:21,260
ash and i really really really like the

179
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:24,500
name i'm going to run it yeah oh ya you

180
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:27,110
look all sounds great what an awesome

181
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:31,310
name for a volcano so i clicked my

182
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:34,130
pirate ice bookmark and it now reads so

183
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:36,010
let me let me read the the first version

184
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:38,810
the first version reads you know blah

185
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:40,580
blah blah blah blah site scientists say

186
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:42,280
that because the volcano is situated

187
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:45,500
below a glacial ice cap the magma is

188
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,540
being called quickly causing explosions

189
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:49,160
blah blah blah you know there's all of

190
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:51,370
this stuff so that's prioritize that so

191
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:53,690
how I'm doing this is really quite

192
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:56,510
simple magicians say that because the

193
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:59,210
volcano be situated below a glacial ice

194
00:08:59,210 --> 00:09:02,140
cap you're under magma be cooled quickly

195
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:05,150
it's really it's really quite stupid but

196
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:07,070
you know how did I do that what was that

197
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:12,140
what was the thing I did so um here's a

198
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:15,350
table that I built in yql it's connected

199
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:17,060
to some cloud storage so you can insert

200
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:19,400
stuff and store stuff it's it's a key

201
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:22,510
value store it's not yeah it's not

202
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:24,530
whatever but you can see that what I did

203
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:26,480
was I swapped the word plane for ship

204
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,430
pirates don't have friggin planes who

205
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:30,800
have heard that you know so pirates have

206
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,720
ships so that's sort the word planes to

207
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,540
ships and I can also take this table

208
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:37,520
that I did and you can see actually this

209
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:38,750
is a really interesting feature of like

210
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:41,450
oil is I'm not just selecting data yto

211
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:43,339
lets you insert later as well so this is

212
00:09:43,339 --> 00:09:44,720
one of the really key features is that

213
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,510
it's a full can SQ i'll set but let's

214
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:51,050
select star from that instead well from

215
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:55,190
from so start from pie recipe go to

216
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:58,010
shrink and this is my list of pirate

217
00:09:58,010 --> 00:10:00,650
words what's awesome this site is live

218
00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:03,740
right so if you i'm going to give you

219
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:05,030
some instructions in a minute but if you

220
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:09,020
all go here then you also can add pirate

221
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:11,150
terms and the dictionary would get

222
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:11,880
better with all

223
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,580
some pirate terms so let's part it up

224
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:18,000
why is pirating addictive because once

225
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,150
you lose your first hand you get hooked

226
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:26,460
zing so how does this work basically

227
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:28,950
what I've done is this is the same URL

228
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:30,630
we had before and this is incredibly

229
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:35,820
easy to read font I like one through all

230
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:37,080
the fonts on my macros like yeah that

231
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:41,310
one looks like pirate font so its

232
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:43,740
developer dot yahoo.com / yq l / console

233
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:45,630
so this is this easy console I've been

234
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:47,430
demoing and then I've added to the end

235
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:50,250
of it this environment file EMV equals

236
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:52,230
stall bloody bloody bar and basically

237
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:55,020
what this does is this tells yql to load

238
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:58,200
a bunch of extra tables so I click and

239
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:01,110
i'm going to get my thing and now you

240
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:02,730
can see that I've got this extra table

241
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:04,770
called pirate speak and we've got a

242
00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:05,970
dictionary and then I've also got the

243
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:09,390
translator and actually what the what

244
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:10,890
the bookmarklet was doing was it was

245
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:14,340
calling this translation using JSONP and

246
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,930
then it was replacing all of the text on

247
00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:17,460
the page so it was just in a giant inner

248
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:22,260
HTML on the whole page so let's have a

249
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:23,940
look at this I Minister what we're doing

250
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:25,200
you know we're taking some text or

251
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,840
translating it hello friend I'm a mighty

252
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,040
pirate looking for a good woman do you

253
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,570
know where the nearest bar is to the

254
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:32,580
left of the right ahoy mate mighty

255
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:33,900
pirate looking for a good wench and so

256
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:35,880
on and so forth and all of these words

257
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:39,090
are getting drawn from this dictionary

258
00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:41,580
that we've got so let's start looking at

259
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:43,020
some code codes more interesting than

260
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:49,920
the other stuff so let's see okay make

261
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,440
this a lot bigger so why care all of

262
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,720
these tables all of this stuff that

263
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,870
we've got if I show the community tables

264
00:11:57,870 --> 00:11:59,760
so we're looking at at the beginning

265
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,410
whichever tablet sent all of these

266
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:03,570
tables are contributed by other people

267
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:06,120
the one to get a particular web service

268
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:08,490
and anybody can just write these and

269
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:10,680
this is the one that I wrote in order to

270
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,720
do the pirate stuff and this is where it

271
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,830
gets really interesting because we're

272
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:15,840
actually running on the server all of

273
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:18,870
this is a clear I know so we're using

274
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:21,420
rhino you've got JavaScript 1.8 and we

275
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:23,640
possibly have the only legitimate use in

276
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:25,740
the whole world of e for

277
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:28,960
because I really personally Haiti for X

278
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,880
quite a lot but when you have to work

279
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:34,320
with XML it's fairly helpful so

280
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:37,720
essentially what this table does and you

281
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,430
can see so let's let's break it down a

282
00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:43,090
little bit the you can see that we've

283
00:12:43,090 --> 00:12:44,710
got some keys so when I'm selecting

284
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:48,550
stuff from these tables I've got key

285
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:51,580
HTML I'm passing that in and then

286
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:53,620
there's some other keys so there's a

287
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:55,270
selects already that's actually getting

288
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:57,490
passed through automatically for me and

289
00:12:57,490 --> 00:12:59,200
there's a couple of times I could also

290
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,270
have passed in a URL and in the case of

291
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:03,580
the URL it does essentially the same

292
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:06,970
thing but instead of getting the HTML

293
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:10,390
passed in it goes and fetches it using

294
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:12,610
the web server so it's doing this rest

295
00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:14,950
call to go and fetch it and bring it in

296
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:17,560
and pass it into all of that you know

297
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:19,030
the JavaScript's fairly simple I'm

298
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:22,180
tokenizing the whole page so I'm getting

299
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:24,880
every dollar Dom element tokenizing it

300
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:27,730
down into single pieces I then find the

301
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:29,800
content so this is all the stuff in the

302
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:33,400
middle of tags there's actual words pass

303
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,230
them out put them into single word

304
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:36,640
tokens and then just go through my

305
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,770
dictionary and replace find a word

306
00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:40,480
replace it find a word replace it you

307
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,760
know it's not a perfect approach but it

308
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:44,410
you know it worked for half an hour on a

309
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:48,070
Saturday so you know what can you say so

310
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:50,140
that's you know that's a really nice way

311
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:52,150
of being able to do something really

312
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:54,610
random and crazy and it's great because

313
00:13:54,610 --> 00:13:56,290
all of this is running in your whose

314
00:13:56,290 --> 00:13:57,880
cloud I don't have to host any of this

315
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,980
you know the only thing I'm doing is is

316
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:01,780
the bookmarklet literally includes a

317
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:03,670
script which just runs this and that's

318
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:06,550
it so it's incredibly simple so the

319
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:09,760
bookmarklet looks something like like

320
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,950
that so all this literally does creates

321
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:14,200
the script and then that includes

322
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:18,670
somewhere mmm don't I put the script I

323
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:21,130
guess I closed it but that just includes

324
00:14:21,130 --> 00:14:22,480
wake you out so let me find that real

325
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:25,330
quick now we could just open it show off

326
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:29,380
the website and this is the thing so YQL

327
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:32,530
is just so easy to access so that's that

328
00:14:32,530 --> 00:14:37,640
looks like this all I do is I crate

329
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:41,210
the query which is that so the URL of

330
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:46,940
the page I call the URL I include it's a

331
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:48,650
script and Bob's your uncle it's just

332
00:14:48,650 --> 00:14:51,680
jason p right so this is me doing

333
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,180
something really spirits right i mean

334
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:54,590
obviously you don't need to translate

335
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:56,480
everybody's pages to pirate but if you

336
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,980
wanted to get access to a web service

337
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:01,910
it's the same ease and simplicity so

338
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:03,800
although i do advocate dorking around

339
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:07,190
with fox news that's obviously that's

340
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:10,130
obviously worth it let's see I had

341
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:11,750
something else going to talk about all

342
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:13,460
right so yeah to give you an example of

343
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:15,070
kind of other stuff that you can create

344
00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:17,030
pirate jokes and i'm getting all my

345
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:19,760
pirate jokes of off this website called

346
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:23,270
pirate jokes Donette you know i know

347
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:24,380
right it's like who would have thought

348
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:26,330
you know i searched a pirate jokes and

349
00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:27,920
jokes up net and a particular like this

350
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:40,880
and if it's going to work are you don't

351
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,560
mean this is possibly the best song on

352
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:46,250
the internet but you know i was like

353
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:51,170
booop he's a pop-up pirate indeed so I

354
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:52,760
want these jokes and it's like war you

355
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,170
know why don't I just knock up a table

356
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:55,700
to go and get them and actually somebody

357
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:57,770
was like you should do that in the break

358
00:15:57,770 --> 00:16:00,020
so far wherever you are thank you this

359
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:01,850
is a really quick table that I knocked

360
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:04,580
up that pulls all the jokes out of out

361
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:05,720
of that and I have it queued up

362
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:08,060
somewhere there we go so you can see

363
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:10,510
that i'm using a used statement so use

364
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:14,060
HTTP kid 666 comments made my domain and

365
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:15,590
not even my parents when I was a bit

366
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:18,770
younger whatever their it annoys my wife

367
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:22,550
so it's still working and I've included

368
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:24,770
the pirate jokes XML that I made so this

369
00:16:24,770 --> 00:16:27,890
is this XML as pirate jokes and then I

370
00:16:27,890 --> 00:16:29,480
can select star from pirate jokes and

371
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:30,950
it's gone off when it's got me some of

372
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:32,780
the jokes some of these is really

373
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:34,550
terrible though why do seagulls fly over

374
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:36,350
the sea because if they flew over the

375
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:39,890
bay they'd be bagels I mean yeah I know

376
00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:43,460
right yeah whoever wrote that should be

377
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:46,430
shot make them walk the gangplank you

378
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:49,640
know so yeah so some of these jokes are

379
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:51,230
really quite terrible but

380
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:53,420
the point is that it took me you know in

381
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:56,690
order to get that really fast I used

382
00:16:56,690 --> 00:16:58,670
some CSS selectors so i can just a

383
00:16:58,670 --> 00:17:01,430
scrape the page i use some CSS selectors

384
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:02,990
right here so you can see that i pulled

385
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:06,890
out the joke set up Doug downs the

386
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:09,140
elements that I wanted and then simply

387
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:11,570
constructed some XML iterated over it

388
00:17:11,570 --> 00:17:13,520
and create the XML which comes out in

389
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,860
that format so creating these tables is

390
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:18,230
really simple and it just allows you to

391
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:19,400
do all kinds of weird and wonderful

392
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:22,490
things so what's called a pirate with

393
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:29,400
two eyes and two legs a rookie hey no

394
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:31,520
I'm running super fester date so that

395
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,260
was actually it wow that was really

396
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:36,950
short try yq i will make something

397
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:41,870
awesome and yeah questions I guess I did

398
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:47,930
that really fast yes that's a great

399
00:17:47,930 --> 00:17:49,250
question so the question is what about

400
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:51,980
authentic aid restful web services let's

401
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:54,200
do netflix who wants to see my netflix

402
00:17:54,200 --> 00:18:02,590
login details yay net net net flix Jesus

403
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:06,770
somewhere alright so yeah you can do all

404
00:18:06,770 --> 00:18:08,510
kinds of things and this is this is why

405
00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:10,370
it's really awesome having JavaScript on

406
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:11,840
the server because we were talking about

407
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,460
how are we going to you know how we're

408
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:15,200
going to make it extensible so that will

409
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,460
work with more web services because

410
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:19,250
obviously I've written this is true I've

411
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:22,160
written an xml RPC library in JavaScript

412
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:25,430
and a soap library in JavaScript so that

413
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:29,150
you don't have to write nobody wants to

414
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:35,510
do that and I did because I'm foolish so

415
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:38,570
let me just look I'm real quick yes my

416
00:18:38,570 --> 00:18:44,240
password is star star star star star or

417
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,890
rain rain rain rain rain because i'm

418
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:47,750
using a mac um so these are my our

419
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:50,150
credentials have people used both people

420
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:51,950
familiar with OAuth if you're not for a

421
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:53,210
move I will you should get familiar

422
00:18:53,210 --> 00:18:55,040
quick because Twitter about to turn off

423
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:56,870
the basic auth and at that point you

424
00:18:56,870 --> 00:18:58,280
will not be able to use the Twitter API

425
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:00,740
without knowing off so it's a good

426
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:02,150
reason to get familiar and you can see

427
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:04,060
that we actually have

428
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:05,770
if it turn on the community tables let's

429
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:09,160
do that somewhere there is a netflix

430
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:15,730
table and you can indeed access netflix

431
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:19,540
using OAuth using the table so we've

432
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:21,130
done the description it's told us i need

433
00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:25,210
a term as ckn SEK so let's select star

434
00:19:25,210 --> 00:19:31,300
from that wire see k equals that and ck

435
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:33,250
s which stands for consumer keen

436
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:38,450
consumer key secret basically these

437
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:41,350
inside the brackets term anybody want to

438
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:45,520
give me a term for a movie pirates yeah

439
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:50,200
alright original there sir alright I'm

440
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,730
going to copy that I need to sew and

441
00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:53,590
this table is enforcing HTTPS which is

442
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:56,650
fairly sensible given that it's

443
00:19:56,650 --> 00:19:58,810
accessing stuff with secret someone on

444
00:19:58,810 --> 00:20:00,400
so yeah there we go Bob's your uncle

445
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,170
you've got that and we can actually look

446
00:20:02,170 --> 00:20:04,960
at the source of the table 2 or of the

447
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:10,270
hell netflix has gone again you do and

448
00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:12,070
yeah i mean it's you know it's fairly

449
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:14,890
standard JavaScript come on Chrome there

450
00:20:14,890 --> 00:20:18,400
we go it just includes the OL fibrous

451
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,250
straight off google code runs them and

452
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:23,950
then just some old signatures its to

453
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:25,390
like this but you can do three leg as

454
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:29,410
well so if it's not until my dad vs in

455
00:20:29,410 --> 00:20:30,520
table what about

456
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:34,540
build it proprietary some somebody just

457
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:36,250
has that web services not totally

458
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:39,760
exposed to everybody we see where you

459
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:40,720
can use it I mean you don't have to put

460
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:45,940
in the tables so you saw you know oh it

461
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:50,650
just randomly went off wow this is what

462
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:51,910
happens when your own flash people it

463
00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:55,030
just takes over so yeah you can see that

464
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:57,430
you know I mean to be honest yeah

465
00:20:57,430 --> 00:20:59,440
loading stuff off kid 666 calm is not an

466
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,900
incredibly you know legitimate place to

467
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:05,110
host content but you know it works for

468
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:07,000
me so you can just include any domain

469
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,810
the other thing is these environment cut

470
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:12,640
these environment files you know you can

471
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:13,930
set those yourself you can just make

472
00:21:13,930 --> 00:21:16,150
your own and host it somewhere and it's

473
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:17,380
just got all of your stuff in and not

474
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:20,770
anybody else's so yeah any other

475
00:21:20,770 --> 00:21:22,300
questions this question is a normal

476
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:25,420
session cookies yes it does cookies how

477
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:26,890
does it make you pull in the information

478
00:21:26,890 --> 00:21:28,900
vibrations or web pages of using the

479
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:31,660
yahoo local store and never page like I

480
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:32,360
have

481
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:36,720
Eliza right so the question is how is it

482
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:39,600
pulling its it does use the HTML table

483
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:42,960
which means that yahoo respects the

484
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,190
robot stop text so if somebody has a

485
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:47,850
robots.txt that says no robots then so

486
00:21:47,850 --> 00:21:50,700
be it you can kind of get around that

487
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:51,990
but we don't really advocate it because

488
00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:56,909
it's naughty bad bad pirate yeah I'm a

489
00:21:56,909 --> 00:22:02,159
poet any other questions great hands up

490
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:04,770
people that have got beer right

491
00:22:04,770 --> 00:22:06,809
everybody else go and get a beer the

492
00:22:06,809 --> 00:22:08,970
chest is at the back and then fill out
