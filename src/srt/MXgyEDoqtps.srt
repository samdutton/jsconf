1
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:37,390

okay so this is a little hard for me but

2
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:42,820
I know what I gotta do here so hi I'm

3
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:52,720
Rick and I'm sorry there was more

4
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:55,170
difficult than I intended I'm just gonna

5
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:59,559
I'm just going to say in our day hi I'm

6
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:05,050
Rick I'm a politician I didn't expect my

7
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:07,110
life to go down this path you know I

8
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:09,729
started talking politics with friends

9
00:01:09,729 --> 00:01:11,890
over beer on Saturday nights on Friday

10
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:14,619
nights out in the pub like that was no

11
00:01:14,619 --> 00:01:18,210
big deal right and it gradually just

12
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:20,410
increased in my life before I knew it

13
00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:22,180
there was where some politics with

14
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:25,479
coffee at work I discuss some politics

15
00:01:25,479 --> 00:01:28,149
with friends as I went up in the morning

16
00:01:28,149 --> 00:01:32,600
and it gradually took over my life and

17
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:35,860
before I knew it I'd founded a political

18
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:37,630
party that's now spread to 50 countries

19
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:39,580
put multiple people in the European

20
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:41,580
Parliament and I've nominated four times

21
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:44,039
100 most influential people in the world

22
00:01:44,039 --> 00:01:51,429
it can happen to anybody in this room so

23
00:01:51,429 --> 00:02:01,470
I am a politician like I said politics

24
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:04,179
it's kind of an odd subject to talk

25
00:02:04,179 --> 00:02:05,319
about it can be a little bit

26
00:02:05,319 --> 00:02:07,690
inflammatory I try to tone it down and

27
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:09,789
talk about religion instead but Chris

28
00:02:09,789 --> 00:02:14,349
wouldn't have that but still the topic

29
00:02:14,349 --> 00:02:15,849
here is how we all can make a difference

30
00:02:15,849 --> 00:02:20,260
and you'll notice that my Twitter alias

31
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:22,450
is fun giving you just my last name I

32
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:25,830
kind of like seeing that on Twitter so

33
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:28,030
whenever you hear me to say something

34
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:34,020
worthwhile take the opportunity

35
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:39,640
to begin with a quick intro how many

36
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:44,170
here have seen Ted calm recently okay a

37
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:46,480
couple oh that's quite a few you if you

38
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,010
look at Ted I'll come right now you'll

39
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:51,160
see a similar talk as this one featured

40
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:54,250
like crazy this is one that I was

41
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:57,610
intending to give to Ted Ted Ted calm

42
00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:00,850
but they wanted just half of it so you

43
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:02,560
guys are the first to see it as it was

44
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:09,670
intended quick intro how many here have

45
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:12,459
heard of the Swedish Pirate Party before

46
00:03:12,459 --> 00:03:16,390
let's see a show hands that's pretty

47
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:20,200
pretty much I'd say that's about half to

48
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:23,769
two thirds which for some reason is so

49
00:03:23,769 --> 00:03:26,739
consistent no matter where I present no

50
00:03:26,739 --> 00:03:28,480
matter where in the world that I put it

51
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:33,190
in the slides and for kicks how many in

52
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:35,470
here have heard of any other Swedish

53
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:39,910
party let's see a show of hands yep I

54
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:48,239
see two maybe three hands so who are we

55
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:52,870
at the end of the day well why the fire

56
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:56,049
party well we love the net we love

57
00:03:56,049 --> 00:03:58,810
copying and sharing and we love civil

58
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:01,090
liberties some people decided to call us

59
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:02,560
pirates with that and rather than

60
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,390
feeling ashamed which I think was their

61
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:06,970
intent we decided to stand tall about it

62
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:09,549
and as a result of standing tall and

63
00:04:09,549 --> 00:04:12,820
proud about by what we believe in we now

64
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:14,260
have two seats in the European

65
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:16,329
Parliament 15 seats in the Berlin

66
00:04:16,329 --> 00:04:18,070
Parliament four seats in the saarland

67
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:20,350
Parliament we have about 200 seats on

68
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:23,200
local councils across Europe and we've

69
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:26,680
been copied and founded in about 56

70
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:35,279
countries at last count

71
00:04:35,289 --> 00:04:38,240
Thanks and just yesterday there was a

72
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,330
poll in Germany which gave the german

73
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:44,090
patent part i twelve percent of national

74
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:46,070
support now i know that might not sound

75
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:49,310
like much in a u.s. setting but remember

76
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:50,870
that Germany has proportional

77
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:53,509
representation this translates to twelve

78
00:04:53,509 --> 00:04:55,820
percent of the seats and if you want to

79
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:58,160
get an image of just how panicked the

80
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,130
other politicians are in Germany imagine

81
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:03,770
you'd found a party that had that held

82
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:06,500
twelve percent of the seats between the

83
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:10,940
Republicans and Democrats so both needed

84
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:12,020
the support of this party to get

85
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:14,090
anything done that's how much influence

86
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:17,990
were getting and it started out on

87
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:21,740
january first 2006 in Sweden as piero

88
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:24,289
party yet the next couple of minutes

89
00:05:24,289 --> 00:05:26,840
we're going to talk about this politics

90
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:30,500
and policies of protest as people call

91
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:34,220
it a little bit about my story on this

92
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:38,790
and what can we learn from that so

93
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:43,280
politics like people call this politics

94
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,650
of protest like you're just a protest

95
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:48,169
party come on you have no you have no

96
00:05:48,169 --> 00:05:51,289
authority here you got no right to say

97
00:05:51,289 --> 00:05:54,830
anything here as in that was something

98
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:58,729
bad right we're not talking about

99
00:05:58,729 --> 00:06:02,150
defiance here for defiance sake but

100
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:07,699
there's dissenting is always legitimate

101
00:06:07,699 --> 00:06:10,250
as an not agreeing with the current

102
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:13,250
dedmon administration not agreeing with

103
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:16,669
the status quo saying this can be done

104
00:06:16,669 --> 00:06:20,979
better is dissent by definition

105
00:06:20,979 --> 00:06:24,259
protesting is not bad it's saying we can

106
00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:26,930
do this better ourselves and we could we

107
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:33,979
can thanks oh and if you look at the

108
00:06:33,979 --> 00:06:35,780
cycles of history I mean we're not we're

109
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:38,090
not the first by far to go down this

110
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:41,690
route the Greens 40 years ago what were

111
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:44,180
protesting pollution and they went from

112
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:46,400
there saying that okay maybe it's more

113
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,110
than just pollution maybe we have some

114
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:48,370
sort

115
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:50,620
ideology here that we can put a lot of

116
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:53,919
policy from the labor movement the

117
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:55,979
workers movement eight years ago

118
00:06:55,979 --> 00:06:58,720
protested exploitation of workers by

119
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,660
factory owners and rich capital owners

120
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:04,990
and same thing there they started out as

121
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:07,870
a single issue protest and matured to an

122
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:11,199
ideology that now holds quite a few

123
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:15,190
majority seats in Europe 120 years ago

124
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:18,360
same thing they're liberals took power

125
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,650
protesting a single issue and

126
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:23,500
overbearing power from royalty and the

127
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:26,020
church and they had this weird idea

128
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:29,050
about individual rights and got into

129
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:31,539
political power about 40 about 120 years

130
00:07:31,539 --> 00:07:34,090
ago we see that there's a there's a

131
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:36,750
cycle of history here about 40 years

132
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:40,120
that every new generation recon kurz

133
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,560
democracy so we're right for a new

134
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:46,590
movement and if you're thinking about

135
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:50,560
what happened 40 years ago when the

136
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:55,840
rallying cries of the youth were peace

137
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:01,570
and love usually combined with smoking

138
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:03,910
the odd exotic plant to get the right

139
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:09,870
tone of voice

140
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:13,130
this later this concept later matured

141
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:17,510
into sustainability which has many more

142
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:19,910
syllables and so can't be pronouncing

143
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:24,380
quite the same manner but it's become a

144
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:27,790
political mantra for the past 40 years

145
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:31,940
except some things happened in a value

146
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:35,240
survey of 17 year olds which is a great

147
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:37,400
predictor for the political trends to

148
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,860
come in the following decades

149
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:42,890
sustainability is no longer at the top

150
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:46,220
of 17 year olds agendas something else

151
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:48,460
has taken that place and that is

152
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:58,760
openness and free speech and I think

153
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:02,000
that there's bears great promise and if

154
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,850
you want a simple explanation of this it

155
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:07,970
would be just leave the net alone don't

156
00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:10,660
interfere I mean you're seeing

157
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:13,330
governments all over the world

158
00:09:13,330 --> 00:09:16,940
interfering in panic with our freedoms

159
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:18,680
of speech with our ability to

160
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:20,210
communicate although they're not very

161
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:23,720
successful at it and the net at it's

162
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:26,660
very core infrastructure if you want a

163
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:28,130
great example of how they don't

164
00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:30,770
understand it about a year ago ex

165
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:33,950
president mubarak tried to shut down the

166
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:37,580
net as people as people were protesting

167
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:41,870
his rule and if I can if I can see just

168
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:45,010
one example of how they don't get it is

169
00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:49,880
that he wanted to keep people indoors

170
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,130
and as a result he thought it was a good

171
00:09:52,130 --> 00:10:01,280
idea to shut off the internet

172
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:05,110
we're seeing four things worldwide we're

173
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:07,510
seeing censorship we're seeing

174
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:10,660
wiretapping we're seeing track ability

175
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:13,510
and we're seeing identifiability being

176
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:16,540
rolled out across the net threatening

177
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:19,050
freedoms of speech threatening anonymity

178
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:21,400
threatening our very basic civil

179
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:27,460
liberties and this happens pretty much

180
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:30,160
in every country the interesting thing

181
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,470
is that only the excuses for why you do

182
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:36,030
it differ here in the West we are seeing

183
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:40,470
terrorism we're seeing file sharing and

184
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:43,780
to some extent pornography being the

185
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:47,140
excuses for shutting down freedoms of

186
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:51,310
speech in predominantly Muslim countries

187
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:53,440
it's usually sanctity of the Prophet

188
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,450
that's being used as an excuse for the

189
00:10:55,450 --> 00:10:58,750
exact same measures in China we're

190
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:01,900
seeing security of the nation so the

191
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:06,880
interesting thing here is that it's not

192
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,680
about the net at all it's about control

193
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:11,500
it's about freedoms very basic freedoms

194
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,660
of speech how many in here have heard of

195
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:17,070
this bill it was passed last last week

196
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:21,160
okay so a couple of hands up what this

197
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:24,360
bill says is that it extends harassment

198
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:26,560
criminalizing harassment to the net and

199
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:31,240
it widens it completely to making a

200
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:33,850
criminal to even pause post annoying

201
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:38,590
messages online so I mean do you realize

202
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:42,190
how ridiculous this is when I go to my

203
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:45,940
favorite fantasy forums and sit and

204
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:49,270
write a post there how I saw the Lord of

205
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:51,640
the Rings trilogy welcome while flying

206
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:55,380
over here and I gripe about how

207
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:58,630
hollywood's greed has made this

208
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:04,720
masterpiece of a trilogy into a book

209
00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:08,480
and and at that point I after having

210
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,579
written that I just rolled back and i

211
00:12:10,579 --> 00:12:12,800
bring out the big bowl of popcorn and

212
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:19,430
enjoy the show now that's all of a

213
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:22,339
sudden illegal here in Arizona it's

214
00:12:22,339 --> 00:12:28,459
criminal what we're demanding isn't

215
00:12:28,459 --> 00:12:31,160
really rocket science we're demanding

216
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:33,320
the same rights that our parents had

217
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,920
offline to apply for our children online

218
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,990
if you're looking at a letter in the

219
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:42,459
mail for years ago you and you alone

220
00:12:42,459 --> 00:12:44,570
determined whether you identified

221
00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:46,250
yourself a sander on the inside of the

222
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:48,769
envelope readable only for the recipient

223
00:12:48,769 --> 00:12:52,010
on the outside readable for the Postal

224
00:12:52,010 --> 00:12:53,209
Service and everybody who have the

225
00:12:53,209 --> 00:12:57,019
letter or frankly not at all nobody have

226
00:12:57,019 --> 00:12:58,519
the right to open this letter in transit

227
00:12:58,519 --> 00:13:02,420
just in case you'd copy a drawing nobody

228
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:04,310
had the right to stand at every mailbox

229
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:07,519
and make lists of who's sending what to

230
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:11,959
whom and I think it's perfectly

231
00:13:11,959 --> 00:13:15,529
reasonable that our children have the

232
00:13:15,529 --> 00:13:18,410
same rights as our parents had in the

233
00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:21,500
environment they live in now there are

234
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,940
some people that will object to this

235
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:25,220
notably the copyright industry who says

236
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:28,069
that if anybody can send anything to

237
00:13:28,069 --> 00:13:30,019
anybody we can we can't make money

238
00:13:30,019 --> 00:13:36,720
anymore and I say so what a

239
00:13:36,730 --> 00:13:40,069
entrepreneurs job is to make money given

240
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:42,800
the current constraints of society and

241
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:55,139
technology they do not get to dismantle

242
00:13:55,149 --> 00:13:57,860
Thank You Noah entrepreneur gets to

243
00:13:57,860 --> 00:14:00,740
dismantle civil liberties even if and

244
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:02,209
perhaps especially if they can make

245
00:14:02,209 --> 00:14:04,600
money otherwise that's a completely

246
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:07,279
illogical argument civil liberties

247
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:09,529
always take precedence and if they can't

248
00:14:09,529 --> 00:14:11,120
make money with sustained civil

249
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,889
liberties tough job go sailing

250
00:14:12,889 --> 00:14:17,209
mayonnaise entirely regardless whether

251
00:14:17,209 --> 00:14:20,839
somebody can no longer profit do you

252
00:14:20,839 --> 00:14:25,329
recall forever young song by alphaville

253
00:14:25,329 --> 00:14:27,290
let's see you show handsome men to

254
00:14:27,290 --> 00:14:29,899
remember that okay most people here how

255
00:14:29,899 --> 00:14:31,490
many have actually listened to the

256
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:38,300
lyrics not many because you remember

257
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:42,920
this very soft ballad which we dint

258
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:44,060
where we're dancing cheek to cheek

259
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:46,790
before going home with somebody and in

260
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:49,070
the eighties right this is what it's

261
00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:52,579
about the the lyrics go let's dance in

262
00:14:52,579 --> 00:14:55,639
style let's dance for a while heaven can

263
00:14:55,639 --> 00:14:58,180
wait we're only watching the skies

264
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:01,459
hoping for the best but expecting the

265
00:15:01,459 --> 00:15:03,709
worst are you gonna drop the bomb

266
00:15:03,709 --> 00:15:09,320
bowknot forever young do you really want

267
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:13,399
to live forever kind of puts a new

268
00:15:13,399 --> 00:15:18,589
perspective doesn't it I survived the

269
00:15:18,589 --> 00:15:22,250
80s I was a kid growing up in the 80s

270
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:24,800
and it's kind of tough to explain to

271
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,240
people growing up in the 90s but the

272
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:31,390
nuclear scare was so everywhere that we

273
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:35,720
went to bed and knew that one morning we

274
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:40,930
would not wake up that was reality and

275
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:44,060
as yes as tomorrow's turn into

276
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:47,149
yesterday's and years turned into

277
00:15:47,149 --> 00:15:50,630
yesteryears we realized that we had a

278
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:52,639
gift we got a gift that we'd never

279
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:56,740
expected we had never dared hope for it

280
00:15:56,740 --> 00:16:02,370
middle-aged

281
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:06,740
so and ironically that this tune was

282
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:08,210
published in nineteen eighty-four of all

283
00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:13,010
yours so my point here is that don't try

284
00:16:13,010 --> 00:16:15,740
to tell me don't try to justify these

285
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:18,590
tracking laws these snooping laws these

286
00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:21,050
these wiretapping laws by the world

287
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:23,120
having becoming having become a more

288
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:26,740
dangerous place I survived the 80s I

289
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:30,950
know it's not more dangerous anybody

290
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:33,440
claiming that is using a very common

291
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:37,550
political method now you know every

292
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:39,830
every profession has its own lingo right

293
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:43,490
like if you're an avid chess player

294
00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:45,590
you'd know that there were sequences

295
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:49,280
like the mutual queen pawn opening or

296
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:51,800
the famous Bobby Fischer sacrifice or

297
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:56,260
the Tony Hawk gliding Bishop grind but

298
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:58,790
this particular this particular

299
00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:02,000
political method of claiming that the

300
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,740
world has become more dangerous and so

301
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:06,230
we need more more see more wiretapping

302
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:09,589
is not is known within Parliament's as

303
00:17:09,589 --> 00:17:20,120
lying like a filthy weasel

304
00:17:20,130 --> 00:17:24,520
and Enzo freedom of speech we're seeing

305
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,710
politicians everywhere being totally

306
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:28,420
confused by the youth rallying for

307
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:30,850
freedom of speech as and we have that we

308
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:33,280
introduced that 120 years ago why are

309
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,170
you rallying they generally do not

310
00:17:35,170 --> 00:17:37,630
understand they do not understand that

311
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:39,490
the laws they are making is the

312
00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:40,930
equivalent of putting microphones under

313
00:17:40,930 --> 00:17:43,210
every cafe table if they understood that

314
00:17:43,210 --> 00:17:45,970
they would be horrified but they don't

315
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:48,570
spend time online they don't live online

316
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:52,600
they don't make friends online so they

317
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:53,890
don't understand what it is they're

318
00:17:53,890 --> 00:17:57,370
doing so it's up to us to educate them

319
00:17:57,370 --> 00:18:02,470
and the net here is the greatest

320
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:05,920
equalizer mankind has ever invented and

321
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:08,260
that is what people are feeling that is

322
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:10,990
with a net generation is feeling for the

323
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:12,940
first time in mankind's history a nine

324
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:15,160
year old school gun in Paraguay who just

325
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:17,080
got our first laptop under the one

326
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:21,040
laptop per child program has exactly as

327
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:26,110
strong a voice as me a middle-aged white

328
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:27,760
male in the privileged parts of the

329
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,640
world and I think that's fantastic and

330
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,380
if there's one thing I love about the

331
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:39,830
net

332
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:42,100
but there are some people who don't like

333
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:43,660
this and that is the previous one

334
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:45,400
percent that were able to interpret

335
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,950
truth for all of us who were able to

336
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:50,350
dictate what was true from what will

337
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:54,520
relies and that were able to say that

338
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:58,090
only their eyes and ears were valid they

339
00:18:58,090 --> 00:18:59,290
have lost a privilege and they're

340
00:18:59,290 --> 00:19:01,900
fighting to get it back and to the

341
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:07,240
generation growing up this attitude from

342
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:10,960
the old guard is more than offensive

343
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,700
which is why you're seeing rallies

344
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:15,940
across here Europe against acton I think

345
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:17,440
this is pretty impressive maps to be

346
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:20,610
honest these were the anti actor rallies

347
00:19:20,610 --> 00:19:24,610
so with that said with my motivation in

348
00:19:24,610 --> 00:19:27,810
place how do i do all this crazy stuff

349
00:19:27,810 --> 00:19:31,150
from an ugly webpage and seriously it

350
00:19:31,150 --> 00:19:33,880
was real ugly to putting people in

351
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:39,970
Parliament's in 2005 three things

352
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:44,050
happened there was a software patent

353
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:46,180
debate in the European Parliament which

354
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:48,220
as activists fortunately one there were

355
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:50,110
no software patents in Europe after

356
00:19:50,110 --> 00:19:51,820
which the European Patent Office went

357
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:53,410
ahead and issued them anyway but that's

358
00:19:53,410 --> 00:19:55,030
a separate issue there was yet another

359
00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:56,830
harsh inning of the copyright monopoly

360
00:19:56,830 --> 00:20:00,280
in Sweden which the politicians didn't

361
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:01,930
care about but it was just everybody

362
00:20:01,930 --> 00:20:04,180
everywhere else and there was the data

363
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:06,310
retention directive which turns all our

364
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:08,050
mobile phones into governmental tracking

365
00:20:08,050 --> 00:20:11,620
devices this last thing was just the

366
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:13,810
drop for me so I decided to register the

367
00:20:13,810 --> 00:20:15,610
domain peter party at SC and see what

368
00:20:15,610 --> 00:20:19,480
you can do of it so i put up this web

369
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:24,220
page realizing that politicians here

370
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:28,660
weren't evil they are doing their best

371
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:33,190
in their using their knowledge to give

372
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:34,780
us a better world the problem is that

373
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:36,910
whenever it's something they don't know

374
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:39,700
they asked around and lobbyists are

375
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:42,700
experts at just happening to be there

376
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:44,620
when they ask around most politicians

377
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:48,220
are not evil they're doing their best

378
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:50,260
but they're caught in a system and you

379
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:52,999
have to find a personal motivator

380
00:20:52,999 --> 00:20:57,529
to break that barrier and to motivate

381
00:20:57,529 --> 00:20:59,599
them to research the issue further I

382
00:20:59,599 --> 00:21:03,109
found that the threat of getting them

383
00:21:03,109 --> 00:21:07,519
fired was an excellent motivator it

384
00:21:07,519 --> 00:21:10,249
really made it personal to them so i

385
00:21:10,249 --> 00:21:13,129
posted a manifesto i wrote two lines in

386
00:21:13,129 --> 00:21:15,529
a chat channel Hey look the pirate party

387
00:21:15,529 --> 00:21:17,329
has its website up now after new years

388
00:21:17,329 --> 00:21:18,949
and the address that was all the

389
00:21:18,949 --> 00:21:20,869
advertising i ever did and it just

390
00:21:20,869 --> 00:21:24,319
detonated on me three days from there my

391
00:21:24,319 --> 00:21:26,659
photo was on the front page on a

392
00:21:26,659 --> 00:21:29,949
newspaper in Pakistan it was a photo ID

393
00:21:29,949 --> 00:21:32,869
I'd taken myself with the camera like

394
00:21:32,869 --> 00:21:34,729
this and you can see the toilet door in

395
00:21:34,729 --> 00:21:38,209
the back room it was awful so just

396
00:21:38,209 --> 00:21:40,369
detonated I had three hundred activists

397
00:21:40,369 --> 00:21:42,159
on the first day in IRC challenge just

398
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:44,509
holding out their hands to me like this

399
00:21:44,509 --> 00:21:45,979
thing I want to be a part of this just

400
00:21:45,979 --> 00:21:49,279
give me something that was fantastic so

401
00:21:49,279 --> 00:21:52,189
I realized this was my chance this was

402
00:21:52,189 --> 00:21:53,659
my chance to change the world for the

403
00:21:53,659 --> 00:21:57,859
better and now I had a high I had a

404
00:21:57,859 --> 00:22:01,399
good-paying IT job at the time but I

405
00:22:01,399 --> 00:22:04,429
realized I had a choice I could just

406
00:22:04,429 --> 00:22:09,079
fade back into the mainstream but if I

407
00:22:09,079 --> 00:22:11,119
done that I wouldn't have been able to

408
00:22:11,119 --> 00:22:12,829
see myself in the mirror for the rest of

409
00:22:12,829 --> 00:22:16,489
my life it wasn't a choice in practice

410
00:22:16,489 --> 00:22:18,499
it might have been in theory but the

411
00:22:18,499 --> 00:22:20,119
rest of my life would not just have been

412
00:22:20,119 --> 00:22:23,629
one big what if it would have been

413
00:22:23,629 --> 00:22:27,829
giving up on my dream so I took a huge

414
00:22:27,829 --> 00:22:30,019
loan to live off of to the next election

415
00:22:30,019 --> 00:22:32,689
and quit my job in that order very

416
00:22:32,689 --> 00:22:37,210
important

417
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:39,840
now to say I decided to go for it I

418
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,370
decided to build a pirate party in

419
00:22:41,370 --> 00:22:45,419
Sweden full-time the election is 2006 I

420
00:22:45,419 --> 00:22:46,950
mean this was the first this was in New

421
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:49,019
Year's our elections are in September so

422
00:22:49,019 --> 00:22:52,100
I had a full eight buns right we are

423
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:54,450
entrepreneurs we wear coders we know

424
00:22:54,450 --> 00:22:56,279
that you can solve a you can solve a

425
00:22:56,279 --> 00:22:59,820
problem in a weekend turns out politics

426
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:03,570
works a little differently most not

427
00:23:03,570 --> 00:23:05,009
differently but just very very very

428
00:23:05,009 --> 00:23:08,580
slower it works on a glacial scale so in

429
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:10,409
the first election we got point six

430
00:23:10,409 --> 00:23:13,080
three percent now I wasn't very happy

431
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:16,139
about that at the time but I realized

432
00:23:16,139 --> 00:23:17,970
something where they treated us as a

433
00:23:17,970 --> 00:23:19,619
joker party before the election they

434
00:23:19,619 --> 00:23:21,509
realized that there were actually some

435
00:23:21,509 --> 00:23:24,269
support for us so media treated me

436
00:23:24,269 --> 00:23:25,980
completely differently after this

437
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:27,779
election which I think had allows the

438
00:23:27,779 --> 00:23:31,499
result but we were on to something then

439
00:23:31,499 --> 00:23:33,990
I ran out of money this loan didn't last

440
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:38,340
for forever obviously so I asked the

441
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:40,679
swarm for money said ok guys if you want

442
00:23:40,679 --> 00:23:42,119
it if you want me to do this full time

443
00:23:42,119 --> 00:23:44,129
and have a little bit of money out after

444
00:23:44,129 --> 00:23:47,850
the week after the bills are paid please

445
00:23:47,850 --> 00:23:50,610
send me some spare change so I live it

446
00:23:50,610 --> 00:23:52,919
off a begging for 18 months and of

447
00:23:52,919 --> 00:23:54,629
course the tabloid scandalized me for it

448
00:23:54,629 --> 00:23:58,559
as in oh he's living off of begging yes

449
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:10,430
I was that's what passion does do you

450
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:13,330
Thanks and then came to European

451
00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:15,970
elections where we just took the world

452
00:24:15,970 --> 00:24:19,090
but completely by surprise as we became

453
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:23,710
the largest party for people under 30 we

454
00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:26,460
took twenty-five percent of the vote

455
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:29,500
securing two seats out of Sweden's 20 in

456
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:31,420
the European Parliament now two seats in

457
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:33,940
the European Parliament out of 750

458
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:36,670
something might not seem like much but

459
00:24:36,670 --> 00:24:38,860
what it did was that it kicked some

460
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:41,050
politicians out of office over not

461
00:24:41,050 --> 00:24:43,420
understanding these issues and that had

462
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:46,000
world wide repercussions because that

463
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,030
had never happened before so people

464
00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:50,530
understood that there was something here

465
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:53,410
that they didn't understand and this was

466
00:24:53,410 --> 00:24:55,840
followed by successes all over Europe in

467
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,550
particular now the German parabatai is

468
00:24:57,550 --> 00:24:59,100
doing very well at the same time as

469
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:01,300
we're still in the European Parliament I

470
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:04,180
I'm now employed by the European

471
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:05,530
Parliament and by the way the tablets

472
00:25:05,530 --> 00:25:10,110
tried to scandalize me over that too and

473
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:12,430
we're being claimed to be the fastest

474
00:25:12,430 --> 00:25:14,410
growing political movement by major

475
00:25:14,410 --> 00:25:18,690
newspapers so what do we learn from this

476
00:25:18,690 --> 00:25:21,670
what can we learn from having observed

477
00:25:21,670 --> 00:25:27,040
this there is a futurama quote which is

478
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:32,980
very relevant if and it says that when

479
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:35,560
push comes to shove you gotta do what

480
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:40,610
you love even if it's not a good idea

481
00:25:40,610 --> 00:25:48,100
I mean

482
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:51,440
I mean what kind of idiot things they

483
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,970
could change the world by founding a

484
00:25:52,970 --> 00:25:58,520
political party really this kind of live

485
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:02,240
idiot apparently and there's another

486
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:05,140
good quote here if it's stupid but works

487
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:09,410
it ain't stupid this was visit stupid

488
00:26:09,410 --> 00:26:12,260
but it works we're starting to change

489
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:15,170
the world in Germany which is as good as

490
00:26:15,170 --> 00:26:17,270
a superpower in the European Union as

491
00:26:17,270 --> 00:26:20,809
any country can be we're making policy

492
00:26:20,809 --> 00:26:22,790
so we're shifting policy in the European

493
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:25,280
Union if we're shifting positive in the

494
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:27,169
European Union we're on a tipping point

495
00:26:27,169 --> 00:26:29,510
that's going to change the world that's

496
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:42,529
reality we can that's what you can do

497
00:26:42,539 --> 00:26:45,190
so one key lesson here is that people

498
00:26:45,190 --> 00:26:47,799
aren't evil your worst enemies are not

499
00:26:47,799 --> 00:26:53,559
evil they're doing their best in their

500
00:26:53,559 --> 00:26:55,830
context to make a better world and

501
00:26:55,830 --> 00:26:59,139
painting them as evil does not help your

502
00:26:59,139 --> 00:27:03,250
cause it does not define them but it

503
00:27:03,250 --> 00:27:05,980
does something else that sees that's

504
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:10,230
important to remember it defines you and

505
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:14,350
that's that's a key lesson here d viola

506
00:27:14,350 --> 00:27:16,659
fying your adversary and understanding

507
00:27:16,659 --> 00:27:20,230
them as human beings makes your success

508
00:27:20,230 --> 00:27:28,169
much much more likely so whether or not

509
00:27:28,169 --> 00:27:31,840
you think you can change the world

510
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:34,720
whether or not you believe you're able

511
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:37,630
or unable to change the world my key

512
00:27:37,630 --> 00:27:40,059
message here is that you're probably

513
00:27:40,059 --> 00:27:46,330
right this is all about attitude this is

514
00:27:46,330 --> 00:27:48,130
all about what you think you can do and

515
00:27:48,130 --> 00:27:51,700
what you decide to do it's about

516
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:55,299
leadership you have a cause I'm betting

517
00:27:55,299 --> 00:27:57,490
that each and everyone in this room have

518
00:27:57,490 --> 00:28:00,970
some change they'd like to make and what

519
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:02,889
you need to do is to go out there and

520
00:28:02,889 --> 00:28:04,809
say I want to change the world who's

521
00:28:04,809 --> 00:28:14,590
with me there you go are you need to be

522
00:28:14,590 --> 00:28:16,450
creating to be credible you need to be

523
00:28:16,450 --> 00:28:18,029
inclusive you need to be tangible

524
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:20,679
credible as in just for sending a plan

525
00:28:20,679 --> 00:28:23,590
for making things happen that people can

526
00:28:23,590 --> 00:28:26,950
absorb that people can believe in you

527
00:28:26,950 --> 00:28:28,659
need to be inclusive as in letting

528
00:28:28,659 --> 00:28:32,260
anybody who wants to contribute to your

529
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:35,470
vision do so because more people will

530
00:28:35,470 --> 00:28:38,080
want to contribute to your making the

531
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,940
world a better place then you can

532
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:43,389
possibly imagine and you need to be

533
00:28:43,389 --> 00:28:46,179
tangible as a knot will make the world a

534
00:28:46,179 --> 00:28:49,280
better place and peace man

535
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:54,720
but hey let's go to Mars I mean don't

536
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,040
shoot for the moon that's been done

537
00:28:56,040 --> 00:29:00,990
already let's send illiteracy let's

538
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:04,050
teach two billion people to read each

539
00:29:04,050 --> 00:29:07,860
and every person in this room has the

540
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:13,620
ability to make that happen just need to

541
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:18,420
sit out on it you need to believe that

542
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:20,250
this can happen you need to set out a

543
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:23,550
plan and tell the world I believe that

544
00:29:23,550 --> 00:29:28,400
we together can make this difference

545
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:31,890
where many we're strong and we've

546
00:29:31,890 --> 00:29:35,670
decided to make this happen and you can

547
00:29:35,670 --> 00:29:38,580
do that just remember that for each and

548
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:40,800

566
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:53,890
