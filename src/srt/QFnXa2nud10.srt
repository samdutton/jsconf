00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:32,710
really love CSS

[Music]

9
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:09,009
CSS account for you is all about

10
00:02:09,009 --> 00:02:11,140
community it's about people now like I

11
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:13,120
walked into the legislation and then

12
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,980
like you know immediately I have to

13
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:16,480
person like it's an event about

14
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,680
computers but really it's about the

15
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,250
humans behind me and no detail is

16
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:24,280
overlooked and it's great as an attendee

17
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,050
that there's you there's nothing to

18
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:27,730
worry about like having the prayer room

19
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:29,800
having the quiet room that the pocket

20
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:35,319
space community lounge it's a space and

21
00:02:35,319 --> 00:02:37,959
its own little stage really to put a

22
00:02:37,959 --> 00:02:39,970
spotlight on people who are doing

23
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:42,040
positive things in the community this

24
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,569
year at the community lounge we have the

25
00:02:43,569 --> 00:02:45,610
theme of gratitude and we said you know

26
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:48,160
how has the tech community positively

27
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,650
impacted you I wanted people to come

28
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:53,650
away thinking what power do I have to do

29
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:56,170
good and it's it's huge

30
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:59,080
we can do little things we can do tiny

31
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,700
things that maybe we don't even think

32
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:02,620
about that have such a huge impact on

33
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:03,730
people

34
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:06,200
sometimes I find a paper an old

35
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,850
algorithm that is actually made by a

36
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:08,450
woman

37
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:10,460
but many people sometimes even including

38
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:12,110
me I thought that was actually a man

39
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:14,420
behind that name we were coming up with

40
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:17,090
the idea of making an advent calendar of

41
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:21,360
24 women there are pioneers in in tech

42
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:27,509
[Music]

43
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:30,049
and I think about CSS I think it's

44
00:03:30,049 --> 00:03:32,420
creative coding and I try to always to

45
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:35,030
match the design of just creativity and

46
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:38,450
playfulness that's why it shows Flavor

47
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:44,690
Flav and colors and shapes I'm talking

48
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:47,629
about how to apply the Houdini specs to

49
00:03:47,629 --> 00:03:49,269
your work today in design systems

50
00:03:49,269 --> 00:03:52,700

51
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:54,170

52
00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:55,459
and its importance

53
00:03:55,459 --> 00:03:59,840
we were the unseen my talk was about

54
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,299
visual testing it was a description of

55
00:04:02,299 --> 00:04:04,910
how our tools have changed the way that

56
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:06,849
we do a modern web development over time

57
00:04:06,849 --> 00:04:10,489
my 20 year dev journey and how things

58
00:04:10,489 --> 00:04:12,290
were different back then to how they are

59
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:13,060
now

60
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:14,300

63
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:40,100
I love community events cuz they bring

64
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:41,690
together people from all over the globe

65
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:44,539
they enable everyone to feel welcome and

66
00:04:44,539 --> 00:04:45,949
make them feel that they're a part of

67
00:04:45,949 --> 00:04:48,110
the community and community events are

68
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:50,030
also so special for up-and-coming

69
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:52,669
developers if you are new in the

70
00:04:52,669 --> 00:04:54,320
community getting a lot of exposure to

71
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,090
new things just finding new people that
