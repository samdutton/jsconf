1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,790

I think we should think more outside of

2
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:12,330
the box

3
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:14,580
my name is Phillip in racing on Twitter

4
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:16,199
you found me a spikey on github you

5
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:19,949
found yes poltergeist yeah we think we

6
00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:23,369
use our technologies like each day the

7
00:00:23,369 --> 00:00:25,560
same way like totally the same way we

8
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:29,340
should reconsider basically like do it

9
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:32,489
differently let's take for example

10
00:00:32,489 --> 00:00:35,250
we right get commit messages like each

11
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:38,640
day this could be a journal basically

12
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,579
how we write them right so like a blog

13
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:44,850
isn't it so wait this is actually pretty

14
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:48,360
awesome so let's say I prepared

15
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:51,870
something which I call like good luck or

16
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:54,719
good journal basically so I have

17
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:57,300
different commit messages basically the

18
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:59,010
ones which I don't want to show my blog

19
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:02,370
is basically that's - - exclude and this

20
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:04,290
is how I recognize them so you see

21
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:05,939
basically good luck has basically

22
00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:08,189
already two different styles like short

23
00:01:08,189 --> 00:01:11,189
here like one is the very big version

24
00:01:11,189 --> 00:01:14,640
the other one is very condensed so I've

25
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,460
had like a little or a couple of NPM

26
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:22,560
scripts which basically do create like a

27
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,009
different were which creates a custom

28
00:01:26,009 --> 00:01:29,310
format for get locks and I write the

29
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:33,320
this to like in index markdown file and

30
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:35,939
yeah this is basically to add a nice

31
00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:37,799
seam on github and then I deploy this to

32
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:40,590
get her pages so let's create a message

33
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:43,320
so basically let's make a bookmark so

34
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:46,470
JSON Kampf is there's an awesome

35
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:49,470
conference you know and this might be

36
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:52,140
the link for the next awesome.js

37
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:54,299
uncomf-- which might mean next year so

38
00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:58,799
let's put this like yeah right then we

39
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:01,350
credit commit or credit to commit and

40
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:05,070
then yeah we basically just run em run

41
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:07,680
build and this pushes to you well

42
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,289
basically this builds our spirit then it

43
00:02:10,289 --> 00:02:11,880
pushes it to my

44
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:21,750
posit re and let's see this my screen

45
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:29,630
okay yeah oh let's see awesome there's

46
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:32,130
already what I've created out of my

47
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:34,920
divots that were out of my commit

48
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:38,010
messages so how far how far is this for

49
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:40,050
me blogging I don't know but it

50
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:43,200
definitely helps me was my get work flow

51
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,140
since I use crazy but where I have like

52
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:48,480
a similar get alias was a different

53
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,580
format which I usually run against

54
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:52,890
origin/master when before I created PR

55
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:55,290
and then I commit a copy this and paste

56
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:57,600
this at my commitment whereas my PR

57
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:01,050
message since I'm usually very verbal

58
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:02,850
and microwaved messages about how to how

59
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:05,640
you can test it and what I changed

60
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:09,690
actually so I push this onto my PRS and

61
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:12,420
nobody a because sometimes people don't

62
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:14,130
look at your commit messages like in

63
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:16,170
detail so this helps me in my daily

64
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:18,780
workflow and I just made it up then

65
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:21,390
where I just found this out by doing

66
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:22,110
something crazy

67
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:25,410
so sometimes we should come out of our

68
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:28,530
silos and look at stuff which we don't

69
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:30,420
usually do or even look at our stuff

70
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:32,370
with with a different set of eyes by

71
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:36,250
thinking outside of the box thank you

72
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:36,810
[Applause]
