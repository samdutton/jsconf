1
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:21,510

you

2
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:25,240


3
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:27,550
so I

4
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:30,039
about JavaScript crypto and I'm a

5
00:00:30,039 --> 00:00:32,920
freelancer as you've just heard I've

6
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:35,260
done a lot of security projects in the

7
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:40,449
past and I actually love Ruby and now

8
00:00:40,449 --> 00:00:42,790
you might ask yourself what am i doing

9
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:45,820
that Jas conf well I love crypto but I

10
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:50,470
love JavaScript to and I wrote a lot of

11
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:54,100
Java crypto code in the past and I wrote

12
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:56,170
a lot of Ruby and see cryptic code in

13
00:00:56,170 --> 00:00:58,629
the past but it never wrote any

14
00:00:58,629 --> 00:01:01,570
JavaScript crypto code now why is that

15
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:05,009
is it because I don't like the language

16
00:01:05,009 --> 00:01:09,250
well not really because the reasons for

17
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:11,380
that have been summarized pretty nicely

18
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:15,009
in this blog article I think you

19
00:01:15,009 --> 00:01:17,470
probably read that it's written by

20
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:23,380
Montesano and note that they're just

21
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:25,810
talking about client-side crypto so it's

22
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:28,659
totally fine to use something like no

23
00:01:28,659 --> 00:01:31,360
Jess doing crypto there but the problem

24
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:34,929
is on the client let's have a look at

25
00:01:34,929 --> 00:01:37,780
why it's basically doomed in the general

26
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:41,080
case the JavaScript code is served over

27
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:44,259
HTTP so it's pretty easy for somebody to

28
00:01:44,259 --> 00:01:46,810
intercept the code while its interests

29
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:50,200
mission and this man in the middle could

30
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,840
do everything that they want they could

31
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,640
serve different files they could change

32
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,429
the files they could inject code into

33
00:01:57,429 --> 00:02:02,679
HTML yeah whatever they want now okay

34
00:02:02,679 --> 00:02:04,450
let's take care of that let's take care

35
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:06,970
of the transmission let's secure the

36
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:09,450
transport channel we have h GPS for that

37
00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:12,190
this actually will work to prevent

38
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:14,319
man-in-the-middle attacks because they

39
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:17,680
can no longer snoop into communication

40
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,370
there but the problem is what if

41
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:23,410
somebody on the service side decides to

42
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:25,989
go rogue they could actually serve you

43
00:02:25,989 --> 00:02:29,680
bad files from the beginning and this

44
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,400
even doesn't matter if it's a GPS or not

45
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:36,220
because they will just send the files on

46
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:38,920
the server so the transport channel

47
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,010
doesn't matter

48
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:43,250
and the conclusion by Matt Asano is that

49
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:45,829
if you don't trust the app to do the

50
00:02:45,829 --> 00:02:47,569
cryptography which is what we basically

51
00:02:47,569 --> 00:02:50,299
do right now so if you don't trust the

52
00:02:50,299 --> 00:02:52,700
app how could you trust any JavaScript

53
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:55,340
code that the absence to you so there's

54
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:57,650
no difference in there and they're right

55
00:02:57,650 --> 00:03:01,760
about it and yeah please note that this

56
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,860
is not a javascript problem per se it's

57
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:05,870
just because javascript is being used on

58
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:07,640
the client and if it were any other

59
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,019
language they would have the same

60
00:03:09,019 --> 00:03:12,790
problems but to be honest there are some

61
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:16,250
JavaScript problems as well so most

62
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:18,760
algorithms actually require you to do

63
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:22,099
operations on bytes or 32-bit integers

64
00:03:22,099 --> 00:03:24,440
and this is pretty complicated in

65
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:26,000
JavaScript because we have no

66
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,120
out-of-the-box support for that and

67
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:31,310
there's also no support for big integers

68
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:34,159
which is something that is yeah really

69
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:35,900
important for public key cryptography

70
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:40,159
and there are workarounds there exists

71
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:43,159
libraries to do this but they don't have

72
00:03:43,159 --> 00:03:45,199
native support for this so they're

73
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:48,379
usually pretty slow and there's also

74
00:03:48,379 --> 00:03:51,319
problem problems with javascript in the

75
00:03:51,319 --> 00:03:55,250
browser itself the biggest problem is

76
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:57,230
probably that we don't have a secure

77
00:03:57,230 --> 00:04:00,129
random number generator what we have is

78
00:04:00,129 --> 00:04:02,780
math with random but this is pretty

79
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:05,840
predictable and this doesn't help in the

80
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,870
case of crypto because we really need

81
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:11,720
for everything in cryptography we need

82
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:14,480
secure random numbers and if you don't

83
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,130
have that we didn't just don't have to

84
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:18,650
start with anything because it's trivial

85
00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:22,520
IAM breakable so there are again

86
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:25,430
workarounds that try to induce real

87
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:28,460
randomness by detecting mouse movements

88
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:31,430
and stuff but i don't know this is

89
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:32,960
clearly something that we should have in

90
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:37,099
the browser by default built-in so there

91
00:04:37,099 --> 00:04:39,470
has been recently crypto get random

92
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:41,659
values which is an attempt to provide a

93
00:04:41,659 --> 00:04:45,440
real random number generator that is

94
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:48,229
secure but as so often the problem is

95
00:04:48,229 --> 00:04:51,639
it's not supported by everybody

96
00:04:51,639 --> 00:04:54,409
so another problem with the language

97
00:04:54,409 --> 00:04:57,529
itself is that what makes it so fun

98
00:04:57,529 --> 00:05:01,069
which is the same problem that also

99
00:05:01,069 --> 00:05:04,309
makes writing crypto heart and that's we

100
00:05:04,309 --> 00:05:07,519
can change everything and run time as we

101
00:05:07,519 --> 00:05:10,729
want to so nobody prevents you from

102
00:05:10,729 --> 00:05:12,529
doing something like this so if you

103
00:05:12,529 --> 00:05:14,719
think you can provide a better random

104
00:05:14,719 --> 00:05:16,129
number generator you can simply

105
00:05:16,129 --> 00:05:18,559
overwrite the built-in functionality and

106
00:05:18,559 --> 00:05:22,189
this works with firefox 23 actually so

107
00:05:22,189 --> 00:05:24,169
there's nothing that makes this

108
00:05:24,169 --> 00:05:27,129
immutable you can just override it and

109
00:05:27,129 --> 00:05:29,089
this doesn't even have to be intentional

110
00:05:29,089 --> 00:05:31,819
and so let's say you're under pressure

111
00:05:31,819 --> 00:05:34,429
and you look at some code that you don't

112
00:05:34,429 --> 00:05:35,779
really understand and you try to

113
00:05:35,779 --> 00:05:37,999
optimize it and something like this

114
00:05:37,999 --> 00:05:41,169
could happen so you just override the

115
00:05:41,169 --> 00:05:45,610
encryption and you don't know better and

116
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:48,469
another problem is using something like

117
00:05:48,469 --> 00:05:50,959
Jason pier so we often rely on remote

118
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:53,599
code so we can't really trust that code

119
00:05:53,599 --> 00:05:56,149
because they could just go on and

120
00:05:56,149 --> 00:05:57,829
override something that is critical for

121
00:05:57,829 --> 00:06:01,999
our security so if we just define random

122
00:06:01,999 --> 00:06:04,729
values on the server the remote server

123
00:06:04,729 --> 00:06:07,189
could actually override this and do bad

124
00:06:07,189 --> 00:06:10,639
stuff with that so the problem is our

125
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:13,639
environment could change at any instant

126
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:15,529
and we don't have a good measure to

127
00:06:15,529 --> 00:06:20,059
actually verify its integrity now I've

128
00:06:20,059 --> 00:06:22,459
shown you a lot of things that suck but

129
00:06:22,459 --> 00:06:24,499
it's just the end of it and I don't

130
00:06:24,499 --> 00:06:26,479
think so because we've seen recent

131
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:28,279
developments that are actually pretty

132
00:06:28,279 --> 00:06:31,369
interesting and we've seen attempt at

133
00:06:31,369 --> 00:06:33,409
providing something that gives us built

134
00:06:33,409 --> 00:06:37,159
in crypto in the browser one of those

135
00:06:37,159 --> 00:06:39,499
developments is a MJS so it's not just

136
00:06:39,499 --> 00:06:41,749
good for playing unreal tournament it's

137
00:06:41,749 --> 00:06:46,039
also good for doing exactly what we need

138
00:06:46,039 --> 00:06:48,999
in crypto exact with integer operations

139
00:06:48,999 --> 00:06:51,559
it gives us typed array support which

140
00:06:51,559 --> 00:06:55,789
makes it really fast and another major

141
00:06:55,789 --> 00:06:57,739
improvement that we've seen lately is

142
00:06:57,739 --> 00:07:01,099
the development of the w3c web crypto

143
00:07:01,099 --> 00:07:02,160
API

144
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,890
this gives us begin teacher support for

145
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:10,110
RSA another public-key algorithms and it

146
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:12,750
also gives us this um CSP orangie the

147
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:15,720
secure random number generator and other

148
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:20,940
laughs many other good stuff so let's

149
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,590
say this works in the future but if

150
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:24,210
still haven't told you why you should

151
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:26,790
care why is this important to be able to

152
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:30,570
do crypto in the browser and I think

153
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:33,900
with recent developments one big subject

154
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:36,030
that we all need to care about is

155
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:39,870
privacy so you've probably heard this

156
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:41,400
sentence that privacy is not so

157
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,200
important if you have nothing to hide

158
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:46,050
then you don't need privacy and I think

159
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:54,690
this is total because it's just

160
00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:56,940
a sorry ass excuse to explain everything

161
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:59,610
and I think even in the audience every

162
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:01,470
single one of you has something that

163
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:04,170
they wouldn't want us to know publicly

164
00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:07,260
and the problem is we as social beings

165
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:09,570
we're often in a social context that is

166
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:13,170
closed and so we work problems out and

167
00:08:13,170 --> 00:08:16,110
so we tend to forgive but the internet

168
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:18,480
stores it forever so it does neither

169
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:22,500
forget nor does it forgive and its

170
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,570
really really dangerous because today's

171
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:26,760
surveillance is different than it was in

172
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,350
the past so in the past you needed

173
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:31,350
humans to spine you you so you felt you

174
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:33,539
probably felt if your privacy was

175
00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:35,729
intruded but today it's more like

176
00:08:35,729 --> 00:08:38,310
nuclear radiation you can't feel it if

177
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:43,289
your privacy is violated and this is not

178
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:45,420
a matter of where you live or where

179
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:47,790
you're born it's not a state it's not

180
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:50,640
good states bad states it's I think the

181
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,400
interest in our data is global and we

182
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:56,460
all have to care about this even if you

183
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:59,190
think that our government is benevolent

184
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:01,800
it's not the government it's the people

185
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:05,460
that do the harm so not the system is

186
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:07,590
evil or the system is to blame it's the

187
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:10,470
people that are to blame and they will

188
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:12,600
abuse their power it has happened in the

189
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,339
past and it will happen again if you

190
00:09:14,339 --> 00:09:15,810
give somebody too much

191
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:17,880
or they start on snooping on their

192
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:20,550
girlfriend or boyfriend and it just sums

193
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:25,290
up so even if there's decisions that are

194
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:27,210
meant to be good the some of them

195
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:29,520
because they're unrelated may lead to

196
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,500
something that slips out of our control

197
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:36,089
and this is what has just happened so we

198
00:09:36,089 --> 00:09:37,980
create something that we cannot control

199
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:41,250
any longer and one of the problems is

200
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:44,010
that a company if you provide an

201
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:46,800
application to the public then you can

202
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,660
implement perfect crypto on the front

203
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:51,839
but agencies will just go in the back

204
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:54,060
and they will get your data because you

205
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:57,360
store it in plain text somewhere and so

206
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,790
this this happens through extortion or

207
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:02,430
the data is sold whatever and it's a

208
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:05,870
problem now the question is are we

209
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:08,610
powerless against this can we do

210
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:11,550
something to protect ourselves and I say

211
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:13,350
we can we have to start encrypting our

212
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:16,560
stuff on the client and to do that we're

213
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:20,150
going to need clients are crypto and

214
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:23,130
this improves things because even if an

215
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:25,400
institution has leverage over a

216
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,660
corporation if they can extort them to

217
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:30,390
end over the data it doesn't matter if

218
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:32,880
we as individuals encrypted it and it's

219
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,750
not profitable to try to decrypt

220
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:40,830
everything from every single human now

221
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:43,290
if this doesn't convince you and you're

222
00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:46,860
still yeah you still think that it's

223
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:48,630
okay for them to have your data because

224
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:52,980
there's nothing suspicious let me try

225
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:56,160
this surveillance will have an impact on

226
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:59,400
your life totally and we will slowly

227
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,440
graduate from something which we believe

228
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,750
to be a good thing innocent until proven

229
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:06,780
guilty to something more of guilty until

230
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:08,280
somebody can prove that you're innocent

231
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:12,420
and it also puts determinism in our

232
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:14,580
lives which we certainly don't want and

233
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:17,459
there has been a case in Germany where a

234
00:11:17,459 --> 00:11:19,230
teacher wasn't allowed to become a

235
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:21,930
teacher because she had to give her DNA

236
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:25,709
sample and they detected that she might

237
00:11:25,709 --> 00:11:28,890
be affected by a fatal disease in the

238
00:11:28,890 --> 00:11:29,459
future

239
00:11:29,459 --> 00:11:31,470
and so she wasn't allowed to take the

240
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:33,869
job and I think this is pretty bad

241
00:11:33,869 --> 00:11:35,639
because you're held accountable for

242
00:11:35,639 --> 00:11:38,209
something that hasn't even happened and

243
00:11:38,209 --> 00:11:40,740
which probably is never going to happen

244
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:44,490
and because there are way too many

245
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:48,389
people they won't be able to put human

246
00:11:48,389 --> 00:11:50,220
beings on the profiling it will have

247
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:52,589
algorithms for that and how would you

248
00:11:52,589 --> 00:11:55,019
feel about if you're being denied a job

249
00:11:55,019 --> 00:11:58,350
or if you're even put in jail just

250
00:11:58,350 --> 00:11:59,790
because you have the same hair color

251
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:05,490
than a mass murderer and it conveys the

252
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:07,499
false sense of knowing everything about

253
00:12:07,499 --> 00:12:10,379
you even if I know all the data from you

254
00:12:10,379 --> 00:12:12,929
that is online I still believe that we

255
00:12:12,929 --> 00:12:16,259
are more than this and we have our free

256
00:12:16,259 --> 00:12:18,300
will we have our thoughts and it's not

257
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:20,279
just the actions that you see online so

258
00:12:20,279 --> 00:12:22,350
they don't know about you but they

259
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:26,069
claim to know things about you and if

260
00:12:26,069 --> 00:12:28,259
you're still not convinced this is

261
00:12:28,259 --> 00:12:29,790
something that people often do they put

262
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:32,939
their vacation pictures on facebook so

263
00:12:32,939 --> 00:12:37,150
let me show you how this could go awry

264
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:39,660
imagine that you put your bikini picture

265
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:41,790
up there and you actually forgot to

266
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:44,040
shave and the bikini area and somebody

267
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:46,319
notices this publishes the picture

268
00:12:46,319 --> 00:12:48,779
online and this goes viral becomes a

269
00:12:48,779 --> 00:12:52,199
meme would you like that no and we

270
00:12:52,199 --> 00:12:54,240
always have to remember that the faces

271
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,040
and memes are actually real people and

272
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:59,670
probably they don't like to be suddenly

273
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:03,509
famous and if we look at surveillance

274
00:13:03,509 --> 00:13:05,999
throughout history I mean we as Germans

275
00:13:05,999 --> 00:13:09,149
should know this it's always been

276
00:13:09,149 --> 00:13:10,559
claimed that this is for the greater

277
00:13:10,559 --> 00:13:14,759
good it's to protect us but it never was

278
00:13:14,759 --> 00:13:17,759
and to tell you secret not a single

279
00:13:17,759 --> 00:13:20,279
person felt safer there it was the

280
00:13:20,279 --> 00:13:22,679
opposite they were constant in constant

281
00:13:22,679 --> 00:13:25,920
fear because they were severely

282
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,439
restricted in their attempts to

283
00:13:28,439 --> 00:13:31,139
experiment because they felt observed

284
00:13:31,139 --> 00:13:34,889
all the time now if you try to use

285
00:13:34,889 --> 00:13:37,649
crypto the answer is usually that it's

286
00:13:37,649 --> 00:13:40,410
bad that you shouldn't do it while at

287
00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:42,870
the same time agencies claim that they

288
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:43,290
need to

289
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:48,209
do this in order to protect you and the

290
00:13:48,209 --> 00:13:51,000
yeah this is always the excuse and this

291
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,829
just happened i think last week when an

292
00:13:52,829 --> 00:13:55,050
NSA official declared that they have to

293
00:13:55,050 --> 00:13:57,540
snoop on people because this is the only

294
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:59,610
way how they can actually arrest child

295
00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:01,500
molesters human traffickers to our

296
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:04,949
clothes and so on but this is really an

297
00:14:04,949 --> 00:14:06,540
excuse do you think this is there a

298
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:10,470
major concern too yeah arrest human

299
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:12,480
traffickers I don't think so it may be a

300
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,550
byproduct but it's certainly not the

301
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:17,220
major operation so this is just an

302
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:21,029
excuse and there's this imbalance we are

303
00:14:21,029 --> 00:14:22,769
supposed to be completely transparent

304
00:14:22,769 --> 00:14:26,069
while at the same time agencies are

305
00:14:26,069 --> 00:14:28,290
allowed to have secrets and I think this

306
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:32,069
just doesn't work out I'm yeah I would

307
00:14:32,069 --> 00:14:34,440
say they should have their secrets

308
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,870
because this protects the operation of

309
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:39,029
agencies but at the same time we should

310
00:14:39,029 --> 00:14:42,149
be allowed to have our secrets too and I

311
00:14:42,149 --> 00:14:44,430
want us to move back to something more

312
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:47,160
of mutual trust so by default the

313
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:48,930
government should trust its citizens

314
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:51,410
citizens and not the other way around

315
00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:56,839
and this is really scary some German

316
00:14:56,839 --> 00:14:59,579
politician actually claimed in public

317
00:14:59,579 --> 00:15:01,560
that he believes that security is more

318
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:03,600
important than our personal freedom and

319
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,920
again I think this is because

320
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:09,660
your personal freedom is some form of

321
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:11,490
security and I think if they take this

322
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:13,680
away then there can be no security at

323
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:18,750
all now let me give you a quick

324
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:20,190
excursion of something that would

325
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:22,800
totally solve this for good and it's

326
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,160
called homomorphic encryption a

327
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:28,620
homomorphism is a mathematical function

328
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:31,260
that maps from one structure G to

329
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:33,959
another structure H it implies two

330
00:15:33,959 --> 00:15:37,769
operations in GH and the clue of it is

331
00:15:37,769 --> 00:15:39,899
that applying the function to the

332
00:15:39,899 --> 00:15:43,110
combination of those two elements will

333
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:44,880
yield the same result as applying the

334
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,199
function to the elements individually

335
00:15:46,199 --> 00:15:49,620
and then combining it pretty complicated

336
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:52,820
so let me give you an example

337
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:55,860
so for simplicity let's say our a

338
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:59,220
homomorphism is 1 over X and G H are the

339
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:01,110
same thing the real numbers as you know

340
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:05,040
them and the two operations are actually

341
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:08,250
also the same they're the multiplication

342
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:10,890
in real numbers so if you just simply

343
00:16:10,890 --> 00:16:13,290
write out the definition then f apply to

344
00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:17,520
a times b is 1 over a times B which by

345
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:19,800
the loss of multiplication is 1 over 8

346
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:22,380
times 1 over B and this is actually the

347
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:25,050
right hand side of the definition so 1

348
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:29,160
over X is a homomorphism we can find

349
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:31,950
this in crypto to RSA some example for

350
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:34,830
this as a quick recap RSA encryption is

351
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:37,200
defined as having a public key e a

352
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,690
modulus m and then the encryption is

353
00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:42,840
just taking X to the e and then taking

354
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:47,820
it modulo M if we look at this using

355
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:49,890
multiplication again then this will

356
00:16:49,890 --> 00:16:51,750
again be home morphisms so the

357
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:56,550
encryption of X 1 times X 2 as x 1 x x 2

358
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:59,220
to the e by the loss of exponentiation

359
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:02,430
we can pull in the exponent there and by

360
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:05,030
loss of modular arithmetic we can apply

361
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:07,760
modulo operation individually and then

362
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,110
again we have the right hand side of the

363
00:17:10,110 --> 00:17:12,870
definition but if we try the same thing

364
00:17:12,870 --> 00:17:15,630
for addition it won't work out because

365
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:18,060
there's no law that would allow us to do

366
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:22,980
the last line there so this holds true

367
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:24,959
in general it's pretty easy to find a

368
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:27,209
homomorphism for one of the operations

369
00:17:27,209 --> 00:17:29,760
so in mathematical fields usually have

370
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:33,990
two operations for example addition and

371
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:37,530
multiplication and you find something

372
00:17:37,530 --> 00:17:39,090
for one of the operations but it's

373
00:17:39,090 --> 00:17:41,040
pretty hard to find something for both

374
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,960
and this would be called fully

375
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:46,680
homomorphic encryption and the

376
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:48,750
definition there is just extended by

377
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:50,670
another operation so you look at two

378
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:53,840
operations at the same time and this

379
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:57,680
equation has to hold for both operations

380
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:00,750
now you might ask yourselves why is this

381
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:03,750
so important well it preserves the ring

382
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,059
structure of the

383
00:18:05,059 --> 00:18:08,899
original structures to put this in

384
00:18:08,899 --> 00:18:11,120
simpler terms think about it as it

385
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:14,299
allows you to do algorithms unencrypted

386
00:18:14,299 --> 00:18:17,779
data yielding encrypted results and if

387
00:18:17,779 --> 00:18:21,710
you decrypt it again it makes sense so a

388
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:24,110
good example would be Google search so

389
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:26,210
if we had something like fully

390
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:28,370
homomorphic encryption then we could

391
00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:31,429
actually put in our search terms ghoul

392
00:18:31,429 --> 00:18:33,649
would get this encrypted would perform

393
00:18:33,649 --> 00:18:35,720
the algorithm would produce a result

394
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:38,720
which is still encrypted and only you

395
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,429
can decrypt the result and it makes

396
00:18:40,429 --> 00:18:42,289
sense and Google won't learn anything

397
00:18:42,289 --> 00:18:45,980
about your search of course this can be

398
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:49,539
abused but i think the advantages are

399
00:18:49,539 --> 00:18:52,129
outweigh the disadvantages and this

400
00:18:52,129 --> 00:18:54,860
would really give us privacy the looks

401
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:57,710
and the question has been for a long

402
00:18:57,710 --> 00:18:59,720
time so many people have claimed that

403
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,580
this is not possible at all but then

404
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:03,950
last year this guy made a major

405
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:05,950
breakthrough and actually found a

406
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:08,860
function that just allows us to do this

407
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:13,700
but it's still rocket science and it

408
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:17,450
won't be available in decades until we

409
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:20,269
can use this and every day programming

410
00:19:20,269 --> 00:19:23,110
so question is what can we do right now

411
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:27,289
and this is an example I've worked a lot

412
00:19:27,289 --> 00:19:28,999
in the past with the European Commission

413
00:19:28,999 --> 00:19:31,820
and European Commission tries to

414
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:34,639
introduce those Eid cards in every

415
00:19:34,639 --> 00:19:39,379
European country and the idea is to do

416
00:19:39,379 --> 00:19:41,749
tax forms and stuff like that online

417
00:19:41,749 --> 00:19:44,899
without requiring requiring you to go to

418
00:19:44,899 --> 00:19:48,139
an office and this is all great but

419
00:19:48,139 --> 00:19:50,210
somebody forgot to think about how we

420
00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:53,360
would use this and a problem in a

421
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,999
browser context is the only way that

422
00:19:55,999 --> 00:19:58,490
allows you to access smart cards is by

423
00:19:58,490 --> 00:20:01,249
using Java applets and this worked for

424
00:20:01,249 --> 00:20:03,200
some time but after last year I don't

425
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,210
think with all the security problems

426
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:09,230
nobody wants to use applets anymore now

427
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:12,889
firefox had this experimental access to

428
00:20:12,889 --> 00:20:15,460
smart cards which is pretty cool but

429
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:17,869
nobody picked it up and this is

430
00:20:17,869 --> 00:20:18,780
something

431
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:21,030
please browser people think of us

432
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:23,880
Europeans so that we can use smart cards

433
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:26,280
eid cards from the prowl this would be

434
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:29,580
really cool and the advantage is that we

435
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:31,320
actually have a secure device that

436
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:34,440
stores the keys and applications could

437
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:36,540
no longer access the keys on that device

438
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:41,640
so it's a real improvement and I also

439
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:44,280
believe that we are the only people that

440
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:46,170
can actually assess the dangers and

441
00:20:46,170 --> 00:20:49,620
risks of all these privacy intrusions so

442
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:51,390
we must fix the problems the general

443
00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:53,880
public doesn't care because they can't

444
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:57,630
really understand the problems for

445
00:20:57,630 --> 00:20:59,970
example many you have advised us to use

446
00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:03,120
PGP as mine for emails student use

447
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,940
client-side encryption tools but I ask

448
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:07,800
you how often did your relatives your

449
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,930
mom your girlfriend your boyfriend use

450
00:21:09,930 --> 00:21:13,410
this actually and so I'm saying this

451
00:21:13,410 --> 00:21:15,930
opt-in is not going to work nobody is

452
00:21:15,930 --> 00:21:18,540
going through the ordeal to install all

453
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:21,090
that on their computer what I want

454
00:21:21,090 --> 00:21:24,030
is for my mom to go online it should all

455
00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:26,970
be secure implicitly so she doesn't need

456
00:21:26,970 --> 00:21:31,440
to do anything to be secure and also

457
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,840
academia must help us fix this problem

458
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:37,710
for example we had sharing schemes they

459
00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:40,470
are already present and they would allow

460
00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:42,690
us to render extortion useless so that

461
00:21:42,690 --> 00:21:46,080
it no longer works to just extort one

462
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,350
specific person but they would have to

463
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:51,090
extort many people at the same time and

464
00:21:51,090 --> 00:21:53,730
this is much harder to do and so this

465
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:57,000
would render this whole business useless

466
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,330
and I want something like one time

467
00:22:00,330 --> 00:22:01,710
encryption so if you think of the

468
00:22:01,710 --> 00:22:04,470
messages and mission impossible you read

469
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:06,800
it and then it is also into thin air and

470
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:10,280
the same thing is being researched in

471
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:14,730
cryptography because it's really hard to

472
00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:17,130
do with mathematical tools but there has

473
00:22:17,130 --> 00:22:19,830
been some nice research and I think this

474
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:23,160
would be perfect for secure and chats or

475
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:25,110
something like that so it you receive

476
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:27,240
the message and after you read it it

477
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:29,220
becomes useless nobody can decrypt it

478
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:30,870
anymore

479
00:22:30,870 --> 00:22:33,540
and I want to encourage you to use the

480
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:37,920
web crypto API I think it's a major step

481
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:40,680
forward even if as we saw at the

482
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:42,210
beginning there's no real difference

483
00:22:42,210 --> 00:22:44,670
between applications side crypto and

484
00:22:44,670 --> 00:22:47,190
clients are correct or right now I still

485
00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:50,970
think it's a matter of trust so even if

486
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:53,250
you do the crypto on your local machine

487
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:56,550
using local tools only you still have to

488
00:22:56,550 --> 00:23:00,990
apply trust at some point because who

489
00:23:00,990 --> 00:23:02,760
tells you that your browser or your

490
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:05,160
operating system is actually secure have

491
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,750
you looked through all of the source

492
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:11,040
code have you compiled it yourself and I

493
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:12,720
think this is a chicken and egg problem

494
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:15,990
because of course you can do HCBS

495
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:18,720
downloads you can put a signature on the

496
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,400
package you can verify that signature

497
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,220
but in order to verify the signature you

498
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:25,080
again need some piece of software so you

499
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:26,790
would have to do the whole verification

500
00:23:26,790 --> 00:23:29,429
process over again and this yeah it's

501
00:23:29,429 --> 00:23:32,700
just not solvable and that's why I

502
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:35,070
believe that clients are crypto using

503
00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:38,100
something like them w3c API is still is

504
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:40,650
an improvement because mostly it doesn't

505
00:23:40,650 --> 00:23:42,960
allow the app to use the keys anymore

506
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:45,300
they can't look into the keys they don't

507
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:48,540
see our passwords and so it's really an

508
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:51,840
improvement but a problem with this API

509
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:54,420
is it takes all of this code just to

510
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:58,440
encrypt a little piece of data and this

511
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:01,290
just calls for ya implementation errors

512
00:24:01,290 --> 00:24:04,380
and unfortunately it's a low-level API

513
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:07,290
like openssl which gives you full

514
00:24:07,290 --> 00:24:09,840
control which is a good thing but it

515
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:12,929
also gives you full possibility to shoot

516
00:24:12,929 --> 00:24:16,620
yourself in the foot and worst of all

517
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:19,770
there's no security false so you have to

518
00:24:19,770 --> 00:24:21,540
figure out yourself what works and what

519
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:24,750
doesn't and I'd rather want something

520
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:26,880
like this which is easy to use high

521
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,340
level you generate a key then you

522
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:31,910
encrypt your data and you're done

523
00:24:31,910 --> 00:24:34,559
because I believe that sure we can all

524
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:36,600
acknowledge cryptos heart and it

525
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,970
certainly is but I don't think that the

526
00:24:38,970 --> 00:24:41,400
API is surrounding it have to be hard

527
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,560
and complicated

528
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:45,480
that's why I work on a project which is

529
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:48,540
a ruby project still which is called

530
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:50,730
crypt and the idea is to provide a

531
00:24:50,730 --> 00:24:52,920
framework that wraps all those low-level

532
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:56,250
API s and exposes a higher level API

533
00:24:56,250 --> 00:24:59,070
that makes crypto understandable easy to

534
00:24:59,070 --> 00:25:01,470
use and it's secure by default so you

535
00:25:01,470 --> 00:25:02,820
don't have to figure out all the

536
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:06,780
parameters and I think we need the same

537
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:10,560
thing in JavaScript we're gonna get the

538
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:13,620
w3c API it's too complicated we need

539
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:16,320
something that is more simple to use and

540
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:19,260
so I think something like a grip chase

541
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:23,880
would be a good idea so that's it thank

542
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:34,590
you
