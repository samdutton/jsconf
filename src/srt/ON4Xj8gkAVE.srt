1
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:09,690

do you remember the time when you fell

2
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:13,620
in love well see ya do you remember the

3
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:16,529
first feature you were so excited about

4
00:00:16,529 --> 00:00:18,359
well like Marquette which was very

5
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:21,060
popular some time ago and if you don't

6
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:22,949
remember it on websites probably you're

7
00:00:22,949 --> 00:00:26,250
very young and do you remember the web

8
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:28,890
design trends despite you back in the

9
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:29,460
days

10
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:34,110
yeah so it's it's very tough to get back

11
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:36,600
to those feelings and those days and if

12
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,790
you're a long-term marriage with

13
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:41,850
front-end development is in crisis and

14
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:46,020
if your love for CSS has burned out it's

15
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:48,600
time to do something about it and we're

16
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:51,930
the awesomes I'm Agra India as a short

17
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:54,600
intro I'm a designer and coder and doing

18
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,059
a front-end developer and we will find

19
00:00:57,059 --> 00:00:58,260
that the awesomes which is an

20
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:00,570
organization which teaches people how to

21
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:03,510
create awesome things on the web and

22
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:07,350
also we do it all not-for-profit and as

23
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:09,150
a side project after work

24
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:10,740
yeah just like Kevin said we were based

25
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:13,500
in in Poland and Warsaw and if you have

26
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,750
any comments or questions we'd be more

27
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:18,060
than happy to read all of them for

28
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:19,920
instance in our Twitter you can see our

29
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,430
Twitter handle so we have to make a

30
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:26,430
small disclaimer right now you might be

31
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:30,540
disappointed but there will be no code

32
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:32,820
and no life coding sessions

33
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:36,000
unfortunately yeah we won't get into any

34
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,490
technical details we won't show you any

35
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:41,909
brand-new CSS framework or coding

36
00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:46,590
techniques and no fleshie CSS effects

37
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:48,630
but rather than that we will tell you

38
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:50,729
true stories about people that we have

39
00:01:50,729 --> 00:01:54,869
met during the last two years so there

40
00:01:54,869 --> 00:01:56,340
is the time in your career when you

41
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:59,040
realize that coding is cool but you need

42
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,020
two more interact with people a

43
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:03,689
different ground than your daily job so

44
00:02:03,689 --> 00:02:05,579
this is what happened for us some time

45
00:02:05,579 --> 00:02:07,350
ago and we were lucky because it's

46
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:08,670
happened at the same

47
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:10,679
so we can see right now is our chat on

48
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:13,290
Twitter and we are trying to set arrange

49
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:15,540
a meeting and do something together for

50
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:17,160
the community so this was the idea let's

51
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:21,120
do something and as you said it all

52
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,720
started two years ago in December 2015

53
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,690
yes and the idea was rather humble we

54
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:29,970
didn't have any fixed plan and

55
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:33,989
everything went very spontaneously so we

56
00:02:33,989 --> 00:02:35,700
were really overwhelmed with what

57
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:38,010
happened that this one meeting tour

58
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:39,720
meeting actually initiated something

59
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:44,730
very big and it engaged more than 3,000

60
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:49,890
applicants and 64 awesome participants

61
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:53,190
who were learning the basic of HTML and

62
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:55,890
CSS and among them were people from

63
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:58,019
various professions like philosophers

64
00:02:58,019 --> 00:03:00,810
architects designers photographers etc

65
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:04,650
etc yes it's good to mention that seven

66
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:07,170
people and out of them actually became

67
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:10,049
junior front-end developers and it's

68
00:03:10,049 --> 00:03:12,420
worth adding that we weren't aiming at

69
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:14,700
like encouraging people to change their

70
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:16,380
profession what we wanted to do is to

71
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:18,269
show that coding can be cool no matter

72
00:03:18,269 --> 00:03:20,069
what you do daily it can be a very

73
00:03:20,069 --> 00:03:20,790
useful tool

74
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:24,239
so we extremely proud of them and also

75
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:28,109
it included 80 hours of coding 11

76
00:03:28,109 --> 00:03:30,840
mentors who held this and numerous hours

77
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,410
of preparations preparing materials

78
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:36,120
searching for the venue and planning all

79
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,549
the smallest details and you might be

80
00:03:38,549 --> 00:03:39,810
wondering right now why are we talking

81
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:41,849
about it while you showing these numbers

82
00:03:41,849 --> 00:03:44,250
because you're on a CSS conference you

83
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:46,859
would like to see some code but probably

84
00:03:46,859 --> 00:03:48,810
we bad that probably some of you have

85
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:51,419
ever thought that it would be good to do

86
00:03:51,419 --> 00:03:53,280
something for the community do a slight

87
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,109
project do something what you love that

88
00:03:55,109 --> 00:03:56,760
you can't do at work because you're

89
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:59,250
doing other things so we hope that

90
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:00,900
you'll feel inspired and if you already

91
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:04,079
run your community or around type of

92
00:04:04,079 --> 00:04:06,870
site project or team activity we'll have

93
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:08,669
some useful tips and tricks and

94
00:04:08,669 --> 00:04:11,280
practicalities which you can apply to

95
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,970
make your community even bigger so it

96
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:17,010
all started and at the very beginning we

97
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:17,450
did

98
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:19,400
and he fixed plaid we just felt that

99
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:22,190
there is the lack of such initiatives

100
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:25,280
connected with HTML and CSS in our

101
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,180
neighborhoods

102
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:29,540
so we decided to do something about it

103
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:31,190
and it starts yes and we were observing

104
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:33,340
different initiatives connected with

105
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:36,800
front-end development coding Ruby on

106
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,790
Rails and we saw that they organized

107
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:42,860
very long workshops during weekends and

108
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:44,870
we decided to do something different we

109
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:48,830
decided to divide our whole course into

110
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:52,010
smaller and regular meetings so we were

111
00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:54,260
meeting in the afternoon after I will

112
00:04:54,260 --> 00:05:00,290
regular job and we care about good

113
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:03,350
design so we prepared our own layouts

114
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:05,960
for our participants and the three

115
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:11,540
examples are we used on a workshops and

116
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:14,450
our participants were voting which one

117
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:18,260
they prefer to call by themselves so

118
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:21,470
yeah it helps to engage people if you

119
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:25,150
give them that's it the decision to make

120
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:28,310
as you probably know that to Harless

121
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:30,050
things in the web development is cache

122
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:32,420
invalidation and naming things so we

123
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:35,060
also have our problem to come up with

124
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:37,520
some some catchy name for our

125
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,100
initiatives and as you can see most of

126
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:43,100
them are rather cheesy yeah my firm is

127
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:46,040
one is fantastic but yeah in the end we

128
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:49,160
decided to pick worth awesome because

129
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:51,920
it's awesome and it's connected with

130
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:55,960
World Wide Web because it has w3 W's and

131
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:58,400
because we want we wanted to feel like a

132
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,910
big awesome family we finally picked the

133
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:05,840
awesomes and our tagline is awesome

134
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:08,690
people just like us who do awesome

135
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:12,770
things on the web and also there are

136
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:14,780
lots of communities that encourages

137
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:18,140
women and join the detect community and

138
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:20,150
we decided that

139
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:22,940
rather be open for everyone for people

140
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:25,060
from different walks of life different

141
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:31,720
experiences different professions yes

142
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:35,150
and we really wanted to bring new people

143
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:38,180
into our industry so we really wanted to

144
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:41,810
encourage beginners and what is a one of

145
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:43,820
our goal was to break the nerd

146
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,770
stereotype we really wanted to show that

147
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:47,660
we were like cheerful people and of

148
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:49,220
course we love spending time in front

149
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:51,620
come in front of computer screen but

150
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:56,479
this is not the only hobby we have it

151
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:58,820
all started and we set up our own

152
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:01,160
webpage and also wanted to look

153
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:04,220
professional so it's required to have on

154
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:06,979
Facebook fan page and we created an

155
00:07:06,979 --> 00:07:09,650
event and was waiting if anyone would be

156
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:13,160
interested in learning coding and HTML

157
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:17,000
and CSS basics but rather we been

158
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,820
overwhelmed about how many applications

159
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:22,360
we received and we imagine there were

160
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:27,620
more than 1000 and 800 of them yes it

161
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:29,510
was a really big number and we had to

162
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:33,820
read all of them and we had to select 20

163
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:36,349
final participants it was extremely

164
00:07:36,349 --> 00:07:37,729
tough because people were very

165
00:07:37,729 --> 00:07:40,729
hard-working ambitious talented but that

166
00:07:40,729 --> 00:07:44,330
decision was made and it consisted of

167
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:46,969
eight classes divided

168
00:07:46,969 --> 00:07:51,439
two hours yeah this is our program yeah

169
00:07:51,439 --> 00:07:54,039
we try to divide our program into like

170
00:07:54,039 --> 00:07:57,729
edible chunks not to make our

171
00:07:57,729 --> 00:08:00,049
participants feel overwhelmed by the

172
00:08:00,049 --> 00:08:02,360
program so we started with the very

173
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,909
beginnings as you can see and started to

174
00:08:04,909 --> 00:08:06,979
getting more advanced things and people

175
00:08:06,979 --> 00:08:10,189
really love building layouts and first

176
00:08:10,189 --> 00:08:12,049
we taught them how to use floats and

177
00:08:12,049 --> 00:08:14,929
later showed how the grid works to show

178
00:08:14,929 --> 00:08:18,709
that the total different approach and we

179
00:08:18,709 --> 00:08:21,499
also engage friends from our industry as

180
00:08:21,499 --> 00:08:24,049
mentors and they were really grateful

181
00:08:24,049 --> 00:08:26,539
for them and they really helped us with

182
00:08:26,539 --> 00:08:28,879
mentoring and tracking progress of our

183
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:32,659
participants and even if you're an

184
00:08:32,659 --> 00:08:36,439
expert in the industry you can see that

185
00:08:36,439 --> 00:08:38,689
teaching others is a really tough nut to

186
00:08:38,689 --> 00:08:42,469
crack and we have some lesson learned

187
00:08:42,469 --> 00:08:46,009
for example we unintentionally started

188
00:08:46,009 --> 00:08:48,290
to use technical jargon and for example

189
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:51,019
for people from outsider tech bubbles

190
00:08:51,019 --> 00:08:54,290
slack is just a mysterious words yes and

191
00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:56,329
many people were asking so how they

192
00:08:56,329 --> 00:08:58,759
should actually approach learning HTML

193
00:08:58,759 --> 00:09:00,800
CSS shouldn't be approached just like

194
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,589
foreign languages or maybe should they

195
00:09:03,589 --> 00:09:05,779
learn all HTML tags by heart

196
00:09:05,779 --> 00:09:07,850
so at the time we realize it's so easy

197
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:09,769
to forget about your own beginnings when

198
00:09:09,769 --> 00:09:11,540
you were struggling with your first line

199
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:14,689
of code so we're more aware what types

200
00:09:14,689 --> 00:09:16,879
of words we should use what our teaching

201
00:09:16,879 --> 00:09:19,250
methods we should introduce to our

202
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:22,040
course to make the pruning process much

203
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:25,459
more easier in these it doesn't matter

204
00:09:25,459 --> 00:09:27,769
how much time do you spend polishing

205
00:09:27,769 --> 00:09:30,110
your slides and giving the lecture the

206
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:32,029
most important part of the teaching

207
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:34,759
process is the hands-on experience and

208
00:09:34,759 --> 00:09:38,589
what you can see is the layout coded

209
00:09:38,589 --> 00:09:42,529
totally from scratch by by one of our

210
00:09:42,529 --> 00:09:45,630
participants from the first edition Anya

211
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:47,670
and we believe that this experience cell

212
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:50,220
learning from practical examples is more

213
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:52,800
important than some example taken

214
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,420
completely out of context

215
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:59,640
and sorry w3schools yes we also paid a

216
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,380
little attention that people could

217
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:06,720
practice at home so we prepared a

218
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,240
tutorial which is available for free for

219
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,880
everyone unfortunately it's in Polish so

220
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:14,690
if you'd like to contribute right now

221
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:17,730
feel free to to come to us we'd be more

222
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:20,580
than happy to have something someone who

223
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:23,060
can help us to translate it to English

224
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:26,310
there are some spooky creatures in CSS

225
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:28,800
and everyone is afraid of and for our

226
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,410
participants surprise surprise it

227
00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:34,590
appeared to be positioning specificity

228
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:37,620
yes and specificity sometimes it's even

229
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:40,110
hard for us for seasoned developers so

230
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:42,570
there wasn't surprised that that

231
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:44,430
participants have some problems at the

232
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:46,050
very beginning to grasp the general

233
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:50,340
concept how it works and we believe that

234
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:53,100
asking questions is a crucial part of

235
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:55,200
the learning process so there are no

236
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,720
stupid questions and we wanted to our

237
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:00,180
participants to feel as comfortable as

238
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:02,880
it's possible and when we were seeing

239
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,350
that there are some of them is

240
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:06,840
struggling along with some hard code

241
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:09,300
problem we try to approach them we are

242
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:12,450
our mentors to help them and we also

243
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:15,480
tried to create a friendly family like

244
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:18,210
atmosphere so we divided them into

245
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:21,420
smaller sub groups yes and of course we

246
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:24,060
have a problem with naming them again we

247
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:26,190
needed five groups so the first idea was

248
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:28,170
oh maybe we could use the the Brett

249
00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:30,900
web-browser names but who would like to

250
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:32,820
join the internet explorer group well

251
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:35,730
probably not so many people so we did it

252
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:38,760
we decided to change the concept and we

253
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:41,610
pick the pantent score names for for the

254
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:45,240
year it was 2016 and it gave the

255
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:47,190
artistic vibe to our workshops and

256
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:48,900
people were really that identifying

257
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:51,060
themselves with the colors so girls were

258
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:52,940
in rose quartz and they were very happy

259
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:55,110
there was David who can see in the

260
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:57,190
middle he was in

261
00:11:57,190 --> 00:11:59,530
serenity group so it was a lot of fun

262
00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:02,650
and there's some friendship started

263
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:05,200
among her participants so it was really

264
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:09,580
worth it to try to act like like big

265
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:10,900
family and there were some

266
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:12,850
collaborations between people from

267
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:15,010
different professions so it became

268
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:17,080
really interesting to see them all also

269
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:19,060
after the workshops I guess that even

270
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:21,640
some ideas for startups were initiated

271
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:24,750
so we're like a stirrup hop as well and

272
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:27,550
people love competition so this is why

273
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:30,010
we wanted to incorporate the l-man into

274
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:32,200
our work ships as well and after each of

275
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:35,020
the classes we prepare a quiz on the

276
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:36,820
Kahoot platform if you don't know it you

277
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:38,260
should check it out because it's awesome

278
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:41,950
and there were it's very beneficial

279
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:44,290
because of two reasons the first one is

280
00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:47,110
that people were revising the moderator

281
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:49,630
material so they were getting more and

282
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:51,310
more experience and the second one is

283
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:53,380
just more engaging fun and we can you

284
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:55,120
can see right now on the video if you

285
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,090
can see this if not I'm so sorry but it

286
00:12:58,090 --> 00:13:00,400
is the is our Meetup and we're so where

287
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,410
people were playing the the quiz and it

288
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:06,790
was so exciting as you can see and our

289
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:10,030
success was to bring more designers

290
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:12,040
throughout the end well our focus on

291
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:15,490
aesthetics really paid off and the code

292
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:18,850
appears to be really good so new tool

293
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:21,550
it's used for designers and help them

294
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:23,290
communicate more efficiently with

295
00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:26,350
developers yes and designers started to

296
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:28,470
like us which was very nice feeling and

297
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:30,700
thanks to that we were reviving too many

298
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:33,640
events for designers mainly so this is

299
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:35,470
the workshops we gave during element

300
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:36,610
talks this is one of the biggest

301
00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:38,380
conferences in Poland for designers

302
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:43,570
gathering more than 1500 designers we

303
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:44,980
were on different conference talking

304
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:47,140
about collaboration between developers

305
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:49,570
and designers we did another workshops

306
00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:52,900
for artists and we're mentioning this

307
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:55,480
not to boast off but to give you the

308
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:57,310
sense that sometimes it's really good to

309
00:13:57,310 --> 00:14:00,790
step out of your comfort zone and and

310
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:04,390
check other explore order filled other

311
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:06,820
areas other environments and it's

312
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:08,240
extremely inspiring

313
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,490
and it has definitely affected the way

314
00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:12,200
we work and the way we communicate with

315
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:16,910
people and was also an important part

316
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:20,180
first was to because the devil is in the

317
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:23,330
details we also create our branding and

318
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:26,029
it was really attractive to people they

319
00:14:26,029 --> 00:14:28,550
were hunting for our gadgets on our

320
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:30,020
events and our meetups

321
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:33,290
it was really cool and we managed to

322
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:38,830
produce for example yeah flashy pins and

323
00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:42,649
they fake tattoos it was really a good

324
00:14:42,649 --> 00:14:45,410
integration game when people were like

325
00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:49,130
yeah some people have had attack on

326
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:52,339
their neck collar for speakers and we

327
00:14:52,339 --> 00:14:54,200
have them with us so if you are not shy

328
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,270
please come after after a lunch break

329
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:57,080
yeah welcome

330
00:14:57,080 --> 00:15:02,120
and also the also sucks and now so watch

331
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:05,720
out because we do have one pair of them

332
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:08,600
with yes and you can film happy owners

333
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:12,649
just like you know Kravitz so Martha

334
00:15:12,649 --> 00:15:19,089
good luck you don't think to be excited

335
00:15:19,089 --> 00:15:22,730
yeah yeah sorry you can you can give it

336
00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:25,370
to your friend which is a girl out there

337
00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:29,750
or unfortunately it's female sighs so

338
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:33,200
yeah we were running out of bigger

339
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:38,450
silence yeah and now we like to focus on

340
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:41,839
an important topic which became kind of

341
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:46,010
a buzzword in our industry and actually

342
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:52,190
we believe that actions have more effect

343
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:55,579
that works and in fact we haven't

344
00:15:55,579 --> 00:15:58,190
mentioned the diversity words explicitly

345
00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:01,940
not any ones we were promoting our

346
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:05,270
events people and what's interesting

347
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:10,130
about 75% of our community are women yes

348
00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:12,020
and we of course observing what's

349
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:14,089
happening in the industry what's

350
00:16:14,089 --> 00:16:15,870
happening on Twitter they're here

351
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:19,560
but if you're just open if you respect

352
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:21,570
other people if you're kind diverse

353
00:16:21,570 --> 00:16:23,820
community should emerge itself so it

354
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:25,350
shouldn't be something that you push

355
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:27,390
yourself very hard it should be natural

356
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:29,960
in our opinion and it happened for us

357
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:34,590
I'm the coolest thing that happens when

358
00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:36,570
we were running the auctions that apart

359
00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:39,480
from jazzy workshops we create created

360
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:43,200
something bigger which is a community

361
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:46,740
and it was really awesome to see that

362
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:49,890
from an inconspicuous idea it turned out

363
00:16:49,890 --> 00:16:54,120
something really huge yes that you need

364
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,500
to be aware that if you do something

365
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:59,340
publicly that your initiative will be

366
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:01,620
exposed for a critic and so friendly

367
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:04,200
comments so you have to deal with it

368
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:06,300
because otherwise your enthusiast might

369
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:09,060
be dumping and your it might cut your

370
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:11,580
wings so some comments were like a

371
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:16,080
broken record CSS is not the programming

372
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:18,870
flag now yeah it doesn't really matter

373
00:17:18,870 --> 00:17:22,500
if this and some people were talking

374
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:26,580
about 16 hours for learning just such

375
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:29,460
easy things like HTML and CSS is

376
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:32,790
insanely long yeah but what is funny on

377
00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:34,410
the opposite there were some people who

378
00:17:34,410 --> 00:17:37,170
saw that well yeah like when you meet

379
00:17:37,170 --> 00:17:39,870
like eight times for two hours is 16

380
00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:42,090
hours it's insanely short to write a

381
00:17:42,090 --> 00:17:44,790
good-quality website so there was some

382
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:48,510
opposite opinions and also the women in

383
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:50,910
tech sync appeared and some people saw

384
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:56,430
that our initiative is created mostly

385
00:17:56,430 --> 00:17:58,320
for women because we are pink and

386
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,420
cheerful social media but in fact it

387
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:02,910
wasn't true because we were open for

388
00:18:02,910 --> 00:18:06,330
everyone yes and you can imagine that

389
00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:08,520
after all these comments after a whole

390
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,200
year when we were organizing workshops

391
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:13,110
meetups after I work as an additional

392
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:16,200
project we're extremely exhausting but

393
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,000
there is actually one thing that can

394
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,400
cheer you up and it's the greatest

395
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,950
reward for all your efforts and these

396
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:25,660
are sexist stories from our participants

397
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:28,810
yes mentioned some of them now we're

398
00:18:28,810 --> 00:18:31,480
probably probably wearing a batch of

399
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:34,180
junior web developers some of them are

400
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:36,910
successful designers communicating with

401
00:18:36,910 --> 00:18:40,060
developers some of them creating created

402
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:43,480
really awesome site projects and now you

403
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:46,050
can hear them speaking by themselves

404
00:18:46,050 --> 00:18:49,560
this is the audio time praying right now

405
00:18:49,560 --> 00:19:03,020
it doesn't work can we try again

406
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:09,330
No

407
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:14,150
yes boiler yeah we know Dennis who had

408
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:15,560
the audio problem as well

409
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:18,710
is there is there a chance or should we

410
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:24,890
skip it um once again sorry it works

411
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:31,850
before yeah it worked now you can see on

412
00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:34,790
your face yeah she called it plenty

413
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:39,590
there the website she's a designer yeah

414
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:41,840
she actually graduates from architecture

415
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,000
yeah

416
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:47,120
okay let's try so she as a designer also

417
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:51,750
now codes are designed by herself

418
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:55,900
no it's it should be okay

419
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:58,460
oops sorry

420
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:03,380
yeah pictures yeah so should we try to

421
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:05,630
paraphrase what's happening in the video

422
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:11,240
or are still having the chance to make

423
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:16,460
this work

424
00:20:16,470 --> 00:20:29,770
it worked before so maybe

425
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:39,960
okay let's try again oh why we're

426
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:43,110
editing till late night yesterday it's

427
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:52,000
worth to do it please

428
00:20:52,010 --> 00:20:54,870
okay

429
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,760
okay okay so let's give it so we can

430
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:03,640
tell it no so girls were talking what

431
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:06,190
they love in CSS and what they hate and

432
00:21:06,190 --> 00:21:09,730
for instance a DA she said that she

433
00:21:09,730 --> 00:21:11,680
loves when you can create spectacular

434
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:15,660
things not knowing a lot about CSS but

435
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:18,160
and here's the moment yeah she's talking

436
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,750
about it

437
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:23,800
spectacular websites the CSS but oh no

438
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,990
this is not the moment whatever yeah

439
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:28,090
that the spectacular thing is gonna be

440
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:29,950
at least spectacular for you because the

441
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:31,420
web sites can be very ugly sometimes

442
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:33,990
especially when you started how to code

443
00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:37,870
Alena hate naming things in CSS but

444
00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:40,270
instead she thinks that it's a very

445
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:41,800
useful tool for communicating with

446
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:45,580
developers because she is a designer we

447
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:48,340
have Magda and she said that she loves

448
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:50,680
flexbox but at the same time she hates

449
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:54,520
that it doesn't work every word and yeah

450
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:56,800
Anya said that she she she's very

451
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:59,200
worried sometimes that CSS doesn't work

452
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,060
with her and she doesn't know why

453
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:04,900
so yeah and ferger's mostly coding it's

454
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:06,970
a really great new experience something

455
00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:11,560
that opened their eyes and show a new a

456
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:15,010
new way in their profession so it was

457
00:22:15,010 --> 00:22:19,000
very valuable for them to learn how to

458
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:23,350
code so yeah as you seen the failures

459
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:26,500
cut and also failures happen among our

460
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,690
participants it happened some unrequited

461
00:22:28,690 --> 00:22:32,080
love towards CSS life is not as rosy as

462
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:34,660
it's painted not luxorious

463
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:39,340
our badges and fortune in socks yes so

464
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:41,470
some people abandoned coding and

465
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:43,330
abandoned every classes and it was a

466
00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:45,790
very hard feeling for us because it we

467
00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:48,310
took it very personal but you know you

468
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:51,040
need to somehow accept the fact and come

469
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,780
to terms with that some people are not

470
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:55,420
just so keen on coding just like we are

471
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:58,060
and maybe they didn't have time or just

472
00:22:58,060 --> 00:23:03,580
didn't enjoy coding at all yeah so we

473
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:05,809
love meeting Queens

474
00:23:05,809 --> 00:23:08,210
pants with people from our community not

475
00:23:08,210 --> 00:23:13,820
in front of computers and not have just

476
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:17,590
in their chats about technology but also

477
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:20,359
yeah we have great fun during our

478
00:23:20,359 --> 00:23:23,119
meetups it's it's so called reunions

479
00:23:23,119 --> 00:23:25,369
when we invite people from former

480
00:23:25,369 --> 00:23:26,749
editions of the workshops and our

481
00:23:26,749 --> 00:23:30,320
friends and we just enjoy talking

482
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:35,529
together and to also love animals and

483
00:23:35,529 --> 00:23:39,019
they are also invited to our workshops

484
00:23:39,019 --> 00:23:42,109
and Freddy started learning flex books

485
00:23:42,109 --> 00:23:45,349
with us but we don't know if he's

486
00:23:45,349 --> 00:23:48,080
already grasped the idea I guess he

487
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:50,389
abandoned this in the favor for yes is

488
00:23:50,389 --> 00:23:51,979
great because he saw that these are like

489
00:23:51,979 --> 00:23:56,599
contradictory ideas yeah

490
00:23:56,599 --> 00:24:01,909
yeah yes so we're here at CSS confer the

491
00:24:01,909 --> 00:24:05,269
past and CSS con invents in general are

492
00:24:05,269 --> 00:24:08,119
very open and lots of people come from

493
00:24:08,119 --> 00:24:10,399
different parts of the world so we speak

494
00:24:10,399 --> 00:24:12,739
different languages we different food

495
00:24:12,739 --> 00:24:14,989
during our lunch time we have different

496
00:24:14,989 --> 00:24:17,089
hobbies but there is one thing that we

497
00:24:17,089 --> 00:24:20,179
have in common and this is the love for

498
00:24:20,179 --> 00:24:23,839
CSS and we're like a big CSS family and

499
00:24:23,839 --> 00:24:25,820
we're very grateful that we had an

500
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:27,799
opportunity to share our story with you

501
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:31,129

at the YouTube channel with tutorials or

516
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:09,559
gave a talk and you don't need to be an

517
00:25:09,559 --> 00:25:11,380
expert just like I was here

518
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:14,620
