00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:18,110

Thanks as an insurance policy in case my

2
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:19,760
demo doesn't work today I brought it out

3
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,260
last night I was working at all today so

4
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:22,760
there are some people who actually did

5
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:24,740
see it work so let's see if the demo

6
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:26,680
gods are nice to me

7
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:31,089
so everybody loves robots right ow

8
00:00:31,099 --> 00:00:33,559
Jason Huggins co-creator of the selenium

9
00:00:33,559 --> 00:00:37,420
project and co-founder CTO sauce labs

10
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:40,790
you should follow me on Twitter all

11
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:43,160
right so this is for the next three

12
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:45,559
slides and only the next or two or three

13
00:00:45,559 --> 00:00:47,420
slides is a repeat after me thing so

14
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:50,570
everybody get your vocal cords warmed up

15
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:51,530
repeat after me

16
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:58,690
testing let's try that again testing is

17
00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:03,469
not cool let's try that again oh I won't

18
00:01:03,469 --> 00:01:10,729
I'll just let you do it you don't really

19
00:01:10,729 --> 00:01:12,140
believe it I don't I don't believe it

20
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:14,509
anyway you're wrong by the way you can

21
00:01:14,509 --> 00:01:20,560
stop repeating so here is a nice little

22
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,840
philosophy thought process here robots

23
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:28,340
are cool robots can test their for

24
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:31,250
testing with robots is cool tada

25
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:35,569
so this project really is I've been in

26
00:01:35,569 --> 00:01:37,099
this whole testing thing I'm kind of you

27
00:01:37,099 --> 00:01:39,920
start as a developer fell into software

28
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:43,160
testing by accident it's actually really

29
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:45,860
interesting intellectual problem for me

30
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:48,619
and I think if you don't care about

31
00:01:48,619 --> 00:01:50,869
testing it means you don't have an app

32
00:01:50,869 --> 00:01:52,700
with any users or that makes any money

33
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:56,209
right which sounds like an insult but

34
00:01:56,209 --> 00:01:57,229
actually if you're like a stealth

35
00:01:57,229 --> 00:02:00,349
startup it's more important to you know

36
00:02:00,349 --> 00:02:02,119
if you're two guys in a garage two girls

37
00:02:02,119 --> 00:02:02,720
in a garage

38
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,310
the more important thing is to ship

39
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:06,259
anything something that's relevant that

40
00:02:06,259 --> 00:02:07,610
people care about and so at the very

41
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:09,110
beginning yeah testing is actually not

42
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:11,150
important but once you do have users

43
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:12,620
once you do have revenue what it comes

44
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:15,470
down to is once you're at 3 a.m. and you

45
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:16,940
get a page that something is broken

46
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:18,620
you're gonna want to fix that problem

47
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:21,200
and then want to start doing testing so

48
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,310
you never have to do that again of

49
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:25,430
course it's you know it's harder than

50
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:28,840
that but testing it testing is important

51
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:31,790
anyway so today the the the thing I've

52
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:34,040
been doing all these last years is doing

53
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:36,140
all the software stuff and this project

54
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:38,870
I call it it's made of this building

55
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:40,250
material called bit beams so that kind

56
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:41,390
of the home for this project is called

57
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:42,350
bit beam gorg

58
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:44,750
and I'm really kind of taking the

59
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:47,960
software out of the computer and making

60
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,190
a test in the real life so it's kind of

61
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:50,870
like if you remember Tron the movie you

62
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:52,100
know he falls in the computer this is

63
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:54,320
kind of like the reverse Tron I'm taking

64
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:57,200
the selenium the software robot out out

65
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,480
into the real world so let me tell you

66
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,040
briefly a little bit like where this

67
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,540
story came from or where this where this

68
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:04,240
kind of crazy thing came from

69
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:08,630
so a long time ago Sony came out this

70
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:10,730
thing called the robot dog and I've

71
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:12,350
actually always been interested in

72
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:13,880
robots ever since I was a kid and then

73
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,620
the late 90s Tony came out with this

74
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:16,880
thing is like oh my gosh the robot

75
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,650
revolution is on which is also weird

76
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:20,810
robot revolution is also on now it seems

77
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:22,190
like it kind of goes in waves like every

78
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:25,280
10 years there's like a new revolution

79
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,800
anyway back then robot dogs so I had

80
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:32,959
this idea to you know long story but I

81
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:35,120
was gonna do robot fish right why not

82
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,630
right and so I started to make these 3d

83
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:40,730
simulations of house fish swam I bought

84
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:42,530
books I went to aquariums and I learned

85
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:44,239
this crazy thing that fish swim in a

86
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:46,370
sine wave if you kind of look at it

87
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:48,530
especially like an eel it's it's very

88
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:50,090
much a perfect sine wave thing so I

89
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:53,390
started doing 3d simulations and on the

90
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:55,100
software not on this thing but I had

91
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:56,930
this thing called pin arts I hope

92
00:03:56,930 --> 00:03:58,400
everyone's gonna seen this not everyone

93
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,360
knows that it's called pin art but

94
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,530
everyone knows what I'm talking about I

95
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:02,959
had this kind of this thing was sitting

96
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:04,220
on my desk and yet I was doing 3d

97
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:08,090
simulation of swimming fish and sine

98
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:09,530
waves and stuff like that on my desktop

99
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:11,420
and I thought wow it's ironic I really

100
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:13,730
want to see this 3d animation but it's

101
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:15,890
trapped on this 2d piece of glass so

102
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:19,430
this is kind of you know not talking

103
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:20,959
about software robots but this is kind

104
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:22,640
of like this art project hobby thing

105
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,380
that I've had going for a while this

106
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:26,000
motorized pen art idea is something I'm

107
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,880
still I want to have existed in the

108
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:33,020
world um so I started again just this

109
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:35,390
hobby not related to testing not a job

110
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:37,039
related thing I didn't know what to call

111
00:04:37,039 --> 00:04:38,660
my motorized pen art thing so I called

112
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:41,539
it pin thing and I've got a demo here

113
00:04:41,539 --> 00:04:42,169
the

114
00:04:42,169 --> 00:04:43,580
think about this I guess in the room I

115
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:46,520
don't I haven't met mr. doob yet is he

116
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,590
here or is he around anyway but this is

117
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:51,529
3j s on on the software and then I'm

118
00:04:51,529 --> 00:04:55,129
using the RAM Remy's console and so the

119
00:04:55,129 --> 00:04:59,150
idea for this little art project is to

120
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:01,729
you know if I want an array of pins I

121
00:05:01,729 --> 00:05:03,139
can do all kinds of animations but to

122
00:05:03,139 --> 00:05:06,139
kind of start simple I think maybe if I

123
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:07,699
get four of these I could do a clock and

124
00:05:07,699 --> 00:05:09,110
you know the whole point of the really

125
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:12,069
this project is like I want to get into

126
00:05:12,069 --> 00:05:14,150
robotics and mechanics and all kinds of

127
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:16,219
fun stuff again still not related to

128
00:05:16,219 --> 00:05:19,219
testing not related to anything j-job

129
00:05:19,219 --> 00:05:20,659
related but this pin thing I want to

130
00:05:20,659 --> 00:05:25,129
exist and while I was still working on

131
00:05:25,129 --> 00:05:27,199
this project actually I'll switch

132
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:27,770
forward

133
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:29,659
I was prototyping in Lego I have to

134
00:05:29,659 --> 00:05:31,310
figure out what the actuator is for each

135
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:34,400
one of those pins and I did a first

136
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,779
version in Lego and then I realized okay

137
00:05:35,779 --> 00:05:36,919
now that I have that working there

138
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:39,310
here's the clicker the linear actuator

139
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:41,509
but if I scale this out to thousands of

140
00:05:41,509 --> 00:05:43,939
pins wow this is going to be really

141
00:05:43,939 --> 00:05:47,000
really expensive so then I so I could

142
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,139
kind of put the project on hold for a

143
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:50,149
little bit I then went to a Maker Faire

144
00:05:50,149 --> 00:05:52,159
and discovered this project called grid

145
00:05:52,159 --> 00:05:53,960
beam this is for making for like

146
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:56,419
standing desks and tables and beds and

147
00:05:56,419 --> 00:05:58,129
all kinds of crazy things this is one of

148
00:05:58,129 --> 00:05:59,689
the co-inventors Richard Jorgensen he

149
00:05:59,689 --> 00:06:02,899
lives in Northern California and yeah

150
00:06:02,899 --> 00:06:04,189
this is a standing desk I'm kicking in

151
00:06:04,189 --> 00:06:05,599
the shins like yeah they should this is

152
00:06:05,599 --> 00:06:06,800
a really cool building material it's

153
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,110
like life-size like a rector set kind of

154
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:12,020
stuff anyway so I I knew of this project

155
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:13,729
and so like wait a second Lego is cool I

156
00:06:13,729 --> 00:06:15,469
like the geometry but it's expensive so

157
00:06:15,469 --> 00:06:17,360
I had this crazy idea it's like combine

158
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,249
Lego the geometry of it with grid beam

159
00:06:19,249 --> 00:06:22,810
basically report Lego geometry to

160
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:25,189
different you know cheaper materials and

161
00:06:25,189 --> 00:06:27,589
now I've got this thing again this thing

162
00:06:27,589 --> 00:06:29,659
is meant to be vertically vertically

163
00:06:29,659 --> 00:06:31,849
aligned for my pin thing project but

164
00:06:31,849 --> 00:06:33,259
then as I was walking around the house

165
00:06:33,259 --> 00:06:38,330
with this and you know I actually you

166
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:40,879
know held it upside down and kind of

167
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:42,379
noticed actually you know it could be a

168
00:06:42,379 --> 00:06:44,870
pin simulation thing but it also is kind

169
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:46,490
of like a glorified button clicker you

170
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:48,319
know and realizing that's kind of what

171
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:49,699
selenium that's what testing really is

172
00:06:49,699 --> 00:06:50,750
that's actually what makes testing

173
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:52,819
uncool as people that you pay probably

174
00:06:52,819 --> 00:06:54,800
offshore somewhere and just they just

175
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:55,999
pay to click buttons all day

176
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:57,529
it's like wait a second this potentially

177
00:06:57,529 --> 00:07:00,199
could be a button clicker and this is

178
00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:02,360
where it became not so much an art

179
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,889
project but potentially related to the

180
00:07:03,889 --> 00:07:07,069
day job so I designed this this robot

181
00:07:07,069 --> 00:07:09,799
basically the first version of it around

182
00:07:09,799 --> 00:07:13,369
around this clicker and so now I have

183
00:07:13,369 --> 00:07:14,809
got that this is actually generation 2

184
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:16,599
we see over here bit bean BOTS

185
00:07:16,599 --> 00:07:19,429
and of course you know testing you know

186
00:07:19,429 --> 00:07:21,529
selenium and apps that I tested

187
00:07:21,529 --> 00:07:23,329
originally you know time expense apps

188
00:07:23,329 --> 00:07:25,309
very boring makes for very boring demo

189
00:07:25,309 --> 00:07:26,689
but so trying to go for the most

190
00:07:26,689 --> 00:07:28,669
ridiculous thing I could think of I was

191
00:07:28,669 --> 00:07:30,079
like well if I can make it play Angry

192
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:32,539
Birds it can do anything right so that

193
00:07:32,539 --> 00:07:34,129
that was that was the mission make this

194
00:07:34,129 --> 00:07:37,599
robot clicker thing play Angry Birds and

195
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:39,919
so there's there's kind of the thing

196
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:40,939
I've realized in building ground of

197
00:07:40,939 --> 00:07:41,899
robots that's really kind of like a

198
00:07:41,899 --> 00:07:43,969
triathlon of things you need the

199
00:07:43,969 --> 00:07:45,889
electronics the mechanics and the

200
00:07:45,889 --> 00:07:48,169
software most of the stuff I think in

201
00:07:48,169 --> 00:07:49,519
this room we're mostly really geeking

202
00:07:49,519 --> 00:07:52,339
out on the Arduino and and the software

203
00:07:52,339 --> 00:07:54,649
side so the demo I have thanks to Chris

204
00:07:54,649 --> 00:07:56,689
Williams at the johnny-five and Fermata

205
00:07:56,689 --> 00:08:00,199
you know upskilled my software it was

206
00:08:00,199 --> 00:08:01,879
the latest node stuff the thing that

207
00:08:01,879 --> 00:08:03,499
struggle that I struggled with the most

208
00:08:03,499 --> 00:08:06,289
is all of our robots need skeletons so

209
00:08:06,289 --> 00:08:07,819
like the node copter stuff is cool but

210
00:08:07,819 --> 00:08:08,659
that's kind of an off-the-shelf

211
00:08:08,659 --> 00:08:11,059
proprietary thing and so for me to I

212
00:08:11,059 --> 00:08:12,649
want to do robots I want it to be a

213
00:08:12,649 --> 00:08:14,449
completely open source stack all the way

214
00:08:14,449 --> 00:08:16,399
down so the mechanics was I think I

215
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:18,769
really stumbled I stumbled on but now

216
00:08:18,769 --> 00:08:19,849
that I've created basically an

217
00:08:19,849 --> 00:08:23,419
open-source Lego I now can do the

218
00:08:23,419 --> 00:08:24,469
software the electronics and the

219
00:08:24,469 --> 00:08:26,360
mechanics all open source so that I

220
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,769
guess that's the way I called the bit

221
00:08:27,769 --> 00:08:30,729
beam project it's you know Linux is to

222
00:08:30,729 --> 00:08:34,969
Microsoft as bit beam is to Lego my only

223
00:08:34,969 --> 00:08:37,339
problem though is no one hates Lego I

224
00:08:37,339 --> 00:08:39,819
hope I picked a really bad enemy there

225
00:08:39,819 --> 00:08:42,139
but they do sue people they do that

226
00:08:42,139 --> 00:08:43,849
patents thankfully most of them all of

227
00:08:43,849 --> 00:08:47,269
them I hope most of them have expired so

228
00:08:47,269 --> 00:08:49,610
I I mean it is public domain they're

229
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:51,439
expired to expire patents at least so I

230
00:08:51,439 --> 00:08:53,180
can kind of a they don't they might sue

231
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:56,959
me anyway but we'll see you know so that

232
00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:59,569
there's this idea this this again I've

233
00:08:59,569 --> 00:09:00,920
said this before but you know selenium

234
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,149
and starting from that it's a software

235
00:09:02,149 --> 00:09:04,399
based robot it's really just a glorified

236
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:07,579
button clicker you know so you know

237
00:09:07,579 --> 00:09:09,410
could we make a robot that does that

238
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:09,860
does this

239
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:12,649
thing so long a dream for this then is

240
00:09:12,649 --> 00:09:14,839
to have the selenium API where and I

241
00:09:14,839 --> 00:09:16,040
don't have that today but you know at

242
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:18,079
some point you can say you know I want

243
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:20,200
to drive Firefox I want to drive Chrome

244
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:23,269
Safari or I want to drive an iPad in a

245
00:09:23,269 --> 00:09:24,560
robot and as far as you're concerned the

246
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,810
API is the same so I'm still driving

247
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:28,160
towards that vision right now it's

248
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:31,670
there's kind of low-level API is yes

249
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:42,829
let's switch to a demo so I'm using a

250
00:09:42,829 --> 00:09:45,079
photobooth it's inverted to the the

251
00:09:45,079 --> 00:09:50,480
screen here so let's get my windows all

252
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:54,980
set up so the first thing that you want

253
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:56,540
to do when you want to have a robot the

254
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:58,010
plaything Angry Birds you need to select

255
00:09:58,010 --> 00:10:08,390
the app right right so I'm in the app

256
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:16,019
and I know I will get to be the frontier

257
00:10:16,029 --> 00:10:19,190
right yes so one of the things this is

258
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:21,320
this generation 2 of this robot this is

259
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,240
actually called a Delta robot you could

260
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:25,720
perhaps see it here if I can kind of a

261
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:28,959
shall do a little tour of the robot here

262
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:31,040
there's three arms that's why it's

263
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,620
called a delta it was invented I can't

264
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:35,000
forget his name but it's actually a

265
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,779
Swiss engineer in the 80s and no joke he

266
00:10:38,779 --> 00:10:40,730
he designed you know the disc delta

267
00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:44,149
robot design too from Switzerland of

268
00:10:44,149 --> 00:10:45,829
course it was conveyor belts of

269
00:10:45,829 --> 00:10:47,449
chocolates coming off the conveyor belt

270
00:10:47,449 --> 00:10:48,410
and they're trying to get chocolates

271
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:51,350
into packages and they were noticing and

272
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:52,640
that everything was automated except

273
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,320
that last parts where the chocolates

274
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,300
were being picked up by humans and

275
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:57,470
putting in boxes like all could we do

276
00:10:57,470 --> 00:10:59,540
that so they needed as the conveyor belt

277
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:00,800
was going pretty fast they need a very

278
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,050
fast robot designed so as I was

279
00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:05,180
embarking on this video game robot thing

280
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:06,079
it needs to be fast

281
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:07,490
someone saw my first version of it so

282
00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:08,660
like wow that's really slow you should

283
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:10,279
check out a delta robot thankfully the

284
00:11:10,279 --> 00:11:11,959
patent has expired so hey I can I'm

285
00:11:11,959 --> 00:11:14,300
legally allowed to to build a delta so

286
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:16,279
anyway there's this thing so yeah it's

287
00:11:16,279 --> 00:11:18,110
it's kind of its kind of creepy cool

288
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:20,779
right yeah

289
00:11:20,779 --> 00:11:23,779
so keep going on with the demo here

290
00:11:23,779 --> 00:11:32,009
now for the big point actually hybrid

291
00:11:32,009 --> 00:11:35,339
manual testing right okay so uh I have

292
00:11:35,339 --> 00:11:38,040
to get into position I wonder if this is

293
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:43,730
actually work oh yeah sure

294
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:50,610
famous last words

295
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:58,430
[Applause]

296
00:11:58,430 --> 00:12:02,130
okay now once is just luck right so

297
00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:16,110
let's see if I can do it again wants I'm

298
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:24,450
lucky - I'm good let's see I improve my

299
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:28,950
score I think that was one star how many

300
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:31,110
stars do you think it is one - I think

301
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:33,120
that was one if you hit that if you hit

302
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:37,350
right that corner you get three only one

303
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:39,510
Sara okay so I've got I've got a room

304
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:43,590
for improvement right so so let me

305
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:45,120
actually show you a little bit actually

306
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,350
one of the things I just got working

307
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:50,570
today there's this really robotics is

308
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:53,040
ultimately very simple but they use if

309
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:56,520
you study robotics classes they've used

310
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:57,990
all these big words so you can sound

311
00:12:57,990 --> 00:12:59,730
very smart at a cocktail party but it's

312
00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:02,490
very simple stuff one thing is to tell a

313
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:06,090
robot to go to a point it's very simple

314
00:13:06,090 --> 00:13:07,530
like you don't even think about it as a

315
00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:08,580
human you just like oh I want to pick up

316
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:12,180
the glass boom that is a that fancy

317
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:13,860
phrase and robotics is called inverse

318
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:16,740
kinematics and I have an inverse

319
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:18,600
kinematics library I'll put on github

320
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,220
after the talk and there's really kind

321
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:22,050
of there's two things in robotic lands

322
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:23,370
there's inverse kinematics basically

323
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:25,380
saying like there's an XYZ point in the

324
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:26,940
universe I want to get to it that's what

325
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:28,410
you have to do is like your robot

326
00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:30,240
doesn't know about anything about

327
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,500
geometry in the world but it knows that

328
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,720
it's got a motor that can go 180 degrees

329
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,850
and this motor can go this and so what

330
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:38,130
you have to do the inverse kinematics is

331
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:41,100
this is to say given an XYZ point in the

332
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:44,790
universe what are the angles for all of

333
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:47,760
the motors to get to that location so

334
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,830
I've I've had this robot actually for

335
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:51,600
you know a couple months now but I've

336
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,060
had a very low level API I granted all

337
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:55,230
these go commands that's pretty low

338
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:56,670
level but it's higher than it was a

339
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:59,460
couple hours ago what I can do then is

340
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:01,170
just give it a particular location and

341
00:14:01,170 --> 00:14:03,150
then it figures out this very fancy

342
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:06,600
algorithm translates that to what the

343
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,340
server's need to go to so if I can I can

344
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:10,740
do some simple things now again it's X Y

345
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:11,459
Z so

346
00:14:11,459 --> 00:14:16,319
so the origin is in the sensor and I'll

347
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:18,600
see you naked 1 120 that's in the z-axis

348
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:21,990
and I can kind of go there and if I want

349
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:25,019
to go down I can kind of keep doing that

350
00:14:25,019 --> 00:14:26,759
that the surface or the tablets right

351
00:14:26,759 --> 00:14:30,929
around 150 I'll so I'll just keep it to

352
00:14:30,929 --> 00:14:33,329
keep it safe there's that so you can

353
00:14:33,329 --> 00:14:36,329
kind of see the input go is X Y Z and

354
00:14:36,329 --> 00:14:38,480
the output is going to be the angles

355
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:41,369
that the servos need to be when it's on

356
00:14:41,369 --> 00:14:43,230
the origin they're effectively all the

357
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:46,850
same but if I go you know often in

358
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:50,610
Cartesian on a Keynesian adventure

359
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:56,369
that's negative 50 X and that's plus 50

360
00:14:56,369 --> 00:15:03,480
X or I can do that's why and then

361
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:07,350
negative Y so now I have like anywhere

362
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:09,209
in the X Y Z plane I've got I've got the

363
00:15:09,209 --> 00:15:12,480
that I've got the power right also

364
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,300
because of the kinematics the

365
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:16,079
calculating forward it's a little bit

366
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:17,579
opposite of what I would think would be

367
00:15:17,579 --> 00:15:20,459
but so you got inverse kinematics

368
00:15:20,459 --> 00:15:24,149
forward kinematics means I am here tell

369
00:15:24,149 --> 00:15:26,369
me what the position of my servos or

370
00:15:26,369 --> 00:15:32,639
what my angles are so I could do the

371
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:34,889
count the forward kinematics and I'll

372
00:15:34,889 --> 00:15:43,139
just say it's what 1.5 41 41 that was

373
00:15:43,139 --> 00:15:45,869
roughly the the output from the last

374
00:15:45,869 --> 00:15:50,189
function and it should inverse it yeah

375
00:15:50,189 --> 00:15:53,569
roughly zero 50 negative 20 anyway

376
00:15:53,569 --> 00:15:55,799
rounding errors right but you can go

377
00:15:55,799 --> 00:15:58,439
forward and back for me I needed it's

378
00:15:58,439 --> 00:16:00,869
really important to have the XYZ thing

379
00:16:00,869 --> 00:16:04,799
so so future steps for this project if

380
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:05,879
you kind of noticed some people are

381
00:16:05,879 --> 00:16:06,990
saying like well how do I know where to

382
00:16:06,990 --> 00:16:09,059
tell this robot this is a another thing

383
00:16:09,059 --> 00:16:11,069
in robot lands this is an open-loop

384
00:16:11,069 --> 00:16:12,600
right which means I'm telling it to go

385
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,899
somewhere and it really doesn't know

386
00:16:14,899 --> 00:16:17,730
anything it's not very smart there is no

387
00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:20,189
feedback mechanism from the robots to

388
00:16:20,189 --> 00:16:22,470
back to the computer to say like oh you

389
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:24,059
told me to go here but I'm actually here

390
00:16:24,059 --> 00:16:24,780
and

391
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:25,890
let's course-correct to get to the right

392
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:28,470
spot so one of the things I'm also

393
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:30,840
working on is then using Peter Braden's

394
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:33,600
OpenCV bindings for node and that's

395
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,100
where things get really cool with an

396
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:40,230
iPad 2 and up and and the iPhone 4s and

397
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:42,870
up you can get a VGA adapter and get a

398
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:45,090
mirror to get a video signal out of of

399
00:16:45,090 --> 00:16:48,330
the iPad once I have that actually use a

400
00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:51,300
device called prosaically named VGA to

401
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:53,790
USB right so it takes the VGA signal and

402
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:55,530
then I plug it into my laptop so now I

403
00:16:55,530 --> 00:16:58,320
actually can grab like JPEG frames of of

404
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:01,410
this of the iPad screen once I have that

405
00:17:01,410 --> 00:17:03,390
I can use open a CV and I have a little

406
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:05,370
thumbnail picture where I can find the

407
00:17:05,370 --> 00:17:07,290
bird on that screen open computer vision

408
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:09,570
algorithms can can translate this bird

409
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:12,090
to a particular XYZ coordinate on the

410
00:17:12,090 --> 00:17:14,310
screen once I have that XYZ coordinate I

411
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:15,840
can then feed it into this inverse

412
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:18,660
kinematics function and then and then go

413
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:20,910
so the other dream for this is I can sit

414
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:22,650
back and then watch it completely you

415
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:24,540
know play by itself and then on top of

416
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:26,610
that then once we have a robot that's

417
00:17:26,610 --> 00:17:27,980
kind of sort of autonomous and

418
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:30,150
course-correcting we can then start

419
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:32,100
having competitions about Angry Birds

420
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:34,500
playing robot you know efficiency and

421
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:35,940
you know find the pig find the bird

422
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:37,800
figure out the angle you know how far to

423
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:41,520
throw so I envision Angry Birds robot

424
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,530
contests in the future like is make it

425
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:46,700
as ridiculous as possible but yeah

426
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:49,860
there's lots of things there's lots of

427
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:52,740
things that we can do with this and one

428
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:54,510
thing I think after after my talk I'm

429
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:57,060
gonna go back back to the coffee spots

430
00:17:57,060 --> 00:17:59,430
but I need I need to help I need you

431
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:02,850
might I need your help implementing the

432
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:06,540
tweet function so I want you know by the

433
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:08,700
end of it today get this robot to just

434
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:09,600
you know say hello

435
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,060
J s conf and then the key thing is a

436
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:15,360
sent for my robot so that's that yeah

437
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:20,280
that's coming coming very soon but yeah

438
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:22,560
anyway so the inverse kinematics and all

439
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:24,150
that all this robot stuff there are some

440
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:27,270
really good classes at Stanford they put

441
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:28,410
them all online

442
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:32,640
iTunes University and I thought I was

443
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:33,840
really interested in robotics you know

444
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,700
like a long time ago but because I

445
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:37,530
didn't have a project to do something it

446
00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:38,610
was very dry very

447
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:40,049
boring material I think this is one of

448
00:18:40,049 --> 00:18:41,790
those lessons learned of college because

449
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:43,640
I didn't have a project to work on I

450
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,390
couldn't even I couldn't survive the

451
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:47,490
first class but now I now I need these

452
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:49,799
functions I now I now get it but don't

453
00:18:49,799 --> 00:18:51,870
get scared by the science and the

454
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:53,820
vocabulary just realize a lot of this

455
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:54,809
stuff is very simple

456
00:18:54,809 --> 00:18:56,850
I mean robots are ridiculously stupid

457
00:18:56,850 --> 00:18:58,440
even at this level they're not very

458
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:00,000
smart and so the things that we're

459
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,490
trying them to do to get them to do it's

460
00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:06,480
it's just geometry and and thankfully

461
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,559
lots of other people's you can kind of

462
00:19:07,559 --> 00:19:10,980
uh grab people's algorithms and run them

463
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:18,789
in your stuff and get them to work but

464
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:21,150
so at this point actually I think I

465
00:19:21,150 --> 00:19:26,810
would like to open it to questions yeah

466
00:19:26,810 --> 00:19:41,630
[Applause]

467
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:52,170
there yeah oh holy cow I forgots

468
00:19:52,170 --> 00:20:00,310
thank you so much yeah Chris Williams

469
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:01,960
actually implemented this last night the

470
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:06,460
dancing robots and then let's see if you

471
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:07,600
want to like take a break and chill

472
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:13,600
right I just stopped was that dance Oh

473
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,290
oh shoot right can't see it there you go

474
00:20:16,290 --> 00:20:17,620
thank you

475
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:22,120
let's try that again

476
00:20:22,130 --> 00:20:27,910
[Applause]

477
00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:33,380
so Chris also if he he got the the week

478
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:35,150
controller we got it working so we can

479
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:36,170
actually can kind of play the video game

480
00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:38,570
you know abstracted through throw all

481
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:40,190
this so you can show that to see the

482
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:41,320
demo later

483
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:49,460
any other questions what was that is the

484
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:51,290
code for this I just went to the get the

485
00:20:51,290 --> 00:20:53,750
bit beam repo but that's for the yeah

486
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:55,370
for this demo right now I'll put that up

487
00:20:55,370 --> 00:20:57,440
right after thank you right I want to

488
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,360
see it it's Johnny 5 stuff Johnny 5

489
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:03,590
right it's okay Johnny 5 is the robot is

490
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:05,840
the node library and then Fermata is on

491
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:14,360
the arduino side yeah how much does this

492
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:19,600
thing cost approximately oh right so

493
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,500
it's a lot cheaper that you're gonna do

494
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:22,820
it in Lego and also the other thing is

495
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:27,190
Lego doesn't make parts like this long

496
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:29,680
so it's actually about a hundred dollars

497
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:32,780
and most of it actually is the Arduino

498
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:34,460
their Arduino in the in a prototyping

499
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:36,920
board that's like 30 or 40 the servos

500
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:40,160
each hurt 10 apiece so just in

501
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:41,990
electronics actually 2/3 the cost is

502
00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:44,210
just the electronics the wood and the

503
00:21:44,210 --> 00:21:46,700
bolts are probably like maybe 10 15

504
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:49,220
dollars or so and that little iPad

505
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:51,830
stylus I overpaid and got it at Best Buy

506
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:53,270
or something like that I could I could

507
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:57,230
make my own dirt cheap there's actually

508
00:21:57,230 --> 00:22:02,000
one I did put this project up on there's

509
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,170
a website called tindy TI n di e.com

510
00:22:06,170 --> 00:22:09,410
it's kind of like an electronics version

511
00:22:09,410 --> 00:22:12,320
of Etsy where you can kind of put your

512
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:13,460
project up there

513
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:15,470
granted it's it's for sale but I don't

514
00:22:15,470 --> 00:22:19,930
want you to buy it because I'm really

515
00:22:19,930 --> 00:22:23,120
it's a manual process to make this right

516
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,800
so what I need to do next is to make the

517
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,240
robots that can make this robot so I

518
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,850
need a conveyor belts and any more bit

519
00:22:28,850 --> 00:22:30,230
beams that can I can shake the bolts

520
00:22:30,230 --> 00:22:31,640
onto the conveyor belt I can find the

521
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:33,380
bolts put them in a kit so I haven't

522
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:35,960
done that yet so that's there but yeah

523
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:39,020
so the you know plans are out there I've

524
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:41,210
documented like a whole Flickr set

525
00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:43,159
for all the construction steps for this

526
00:22:43,159 --> 00:22:46,850
and yeah it's about $100 I laser cut the

527
00:22:46,850 --> 00:22:50,390
wood at TechShop San Francisco so if you

528
00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:51,649
have it if you have access to an

529
00:22:51,649 --> 00:22:53,360
epilogue laser cutter you can kind of

530
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:57,140
you know buy the wood at a and this is

531
00:22:57,140 --> 00:22:58,190
actually just two foot lengths of

532
00:22:58,190 --> 00:23:01,570
basswood for like ninety nine cents and

533
00:23:01,570 --> 00:23:05,179
learn how to laser cut and and do it the

534
00:23:05,179 --> 00:23:06,799
thing though I think the laser cutting

535
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:09,950
is also to to manual to labor intensive

536
00:23:09,950 --> 00:23:12,799
the better idea is to download the the

537
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:16,070
bit beam file from the Thingiverse so I

538
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:17,899
have the cool thing about open source

539
00:23:17,899 --> 00:23:19,070
and the thing I think of versus all

540
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:21,950
these things I uploaded the the 2d DXF

541
00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:23,750
laser cut files and within an hour of

542
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:25,669
being on Thingiverse someone uploaded

543
00:23:25,669 --> 00:23:28,370
the the 3d version that can is RepRap

544
00:23:28,370 --> 00:23:30,830
printable and so this was this is ABS

545
00:23:30,830 --> 00:23:35,330
plastic on the same as Lego and anyways

546
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:36,740
pretty cool so I think actually the the

547
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:37,909
best way to if you're gonna make your

548
00:23:37,909 --> 00:23:39,860
own is you know get the electronics from

549
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:41,299
wherever the Arduino and the servos

550
00:23:41,299 --> 00:23:42,770
that's kind of been known how to do that

551
00:23:42,770 --> 00:23:45,529
spark fun or something but I would

552
00:23:45,529 --> 00:23:47,000
recommend getting a 3d printer getting

553
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,140
the bit beam files and then just

554
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:49,880
printing a bunch of them so that yeah

555
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:52,730
that the dream I think is you know

556
00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:54,740
besides robots they actually can you

557
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:56,380
know be the equivalent of selenium and

558
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:58,669
test all your software the other one is

559
00:23:58,669 --> 00:24:01,029
to kind of imagine a toy company that's

560
00:24:01,029 --> 00:24:02,779
it's kind of like a modern company

561
00:24:02,779 --> 00:24:04,970
instead of a factory in some country

562
00:24:04,970 --> 00:24:07,370
where I make stuff for you and send it

563
00:24:07,370 --> 00:24:09,529
to you for a ridiculously high price

564
00:24:09,529 --> 00:24:11,600
imagine there are just 3 D printers

565
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,460
everywhere and so there's you know

566
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:15,020
building up a community of people to

567
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:17,179
putting kits up on the website and then

568
00:24:17,179 --> 00:24:18,860
that has the instructions on how you can

569
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:20,539
print it and so you can send an entire

570
00:24:20,539 --> 00:24:23,960
you know bill of materials to your

571
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,220
printer and just say you know in the

572
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:26,510
morning you now have your own kind of

573
00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:28,490
Lego kit and didn't have to you know

574
00:24:28,490 --> 00:24:29,809
wait for shipping and handling for that

575
00:24:29,809 --> 00:24:31,640
kind of stuff so yeah that's kind of the

576
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:33,890
dream so you can make it yourself or at

577
00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:34,909
some point once they have the whole

578
00:24:34,909 --> 00:24:40,850
robot assembly line I'll go - yep

579
00:24:40,850 --> 00:24:43,070
so can you tell us about controlling

580
00:24:43,070 --> 00:24:44,480
that with like a Wii controller maybe

581
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,940
later later the Wii controller yeah

582
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:49,690
because that was pretty cool

583
00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:51,889
yeah all probably going to I'll go into

584
00:24:51,889 --> 00:24:55,040
that I'll go into yeah I'll let fly me

585
00:24:55,040 --> 00:25:01,690
laughter yes yes any other questions

586
00:25:01,690 --> 00:25:04,400
okay thank you thanks
