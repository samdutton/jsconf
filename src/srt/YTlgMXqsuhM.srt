1
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:21,510

you

2
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:25,250


3
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:28,920
hello everybody my name is wonderful

4
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:32,700
German it's tim Messerschmitt I hate it

5
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:35,790
and today my talk is going to be open

6
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:39,050
identity getting to know your users and

7
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:41,309
basically the cool stuff that you can do

8
00:00:41,309 --> 00:00:44,850
with that so as you got mentioned

9
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:46,890
already I'm a developer evangelist at

10
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:49,500
paper and whenever I turn up at the j

11
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,510
has come for something people like what

12
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:55,620
paper we so what does people actually do

13
00:00:55,620 --> 00:01:00,089
at jas comp paper used to be a bank

14
00:01:00,089 --> 00:01:02,220
right like but that's one of those

15
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:04,860
companies running c c++ in their back

16
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:07,170
and having really awkward you eyes and

17
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:10,049
stuff like that that was with our ode

18
00:01:10,049 --> 00:01:11,940
CEO so then a new guy called David

19
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:14,370
Marcus showing that being a startup guy

20
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:18,240
and he decided let's throw all of that

21
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,640
stuff away and hire some great people so

22
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,440
we had people like Jack rock for joining

23
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:24,630
us we've got bills god no with us and

24
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:26,820
those guys decided to create something

25
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:29,940
amazing so our new back end is basically

26
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:32,970
running on no Jas we use dust for data

27
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:36,000
binding we use backbone so lots of cool

28
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,980
stuff that you guys use in your project

29
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:42,080
are now running on all scale as well so

30
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:48,720
about my talk first of all you can go to

31
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,640
develop a paper come but this is not

32
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,920
going to be about paper products now

33
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:55,920
this is going to be about different of

34
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,040
my identity technology that's a off of

35
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,370
one a up my ID connect almighty browse

36
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:05,010
ID all that stuff that helps you to

37
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:08,580
create great user experience so what

38
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:11,879
really is identity I think the best way

39
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:15,180
to explain anything is using Lego and

40
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:21,480
using ninjas so I heard a yeah thanks so

41
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:25,409
on the interwebs I can be whoever I want

42
00:02:25,409 --> 00:02:28,709
right like I go to a web service I go to

43
00:02:28,709 --> 00:02:31,379
any site I were just on my account and I

44
00:02:31,379 --> 00:02:34,049
say my name is mr. T I'm wearing big

45
00:02:34,049 --> 00:02:36,610
golden chains I don't like flying around

46
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:39,640
I'm basically part of the 18 how can you

47
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:44,170
prove that you can't really write also

48
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:47,080
for some use cases I want to really be

49
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:50,620
me because it might be that this is

50
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:52,900
closely connected to things like

51
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:56,530
shipping items to me and then I want to

52
00:02:56,530 --> 00:02:58,150
make sure that I really prove my

53
00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:01,090
identity so these are some of the things

54
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:03,490
that I'm talking about and also I want

55
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:05,050
to talk about how to bring this

56
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:06,970
technology how to bring stuff like oh

57
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:09,910
off and to not just be logging in

58
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:12,040
context but also into stuff like API

59
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:15,459
communication so if you have any

60
00:03:15,459 --> 00:03:16,959
questions during the talk feel free to

61
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:18,580
reach out to me but also are they

62
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:21,430
available after this session to discuss

63
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:27,940
anything so lots of people use identity

64
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:31,630
always the same way they go to a web

65
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:32,770
service way to use the mobile

66
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:34,690
application and what they do is I use

67
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:38,080
Twitter Google+ or Facebook all the time

68
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,840
mostly it's even the same service the

69
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,519
reason for that is they don't really

70
00:03:42,519 --> 00:03:44,920
care we just share the details and we

71
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:47,470
want to log in quickly right the issue

72
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:51,340
is should we really do that like should

73
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:53,320
you always expose the same identity and

74
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:55,060
does it always make sense to use the

75
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:58,410
same identity I don't really think so

76
00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:01,830
also I want to cover some slides

77
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:04,540
annoyances that I see people often

78
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:07,239
confuses the topic authentication versus

79
00:04:07,239 --> 00:04:11,440
authorization so authentic Asian that's

80
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:13,840
what you might expect from stuff like oh

81
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:18,070
my d browse ID so authentication

82
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:20,560
technology is about proving that the

83
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,660
person logging in at the service or the

84
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:25,600
person using resources is actually you

85
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,250
so that's really about identity while

86
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:32,830
authorization is mostly about sharing

87
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:36,700
resources so that could be your direct

88
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:38,800
message is a Twitter that could be your

89
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,080
Google+ stream that could be lots of

90
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,729
different stuff like facebook image

91
00:04:42,729 --> 00:04:45,370
upload anything thats basically can do

92
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:47,349
interactions with an api could be a

93
00:04:47,349 --> 00:04:48,620
resource

94
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:53,389
the issue is due to be mixed up nature

95
00:04:53,389 --> 00:04:54,919
and messed up nature of identity

96
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:57,710
products often authorization gets

97
00:04:57,710 --> 00:05:00,680
misused to use a bit basically to

98
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:03,800
authentication so that is something like

99
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:06,320
an endpoint / profile me something like

100
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:09,680
that that works kinda but it's not like

101
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:13,820
how it should be so let's have a look at

102
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:15,440
the current standards in order to

103
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,440
understand where we are what's coming up

104
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:22,880
and what you maybe should we think so

105
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,970
basic off is quite known right like we

106
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:29,780
pass it as a header then we have the

107
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:32,660
base64 encoding or you can pass it in

108
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:35,150
the URL this is basically really like

109
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:37,160
passing your client ID and be secret

110
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:39,110
your username and password anything like

111
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:43,370
that that was kind of suitable but it's

112
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:49,160
not really secure now in 2007 define a

113
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:52,120
draft for something off 1 got released

114
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:57,080
whoever implemented all of one who liked

115
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:03,710
it see same happened to me so my

116
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:05,330
background is actually I'm coming from

117
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:08,150
the Android world and I was forced to do

118
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:10,789
some JavaScript and I it really turned

119
00:06:10,789 --> 00:06:14,900
out I kind of liked it and while on

120
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:16,760
android is was really because it

121
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,410
was Java that you had to use on

122
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:20,419
JavaScript you at least have amazing

123
00:06:20,419 --> 00:06:22,130
libraries nowadays like passport that

124
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:25,550
help you but still 0 of 1 is kind of

125
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:29,240
clunky so lots of interesting people

126
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,639
like Aaron hammer were included in this

127
00:06:31,639 --> 00:06:33,470
Aaron hammer was one of the contributors

128
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:37,520
at I ATF and you will see this named

129
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:40,160
Nate anonymous lights so lots of

130
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:43,599
companies like Twitter Yahoo Google

131
00:06:43,599 --> 00:06:47,330
started to use of one because it allows

132
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:50,210
users to actually use the google account

133
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:53,000
at other services to use data from that

134
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,550
so basically it allowed to have a much

135
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:58,969
nicer login experience and login

136
00:06:58,969 --> 00:07:00,289
experience is really something that

137
00:07:00,289 --> 00:07:01,210
matters

138
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:05,990
now sadly in 2009 there was a big issue

139
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:09,590
we come to that but first of all let's

140
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:11,540
have a look at the flow it's totally

141
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:14,570
convenient so people first of all have

142
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:16,850
to request something they call a week

143
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:18,830
rest toten that's on the consumer which

144
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:21,230
is basically client side and you have on

145
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:22,790
the right side B service provider so

146
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:24,830
that might be Twitter that might be

147
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:27,890
Google Facebook whatever you want now

148
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:30,470
after this token got generated and got

149
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:33,590
returned to the consumer the user is

150
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:36,200
going to be redirected to the service

151
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,600
provider he has to log in then depending

152
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:41,270
on the flow he might get something what

153
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:43,190
it was called Auto B which was basically

154
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:45,200
a code that he could copy-paste into

155
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,990
another window again or you could use

156
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:50,530
something they call verification code

157
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:53,360
basically to obtain the authorization so

158
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,420
user logs in says yes with application

159
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:59,150
should definitely have all my images so

160
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:02,480
I login then this funny authorization

161
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:05,990
token gets generated and on my console

162
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:08,660
my side I'm going to exchange that thing

163
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:11,330
for something we call access token so

164
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:13,550
again we talked to the service provider

165
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:16,040
and the service provider make sure that

166
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:19,640
this is still the valid user sounds kind

167
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:22,130
of good right and then with the access

168
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:24,169
token being returned to my consumer I

169
00:08:24,169 --> 00:08:26,330
can do things like requesting resources

170
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:29,600
so far so good but all of one had some

171
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:35,240
flaws initially the client got the

172
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:38,570
redirect URI so we're basically the

173
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:40,610
service provider should lead you after

174
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:43,070
doing things like the authorization in

175
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:45,830
the second step so the user got

176
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:49,360
redirected to beside that you provided

177
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,820
but what if a counter-attack would be

178
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:57,260
done so people could actually use this

179
00:08:57,260 --> 00:09:00,650
redirect URI and get the needed

180
00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:04,100
authorization code and basically hijack

181
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:06,730
your identity which is not really nice

182
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:10,070
so they came up in this this thing

183
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:14,270
called oh of one dot a or 10 a whatever

184
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:14,960
you like

185
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:18,680
and the idea was we move this now and to

186
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:20,870
be first step so you cannot just easily

187
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:23,840
modify the officer flow and therefore

188
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:26,450
it's much more secure and actually kind

189
00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:30,830
of worked but having a look at this it's

190
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:32,810
kind of complex there's a lot of steps

191
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:36,230
involved and the issues this was not

192
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:37,730
really designed the things like mobile

193
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:39,740
and minds this was not designed with

194
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:42,140
things like embedded systems in mind so

195
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:44,660
it had to be simplified and there had to

196
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:49,510
be more scenarios so oh of two came up

197
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:52,430
so this was definitely focused on

198
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:55,130
simplicity this was focused on things

199
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:57,710
like different scenarios define a

200
00:09:57,710 --> 00:10:01,090
framework basically released in 2012 and

201
00:10:01,090 --> 00:10:04,040
everything seemed to be amazing it uses

202
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:06,710
bearer tokens which basically are used

203
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:08,750
to do the authorization via the header

204
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:11,030
it was much easier than all of one

205
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:13,250
because of one without using a library

206
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:15,890
on the client side was a huge pain so

207
00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:20,260
whoever implemented off to client side

208
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:24,290
did you like it more than off one it's

209
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:26,840
much easier really basically if you

210
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,520
understand how to set one single header

211
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:31,490
that's it that's all you need it's much

212
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:36,880
easier sadly there were again issues

213
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:42,260
let's have a look at the flow so instead

214
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:44,510
of doing something like generating this

215
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:47,330
request token that's kind of not really

216
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:49,910
is authorized we direct the user

217
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:53,180
immediately to the service again we

218
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:56,540
obtained the authorization again we get

219
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:58,700
the access token and we use that thing

220
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:01,700
to request resources like your profile

221
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:05,540
and stuff like that so they got rid of

222
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:08,240
one whole step so there's this thing

223
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,950
called free leg or off and there's this

224
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:12,320
pin code to let go off and that's

225
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,720
basically what you see over here so if

226
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:18,460
you depend basically compare this

227
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:22,610
against this it's much easier and this

228
00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:24,410
is why you don't have to feel around so

229
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:27,620
much with libraries anymore because it

230
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:28,620
gots basically

231
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:32,280
designed with easiness in mind now the

232
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:37,020
issue again is 0 of 2 was designed

233
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:41,910
initially beginning of 2009 2010 ITF is

234
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:45,060
kinda big as a group lots of companies

235
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:49,230
I'm being involved so one guy last year

236
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:53,430
released a really angry blog post who

237
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:58,160
saw that on hacker news so Aaron hammer

238
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,710
basically being one of the main guys

239
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:03,630
behind the whole or one thing behind the

240
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:06,750
oil or two thing at some point decided

241
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:09,510
which is all crap so they've been

242
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:12,990
designing this one big solution that

243
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:15,090
should help corporates that should help

244
00:12:15,090 --> 00:12:17,130
startups that should help independent

245
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:21,590
developers to quickly create things like

246
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:25,410
the authorization for your service the

247
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:28,980
big issue was there was basically too

248
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:30,660
many scenarios and too many people

249
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:34,920
involved and so his big statement was

250
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:38,010
that while off to basically being nice

251
00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:40,860
it's more than a it's just a blueprint

252
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:43,500
so basically it tells you you could do

253
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:44,790
it like that you could do it like that

254
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:47,100
but it's not really being concrete while

255
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,260
the off one specular aspects were really

256
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:52,920
concrete in nearly all details so Aaron

257
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:56,450
was really pissed off and that's right

258
00:12:56,450 --> 00:13:00,750
so there's another guy who does lots of

259
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:04,320
blog posts about security who does lots

260
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:08,010
of things like buck hunting his name is

261
00:13:08,010 --> 00:13:12,600
Igor Makarov and he wrote this other big

262
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,880
blog post about Oh of to being basically

263
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:18,330
a huge huge attack surface because

264
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:20,820
there's things like the access token so

265
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:24,720
the initial fault behind an access token

266
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,660
is once you have that thing you do stuff

267
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:30,480
like you throw it against you server to

268
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:33,840
get dark messages you throw it again v

269
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,790
server to do things like posting and you

270
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:38,280
tweet everything that you basically do

271
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:41,100
works with the same access token but

272
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:42,450
that thing doesn't really

273
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:46,260
hiya so if somebody manages to get your

274
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:49,260
cookie and he has access once to your

275
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:52,320
access token he has access to all your

276
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,720
resources and that's not really great

277
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:58,910
right so people came up with the idea

278
00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:02,850
they could make expiring tokens but that

279
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:05,640
doesn't still really solve the problem

280
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:07,500
right because it doesn't really matter

281
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,390
to me if I have two minutes access to

282
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:11,940
your resources or 10 hours if I have

283
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:15,210
access i can get your resources so there

284
00:14:15,210 --> 00:14:17,340
were lots of different discussions going

285
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:20,820
around or to being not secure enough and

286
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:24,570
off to being secure enough and basically

287
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:26,670
what you will see is if you have a look

288
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:29,640
at companies that use or to like Twitter

289
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:34,080
and Facebook or even mass as paper lots

290
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:36,410
of them do lots of service Heights

291
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:40,490
modifications around this blueprint so

292
00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:43,710
security implementations are possible

293
00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:46,230
but the protocol doesn't really tell you

294
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:48,840
how so you need to be really aware about

295
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:55,320
how to do that now we basically have now

296
00:14:55,320 --> 00:15:00,000
the big nice authorization so we could

297
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,020
get resources but initially off was

298
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:06,960
meant to be something an ominous so

299
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:10,890
whenever I login using off I don't want

300
00:15:10,890 --> 00:15:13,290
to grant you my username not my password

301
00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:15,590
I don't want to fill in lots of details

302
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:17,820
but at some point you might need that

303
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:20,760
because you want to implement a nice

304
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:23,580
user interface saying hi Tim it's

305
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:25,920
amazing to see you your black hair looks

306
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:29,180
great stuff like that I don't know so

307
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:34,380
identification meadows and details like

308
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:36,960
having a name date of birth creation

309
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,730
date I don't know like anything that

310
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:41,270
could be closely coupled to your account

311
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:45,660
can be valuable now especially things

312
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:47,340
like creation date for accounts are

313
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:49,620
interesting because you could think

314
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:52,980
about is an account that got created one

315
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:55,830
hour ago as valid as an account

316
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:59,760
God created four years ago and the

317
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:02,090
interesting thing about this is and

318
00:16:02,090 --> 00:16:04,860
scopes are being used to define the

319
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:06,840
resources that you want to access or be

320
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:09,120
attributes so scopes can be either

321
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:12,660
static so you define the Mons and your

322
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:14,930
application always get the same data our

323
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:18,750
scopes can be dynamic so while you

324
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:21,810
basically do the authentication part you

325
00:16:21,810 --> 00:16:23,340
can define that you want to have the

326
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:25,650
profile the profile plus via email

327
00:16:25,650 --> 00:16:27,600
things like that there's different ways

328
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,510
to define that because of two gives you

329
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:34,110
be freedom to define stuff and lots of

330
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:37,860
companies really do it different so this

331
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:40,820
is actually not a bad idea right now

332
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:44,190
identity products had a few issues o

333
00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:47,700
mighty it was meant to be amazing

334
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:50,070
because it was meant to really identify

335
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:55,230
you was developed in 2005 so it's kind

336
00:16:55,230 --> 00:16:59,970
of old again in 2012 there was one big

337
00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:02,700
buck being discovered which allowed to

338
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:05,699
hijack our fabrication so it was not

339
00:17:05,699 --> 00:17:08,730
really secure anymore and really just a

340
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:11,250
few days ago gen rain announced that

341
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:14,850
they stopped to use my almighty com so

342
00:17:14,850 --> 00:17:17,040
your central one identity for the

343
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:20,459
internet might be shut down so up my tea

344
00:17:20,459 --> 00:17:24,060
while being intentionally writes about

345
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:26,970
proving that it's you had this big flaw

346
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:30,270
it was really difficult to implement

347
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:33,270
this back was huge because it had things

348
00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:35,730
in there like out to discover ability

349
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:40,200
and it kind of didn't work so identity

350
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,240
still matters to lots of companies and

351
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,310
one company came up with a solution

352
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:48,060
called browse ID or persona name Mozilla

353
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:51,690
and that thing was launched in 2011 they

354
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:53,940
brought a new feature called identity

355
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:56,040
twittering which allows every Google a

356
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:58,440
user to login at this one central

357
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:01,140
service which might be again some

358
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:03,720
central identity service browser ID

359
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:06,600
being baked into your browser in Firefox

360
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,160
and I think there's also libraries for

361
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,070
other browsers

362
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:11,830
and persona being the one central

363
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:17,860
service in the web so we've learned that

364
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:19,659
there's authentication and we've learned

365
00:18:19,659 --> 00:18:23,320
there's authorization but how to combine

366
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:26,409
them both like really nicely not just

367
00:18:26,409 --> 00:18:30,519
being an off heck so the first solution

368
00:18:30,519 --> 00:18:33,009
was to come up with up my teeth of an

369
00:18:33,009 --> 00:18:37,000
extension for oauth which they call or

370
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,519
hybrid extension that thing got drafted

371
00:18:39,519 --> 00:18:43,330
down in 2009 but it relied on off one so

372
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:46,179
by definition it was to implement

373
00:18:46,179 --> 00:18:49,480
and sadly there were all these flows

374
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:53,620
like the of one flaw so why you

375
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:55,539
basically had access to resources and

376
00:18:55,539 --> 00:18:59,039
identity it's dependent on a bed

377
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:01,299
structure so it was not really great to

378
00:19:01,299 --> 00:19:05,980
use and then there is 0 mighty connect

379
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:08,500
which is still a draft but it gets lots

380
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:12,039
of things right so almighty connect is

381
00:19:12,039 --> 00:19:14,950
based on or off too and that's nice for

382
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:17,350
your authorization part and it adds a

383
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:19,629
big identity layer on top of that in

384
00:19:19,629 --> 00:19:22,299
order to make sure that you get a really

385
00:19:22,299 --> 00:19:25,299
nice resource friendly REST API friendly

386
00:19:25,299 --> 00:19:27,279
access to resources like your profile

387
00:19:27,279 --> 00:19:30,429
and one of the interesting things is

388
00:19:30,429 --> 00:19:32,470
that they implemented something they

389
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:35,230
call session management so on off

390
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:38,379
usually if you want to log out as a user

391
00:19:38,379 --> 00:19:40,389
you have to go to settings page

392
00:19:40,389 --> 00:19:41,980
somewhere hidden in the service and you

393
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:44,830
have to revoke token access lots of

394
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:46,450
people don't really know what it does so

395
00:19:46,450 --> 00:19:48,159
they just leave applications be forever

396
00:19:48,159 --> 00:19:50,679
and that's not really the best way to do

397
00:19:50,679 --> 00:19:54,429
it so on up mighty connect using this

398
00:19:54,429 --> 00:19:57,190
session management basically you have an

399
00:19:57,190 --> 00:20:00,009
additional endpoint / logo or whatever

400
00:20:00,009 --> 00:20:03,159
you want to name it that you can have in

401
00:20:03,159 --> 00:20:06,179
your UI that you can have as a user to

402
00:20:06,179 --> 00:20:09,070
end your own session and basically avoid

403
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:12,190
your token so we talking that somebody

404
00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:13,840
stored in the database wherever he

405
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:16,570
stored it cannot be used to access new

406
00:20:16,570 --> 00:20:19,120
information anymore so that's quite nice

407
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,980
and also I think need it

408
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:25,490
now I've been mentioning different

409
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:27,559
identity providers I've been mentioning

410
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:30,260
the social ones like Twitter like

411
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:32,540
Facebook like Google those are amazing

412
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:35,090
for lots of different use cases like

413
00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:37,610
games you see companies like SoundCloud

414
00:20:37,610 --> 00:20:40,250
implementing that that's awesome but

415
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:43,400
sometimes and use cases like e-commerce

416
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,559
that's where we come from you need more

417
00:20:45,559 --> 00:20:48,049
concrete data because anybody can put

418
00:20:48,049 --> 00:20:53,179
anything on Facebook right and so you

419
00:20:53,179 --> 00:20:56,210
always have to think about concrete data

420
00:20:56,210 --> 00:21:00,169
that you can use in your UI to improve

421
00:21:00,169 --> 00:21:03,169
user experience and also be nice thing

422
00:21:03,169 --> 00:21:05,360
about concrete data is you can rely on

423
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:08,419
it being verified because usually as an

424
00:21:08,419 --> 00:21:09,980
example if I login at eBay with my

425
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:11,690
paypal account and I have the wrong

426
00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:14,390
shipping address because I skipped lots

427
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:16,309
of big parts in the registration or

428
00:21:16,309 --> 00:21:18,320
something like that somebody adds gets

429
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,330
my package or nobody gets it so it

430
00:21:20,330 --> 00:21:23,330
doesn't really help one thing that I

431
00:21:23,330 --> 00:21:25,250
hate and that are really discover

432
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:27,080
nowadays in lots of services are

433
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:31,940
artificial barriers so that applies not

434
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:33,950
just to be bad but also negative native

435
00:21:33,950 --> 00:21:37,160
apps you go to the website and it says

436
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:39,049
login with facebook login everywhere

437
00:21:39,049 --> 00:21:41,720
whatever provider you want and if you

438
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:44,570
don't you cannot use we service I call

439
00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:47,780
that an artificial barrier because you

440
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:51,040
kind of make sure that this gatekeeper

441
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:53,900
keeps out all the users but some users

442
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:55,370
just want to have a sneak peek of your

443
00:21:55,370 --> 00:21:56,929
service want to understand what you

444
00:21:56,929 --> 00:21:59,480
actually really do and so it makes sense

445
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:03,020
to don't force all these resource

446
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:05,510
sharing things you want to encourage it

447
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:07,700
so you say if you log in again then you

448
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:09,440
get all your friends showing up and

449
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,840
stuff but at least make sure they can

450
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:15,350
see some of your service before now I've

451
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:18,169
been talking a lot of about the singers

452
00:22:18,169 --> 00:22:20,660
and on techniques about off and stuff

453
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:24,679
you might think yeah nice but why should

454
00:22:24,679 --> 00:22:27,620
I actually really use it so now I come

455
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:32,049
up with numbers people forget passwords

456
00:22:32,049 --> 00:22:35,240
there was this consultancy called blue

457
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:35,600
ink

458
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:38,230
they basically did the survey asking if

459
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:41,600
somebody would type in a security

460
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,510
question or would email his old password

461
00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:46,520
to his email account or something like

462
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:48,200
that basically resetting your password

463
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,900
kind of things and only forty-five

464
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:56,179
percent really said if I have to do that

465
00:22:56,179 --> 00:22:59,390
I'm not going to come back again people

466
00:22:59,390 --> 00:23:02,120
don't like to use passwords anymore may

467
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:04,460
like to use services that they have

468
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:08,450
anyway because if i define all my

469
00:23:08,450 --> 00:23:10,610
properties and attributes like my

470
00:23:10,610 --> 00:23:13,039
birthday my email address all that stuff

471
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:14,809
I don't want to come up with that stuff

472
00:23:14,809 --> 00:23:18,559
again it's basically slowing me down

473
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:20,120
because I want to access your

474
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:23,090
information and also especially when

475
00:23:23,090 --> 00:23:26,200
your mobile there might be so much

476
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:30,289
problems with error-prone data so if I

477
00:23:30,289 --> 00:23:32,179
have to enter my email address it might

478
00:23:32,179 --> 00:23:34,760
be wrong because I was in the tube stuff

479
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:39,280
like that just try to speed up things

480
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:42,799
there's another fact people think that

481
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:46,100
social sign is actually desirable they

482
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:48,140
have these profiles please use them

483
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:53,450
offer to use them at least now I've been

484
00:23:53,450 --> 00:23:55,309
talking about the whole user experience

485
00:23:55,309 --> 00:23:56,929
being it's nice that you use it and

486
00:23:56,929 --> 00:23:59,169
stuff but what else can you use

487
00:23:59,169 --> 00:24:02,780
authentication now for your JavaScript

488
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:07,250
guys jsonp might be known I hope so so

489
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:10,400
for cross-domain requests like getting

490
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,429
different scripts and other web services

491
00:24:12,429 --> 00:24:16,720
usually you use either course or JSP and

492
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,770
now you want to secure this

493
00:24:18,770 --> 00:24:22,870
communication and because Jason P is

494
00:24:22,870 --> 00:24:25,789
basically an attack vector because you

495
00:24:25,789 --> 00:24:29,299
open up your site to scripts and

496
00:24:29,299 --> 00:24:32,090
callbacks from other sites you want to

497
00:24:32,090 --> 00:24:33,740
secure that so that's where you can come

498
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:36,140
in with basic off again you saw that my

499
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:38,570
quest spoke about things like the nonce

500
00:24:38,570 --> 00:24:40,909
that you can pass for scripts those

501
00:24:40,909 --> 00:24:42,110
techniques really have to use

502
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:43,520
authentication in order to make sure

503
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:46,090
that your service day's really not

504
00:24:46,090 --> 00:24:48,350
attacked nice and

505
00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:53,169
fenced now course who knows course

506
00:24:53,169 --> 00:24:57,230
awesome so especially in the payment

507
00:24:57,230 --> 00:24:58,700
scene right now causes a thing there's

508
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:00,830
this thing going on they call PCI

509
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:03,410
compliance so whenever you accept credit

510
00:25:03,410 --> 00:25:06,169
card data in your service you need to be

511
00:25:06,169 --> 00:25:08,150
PCI compliant which means you have to

512
00:25:08,150 --> 00:25:10,850
store data in a predefined way you need

513
00:25:10,850 --> 00:25:12,500
to be certified which costs a lot of

514
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:15,710
money and companies like stripe came up

515
00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:17,630
with techniques that allow you to

516
00:25:17,630 --> 00:25:21,789
basically pass data directly to them and

517
00:25:21,789 --> 00:25:24,830
we didn't do the same with our API lots

518
00:25:24,830 --> 00:25:26,390
of other companies nowadays use

519
00:25:26,390 --> 00:25:28,789
cross-origin request sharing which

520
00:25:28,789 --> 00:25:31,570
basically make sure that you have

521
00:25:31,570 --> 00:25:33,740
something that works again be same

522
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:36,830
origin policy and again this is where

523
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:40,400
you could use things like of two so our

524
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:43,690
API is an example that now used the

525
00:25:43,690 --> 00:25:46,669
organization bearer token thing to

526
00:25:46,669 --> 00:25:50,120
basically pass a header with of two to

527
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:52,880
make sure that the payments API call is

528
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:57,200
secure so this is basically really easy

529
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:00,590
you these things like you do a basic

530
00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:02,750
authentication to get the auth token and

531
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:04,580
then you use you of talking to do any

532
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:07,130
payments cause lots of companies do that

533
00:26:07,130 --> 00:26:09,590
and I think it's actually kinda smart to

534
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:12,799
use the same technique for that now for

535
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:15,740
course you do things like modifying the

536
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:18,679
xhr by setting the access control

537
00:26:18,679 --> 00:26:23,299
headers so in your request you say where

538
00:26:23,299 --> 00:26:25,640
the origin comes from so that could be

539
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:27,799
your server that could be any other

540
00:26:27,799 --> 00:26:31,159
server and you say which other servers

541
00:26:31,159 --> 00:26:34,970
are allowed so you say that that these

542
00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:38,059
access control headers are set and

543
00:26:38,059 --> 00:26:40,970
therefore the API Bob calm thing from

544
00:26:40,970 --> 00:26:44,360
html5 rocks enables you to get the HR

545
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:46,520
back from that and that's amazing that

546
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:49,940
really helps so if you want to have a

547
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:52,250
look at api's that use that you can go

548
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:54,799
to github com github the users that for

549
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:57,559
their API and I think it's kind of a

550
00:26:57,559 --> 00:26:59,809
good technology and a trend that is

551
00:26:59,809 --> 00:27:01,350
desirable

552
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:05,970
now wrapping up things I think there's a

553
00:27:05,970 --> 00:27:08,190
big difference between authentication

554
00:27:08,190 --> 00:27:09,870
and authorization and people shouldn't

555
00:27:09,870 --> 00:27:14,400
just use of 22 heck identification into

556
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:18,150
the product identity obviously matters

557
00:27:18,150 --> 00:27:20,730
so it makes sense to not just offer one

558
00:27:20,730 --> 00:27:22,890
identity provider but several of them

559
00:27:22,890 --> 00:27:25,890
and also you might want to think about

560
00:27:25,890 --> 00:27:27,809
things like token-based API

561
00:27:27,809 --> 00:27:29,820
communication to co can secure your

562
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:33,570
client server communication don't keep

563
00:27:33,570 --> 00:27:36,690
your users out and now I'm really happy

564
00:27:36,690 --> 00:27:51,549
to have QA thanks
