1
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:41,080

this is just side note everybody's

2
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:43,120
curious i'm using the module picture

3
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,070
tube by a sub stack and like most sub

4
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:47,260
stack modules it's not been updated in

5
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:51,040
three years but seems to work okay you

6
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:52,720
just feed it a ping image and then it

7
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:56,220
spits out the ansi color codes for it so

8
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:58,630
so yeah my talk is called black magic

9
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:03,040
api's I am Josh McLain that's my email

10
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:04,329
pretty small down there at the bottom

11
00:01:04,329 --> 00:01:10,390
and my github URL it's just github com /

12
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:12,250
Patchett I go by Patchett most places

13
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:20,270
online yeah so I work at this company

14
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:24,520
it's pretty fun my talk today involves

15
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:27,370
this gentleman here you probably

16
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:29,409
recognize him mrs. Roy Roy fielding he's

17
00:01:29,409 --> 00:01:33,369
a very smart guys the author rest for

18
00:01:33,369 --> 00:01:35,400
those of you not in the know rest is a

19
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:39,159
set of API design constraints that kind

20
00:01:39,159 --> 00:01:42,790
of sits on top of HTTP and it dictates

21
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:45,850
the kind of relationships that we should

22
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:51,880
aspire to hold to hold our resources

23
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:54,250
accountable for maintaining between each

24
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:58,890
other so if i had like URL slash dogs

25
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:01,360
you can make reasonable expectations

26
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:04,390
about the kind of resources that exist

27
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:06,580
as descendants of a dog like maybe a dog

28
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:09,849
has an owner and that would be dog / dog

29
00:02:09,849 --> 00:02:14,139
ID / owner conceivably and it just makes

30
00:02:14,139 --> 00:02:15,430
it

31
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:17,959
almost empirical hat and navigate

32
00:02:17,959 --> 00:02:19,849
between related resources and that's

33
00:02:19,849 --> 00:02:22,250
cool so those obviously there's a lot

34
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:24,170
more that goes into rest and just that

35
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:26,239
I'm going kind of at a high level today

36
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:29,000
so if you are not familiar with rust or

37
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,549
if you're only curse we're so really

38
00:02:31,549 --> 00:02:33,799
familiar with it you want to use it for

39
00:02:33,799 --> 00:02:35,030
your own api's I highly recommend

40
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:40,579
reading Roy Fielding's thesis he's he's

41
00:02:40,579 --> 00:02:42,680
not much of a humorist but it's it's

42
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:47,180
still an interesting interesting read so

43
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:49,099
a lot of people obviously a lot of

44
00:02:49,099 --> 00:02:51,109
people are using rusty pies it's just

45
00:02:51,109 --> 00:02:53,390
it's generally accepted in our

46
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:56,900
profession that it's a good way to style

47
00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:00,349
an API and to flesh it out but I have

48
00:03:00,349 --> 00:03:03,290
bad news and a lot of you that are that

49
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:05,090
are veteran conference attendees

50
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:06,530
probably have heard this already but

51
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:09,920
I'll say it again that's that most like

52
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,480
ninety nine percent of people that have

53
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:13,730
implemented a REST API hadn't

54
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:17,239
implemented a truly restful api there's

55
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:19,849
one particular implementation detail

56
00:03:19,849 --> 00:03:22,910
that Roy fielding mentions and it is

57
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:32,810
called right so is that old programming

58
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:34,760
adage that there's two hard things in

59
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:41,389
programming cash and validation and so I

60
00:03:41,389 --> 00:03:43,459
I mean in his defense Roy fielding big

61
00:03:43,459 --> 00:03:47,810
get cash and validation right so anyway

62
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:54,669
yeah hate or ass it's a so fun to say

63
00:03:54,669 --> 00:03:57,760
very very strict academical

64
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,750
representation going on here he throws

65
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:02,060
all the all the articles all the

66
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:03,829
prepositions in there it could be hates

67
00:04:03,829 --> 00:04:06,169
I mean think about how much easier that

68
00:04:06,169 --> 00:04:07,190
would be like we know it's an

69
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:09,560
application we could drop that we could

70
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:13,340
drop the of I feel like that would read

71
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:15,379
a lot better in PB so I feel like that's

72
00:04:15,379 --> 00:04:17,000
part of the reason why nobody really

73
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,260
even knows what this is is that the

74
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:22,729
acronym is so god-awful anyway so what

75
00:04:22,729 --> 00:04:24,919
is this this is like I said it's a

76
00:04:24,919 --> 00:04:27,510
specific constraint within

77
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:31,090
within rest and what it what it dictates

78
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:33,610
is that the resources that you return

79
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:38,800
should be linkable together via

80
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,920
hypertext and sometimes you see

81
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:45,520
hypermedia and so what does that mean

82
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,380
that's kind of a mouthful hypertext is

83
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:49,060
the engine of application state you

84
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:50,920
don't want to have to say that at a

85
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:54,370
party so basically what that means is

86
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:58,630
that the responses that your API returns

87
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:01,590
the body of your response or something

88
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:05,070
like earlier I said if I have dogs / 123

89
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:08,920
that should not only should that return

90
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,960
information about that dog like maybe

91
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,820
it's got its further color maybe it's

92
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:17,410
got its breed stuff like that it should

93
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:22,660
also return links like URLs to related

94
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:24,640
resources like I said maybe that dogs

95
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:29,430
got an owner dog / 123 / owner and if

96
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:31,780
we're just coming to this API without

97
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:33,460
having the documentation manual sitting

98
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:36,210
on our hotel coffee table next to us we

99
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:38,680
might not necessarily ever figure out

100
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:41,340
that that dog has an owner that we can

101
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:44,800
learn more about so this basically just

102
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,430
dictates hey have some representation of

103
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:51,550
the related models within the resources

104
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:53,740
that you pipe down so that people can

105
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:55,810
without having a document like having

106
00:05:55,810 --> 00:05:58,750
the documentation for it be able to

107
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:01,750
navigate related resources I think

108
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:05,170
that's pretty cool um so I wrote a

109
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:11,820
couple libraries once for humans and and

110
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:14,830
basically so there's this I think

111
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:20,830
there's an accepted and accepted well

112
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:22,120
I'll just say it's like the prevailing

113
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:24,070
opinion among people that right recipe

114
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:29,540
guys that doing hey

115
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:33,810
is not really worth it I mean you have

116
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:35,670
to there's obviously there's an

117
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:37,410
additional payload size for like

118
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:38,880
flushing out all these links and maybe

119
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:43,050
have a lot of them and then you have the

120
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:44,850
computational overhead of adding these

121
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:48,150
to every resource that you pipe down and

122
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:50,250
we see I mean what are we going to do

123
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:51,630
which they're going to it's more work to

124
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:54,300
write an API around resources that we

125
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:56,580
don't have any concrete grasp over ahead

126
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:58,020
of time than it is just hard code these

127
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:00,420
things in our code base so most people

128
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:03,630
just like just thrown under the bus I

129
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:07,560
hate that thing and so that's that's

130
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,390
kind of why we we don't really have a

131
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:14,970
lot of love for in our in our prevailing

132
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:18,300
REST API frameworks and stuff so I did

133
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:21,270
write an API framework that that kind of

134
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:22,890
tries to adhere to the specific

135
00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:26,370
constraint and it's called sorcerer kind

136
00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:27,630
of keeping with the black magic name

137
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:29,490
it's available my github if you want to

138
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:30,990
look at it right now you don't have to

139
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:33,660
you don't ever have to look at it and I

140
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:36,570
also wrote something for robots or for

141
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:39,090
humans that right robots like many of us

142
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:43,800
have done and that's the subservient Lee

143
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,930
named acolyte and that lives also at my

144
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:48,990
github URL and so what do I mean when I

145
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:51,600
say that's for robots or for humans

146
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:54,660
writing robots so like I was saying most

147
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:55,950
people that are running rest api is

148
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:59,220
there they're not going to go to the

149
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:00,360
work and being like well i'm going to

150
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:03,810
implement this state machine and this is

151
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:06,620
like auto-discovery bought in our

152
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:09,960
company's production code base so

153
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,400
there's just hard code those stuff but I

154
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,620
was like you know it would be actually

155
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:17,130
pretty cool if I could just have a very

156
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:21,120
easy way of specifying what kind of what

157
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:25,290
the ballpark fuzzy relationship that I

158
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:27,690
want fleshed out almost declaratively

159
00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:31,820
and then have the library take care of

160
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:35,460
doing all the traversals of resources

161
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:38,010
that come back down the pipe later on so

162
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:39,930
that's kind of what goes on I use

163
00:08:39,930 --> 00:08:41,740
promises a lot

164
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:43,209
just my code in general and definitely

165
00:08:43,209 --> 00:08:45,750
in this and so the general idea is that

166
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:52,600
you you say hey I want dogs you know

167
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,399
let's see if this whatever you whatever

168
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:56,230
posts I'm connected to you let's see if

169
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:58,750
they have something for dogs and if they

170
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:01,209
do then let's see if I can create a new

171
00:09:01,209 --> 00:09:03,730
dog and if I can create a new dog then

172
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:05,890
let's create a new dog and let's go

173
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:07,959
ahead and give that dog and owner and so

174
00:09:07,959 --> 00:09:10,020
you kind of flesh out these

175
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:13,330
relationships or operations that you

176
00:09:13,330 --> 00:09:14,589
want to do against the API and very

177
00:09:14,589 --> 00:09:19,089
broad terms and then the acolyte library

178
00:09:19,089 --> 00:09:21,370
is responsible for talking with the

179
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:23,529
actual API hopefully getting some hey

180
00:09:23,529 --> 00:09:26,680
response compliant stuff back so that it

181
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:28,630
can traverse these relationships and do

182
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:31,240
all that stuff for you and give you back

183
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:35,140
something pretty at the end so you're

184
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:37,589
probably wondering why I have this kooky

185
00:09:37,589 --> 00:09:41,080
antsy art thing going on here I wrote a

186
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:45,610
little example for demonstrating these

187
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:47,560
two libraries and it uses I thought to

188
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:49,959
keep with the node comp theme I would do

189
00:09:49,959 --> 00:09:53,050
some stuff with helicopters and little

190
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:55,300
landing things and automation and I

191
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:57,310
think that would be cool so I'm trying

192
00:09:57,310 --> 00:10:00,180
to pull that up hopefully nothing breaks

193
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:03,610
probably will I was working on it about

194
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:11,180
30 minutes ago let's see where and why

195
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:16,070
somebody from work wants me

196
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:23,640
oh yeah okay so I have this little

197
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:28,860
server here and what it does is it's

198
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:32,250
going to start a bunch of different HTTP

199
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:35,580
processes and all those HTTP processes

200
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:37,590
are running their own little sorcerer

201
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:39,450
instance I mentioned that there's a that

202
00:10:39,450 --> 00:10:41,220
sorcerer API a little library that I

203
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:44,850
wrote and they have information on these

204
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:47,070
landing platforms that I am putting out

205
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:49,650
in this digital can't say digital ocean

206
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:54,000
anymore in this this pixelated ocean

207
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,080
that I made and I'm going to show you

208
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,910
that a minute and basically they each

209
00:10:56,910 --> 00:10:59,310
have their listening on a certain port

210
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:02,580
they each have x and y coordinates and

211
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:04,650
I'm going to try and be able to fly a

212
00:11:04,650 --> 00:11:07,230
little helicopter and ask one of them

213
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:09,720
for permission to land on them without

214
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,580
knowing anything about what their API is

215
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:13,380
shape or the topology of their IP eyes

216
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:15,810
looks like in advance so I'm going to

217
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:20,040
start the server to do that and you see

218
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:24,000
that spawn 10 I think yeah off by one

219
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,250
airs would be the other hard thing in

220
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:27,720
programming so I hope I didn't mess that

221
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:31,530
up attended separate instances in there

222
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:32,880
listening just on the ease of sending

223
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:36,810
ports so now I should hopefully be able

224
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:43,850
to open that up let's end this folder

225
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:49,620
this is all my get up as well and it's

226
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:52,380
just in Patchett / black dash magic dash

227
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:53,820
api's if you want to like have all the

228
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:58,530
talk coves not slides really so let's

229
00:11:58,530 --> 00:12:00,600
see I have this manual demo let's see if

230
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:04,320
this works cool so I have a little note

231
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:08,850
copter here presumably as a jlo go on it

232
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:10,650
that's cool so I'm going to try and use

233
00:12:10,650 --> 00:12:13,290
i'm going to fly this thing this way

234
00:12:13,290 --> 00:12:15,420
conceivably all the landing platforms

235
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:17,250
are that way i'm going to try and fly it

236
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:18,660
that way and then if i see a lady

237
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:20,220
platform i'm going to try and interact

238
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:22,490
with it and get it to let me land on it

239
00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:25,620
so let's see you can't really see it

240
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:27,390
very well but you can see my x and y

241
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:28,120
coordinates up here

242
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,400
she doesn't really look like I'm moving

243
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,890
but you have to just take my word for it

244
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:36,250
that we are fly oh look there's one okay

245
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:38,830
so here's the landing platform let's get

246
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:41,260
a cool right for anybody that's a big

247
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:45,790
video game geek and I am if anybody is a

248
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:49,900
big Atari geek I am this is actually a

249
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:55,650
spreadsheet that I ripped rather rather

250
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:58,720
unofficially from a game called sky

251
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,790
striker for Atari ST it's a flight

252
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:03,250
simulator they have these little things

253
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:05,650
it's actually one of the most fun games

254
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:08,460
ever so if anybody has an Atari ST

255
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:10,420
definitely should go on ebay and try and

256
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:13,839
get a copy of skies drinker anyway so I

257
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:15,700
see this little any platform here that's

258
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:18,970
cool I see kind of its kind of receive

259
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:21,100
it it has what Portland like what

260
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:23,020
localhost and what port it's listening

261
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:25,960
in so it's listening on 3006 that's cool

262
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:28,420
so if I click on it it's actually going

263
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:33,910
to open up the API for that that's

264
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:36,400
another feature of obviously this is not

265
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:40,540
jason another feature of rest that a lot

266
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:42,670
of people tend to neglect is content

267
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:47,860
type negotiation so really you should be

268
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:49,390
able to serve back content in whatever

269
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:52,150
format the the client wants and then

270
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:53,440
there's obviously you're not going to

271
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,330
always be able to do that like I didn't

272
00:13:55,330 --> 00:13:58,270
take the time to write a something to

273
00:13:58,270 --> 00:14:00,940
convert the stacks ml but I did write

274
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:02,680
something to converge a sin to HTML

275
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:05,640
which is what enables me to look at this

276
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:08,920
so that's pretty cool and if that's like

277
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,839
another takeaway that of things that you

278
00:14:10,839 --> 00:14:12,430
should probably do any rest api is this

279
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:15,550
is another thing also version like side

280
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:18,100
note versioning don't put that into our

281
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:22,959
i put it in the accepts like india the

282
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:25,360
content type that you specify it's much

283
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:28,360
easier okay so anyway we see the

284
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,800
representation of the api for the

285
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,600
specific landing platform that's that

286
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,089
guy so we're going to try and see what's

287
00:14:34,089 --> 00:14:35,920
going on with this guy again I don't

288
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,780
have any preconceptions about what ap is

289
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:39,730
this thing exposes

290
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:42,399
um but we can see that make it a little

291
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:44,620
bigger there's looks like there's a way

292
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:47,250
to get the position of this thing

293
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:53,170
negative 3822 rotas worth that's pretty

294
00:14:53,170 --> 00:14:55,329
cool I'll look there's something called

295
00:14:55,329 --> 00:14:58,709
landing requests that sounds topical

296
00:14:58,709 --> 00:15:00,430
requests the land on this particular

297
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:04,420
boat I think I could use that and it

298
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:06,010
shows me what methods i can do so i can

299
00:15:06,010 --> 00:15:08,139
post to it and actually create a landing

300
00:15:08,139 --> 00:15:10,180
requests conceivably so i guess that's

301
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:12,910
what i would do if i were to land it

302
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:15,310
even shows me what parameters that

303
00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:17,860
expects in order for me to to submit to

304
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:19,149
that so that's pretty cool so i think

305
00:15:19,149 --> 00:15:22,600
based on this I know how to interact

306
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,339
with this thing I know how to get to let

307
00:15:24,339 --> 00:15:28,449
me land on it but you know what this is

308
00:15:28,449 --> 00:15:30,010
not really very interesting aircraft

309
00:15:30,010 --> 00:15:31,630
carrier let's keep going and see if we

310
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:33,010
can find a cooler one I hope I don't

311
00:15:33,010 --> 00:15:35,910
though randomly like where they spawn is

312
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:38,529
the randomly assigned so sometimes it's

313
00:15:38,529 --> 00:15:40,750
like okay we didn't have to wait too

314
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:43,139
long oh well we could say it's a

315
00:15:43,139 --> 00:15:48,339
cavalcade here boat party okay let's see

316
00:15:48,339 --> 00:15:50,470
what's going on with this guy oh look

317
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:54,540
this one's got a menu that's awesome

318
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:57,100
I've been flying in this helicopter for

319
00:15:57,100 --> 00:16:00,130
a long time in kind of hungry yeah let's

320
00:16:00,130 --> 00:16:02,699
look at the menu okay so we've got some

321
00:16:02,699 --> 00:16:05,440
lovely JavaScript related foods here

322
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:09,010
Remi salty shims that's that's cool got

323
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:12,579
Cowboys immediately invoked fries I made

324
00:16:12,579 --> 00:16:14,350
all these names last night at like three

325
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:16,600
in the morning so I apologize original

326
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:23,339
at my burger hmm st BLT happy patty melt

327
00:16:23,339 --> 00:16:28,839
the v8 shake is that everything oh well

328
00:16:28,839 --> 00:16:30,370
yeah i think i'm going to get this I

329
00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:32,680
mean it's fast food you know I am in a

330
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:37,180
helicopter so let's see if how out I how

331
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:40,720
would I create an order here ok so

332
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:45,069
there's orders and I can post to it what

333
00:16:45,069 --> 00:16:48,399
does it expect it expects an array rave

334
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:50,019
IDs for the items that won't work ok

335
00:16:50,019 --> 00:16:51,820
let's figure out what I want

336
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:58,590
I want number one wow I'm going to go to

337
00:16:58,590 --> 00:17:04,990
want the BLT for and I'll get the v8

338
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:06,670
shake just because I feel bad for those

339
00:17:06,670 --> 00:17:10,209
guys to 16 that's pretty easy to

340
00:17:10,209 --> 00:17:16,540
remember oh cool so I think I should be

341
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:20,589
able to post two orders right let's see

342
00:17:20,589 --> 00:17:30,420
I'd be my curl food is so bad faking

343
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:39,520
oops one two four six I hope this is

344
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:46,150
right and it was a thousand two thousand

345
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:53,520
four loko host 2004 / orders i right

346
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:57,110
maybe not

347
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:01,020
I stopped my surgery today I don't think

348
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:02,130
said I think it would've given me a

349
00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:12,240
message back maybe I did oh no um anyway

350
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:18,570
let's pretend that worked um okay so

351
00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:20,580
let's try and do something I mean yeah

352
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:21,720
we didn't get food let's try and

353
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:24,450
actually land this sucker so landing

354
00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:28,640
requests looks like it takes a post body

355
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:32,040
and it spikes weight length and time I

356
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,150
don't really know any of those things

357
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:35,670
but i guess i'll just make them up how

358
00:18:35,670 --> 00:18:37,170
long in hours your carefully laying to

359
00:18:37,170 --> 00:18:38,970
hear it's funny when you can't even

360
00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:41,070
really remember that own API like that's

361
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:46,070
maybe that's an argument for he is the

362
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:48,630
fact that i can't remember my own API

363
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:54,870
okay so what I don't know it should just

364
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:57,660
already like automatically assume that

365
00:18:57,660 --> 00:18:59,010
because I didn't I wasn't very smart

366
00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:01,230
about you even though I really you guys

367
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:08,460
about content types after what now I

368
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:09,990
don't think so i think i can get in

369
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:13,050
first it by data like if you if you pre

370
00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:16,400
fix it with data but you might be right

371
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:23,700
dash p I'll try it um okay so anyway

372
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:27,290
we're going to do landing requests right

373
00:19:27,290 --> 00:19:33,360
and oops no that's not right type that

374
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:43,520
we need a weight to whatever lengths to

375
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:49,670
time green beer not very long one day

376
00:19:49,670 --> 00:19:55,050
okay and cool and now we don't want to

377
00:19:55,050 --> 00:19:56,640
post it orders anymore we want to post

378
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:03,490
at any requests oops

379
00:20:03,490 --> 00:20:08,830
and it's a looks like an express area

380
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:16,630
okay I've never seen that error before

381
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:24,850
it's good timing all right one second

382
00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:37,389
all right I'd bury that none sir see I

383
00:20:37,389 --> 00:20:41,059
used to leave it right yeah they're also

384
00:20:41,059 --> 00:20:47,809
really that's weird maybe it's in this

385
00:20:47,809 --> 00:20:55,389
thing

386
00:20:55,399 --> 00:21:05,809
oh yeah okay thank you um that's exactly

387
00:21:05,809 --> 00:21:09,469
what happened ok anyway in the interest

388
00:21:09,469 --> 00:21:11,749
of time let's assume that my landing

389
00:21:11,749 --> 00:21:16,249
request worked and then we can just kind

390
00:21:16,249 --> 00:21:22,190
of like who and yeah so okay so that's

391
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:23,960
doing it manually kind of interacting

392
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,489
with the API manually posts

393
00:21:25,489 --> 00:21:28,549
notwithstanding so I'm going to do next

394
00:21:28,549 --> 00:21:32,029
is close that I'm going to open a

395
00:21:32,029 --> 00:21:33,830
version of the same thing except now i'm

396
00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:35,629
going to have a bot drive it and

397
00:21:35,629 --> 00:21:38,899
hopefully the bot has a better time

398
00:21:38,899 --> 00:21:41,719
actually interacting with with my own

399
00:21:41,719 --> 00:21:45,349
API than I did that's what we write lots

400
00:21:45,349 --> 00:21:50,659
for anyway okay let's try and make sure

401
00:21:50,659 --> 00:21:56,149
that I killed us cool and i'm going to

402
00:21:56,149 --> 00:22:00,649
start the server backup nope okay so

403
00:22:00,649 --> 00:22:02,629
they're all back up and i'm going to

404
00:22:02,629 --> 00:22:06,049
open this alternate version called

405
00:22:06,049 --> 00:22:12,289
automatic and their index 2.html sweet

406
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:14,539
okay so it's kind of looking a little

407
00:22:14,539 --> 00:22:15,619
too fast i don't know if i'm going to be

408
00:22:15,619 --> 00:22:17,179
able to narrate it it's trying to find

409
00:22:17,179 --> 00:22:19,099
information about that thing there and

410
00:22:19,099 --> 00:22:20,539
it says it didn't like it so it's

411
00:22:20,539 --> 00:22:25,249
fetching something else and it's yeah

412
00:22:25,249 --> 00:22:28,609
there goes what's he doing its starting

413
00:22:28,609 --> 00:22:32,389
landing oh look wow so you're gonna have

414
00:22:32,389 --> 00:22:34,129
to take my word for it but it would not

415
00:22:34,129 --> 00:22:35,839
have done that is that post request that

416
00:22:35,839 --> 00:22:37,909
I was unable to make Holly because micro

417
00:22:37,909 --> 00:22:40,759
food is terrible it would not have been

418
00:22:40,759 --> 00:22:43,820
able to land there if the landing

419
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:46,700
platform hadn't said it was okay so yeah

420
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:50,749
so if you want to check it out there's a

421
00:22:50,749 --> 00:22:54,969
very simple declarative way of writing

422
00:22:54,969 --> 00:23:01,660
logic for these BOTS so

423
00:23:01,670 --> 00:23:05,420
in broad strokes I am and this is kind

424
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:06,650
of where it gets into using black magic

425
00:23:06,650 --> 00:23:11,570
api's so we all know hopefully we all

426
00:23:11,570 --> 00:23:13,040
know that there are a bunch of es6

427
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:14,090
features that are coming out and

428
00:23:14,090 --> 00:23:15,440
Dominick's working really hard on that

429
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,570
and that's cool one of the es6 features

430
00:23:17,570 --> 00:23:20,480
that I think should be killed on sight

431
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:23,690
is proxies I think that they're terrible

432
00:23:23,690 --> 00:23:27,350
terrible things I've had many a drunken

433
00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:29,120
argument people where I tell them that I

434
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:31,990
will never like them if they use that

435
00:23:31,990 --> 00:23:40,790
and so i use it for this and and so what

436
00:23:40,790 --> 00:23:43,820
it does is I yeah so I'm a sucker for

437
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:48,320
declared simple you know silly

438
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,870
programming of the simplest kind so I

439
00:23:50,870 --> 00:23:54,050
like to be able to do things like few

440
00:23:54,050 --> 00:23:57,800
Bart bass and obviously this is no way

441
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:59,750
to interact with an asynchronous API

442
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:03,400
somewhere you're running something

443
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:06,230
because these are just property accesses

444
00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:07,640
they all happen synchronously there's no

445
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:11,870
way to do that aha except if you're

446
00:24:11,870 --> 00:24:13,550
doing something where you're defining a

447
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:16,250
getter that returns functions

448
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:18,440
transparently for these things so let's

449
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:21,710
say that instead of foo bar baz let's

450
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:29,930
say that I had my my acolyte library and

451
00:24:29,930 --> 00:24:37,280
then I talked to listening to your to

452
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:40,460
connect to you 20 50 whatever and then I

453
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:43,730
can do things like it's like a light

454
00:24:43,730 --> 00:24:46,640
let's say that we have some collection

455
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,890
dogs that we just assume is there then

456
00:24:48,890 --> 00:24:55,840
we want find dog with ID too baby and

457
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:58,880
maybe we assume that that dog has an

458
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:04,360
owner and then we can do owner dot I

459
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:07,040
don't know University maybe they

460
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:09,389
graduated

461
00:25:09,389 --> 00:25:12,629
and then at the end of it when we're

462
00:25:12,629 --> 00:25:14,639
done doing terrible terrible things to

463
00:25:14,639 --> 00:25:17,849
javascript we rely on the fact that all

464
00:25:17,849 --> 00:25:19,409
these things are kind of transparent

465
00:25:19,409 --> 00:25:21,570
functor transparent promises so they all

466
00:25:21,570 --> 00:25:23,129
have been properties and I could attach

467
00:25:23,129 --> 00:25:27,059
a bin bin at any point in this chain and

468
00:25:27,059 --> 00:25:29,940
get that result out for that step and

469
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:35,969
then I can and that would conceivably

470
00:25:35,969 --> 00:25:38,879
give me the information about that the

471
00:25:38,879 --> 00:25:43,489
dog number two's owners University and

472
00:25:43,489 --> 00:25:47,249
yeah and so like I said it uses object

473
00:25:47,249 --> 00:25:52,629
onto fine I'm sorry it uses proxies to

474
00:25:52,639 --> 00:25:56,909
set up a like a get trap on properties

475
00:25:56,909 --> 00:25:59,249
for each of these objects and succession

476
00:25:59,249 --> 00:26:02,570
so it says okay somebody requested dogs

477
00:26:02,570 --> 00:26:05,039
they tried to read this property dogs I

478
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:07,950
don't have it but instead of throwing a

479
00:26:07,950 --> 00:26:09,919
read error or something I'm going to

480
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:12,989
give them this promisee type thing back

481
00:26:12,989 --> 00:26:17,279
that is it's it's itself a proxy and in

482
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:18,509
the background i'm going to try and make

483
00:26:18,509 --> 00:26:22,049
this API request or a resource at that

484
00:26:22,049 --> 00:26:24,239
matches dogs and I'll first I'll fetch

485
00:26:24,239 --> 00:26:26,969
the just the route link and then i'll

486
00:26:26,969 --> 00:26:28,559
look if there's anything related to dogs

487
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:31,559
and then I'll give them that it back if

488
00:26:31,559 --> 00:26:34,320
I can find it and so kind does that it

489
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:35,989
drills down through the list of stuff

490
00:26:35,989 --> 00:26:40,499
and yeah and so that's I'm kind of

491
00:26:40,499 --> 00:26:42,450
rushing for time but that's what i did

492
00:26:42,450 --> 00:26:43,859
in broad strokes if you're more

493
00:26:43,859 --> 00:26:45,499
interested in this kind of stuff then

494
00:26:45,499 --> 00:26:47,969
you should be then come talk to me about

495
00:26:47,969 --> 00:26:51,659
it yeah I think that's about all the

496
00:26:51,659 --> 00:26:54,599
time I have maybe like one minute left

497
00:26:54,599 --> 00:26:56,489
maybe night neither that but if anybody

498
00:26:56,489 --> 00:27:00,610
has any questions you know
