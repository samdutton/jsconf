already it is the sixth time you're

6
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:26,849
doing this it is likely gonna be the

7
00:00:26,849 --> 00:00:29,220
biggest we might have just a few more

8
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:32,520
people than we had in 2016 I'm sorry I

9
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:36,329
was a bit late this time over issues and

10
00:00:36,329 --> 00:00:39,329
reasons and we're in January now which I

11
00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:42,149
hope you'll still gonna appreciate James

12
00:00:42,149 --> 00:00:44,309
Camtasia like every J s conf is a

13
00:00:44,309 --> 00:00:46,640
community event it is for you

14
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,070
specifically for the attendees and we

15
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:52,649
want to make sure that in this event in

16
00:00:52,649 --> 00:00:55,829
these three days you get ample chance to

17
00:00:55,829 --> 00:00:57,960
get to know each other as well and not

18
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:01,760
only learn we did this survey online

19
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,199
with everybody who checked in and thank

20
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:05,460
you for answering all these slightly

21
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:08,850
funny questions and we asked what is

22
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:11,310
RJ's comes the best place for to do and

23
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:14,070
you answered with the vast majority a

24
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:18,090
great place to meet people so like you

25
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:19,680
can give yourself a big round of

26
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,750
applause just for that I think that's

27
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:23,670
actually a good reason to do a

28
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:26,159
conference so please let's get this

29
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:30,150
warmed up in general this applause stuff

30
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:32,549
you need to really get get going over

31
00:01:32,549 --> 00:01:33,689
the day we're gonna have some fantastic

32
00:01:33,689 --> 00:01:38,130
speakers today 24 in total and then plus

33
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:39,869
a bunch of workshop hosts they bring

34
00:01:39,869 --> 00:01:42,630
their TAS teaching assistants tomorrow

35
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:43,890
too so they're gonna be a lot of people

36
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:46,770
tomorrow at the shangri-la and this is

37
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:48,240
the major change we have this year

38
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,210
compared to the last time we have three

39
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:53,130
days the middle day is our community and

40
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:55,320
workshop day the biggest feedback that I

41
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:58,680
got in 2016 was that the conference was

42
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:01,820
great but it was really three days of

43
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:05,430
listening to people and that's not very

44
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:07,350
interactive is it so that's why we

45
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:09,200
created this workshop day it's an expert

46
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,750
if you will one that's sold out quicker

47
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:14,450
than we thought so it's gonna be rather

48
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:16,280
packed tomorrow be sure you go there

49
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:19,010
early and it's not gonna be the

50
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:20,870
shangri-la in the city it's gonna be the

51
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:23,180
one on sentosa just to make that clear

52
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:26,569
for everybody also for us you already

53
00:02:26,569 --> 00:02:29,739
went to the wrong one yesterday so

54
00:02:29,739 --> 00:02:33,800
getting to know yourself is the part of

55
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:36,440
my opening that I want to cover and I

56
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:39,200

128
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:11,569
I had to code something up again so here

129
00:06:11,569 --> 00:06:12,589

00:06:12,589 --> 00:06:27,159

check-in like a lot of questions and

170
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:58,550
about 300 of you responded and I sifted

171
00:08:58,550 --> 00:09:00,050
through all of them and I got the top

172
00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:02,300
answers to these so we started with

173
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:03,980
level 1 which we have here and we are

174
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:06,230
looking for the top 7 answers your job

175
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:08,839
is now to find one of them whoever hits

176
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:11,510
the button faster and get the question

177
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:14,270
up we're gonna play with your team right

178
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:15,830
it should the answer be wrong we're

179
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:17,360
gonna sift it over to the other team and

180
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,209
he gets the chance to steal it

181
00:09:19,209 --> 00:09:21,920
should he be wrong again you get another

182
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:22,670
chance

183
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:24,980
if you then don't get it the level has

184
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:29,120
gone to nowhere okay go for it back we

185
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,610
play with the team afterwards so you

186
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:33,260
have to find one of the seven top

187
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:37,279
answers - we asked a hundred people what

188
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:54,940
is my worst habit while coding unicorn

189
00:09:54,950 --> 00:09:58,070
in context switching context switching

190
00:09:58,070 --> 00:10:00,480
let's see if context switching is one of

191
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:05,310
the answers and now it is not that means

192
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:12,810
we'll get to you watching YouTube and I

193
00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:16,350
let's put it in the context of something

194
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:18,450
else which I think we might have and

195
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:22,850
that is actually the top answer

196
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:25,770
procrastinating with 18% of you that

197
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:27,860
means we gonna play with Team Unicorn

198
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:30,450
you may go back to the table and then

199
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:32,820
we're gonna continue with Jo you can now

200
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:34,560
take a guess on what you think is gonna

201
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,060
be on the board please use the

202
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:41,040
microphone can you repeat the question

203
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:44,730
again we asked a hundred people what is

204
00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:47,100
your worst coding habit worst habit

205
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:52,770
while coding not commenting my code not

206
00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:55,110
commenting my codes let's see if that's

207
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:58,320
on the board that's correct

208
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:04,500
nice Karis wrong inventing wrong

209
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:10,020
indenting let's see if that's part no

210
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:13,650
it's not so now we go back all the way

211
00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:14,460
to the front

212
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:16,770
we started with Wilson again you have

213
00:11:16,770 --> 00:11:18,720
three access that you can earn and then

214
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,340
we're gonna go over and they can steal

215
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:31,380
oh no it's just you it's just you

216
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:35,840
my worst habit while coding think of

217
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:38,960
yourself don't write this not writing

218
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:44,090
test is that one of the answers yes not

219
00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:55,780
testing 8% why not I'm gonna say not

220
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:59,390
using good coding standards not using

221
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:03,050
good coding standards see if that's on

222
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:11,210
the board not on the board not cleaning

223
00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:12,590
up all the mess you made

224
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:14,990
sagen not cleaning up all the mess you

225
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:17,360
may not like properly refactoring after

226
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:26,079
you not properly filling around

227
00:12:26,089 --> 00:12:29,820
unicorn here can actually steal so you

228
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:32,160
may actually join here and discuss with

229
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:36,779
your teammates if you are able to find

230
00:12:36,779 --> 00:12:38,940
one answer on the board you can see all

231
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:47,399
the points okay this is the difference

232
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:48,420
in game shows you typically have

233
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:49,920
background music in these situations

234
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:58,730
right

235
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:02,230
all right do you have an answer so we

236
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:04,510
say leaving technical debt leaving

237
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:12,520
technical debt just admitted people I'm

238
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:15,790
sorry this round will therefore go to

239
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:20,380
wait you were team kitty cat those

240
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:23,920
points great other answers on the boards

241
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,500
were with number two and the audience

242
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:33,450
may repeat over optimizing number three

243
00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:39,720
over thinking number five copy pasting

244
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:46,630
number seven perfecting overdoing it all

245
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:48,520
right now you get how the game works so

246
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:50,740
I can now get the second player of every

247
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:52,180
team to come over for the next question

248
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:56,780
please

249
00:13:56,790 --> 00:14:01,110
so Martin versus toe

250
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:04,450
yes team kittycat Team Unicorn everybody

251
00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:04,900
okay

252
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:09,310
we asked 100 people about my last coding

253
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:13,540
project had too many or too much this

254
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:22,000
team kitty cat you were first at too

255
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,010
many errors let's see if that's one of

256
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:28,200
the questions too many bugs they go

257
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,190
fantastic they're gonna play with your

258
00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:33,210
team team kitty cat

259
00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:35,500
the next person of team cat head can

260
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:41,140
then choose an answer too much code too

261
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:44,830
much code sound stupid but turns out to

262
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:58,450
be right very good next one

263
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:00,960
you can shout into let's make this more

264
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,400
entertaining if you have an idea just

265
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:13,200
shout it in there is no demo demo how to

266
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:13,890
use it

267
00:15:13,890 --> 00:15:16,650
my last coding project had too many

268
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:35,760
demos just checking to complex alright

269
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,650
let's see that's an answer my last

270
00:15:37,650 --> 00:15:40,710
coding project had too much complexity

271
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:42,590
talk answer fantastic

272
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:51,930

00:15:51,930 --> 00:15:55,500
libraries whoo let's see how that turns

274
00:15:55,500 --> 00:16:00,330
out too many dependencies that's pretty

275
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:15,039
good keep it going keep it going

276
00:16:15,049 --> 00:16:17,579

00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:45,239
programmers sadly not it was on the list

280
00:16:45,239 --> 00:17:02,560

sure I can show you so we had on number

287
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:46,650
one we had complexity number 2 code

number 3 bucks we had number 4 legacy

289
00:17:49,559 --> 00:17:55,460
let's see answer 5 and duplicate code

290
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:57,600
I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry

291
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:01,620

let's see if that's actually a thing all

299
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:38,160

300
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,690

see that's why I was I thought you were

308
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:09,530
asking when the five seconds are when

309
00:19:09,530 --> 00:19:11,120
the deadline is approaching the pan

310
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:15,560
let's see if that's one of the answers I

311
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:17,330
remember it was on the list but it is

312
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:29,710
not in the top five nobody's watching

313
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:32,620
nobody is watching

314
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:44,870
let's see nobody is watching pair

315
00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:45,530
programming

316
00:19:45,530 --> 00:19:53,620
when pair programming with great people

317
00:19:53,620 --> 00:20:00,770
that counts I think it's Martin's

318
00:20:00,770 --> 00:20:07,200
tonight

319
00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:10,090
working on a new project working on a

320
00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:15,790
new project working on a new project

321
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:17,100

answers and your answer is after I get a

329
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:56,170
promotion or a raise after promotion or

330
00:20:56,170 --> 00:21:02,560
a raise like that means all those points

alright we asked 100 people you ready

343
00:21:56,809 --> 00:21:59,639
the worst thing about being a developer

344
00:21:59,639 --> 00:22:05,159
is you need to have an answer when you

345
00:22:05,159 --> 00:22:23,639
press s surprise worst thing about being

346
00:22:23,639 --> 00:22:30,210
a web developer chance to steal the

347
00:22:30,210 --> 00:22:31,769
audience can help it's all your answers

you know the answers if you the worst

349
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:46,930
thing about being a buffalo face testing

let's see what people actually chose

355
00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:05,690
from the list you may go back to your

356
00:23:05,690 --> 00:23:09,320
table we start on the bottom to make it

357
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:13,100
more exciting number five it's a lot of

358
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:18,860
responsibility number four no gender

359
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:28,210
diversity all your answers number three

360
00:23:28,210 --> 00:23:35,470
it's unrelatable for others number two

361
00:23:35,470 --> 00:23:44,840
it's high workload and number one

362
00:23:44,850 --> 00:23:48,450
[Applause]

363
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:50,930
question five the second player of each

364
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:59,210
team please Allah we asked a hundred

365
00:23:59,210 --> 00:24:01,550
people the first thing that comes to

366
00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:05,320
mind when hearing the word JavaScript is

question in this whole check-in process

you may click this box now if you'd like

434
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:17,020
clicking boxes so it's a guessing game

435
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:18,850
how many percent of the audience do you

436
00:29:18,850 --> 00:29:26,980
think like clicking check boxes eighty

437
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:30,190
eighty six percent okay great a hundred

438
00:29:30,190 --> 00:29:33,970
percent it's unlikely but okay fifty

439
00:29:33,970 --> 00:29:39,040
percent okay so let's see who is closest

440
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:47,110
and I will be marching with 17 that's

441
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:49,240

registration desk and we're gonna sort

468
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:09,240
this out because you're currently having

469
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:11,860
two seeds and we would like to give one

470
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:13,600
of those to other people that have none

471
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,640
