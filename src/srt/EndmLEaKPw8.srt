1
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:14,980
I never expected having a child to change
my identity in so many different ways.

2
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:16,960
You see, I love working.

3
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:22,830
I really love working, and I love being a
developer, I love being an engineering manager.

4
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:26,420
I love solving hard problems every day.

5
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:28,900
And I've always worn a lot of hats.

6
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:34,480
I work at GitHub as the engineering manager
as well for another team that is working on

7
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:39,800
a secret product, re-imagining fun and collaboration
in code.

8
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:46,130
I'm also a Mozilla tech speaker, on the word
of Ruby Together, and I run a podcast about

9
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:48,180
parent-driven development.

10
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:50,799
I have stickers for all of these things.

11
00:00:50,799 --> 00:00:54,470
If you want to chat about any of them, please
come and find me.

12
00:00:54,470 --> 00:01:00,410
I've been a community organiser, a mentor,
a developer, an organiser, a COO, and then,

13
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:04,970
all of a sudden, I was a mom.

14
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:06,720
So this is Devon.

15
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,330
He was important in April 2015.

16
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:14,940
This talk is going to have a lot of pictures
of him.

17
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:21,479
Devon's a full-blown toddler now and joined
by his sister, Layla who is just over a year.

18
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:27,470
Today, I want to talk about the challenges
people who are parents and developers face,

19
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:33,890
as well as what some solutions are, and how
these solutions can help a company and an

20
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:35,770
entire team.

21
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:44,450
So, when Devon was about five months old,
I felt like I was losing my mind.

22
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:48,740
I had been back at work full-time for a while
- if you want to hear a separate rant, talk

23
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:55,030
to me about maternity leave in the States
- and after a particularly bad week of very

24
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:59,950
little sleep at night, and having a really
challenging workweek, I just really wasn't

25
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:01,609
sure if I could do it.

26
00:02:01,609 --> 00:02:06,750
How was I going to keep learning all the things
I needed to be learning while being a great

27
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:10,610
mom, employee, and adequate partner?

28
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:13,460
How did did others do it?

29
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:14,900
Was I being unrealistic?

30
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:15,900
Was I being lazy.

31
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:23,480
Could I even be a good mom and a developer
or was this industry just truly not for me?

32
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:30,770
If I've being really honest, there's been
many times in the past four years where even

33
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:36,599
though I loved tech and I loved code, I thought
about how nice it would be just to go and

34
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:40,709
do a job that I could do on autopilot.

35
00:02:40,709 --> 00:02:43,150
I seriously thought about leaving the industry.

36
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:49,260
You see these cute pictures of parents orchids
on Facebook or Instagram, but it's not always

37
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:54,300
like that, and, for me, in the early days,
it definitely usually wasn't like that.

38
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:57,880
It has hard, tiring, frustrating.

39
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:01,810
It was also amazing, and all-encompassing.

40
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:07,939
It was really, really lonely.

41
00:03:07,939 --> 00:03:12,829
Based on what I was experiencing, I created
a survey to ask parents a few questions about

42
00:03:12,829 --> 00:03:17,940
this issue, and what I found out from reading
hundreds of surveys, is there are some real

43
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:20,370
trends and common issues.

44
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:29,020
In an industry, the values - in a industry
that voles open-source contributions, parents

45
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:31,799
are struggling.

46
00:03:31,799 --> 00:03:36,930
So let me take a second to describe a typical
day from a few months ago.

47
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:42,709
So Devon wakes up around seven, Layla already
around 730.

48
00:03:42,709 --> 00:03:46,409
A lot of parents say it's closer to 5.30 or
six.

49
00:03:46,409 --> 00:03:55,150
I would nurse Layla while Devon has a glass
of milk and by 8.15, we really need to get

50
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:59,209
moving, brush teeth, make car breakfasts - you
can feel free to judge.

51
00:03:59,209 --> 00:04:04,920
We're not morning people, car breakfast is
what works very well for us.

52
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:10,260
And at 8.45 or nanny comes which is already
a huge privilege.

53
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:12,390
By nine I drop Devon off at preschool.

54
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:20,390
By 9.25 I was home pumping breast milk while
eat breakfast and starting to check emails.

55
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:26,490
I would jump into the work day, do that punctuated
by a few more breast-milk pumping breaks until

56
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:28,710
about 5.15.

57
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:39,470
Then I race out the door, grab Layla, put
her in the car, from 6.15 to 7.15, we do dinner

58
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:45,470
for the kids, sometimes try to cook our dinner,
Bath time, bed tile, et cetera.

59
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:51,520
From .45 until around nine, we finish cooking,
we eat dinner, clean up, prep food in bottles

60
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:57,950
for the next day, jot down childcare notes,
talk about pertinent household stuff we need

61
00:04:57,950 --> 00:05:04,280
to, usually relax for like 30 minutes, and
then we head to bed.

62
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:07,660
We have it pretty good, even with two.

63
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:12,000
Now, fortunately, this was a day from a couple
of months ago.

64
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,220
I got a lot more time back in my day as I
weaned my daughter and didn't need to pump

65
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:18,320
breast milk.

66
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:23,670
Dropping the number of times that I had to
pump in a day felt amazing.

67
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:28,800
I had more time to concentrate and didn't
have to go through this huge context-switch

68
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,320
every two hours.

69
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:36,460
And I mention this tangent because pumping
breast milk was mentioned in over half of

70
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:42,370
surveys for mothers and their answer is about
company provision or issues they faced.

71
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:48,830
Now, the only time in that whole day that
I would have to do any code for myself would

72
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:54,620
be those last 30 minutes that I have to relax,
and even if I gave up that little bit of self-care

73
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:59,790
time, my brain is so tired by then, I wouldn't
get anywhere fast.

74
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:06,080
And if you think about this in terms of code
challenges that often need to be completed

75
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:11,590
outside of your work day for new jobs, parents
may have to spend the whole weekend just working

76
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:13,030
on a couple of code challenges.

77
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:17,900
It also means depending on our partner or
spouse to do the childcare and not seeing

78
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:19,430
your kids.

79
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:23,680
This might not seem like a big deal, but when
you're already working full-time, it really

80
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,680
is.

81
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:27,340
This is even more challenging if you're a
single parent.

82
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:31,460
If you're a accessible parent, then you're
likely paying for weekend childcare to get

83
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:35,330
these code challenges done.

84
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:38,860
Another issue mentioned was being able to
stay sharp.

85
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:42,870
Developers live on coffee and solve really
hard problems.

86
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:47,860
If you are a nursing mom, you're probably
getting significantly less sleep, and you

87
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:51,500
can't rely on those cups of coffee to keep
you going.

88
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:58,740
A recent study from baby care found that over
40 per cent of parents with babies aged zero

89
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:05,720
to six months only get one to three uninterrupted
hours of sleep per night.

90
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:12,400
Parents lose a total of 44 days of sleep in
their child's first year, and a newer study

91
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:17,650
found that parents are sleep-deprived for
six years after they have a kid, and I'm like

92
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:22,460
really selling this parenting thing right
now!

93
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:26,840
It's hard to keep a clear mind and solve hard
problems when you're not getting uninterrupted

94
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:31,550
sleep, and you don't get the weekend to catch
up or recharge.

95
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:35,610
A parent wrote, "Sometimes, the last thing
I want to do or even have time to do when

96
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:38,840
I get home is code or learn new code.

97
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:43,240
Gone are the days of no responsibility and
doing whatever I like when I get home.

98
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:48,660
Finding a couple of hours to work on a personal
project or pick up something new is hard,

99
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:54,840
especially when trying to help out my other
half who is also tired."

100
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:59,610
When I asked if having children helped or
hurt their career, only a small portion of

101
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:01,470
fathers said it hurt their career.

102
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:05,610
They felt it either helped or had a future
impact.

103
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:10,730
About 60 per cent of women said that having
children hurt their career, but even more

104
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:15,740
than that, said it didn't hurt their career,
but it changed it.

105
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:20,830
Many women said it slowed their career, affecting
the overall trajectory and growth potential.

106
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:26,800
Now, I don't know about you, but that description
certainly sounds like hurt ing mothers clearest

107
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,770
to me.

108
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:32,669
So here's the total breakdown of parents based
on if they felt that having a child helped,

109
00:08:32,669 --> 00:08:36,089
hurt, or had no impact, or helped and hurt
their career.

110
00:08:36,089 --> 00:08:41,300
Here are those same traces based on mom answers
and bad answers.

111
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:45,980
As you can see, when everyone is together,
the portions are equal.

112
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:49,699
As you break it down, it tells a much different
story.

113
00:08:49,699 --> 00:08:53,850
This data is backed up by additional research.

114
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:59,079
This 2018 study on children and gender and
equality in Denmark shows these results based

115
00:08:59,079 --> 00:09:04,209
on gender and earnings in Denmark, which I
know at least for most Americans consider

116
00:09:04,209 --> 00:09:09,899
closer to the gold standard in terms of supporting
parents.

117
00:09:09,899 --> 00:09:14,860
So while there are lots of challenges that
parents face, there are also lots of solutions.

118
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:19,060
Looking at these surveys, they're identifiable
solutions that companies can put in place,

119
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:23,180
solutions that colleagues with or without
children can employ, and things that parents

120
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:25,000
out there can also work on.

121
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,360
These solutions can actually benefit an entire
team.

122
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:35,000
The company- based ones: allow working from
home or unconventional working options.

123
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,120
Even when a parent is ready to come back to
work, offering different options can make

124
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,060
huge difference in their happiness level.

125
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:46,769
For women who are pumping, being able to work
from home makes an enormous difference.

126
00:09:46,769 --> 00:09:51,670
When I worked from home, I could pump in 22
minutes because I had everything set up, and

127
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:56,529
ready to go, but any time that I went into
an office, it took me 32 to 34 minutes each

128
00:09:56,529 --> 00:10:01,040
time, because I had to set up, clean up, and
the travel time to get to the room, hope nobody's

129
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,730
in the room, et cetera.

130
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:08,089
Hopefully, this isn't as much of an issue
in Europe or outside of the States but I wanted

131
00:10:08,089 --> 00:10:12,499
to mention it again, because over half of
surveys from women suggested that issues are

132
00:10:12,499 --> 00:10:17,100
difficulties around pumping pup if you have
women at your company that are pumping in

133
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:22,339
their bathroom, your company needs to seriously
consider how they prioritise mothers in the

134
00:10:22,339 --> 00:10:25,519
workforce.

135
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:29,680
Allowing working from home takes the stress
of a commute out of the equation, and allows

136
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:34,379
parents a little more flexibility and time
in their day.

137
00:10:34,379 --> 00:10:39,029
Another option is to offer a part-time transition
back to work, so surveys show that people

138
00:10:39,029 --> 00:10:43,190
took this in different ways, some working
less hours, some working less days, but a

139
00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:47,860
gradual transition back to work for pretty
much as long as the company can allow it makes

140
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:50,670
an enormous difference in a parent's lifestyle.

141
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:56,860
Second, companies can take a much more proactive
role in creating support systems.

142
00:10:56,860 --> 00:11:01,670
So a really simple example of this might be
a parenting Slack channel where parents can

143
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:04,600
share experiences, issues, and pictures of
their kids.

144
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:10,120
And a more involved option might be to connect
parents returning to work with those who have

145
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:14,490
taken parental leave in the past and allow
for it to be a safe space pour both parties

146
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:20,110
to discuss - for both parties to discuss successes,
issues, and challenges.

147
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:25,649
Finally, train managers on what to expect
when someone on parental leave comes back

148
00:11:25,649 --> 00:11:26,850
to work.

149
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:29,180
This is important for moms do dads but moms?

150
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:30,519
In particular.

151
00:11:30,519 --> 00:11:34,910
Oftentimes, managers in tech may never have
had a mother go on maternity leave for their

152
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:36,139
team.

153
00:11:36,139 --> 00:11:41,810
They have no idea what challenges she is facing,
what questions might help or hurt her return

154
00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:47,339
back to work transition, and how best to support
her.

155
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:54,279
Over and over again, I felt my boss was a
big part of my success when I was a new parent.

156
00:11:54,279 --> 00:11:58,070
Third, create realistic expectations returning
to work.

157
00:11:58,070 --> 00:12:04,559
If your company operates out of KPIs, or goal-setting,
recognise these should be revisited when parents

158
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:07,290
come back to work, and set new goals.

159
00:12:07,290 --> 00:12:11,819
These will likely not be as ambitious as they
did in the past.

160
00:12:11,819 --> 00:12:16,959
If you're a manager, encourage realistic goal-setting,
and, if you're an employee, recognise that

161
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:18,449
your whole life has changed.

162
00:12:18,449 --> 00:12:22,449
Give yourself a least a quarter or two to
adjust to the new normal.

163
00:12:22,449 --> 00:12:27,079
As your children get older, you will become
what effective goal-setting and realistic

164
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:30,880
expectations look like for you.

165
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:34,449
Fourth, if you have children or if you don't
have children or for the majority of your

166
00:12:34,449 --> 00:12:37,339
team is childless, don't make parent stuff
weird.

167
00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:40,430
Talk about nursing, kid things, in whatever
ways feel comfortable.

168
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:46,430
One of the things that I did when I was back
in the office after my first was create an

169
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:49,380
emoji for when I was away from my computer
pumping.

170
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:54,339
This helped me feel open and honest about
what was going on, and it did so in a way

171
00:12:54,339 --> 00:12:57,319
that didn't make my team feel awkward or weird
about it.

172
00:12:57,319 --> 00:13:01,600
After my second, I just stuck my pumping times
right on my calendar so folks didn't schedule

173
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,720
meetings over them.

174
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:08,920
My previous company, I did a lightning talk
for the engineering team.

175
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:12,519
I did two while I was pregnant, about what
that was like, and one afterwards about the

176
00:13:12,519 --> 00:13:14,749
science of breast milk and pumping.

177
00:13:14,749 --> 00:13:19,879
My team asked interesting questions and had
much more empathy and understanding for me

178
00:13:19,879 --> 00:13:25,649
afterwards, and my hope is by exposing them
to some of the terminology and experiences

179
00:13:25,649 --> 00:13:29,710
that there will be more understanding and
empathic to women or parents they might work

180
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:31,559
with in the future.

181
00:13:31,559 --> 00:13:38,170
But, this should not be incumbent on the pregnant
individual to do so.

182
00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:42,660
Managers should have an understanding of these
facts, and also be willing to be the one that

183
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:47,500
helps their team understand these considerations.

184
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:53,579
That's realistic expectations and normalising
it.

185
00:13:53,579 --> 00:13:59,920
When creative options, realistic expectations,
support systems, and normalisation of someone's

186
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:04,670
life choices are incorporated into a team
or company's culture, it is positive, it has

187
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:08,149
positive benefits for the entire company.

188
00:14:08,149 --> 00:14:13,420
The open acceptance of diversity and intentional
support around the uniqueness of a team-mate's

189
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:17,189
life creates that sort of in a team.

190
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:22,999
As they are trained to establish and seek
out things like support systems, or create

191
00:14:22,999 --> 00:14:28,369
realistic expectations, anyone going through
any sort of hardship or life adjustment will

192
00:14:28,369 --> 00:14:30,319
feel supported.

193
00:14:30,319 --> 00:14:35,220
Once you've created these systems and benefits,
it's easier to see how similar accommodations

194
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:39,190
for others enable teams to thrive.

195
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:43,730
Support systems could help folks from burning
out, and normalise being open about struggles

196
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:49,709
and successes makes it more likely that someone
who is burning out will speak up earlier.

197
00:14:49,709 --> 00:14:55,269
Realistic expectations encourage teams to
craft better guidelines around work and promotion

198
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:59,250
which often help under-represented minorities
succeed.

199
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:03,569
And creative working options help companies
attract the best talent regardless of where

200
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:04,809
they reside.

201
00:15:04,809 --> 00:15:08,000
There are also things that we can do as parents.

202
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:13,209
First, get rid of your parent guilt, which
is so much easier said than done.

203
00:15:13,209 --> 00:15:15,839
So I'm going to tell you a story about Hallowe'en.

204
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:21,449
My son was a baby, six months old, I made
two Hallowe'en costumes for him, and there's

205
00:15:21,449 --> 00:15:24,970
been so many home-made does actuals since
then.

206
00:15:24,970 --> 00:15:31,190
The picture of both my children, those are
the costumes I frantically finished sewing

207
00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:34,890
eight yours before I had to fly to Malaysia.

208
00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:36,290
Why?

209
00:15:36,290 --> 00:15:42,361
Because, for me, I feel spending this time
after the kids have gone to bed, making their

210
00:15:42,361 --> 00:15:47,490
costumes, of course, that's the reason why
my kids feel like they're my top priority,

211
00:15:47,490 --> 00:15:48,670
right?

212
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:51,010
No, that's ridiculous statement.

213
00:15:51,010 --> 00:15:55,689
I know it's a ridiculous statement, it's a
ridiculous statement to say, but oftentimes

214
00:15:55,689 --> 00:15:57,180
working parents feel this way.

215
00:15:57,180 --> 00:16:02,230
We feel bad and like we are ordering too much
take-out, or we miss a special activity, but

216
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:07,880
we also need to realise that working and doing
something that we love is just as important

217
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:10,079
for us and for our children to see.

218
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:16,259
A mom said, "I thought I was a bad mother
and developer because I didn't make everything

219
00:16:16,259 --> 00:16:19,949
perfect."

220
00:16:19,949 --> 00:16:26,879
Next schedule, it took me about a year to
do this, but the first time I took a random

221
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:31,459
day off, where my son was in childcare, my
husband was at work, and I didn't pack my

222
00:16:31,459 --> 00:16:35,309
day filled with catch-up work or household
chores.

223
00:16:35,309 --> 00:16:37,420
I felt so refreshed.

224
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:43,379
We don't get the weekends to recharge, and
vacations are really not vacations once you

225
00:16:43,379 --> 00:16:44,699
have had a child.

226
00:16:44,699 --> 00:16:48,480
So it's important to not put these days off,
and to make sure that you're taking at least

227
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,819
one every couple of months just to recharge.

228
00:16:51,819 --> 00:16:54,579
Next, optimise the time that you have available.

229
00:16:54,579 --> 00:17:00,370
So as I mentioned before, a lot of surveys
talk about being really aware of the finite

230
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:04,620
amount of time that parents had do work, so
make sure that you're making the most of these

231
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:05,620
hours.

232
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:09,990
Set learning goals, focus and figure out how
to hack your day to create as much time as

233
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:14,240
possible to add advance whatever goals you're
putting forward for yourself.

234
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:20,040
Next, we can only make this better if we are
united.

235
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:27,170
So, it wasn't until I truly felt like I was
teeth ing under the stress that I reached

236
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:30,040
out to other mum developers.

237
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:35,340
It wasn't until I reached out that I learned
that lots of people felt the same way that

238
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:36,340
I did.

239
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:41,470
I found some excellent communities of moms
in tech, and it's made a huge difference.

240
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:45,820
Being able to speak with one another, and
share challenges, solutions, and suggestions,

241
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:46,820
is invaluable.

242
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:51,150
Just lying having a support group, when you
have a newborn supporting one another as parents

243
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:57,170
in tech makes us stronger, and better, and
gives us a more united voice.

244
00:17:57,170 --> 00:18:01,710
Next: share that mental load.

245
00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:06,030
So I'm going to talk about moms for a moment,
because mothers are disproportionately affected

246
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:10,270
by the weight of mental load, although this
happens in most partnerships.

247
00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:16,610
In 2015, the Pugh Research Centre interviewed
1,800 parents in households where they both

248
00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:17,610
work.

249
00:18:17,610 --> 00:18:23,430
They asked who does the work of managing your
children's schedules and activities?

250
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:27,910
Who takes care of the kids when they're sick?

251
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:37,010
Marie Kondo's series was a prime example of
women being crushed by responsibilities.

252
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:43,950
The number of moms who I talked to who told
me they sat on the couch and cried while watching

253
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:49,090
that show because they felt the same way was
truly incredible.

254
00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:53,360
The New York Times had an article in February
about working mothers in Japan, and it spoke

255
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:59,030
about how working mothers often work more
than 49 hours a week and typically do close

256
00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:06,840
to 25 hours of housework a week, while their
partners do an average of less than five.

257
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:10,490
So let's say you have a partner, and let's
say your partner's great which which I have

258
00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:15,520
found is a big assumption, and let's say that
you feel like you've got a good split of work.

259
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:21,360
You share pick-ups and drop offs, you share
cooking, cleaning, et cetera.

260
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,150
But what about the other stuff?

261
00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:26,880
So, who thinks about what the kids are going
to eat for lunch?

262
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,990
Who schedules doctor's appointments?

263
00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:31,700
Who knows what day school will be loafed?

264
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:36,820
Who knows what child needs next developmentally
and what is coming after that?

265
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:40,760
Who buys the birthday presents?

266
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:42,670
Who reviews homework?

267
00:19:42,670 --> 00:19:48,330
Who plans and packs for family trips?

268
00:19:48,330 --> 00:19:52,460
If you're already splitting this load, then
I applaud you, but for many families, this

269
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:55,820
isn't the case, so if you're not doing it
already, share that load.

270
00:19:55,820 --> 00:20:01,590
I will rink to a worksheet that can jump start
this conversation.

271
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:07,780
I put a checklist on the door on who needs
what in order to leave the house in the morning.

272
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:12,980
I realised that I was taking on the mental
burden of having to make sure that everybody

273
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:16,710
was ready in the morning, even on the days
that my husband was doing drop-off.

274
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:21,990
With this list, we can both make sure that
everyone has everything they need without

275
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:25,390
me needing to be the one that bears that burden.

276
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:30,300
Finally, if you need to leave your company,
leave your company.

277
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:35,090
Ultimately, if your company doesn't understand
the lifestyle of you as a parent and doesn't

278
00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:39,900
allow you to be with your children when you
need to be, then, if you can, try to leave.

279
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:44,870
This advice came up over and over again in
surveys, although admittedly, a lot has been

280
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:49,730
filled out by senior-level developers.

281
00:20:49,730 --> 00:20:53,950
So I that is disappear self-parent guilt,
self-care days, find a community, share the

282
00:20:53,950 --> 00:20:56,620
mental load and leave if you have to.

283
00:20:56,620 --> 00:21:02,620
For your teams, remember just existing as
a parent on your team makes your teams better.

284
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:09,500
You're organised, you need to set boundaries,
and you must have some sort of work-life balance.

285
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:13,030
Being this role model helps everyone, even
if they don't know that you're role-modelling

286
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:14,030
it.

287
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:17,460
A little while ago, my team had an os site
that I brought my family to.

288
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:21,811
In order for me to be available for dinner
and bedtime each evening, my day ended up

289
00:21:21,811 --> 00:21:25,770
at five and we didn't meet until 7.30.

290
00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:34,770
My team brought this about not knowing I had
created that break because I needed to balance

291
00:21:34,770 --> 00:21:38,320
running the offsite with being present for
my family.

292
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:42,790
When I told them the reason why the break
existed, they saw that not only did that benefit

293
00:21:42,790 --> 00:21:47,420
me and my family but it also benefitted them
by giving them a chance to recharge before

294
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:48,980
evening activities.

295
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:53,830
Finally, we're going to talk about what colleagues
can do because colleagues with or without

296
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:58,750
children have lots of power to make things
better for team-mates and make companies better

297
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:00,190
in general.

298
00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:02,770
First, ask about lactation rooms.

299
00:22:02,770 --> 00:22:06,060
If you live in a country where moms are still
pumping when they return to work.

300
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:11,290
I was at a conference once in America, and
I needed a place to pump, and I asked the

301
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:15,240
front desk person if there was a space other
than the bathroom to do so.

302
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:19,910
He said, "I think we have a supply closet
somewhere that you can use."

303
00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:25,120
Fortunately, there was a security guard standing
nearby who walked over and said my wife's

304
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:30,520
going through the same thing, I'm sure we
can do better than a bathroom or supply closet,

305
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:35,690
and let me look around for you quickly, and
sure enough, they found me an empty office.

306
00:22:35,690 --> 00:22:37,130
Mothers should not be alone in this fight.

307
00:22:37,130 --> 00:22:41,980
If you're company is moving into a new space
or spending money building something out,

308
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:45,880
suggest they make appropriate accommodations
for mothers returning to work, and if they

309
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:49,950
don't know what those are, there are plenty
of women who would be happy to talk to them

310
00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:51,170
about it.

311
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:54,070
Second, just be friendly.

312
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:57,430
This one is easy, but when folks are coming
back, ask what they're doing.

313
00:22:57,430 --> 00:23:03,640
Coming back to work can be emotional, check
in, show them that you care, and appreciated,

314
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:06,550
and supported really makes a difference.

315
00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:10,120
Third, make your voice heard.

316
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:15,640
Someone suggests working late, or schedule
late meetings, see someone criticising a parent

317
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:20,470
for needing to take time because their child
is sick or has a doctor's appointment, parents

318
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:25,010
often feel really guilty about taking this
time, or saying, "I have to go, I have to

319
00:23:25,010 --> 00:23:26,950
run to pick up my chilled."

320
00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:31,750
It's helpful for others on the team to speak
up as well and say I know this meeting is

321
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:35,540
running over, we want to be respectful of
those with the hard stuff.

322
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:38,190
Or is there any chance we can schedule this
meeting earlier?

323
00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:41,460
I know it doesn't work for everyone's schedule.

324
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:47,590
Finally, if someone uses a word or concept
that you don't know, Google it.

325
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:50,419
I like to think that most of us are pretty
good at Google.

326
00:23:50,419 --> 00:23:54,420
We generally like learning new things, so
if you don't know what pumping is, curious

327
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:59,780
about childcare costs, never heard of a sleep
progression or anything that the parent mentions

328
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:01,170
on your team, Google it.

329
00:24:01,170 --> 00:24:04,710
There are great resources out there to learn
more.

330
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:09,540
That summary is lactation rooms, be nice,
speak up, and use Google.

331
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:14,120
While there are specific things that colleagues
can do to help parents, these actions benefit

332
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:16,660
everyone and make teams stronger.

333
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:22,070
These suggestions boil down to increasing
empathy and curiosity, and an interest in

334
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:26,370
your colleagues and their lives, as well as
a desire to understand one another.

335
00:24:26,370 --> 00:24:32,220
When these factors are incorporated into a
team's DNA, it leads to stronger, more effective

336
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:36,390
teams that can support and understand one
another more effectively.

337
00:24:36,390 --> 00:24:40,990
You may ask about lactation rooms specifically
to support parents on your team, but you're

338
00:24:40,990 --> 00:24:46,940
also learning to recognise difference situations
where different accommodations are helpful.

339
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:50,630
You're learning how to support team-mates
by asking questions and figuring out how to

340
00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:56,390
be a better ally on your team, and teams that
are strong in these areas help attract and

341
00:24:56,390 --> 00:24:58,070
remain more diverse talent.

342
00:24:58,070 --> 00:25:00,960
There are some great resources out there.

343
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:04,110
You can take a look at how your company is
doing, or how companies you're looking at

344
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:14,720
are doing.

345
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:18,790
The number-one piece of advice that I got
on surveys was that you will never get this

346
00:25:18,790 --> 00:25:20,500
time with your children back.

347
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:25,140
So value it, prioritise it, and try to guard
it as much as possible.

348
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:30,440
There are some days that I still feel like
I'm not sure I can be a successful mom and

349
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:35,630
in tech, but there are some days that I can
give 100 per cent to both areas, and others

350
00:25:35,630 --> 00:25:39,750
where I feel like I'm letting my family or
my job down.

351
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:45,460
Oftentimes, though, I find myself calling
on developer or manager strategies for effective

352
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:47,610
parenting where or vice versa.

353
00:25:47,610 --> 00:25:51,720
I personally think this makes me a better
manager and gives me more experiences and

354
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:57,150
strategies I can call upon in a variety of
situations.

355
00:25:57,150 --> 00:26:02,540
What I also learned through speaking with
parents and people in the amazing parents

356
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:08,140
that answered a few questions, is that the
struggle that I face are not unique.

357
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:13,460
It's important for all of us as a community,
as developers, as colleagues, as peers, and

358
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:14,780
managers to think about this.

359
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:20,100
I thought that everything that I was feeling
was just me, but it's everyone.

360
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:24,080
Everyone has similar concerns, and a lot of
people have the same issues.

361
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:28,670
So let's think about how we can make it better,
because they're solvable.

362
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:33,460
Peers with or without children, managers,
directors of engineering, we can make the

363
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:38,090
lives of the parents in tech better which
will ultimately make our teams and companies

364
00:26:38,090 --> 00:26:40,690
better.

365
00:26:40,690 --> 00:26:44,990
This research is ongoing, so feel free to
check out my Twitter if you want to fill it

366
00:26:44,990 --> 00:26:53,220
out, and, parents, as one person wrote on
their survey, just high-fives.

367
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:56,380
You're awesome!

368
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:59,550
Be confident!

369
00:26:59,550 --> 00:27:02,720
Thank you.
