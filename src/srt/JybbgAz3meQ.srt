00:00:06,310 --> 00:00:10,420

can everyone hear me okay cool

2
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:13,940
hi I'm Amy well bellow I go by cellular

3
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:15,290
Hg on the Internet

4
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:17,510
I'm a programmer and electrical engineer

5
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:19,660
by trade with an interest in combining

6
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:22,009
computing an art and an interest in

7
00:00:22,009 --> 00:00:24,529
making STEM education more inclusive and

8
00:00:24,529 --> 00:00:27,860
accessible after working as a web

9
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:30,140
developer for several years a couple

10
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:31,669
years ago I founded my own company

11
00:00:31,669 --> 00:00:34,160
called bubble sort genes to try to write

12
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,200
learning materials to make computer

13
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:38,420
science concept more inclusive and

14
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:39,830
accessible with stories and

15
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:43,940
illustrations and in that vein this

16
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:45,320
presentation is going to use

17
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:47,240
illustrations to help prove the

18
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:49,070
algorithm to calculate the phase of the

19
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:54,980
Moon so let me set the scene for you it

20
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:57,020
was midnight and the which side in her

21
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:59,360
tower boom as midnight as the moonlight

22
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:01,640
danced through the window she was deep

23
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:05,600
in thought and calculation these runes

24
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,430
were giving her trouble but she felt

25
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:09,320
confident that she could solve them and

26
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:11,539
with them the secrets of the moon with a

27
00:01:11,539 --> 00:01:14,569
few more tries the runes keeping her

28
00:01:14,569 --> 00:01:17,060
awake and keeping her from the secrets

29
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:19,640
of the moon weren't Egyptian hieroglyphs

30
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:22,039
nor ancient etruscan they were

31
00:01:22,039 --> 00:01:25,639
trigonometry if you two have been

32
00:01:25,639 --> 00:01:27,770
frustrated or terrified by trigonometry

33
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:30,560
fret not would it be as satisfying to

34
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,079
unlock the secrets of the universe if it

35
00:01:33,079 --> 00:01:35,270
were straightforward it might be

36
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:37,280
challenging but we can do it right now

37
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,700
here together let's use trigonometry to

38
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:44,869
calculate the phases of the Moon so a

39
00:01:44,869 --> 00:01:46,310
couple months ago I found this

40
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:47,689
JavaScript library that makes

41
00:01:47,689 --> 00:01:50,029
astronomical calculations including this

42
00:01:50,029 --> 00:01:52,279
function for calculating what fraction

43
00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:54,409
of the moon is illuminated on any given

44
00:01:54,409 --> 00:01:54,909
day

45
00:01:54,909 --> 00:01:57,590
my first thought to myself was whoa this

46
00:01:57,590 --> 00:02:01,670
library is rad my second thought was can

47
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:03,020
I prove this equation from first

48
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:05,869
principle and when I say first

49
00:02:05,869 --> 00:02:08,240
principles I mean very first principles

50
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:10,069
let's start off with a very basic

51
00:02:10,069 --> 00:02:14,260
question what even is a moon phase

52
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:15,950
depending on the day

53
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:18,500
sometimes we see the moon as a crust

54
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,780
sometimes we see half of the moon lit

55
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:23,390
and sometimes we see the moon as a full

56
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:28,790
circle what causes this so here we have

57
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:31,940
the Sun the earth and the moon which

58
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:33,980
orbits around the earth these are not

59
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:38,030
drawn to scale at all that's why notice

60
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:40,160
that as the moon orbits around the earth

61
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,460
the side facing the Sun is the only side

62
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:47,960
that is illuminated imagine standing on

63
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:50,270
earth as the moon is in each of these

64
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:52,160
different points in its orbit around the

65
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:52,610
Earth

66
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:55,130
for example let's imagine standing on

67
00:02:55,130 --> 00:02:57,320
earth looking towards the moon in the

68
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:00,230
direction of this arrow while the moon

69
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:03,350
is at its rightmost position here what

70
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:07,459
you see from Earth is from the arrows

71
00:03:07,459 --> 00:03:09,290
point of view is the unlit side of the

72
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:13,370
moon what we know as a new moon now

73
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:15,800
let's imagine standing on earth looking

74
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,630
towards the moon in the direction of

75
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:20,390
this arrow while the moon is at its

76
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:23,810
bottom most position here what you see

77
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:27,200
from Earth is that half of the circle of

78
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,360
the moon is illuminated what we know

79
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,769
somewhat confusingly as a quarter moon

80
00:03:32,769 --> 00:03:35,390
now let's imagine standing on earth

81
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:37,459
looking towards the moon in the

82
00:03:37,459 --> 00:03:38,959
direction of this arrow while the moon

83
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:41,690
is at the leftmost position here what

84
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:43,670
you see from Earth from the arrows point

85
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:46,040
of view is the full illuminated face of

86
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:50,420
the moon known as a full moon cool so

87
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:52,549
now we know that the moon phase depends

88
00:03:52,549 --> 00:03:54,500
on the relative positions of the moon

89
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:58,299
earth and Sun let's define some terms

90
00:03:58,299 --> 00:04:01,340
the algorithm that we looked at uses two

91
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:03,350
different angles which are labeled in

92
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:04,880
the comments as the geocentric

93
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,980
elongation of a moon from the Sun and

94
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:09,350
the Cellino centric elongation of the

95
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:11,060
Earth's from the Sun what does that even

96
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:14,660
mean so the word geocentric means

97
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:17,239
centering the earth in other words it

98
00:04:17,239 --> 00:04:19,070
means making calculations from the

99
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:21,500
Earth's point of view as if the Moon and

100
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,630
Sun revolved around it we know that this

101
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:25,850
was not actually true but it just refers

102
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:27,530
to using this reference point for

103
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:32,090
calculations the word Celino centric

104
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:34,639
centering the moon in other words it

105
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:37,040
means making calculations from the point

106
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,800
of view of the moon as if the Earth and

107
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:42,560
the Sun revolved around it again this is

108
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,750
not actually true but it just refers to

109
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:46,340
using this reference point for

110
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:51,020
calculations and let's use these points

111
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:53,419
of view to define some angles we might

112
00:04:53,419 --> 00:04:56,450
use in our calculations we'll use the

113
00:04:56,450 --> 00:04:59,510
angle between the moon and the Sun from

114
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:01,070
the Earth's point of view and we'll call

115
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:03,380
that Phi this is the geocentric

116
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:06,229
elongation of the moon from the Sun that

117
00:05:06,229 --> 00:05:10,040
the code was referring to will also use

118
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:12,110
the angle between the Earth and the Sun

119
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:14,150
from the moon's point of view and we'll

120
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:17,090
call that theta theta is this Celino

121
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:19,010
centric elongation of the moon from the

122
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:21,710
Sun that the code was referring to the

123
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:24,169
code was using the variable name ink but

124
00:05:24,169 --> 00:05:25,700
that isn't a Greek letter so let's call

125
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:30,050
it theta instead at this point it's

126
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:32,150
worth remembering that the Earth Moon

127
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:34,490
and Sun are three points in space so

128
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:37,250
they form a triangle what information in

129
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:40,610
this triangle do we know one of the

130
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:42,710
sides of the triangle has length equal

131
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:45,260
to the distance between the moon and the

132
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:47,720
earth this is a known distance and this

133
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,850
distance doesn't change as the moon

134
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:51,650
revolves around the earth and as the

135
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:55,610
Earth revolves around the Sun the

136
00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:57,350
distance between the earth and the Sun

137
00:05:57,350 --> 00:06:00,320
is also a known distance so we know the

138
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:04,160
length of that side of the triangle the

139
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,139
last side of the triangle will change in

140
00:06:06,139 --> 00:06:08,120
length depending on the angles between

141
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:11,030
the Earth Moon and Sun do we know any of

142
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:13,669
those angles well by the geocentric

143
00:06:13,669 --> 00:06:16,280
elongation of the moon from the Sun that

144
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:19,070
we were referring to the in other words

145
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:21,410
the angle that the Moon and Sun formed

146
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:22,820
from the point of view of the Earth is

147
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:25,370
something that we can observe given that

148
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:30,080
we are on earth it's not a constant but

149
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,460
since we can observe and measure it

150
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:34,940
let's count it is known with this

151
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:37,160
information we can calculate the last

152
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:41,330
side see with a law of cosines a quick

153
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:43,180
refresher on the law of cosines

154
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:45,700
it lets you calculate the length of an

155
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:48,010
unknown side of a triangle given its

156
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:50,700
opposite angle and two other sides

157
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:53,770
so given that we know the values for Phi

158
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:58,000
a and B see the distance between the

159
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,580
moon and the Sun is then the square root

160
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:04,360
of a squared plus B squared minus 2a B

161
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:08,650
cosine Phi and now that we know the

162
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:11,890
length of C we can calculate theta the

163
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:14,200
angle between the Earth and the Sun from

164
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,150
the moon's point of view and we can

165
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:19,540
calculate it using the law of sines so

166
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:21,520
quick refresher on the law of sines if

167
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:24,130
we know all the sides of the triangle

168
00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:27,370
and one angle we can calculate the rest

169
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:30,220
of the angles via the law of sines the

170
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:32,500
law of sine states that the sine of an

171
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,420
angle divided by the length of the side

172
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:37,660
opposite that angle is equal to the sine

173
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:39,280
of any other angle in that triangle

174
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,230
divided by the length of the side

175
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:44,110
opposite that angle so in the case of

176
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:46,810
our triangle we can say that the sine of

177
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:49,570
Phi divided by C equals the sine of

178
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:52,570
theta divided by B and we can substitute

179
00:07:52,570 --> 00:07:55,000
in the value of C that we calculated

180
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,580
from the law of cosines to get the

181
00:07:57,580 --> 00:08:00,880
answer for the sine of theta and then

182
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:03,280
knowing the sine of theta theta is then

183
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:07,690
the arc sine of that value now that we

184
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:10,000
know how to calculate theta the angle

185
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,400
between the Earth and the Sun from the

186
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,590
point of view of the moon let's see how

187
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:17,800
it's related to the moon phase you might

188
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,780
notice that as the moon revolves around

189
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:22,360
the earth and changes phase theta

190
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:25,660
changes to can we find the equation that

191
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:27,640
describes the relationship between theta

192
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,860
and the fraction of the moon that's

193
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:32,980
visible from Earth to make it clearer

194
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:35,110
what part of the Moon is visible from

195
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:37,540
Earth at different points in its phase

196
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:40,270
we're adding a color key the white area

197
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:43,570
is a part illuminated by the Sun the

198
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:45,730
lavender area is the part not

199
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:49,390
illuminated by the Sun and finally the

200
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:51,610
dark purple area covers the side of the

201
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:54,340
Moon that faces away from Earth so the

202
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:56,770
white area that's left is what we can

203
00:08:56,770 --> 00:08:57,209
see

204
00:08:57,209 --> 00:09:02,919
the moon from the earths point of view

205
00:09:02,929 --> 00:09:04,079
okay

206
00:09:04,079 --> 00:09:05,970
so we'll try to figure out the equation

207
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:07,679
that describes the relationship between

208
00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:10,649
theta and what fraction of the moon is

209
00:09:10,649 --> 00:09:13,740
illuminated and visible from Earth let's

210
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:16,290
look at very specific example angles

211
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:19,350
when the angle between the Earth and Sun

212
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:21,540
from the point of the view of the moon

213
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:25,350
is 180 degrees the illumination percent

214
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:29,910
visible from Earth is zero when the

215
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:32,189
angle between the Earth and the Sun from

216
00:09:32,189 --> 00:09:35,970
the point of the Moon point of view of

217
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:37,529
the moon is zero degrees the

218
00:09:37,529 --> 00:09:40,679
illumination percent is a hundred a full

219
00:09:40,679 --> 00:09:43,639
moon but those are very specific

220
00:09:43,639 --> 00:09:47,699
examples how is theta related to the

221
00:09:47,699 --> 00:09:50,129
fraction of the Moon that's visible for

222
00:09:50,129 --> 00:09:54,689
any arbitrary value of theta so let's

223
00:09:54,689 --> 00:09:59,670
zoom in to try to figure that out we do

224
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:02,040
know that the Sun lights exactly half of

225
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:04,980
the moon the right half and forms a

226
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:07,410
perpendicular side perpendicular with a

227
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:09,480
side of the moon that's lit so we can

228
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:12,439
mark that perpendicular that

229
00:10:12,439 --> 00:10:14,699
perpendicular means that we can mark

230
00:10:14,699 --> 00:10:18,240
this bottom lit area as having angle 90

231
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:22,829
minus theta the earth also forms a

232
00:10:22,829 --> 00:10:24,749
perpendicular with a side of the moon

233
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:27,809
that is visible from Earth the side

234
00:10:27,809 --> 00:10:30,269
opposite the dark purple side so we can

235
00:10:30,269 --> 00:10:32,249
mark that as well this perpendicular

236
00:10:32,249 --> 00:10:35,610
means that we can mark this upper lip

237
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:39,179
area as having angle 90 minus theta as

238
00:10:39,179 --> 00:10:44,519
well so adding up all of the lit areas

239
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:48,899
of the moon the lit area of the moon

240
00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:52,259
spans an angle of 100 minus theta or in

241
00:10:52,259 --> 00:10:58,079
radians pi minus theta so to calculate

242
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:00,869
the illumination percent of fraction

243
00:11:00,869 --> 00:11:06,209
from the illumination angle we can

244
00:11:06,209 --> 00:11:10,350
naively make this calculation

245
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:14,030
using the angle illuminated by divided

246
00:11:14,030 --> 00:11:17,120
by the total angle visible so the angle

247
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,670
illuminated is pi minus theta and the

248
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:24,930
total angle visible is 180 degrees or pi

249
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:27,740
but this doesn't accurately describe the

250
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:29,840
illuminated percent that we see because

251
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:32,480
the moon is a sphere and not a circle

252
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,310
and we need to take into account the

253
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:35,900
moon's curvature and how our eyes

254
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:40,430
perceive that curvature so instead we

255
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:42,170
want to calculate the length of the

256
00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:44,480
projection of the curved surface of the

257
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:48,650
moon that are icy how do we calculate

258
00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:53,750
that projection let's assume we know the

259
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:59,990
radius of a moon which we do when we

260
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:02,570
project our down we see that it's going

261
00:12:02,570 --> 00:12:04,610
to be a portion of the distance that we

262
00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:08,660
care about what is the other portion the

263
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:10,880
other portion of the distance is a leg

264
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:15,170
of this right triangle with hypotenuse R

265
00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:19,040
and inner angle theta since the inner

266
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,710
angle forms a straight line with angle

267
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:25,640
PI minus theta and we know from trig

268
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:28,340
that the length of a side adjacent to an

269
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:30,350
angle in any right triangle is the

270
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:32,090
hypotenuse times the cosine of that

271
00:12:32,090 --> 00:12:33,710
angle that's the definition of the

272
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:36,620
cosine right adjacent over hypotenuse so

273
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:38,330
now we know that the length of the top

274
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:43,580
side of the right triangle is R cosine

275
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:45,650
theta and we can project that down to

276
00:12:45,650 --> 00:12:47,960
the distance that we care about adding

277
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:51,440
those two projected values together now

278
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,450
we know the length of the projection of

279
00:12:53,450 --> 00:12:55,730
the illuminated portion of the moon as

280
00:12:55,730 --> 00:13:00,740
visible from Earth to calculate the

281
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:03,290
fraction illuminated we divide by the

282
00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:05,480
total projection which is the diameter

283
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:09,200
of the moon in other words to are when

284
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,420
we simplify the moon's radius cancels

285
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:13,520
itself out and we're left with cosine

286
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:17,750
theta plus 1 over 2 does that look

287
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:18,200
familiar

288
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:21,350
so K we did it from first principles we

289
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:22,220
calculated

290
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:25,280
the same equation as this library for

291
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,570
the fraction of the moon that's

292
00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:31,490
illuminated so to recap the fraction of

293
00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:33,680
a moon illuminated at any point in time

294
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,500
can be calculated with a cosine of theta

295
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:39,410
plus 1 over 2 where theta is the angle

296
00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:41,930
between the Earth and the Sun from the

297
00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:45,440
moon's point of view so I know that's a

298
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:48,020
lot of information to digest at once so

299
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:49,820
I put all of it together in an

300
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:51,470
interactive website for you to mess

301
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:53,480
around with on your own if you'd like

302
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,670
and it uses an interactive scrolling

303
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:59,000
library colds called scroll llama made

304
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,070
by the data visualization site the

305
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:01,720
pudding

306
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:04,310
currently it's only desktop friendly but

307
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:06,080
I'm working on making it mobile-friendly

308
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:10,080
soon and I can briefly demo it right now

309
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:15,570
[Music]

310
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:18,520
ok

311
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:29,170
as you scroll it'll kind of like have

312
00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:33,550
some of the interactions from the

313
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:43,140
presentation

314
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:45,850
like it also we add all the pieces of

315
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:47,290
information that we know about this

316
00:14:47,290 --> 00:15:01,850
triangle

317
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:05,760
or so we add all the angles that we

318
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:09,900
figure out in the zoomed in image of the

319
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:13,440
moon and theta yeah so it's a which eco

320
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:27,840
slash trig if you want to mess around

321
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:30,310
yeah so that's it thanks for listening
