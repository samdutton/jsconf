00:00:00,079 --> 00:00:03,990

yes normal day for me so hi I'm

2
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:08,000
Cassandra I am currently funemployed but

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,650
that may change soon for reasons I can't

4
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:13,950
get into um anyway I'm gonna go to my

5
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:17,029
slides cool this is all mirrored awesome

6
00:00:17,029 --> 00:00:18,690
should me see if I can change the

7
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:22,859
resolution to that without it like

8
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:32,309
yelling at me awesome cool alright so

9
00:00:32,309 --> 00:00:34,890
I'm like the slides indicate i'm here to

10
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:36,600
talk about my nodebots outfit from

11
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:39,840
version 0.1 point zero two zero to two

12
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,090
point five point zero which is what I'm

13
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:43,440
wearing right now and I'll go into each

14
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,590
part of the outfit in just a bit but

15
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:48,090
first a little bit about my personal

16
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:50,520
story of robots art in Redemption so

17
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:53,010
when I was a kid I was an inventor um I

18
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:54,870
had access to a ridiculous amount of

19
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:56,940
Robo lab equipment my mom's an educator

20
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:58,649
and so every summer she would bring home

21
00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:00,359
the Robo lab equipment from her school

22
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:03,059
and I get to play with it and I built

23
00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:04,799
things like vending machines and coins

24
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:07,020
orders and and tennis ball four homers

25
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:09,390
for the dog and I also the best fashion

26
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:12,150
sense my art can't quite communicate to

27
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:13,770
you how awesome I looked in a yellow t

28
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:15,509
shirt and plaid pants but I swear I

29
00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:18,840
rocked that anyway the best fashion

30
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:21,119
sense and I was an inventor but then I

31
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:24,869
had to grow up um so I actually started

32
00:01:24,869 --> 00:01:27,119
my college education pursuing a degree

33
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:28,470
in chemistry because I had spent the

34
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:30,229
last four years of high school being

35
00:01:30,229 --> 00:01:33,060
treated terribly by the computer science

36
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:36,060
community and so I decided no I'm done

37
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:37,829
with this and I was told I couldn't make

38
00:01:37,829 --> 00:01:39,270
a living in art so I was told not to go

39
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:40,500
to art school so I can go to art school

40
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:41,820
I didn't go for a computer science

41
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:43,770
degree I end up finishing with one but I

42
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:45,479
didn't start it I started with a

43
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:46,920
chemistry degree because i was told that

44
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:49,860
being a woman in tech was was terrible

45
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:51,090
and i was told all these things in high

46
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:54,329
school like oh how many how many guys

47
00:01:54,329 --> 00:01:55,619
were on your team that helped you code

48
00:01:55,619 --> 00:01:57,060
every time I did a team project they

49
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:58,290
always assume the guys did the code

50
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:00,719
things like that and the funny thing

51
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:01,950
about being a victim of the pipeline

52
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:04,049
problem is it actually really prepared

53
00:02:04,049 --> 00:02:06,719
me for being intact because I get the

54
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:09,030
same now that I did then but

55
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:10,319
it's really just wrapped in a faux

56
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:12,690
incredulous attitude now like what used

57
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:13,150
to be

58
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:14,409
oh but women aren't computer for

59
00:02:14,409 --> 00:02:16,120
computer programmers now it's wait

60
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,709
you're really a computer programmer wait

61
00:02:17,709 --> 00:02:20,140
you really do robots so being a victim

62
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,430
of the pipeline problem was actually

63
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:22,930
kind of funny because now that I'm in

64
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:24,250
the tech scene it's pretty much the same

65
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:27,159
stuff it's just like I said full

66
00:02:27,159 --> 00:02:31,870
incredulous but j/s comp 2013 everything

67
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:33,220
I had gotten my computer science degree

68
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:34,900
but I I was a front-end web developer I

69
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:37,239
wasn't I wasn't an inventor anymore and

70
00:02:37,239 --> 00:02:39,220
I certainly didn't do a lot of art but

71
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:42,189
what happened at jas comp 2013 is Rick

72
00:02:42,189 --> 00:02:44,409
Alvarez and Rick Waldron gave a talk at

73
00:02:44,409 --> 00:02:46,299
a workshop on how to do node BOTS and we

74
00:02:46,299 --> 00:02:48,430
all got a little arduino uno in our bag

75
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:52,269
and without them and then additionally

76
00:02:52,269 --> 00:02:54,400
people like CJ Silverio and Francis

77
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,079
colada and Sarah Gorecki and like the

78
00:02:56,079 --> 00:02:58,750
node bought community in general I was

79
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:00,430
seriously about to quit check just

80
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:02,950
before the 2013 jazz comp I actually

81
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:05,049
went as an SOI was planning on quitting

82
00:03:05,049 --> 00:03:08,170
tack and my so at the time was a web

83
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:09,129
developer he says like you should come

84
00:03:09,129 --> 00:03:11,260
see this you can see this node boxing

85
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:14,079
and I'm so he dragged me to it and I was

86
00:03:14,079 --> 00:03:15,790
like oh yeah fine whatever but without

87
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:17,199
them I don't think I would still be

88
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:18,310
intact i think i still would have quit

89
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:19,959
but because of the node box community

90
00:03:19,959 --> 00:03:21,459
and i'll go into why a little bit later

91
00:03:21,459 --> 00:03:23,799
it gets a wonderful community if you're

92
00:03:23,799 --> 00:03:24,910
all interested in hard-wearing you

93
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:26,919
should check it out and thanks to that

94
00:03:26,919 --> 00:03:29,290
I'm back I am totally an inventor again

95
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:31,150
I am an artist again I am everything

96
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:33,579
that little 56 year old me wanted me

97
00:03:33,579 --> 00:03:36,010
like as an adult to be I remember I was

98
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:38,349
just doing my hair last week while

99
00:03:38,349 --> 00:03:40,269
wearing all of this and I thought wow if

100
00:03:40,269 --> 00:03:43,120
you told ten-year-old me that this would

101
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,639
be meat like now she would lose her mind

102
00:03:45,639 --> 00:03:47,769
like she would be supremely happy and

103
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:48,699
probably wouldn't have tried to quick

104
00:03:48,699 --> 00:03:50,889
tech in the first place um but yeah no

105
00:03:50,889 --> 00:03:52,690
I'm back I'm an inventor and artist

106
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:57,330
again and it's awesome

107
00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:00,079
it's been a really interesting journey

108
00:04:00,079 --> 00:04:01,930
for the past year and a half though um

109
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:04,189
I've done all these things learned how

110
00:04:04,189 --> 00:04:06,590
to do all these things I'm naturally an

111
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:08,530
introvert and I'm mildly autistic so

112
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:11,120
keep in mind that like just being up on

113
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,709
stage is still like a thing where i'm

114
00:04:12,709 --> 00:04:15,409
like whoa wait what so yeah I'll go into

115
00:04:15,409 --> 00:04:16,579
a little bit about as well why talk

116
00:04:16,579 --> 00:04:22,190
about the outfit so um this video is my

117
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:25,520
first node bot oh it's fine if you can't

118
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,380
hear it because all of this is me

119
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:29,479
talking to my dad so my father is an

120
00:04:29,479 --> 00:04:31,970
electrical engineer and this is from

121
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:34,100
Jay's comp 2013 I had just built my

122
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:36,530
first robot what it was was that web

123
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:38,720
page you could set the color of that RGB

124
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,720
LED from the web page I built that in 18

125
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,669
hours thanks to Rick and Raquel's

126
00:04:43,669 --> 00:04:45,260
tireless dedication teaching me

127
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:52,140
everything I needed to know about are

128
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:55,430
like don't ya it's a big joke but like

129
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:57,800
that's what i did in 18 hours and that's

130
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:01,849
really what sparked this is that because

131
00:05:01,849 --> 00:05:03,979
when i learned that i could go from not

132
00:05:03,979 --> 00:05:05,240
knowing anything about arduino to

133
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,130
building that in 18 hours i thought well

134
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:09,110
what else can I do what else you know

135
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:10,789
where else can I go so like I said I

136
00:05:10,789 --> 00:05:11,840
remembered I'm an inventor and I

137
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,490
remembered I'm an artist and I spent the

138
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:17,030
three months after j/s cops 2013 I was

139
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:18,860
working part-time so I spent every time

140
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:21,530
every moment I wasn't working on client

141
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:23,539
work I was working on robots and I built

142
00:05:23,539 --> 00:05:25,520
just about everything under the Sun with

143
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,530
RGB LEDs in color and I really like

144
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:28,940
playing with light and color so I kind

145
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:30,199
of stuck to that because I wasn't like

146
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:33,830
doing much else so then I learned how

147
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:36,590
not to be afraid because most of the

148
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:38,449
stuff that I've built of course the

149
00:05:38,449 --> 00:05:39,889
skirts freaking out because it's demo

150
00:05:39,889 --> 00:05:42,949
day just because it hasn't been done

151
00:05:42,949 --> 00:05:45,169
doesn't mean it can't I've not found a

152
00:05:45,169 --> 00:05:48,349
skirt like this yet and when I wanted to

153
00:05:48,349 --> 00:05:49,430
build it the first thing I did was

154
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:51,080
google to find someone else who did it

155
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,880
so I could copy them and when no one did

156
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,830
it I go wow too bad i'll just go build

157
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:57,229
something else and then I can't remember

158
00:05:57,229 --> 00:05:59,300
who i think it mighta been Raquel she

159
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:00,139
was like why don't you just build it

160
00:06:00,139 --> 00:06:02,419
anyway that's like oh right I can do

161
00:06:02,419 --> 00:06:04,190
that I don't have to like wait for

162
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:05,300
someone else to do this I can do it

163
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:08,510
myself and and I can code I can stay up

164
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:09,950
all night I can do this and the

165
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:11,210
thing is I can't be afraid of the trolls

166
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:14,000
actually when I built my skirt I was

167
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,850
worried that some stupid person would

168
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:18,500
say some stupid thing at some conference

169
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,360
and I would never want to wear the skirt

170
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,280
again and a lot of people backed me up

171
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,450
and said hey look you can't be afraid

172
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:25,010
you know I know it's I know and if

173
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:26,810
someone will actually that was the best

174
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:29,690
comfort I got which was someone will but

175
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:30,800
you got to learn how to live fast and

176
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,790
you gotta learn how to move through it

177
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:35,420
so yeah so I'm going to go into the the

178
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:37,370
construction of the first node BOTS

179
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:39,950
dress and this was premiered at jas comp

180
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:42,500
2014 in june of this year i started

181
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,270
building it in March I was so excited

182
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:45,770
that I just kind of got started really

183
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:48,790
early I don't have a ton of photos uh

184
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:51,050
and i have to mention no cats were

185
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:52,310
harmed in the making of this dress but

186
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:53,300
one felt he wasn't getting enough

187
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:55,880
attention um he would actually jump up

188
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,380
in my lap and get between me and the

189
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:58,850
dress and just like stare at me until i

190
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:00,080
would pat him for a livin and he won her

191
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,870
off so that I and you can kind of even

192
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:04,040
see like the cat hair on the dress

193
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,740
because ace wouldn't leave it alone so

194
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:08,990
about the dress it was powered by an S

195
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:10,160
Purina that I just got enough

196
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,660
Kickstarter if you've never seen in s

197
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:13,940
Purina before they're about half the

198
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:16,610
size of a credit card and they run a

199
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:19,490
modified version of JavaScript like on

200
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:21,290
the board so you don't have to there's

201
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:23,390
no see there's no Johnny Five wrappers

202
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:25,820
there's no tethering it's just running a

203
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,170
modified version of java script on the

204
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:29,360
board and the reason i picked the board

205
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,160
at the time was it was the easiest

206
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,650
smallest wireless way to handle

207
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:35,900
individually addressable RGB LEDs which

208
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:38,420
is what the the skirt is it's got one

209
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:41,180
data pin of course again demo day it

210
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:42,320
just doesn't want to work up today

211
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:46,370
anyway so I also used a photocell which

212
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:49,460
you can see on the left side of the

213
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:52,070
lapel that was to match the lights to

214
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:53,780
ambient light these get really bright

215
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:56,750
and so what I did was when the outside

216
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:58,460
was dim they would dim and when the

217
00:07:58,460 --> 00:07:59,660
outside was bright they would get

218
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:01,340
brighter so you could see them it sounds

219
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:02,540
like the inverse of what you want when

220
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:03,860
you think about it you want to be able

221
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:06,410
to see them and then them I forgot to

222
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:08,450
get pictures of jazz cause of my dress

223
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:10,190
so that's really like the only full

224
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:12,710
picture of the entire dress so one day

225
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:14,060
the one that I'm gonna go over what I

226
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:15,230
learned and I guess I forgot the bullet

227
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:18,740
point take lots of pictures of it anyway

228
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:20,390
uh always bring a backup power supply

229
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:22,910
the original node box dress was powered

230
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:23,600
by lithium

231
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,640
polymer battery the lithium polymer

232
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,200
batteries headers fell off the day

233
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,510
before the conference and I'm not

234
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:30,980
confident enough my soldering to put a

235
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:32,870
500-degree satire near life lithium

236
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:33,979
polymer battery I don't know many people

237
00:08:33,979 --> 00:08:36,020
that are so what I ended up doing was

238
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:37,460
taking you know those those big old

239
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:39,349
batteries you can plug a USB cable into

240
00:08:39,349 --> 00:08:41,300
like recharge your phone I didn't put

241
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:42,950
any one of those my purse running the

242
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:44,300
cable through to the back of the dress

243
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:46,160
to power the micro microcontroller and

244
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,600
using that as a power supply so always

245
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,270
bring a backup spot power supply

246
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:52,430
hardware debugging 50 RGB LEDs is tricky

247
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:54,080
and I think I'm really proving that

248
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,640
right now with the fact that my skirts

249
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:58,490
decided to freak out today and that I

250
00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:02,450
love making wearable robots all of the

251
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:04,310
strife all of the blood and there was

252
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:07,070
blood I can't so very well all of the

253
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:09,710
everything that went into that dress the

254
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:12,620
second i had a six-year-old girl walk up

255
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:15,860
to me and ask can I do this and are can

256
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:16,970
I do this when I grow up and I looked

257
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:18,440
down at her and went you can do this now

258
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:21,140
that made everything worth it so I

259
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:23,420
learned from that project that I love

260
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:25,220
doing this I love making wearable

261
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:27,140
robotics that do light in color and

262
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:29,900
possibly sound and all sorts of stuff so

263
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:33,620
I really don't and so when I got home

264
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:35,960
from Jas conf I knew immediately I was

265
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,730
going to build an outfit I was going to

266
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:39,470
take apart the dress figure out what

267
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:40,580
went wrong because there were a few

268
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:43,660
things that went wrong and rebuild and

269
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:46,070
so it started with the skirt the skirt

270
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:48,140
I'm wearing right now which is the first

271
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:51,260
part of version 2 it is premiered at

272
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:53,660
Thunder planes Jess about two months ago

273
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:56,870
and other than the flight here it's

274
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:59,540
never really sustain any damage I think

275
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:01,250
someone cut a wire in it because like a

276
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:02,990
really thick wire was cut when I got

277
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:04,460
here so I don't know if the TSA just

278
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:05,600
decided to go work and are happy or

279
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,100
whatever but there was actually some

280
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:08,270
damage to it when I got here but other

281
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:09,320
than that it's been pretty darn

282
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:12,620
resilience it's still powered by an S

283
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:14,450
Perino mostly because I just really like

284
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:17,180
the S ferrino code and I already had all

285
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:18,680
my algorithms written for it so I

286
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:21,560
rewrote it for the Esprit know so it's

287
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:23,270
actually the same LEDs I took apart the

288
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:25,460
old dress it does not exist anymore in a

289
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:27,140
current state mostly does the wiring was

290
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:29,300
so awful that I would have had to redo

291
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:31,460
all of it to keep the rest and because

292
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:33,380
it was sewn in I accidentally made a

293
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:35,240
couple holes trying to rewire it knows

294
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,020
just like you know I'm thought I'm just

295
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:36,430
going to

296
00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:38,050
the LEDs in recycle them plus these

297
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:39,970
discs LEDs that come from Adafruit are

298
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:42,730
not the cheapest 30 sheet of 25 is like

299
00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:45,880
$35 so you can I definitely want to

300
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:49,480
reuse it has a new wiring system part of

301
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,560
the reason the right side of the skirt

302
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,200
is freaking out and not the left is I

303
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,540
split the power into several different

304
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:58,390
rails because this is one chain of LEDs

305
00:10:58,390 --> 00:11:00,370
and before when I would put just one

306
00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:02,620
power in one ground rail the last led in

307
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:03,910
the the skirt would not be nearly as

308
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:05,950
bright as the first so I learned to fork

309
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:07,630
the power into four different rails so

310
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:09,010
that all for you know I could split it

311
00:11:09,010 --> 00:11:10,720
up to four different chains and they all

312
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,300
pretty much have the same brightness so

313
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:15,570
that's the more stable power system

314
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:17,890
where I learned from the skirt I still

315
00:11:17,890 --> 00:11:19,540
need conductive thread tech to get

316
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:22,360
better I really really do you show me a

317
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:25,089
a Kickstarter for a conductive thread

318
00:11:25,089 --> 00:11:27,640
that isn't really really awful and I

319
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:29,020
will show you I will find a million

320
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:33,850
dollars oh I will send wires which I

321
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:36,670
used 26 gauge silicone coated fin wires

322
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:39,190
they're great for flexibility but they

323
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:41,500
break for no reason you look at one of

324
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:42,760
these wires funny and they break so I

325
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,020
actually never rewiring the front of the

326
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:46,029
skirt before I came before i went to

327
00:11:46,029 --> 00:11:48,580
robots comp with thicker wire so i have

328
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:50,410
to like adjust i got to move the skirt

329
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:52,029
because though if a wire bends it'll

330
00:11:52,029 --> 00:11:53,860
bend the cloth with it but it also

331
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:56,080
doesn't break for no reason and then

332
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:56,980
when i finish this card i thought well

333
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:59,589
okay that's cool but now what where do I

334
00:11:59,589 --> 00:12:04,330
go next so then um while I was debuting

335
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:06,070
the dress I got a little bit inebriated

336
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:09,010
um and I ended up talking to a gentleman

337
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:12,070
named Ryan day maybe madam he works for

338
00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:15,700
Pinocchio and apparently I talked myself

339
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:17,800
into a dev kit for Pinocchio because he

340
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,390
handed me this little cardboard box and

341
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:20,410
then I woke up the next morning and like

342
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:23,560
Oh what I don't remember this and sure

343
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,930
enough there was Pinocchio in it and so

344
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:27,910
the first thing I thought it was a pair

345
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:30,160
of shoes because Bluffs right you know

346
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,690
it so if you've never seen a Pinocchio

347
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:33,610
before they're a mesh networking robotic

348
00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:35,230
system they speak to each other with a

349
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:37,420
low-power radio and then the lead scout

350
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:39,339
for any troop has a Wi-Fi shield or

351
00:12:39,339 --> 00:12:40,810
can't have a Wi-Fi shield that will

352
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:42,790
communicate with the internet so in the

353
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:46,120
case of my shoes the left shoe has a

354
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,770
Wi-Fi shield which is connected to my

355
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:50,170
phone's hotspot and the right shoe is

356
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:50,680
just a reg

357
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:52,360
troop and it communicates it gets

358
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,649
information from the internet by

359
00:12:53,649 --> 00:12:56,020
communicating with the left shoe so it's

360
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:57,730
like I said powered by Pinocchio I have

361
00:12:57,730 --> 00:12:59,860
a nitrous server that pulls down my

362
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:01,960
twitter user stream and watches for

363
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:04,270
favorites and when someone favorites

364
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:06,670
something I've tweeted online on the

365
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:08,380
shoes turn gold right now they pulse

366
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:10,630
purple the other thing I can do online

367
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:13,510
which is kind of fun is I can use their

368
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:17,200
HQ so right now you can kind of see

369
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:22,579
their pulsing purple I can actually tell

370
00:13:22,589 --> 00:13:24,820
i've done this demo enough if i can type

371
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:26,440
with one hand and hold my foot up and

372
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:30,040
stand on one foot so i'm going to change

373
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:36,430
these red I think that's righti so I

374
00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:38,410
think imma change the other shoe so I'm

375
00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:40,029
gonna wait for success it takes it takes

376
00:13:40,029 --> 00:13:43,089
a second sometimes it worked Oh did

377
00:13:43,089 --> 00:13:45,100
didn't it alright so now you can kind of

378
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:47,680
see Oh maneuver there it's now pulsing

379
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,779
red so this is kind of what the last

380
00:13:49,779 --> 00:13:51,130
speaker is getting into with a dedicated

381
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:53,560
cloud they set this up for you when you

382
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:55,150
when you set up a troop so you have this

383
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:57,580
at your disposal and all I do with my

384
00:13:57,580 --> 00:14:02,589
little nitrous server is I is I tell it

385
00:14:02,589 --> 00:14:04,510
when there's a favorite call this

386
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:06,279
function that makes it flash cold so

387
00:14:06,279 --> 00:14:09,940
yeah neat stuff so yeah really cool

388
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:12,130
platform really easy to debug as well

389
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:14,170
especially cuz them so for waterproofing

390
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:17,020
what I did was each Pinocchio is in a

391
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:19,750
waterproof radioshack enclosure and then

392
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:21,130
I just drilled holes for the wires and

393
00:14:21,130 --> 00:14:22,750
then hot glued around the wires sorry

394
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:24,250
waterproof it so they're waterproof

395
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:26,920
thank goodness Oh Florida I would have

396
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:29,260
been interesting without that and yeah

397
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:31,720
so my electric is swelling up pardon me

398
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,730
got robots flowing out of everywhere

399
00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:39,900
that's still flashing yes anyway

400
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:42,370
robotics demos are hard robotics is not

401
00:14:42,370 --> 00:14:45,279
hard robotics demos are hard so what I

402
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:47,140
learned from the shoes is people will

403
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:48,910
almost always laugh when you say

404
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:50,709
something like hold on I gotta charge or

405
00:14:50,709 --> 00:14:53,770
debug or paying my shoes um people who

406
00:14:53,770 --> 00:14:55,540
almost always laugh when you something

407
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:56,920
like that comes out of your mouth and

408
00:14:56,920 --> 00:15:00,010
now I have it with my hat to and sew

409
00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:01,300
sewing in the converse is easier than

410
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:02,890
you think if you just get the right

411
00:15:02,890 --> 00:15:04,000
sewing Neil

412
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,350
and like I said sometimes getting drunk

413
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:06,850
sometimes being drunk yields free

414
00:15:06,850 --> 00:15:10,630
hardware research is ongoing um I got a

415
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:12,340
lot of free hardware robots calm fine i

416
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:13,930
drank a lot of booze on a correlation

417
00:15:13,930 --> 00:15:18,760
causation so I'm not working on version

418
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:21,040
3 i'm halfway through version 3 i'm at

419
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:24,550
2.5 point 0 with this if you can see

420
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:26,200
it's actually the robots conf logo

421
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,880
that's because I this was part of the

422
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:32,140
robot conf goodie bag and I actually the

423
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:34,420
wearable speaker put regular LEDs and

424
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:35,920
like a battery and so which is like a

425
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,600
regular circuit and I'm like okay cool

426
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,090
i'm going to put RGB leds in it so i SAT

427
00:15:40,090 --> 00:15:42,070
there in like soldered RGB LEDs into a

428
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:44,140
beanie and this is what I got out of it

429
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:47,140
it's powered by an electric imp which is

430
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:48,370
actually really cool and I can show you

431
00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:50,020
because I didn't sew it into the Hat I

432
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:51,640
totally wasn't being lazy I did it on

433
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:55,360
purpose um so the electric imp is it's

434
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,490
an it's it looks like an SD card so this

435
00:15:57,490 --> 00:15:58,870
little SD card looking thing is the

436
00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:00,910
microcontroller and so like you plug it

437
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:02,530
into a shield like you would plug Sun SD

438
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:03,670
card into something and like it's got

439
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:06,010
the pins on the shield and then in my

440
00:16:06,010 --> 00:16:07,750
case it doesn't have a battery like

441
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:10,030
connector so I kind of put the battery

442
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:11,290
connector on the pins because you know

443
00:16:11,290 --> 00:16:14,050
that what's that legal disclaimer about

444
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:16,240
not you know mimicking me that might be

445
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,450
good right now better just fill it in it

446
00:16:18,450 --> 00:16:20,980
see I told you robots demos are hard

447
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:25,120
robots are really clumsy me today but

448
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,339
anyway yeah it's it still needs some

449
00:16:27,339 --> 00:16:28,960
code for interactivity it actually just

450
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:31,360
cycles through rainbows when it's hooked

451
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:34,180
up to power which I can still do this

452
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:36,670
come on there we go then you get back

453
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:39,850
there so yeah and what I learned from

454
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:42,100
this project is it be an easier way

455
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:43,690
hackable I'm getting conductive thread

456
00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:45,460
through the cloth of a beanie is just

457
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:47,260
leaving the only trick is leaving enough

458
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:48,280
conductive thread so that when the

459
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:49,839
beanie fabric stretches you have enough

460
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:51,220
conductive thread in there not snap

461
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:54,730
because it does not stretch also see

462
00:16:54,730 --> 00:16:56,050
number one of what I learned from the

463
00:16:56,050 --> 00:16:57,460
shoes yeah people will really find it

464
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:58,660
funny when you say hold on I got a ping

465
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:01,390
my hat squirrel is weird it's their

466
00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:04,300
their language cool weird and they have

467
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:05,800
this agent device setup which i think is

468
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,120
really cool because it's kind of what

469
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:10,180
I've set up for myself with my other

470
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:14,050
projects this is their ide and so you

471
00:17:14,050 --> 00:17:16,360
get a device and you you program and

472
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:17,439
squirrel the device

473
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:20,110
code and then you can it you can

474
00:17:20,110 --> 00:17:21,819
implicitly tell it to ping the agent

475
00:17:21,819 --> 00:17:23,199
which is the code on the left I actually

476
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:24,669
haven't done anything with the agent yet

477
00:17:24,669 --> 00:17:26,199
but they set all this up for you and

478
00:17:26,199 --> 00:17:27,669
they give you a nice little URL I should

479
00:17:27,669 --> 00:17:29,379
make this a little bigger they give you

480
00:17:29,379 --> 00:17:32,080
a nice little oh not that not that a

481
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,970
nice little URL at the top they'll let

482
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:35,980
you access your agent from like say a

483
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:37,720
node server or whatever so you can you

484
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,039
can do a minimal amount of squirrel and

485
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:40,179
then just like push it off to a node

486
00:17:40,179 --> 00:17:41,289
server for all the processing of

487
00:17:41,289 --> 00:17:43,750
whatever that's really cool and then um

488
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:46,899
yeah so I have one last kind of

489
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:48,820
wearables project that I'm still working

490
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:50,980
on so somebody at spark drop this off at

491
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:52,570
robots comp it's called their internet

492
00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:56,470
button and it's got 11 RGB LEDs I've got

493
00:17:56,470 --> 00:17:58,149
their little battery shield on it so

494
00:17:58,149 --> 00:18:00,039
that it can run without wires and then

495
00:18:00,039 --> 00:18:01,480
on the back it's got four buttons and

496
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:03,250
it's got an accelerometer on it I want

497
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:06,340
to make a wireless presentation advancer

498
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:08,559
with it so that it changes colors as I

499
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:09,669
move and then I hit the button to

500
00:18:09,669 --> 00:18:10,870
advance my slides but I'm not quite

501
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:12,490
there yet just wanted to show that off

502
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:13,570
because that's a really neat thing and

503
00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:16,269
the photons going to be awesome really

504
00:18:16,269 --> 00:18:18,720
really cool stuff coming up there so

505
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:22,809
back to my slides I also built a bunch

506
00:18:22,809 --> 00:18:23,950
of other stuff this year that wasn't

507
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:27,129
wearables I have an NPM module called

508
00:18:27,129 --> 00:18:29,529
open pixel control for controlling large

509
00:18:29,529 --> 00:18:33,220
amounts of RGB LEDs with beaglebone okay

510
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:35,950
oh so that the project on the left

511
00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:39,009
that's 1024 individually addressable RGB

512
00:18:39,009 --> 00:18:40,750
LEDs that I have arranged into a panel

513
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:43,059
at cascadia what it did is it would take

514
00:18:43,059 --> 00:18:44,889
your picture with a tehsil and then

515
00:18:44,889 --> 00:18:47,649
pixel eyes your picture and then put it

516
00:18:47,649 --> 00:18:49,750
on the grid and I have a really cool

517
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:51,460
picture of Carter in sunglasses on the

518
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:55,629
on the grand it looks so cool but yeah I

519
00:18:55,629 --> 00:18:57,159
know but but you chose to wear those

520
00:18:57,159 --> 00:18:59,230
cool lime green sunglasses with the red

521
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:00,879
shirt like it really kind of showed off

522
00:19:00,879 --> 00:19:03,129
what I really like the picture of the

523
00:19:03,129 --> 00:19:05,500
think like the toddler who's just like

524
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:07,360
staring at the light grid so his eyes

525
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,980
are all making he's like if you could

526
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:10,269
see his forehead in his eyes adored

527
00:19:10,269 --> 00:19:14,649
layman flickers a thing um so and then I

528
00:19:14,649 --> 00:19:17,679
built a name tag that kind of broke but

529
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:18,669
I'm still working on getting that back

530
00:19:18,669 --> 00:19:20,860
to normal and I guess I put the picture

531
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:23,440
the internet button up there too I also

532
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,509
helped run to node BOTS days in Austin

533
00:19:25,509 --> 00:19:27,850
so node BOTS days july 27th of every

534
00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:30,309
year I say I helped run I really didn't

535
00:19:30,309 --> 00:19:31,270
do all that much

536
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:32,830
ray Pearce actually did like 90 for the

537
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:34,150
loric and I just kind of like stood

538
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:36,550
there so he's the best and I had I had

539
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:37,900
to give him a shout out because I'm the

540
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:40,870
22 no BOTS days we've had 2013 we had 10

541
00:19:40,870 --> 00:19:43,690
attendees and everybody walked home with

542
00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:46,390
a spark fundamentals kit thanks to local

543
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:50,020
sponsors this year we had 30 spark

544
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:53,020
course delivered to my house one for

545
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:55,780
each attendee we did have 30 we ended up

546
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:57,460
with 35 we let five other people and

547
00:19:57,460 --> 00:20:00,580
after registration ended and then we did

548
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:02,470
the the puffle BOTS the little suma bots

549
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:05,440
and yeah 30 tenis we also had Donovan

550
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,730
buck who's doing some really cool stuff

551
00:20:06,730 --> 00:20:09,280
with hexapods come keynote from Houston

552
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,410
so the node box meeting in Austin is

553
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:13,000
thriving and growing and it's really fun

554
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,830
the scene so the things I've learned

555
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:17,020
from node BOTS day or more about

556
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:19,360
community than about node BOTS and I I

557
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,760
feel like those are inexorably linked

558
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,020
because no bots is such an amazing

559
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:25,180
community we have a code of conduct for

560
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:27,700
everything for our contributions for our

561
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:28,990
forums for everything there is a code of

562
00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:30,850
conduct to be involved in the node bot

563
00:20:30,850 --> 00:20:33,010
community and I really appreciate that

564
00:20:33,010 --> 00:20:35,410
on a level that I can't really

565
00:20:35,410 --> 00:20:37,990
articulate very well the things I

566
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:40,330
learned about community code is by no

567
00:20:40,330 --> 00:20:43,510
means the only way to contribute you

568
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:45,010
don't need a pull request to be a

569
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:46,930
contributor to a community if you have

570
00:20:46,930 --> 00:20:48,730
docs if you've helped people if you've

571
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:50,140
taught people if you've done knowed

572
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:51,790
school you've commuted you you've

573
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:54,250
contributed to the node community like

574
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:55,600
just because you don't have a pull

575
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,660
request on node core because who does

576
00:20:57,660 --> 00:21:01,900
there's 20 of them for reals and you've

577
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:03,400
still contributed to the community

578
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,650
you're right no means not a member of

579
00:21:05,650 --> 00:21:07,000
the community just because you haven't

580
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,890
contributed directly code there are many

581
00:21:08,890 --> 00:21:09,940
many ways to contribute to your

582
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:11,140
community even it was just helping out a

583
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:13,120
newbie codes of conduct are important

584
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,980
and feel free to argue this is me off

585
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:16,720
stage all you want because I'm not going

586
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:17,950
to budge codes of conduct are

587
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:21,280
extraordinarily important and the last

588
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,650
thing I learned is do not ever make

589
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:26,950
assumptions about people ever because I

590
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:28,840
learned that's the easiest way to say

591
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:31,240
something remarkably silly is to assume

592
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,710
something about a person by how they

593
00:21:32,710 --> 00:21:35,740
look or by an arbitration you might know

594
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:36,850
about them like for instance I have

595
00:21:36,850 --> 00:21:38,680
friends with various visual and hearing

596
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:40,720
impairments and if I assume they can't

597
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,190
do something without asking them first

598
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:44,410
well I easily look like ayaats most of

599
00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:45,010
the time

600
00:21:45,010 --> 00:21:46,210
so the number one thing I've learned

601
00:21:46,210 --> 00:21:47,860
about community that I think kind of

602
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:49,840
makes everything else work is don't make

603
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,580
assumptions about people regardless of

604
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:53,170
what you know about them already we just

605
00:21:53,170 --> 00:21:56,830
ask it's a lot easier and seriously we

606
00:21:56,830 --> 00:21:58,780
do have some issues with community I was

607
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:01,000
at robot conf last weekend and it got

608
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,980
out that my dad is an electrical

609
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:06,070
engineer and I had a guy come up to my

610
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:07,420
glue scene he goes oh so your dad built

611
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:10,510
these yeah right that gasp right there

612
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:13,660
really write like oh my gosh League I i

613
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:15,460
actually was silent for about three

614
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:16,600
seconds and people who know me know

615
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:20,050
that's amazing um i just kind of stared

616
00:22:20,050 --> 00:22:22,270
at him for three seconds I go excuse me

617
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:23,920
and he goes well your dad built these

618
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:26,460
right and then you kind of coded them

619
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:31,050
what you want a shovel um did and III

620
00:22:31,050 --> 00:22:34,060
apparently I I told him to just get the

621
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:35,980
hell away from my booth like I just like

622
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:39,400
told me go away um yeah that happened in

623
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:43,810
2014 I had a name tag and I wanna I'm

624
00:22:43,810 --> 00:22:45,040
gonna be honest and I haven't really

625
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:47,950
told the story I don't want to rebuild

626
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:49,960
my name tag because some guy at a party

627
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:52,150
was like now I have an excuse to stare

628
00:22:52,150 --> 00:22:53,920
at your chest because i had a color

629
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:56,920
changing name tag that was an LCD for

630
00:22:56,920 --> 00:23:01,360
real in 2014 that happen so the last

631
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,770
bullet is do i seriously need to be

632
00:23:02,770 --> 00:23:04,240
talking about this in 2014 yeah I I

633
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,070
really do because this stuff still

634
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:07,360
happens and we all need to be aware of

635
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:10,240
it I think nodebots is is easily the

636
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,400
best community I've been involved in the

637
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,740
this this is not a thing that happens to

638
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:17,530
me at all regularly with node box I've

639
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:19,150
had a couple of isolated incidents but

640
00:23:19,150 --> 00:23:21,100
when i get out into like the real world

641
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:24,070
it happens a lot more often so keeping

642
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:25,210
it you know think about what you say

643
00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:26,650
because it can really really affect

644
00:23:26,650 --> 00:23:28,060
people in ways that you you may not

645
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:31,690
understand well luckily for me my love

646
00:23:31,690 --> 00:23:34,300
for robots a node and javascript and and

647
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:37,570
the amazing people in the node and node

648
00:23:37,570 --> 00:23:40,090
bots community many of whom are sitting

649
00:23:40,090 --> 00:23:43,480
in this room right now outpaces my anger

650
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:45,100
and fear and frustration at the system i

651
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:46,390
live in i will break down and cry

652
00:23:46,390 --> 00:23:47,830
sometimes i will break down and get

653
00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:49,540
upset i will break down in few

654
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:51,370
expletives for minutes on end but

655
00:23:51,370 --> 00:23:53,680
luckily my my love of robots in the

656
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:55,810
community is going hopefully forever

657
00:23:55,810 --> 00:23:57,430
outpaced my anger and fear and

658
00:23:57,430 --> 00:23:58,600
frustration and

659
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:02,110

669
00:24:20,770 --> 00:24:22,630
suitcase of robotics I've been carrying

670
00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:24,220
all month and i'll be working on

671
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:26,200
different projects i want to see what

672
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,789
you build the community is too but like

673
00:24:27,789 --> 00:24:29,740
I specifically me and like this person

674
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:31,090
wants to see what you built I love it

675
00:24:31,090 --> 00:24:32,710
when people email me or tweet at me with

676
00:24:32,710 --> 00:24:33,669
things that they bail even if it's just

677
00:24:33,669 --> 00:24:35,799
like look I got an LED blinking I still

678
00:24:35,799 --> 00:24:37,270
want to see that it's awesome and

679
00:24:37,270 --> 00:24:38,559
amazing and it makes me happy to see it

680
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:41,890
and when you document and write about

681
00:24:41,890 --> 00:24:43,570
what you did also write about what went

682
00:24:43,570 --> 00:24:45,130
wrong because people learn so much more

683
00:24:45,130 --> 00:24:46,390
about what went wrong with your project

684
00:24:46,390 --> 00:24:49,059
I won't what right so always always own

685
00:24:49,059 --> 00:24:50,679
up well it's not good owning obviously

686
00:24:50,679 --> 00:24:52,360
