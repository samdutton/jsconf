1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:07,230

all right so first of all let's get the

2
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:10,920
sunscreen first of all I just want to

3
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:11,969
say I'm a little bit embarrassed about

4
00:00:11,969 --> 00:00:15,289
my outfit that I'm not as handsome as

5
00:00:15,289 --> 00:00:18,029
Florida over here or Vanessa in the

6
00:00:18,029 --> 00:00:20,369
other room the truth is I brought a

7
00:00:20,369 --> 00:00:22,859
really nice stylish shirt to wear today

8
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:25,289
but my hotel room didn't have an iron I

9
00:00:25,289 --> 00:00:26,730
called him at seven in the morning and

10
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:28,560
they took way too long to bring it up so

11
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,449
I just thought like you know I was

12
00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:32,640
actually panicking this morning called

13
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,170
my boyfriend and I was like I don't have

14
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:35,460
anything else to wear just the trekking

15
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:36,989
gear for this weekend and like maybe

16
00:00:36,989 --> 00:00:38,129
I'll just go onstage and look like a

17
00:00:38,129 --> 00:00:41,070
mountaineer so he was like it's okay

18
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:42,510
it's a Developer Conference and I was

19
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:44,430
like that's right I'm gonna just be

20
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:45,930
myself and be comfortable and be really

21
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:48,239
cozy like a mountaineer talking about

22
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:51,329
augmented reality so let me just

23
00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:52,949
introduce myself my name is race' and

24
00:00:52,949 --> 00:00:55,559
I'm a creative engineer at Google my

25
00:00:55,559 --> 00:00:58,109
team one day was looking for ways to use

26
00:00:58,109 --> 00:00:59,550
augmented reality in one of our

27
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:01,649
marketing campaigns so I took the

28
00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:03,510
liberty of just doing the research on my

29
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:06,210
own seeing what's possible and naturally

30
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:07,710
I just started digging out into the

31
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:10,460
history got really excited about the

32
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:12,570
many many years that it has gone back

33
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:15,119
and wanted to share with my team to help

34
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:17,130
them appreciate what it is today and of

35
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:19,259
course do my actual job of reporting

36
00:01:19,259 --> 00:01:20,820
back what's possible today and in the

37
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:30,950
future so what is possible in the future

38
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:33,450
actually and before I start I want to

39
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:35,189
just make a really quick disclaimer that

40
00:01:35,189 --> 00:01:37,619
I'm all this research all this research

41
00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:39,570
I did was on my own it's all public

42
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:41,850
knowledge and with that being said I'm

43
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:43,710
speaking on behalf of myself and not on

44
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:45,329
behalf of my company or any of the

45
00:01:45,329 --> 00:01:48,479
organizations I'm a part of so let's

46
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:50,159
step back into history all the way back

47
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:52,979
into 1901 this was a time before

48
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:55,950
airplanes before traditional color

49
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:58,649
photography that we know and nearly a

50
00:01:58,649 --> 00:02:00,509
decade before the world's the first

51
00:02:00,509 --> 00:02:03,719
talking motion picture yet before all of

52
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:05,939
these technological advancements we had

53
00:02:05,939 --> 00:02:07,890
a visionary author called L frank Baum

54
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:11,009
who you see up here and he envisioned a

55
00:02:11,009 --> 00:02:13,770
world in a novel that he wrote called

56
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:15,840
master key he wrote about a world where

57
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,520
one could put on a pair of spectacles

58
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,390
and the people that he would look at it

59
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:22,710
would overlay a character over their

60
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:24,870
head and this this device was called a

61
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:26,280
character marker so basically he's

62
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,680
looking around and can judge a person on

63
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,780
a single look so this was these were

64
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:33,090
some really deep sci-fi thoughts back in

65
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:36,150
1901 such like I can't even imagine how

66
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:38,430
he could have came up with this idea and

67
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:39,810
if the name rings a bell he's author of

68
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:42,060
The Wizard of Oz so maybe it's not so

69
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:45,240
surprising after all then fast forward

70
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:49,290
to 1968 we a lot has happened in this

71
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:52,080
time America has built the first 747

72
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,200
we've orbited the moon from Apollo 8 and

73
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,840
at the same time we have the world's

74
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,960
first head mounted display this was

75
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,760
developed by of Harvard professor called

76
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:05,970
Ivan Sutherland and this display that

77
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:07,650
you see here it was so heavy it has to

78
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:09,720
be mounted from the ceiling and there's

79
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:10,770
this funny video on YouTube where you

80
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:12,090
can see him like spinning around and all

81
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:14,010
he's seeing is this really simple wire

82
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:16,950
cube so after all this hard work you saw

83
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:20,250
this visionary cube in space and this

84
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:22,050
was a really important precursor to a

85
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:24,390
art because as you'll see there's been

86
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:26,100
so many advancements with head mounted

87
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:29,850
displays these days and now looking at

88
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:34,020
2018 we have the rocket orbiting into

89
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:36,209
space with the car that's now somewhere

90
00:03:36,209 --> 00:03:39,510
out there floating but at the same time

91
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:41,610
we also have all of these advancements

92
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:43,709
in augmented reality everyone is talking

93
00:03:43,709 --> 00:03:45,720
about when it's going to be the next big

94
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,959
thing for the past few years

95
00:03:47,959 --> 00:03:50,130
technologists and investors alike or

96
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:51,480
speculating on when this is going to

97
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:54,060
really blow up so what is happening

98
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:55,650
after all of these years you see that

99
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:58,530
there's rich history of over a century

100
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:01,800
ago that dates back on mentioned reality

101
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:06,150
since at least 1901 so if you look at

102
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:09,270
this chart from Google Trends in case

103
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:11,700
you haven't used it before the y-axis is

104
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:14,400
the search interest from 0 to 100 and on

105
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,830
the x-axis we have time so I'm I did a

106
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:19,320
search back until the past two and a

107
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,209
half years to see how interested people

108
00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:23,490
were in augmented reality and as you can

109
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:25,590
see there's some interesting activity

110
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:26,930
going on here

111
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:31,009
suddenly in the summer of 2016 we see a

112
00:04:31,009 --> 00:04:32,780
huge peak and people are curious about

113
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:35,600
this mysterious AR thing that they've

114
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,330
just sort of and this is when Pokemon go

115
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:41,180
is released so all of a sudden we have

116
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:42,740
people using this cool new app and

117
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:44,419
wondering like whoa what is augmented

118
00:04:44,419 --> 00:04:46,850
reality and I want what else is possible

119
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:49,580
with this thing this opened up this was

120
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:53,750
probably the most popular AR application

121
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:56,449
although as we'll see it's not fully AR

122
00:04:56,449 --> 00:04:58,759
capable and they're working on that

123
00:04:58,759 --> 00:05:02,270
application fully AR pokemon go soon but

124
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:04,430
this really opened people consumers eyes

125
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:07,490
into the possibilities of AR and really

126
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:11,330
showed the potential for its scale then

127
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:14,000
later in more recent years around the

128
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,419
fall of 2017 we have another peak that's

129
00:05:17,419 --> 00:05:19,190
starting to rise and although it's not

130
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:22,580
as high as pokemon go this was from AR

131
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:24,229
core and era kit which were announced

132
00:05:24,229 --> 00:05:26,030
roughly around the same time and these

133
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:27,590
are developer kits that will allow

134
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:30,949
people to build experiences such as

135
00:05:30,949 --> 00:05:34,240
Pokemon go and much easier and much more

136
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:38,180
streamlined way so it's a quick

137
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:40,340
definition air core is a platform for

138
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,500
building augmented reality apps on

139
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:45,620
Android and AR kit is Apple's version

140
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:51,500
for building AR apps on iOS looking back

141
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:52,940
a few more years this is as far back as

142
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:55,580
you can go on Google Trends from 2004

143
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:57,169
you see that there's actually some

144
00:05:57,169 --> 00:05:59,960
activity going on people are actually

145
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:02,210
interested and aware of augmented

146
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:04,970
reality especially around 2009 so that

147
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:07,550
was almost 10 years ago and why does it

148
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:09,979
seem like it's such a new thing now this

149
00:06:09,979 --> 00:06:12,080
is when AR tool kit was released for web

150
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,830
it's an open-source toolkit I guess if

151
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:17,570
you want to compare it to AR core and AR

152
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:20,440
kit this allowed developers to build

153
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:25,639
web-based applications so this was

154
00:06:25,639 --> 00:06:27,979
actually the output would be flash based

155
00:06:27,979 --> 00:06:29,960
so this is one of the reasons why it

156
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:32,150
didn't really take on because users have

157
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:34,520
to install a plug-in and then they kind

158
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,320
of have to like use their webcam in a

159
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:38,830
weird way that it doesn't feel natural

160
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:40,820
compared to a mobile device

161
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:42,440
where you can take it around with you

162
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:44,270
and it makes more sense to like kind of

163
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:47,030
point at what you want to project your

164
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:51,500
AR object onto so this really shows it

165
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,780
state the documentation of AR toolkit or

166
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:56,930
this publication about it describes what

167
00:06:56,930 --> 00:07:01,010
AR toolkit is it shows a our toolkit in

168
00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:02,930
action and as you can see it's marker

169
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:06,440
based so they have this code where it

170
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:09,440
will project the the object from the

171
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:12,050
code and then in the documentation you

172
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:15,050
can also see that it's using Windows XP

173
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:16,670
and telling you how to use a webcam on

174
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:21,230
your computer then later in 2009 we have

175
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:22,880
the introduction of augmented reality

176
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,710
into the real world so Esquire post

177
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:30,380
Esquire published this issue it was an

178
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:32,150
augmented reality special and on the

179
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:34,100
front cover you had this QR code that

180
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:36,230
you could scan and then something

181
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:39,290
magical happens Robert Downey Downey jr.

182
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:41,260
comes out of the screen and starts like

183
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:43,760
acknowledging you and then there was

184
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,320
also as you saw in the previous screen

185
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:47,360
there's there were 12 pages of a our

186
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,090
content and lots of publications we're

187
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:52,090
talking about it and it was really

188
00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:56,480
becoming more noticeable to consumers so

189
00:07:56,480 --> 00:08:00,050
fast forwarding to today we have back in

190
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:03,650
2012 Google Hangouts filters which is

191
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:05,420
actually long before snapchat which many

192
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:08,090
people don't know snapchats world lenses

193
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:09,820
we have a huge advancement of

194
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:13,340
head-mounted displays like the microsoft

195
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:16,210
hololens and then of course pokemon goes

196
00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:19,870
very well known and the IKEA went of

197
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:23,840
Ikea like he is a furniture app from

198
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:27,170
Apple's Apple Store so what's making

199
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:28,790
this possible today is that we have much

200
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:31,160
more powerful devices much more powerful

201
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,719
browsers that will hopefully soon be

202
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:35,479
capable of a our developers are more

203
00:08:35,479 --> 00:08:37,580
well equipped with toolkits like AR core

204
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:40,039
and air kit and hopefully future support

205
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:42,289
on the web will help to bring this

206
00:08:42,289 --> 00:08:45,590
technology to the masses so let's go

207
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:47,990
back to basis and basics and talk about

208
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:53,140
what defines augmented reality apps

209
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:55,640
so air Corrigan is the software

210
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:57,700
developer kit that allows developers to

211
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:01,460
use these defining air features in AR in

212
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:03,830
Android applications and these defining

213
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:06,440
features include motion tracking which

214
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:08,150
allows the device to understand and

215
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:09,680
track its position relative to the real

216
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,290
world so a scare coat you can place into

217
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:14,180
the world and move around and it looks

218
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:15,529
like it's stationary just like these

219
00:09:15,529 --> 00:09:18,410
people next to it and environmental

220
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:20,779
understanding so that the device can

221
00:09:20,779 --> 00:09:22,510
detect the size and location of

222
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:24,470
previously it was only horizontal

223
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:26,660
surfaces but now with the release of AR

224
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:29,750
core 1.0 you can also place it on

225
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:31,130
textured surfaces and there was this

226
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:34,339
cool demo of placing things on the snow

227
00:09:34,339 --> 00:09:37,690
like around the tree it's pretty cool

228
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:40,010
and then lighten estimation which allows

229
00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:41,630
the device to estimate the lighting

230
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:43,600
conditions and this really helps bring

231
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,529
objects to life because even the

232
00:09:45,529 --> 00:09:48,230
subtleties like shadows and brightness

233
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:52,130
can really make an object in in the real

234
00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:58,250
world look real so previously we have we

235
00:09:58,250 --> 00:09:59,900
had a platformer called tango which

236
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:01,850
allowed augmented reality on these

237
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:05,270
really powerful devices but as these

238
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:07,160
were very specialized we decided we

239
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:08,660
wanted to bring this to the masses and

240
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:11,140
that's when we really focus our efforts

241
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:14,839
from late last year on a our core which

242
00:10:14,839 --> 00:10:17,360
will make it make augmented reality

243
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,779
possible on more Android devices so that

244
00:10:20,779 --> 00:10:22,700
is a huge challenge but also a really

245
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:24,320
big opportunity the fact that there are

246
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,600
two billion plus active devices out

247
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,970
there running on Android and each of

248
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:32,110
these has their own unique hardware

249
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:34,790
requirements and hardware specs that we

250
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:37,370
have to make sure align and provide the

251
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:38,959
same high quality experience that we

252
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:41,839
want all users to have so currently with

253
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:43,640
the most recent release it works on 100

254
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:45,560
million devices which includes 13 unique

255
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:47,240
models that you see here and we're

256
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:49,270
working with partners to make sure that

257
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:54,170
more devices can support this and going

258
00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:56,540
back to AR kits this is a software

259
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:58,940
developer kit allowing developers to use

260
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:01,970
the same essential features in iOS 11

261
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:04,040
the way to describe it it's it's very

262
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:07,010
similar to the three basic

263
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:10,940
features that that Eric or suggest those

264
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:13,880
are basically essential AR features not

265
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:17,170
AR core like there there's they can be

266
00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:20,180
described for any element to the reality

267
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:24,320
out and their device compatibility is

268
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:27,410
all most recent Apple devices so with a

269
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:29,960
nine plus a nine chip we're above

270
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:32,390
running iOS 11 and up so that includes

271
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:35,180
iPhone 6s setup and some of the newer

272
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:39,170
iPads so let's talk about building for

273
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:41,630
web because all of this air core and air

274
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:43,370
kit allows you to build native apps but

275
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:45,080
this is a j/s conference so you guys are

276
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:47,030
probably bored thinking about building

277
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:50,480
an F we want to build for web so let's

278
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:54,410
see what's possible air core currently

279
00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:57,010
has an experiment where they're

280
00:11:57,010 --> 00:11:59,930
exploring the possibilities of web

281
00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:01,250
support which would be awesome because

282
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:02,900
it will lower the barrier to entry and

283
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:05,240
people can build apps and release them

284
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:09,530
to out to the web so this is like a pre

285
00:12:09,530 --> 00:12:11,870
standards experimentation just trying to

286
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:13,670
see what's explore what's possible and

287
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:16,430
it's basically a wrapper of chromium and

288
00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:18,520
it's extending web VR features so that

289
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:22,580
it's really scalable and allows for

290
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:26,240
fallbacks and across multiple devices so

291
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,040
they have this cool demo called article

292
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,990
which you can download on github

293
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:31,550
just npm install all the dependencies

294
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:34,610
and run it on the web pack server and

295
00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:39,710
it's super easy and just to explain air

296
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:41,690
core for web is not one single entity

297
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:43,940
it's basically you're building a web app

298
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:48,020
with a our capabilities you're using JSI

299
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:50,420
Ares to build the 3d objects and then

300
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:52,430
you are running it on this experimental

301
00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:54,020
browser that's supposed to emulate what

302
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:55,460
the web standards might look like and

303
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:57,410
currently they have experimental

304
00:12:57,410 --> 00:12:59,210
browsers that work on both Android and

305
00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:01,910
iOS so they're called err where they are

306
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:03,860
on air core and web a are on air kit

307
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:10,760
respectively and most of the examples on

308
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:14,420
the web a are for air core demos are

309
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:16,490
built with three Jas it's a really

310
00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:18,890
popular 3d modeling library that's been

311
00:13:18,890 --> 00:13:20,540
used since 2010

312
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:22,670
some of Google's projects have used it

313
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:25,070
including the poly library this

314
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:27,320
educational experience experience called

315
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,680
inter land and all of these other cool

316
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:32,180
Google and on Google experiments that

317
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:34,760
you see here and it allows you to create

318
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:37,610
3d shapes animations complex scenes and

319
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:39,650
gives you some tools to make this a lot

320
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:41,930
easier for you because as you'll find 3d

321
00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:45,080
modeling concepts are really hard so

322
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,100
this is one of the tools that it

323
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:48,980
provides it's an in-browser kind of

324
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:53,090
shape editor or scene editor and it

325
00:13:53,090 --> 00:13:54,110
allows you to control all these

326
00:13:54,110 --> 00:13:56,930
different parameters and it's a really

327
00:13:56,930 --> 00:13:59,930
good way to kind of start learning 3d

328
00:13:59,930 --> 00:14:01,280
modeling and especially if you haven't

329
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,930
been paying attention in math class like

330
00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:05,030
I did you have to relearn kind of UV

331
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:07,580
mapping and vectors and matrix

332
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:09,680
multiplication and it really sometimes

333
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,290
it's a little bit overwhelming but with

334
00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:13,790
tools like this it becomes a lot easier

335
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:16,520
and if you get good you can make some

336
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:20,330
crazy 3d shapes like this but if you are

337
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:22,370
having trouble with 3d modeling you can

338
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:25,810
also download some models on poly and

339
00:14:25,810 --> 00:14:27,740
find all these different kinds of

340
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:31,010
cheeseburgers anything like just

341
00:14:31,010 --> 00:14:32,300
basically search for the term and you'll

342
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:33,620
find different items that are tagged

343
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:36,770
with that description and if you really

344
00:14:36,770 --> 00:14:38,060
like these cheeseburgers you can just

345
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:40,400
put it all together start throwing them

346
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,000
in the air

347
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:46,810
and then that's your AR app so just to

348
00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:49,250
just to highlight what's possible with

349
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:51,740
three days this is one of the apps that

350
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:53,570
my team has built called Qibla finder

351
00:14:53,570 --> 00:14:55,550
and it helps people find the direction

352
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:57,920
of Qibla which is the direction of

353
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:01,460
prayer during Ramadan and basically we

354
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:03,620
use three J s but they are core and AIRC

355
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:05,390
it were not yet available and this was

356
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:07,580
also a web app so we kind of had to get

357
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:10,160
creative and this is basically just

358
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:15,700
using WebRTC to use the camera and

359
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:19,550
navigation api's and basically it's

360
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:22,280
projecting this into space rather than

361
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:25,130
as we've learned as an essential AR

362
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:27,680
feature it doesn't allow you to kind of

363
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:30,350
place it onto a detected surface so it's

364
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:33,670
it's a kind of like faux AR but it

365
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:35,800
um I guess you can compare it to

366
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,270
pokemons go where you're not really

367
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:39,640
placing the you're not really throwing

368
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:43,750
the pokeball onto the the Pokemon that's

369
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:45,400
it's not on the floor it's kind of just

370
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,680
like sometimes it's floating around so

371
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,510
that's kind of one distinction of what's

372
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:52,600
possible with three J s and how we need

373
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:55,300
to bridge the gap so to bridge those

374
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:58,300
gaps there is a library called three rjs

375
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:00,730
which kind of detects the device

376
00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:04,090
compatibility and enables the AR Web

377
00:16:04,090 --> 00:16:06,610
utilities by interfacing with the web VR

378
00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:09,550
extension that is exposed by the

379
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:11,560
experimental browsers so that's what's

380
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:13,570
allowing you to throw things onto

381
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:18,040
surfaces and detect it with precision so

382
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:19,390
putting it all together you can create

383
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:21,340
some really useful apps like for example

384
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:24,940
this living room modeling there's some

385
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:26,950
really useful things you can do for

386
00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:28,510
consumers to make this really widely

387
00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:30,040
adopted and especially if it's available

388
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:32,920
for the web then people can just reach

389
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:35,590
these experiment experiences from a link

390
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:37,960
and access them if their device is

391
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:43,030
compatible so again the web AR on-air

392
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:44,800
core implementation is just an

393
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,330
exploration right now to explore what's

394
00:16:46,330 --> 00:16:49,180
possible and what might be potential web

395
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:51,130
standards but there are also a lot more

396
00:16:51,130 --> 00:16:53,800
web implementations for example Mozilla

397
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,930
has their web X our standards proposal

398
00:16:55,930 --> 00:16:57,910
which there's a lot of commonalities

399
00:16:57,910 --> 00:17:00,520
between the different pre standards

400
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,230
proposals right now so that's a good

401
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:04,390
sign that things are starting to align

402
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:05,830
and hopefully we have some standards

403
00:17:05,830 --> 00:17:08,320
soon there's also the Argonne browser

404
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:11,050
and Argonne jeaious and I think one of

405
00:17:11,050 --> 00:17:12,820
the most popular ones might be the

406
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:16,180
marker based a rjs and if you recognize

407
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:18,640
the markers from my earlier slides it's

408
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,590
because it's based on a our tool kit so

409
00:17:20,590 --> 00:17:25,630
it goes way back so with all of these

410
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:27,370
standards that are not really fully in

411
00:17:27,370 --> 00:17:29,380
place why should we care about it now

412
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:31,450
like what if it changes and stressing

413
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:32,920
you guys out to learn all these new

414
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:36,940
things but as you know with 3d modeling

415
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:39,010
it's it's a really big concept to grasp

416
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:40,480
and if you start learning it now like

417
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,400
there's a lot to catch up on people are

418
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,260
already using 3GS and have been 3d

419
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:46,270
modeling for decades so it's really good

420
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:47,530
if you're interested in it now and

421
00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:49,450
you should start equipping yourself with

422
00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:51,340
the basic knowledge to get started and

423
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:53,260
people are already building really cool

424
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:54,180
stuff right now

425
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:58,210
so some sources of inspiration there's

426
00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:01,600
some AR core specific examples on this

427
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,090
is AR core calm there's also an AR kit

428
00:18:04,090 --> 00:18:06,100
version at the bottom there and one of

429
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:08,790
my personal favorites is this one from

430
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:12,040
Jericho / AR experiments which just

431
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:14,530
features some of Google's I mean not

432
00:18:14,530 --> 00:18:16,270
biased or anything but some of Google's

433
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:18,490
AR experiments but one of the reasons

434
00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:20,380
why I love it so much is that half of

435
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:22,540
the experiments on there were created by

436
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:24,370
women so that's really awesome to show

437
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:26,410
that representation in the web XR

438
00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:30,580
community and going back to Ivan

439
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:32,530
Sutherland the Harvard professor who

440
00:18:32,530 --> 00:18:34,300
created the first headband to display

441
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:35,950
he said that the screen is a window

442
00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:37,510
through which one sees a virtual world

443
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:39,550
and the challenge is to make that world

444
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:42,280
look real act real sound real and feel

445
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:44,650
real so with all these technological

446
00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:46,960
advancements in the past century or so I

447
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,100
think we're we're getting really close

448
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:51,910
to that and although we might not be

449
00:18:51,910 --> 00:18:54,550
close to these know really complex head

450
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:56,800
not to displays I can control an armored

451
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,360
suit or anything I think it's really

452
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:00,190
exciting that we can we're getting

453
00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:02,530
really close to building web-based AR

454
00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:04,270
applications because that's is what's

455
00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:05,950
really gonna make AR become more

456
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:08,080
widespread so thank you guys for

457
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:13,580
listening
