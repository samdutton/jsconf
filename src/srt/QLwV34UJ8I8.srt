00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,929

hey everybody I'm fought a wolf before

2
00:00:03,929 --> 00:00:06,000
we get started this is all this is

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,940
pretty similar to my absolute last slide

4
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:11,370
with all this info so yeah get out your

5
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:13,320
cameras or really quickly type the notes

6
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:15,540
if you write down nothing else just get

7
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:18,750
that top link which is bit dot Lee slash

8
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:23,460
Fatih - Cascadia je s - 2018

9
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:25,890
that's bit dot Lee slash Fatih -

10
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:29,550
Cascadia je s - 2018 that's all these

11
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:34,410
slides sans that one link in PDF format

12
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:36,960
if you want to follow along alright I

13
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,790
want to do I do that because I noticed

14
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:40,500
we're all speaking really fast because

15
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,420
we're trying to cram everything we can

16
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:45,660
into 25 minutes I will try and do the

17
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:48,329
same all right so my talk is called

18
00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:51,870
teaching decided to touch and feel a bit

19
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:55,170
more or a bit more empathy the react

20
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:57,960
native Braille 6 key input NPM package

21
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:01,320
that our team at the circus Inc created

22
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:04,979
for PSU Department called Universal

23
00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:08,400
Design lab and for an app they want to

24
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,790
create it called unify ueb prep which a

25
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:14,159
ue b stands for unified english braille

26
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:16,350
which I'll get into and that's a picture

27
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:19,320
of the package in action right up there

28
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:23,580
in the top center so about me my name is

29
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:27,330
Fatih wolf that is my legal name I'm a

30
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:30,079
web and mobile app developer in

31
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:33,840
JavaScript at the circus Inc that's the

32
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,240
circus comm in Portland Oregon

33
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,280
that's the polish spelling by the way

34
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,829
because the owners of our building are a

35
00:01:40,829 --> 00:01:42,600
Polish descent and they call the

36
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,939
building circ so we're the circus and I

37
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:46,649
ran away and joined the circus

38
00:01:46,649 --> 00:01:52,290
and I am a totally stable genius if any

39
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:54,540
of you have a problem with my saying

40
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:57,149
that I would just say I'm as much of a

41
00:01:57,149 --> 00:01:59,640
totally stable genius as anyone else who

42
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,409
feels the need to constantly claim that

43
00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:05,790
they're a totally stable genius however

44
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:08,879
I'm not necessarily a react native or

45
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:12,120
NPM genius I had played a bit with react

46
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:12,900
native and I

47
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:15,780
some react stuff prior to joining the

48
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:17,580
circus I love that sing I joined the

49
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:21,629
circus and I knew I've known an npn I

50
00:02:21,629 --> 00:02:23,819
done some express stuff and such and I

51
00:02:23,819 --> 00:02:25,980
downloaded and used NPM packages great

52
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:28,980
but I'd never done an NPM package myself

53
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:31,680
before these are all the ways you can

54
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,579
get in touch with me and a bit about me

55
00:02:35,579 --> 00:02:38,370
I tend to be on my off hours a streaming

56
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:40,849
binge junkie that's why the picture of

57
00:02:40,849 --> 00:02:43,590
the doctor Jodie Whittaker up is up

58
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:46,950
there I am Brad Baker I have my own

59
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:48,870
sourdough starter home I bake bread with

60
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:51,269
oh I thinking I need to feed that

61
00:02:51,269 --> 00:02:54,390
starter and I'm a bicyclist that bottom

62
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:56,400
thing is me at the end of the Seattle to

63
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,579
Portland ride three years ago and I am a

64
00:02:59,579 --> 00:03:03,720
beer snob no PBR for me thank you so

65
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,849
before we get into the main part of the

66
00:03:05,849 --> 00:03:07,859
talk I want to ask you guys to

67
00:03:07,859 --> 00:03:09,870
participate in a little experiment with

68
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:13,109
me you don't have to participate folks

69
00:03:13,109 --> 00:03:17,099
if you don't want to but if you do I'm

70
00:03:17,099 --> 00:03:19,380
going to ask you to get out your smart

71
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:22,410
device be it a iPhone or Android or a

72
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:25,139
tablet or an iPad or whatever and I'm

73
00:03:25,139 --> 00:03:28,590
going to ask you to lock the screen so

74
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:32,720
it goes blank and then close your eyes

75
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:36,739
with your eyes closed just by touch

76
00:03:36,739 --> 00:03:39,840
unlock the screen now if you have one of

77
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,819
those fingerprint sensors that should be

78
00:03:41,819 --> 00:03:45,480
easy if you've got like the modern it

79
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:49,019
checks your face you can just turn it

80
00:03:49,019 --> 00:03:50,370
toward your face with your eyes closed

81
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:53,160
if you want then once you think you have

82
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:55,889
it open try and do a simple task open a

83
00:03:55,889 --> 00:03:58,650
message an SMS message and try to start

84
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:02,419
typing in an SMS message or a notepad or

85
00:04:02,419 --> 00:04:05,160
open your mail find the icon that opens

86
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:08,129
your mail and begin to try and touch and

87
00:04:08,129 --> 00:04:12,660
see where messages are how's that going

88
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:14,150
for everybody

89
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:17,750
I thought so so what's this all about

90
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:19,729
I'm here to describe to you a new NPM

91
00:04:19,729 --> 00:04:22,009
package for react native that we made

92
00:04:22,009 --> 00:04:23,840
because we created the app and react

93
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,810
native it for a keyboard for Braille six

94
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:29,930
key input I'm going to talk about how we

95
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:32,240
get got here or why we created this in

96
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,550
particular I'm going to talk about the

97
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:37,310
road to getting there which is as Sir

98
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:39,410
Paul said a long and winding road many

99
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:41,780
twists and turns and now with even more

100
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:44,210
crushing to fit defeats yet triumphant

101
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:46,430
via victories and I'm also going to talk

102
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:48,020
about the future of it and how you folks

103
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:50,240
can contribute to this open source NPM

104
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,800
package before I go any further

105
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:56,630
Marcy mentioned accessibility and I'm

106
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:58,850
very much especially since working on

107
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:00,949
this before this me and knowing

108
00:05:00,949 --> 00:05:04,789
accessibility and Al Evan why not much

109
00:05:04,789 --> 00:05:06,680
and in fact I haven't worked very much

110
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,810
on that part of this product that we're

111
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:11,599
working on and so it when people said

112
00:05:11,599 --> 00:05:13,360
well as you're talking to me about

113
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,949
accessibility in a 11y my first reaction

114
00:05:15,949 --> 00:05:19,970
was to go no because I just didn't know

115
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:20,870
that much about it

116
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:22,789
except there has been a person he's an

117
00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:26,539
intern working on that part on the app

118
00:05:26,539 --> 00:05:29,320
and I will talk about it a bit later

119
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:32,449
also I didn't want to talk about it much

120
00:05:32,449 --> 00:05:34,159
because it's kind of known that react

121
00:05:34,159 --> 00:05:37,130
native is very what or used to be very

122
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:40,099
limited in how it handled accessibility

123
00:05:40,099 --> 00:05:43,550
in a 11y it was extremely limited and

124
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:46,580
people weren't happy about it but then I

125
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:48,830
I did a little bit more searching I

126
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:50,180
thought well maybe we can incorporate

127
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:53,539
some of that in here I wanted to call

128
00:05:53,539 --> 00:05:55,130
everyone's attention to an article I

129
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:57,740
recently read it's on LinkedIn it's

130
00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:01,520
written by a MS Zeki Chen she's a

131
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,260
computer science and business major at

132
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:06,680
UC Berkeley and for a few months she was

133
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:09,050
an intern at Facebook working on react

134
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:11,210
native particularly on the accessibility

135
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:14,810
API for react native and she talks about

136
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:16,789
in this that's the link to the article

137
00:06:16,789 --> 00:06:19,490
right up there so feel free to look it

138
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:21,470
up it's a very good article she talks

139
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:23,659
about what the original limitations were

140
00:06:23,659 --> 00:06:26,090
that people were complaining about she

141
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:27,000
talked about the

142
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,130
sighing decisions when she was an intern

143
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:30,570
that the team made and how they

144
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:32,460
implemented them and how you can begin

145
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:34,530
to use them now so I highly recommend

146
00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:36,510
this article and I think we're gonna be

147
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:38,580
going over it and implementing a lot

148
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:44,040
into our app so how did we get here well

149
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:47,310
first before I ran off and joined the

150
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:52,550
circus as I said mid 2017 to late 2017

151
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:55,740
dr. Samuelson OTT and dr. Holly Lawson

152
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:58,770
their PhDs at Portland State University

153
00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:03,000
they Sam runs the universal design lab

154
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,220
that's the links for all that and they

155
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:09,810
wanted to create an app to help families

156
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:13,020
and allies and friends of people who are

157
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:15,930
sight impaired learn Braille right at

158
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:18,930
least beginning that was what our goal

159
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:21,120
was with this app and this is the little

160
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,220
website that we created for them that

161
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:24,930
last link on the last slide goes to this

162
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:27,870
site is sort of announcing the app hope

163
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:31,560
we've got Sam has gotten his enterprise

164
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:35,100
accounts for Google Play and iOS now and

165
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:36,360
as soon as he gets the marketing

166
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,400
materials this app should be released on

167
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,520
the App Store's in the next few weeks

168
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:42,990
and so we were going to create this app

169
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:44,940
for them and this was created based on

170
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:47,850
mock-ups by the owner of our agency Juan

171
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:50,430
Fernandez he's a amazing graphic artist

172
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:54,000
and he and so we were going to begin

173
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,100
work on this and then I was hired in

174
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:59,880
February of this year 2018 to do some

175
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,130
web work with them but mostly to really

176
00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:04,760
laser focus on this react native app for

177
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:11,580
PSU so of course I was just getting my

178
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:15,360
feet wet in react native and such so I

179
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,630
couldn't do this alone that's my CTO and

180
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:21,000
boss and he's also a co-owner and senior

181
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,610
partner at the circus that's Ryan

182
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:26,370
Anderson I hope next year in the next

183
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:28,050
couple of years he does a call for a

184
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:29,610
proposal here because the guy's a

185
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:32,789
freaking genius he really is I rely on

186
00:08:32,789 --> 00:08:35,990
him for so much and I really admire him

187
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:38,640
also that's the intern I was talking

188
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,169
about from PSU

189
00:08:40,169 --> 00:08:43,349
dr. Senate Sam he he found him he's a

190
00:08:43,349 --> 00:08:46,170
computer science major PSU and he's

191
00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:48,209
helping us and he's the one who began to

192
00:08:48,209 --> 00:08:50,130
incorporate a lot of the accessibility

193
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:52,250
so some of the commands within the app

194
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:55,950
could be spoken and then there's me

195
00:08:55,950 --> 00:09:00,060
working diligently every day in on the

196
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:03,269
app so what were some of the

197
00:09:03,269 --> 00:09:05,100
requirements of this app well it needed

198
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:07,980
to run on smartphones and tablets on

199
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:11,550
Apple iOS and Google Android now I'm

200
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:13,350
running out of everywhere on you know

201
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:15,120
tablets iPads everywhere

202
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,570
send so of course Ryan the CTO and the

203
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:20,160
rest of the screen well let's do react

204
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,430
native it right once runs on both iOS

205
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:29,490
and Android forever right right we'll

206
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:32,339
talk more about that in a minute it

207
00:09:32,339 --> 00:09:34,589
needs to be responsive on all sizes of

208
00:09:34,589 --> 00:09:36,810
screens and phones and tablets it needs

209
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:39,750
to have interactive exercises that can

210
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:42,300
be logged and people get awards or the

211
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:46,079
the admin on the backend can see what

212
00:09:46,079 --> 00:09:48,209
exercises and courses people have

213
00:09:48,209 --> 00:09:50,459
completed and that included a keyboard

214
00:09:50,459 --> 00:09:53,910
to input six dot Braille characters

215
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:56,220
which is what you see in the universal

216
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:58,199
English Braille there have been two

217
00:09:58,199 --> 00:09:59,699
grades of that by the way there's been

218
00:09:59,699 --> 00:10:02,820
grade one and now we're on grade two of

219
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:07,170
ueb the Braille input should not cover

220
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:10,320
over parts of the screen in the app with

221
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,120
which the user is tried interact just

222
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,800
like when you bring up a keyboard in

223
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,510
notepad as you'll see me do in a moment

224
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:17,820
it should not cover the whole screen you

225
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:19,019
should be able to see what you're typing

226
00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:22,500
and you should be able to touch all the

227
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:25,579
buttons in the Braille cell at once and

228
00:10:25,579 --> 00:10:28,410
make any Braille character in the six

229
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:30,569
dots that is possible using multi-touch

230
00:10:30,569 --> 00:10:32,550
and it should all be a seamless

231
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:37,260
experience right and I know some of you

232
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:39,810
who know accessibility and a11y much

233
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:42,839
better than I are going wait fada does

234
00:10:42,839 --> 00:10:45,389
an apple iOS and Google Android have

235
00:10:45,389 --> 00:10:48,300
similar accessibility controls for the

236
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:49,610
site impaired

237
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:52,560
well yeah

238
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,810
Google Android has this thing called

239
00:10:54,810 --> 00:10:57,149
Braille back it's not part of the OS

240
00:10:57,149 --> 00:10:58,709
it's a separate free app you can

241
00:10:58,709 --> 00:11:02,730
download and the problem with that is it

242
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:05,279
expects you to have your own external

243
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:07,800
Braille keyboard they make these

244
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,589
accessibility keyboards for people who

245
00:11:10,589 --> 00:11:11,999
are cycling pared who want to type

246
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:14,249
Braille maybe you've seen some people

247
00:11:14,249 --> 00:11:18,089
use them I will say they are kind of

248
00:11:18,089 --> 00:11:21,839
expensive Android also has a thing

249
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:24,029
called G board which is their

250
00:11:24,029 --> 00:11:26,189
internationalization the ability to type

251
00:11:26,189 --> 00:11:29,040
in many different languages using the

252
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:33,540
Android G board and someone in a forearm

253
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:36,360
or in some Stack Overflow post I read

254
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,459
said and it can do Braille I said really

255
00:11:38,459 --> 00:11:39,809
and I started going through and looking

256
00:11:39,809 --> 00:11:41,550
up everything I could find Google

257
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:44,189
searches and Stack Overflow about G

258
00:11:44,189 --> 00:11:46,709
board and I could not find a Braille

259
00:11:46,709 --> 00:11:49,709
library for it I could be wrong I don't

260
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:52,050
I'm a fully admit that I don't know that

261
00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:54,600
much about it so if someone knows if

262
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,970
there's an ability to do Braille through

263
00:11:56,970 --> 00:12:00,509
G board please let me know Apple iOS

264
00:12:00,509 --> 00:12:03,389
it's built baked into the system with

265
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:05,220
the accessibility controls through the

266
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:08,029
general control panel and with voiceover

267
00:12:08,029 --> 00:12:10,529
so I'm going to give you an example of

268
00:12:10,529 --> 00:12:13,680
this now I'm gonna unplug here and plug

269
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,209
this into my phone so you'll see my

270
00:12:15,209 --> 00:12:16,980
phone screen they're gonna need to turn

271
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:18,809
this off for a second so because I don't

272
00:12:18,809 --> 00:12:20,790
want to cause seizures in the audience

273
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:24,240
from the screen flashing alright and let

274
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:27,149
me get to the app I want so I haven't

275
00:12:27,149 --> 00:12:29,939
set up I I haven't set it up already so

276
00:12:29,939 --> 00:12:33,360
three clicks on the power button brings

277
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:36,689
up voiceover and then using the rotor

278
00:12:36,689 --> 00:12:38,790
which you can set in those accessibility

279
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:42,420
Croke controls and general settings you

280
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:45,240
can switch to a keyboard so just like a

281
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:47,759
regular keyboard you have these things

282
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:49,379
any but you can still see your screen

283
00:12:49,379 --> 00:12:51,929
above etc but now I'm going to turn

284
00:12:51,929 --> 00:12:53,699
voice over on I'm going to hold this up

285
00:12:53,699 --> 00:12:59,400
so you guys can hear it

286
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:03,680
voiceover on notes no text field is

287
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:07,530
editing character mode

288
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:11,120
let's do new one there we go

289
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:17,780
and now here's the voiceover on no no

290
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:20,480
bring off-screen input or escape there's

291
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,940
a bubble to the left table top mode

292
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:32,000
contract a b c d alright voiceover off

293
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,120
that's a good example of that and i am

294
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,030
now going to switch back so that you can

295
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:41,600
continue and if you're not a sight

296
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,430
impaired person who's had to get used to

297
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:46,970
using a device with sort of okay Google

298
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:49,160
or Alexa or a Siri barking back at you

299
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:51,290
constantly that can be a bit

300
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:54,650
disconcerting and annoying right and we

301
00:13:54,650 --> 00:13:55,820
want something that was a little bit

302
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:59,720
more seamless so I said let's make it an

303
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:02,060
NPM package and open source it and they

304
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:04,490
said yeah and we're all excited because

305
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:05,810
we're now I'm making my first

306
00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:07,610
MTM package and they're gonna help me

307
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:11,900
and this is gonna be great right and so

308
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:16,280
there it is the NPM package that's the

309
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:18,320
link if you want to go take a look at it

310
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,420
it's up there it's got to read me for it

311
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:24,130
and here is the related github

312
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:28,400
repository now the github repository has

313
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,960
one thing that the package does and

314
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,280
that's if you see at the top there's a

315
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:34,340
little app thing that's an expo app that

316
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:36,650
allows you to test and see the thing

317
00:14:36,650 --> 00:14:39,260
working and I'm gonna unplug this again

318
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:41,810
and plug it into the phone and we're

319
00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:44,780
gonna see the expo app working this is

320
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:47,450
silent because the app itself doesn't

321
00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:49,760
have any I mean the package itself

322
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,530
doesn't have accessibility but you can

323
00:14:51,530 --> 00:14:54,140
add that into what other app you put it

324
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:59,120
in so here it is working hopefully there

325
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,920
it is alright so there you go the

326
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:03,560
Braille six key input in action there's

327
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:08,660
a name there's a B there's a see there's

328
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:13,179
a D there's an e alright you can delete

329
00:15:13,179 --> 00:15:16,399
or you can clear the whole thing you

330
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:16,699
know

331
00:15:16,699 --> 00:15:19,299
and that's doing just standard Braille

332
00:15:19,299 --> 00:15:27,989
all right I'm gonna switch back now so

333
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:33,499
there we go that was working great so

334
00:15:33,499 --> 00:15:36,079
far and we got the interface and the

335
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:38,660
touch working fairly well and we were

336
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:40,699
testing it in expo on iOS and it was

337
00:15:40,699 --> 00:15:42,709
looking and we figured out be the same

338
00:15:42,709 --> 00:15:45,079
on Android and so everything's ready

339
00:15:45,079 --> 00:15:50,059
right but not quite there is as you go

340
00:15:50,059 --> 00:15:53,029
between platforms like I said many

341
00:15:53,029 --> 00:15:56,749
twists and turns initial tests on Apple

342
00:15:56,749 --> 00:15:59,389
iOS said eh okay ready so we were kind

343
00:15:59,389 --> 00:16:00,769
of feeling yeah let's go

344
00:16:00,769 --> 00:16:06,769
MVP ship at until we began to test on

345
00:16:06,769 --> 00:16:11,480
Android not so much

346
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:13,929
some of the problems we initially had

347
00:16:13,929 --> 00:16:18,079
Braille fonts those who know Braille you

348
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:22,220
that's let me see a be a see us that's

349
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:25,669
the word abacus right there I have

350
00:16:25,669 --> 00:16:28,519
learned a bit since February I wanted to

351
00:16:28,519 --> 00:16:31,999
show you that over here what we did was

352
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:35,449
I did a kind of test in code pen and

353
00:16:35,449 --> 00:16:37,549
kind of shown all sorts of different

354
00:16:37,549 --> 00:16:42,439
fonts working we have source sans sim

355
00:16:42,439 --> 00:16:43,850
Braille which comes from the American

356
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:45,919
publishing house for the blind with

357
00:16:45,919 --> 00:16:49,069
their Braille blaster program they have

358
00:16:49,069 --> 00:16:51,169
for translating Braille we tried source

359
00:16:51,169 --> 00:16:53,480
sans and Apple Gothic and other things

360
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:56,679
that had Braille in them and what Holly

361
00:16:56,679 --> 00:16:59,779
dr. Holly Lawson wanted was these

362
00:16:59,779 --> 00:17:01,429
wonderful little things called ghost

363
00:17:01,429 --> 00:17:02,839
dots and she wanted the Braille large

364
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:04,519
enough of course on phone screens and

365
00:17:04,519 --> 00:17:06,220
tablets that people could read it

366
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:09,289
especially if they weren't fully sight

367
00:17:09,289 --> 00:17:14,059
impaired but mostly sight impaired so

368
00:17:14,059 --> 00:17:17,149
okay we we we did some testing through

369
00:17:17,149 --> 00:17:18,769
this and even though these all look

370
00:17:18,769 --> 00:17:21,889
great here what we found is some of them

371
00:17:21,889 --> 00:17:23,929
just don't show up with the ghost bot

372
00:17:23,929 --> 00:17:26,339
dots even if we do react native

373
00:17:26,339 --> 00:17:30,090
link of the font once we import it even

374
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:32,100
if we do that some just don't show the

375
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:34,289
goats box dots the one that worked on

376
00:17:34,289 --> 00:17:38,760
both Apple iOS and Android Apple Braille

377
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:41,370
once you react native link it it worked

378
00:17:41,370 --> 00:17:45,570
great so let's go back here so that

379
00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:50,580
problem solved then we had the

380
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:52,350
responsiveness in portrait versus

381
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:54,600
landscape and different screen sizes for

382
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,880
different screen sizes if it wasn't

383
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:00,270
doing well with the react native style

384
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:04,470
sheets no matter what we did we had to

385
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:06,840
make certain helper functions to check

386
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:08,909
is this an iPhone 10 which is a much

387
00:18:08,909 --> 00:18:14,070
larger dots per inch screen is this is

388
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:16,080
this an iPad we did a little helper

389
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,970
functions and then we would redo redo

390
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:22,080
the style sheets based on that and I

391
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,850
also found this wonderful package react

392
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:27,029
native responsive style sheet to show

393
00:18:27,029 --> 00:18:31,500
you in our app that working here is like

394
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,899
the style sheets down here first you

395
00:18:33,899 --> 00:18:37,649
import it once it's in your package JSON

396
00:18:37,649 --> 00:18:44,429
you import it using the important

397
00:18:44,429 --> 00:18:46,260
statement up here and then down here at

398
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:48,870
the very bottom we have the style sheet

399
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:53,429
there's there's the regular normal

400
00:18:53,429 --> 00:18:55,620
styles using the responsive style sheet

401
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:58,409
create and then below there are the

402
00:18:58,409 --> 00:19:01,919
responsive styles if your normal styles

403
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:03,240
are what you want in portrait you can

404
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:05,399
just leave the Portland port the

405
00:19:05,399 --> 00:19:07,370
portrait is empty objects and then any

406
00:19:07,370 --> 00:19:09,929
variations in landscape you can put in

407
00:19:09,929 --> 00:19:12,570
there that will register and I'm going

408
00:19:12,570 --> 00:19:15,000
to unplug and plug back in again just to

409
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:21,539
show you real quick so with this in you

410
00:19:21,539 --> 00:19:27,240
can see it working like that and that's

411
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:29,730
the react native spot a style sheet

412
00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:35,460
unplugging again thank you oh you didn't

413
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:38,700
see it I'm apologize

414
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:44,850
quick let's wait till they it's plugged

415
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:50,360
back in there we go alright so here

416
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:54,470
there you go everyone see that all right

417
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:58,110
thanks for keeping me honest and unplug

418
00:19:58,110 --> 00:19:59,880
again I have to tell them that so they

419
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,200
you don't see a whole bunch of flicker

420
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:05,840
screen alright I'm plugged back into

421
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:15,480
this area so that problem solved so then

422
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:19,650
there was the question of you know being

423
00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:21,810
able to touch all the buttons at once to

424
00:20:21,810 --> 00:20:24,570
make all the Braille characters and of

425
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:28,620
course we all know that as lordy poss no

426
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:33,000
multi-touch so there are two choices

427
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,730
here a couple the first was and I'll

428
00:20:35,730 --> 00:20:37,670
show this to you the react native

429
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:41,360
gesture responders system API here it is

430
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:44,490
and it starts out pretty good and yeah

431
00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:46,440
I'm reading through it and my boss Ryan

432
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:49,350
the genius saying you should use gesture

433
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:51,360
responder system for multi-touch and I

434
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:52,860
kept reading through and I saw these

435
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:55,920
props that you attach to the view in

436
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:58,350
react native I'm going yeah but there's

437
00:20:58,350 --> 00:20:59,910
not many examples in fact there's no

438
00:20:59,910 --> 00:21:03,080
examples and oh and I got to learn

439
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:05,610
location Y and location X and geometry

440
00:21:05,610 --> 00:21:07,740
math and I started to get scared and I

441
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:09,360
said there's got to be an easy way to do

442
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,790
easier way to do this so I came back

443
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:13,830
here and I did some searching in Google

444
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:15,390
and Stack Overflow and I found

445
00:21:15,390 --> 00:21:18,390
oh well JavaScript itself has touched

446
00:21:18,390 --> 00:21:20,040
things there's the touchstart touchmove

447
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:23,820
touch n that you can add to an add event

448
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:25,680
listener with a callback function of

449
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:28,950
what you want it to do or in modern

450
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:31,230
JavaScript you can do on touch start on

451
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:34,500
touch move on touch end and I tried

452
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:37,230
those and in the expo app and on iOS

453
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:40,710
working great and we're like yes ok

454
00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:42,090
don't have to deal with that just your

455
00:21:42,090 --> 00:21:44,610
responders stuff at all yeah I did it

456
00:21:44,610 --> 00:21:49,310
and then we tried testing on Android and

457
00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:52,440
it's not react natives in the face

458
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:54,450
folk or Android swans just Android

459
00:21:54,450 --> 00:21:57,000
handles touch gestures and multi-touch

460
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,890
gestures in a different way and

461
00:21:58,890 --> 00:22:02,370
different heuristics than iOS does to

462
00:22:02,370 --> 00:22:05,820
which my boss Ryan went duh and he said

463
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:07,620
remember when I said you should maybe

464
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:13,980
try the gesture responder system so we

465
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:18,240
so I party jumping ahead so we did and

466
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,890
I'm just gonna really quick show you the

467
00:22:19,890 --> 00:22:22,650
gesture responders system as part of

468
00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:29,430
this it's so in the view here this is

469
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:31,290
the enclosing view around all these

470
00:22:31,290 --> 00:22:33,540
little Braille input components we made

471
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:39,750
here we have the in the six key input as

472
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:42,230
part of the package we have the view

473
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:44,730
views have layout and you can do a call

474
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:47,250
back function on layout which allows you

475
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:49,410
to get locations of everything on the

476
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:51,060
screen I'll show you that in a sec and

477
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:53,040
here are the gesture responder stuff

478
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:57,240
it's on on start should set responder on

479
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:59,700
respond or move on respond or release

480
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:01,830
just props on view doesn't have to be a

481
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:04,170
touchable view or a touchable opacity or

482
00:23:04,170 --> 00:23:06,180
anything like that it can be just a

483
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:08,640
regular view that's now set to respond

484
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:11,250
to multi touches here are the functions

485
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:13,170
I was telling you about here's the on

486
00:23:13,170 --> 00:23:16,140
layout that we call the on layout gets a

487
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:18,150
native event which contains a layout

488
00:23:18,150 --> 00:23:19,950
that has all sorts of stuff and then we

489
00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:24,630
use a layout measure method that react

490
00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:26,490
native supplies and we do a call back to

491
00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:28,980
that and say take that stuff in the

492
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:31,140
native object it's going to have the X&Y

493
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:33,900
of the component itself where it starts

494
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:35,130
it's going to have its width and height

495
00:23:35,130 --> 00:23:37,260
and it's going to have the absolute page

496
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:39,750
X and page Y on the screen where it's

497
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:41,790
located and then we put that in two

498
00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:43,770
state variables just what we need the

499
00:23:43,770 --> 00:23:46,680
page X goes to X page Y goes to Y width

500
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:49,560
and height and and you can see that's

501
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:53,880
our state variable right there so down

502
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:58,500
here in the move callback this is what

503
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:00,330
happened we take a native event there

504
00:24:00,330 --> 00:24:03,380
that records the change touches we say

505
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:04,530
get

506
00:24:04,530 --> 00:24:07,440
to get that the that X Y width and

507
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,330
height we put into the state variable of

508
00:24:09,330 --> 00:24:12,570
layout create a test array and if

509
00:24:12,570 --> 00:24:13,980
there's anything already in the test

510
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:15,830
array put it in there

511
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:20,520
and then we say change touches based on

512
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:23,760
their position in the as we loop through

513
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:27,090
in the array go into page X and page Y

514
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:30,270
and a constant here we create these

515
00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:31,860
variables and set them to zero and then

516
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:34,710
this is something my genius CTO came up

517
00:24:34,710 --> 00:24:36,780
with he bases this is the he helped me

518
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:39,950
out doing the Y and X math so if this

519
00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:43,590
this is the Y up and down so if it's

520
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:46,710
this much it's the third button if it

521
00:24:46,710 --> 00:24:48,510
it's the third set of row of third

522
00:24:48,510 --> 00:24:49,650
buttons if it's this much

523
00:24:49,650 --> 00:24:51,480
it's the row of second buttons if it's

524
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:53,700
this much it's the row of first buttons

525
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:56,360
and down here this is the X so if it's

526
00:24:56,360 --> 00:25:00,420
this it's three if it's this one it's

527
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:02,820
the ones on the left one the ones and

528
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:05,940
then we put all that into a thing we

529
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:07,530
call button touch array and then we do a

530
00:25:07,530 --> 00:25:09,660
switch on it and say if it's one one

531
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:11,850
that's the one button on the left is if

532
00:25:11,850 --> 00:25:13,590
it's one two that's the two button the

533
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:16,230
right except etc all the way down to six

534
00:25:16,230 --> 00:25:17,760
and that's how we did the multi-touch

535
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:21,000
and so I was very excited to learn that

536
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,550
and very grateful that he made me do the

537
00:25:23,550 --> 00:25:25,080
hard work and go all the way through

538
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:27,270
that all right

539
00:25:27,270 --> 00:25:32,060
there is one thing left that we ran into

540
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:36,540
most human beings not all but most human

541
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:38,520
beings are born with how many fingers on

542
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:42,900
each hand five right and so what is a

543
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:45,390
limitation on both iOS and Android of

544
00:25:45,390 --> 00:25:48,570
the total number of fingers that can

545
00:25:48,570 --> 00:25:53,420
touch a screen at once for phones five

546
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:56,850
that's all it'll take on phones tablets

547
00:25:56,850 --> 00:26:00,270
and iPads we'll take more but the phones

548
00:26:00,270 --> 00:26:01,290
that's it

549
00:26:01,290 --> 00:26:04,440
and that really ticked us off because in

550
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:06,750
Universal English Braille grade 2 there

551
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:10,890
is an all 6 character that you need to

552
00:26:10,890 --> 00:26:12,930
do as a modifier to describe other

553
00:26:12,930 --> 00:26:15,560
characters in the contracted Braille and

554
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:17,450
but

555
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:18,799
I'm gonna unplug and show you really

556
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:20,840
quick we found a workaround thanks to

557
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:23,240
Ryan insisting that I do the hard work

558
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:25,159
and do the gesture responder Swift

559
00:26:25,159 --> 00:26:32,269
system plugged in and what we can do

560
00:26:32,269 --> 00:26:33,950
because we're using just your responder

561
00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:40,220
we do one two three four five right but

562
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:42,230
not won't take anymore I'm hitting six

563
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:43,669
nothing happened but then I can lift off

564
00:26:43,669 --> 00:26:46,070
of five if five is still part of the

565
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:48,830
array that we're building I touch six

566
00:26:48,830 --> 00:26:51,169
with that finger release there's the

567
00:26:51,169 --> 00:26:53,779
full thing so we did find a good

568
00:26:53,779 --> 00:26:59,299
workaround for it gonna unplug again all

569
00:26:59,299 --> 00:26:59,750
right

570
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:06,830
so finishing up so I think we've all

571
00:27:06,830 --> 00:27:08,480
learned something here today don't you

572
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:13,570
oh there it goes

573
00:27:13,570 --> 00:27:17,010
there we go

574
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:19,560
wait that slide doesn't look quite right

575
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:22,080
that's better

576
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:24,940
all right so there's this open-source

577
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:29,170
package for 6ki braille ueb input in

578
00:27:29,170 --> 00:27:31,840
react native it's an alternative

579
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,520
solution to the OS platform

580
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:37,600
accessibility in apps as I said the road

581
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:40,030
to making things work the same in both

582
00:27:40,030 --> 00:27:43,270
react native and Apple iOS and Google

583
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:46,300
Android is not the happy rainbow sparkle

584
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:49,480
Playland you'd think and it's open

585
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:51,970
source so we're saying please four can

586
00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:53,950
contribute if you're going to contribute

587
00:27:53,950 --> 00:27:56,620
directly to this project email is on the

588
00:27:56,620 --> 00:27:59,380
github and the and the NPM repository

589
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:00,700
and we ask you write us first to make

590
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:02,470
sure as as maintained as we want to make

591
00:28:02,470 --> 00:28:03,760
sure it's the direction we want the

592
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:06,550
package to go but if you want a fork and

593
00:28:06,550 --> 00:28:08,140
use it for something else that's what

594
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:09,550
you could do for instance we made this

595
00:28:09,550 --> 00:28:13,860
react native maybe you want a fork and

596
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:16,540
refactor the code for just regular react

597
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:19,300
for the web maybe you want to reef just

598
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:21,160
read it and go over it and do something

599
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:24,310
similar for angular for view hey Yahoo

600
00:28:24,310 --> 00:28:27,270
de was here yesterday for ember you know

601
00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:29,680
we you know there's all sorts of things

602
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:31,840
that one of my next projects after we do

603
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:34,930
the release for like 1:1 or 1/5 is in

604
00:28:34,930 --> 00:28:38,080
landscape on tablets we want to have the

605
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:40,570
fingers buttons at an angle because

606
00:28:40,570 --> 00:28:41,950
that's the way most people will be

607
00:28:41,950 --> 00:28:44,050
touching the screen so we want to make

608
00:28:44,050 --> 00:28:47,680
it easier for them but wait there's more

609
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:51,010
that app itself ueb prep we want to make

610
00:28:51,010 --> 00:28:53,440
it into an open-source framework for any

611
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:56,440
sort of education training handbook etc

612
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:59,560
its experience it's got a from the front

613
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:02,260
end react native app and it has a

614
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:05,440
back-end admin which has a front-end for

615
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:07,930
the web that's in react native web and

616
00:29:07,930 --> 00:29:10,210
we use storybook to check the components

617
00:29:10,210 --> 00:29:13,770
there and the backend of it is using AWS

618
00:29:13,770 --> 00:29:16,390
lambda with with server list which is a

619
00:29:16,390 --> 00:29:19,810
node.js implementation it kim and that's

620
00:29:19,810 --> 00:29:22,360
what we write our api sin is a node on

621
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:25,960
service can be configured to contain

622
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:28,300
training exercises and meteor rich video

623
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:30,530
and audio experiences i could also

624
00:29:30,530 --> 00:29:32,480
say if you're like if you're like with

625
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:35,600
tree house and you want to do an app

626
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,850
where people finish and then if they

627
00:29:37,850 --> 00:29:40,250
want to take the next course they have

628
00:29:40,250 --> 00:29:41,630
to pay for it you can incorporate

629
00:29:41,630 --> 00:29:44,600
ecommerce into it also

630
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:46,790
Universal Design lab as you can see on

631
00:29:46,790 --> 00:29:48,680
the far right has already got a new skin

632
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:50,960
on it for other accessibility stuff

633
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:53,510
they're going to do and one of our big

634
00:29:53,510 --> 00:29:55,910
clients at the circus Inc is also Hood

635
00:29:55,910 --> 00:29:58,190
to Coast we do all their websites they

636
00:29:58,190 --> 00:30:00,080
don't just do the one who'd to Coast

637
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:02,000
race they do races all over the world

638
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,120
all right including in China and other

639
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:08,840
places and we made the app for them

640
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:11,900
using this framework weary skinned it we

641
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:14,060
gave them their own back-end they put in

642
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:17,090
all sorts of information for their

643
00:30:17,090 --> 00:30:19,280
handbook and we help them by going out

644
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:21,920
with a drone team and we photographed

645
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:23,720
some of the major legs that they had

646
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:26,240
video of with drones and that's all in

647
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,760
that app that app was done in a little

648
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:31,250
over three weeks just using this

649
00:30:31,250 --> 00:30:35,510
framework and the skins it's amazing so

00:30:35,510 --> 00:30:37,580
