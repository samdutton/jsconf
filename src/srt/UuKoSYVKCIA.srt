1
00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:12,200

my name is Paul becos um I actually had

2
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:14,780
to change those slides yesterday which

3
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:17,960
is really hectic because yesterday we

4
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:20,540
just announced our Equus the acquisition

5
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:24,200
which was Zynga actually bought us

6
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:29,869
yesterday and and yeah all right thank

7
00:00:29,869 --> 00:00:35,060
you so basically we're not text us

8
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:37,070
anymore those slides were all based on

9
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:39,469
dextrose branding and all that stuff so

10
00:00:39,469 --> 00:00:41,480
we're not direct textures anymore it's

11
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:43,399
it's really good that I'm not talking

12
00:00:43,399 --> 00:00:45,850
about the others engine itself today

13
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:49,160
because the Ava's engine will likely not

14
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:52,089
be like sensible anymore anymore soon

15
00:00:52,089 --> 00:00:53,960
but there's a lot of new cool stuff

16
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:55,510
coming up and I still want to talk about

17
00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:58,010
how to develop fast browser games so

18
00:00:58,010 --> 00:00:59,989
it's still fitting into the direction

19
00:00:59,989 --> 00:01:03,289
that we're heading um so yeah just just

20
00:01:03,289 --> 00:01:04,970
on this I'd sorry we were opening a new

21
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:06,680
office in Frankfort which is called

22
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:09,920
singha Germany so basically singers

23
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:15,380
coming to you rope and and that's it

24
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:16,550
yeah that's the whole like position

25
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:17,630
please read about it in tech with

26
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:21,020
TechCrunch if you want to so who has

27
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:24,500
seen some video on the others engine can

28
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:27,650
you raise hands a bit ok quite a lot ok

29
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:32,030
nice so with the other having success

30
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:33,950
and V wasn't over having success of the

31
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:36,230
artists engine prototypes lots of people

32
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:39,890
actually ask us questions and questions

33
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:42,290
were like how do you actually get this

34
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:44,510
stuff's done yeah so we are showing

35
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:49,270
stuff like this is my 27-inch imac and

36
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:51,230
another screen attached so we were

37
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:54,830
testing all our prototypes on over full

38
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:58,640
HD resolutions and people were asking

39
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,070
all the stuff and I've been trying to go

40
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:02,690
to conferences and talk about it but

41
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:05,050
there's always not enough time and then

42
00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:07,550
you know I always try to pick up stuff

43
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:12,110
that's really interesting so and you

44
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:14,390
know also right now is the perfect time

45
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:15,950
to talk about it because only very

46
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:17,819
recently we got powerful enough hardware

47
00:02:17,819 --> 00:02:21,599
to run a lot's of crazy JavaScript um it

48
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,280
depends on whether you go mobile or

49
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,530
desktop obviously new advanced

50
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:27,810
technology sees three html5 you all know

51
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:30,359
that highly optimized rendering engines

52
00:02:30,359 --> 00:02:33,299
v8 nitro there's a lot of crazy stuff

53
00:02:33,299 --> 00:02:38,250
coming up from Mozilla as well now so we

54
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:39,959
figured out early this year that right

55
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:42,030
now is the right time to do to try to do

56
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:44,760
gaming too because gaming is really just

57
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:47,069
a just a very new field in the web in

58
00:02:47,069 --> 00:02:50,159
general and then an untested field so I

59
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:51,989
still think we were probably the first

60
00:02:51,989 --> 00:02:54,870
company who try to do our JavaScript

61
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:56,730
gaming like a real commercial game

62
00:02:56,730 --> 00:03:01,650
engine plugin less and so additionally

63
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:04,199
and why wasn't that happening before why

64
00:03:04,199 --> 00:03:06,810
why was not happening because you know

65
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:08,430
we're figuring and we were talking to a

66
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:11,549
lot of companies and we realized there's

67
00:03:11,549 --> 00:03:12,959
lots of knowledge needed to build

68
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:15,329
sophisticated games but many of those

69
00:03:15,329 --> 00:03:17,310
game companies even in Germany like

70
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:19,579
gameforge big point lots of those

71
00:03:19,579 --> 00:03:22,889
started as a hobby and extra web

72
00:03:22,889 --> 00:03:24,629
developers and I'm one of them like I'm

73
00:03:24,629 --> 00:03:27,090
not a game developer by heart I'm I've

74
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:30,030
been a web developer for years now actor

75
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:32,069
web devs are seldom good game developers

76
00:03:32,069 --> 00:03:34,759
and vice versa and that's a huge issue

77
00:03:34,759 --> 00:03:37,979
so there's very few around us who know

78
00:03:37,979 --> 00:03:40,439
both worlds and really it's a whole

79
00:03:40,439 --> 00:03:42,060
training process and it's a self

80
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:43,739
training process for me as well I've

81
00:03:43,739 --> 00:03:46,229
been developing all those techniques who

82
00:03:46,229 --> 00:03:48,659
are unique for the web so that's why I

83
00:03:48,659 --> 00:03:52,259
really want to share them so let's

84
00:03:52,259 --> 00:03:54,689
before digging in into the hot sauce

85
00:03:54,689 --> 00:03:56,519
let's first talk a bit about the open

86
00:03:56,519 --> 00:04:03,900
web stack and so html5 okay yeah

87
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:06,599
everyone loves html5 and everyone loves

88
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:08,310
a buzzword and the other hand you know

89
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:11,060
people are talking about this html5

90
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:13,500
html5 game engine coming up and I was

91
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:18,169
like well year it's not really html5 and

92
00:04:18,169 --> 00:04:20,880
since you no html5 we're actually not

93
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,370
using anything of the html5 standard yet

94
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:25,770
which may be the possible exception of

95
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:27,539
video and audio which are two things

96
00:04:27,539 --> 00:04:29,250
that we are using but other than that

97
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:29,920
like

98
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,600
all those new nice switches and controls

99
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,760
and then the new stuff coming up we're

100
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:36,130
not using any of it in fact and we're

101
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:38,020
not even canvas we're not even using

102
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:40,270
canvas for rendering which I go into

103
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:43,480
detail right right away so it's really

104
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,820
not an html5 engine and such HTML

105
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:49,480
Javascript CSS engine it's using autumn

106
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:52,090
and it might be using html5 and a lot of

107
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:54,280
those features in the future but really

108
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:57,400
it's just using the open web stack so

109
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,740
our pig really is vanilla HTML CSS for

110
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:02,620
rendering JavaScript for scripting

111
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:06,040
client and server canvas but only as a

112
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:08,680
tool and not for rendering and CSS

113
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,960
transforms and both of them

114
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,700
cross-platform I go into detail about

115
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:18,340
one of them in a bit so and then jQuery

116
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:21,940
and jQuery I so on I've been a core team

117
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:24,300
member of Jake we for some time now and

118
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:27,220
it did it really made sense to use

119
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:29,110
jQuery and why didn't make sense it made

120
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:31,870
sense because jquery library focus on

121
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:33,730
certain tasks the effort doesn't get in

122
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:35,620
our way so we cannot afford a framework

123
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:37,420
that restricts us that's really the

124
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:38,980
difference between framework and library

125
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:41,980
so we needed a tool that can eat some

126
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:44,890
task force like doing selectors so I'm

127
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:46,870
also what we need it and that's really

128
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:48,550
important Jake Lee comes with great

129
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:49,960
event support and they did a lot of

130
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:53,890
overhaul recently on event triggering

131
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:56,050
and binding performance so that's that's

132
00:05:56,050 --> 00:05:59,890
really sweet yjp I um Jake we arrived

133
00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:01,330
really there's a different use case

134
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:03,850
because we actually can't use any of the

135
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:05,770
widget subject lets you build richer

136
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:08,080
interactions on top without restrictions

137
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:11,140
for instance panning a world map is one

138
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:12,550
of them since it really requires

139
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:14,590
drag-and-drop but it's a different

140
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:17,230
interaction and the bonus really is a

141
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:20,170
patch by me to support touch events so

142
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:22,450
basic by using that Mouse interaction

143
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:24,880
widget that support static touch avenge

144
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,980
the events on mobile browsers like iOS

145
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:30,520
um I had that whole new abstraction that

146
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,530
really does it all for me so that's

147
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:36,430
that's really good um you also need to

148
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:37,990
think about cross browser if you think

149
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:39,940
about open web stack you do need to

150
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:41,560
think about cross browser does your game

151
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,070
engine

152
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:43,510
your game really does need to be

153
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:46,900
cross-browser i really find out that

154
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:49,240
usually it's not the case because

155
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,040
sometimes you just want to do a mobile

156
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,600
game and you just want to do it for

157
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:55,750
WebKit browsers so if your engine is

158
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:57,940
platform-specific there's no real need

159
00:06:57,940 --> 00:06:59,520
to care about cross browser and

160
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:03,160
obviously the pro is that it's really

161
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:07,630
extreme development speed up so if you

162
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:09,940
if you do an iphone game really try to

163
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:12,760
only do iphones specific stuff and

164
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,110
sometimes you don't even need to use a

165
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:18,250
library for that also if you start

166
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:20,410
working on the game today chances are

167
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:22,060
very likely that will not be out in the

168
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:23,800
upcoming months so don't worry about

169
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:26,130
today pick technologies from the future

170
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:29,410
obviously it's a bit of you know risky

171
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:32,440
to to to think about what will happen in

172
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:34,630
the future but your game really won't be

173
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:38,440
ready to mow on predict wisely so let's

174
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:40,740
stick into architecture and API design

175
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:44,020
what you want to keep in mind first of

176
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:45,520
all there's a couple of impossibilities

177
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,670
that rediscovered first of all this

178
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:50,590
journalist that cannot be implemented

179
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:53,290
soon but pretty soon for instance casual

180
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:55,450
3d games you'll see in quake 3d in the

181
00:07:55,450 --> 00:07:58,570
browser simple shooters using WebGL I

182
00:07:58,570 --> 00:08:01,840
think that's fairly possible anytime

183
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:04,270
soon I think WebGL is not stable enough

184
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:07,390
to do it right now but please prove me

185
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:12,460
wrong you know also WebGL needs to you

186
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:14,050
know there's a lot of work and needs to

187
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:16,330
be done like a nice shaders and top of

188
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:19,840
it nice libraries on top of it I know

189
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,660
that Google's are converting Oh 3d which

190
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:25,210
is really nice but it still takes some

191
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:27,640
time also genres that cannot be

192
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,070
implemented for many years to come

193
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:32,979
includes next-gen 3d games like if you

194
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:35,770
think about doing final fantasy 13 like

195
00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:38,020
a big-ass console game for the web

196
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:40,599
that's not in my opinion not going to

197
00:08:40,599 --> 00:08:42,969
happen anytime soon I've seen really

198
00:08:42,969 --> 00:08:46,090
like a lot of games unity based WebGL

199
00:08:46,090 --> 00:08:48,280
base that are upcoming from the big

200
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:51,760
browser game companies and most of them

201
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,209
and this is really unfair

202
00:08:53,209 --> 00:08:55,819
most of them look like quake 10 years

203
00:08:55,819 --> 00:08:57,889
ago which is not the impression that we

204
00:08:57,889 --> 00:09:00,910
want to give with our games like really

205
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:04,399
if you think about online gaming you do

206
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:06,350
want to have something that lives for

207
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:08,329
years to come because most browsers tend

208
00:09:08,329 --> 00:09:11,089
to have a really long lifespan and most

209
00:09:11,089 --> 00:09:13,249
browser games so if you're looking at

210
00:09:13,249 --> 00:09:15,470
popular German titles they tend to have

211
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:17,540
a lifespan for over 10 years people keep

212
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:19,670
playing them for 10 years so if they

213
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:22,309
look bad after 10 years like which which

214
00:09:22,309 --> 00:09:23,959
happened to most PlayStation titles

215
00:09:23,959 --> 00:09:25,939
that's not good if you're looking at

216
00:09:25,939 --> 00:09:27,769
Super Mario from 10 years ago it still

217
00:09:27,769 --> 00:09:30,170
looks som some kind of nice it still

218
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:32,779
looks good so on that's just our

219
00:09:32,779 --> 00:09:35,290
decision we made a decision to just do

220
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:39,230
to DN to that 50 so what is left to diab

221
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:41,420
viously puzzles adventure board games

222
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:43,970
card games platformers German runs all

223
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:46,819
that stuff to 25 D which is RPGs

224
00:09:46,819 --> 00:09:49,579
strategy turn-based real-time simulation

225
00:09:49,579 --> 00:09:53,019
and there's a lot more use cases and

226
00:09:53,019 --> 00:09:55,939
really what we choose for prototypes if

227
00:09:55,939 --> 00:09:57,799
you haven't seen it yet we choose

228
00:09:57,799 --> 00:10:00,529
something like that so this is our

229
00:10:00,529 --> 00:10:02,540
newest prototype that we release that

230
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:06,079
III earlier this year and this is kind

231
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:10,100
of a Sim City world community so you

232
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:12,439
have those houses and and you can walk

233
00:10:12,439 --> 00:10:14,119
around and check with your friends and

234
00:10:14,119 --> 00:10:16,040
do crazy stuff it's all in real time

235
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:18,949
it's all graphical and it's all

236
00:10:18,949 --> 00:10:23,360
JavaScript and plug in us so um what we

237
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,129
really wanted and that's just a really

238
00:10:25,129 --> 00:10:27,259
quick feature list free Mouse planning

239
00:10:27,259 --> 00:10:29,079
obviously infinite realtime worlds

240
00:10:29,079 --> 00:10:31,069
non-rectangular objects animated

241
00:10:31,069 --> 00:10:32,569
characters chat bubbles collision

242
00:10:32,569 --> 00:10:34,759
detection pathfinding walking into

243
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:38,749
houses mashups a sound effects scalable

244
00:10:38,749 --> 00:10:41,480
viewports and obviously MMO readiness so

245
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:44,199
it scales to thousands of people and

246
00:10:44,199 --> 00:10:47,149
people were asking me this is all nice

247
00:10:47,149 --> 00:10:49,339
but you know this kind of sounds like

248
00:10:49,339 --> 00:10:53,809
the Duke right this is really a huge

249
00:10:53,809 --> 00:10:56,660
featureless and there right there right

250
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:58,910
if you try to develop a classic game

251
00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:01,249
engine that might be the case but we

252
00:11:01,249 --> 00:11:03,889
aiming for the web so let's dig into the

253
00:11:03,889 --> 00:11:05,449
special sauce now I know you're waiting

254
00:11:05,449 --> 00:11:06,339
for it probably

255
00:11:06,339 --> 00:11:09,269
so that sets come up with some of the

256
00:11:09,269 --> 00:11:13,059
things that we discovered the first of

257
00:11:13,059 --> 00:11:17,439
all rendering we had the question of how

258
00:11:17,439 --> 00:11:19,689
do I actually rendered 2,000 objects in

259
00:11:19,689 --> 00:11:21,790
less than 50 milliseconds because that

260
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:24,069
if you're looking at scaling viewports

261
00:11:24,069 --> 00:11:27,220
to full HD that's some test case that

262
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:32,439
really might happen and where we what we

263
00:11:32,439 --> 00:11:36,459
thought right was obviously I use canvas

264
00:11:36,459 --> 00:11:38,649
because canvas is the hot new thing and

265
00:11:38,649 --> 00:11:40,959
and canvas is sexy and canvas is

266
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:43,870
hardware accelerated now so canvas is

267
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:45,730
really the way to go and you can load

268
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:49,480
images in canvas all nice so here's what

269
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:53,649
happened we figured out that canvas in

270
00:11:53,649 --> 00:11:55,389
fact is a lot slower than everything

271
00:11:55,389 --> 00:11:58,559
else so if you're using a lot of images

272
00:11:58,559 --> 00:12:01,230
canvas really drags you down because

273
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:05,410
canvas image API unfortunate since you

274
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:07,269
always have to initialize the image

275
00:12:07,269 --> 00:12:10,149
using the Dom then you have to wait for

276
00:12:10,149 --> 00:12:12,339
it to load until you can actually render

277
00:12:12,339 --> 00:12:15,550
it out to the canvas um which means if

278
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:17,279
you're working with lots of graphics is

279
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,749
actually waste lowered and just do DOM

280
00:12:19,749 --> 00:12:22,779
and just have dibs all over the place

281
00:12:22,779 --> 00:12:26,439
and work with images so that was

282
00:12:26,439 --> 00:12:29,110
frustrating but you know I really just

283
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:31,660
want to get it fast so i didn't use

284
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:34,959
canvas ruining rendering after all but

285
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:37,480
um that actual explanation was kind of

286
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:39,370
not enough for many people they were

287
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:41,470
talking like okay I can kind of

288
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:43,420
understand that and but you still you

289
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:45,040
know you're still constructing Dom

290
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,379
elements with tips to and images and

291
00:12:47,379 --> 00:12:49,749
whatever it's not like that it should be

292
00:12:49,749 --> 00:12:53,889
a huge difference so why can it be that

293
00:12:53,889 --> 00:12:57,910
much slower so canvas best redrawing and

294
00:12:57,910 --> 00:12:59,589
that's another big point it's also

295
00:12:59,589 --> 00:13:02,290
extremely painful as we had any talk if

296
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:03,790
you've attended the talk right before

297
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:05,709
that they were talking about this little

298
00:13:05,709 --> 00:13:08,589
bit so I feel if you're working with

299
00:13:08,589 --> 00:13:11,079
canvas what you have to do is if you

300
00:13:11,079 --> 00:13:12,519
have something on the screen happening

301
00:13:12,519 --> 00:13:15,160
and and the character fences is moving

302
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:16,959
on the screen and moving its position

303
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:18,310
what you usually do

304
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:20,350
simply wipe out the Holts hold scream

305
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:22,540
the whole frame again and rendered once

306
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:25,120
again all the stuff that goes in it and

307
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:28,600
that tends to be really really slow if

308
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,279
you're looking at operating systems and

309
00:13:30,279 --> 00:13:32,500
browsers in general what browsers do and

310
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:34,390
what operating systems do is partial

311
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:37,510
redrawing so really what you do have to

312
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:39,910
do if you want to do a scalable game in

313
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:41,500
canvas you have to implement your own

314
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:44,230
partial redrawing algorithm so what you

315
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:46,540
have to do have to analyze the areas

316
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:49,360
that really do change and basically only

317
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:52,120
read or those areas and this gets really

318
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:54,190
reach tricky believe me okay you have to

319
00:13:54,190 --> 00:13:56,140
invest a lot of time into getting this

320
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:58,270
right and impulsive vendors we're doing

321
00:13:58,270 --> 00:14:00,130
it and you know if you're working with

322
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:02,020
thumb the browser vendors are already

323
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:04,300
doing it for you so I figured it might

324
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:06,310
be really good to just do dham for our

325
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:11,650
prototypes so really the basic message I

326
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:14,260
want to give you don't just go for

327
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:16,240
feature because it's hot and because

328
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:19,690
it's new um really try out what you want

329
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:22,900
to do and test my testing is key test

330
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:24,940
until you really are confident that it's

331
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:27,339
the right solution for your case and the

332
00:14:27,339 --> 00:14:29,260
right solution for my case was pure

333
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:33,960
vanilla Dom so our next one delegation

334
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:37,630
as i mentioned events is really

335
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:39,820
important for all kinds of stuff we're

336
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:44,260
doing so what we came up with with was

337
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:46,810
really one event to rule them all that

338
00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:49,120
is actually three events one of them is

339
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,860
mouse move but those are the three that

340
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:53,100
are most important to control the game

341
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:55,600
obviously can you can have keyboard

342
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,700
control as well but for our prototypes

343
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:59,380
that were that were the three events

344
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:03,940
events that we need it so if you think

345
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:05,910
about clicking on objects for instance

346
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:10,209
since its using event delegation yeah

347
00:15:10,209 --> 00:15:12,040
obviously like you have that you know

348
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:14,200
that's that's a diff and you just put it

349
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:17,620
somewhere on your map and what happens

350
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:19,120
now well obviously it's using a

351
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,760
background graphic some P&G with alpha

352
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,740
transparency and well you can click on

353
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:25,779
it but you know you can click on the

354
00:15:25,779 --> 00:15:28,060
alpha transparency to which kind of

355
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:29,770
sucks because that that's really not the

356
00:15:29,770 --> 00:15:31,580
kind of experience that you want

357
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:33,320
I go if for instance if I have another

358
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:36,950
house behind that one and I click into

359
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:39,590
that transparent area I'm not expecting

360
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:42,980
that house to actually be lounge at

361
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:46,190
whatever opening pop-up so this this

362
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:48,650
really kind of sucks so what we came up

363
00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:51,740
with was something really creative and

364
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:55,640
that is click food maps this is well

365
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:57,830
maybe not that creative but creative web

366
00:15:57,830 --> 00:16:00,020
in the web and creative in the way we do

367
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:04,010
it so um the game industry was doing

368
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:05,750
that all over again they were doing it

369
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:08,240
for years but I haven't seen this in the

370
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:11,600
web any anywhere so what it means it's

371
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,030
build up pixel map for each object that

372
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:16,370
tells us what it turns when pixels are

373
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:19,070
so if it's transparent then check behind

374
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:21,530
until you find a valid target so this is

375
00:16:21,530 --> 00:16:23,990
pretty easy because if you if you do the

376
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:26,150
event delegation from the top you always

377
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:28,370
know you always control your viewport so

378
00:16:28,370 --> 00:16:30,530
you always know where your stuff is in

379
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:33,920
general if in your JavaScript so

380
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,200
checking behind is really not that hard

381
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,030
and this fixes our issue which is really

382
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:41,620
nice however there's one issue with that

383
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:43,850
building up those pixel maps is

384
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:47,600
amazingly crappy work it's hard and you

385
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,430
have to automate it somehow so what we

386
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:52,640
did is we lack canvas to it so this is

387
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:54,170
what I mentioned when I said I use

388
00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:56,120
canvas as a tool I'm not using a

389
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:58,190
rendering I'm just using it to actually

390
00:16:58,190 --> 00:17:00,830
read pixel data of the images then we

391
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:02,390
check if our pixel is in fact

392
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:04,699
transparent and then save this value in

393
00:17:04,699 --> 00:17:07,280
a new optimized array and basically use

394
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,680
this whenever we need to check and it

395
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:12,170
actually scares really well so EXCI

396
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:14,150
works really well you have to be careful

397
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:15,890
if you want to support IE six but other

398
00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:19,640
than that it's nice so that's just one

399
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:24,350
of the tricks next one exit surfaces I

400
00:17:24,350 --> 00:17:26,209
was talking about this a bit in our

401
00:17:26,209 --> 00:17:29,000
videos but I might be going a bit more

402
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,700
into detail to today which is really new

403
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:34,910
content so action surfaces was something

404
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:38,780
we came up it's basically drop of over

405
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:41,930
widgets or other objects so if you look

406
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:43,990
at that TV right the

407
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:46,690
black screen basically would be an area

408
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:49,000
where you could drop generic content for

409
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,280
instance I frames or whatever so they

410
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,080
transformed to isometric projection in

411
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:55,510
real time using CSS transforms since by

412
00:17:55,510 --> 00:17:58,330
using CSS transforms you can transform

413
00:17:58,330 --> 00:18:00,640
to isometry on the fly and its really

414
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:03,070
way cool and that's also something by

415
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:04,840
the way that could not be possible if

416
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:06,700
you were to use canvas because if you

417
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:08,200
were to use canvas obviously you have

418
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,210
one surface and there's no way to

419
00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:12,490
actually stick something in the weed so

420
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:14,950
if you were to use canvas for rendering

421
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:16,720
you would and you wanted to support

422
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,750
action surfaces you would have to you

423
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:21,610
know Annalise if there's any action

424
00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:24,850
surface on the screen and then and then

425
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:27,130
generate multiple canvases that lay on

426
00:18:27,130 --> 00:18:30,190
top which is also kind of frustrating so

427
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:32,320
since we're yeah if we are using the

428
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,760
domain and the whole layering is

429
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,860
controlled by the browser that's really

430
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:39,490
easy so on how would you do it that's

431
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:43,390
just a code snippet just I might be

432
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:44,740
releasing this somewhere so it can

433
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:47,380
actually copied so those are that CSS

434
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:48,910
transforms needed and it's really not

435
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:50,559
much it was really hard to come up with

436
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:53,440
this crap but um and I don't know how

437
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,270
the numbers how I actually got two

438
00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:58,090
numbers to be honest but it works so

439
00:18:58,090 --> 00:19:00,730
it's busy i think i read it up on

440
00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:02,679
wikipedia and figured out how to do the

441
00:19:02,679 --> 00:19:05,230
isometric projections and so if you're

442
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:07,390
using those classes on any of your

443
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:09,640
elements it basically transforms them to

444
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:12,309
the right angle to the right isometric

445
00:19:12,309 --> 00:19:16,179
projection and it's really a nifty but

446
00:19:16,179 --> 00:19:20,410
of course you know if we want to build a

447
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:22,240
game we want to support into exploring

448
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,940
even with ie9 and i'm really happy about

449
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:27,910
iodine by the way I'm not so happy that

450
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:30,970
it doesn't support CSS transforms which

451
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:34,540
is kind of bad but in Thai explorer

452
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:37,390
really obviously is if you want to do a

453
00:19:37,390 --> 00:19:39,429
game that's guys well you need to

454
00:19:39,429 --> 00:19:41,910
support in an explorer so what do you do

455
00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:46,720
I found out that I II actually owns so

456
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:49,179
if you dig deep into the source of a

457
00:19:49,179 --> 00:19:51,520
dick into the msdn you find some

458
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,980
interesting stuff so one thing that many

459
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:55,450
people don't know who is who has heard

460
00:19:55,450 --> 00:19:56,290
of the

461
00:19:56,290 --> 00:19:58,480
mattrick's filled up before race your

462
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,300
hands okay there's a couple of them nice

463
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:03,280
so on if you dig into the amis end and

464
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,440
really deeply and then it's painful but

465
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:08,440
it's worth it you find the matrix filter

466
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,060
and the madrix filter really is very

467
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:13,000
very similar to the matrix function in

468
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,960
CSS transforms except for two things

469
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:18,400
there's no translating in the matrix

470
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,070
filter if you well there is but that's

471
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:23,740
an anecdote by the way but if you want

472
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:25,390
to rotate an element for instance right

473
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:28,060
you rotate it and then the actual box

474
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:30,640
changes its size obviously since if you

475
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,890
rotate it for instance the Box gets its

476
00:20:32,890 --> 00:20:36,010
higher and in inter Explorer you can

477
00:20:36,010 --> 00:20:37,900
actually have it either set to clipping

478
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:40,240
so we'll actually clip that content and

479
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,520
base you not see parts of the box

480
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:44,710
anymore which is usually not what you

481
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:48,520
want and only if you use that clipping

482
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:51,190
method the translating works if you are

483
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:53,170
not using clipping and if you knew if

484
00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:55,270
you use the auto scaling feature of

485
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:58,710
which luckily into x plus reports

486
00:20:58,710 --> 00:21:01,660
somehow translating is broken so I don't

487
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:03,430
know why but this is just something you

488
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:05,320
have to work around so the matrix is

489
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:07,150
really working very similar to CSS

490
00:21:07,150 --> 00:21:09,970
transforms so what I did I came up with

491
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:13,140
a plug-in called transform me which

492
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:15,430
basically does the following it parses

493
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:18,280
Tai Chi's and inline styles in IE tracks

494
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:21,130
them using the I only on property change

495
00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:23,590
which is really nifty by the way and it

496
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:25,180
creates a custom metrics for every

497
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:27,820
function like rotate scale skew because

498
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:29,860
CSS transforms has all those extra

499
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:32,200
functions as well then multiplies our

500
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:34,540
mattresses using Sylvester jas which is

501
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:37,240
really nice and creates the I metrics

502
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:39,070
failure in the end with the combined

503
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:41,230
result on the element and that works

504
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:43,630
amazingly well and since I've once done

505
00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:48,220
a cover flow with CSS transforms which

506
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:49,900
really had a lot of interaction so you

507
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:51,820
had to actually do it like every

508
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:53,560
millisecond and something like that and

509
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:56,590
it was working fine on I six on i-55

510
00:21:56,590 --> 00:21:59,890
even which was quite interesting so I

511
00:21:59,890 --> 00:22:01,870
transform it really does it all for you

512
00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:03,490
you yeah amber transform me like X

513
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:04,070
canvas

514
00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:05,840
and you don't have to care about it

515
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:09,460
anymore it really just works hopefully

516
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:14,020
not in all cases by the most cases so

517
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:16,550
that's one of the one of the things and

518
00:22:16,550 --> 00:22:18,050
if you want to check it out this one is

519
00:22:18,050 --> 00:22:21,020
actually open source so go grab it on

520
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:27,760
github if you want to so our next one

521
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:31,010
hardware acceleration one of the key

522
00:22:31,010 --> 00:22:33,020
things about browser gaming in Java

523
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:35,360
JavaScript and that is something I had

524
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:39,410
to realize the hard way you know last

525
00:22:39,410 --> 00:22:41,360
year when all the nice browser engines

526
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,650
were coming up with like then all the

527
00:22:42,650 --> 00:22:44,000
nice javascript engines and always like

528
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,230
oh I never have to care about

529
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:48,020
performance anymore nice but you know

530
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:50,170
that's only a few work on the desktop

531
00:22:50,170 --> 00:22:52,430
really it's just it's so frustrating

532
00:22:52,430 --> 00:22:54,980
even on netbooks most of the engines

533
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:56,870
work nicely today but if you're looking

534
00:22:56,870 --> 00:22:58,730
at mobile phones and we wanted to

535
00:22:58,730 --> 00:23:01,160
support mobile phones and tablets the

536
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:03,380
story is really interesting and install

537
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:05,600
really is different so if you if you're

538
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:08,120
working on games that support multiple

539
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:10,010
platforms you do have to care about

540
00:23:10,010 --> 00:23:11,660
performance and you do have to care

541
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:13,580
about performance a lot so how do i

542
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:15,530
acceleration really is one big example

543
00:23:15,530 --> 00:23:19,640
of how you can prove that first of all

544
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:21,020
and that was in the other talk as well

545
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:23,360
how do you accelerate the open web stack

546
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,310
there's basically two areas that work

547
00:23:25,310 --> 00:23:28,190
right now which is canvas and 3d CSS

548
00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:32,330
transforms people like the the marketing

549
00:23:32,330 --> 00:23:33,980
departments of ie9 and things like that

550
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:36,620
tend to say their Hardware accelerating

551
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:37,970
the whole browser which is simply not

552
00:23:37,970 --> 00:23:41,110
true so there's only certain areas where

553
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:44,390
hardware acceleration is in place so

554
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:47,500
cameras and CSS transforms for canvas

555
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:50,000
really good news you actually don't have

556
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,280
to do anything additionally so that is

557
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:53,690
if you're running one of the following

558
00:23:53,690 --> 00:23:56,810
browsers which is i 95 fox 4 and chrome

559
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:58,280
nighty I don't know if there's any other

560
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:02,000
browser that I've forgot anyone okay I

561
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,120
guess not sorry

562
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:09,559
oh yeah that's true way too yeah so um

563
00:24:09,559 --> 00:24:11,480
you also have to care about the platform

564
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:14,990
it's running on but in general if you

565
00:24:14,990 --> 00:24:16,820
are on a platform that is Hardware

566
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:18,559
excellent can hardware accelerating

567
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:20,390
canvas you don't have to care about it

568
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:24,500
anymore just working for CSS transforms

569
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:27,110
it's a different case because you see

570
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:29,600
you are using 2d CSS transforms for

571
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:30,830
instance if you want to rotate an

572
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:32,540
element you're just using the rotate

573
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:34,880
function which is basically 2d CSS

574
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:37,580
transforms but unfortunately those 2d

575
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:39,080
CSS transforms don't get how we

576
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:43,010
accelerated so 3d CSS transforms on the

577
00:24:43,010 --> 00:24:45,050
other hand our all GPU has accelerated

578
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:47,510
on browser to support them for instance

579
00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:50,390
safari in Chrome for instance they just

580
00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:53,720
map to the 2d functions so they won't

581
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:56,480
get accelerated but if you're using

582
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:01,550
safari I should work so 3d transforms

583
00:25:01,550 --> 00:25:03,679
are all accelerated but on the other

584
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:06,559
hand you know I mentioned again we are

585
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:09,470
just doing 2d gaming so we don't really

586
00:25:09,470 --> 00:25:13,790
need 3d so what do we do um it's really

587
00:25:13,790 --> 00:25:15,440
easy if you think about it and the

588
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,990
solution is mapping so just simply do

589
00:25:17,990 --> 00:25:21,350
alt 3d all 2d animations that you want

590
00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:24,860
to do you mapped into 3d animations but

591
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:28,160
not actually i'll change the layout you

592
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:31,190
actually transform it to translate 3d 10

593
00:25:31,190 --> 00:25:33,890
pixels and pixel and simply leave the

594
00:25:33,890 --> 00:25:37,190
set Z access so that's just what you do

595
00:25:37,190 --> 00:25:41,059
and all in all it just works so and

596
00:25:41,059 --> 00:25:42,920
bonus and this is what we're doing a lot

597
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:45,290
to you can use this for repositioning

598
00:25:45,290 --> 00:25:46,910
and animating so if you're moving a

599
00:25:46,910 --> 00:25:49,070
character on the screen don't actually

600
00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:51,830
change left and top but use translate 3d

601
00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:54,230
and it will be a lot faster on iphone

602
00:25:54,230 --> 00:25:56,870
and ipad and lon android so that's

603
00:25:56,870 --> 00:26:00,910
really something worth to consider

604
00:26:00,910 --> 00:26:03,740
server-side javascript i mentioned

605
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:05,150
before they were using javascript both

606
00:26:05,150 --> 00:26:07,850
on the server and the client i'm going

607
00:26:07,850 --> 00:26:09,110
to check really quickly while my time

608
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:15,170
looks ok i have to go quickly now so

609
00:26:15,170 --> 00:26:19,340
on people are asking me this right I

610
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:20,840
like the gaming industry guys at least

611
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:22,970
javis could pay for nothing ready now

612
00:26:22,970 --> 00:26:24,290
you want to work with it in the back end

613
00:26:24,290 --> 00:26:26,600
since most of the guys were released C++

614
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:31,730
guys so why did we choose JavaScript and

615
00:26:31,730 --> 00:26:33,740
I think it's pretty obvious for many of

616
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:35,840
you but still single scripting language

617
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,790
but project dramatically speeds up the

618
00:26:37,790 --> 00:26:39,830
development really like if you if you

619
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:42,020
have a single language in your team

620
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:44,300
that's just insanely off some and

621
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:46,730
insanely effective and create portions

622
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:48,320
simply can be reused so there's a lot of

623
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:51,020
lot of like the isometric functions that

624
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:53,690
we can reuse on decline in server so

625
00:26:53,690 --> 00:26:55,970
chaves cannily i love javascript i'm

626
00:26:55,970 --> 00:26:58,010
really a geek by heart so javascript is

627
00:26:58,010 --> 00:27:01,190
awesome um no chance I'm going to skip

628
00:27:01,190 --> 00:27:02,390
right through this because everyone

629
00:27:02,390 --> 00:27:06,290
knows no chase I guess search asking the

630
00:27:06,290 --> 00:27:10,520
browser javascript in node great

631
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:14,490
innovation obviously is event-driven

632
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:18,530
it's non blocking and this is a lot of

633
00:27:18,530 --> 00:27:20,360
the adventures that why we why we were

634
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:24,260
using no chairs for the prototypes io

635
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:27,470
API is also non blocking blocking roads

636
00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:29,660
non-blocking well we got that modules

637
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:33,380
atma script and now really cricket bonus

638
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:36,370
time if you do animating a lot of stuff

639
00:27:36,370 --> 00:27:39,290
there's a new property there's a new

640
00:27:39,290 --> 00:27:42,500
method in in Firefox Firefox nightly at

641
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:43,820
least which is called most

642
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:46,610
requestanimationframe it sounds really

643
00:27:46,610 --> 00:27:48,950
crazy but it's actually pretty useful so

644
00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:50,150
usually if you're animating in

645
00:27:50,150 --> 00:27:53,090
JavaScript what you do is you're using

646
00:27:53,090 --> 00:27:55,670
intervals and timeouts and if you're

647
00:27:55,670 --> 00:27:57,710
animating 50 people you're using 50 and

648
00:27:57,710 --> 00:28:01,250
develop and timeouts and chances are

649
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:03,650
dead for instance every second you're

650
00:28:03,650 --> 00:28:06,260
doing 500 of those rendering

651
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:07,850
calculations but you don't need to

652
00:28:07,850 --> 00:28:10,070
because the browser doesn't update in

653
00:28:10,070 --> 00:28:13,190
500 frames per second so if you're using

654
00:28:13,190 --> 00:28:15,260
Mosul requestanimationframe you're

655
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:17,270
basically doing it through events you're

656
00:28:17,270 --> 00:28:19,310
waiting for an event to fire and then

657
00:28:19,310 --> 00:28:21,740
triggering the next event so the browser

658
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:23,960
is actually controlling how much you can

659
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:25,170
render at a time

660
00:28:25,170 --> 00:28:29,540
so using those using that that interface

661
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:32,340
actually the browser is simply scaling

662
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:35,880
for you which is really nice mega bonus

663
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:41,070
time CSS animations well there CSS

664
00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:43,230
transitions I think most of them most of

665
00:28:43,230 --> 00:28:45,090
you know them already which just animate

666
00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:47,010
from one state to another support timing

667
00:28:47,010 --> 00:28:51,600
eating CSS animations are really more

668
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,670
effectively because you can control them

669
00:28:53,670 --> 00:28:55,830
they can have keyframes and you animate

670
00:28:55,830 --> 00:28:59,670
from 11 certain value to another one for

671
00:28:59,670 --> 00:29:01,560
instance they have unlimited steps and

672
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:04,740
you can use any CSS you can also trigger

673
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:07,140
them like a repeat them and start them

674
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:09,900
and stop them and they're really useful

675
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:11,850
for position animations or pacity

676
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:13,680
animations color animations and size

677
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:16,920
animations they're not useful for single

678
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:20,310
one and that is sprite animations so for

679
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:21,870
sprite animations and we were using

680
00:29:21,870 --> 00:29:23,610
those a lot like for instance if you if

681
00:29:23,610 --> 00:29:26,490
you're animating a walking character you

682
00:29:26,490 --> 00:29:28,200
actually have to do that through spite

683
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:31,890
animations and 2d games so sprite

684
00:29:31,890 --> 00:29:36,500
animations you can't actually do because

685
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:39,450
if you if you try to do spite animations

686
00:29:39,450 --> 00:29:42,420
with the key framing you define a couple

687
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:43,980
of background position values through

688
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:45,690
keyframes and then unfortunately

689
00:29:45,690 --> 00:29:48,120
everything between the keyframes get

690
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:50,490
interpolated so you see the background

691
00:29:50,490 --> 00:29:52,860
image sliding right so it's not just

692
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:54,690
jumping from one position to another

693
00:29:54,690 --> 00:29:57,120
like picture picture picture is actually

694
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:00,090
sliding through it so that kind of sucks

695
00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:01,260
and not that's not the impression that

696
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:05,550
we want and luckily this is really

697
00:30:05,550 --> 00:30:06,870
really hot and this is really really

698
00:30:06,870 --> 00:30:09,180
knew this just went into the specs

699
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:12,000
recently like a I think two weeks ago

700
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,340
three weeks ago it's not implemented in

701
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:15,870
any browser which is which is

702
00:30:15,870 --> 00:30:18,210
unfortunate but it really steps it's

703
00:30:18,210 --> 00:30:20,550
nice steps there's a new eating property

704
00:30:20,550 --> 00:30:22,680
is a new timing function so basically

705
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:24,540
what it does it it's not eating at all

706
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:27,630
it's actually disabling easing so if set

707
00:30:27,630 --> 00:30:29,940
keyframes are in fact behaving like

708
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:32,730
individual frames so with that you can

709
00:30:32,730 --> 00:30:34,610
actually control it you can actually

710
00:30:34,610 --> 00:30:38,370
control signal framing and I hope

711
00:30:38,370 --> 00:30:39,840
you can see some implementations soon i

712
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:42,050
know there's tickets already and then

713
00:30:42,050 --> 00:30:45,750
hopefully something is coming up so

714
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:48,210
that's it i think i'm right on time

715
00:30:48,210 --> 00:30:51,540
almost i also wanted to mention on

716
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:52,980
follow me on twitter if you want to see

717
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:56,130
new stuff coming up and also i'm here

another couple of guys we're hiring

722
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:07,080
we're looking for the best javascript

723
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:09,480
engineers and we have a lots of exciting

724
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:21,850
opportunities now thank

725
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:24,090
are there any questions left i think i

726
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:35,059
forgot to ask yeah one the engine oh

727
00:31:35,059 --> 00:31:38,610
well you know the engine is coming along

728
00:31:38,610 --> 00:31:41,490
quite well we're starting to do the real

729
00:31:41,490 --> 00:31:44,580
coding but as I mentioned like

730
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:46,259
unfortunately we will never see the day

731
00:31:46,259 --> 00:31:49,470
off light for other vendors and other

732
00:31:49,470 --> 00:31:52,039
companies because it will stay in zynga

733
00:31:52,039 --> 00:31:53,970
internally to build all the singer

734
00:31:53,970 --> 00:31:55,799
platform and single gaming experiences

735
00:31:55,799 --> 00:31:59,070
so if you're looking at middleware you

736
00:31:59,070 --> 00:32:00,419
probably have to jump on some

737
00:32:00,419 --> 00:32:03,470
competition can you move a bit forward I

738
00:32:03,470 --> 00:32:10,619
guess someone repeated which one impact

739
00:32:10,619 --> 00:32:15,749
is um oh yeah I've seen that one I've

740
00:32:15,749 --> 00:32:17,610
actually talked to the guy behind impact

741
00:32:17,610 --> 00:32:21,080
joyous and I actually wanted to hire him

742
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:26,490
he wasn't interested um but I love it I

743
00:32:26,490 --> 00:32:28,679

744
00:32:28,679 --> 00:32:30,690
growing and I and I think that's the

745
00:32:30,690 --> 00:32:32,580
best I can happen right now I always I

746
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:34,559

747
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:37,019

748
00:32:37,019 --> 00:32:38,909

749
00:32:38,909 --> 00:32:41,249
on gaming too like I want to see people

750
00:32:41,249 --> 00:32:43,529

752
00:32:45,389 --> 00:32:48,240
competition is awesome and I if you want

to do game engine please do so yeah

754
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:15,290
um i think i think i could get the

755
00:33:15,290 --> 00:33:19,299
question

756
00:33:19,309 --> 00:33:21,270
you

757
00:33:21,270 --> 00:33:27,039
you

758
00:33:27,049 --> 00:33:29,690
yeah I wondered about that too I I don't

759
00:33:29,690 --> 00:33:31,759
actually have a have an answer for that

760
00:33:31,759 --> 00:33:34,610
it sounds silly ain't but you know I

761
00:33:34,610 --> 00:33:37,820
know there's a nun q webkit I think

762
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:39,919
there's some some some guys who are

763
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:43,669
experimentally trying to to you know a

764
00:33:43,669 --> 00:33:45,889
hardware accelerate more than what is

765
00:33:45,889 --> 00:33:48,110
available right now like also the 2d

766
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:50,629
transformations and and animations as

767
00:33:50,629 --> 00:33:53,570
well I think it's coming I think it will

768
00:33:53,570 --> 00:34:01,869
eventually come and and yeah I guess so

769
00:34:01,869 --> 00:34:08,089
yeah yeah so I hope it will change soon

770
00:34:08,089 --> 00:34:11,980
yeah it's all very fresh stood alright
