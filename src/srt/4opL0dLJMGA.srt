00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:18,080

hello thank you so much for having me so

2
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:22,010
CSS is really really powerful tool you

3
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:24,200
can use it for art now you can use it to

4
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:26,210
do pixel manipulation here is an example

5
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:28,910
of a code pen where I'm generating these

6
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:31,070
random polka dots with the help of sass

7
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:33,320
random function every time you refresh

8
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:35,059
you get a sort of different aesthetic

9
00:00:35,059 --> 00:00:37,460
which is nice generative art you can do

10
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:38,690
things like this where you're just

11
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:40,520
playing with images applying different

12
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:42,140
filters and blend modes kind of like

13
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:44,449
lomography just seeing how creative you

14
00:00:44,449 --> 00:00:47,420
can get it's a really nice outlet you

15
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:50,180
can even create infrared effects so

16
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:52,730
faking this infrared camera effect you

17
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:54,590
don't need special equipment or tools or

18
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:56,660
even going out into the field and taking

19
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:59,390
photos when you can use CSS to recreate

20
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:04,040
these effects and you can create 3d

21
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:06,050
images through the images where you're

22
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:08,180
applying different blend modes putting

23
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:09,649
them on top of each other is seeing how

24
00:01:09,649 --> 00:01:12,020
they interact and creating these effects

25
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:13,759
sort of mimicking how the I can look at

26
00:01:13,759 --> 00:01:16,460
an image now that there's in the browser

27
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:18,110
you can really interact with them you

28
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:19,640
can apply animation to them you can make

29
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:21,920
3d animated videos if you wanted in the

30
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,930
browser it's all possible and it's

31
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:26,180
really cool if you want to see any more

32
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:27,560
information about these demos I

33
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:29,570
mentioned you can check out art the web

34
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:32,510
com which has posts that sort of detail

35
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:36,799
more of how to do those things but then

36
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:39,619
I get this when I give this talk and

37
00:01:39,619 --> 00:01:41,210
this woman is saying do you make money

38
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:43,430
from your art and the boy says yes and

39
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:49,340
she says really

40
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:51,550
so I want to show you how blend modes

41
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:53,979
are not just a little art piece that you

42
00:01:53,979 --> 00:01:56,229
can show off they can be implemented in

43
00:01:56,229 --> 00:01:58,390
your UIs and be a really nice way to add

44
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:00,070
a good touch to your projects and

45
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:04,240
websites so my name is Yuna and you can

46
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,250
find me on the internet at Yuna that's

47
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:08,860
pretty much everywhere github Twitter

48
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:11,500
I'm a UI engineer at digital ocean it's

49
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,930
a server company based in New York I

50
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:15,459
started a couple of sacks meetups that's

51
00:02:15,459 --> 00:02:17,440
how I got involved in the scene started

52
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,090
to austins asked me that but I started

53
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:21,370
the one in Washington DC back in the

54
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:23,950
states and I also co-host a podcast

55
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:26,440
called tools day where it's about 20 to

56
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,810
30 minutes of tech tool talk a week on

57
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:33,340
Tuesdays roughly at two p.m. EST so

58
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:36,760
let's start with filters filters are

59
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:39,610
really great and super super powerful so

60
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:42,730
with filters we have blur brightness

61
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:46,209
contrast drop shadow grayscale you

62
00:02:46,209 --> 00:02:49,870
rotate invert opacity sepia and saturate

63
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:52,239
and you can also combine any of these in

64
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:54,850
a space separated list in your CSS to

65
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:58,390
get multiple effects so a nice graphic

66
00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:00,280
of all of them up here you can see that

67
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,320
they take different values a lot of them

68
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:04,530
are 0 to 1 inclusive like grayscale

69
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:06,579
brightness you can go higher than one as

70
00:03:06,579 --> 00:03:08,980
well as contrast things like learning an

71
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:10,959
absolute value so an absolute pixel

72
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:13,329
value you can use ms don't use m's it'll

73
00:03:13,329 --> 00:03:14,560
break your browser if you do anything

74
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,510
higher than like 10 pixels it's really

75
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:18,760
bad you can use an argument list and

76
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,650
drop shadow so familiar with argument

77
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:23,519
lists that's that's what that looks like

78
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:25,660
so just in one line of code you can

79
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:28,840
really transform your page the browser

80
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,730
support is pretty good and the other

81
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:32,260
thing is since they're just visual

82
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:33,850
effects a lot of the time there are nice

83
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:35,140
bonus so with progressive enhancement

84
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:39,100
you can just add them on top here's an

85
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:41,140
example of just using it really quickly

86
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:44,500
one line in a website so I i wrote this

87
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,989
it's just a image from my blog drew

88
00:03:46,989 --> 00:03:49,180
these little sketches inside of an app

89
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:51,459
called paper and paper inherently has a

90
00:03:51,459 --> 00:03:53,799
gray background but instead of opening

91
00:03:53,799 --> 00:03:55,720
all of these images individually in

92
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:58,060
photoshop editing them putting them back

93
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:00,140
into my blog

94
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:02,330
I just added one line of code I don't

95
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:03,230
know if you could release it up there

96
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:04,069
but there was a difference between that

97
00:04:04,069 --> 00:04:05,780
background color and a foreground color

98
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:08,990
I just use a lightning filter liteon 1.1

99
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:11,330
and bam if using something auto prefix

100
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:12,560
or you don't even have to prefix the

101
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,420
WebKit but if you're not these do have a

102
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:17,959
WebKit prefix to them another example of

103
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:20,120
thing that you can do is this a really

104
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,919
common pattern that we see for focusing

105
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:24,890
attention on an area so a sidebar here

106
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:26,390
this is the Dolce and Gabbana website

107
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:28,340
and what they do is when you click that

108
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:31,010
sidebar open a div pops up with this

109
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:33,260
semi-transparent black background that

110
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:35,450
lays over the page and it focuses your

111
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:37,460
attention on that side bar but we can

112
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:38,930
recreate this with blend modes we don't

113
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:40,520
need to have the additional diff we

114
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:41,480
don't even need to have a background

115
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:44,510
color there is a property hopefully

116
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:46,850
we'll get meted called backdrop filter

117
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:49,640
and backdrop filter is really cool

118
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,350
because not only can we create this

119
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:54,050
effect that sort of has that darker

120
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:56,320
color in the background we can't blurs

121
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,790
since it's a filter we can use any of

122
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:00,890
those 10 filters so remember he wrote

123
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:03,440
eight is one of the options we can do

124
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,360
you know we can change the brightness

125
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,810
value any of that and get that same

126
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:10,340
effect but it's so interactive and we

127
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:11,210
can do it just directly in the browser

128
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:14,540
we can prototype right here so if I want

129
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:16,340
at a brightness that means I can also

130
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:18,350
make it darker if that brightness value

131
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:20,300
is less than 1 so we don't even need

132
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:21,500
that line of code to the background

133
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,240
don't need a background at all in one

134
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,550
line of CSS is backdrop filter we can

135
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:27,740
recreate this entire effect it's pretty

136
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:34,080
cool this browser support is pretty bad

137
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:37,430
it won't want however there are

138
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:39,620
workarounds there are hacks that let you

139
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:42,229
do this here is another example of this

140
00:05:42,229 --> 00:05:43,760
it allows that text to be much more

141
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,400
legible inside that modal window so it

142
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,930
has a light background but it's also

143
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:50,330
blurring that mountain image behind that

144
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:53,479
text so how do we recreate this in our

145
00:05:53,479 --> 00:05:55,640
current modern browsers how can we do

146
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:58,160
this it's called the fixed background

147
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,380
hack and it looks like this what you're

148
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:02,570
essentially doing is applying the same

149
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:04,700
background to the page and the element

150
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:06,740
that you want to fake that blur effect

151
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:11,660
so I have here this fixed background and

152
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:13,280
I have zero cover so it takes up the

153
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:13,920
entire

154
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,930
so whatever i'm revealing of that

155
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:18,570
background as i scroll will reveal the

156
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:21,150
same spot as the background of the page

157
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:23,340
so since that's an element that we've

158
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:25,140
added on top of that background we can

159
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:27,840
apply filters we can apply blur we can

160
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,120
apply a brightness filter take that text

161
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:32,280
more legible and it creates sort of that

162
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:34,620
same effect that same idea you can add

163
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:36,270
draggable to it like that previous

164
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:40,740
example in code pen and there we go you

165
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:43,050
can do things like revealing images so I

166
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:45,720
can hover over this and get whatever's

167
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:49,080
behind it you can do this with text so

168
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,550
making text more legible on top of

169
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:52,650
images if you had links or information

170
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:55,740
about speakers or users and it's really

171
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:57,300
easy to do this just in a couple of

172
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:59,220
lines of code you can apply this filter

173
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:01,500
this is you know using on a prefixed

174
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:02,700
here so it's going to add that WebKit

175
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:04,770
prefix and then add some content

176
00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:07,170
afterwards just in two divs have a

177
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:08,910
rapper and do within it and you have

178
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:11,190
created this effect which is a blur that

179
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:16,200
reveals some text as you hover on top so

180
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,910
another cool thing about filters is not

181
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:20,700
just is there a variety of options to

182
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:23,310
play with and choose from but you're

183
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:25,470
saving image requests with your hover

184
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:27,420
states with whatever active States focus

185
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:29,520
you want because you don't have to have

186
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,640
an image for your main view and a

187
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,930
separate image that you're downloading

188
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:36,150
onto your users site for that secondary

189
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:38,130
view you can just apply a filter to it

190
00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:40,770
and that's saving you a lot of memory if

191
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:43,200
you're not sending multiple images of

192
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:46,470
the same thing to your users so filters

193
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:47,730
can be really really useful in that

194
00:07:47,730 --> 00:07:50,160
sense and here's just a good example of

195
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,070
the variety that you can apply and

196
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:57,330
mixing some of them so filters are

197
00:07:57,330 --> 00:07:59,280
really cool but really what I think is

198
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,410
awesome about the web today is blend

199
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:04,800
modes blend modes how divs and colors

200
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,350
can interact on the web and this is

201
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:09,450
really really powerful there's a lot

202
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:12,360
more variety than the filters so here we

203
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,770
have all these options and I come in a

204
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:15,990
couple of groups dark and multiply and

205
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:17,430
color burn will all make those images

206
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:19,440
darker there's the Lightman group which

207
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,910
is lightning screen and color dodge

208
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:23,910
there's overlay soft light and hard

209
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:25,530
light then there's two that are kind of

210
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:27,060
similar which is difference in exclusion

211
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:29,340
and last four are all color properties

212
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:33,650
so hue saturation color and luminosity

213
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:36,479
browser support is decent on these so

214
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:38,250
keep that in mind there are two

215
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:39,810
different ways to apply them there's

216
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:41,700
background blend mode which applies

217
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:43,110
these to an element that has multiple

218
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:45,600
backgrounds so if I have an element with

219
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,760
a couple of different photo backgrounds

220
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,410
or a photo background and a color on it

221
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:51,660
then I can apply a background blend mode

222
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:53,130
to it and it mixes it with in that

223
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:56,220
element itself if i use a mixed blend

224
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:58,290
mode which has very similar supports

225
00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:00,510
very identical you're basically saying

226
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:02,400
that you want to mix that element with

227
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:05,550
the page around it so you guys an

228
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:08,400
example of using multiply on the right

229
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,320
we don't have it applied and on the left

230
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,880
over here we do have it applied it's

231
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:14,670
creating this really intense depth of

232
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:16,860
color because what it's doing is it's

233
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:19,680
taking each pixel value the luminosity

234
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,450
so that brightness value and it's

235
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:23,790
multiplying it it's like a transparency

236
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:25,529
if you shine a light through two

237
00:09:25,529 --> 00:09:27,540
transparencies the dark values will

238
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:29,730
remain was light values will shine right

239
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:31,380
through and any intermediate values will

240
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:33,240
mix and that's exactly what's happening

241
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,460
here so you can really see the depth of

242
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:37,140
these gradients that are occurring in

243
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:41,250
the CSS background multiplied can be

244
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:42,510
used throughout your site to really

245
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:44,550
unify it and bring in overall aesthetic

246
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:46,440
to it I like giving this example of this

247
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,570
bright yellow it makes the white text

248
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:50,400
somewhat let people on the stage who

249
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,500
would have known I'm using yellow and

250
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,330
white could work and it's a theme that

251
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:55,560
continues throughout the site without

252
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,420
detracting from it they're using black

253
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:59,370
and white images and this pop of color

254
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:03,450
by multiplying it um what's really cool

255
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:06,240
about CSS specifically is since it is in

256
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,250
the browser it is live you can interact

257
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:10,740
with it so your users can get the sense

258
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:12,360
of delight as they scroll through and

259
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,370
the page is changing and you can do this

260
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:16,950
in just a couple of lines of code it's

261
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:18,930
in effect that I think is pretty cool

262
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:23,130
and unique to the web today CSS comp did

263
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:25,050
a really good job of this so on their

264
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:26,700
website this is the CSS conf that's

265
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:28,950
happening in Boston this year they have

266
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:31,800
these SVG blobs these gradient SVG blobs

267
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:34,140
that sort of move with the page as you

268
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:35,700
scroll and also a wiggle around the page

269
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:37,350
so you can see that they're slowly

270
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:39,370
changing shape on this page

271
00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:40,750
and they're not really interfering with

272
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:42,640
the content they're adding to it they're

273
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,760
bringing a little bit of color to that

274
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:46,960
later down the page there overlapping

275
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:49,300
images you can also apply any of these

276
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:52,810
effects to images videos I mean so you

277
00:10:52,810 --> 00:10:54,640
can apply them on things that are moving

278
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,920
interactive and I'll give an example of

279
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:59,950
that in a moment so with this we can

280
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:01,960
also create designs like this and make

281
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,940
them possible in the browser and when

282
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:05,260
you make a design like this which I

283
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:07,089
found on dribbble possible in the

284
00:11:07,089 --> 00:11:09,460
browser you can make that accessible to

285
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:10,720
screen readers you can make it

286
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,180
searchable with search engines like

287
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:14,920
Google and your content is being

288
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:16,300
repeated on the page this becomes

289
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:18,550
content not just a JPEG that you had to

290
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:21,750
save out or a PNG which is pretty cool

291
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:24,550
we need to stop getting our inspiration

292
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:26,110
for websites from other websites and

293
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:28,360
this is something that I understand

294
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,740
happens for a reason people are really

295
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:32,050
focused on flat design which is great

296
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:33,820
for performance but now there are so

297
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:35,320
many more options with the web and how

298
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,839
CSS and HTML and JavaScript are

299
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:40,690
transforming that we can do better we

300
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:42,370
could get inspiration from fashion or

301
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:44,950
architecture illustration there's more

302
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:46,660
out there than just other websites to

303
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:48,370
take a look at I would love to see this

304
00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:50,910
trend of people experimenting war online

305
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:53,320
another example that i found on dribbble

306
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,990
that's a similar aesthetic is this one

307
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:58,450
so again you can recreate this in svgs

308
00:11:58,450 --> 00:12:01,120
and text instead of having to create a

309
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,730
separate PNG or JPEG that you're serving

310
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:08,050
to your users here's an example of the

311
00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:09,070
next blend node I want to talk about

312
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:10,839
which is the screen blend mode and

313
00:12:10,839 --> 00:12:14,620
screen is the total opposite of x I like

314
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:17,560
this example because it shows both so if

315
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:19,750
and multiply we are multiplying the

316
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:21,880
luminosity values of the pixels in

317
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:24,339
stream we are taking the inverse and

318
00:12:24,339 --> 00:12:26,320
multiplying the inverse the way that you

319
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,240
get the inverse of a pixel value as you

320
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,459
subtract it from one so instead of eight

321
00:12:30,459 --> 00:12:32,620
times VA being active layer B being the

322
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:34,690
background layer we are taking the

323
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:37,000
inverse of the active layers luminosity

324
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,520
value multiplying that by the inverse of

325
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:41,380
the background layers luminosity value

326
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:43,120
and then inverting all of that because

327
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,560
we're attracting both that from one and

328
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,029
that's how you're getting this affect

329
00:12:46,029 --> 00:12:47,920
your you're basically lightening up all

330
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,540
the parts that you would be darkening in

331
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:53,710
multiply an example i want to show you

332
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:55,060
how to really use this and make it

333
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:56,650
interactive in your sights it's with

334
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:59,170
this portrait so here's a portrait of a

335
00:12:59,170 --> 00:13:02,320
woman and say I wanted to apply an

336
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,900
interactive texture to it right so here

337
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:07,660
I have a video file because this is code

338
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:10,570
I can just go here and hit screen and

339
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:12,700
you have this instant video effects

340
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:15,970
created on your site again because this

341
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:18,490
is code I could just add some filters I

342
00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:20,590
could add a blur filter and make this

343
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:22,870
dynamic you can have this be interactive

344
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:25,750
with your users and to show that this is

345
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:28,090
just what it looks like so something

346
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:31,000
that is super super flexible they can

347
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
play with on the web also I wanted to

348
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,130
see what this looks like in a gif format

349
00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:38,470
so i recreated this exact same thing in

350
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:42,180
a gift as you can see it's kind of janky

351
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:44,620
he leaves a lot of the colors there and

352
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:47,080
also the file format size is incredibly

353
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:50,770
large so let's compare them we have the

354
00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:52,780
blend mode over here I know 3.6

355
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:54,640
megabytes sounds large it's a huge image

356
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,170
that I use for this presentation and an

357
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:58,420
MOV file that's pretty long definitely

358
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:00,130
can use better video formats and smaller

359
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:02,980
images but just in this is an example so

360
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:04,660
even though that's really big when I

361
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:08,080
convert it to a gift it was 24.7

362
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:10,420
megabytes nobody wants to serve that

363
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:12,280
nobody wants to pull that from the web

364
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:14,950
so there are a few ways that you can use

365
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:17,440
this to your benefit and make it much

366
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,560
more performant on your site this is a

367
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,090
really clever example of screens I

368
00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:23,470
wanted to share that I found online by

369
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:26,440
Yann Drewniak so he's creating this menu

370
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,840
where if you hover over you can see what

371
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,940
those icons are individually but

372
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:33,100
together it's just this really cute

373
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:37,180
little circle that sits on your page you

374
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:39,370
can also create text masks with mix

375
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:41,440
blend mode you can use the lighten and

376
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,330
darken blend modes or multiply in screen

377
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:44,890
I wouldn't recommend this because

378
00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:47,440
background sorry text clip is a little

379
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,630
bit more well supported and performance

380
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:51,670
than this but it is an option it's

381
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:53,410
something that people can play with and

382
00:14:53,410 --> 00:14:56,530
see online I really like this example

383
00:14:56,530 --> 00:15:00,670
this is a sort of profile view Emma

384
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:03,280
Watson and she has this sort of gray to

385
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:05,470
blue gradient applied on top of her if

386
00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:06,610
you could see that

387
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:08,290
and this is lightened and you can tell

388
00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:09,820
that's lightened because in the dark

389
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:13,480
areas we lose a lot of the detail and it

390
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:15,040
kind of just makes it a little bit more

391
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,620
murky I really like this effect I think

392
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:20,079
it's a very unifying effect so the way

393
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:21,850
that works is if we want to take this

394
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:23,620
color like this pink color and lighten

395
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:26,560
it by this blue shade we get this nice

396
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,750
purple and it just does it first in the

397
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:31,779
browser so you can look at it pretty

398
00:15:31,779 --> 00:15:35,620
simply if you remember that black is RGB

399
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:41,200
0 0 0 and white is 255 255 255 right so

400
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,670
when we're lightening it we're looking

401
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:44,589
at each of these RGB values and

402
00:15:44,589 --> 00:15:47,110
comparing them which ones lighter 190 or

403
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:50,680
40 it's one I need what about the green

404
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:53,709
valley which one flight 2501 6160

405
00:15:53,709 --> 00:15:55,810
exactly and then 240 and if you see

406
00:15:55,810 --> 00:15:57,670
what's happening here that's how we get

407
00:15:57,670 --> 00:16:00,040
this purple value at the end it's pretty

408
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:01,630
cool so it's dark and you're doing the

409
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:02,890
opposite where you're looking for that

410
00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:05,829
smaller value closer to dark colors like

411
00:16:05,829 --> 00:16:09,160
black and that's doing the same thing

412
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:12,550
comparing those values the next thing I

413
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:14,740
want to talk about is sort of on the

414
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:16,269
topic of this effect because it is my

415
00:16:16,269 --> 00:16:19,060
favorite one so using lighten you can

416
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:21,190
create this sort of faded out vintage

417
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:23,019
the effect that can really unify page

418
00:16:23,019 --> 00:16:25,000
and we're seeing this more commonly in

419
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,060
design and on the web so it looks like

420
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:30,730
this losing some of those detail in the

421
00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:33,010
shadow and applying serve a wash over

422
00:16:33,010 --> 00:16:36,670
this image the way you do it here i'm

423
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:38,320
using the background blend mode property

424
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:41,980
and two background images on that that

425
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:44,079
page so i have a color applied and that

426
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:46,230
background which is just the image link

427
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:49,060
basically i want to mix background of

428
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:51,130
lighten or the background blend mode of

429
00:16:51,130 --> 00:16:53,949
lighten and then choose the darkest

430
00:16:53,949 --> 00:16:55,720
color i want on that page so if i want

431
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:56,860
the darkest color to be that bright

432
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:58,449
yellow you can throw it all the way up

433
00:16:58,449 --> 00:16:59,680
there to wash everything out that's

434
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,140
darker than it if I want to be like a

435
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:04,750
nice navy grey or a purple that this is

436
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:08,319
perfect for that so here's an example of

437
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:09,910
that so do a tone effect you can see

438
00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:11,949
again in those shadows that you're

439
00:17:11,949 --> 00:17:14,970
losing some of that color the shopify ad

440
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:18,040
campaign that came out for their year

441
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:18,670
interview

442
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:21,400
you sort of end of year you're in music

443
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,260
I thought was really cool like beautiful

444
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:25,330
colors really cool blend modes applied

445
00:17:25,330 --> 00:17:26,920
and just mash together in a really nice

446
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:30,010
way okay so the next time I want to talk

447
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:32,050
about is the color blend mode and color

448
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:33,910
is really cool I mean here I'm going to

449
00:17:33,910 --> 00:17:36,190
use this dog to show you I'm going to

450
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:39,220
overlap and then apply color so

451
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:42,100
basically what color is doing is it is

452
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:44,800
taking the hue value and the saturation

453
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,960
value of the active layer so the rainbow

454
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,240
colors and applying that to the

455
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:51,970
luminosity the dark and light values of

456
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:54,280
that dog behind it so that dog could be

457
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:56,080
black and white and have that color

458
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,190
applied to it and you would never know

459
00:17:57,190 --> 00:17:59,350
it wouldn't make a difference whatever

460
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:01,180
color on tap you want to apply it's

461
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:03,220
taking those two values if you look at

462
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:05,410
this sort of ring of color you have

463
00:18:05,410 --> 00:18:07,330
luminosity which again is your dark to

464
00:18:07,330 --> 00:18:09,580
light value you have your hue so that

465
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:11,410
shade on the color wheel and then you

466
00:18:11,410 --> 00:18:14,020
have how far away that color is from

467
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:15,730
fifty percent gray which is the

468
00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:18,460
saturation and these are all their own

469
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:20,800
individual blend modes so you can apply

470
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,960
just luminosity of a color or an image

471
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:26,320
or a gradient to an image behind it it

472
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:27,910
will just take lightning light and dark

473
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:29,560
values you can apply just a saturation

474
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:31,750
of it or you can apply just the hue

475
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:34,750
value of it which allows for a lot of

476
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:38,230
different combination on the web here's

477
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:40,480
an example of that color applied to an

478
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,100
image behind it don't know if this image

479
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:43,420
is colored don't know if it's black and

480
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:45,430
white probably a smaller file size to

481
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:46,810
send if you're sending a black and white

482
00:18:46,810 --> 00:18:49,000
image and it's just apply on this page

483
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,190
gives it a wash of color makes that text

484
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:53,140
a little bit more legible as well and

485
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:55,470
just gives it a nice overall effect I

486
00:18:55,470 --> 00:18:57,850
spoke at a conference last month where

487
00:18:57,850 --> 00:19:01,150
they use this icon system where they use

488
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:03,280
the stately a similar color of pink for

489
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,110
all the icons it was a nice way they're

490
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:06,340
sort of blend and bring the page

491
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:08,320
together for the intro video here they

492
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,210
did the same thing it's a nice unifying

493
00:19:10,210 --> 00:19:11,950
effect because everyone's photos are

494
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:13,950
going to have different shades in them

495
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:16,840
and I was scrolling along the speaker

496
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:18,370
page and looking at all the speakers

497
00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:19,780
thinking about okay so what are the tux

498
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:22,570
is going to be I noticed that one of the

499
00:19:22,570 --> 00:19:26,100
speakers didn't have the color applied

500
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:28,810
it was just sort of missing I thought

501
00:19:28,810 --> 00:19:31,700
well if we had you know CSS this

502
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:33,740
really easy cascading change to make

503
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:35,630
just in case this ever happens you don't

504
00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:37,309
even have to open any of those images in

505
00:19:37,309 --> 00:19:39,049
Photoshop and edit them manually you can

506
00:19:39,049 --> 00:19:41,570
apply a single class to them and have

507
00:19:41,570 --> 00:19:43,309
them all get that effect throughout the

508
00:19:43,309 --> 00:19:46,429
entire page so we can do here is use

509
00:19:46,429 --> 00:19:48,529
color I'll use that color blend mode

510
00:19:48,529 --> 00:19:50,570
create this pseudo element this after

511
00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:52,279
soo development to sit on top of the

512
00:19:52,279 --> 00:19:55,639
image and because we're doing this in

513
00:19:55,639 --> 00:19:57,260
the browser we can even open up devtools

514
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:59,360
and see what's color we like the best

515
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,580
this is like prototyping in the browser

516
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:03,289
instantly as fast as you can do it

517
00:20:03,289 --> 00:20:05,419
wherever you are presenting your site to

518
00:20:05,419 --> 00:20:08,029
your users so then you have this uniform

519
00:20:08,029 --> 00:20:11,809
effect throughout your site but you know

520
00:20:11,809 --> 00:20:13,880
you got to be wary of browser

521
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,409
differences maybe not all browsers

522
00:20:15,409 --> 00:20:18,200
support this sort of thing and if you

523
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:20,179
think about it what we just did was we

524
00:20:20,179 --> 00:20:22,580
applied a block of color on top of this

525
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:24,679
image of a person so if the browser

526
00:20:24,679 --> 00:20:26,809
doesn't support blend modes you're just

527
00:20:26,809 --> 00:20:29,029
going to see a block of color we can

528
00:20:29,029 --> 00:20:31,159
mitigate this thing to embrace the

529
00:20:31,159 --> 00:20:34,610
Cascade we can mitigate this by using

530
00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:36,649
one of those hue saturation luminosity

531
00:20:36,649 --> 00:20:39,289
values we can create the same pseudo

532
00:20:39,289 --> 00:20:41,659
element this after pseudo element put it

533
00:20:41,659 --> 00:20:44,799
behind the image apply a luminosity

534
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:47,779
blend mode of the image on top of the

535
00:20:47,779 --> 00:20:50,269
color and so that is going to apply the

536
00:20:50,269 --> 00:20:52,010
lightness and darkness values of the

537
00:20:52,010 --> 00:20:54,200
image to the color behind it so if the

538
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,029
browser doesn't support blend modes

539
00:20:56,029 --> 00:20:58,970
you'll still see the original image so

540
00:20:58,970 --> 00:21:00,230
that's sort of how you take the inverse

541
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:02,149
of color and you are applying it in this

542
00:21:02,149 --> 00:21:05,389
manner you can still edit this with

543
00:21:05,389 --> 00:21:07,519
color throughout with your dev tools and

544
00:21:07,519 --> 00:21:09,350
see what shades you like what you get

545
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:10,970
interact with it it all works the same

546
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:16,100
way so if you have an idea in mind here

547
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:18,169
the streak rating Instagram filters you

548
00:21:18,169 --> 00:21:20,059
can really create anything and the way

549
00:21:20,059 --> 00:21:21,679
that you can recreate any sort of filter

550
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:23,750
effect is through gradients because

551
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:26,029
gradients allow you to create multiple

552
00:21:26,029 --> 00:21:28,789
blocks of color on a single plane and

553
00:21:28,789 --> 00:21:29,990
that means you don't have to have

554
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:31,789
multiple divs to create these elements I

555
00:21:31,789 --> 00:21:34,490
really like this idea of recreating i

556
00:21:34,490 --> 00:21:36,740
just used instagram as an example but

557
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:38,419
figuring out how those gradients can

558
00:21:38,419 --> 00:21:40,159
interact and work so here i have a

559
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:41,960
radial gradient some of the filters

560
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:44,370
didn't even need a blend mode

561
00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:46,290
so here I have just a color a solid

562
00:21:46,290 --> 00:21:47,910
color with a few different filters

563
00:21:47,910 --> 00:21:50,280
applied so you can go through and really

564
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:52,470
use that as a baseline to compare and

565
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:56,100
create so create this open-source

566
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:58,380
project called CSS Graham which has a

567
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:00,480
variety of these filters applied and

568
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,220
they do have animatable properties

569
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:04,800
somewhat to them and it's totally

570
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,180
available open source if you want to

571
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:07,380
contribute if you want to grab this

572
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:09,690
available via CDN and apply it to your

573
00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:12,960
images I've seen it in videos I've seen

574
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,790
it there's a coffee shop that has like a

575
00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:16,410
little Minneapolis anything is this

576
00:22:16,410 --> 00:22:18,450
which is pretty cool um but just

577
00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:20,910
experiment and explore CSS Graham is not

578
00:22:20,910 --> 00:22:22,740
the only thing out there there is now

579
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:27,030
vscocam which is CSS Co the CSS version

580
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:29,070
of it it uses the visco camp images and

581
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:31,080
recreates those and there's this one

582
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:32,780
that I think is pretty cool and unique

583
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:35,760
color filter which is same idea but

584
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:38,040
they're kind of returning that bright

585
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:41,280
Spotify effect and the URL is sort of

586
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,690
long so if you want to go back to this

587
00:22:42,690 --> 00:22:44,309
one I would take a picture of it but

588
00:22:44,309 --> 00:22:46,050
lucky video duck it helped that I 0 /

589
00:22:46,050 --> 00:22:48,000
color filter you could write that

590
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,600
dentally fast so next I'm I want to talk

591
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,250
about is a mix of a few blend modes and

592
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:55,350
that is the overlay blend mode so here

593
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:57,870
you can see that applied to the text of

594
00:22:57,870 --> 00:22:59,820
that calculator and overlay is

595
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:01,530
interesting because it takes to the

596
00:23:01,530 --> 00:23:03,300
screen blend mode and the multiply blend

597
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:05,280
mode applies the screen blend mode to

598
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,200
the light values at fifty percent and

599
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,920
the dark values get the x 1 mode applied

600
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:13,830
and it really makes us like nice sort of

601
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:16,110
not dramatic effect looks like this

602
00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:19,170
closer up the calculator as it's darker

603
00:23:19,170 --> 00:23:21,450
on top the numbers on our darker and

604
00:23:21,450 --> 00:23:23,309
lighter ones are lighter so it creates

605
00:23:23,309 --> 00:23:25,860
like a little smooth effect a little bit

606
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:27,840
better seen here in this border so in

607
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,760
the light values it's it's lightning

608
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,380
that image by the same percentage as it

609
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:33,179
is in the dark values so instead of just

610
00:23:33,179 --> 00:23:34,980
like a white border around it it makes a

611
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:39,960
more unified visualization all right so

612
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,850
the difference blood mode the best way I

613
00:23:41,850 --> 00:23:43,890
like to explain this is with these

614
00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:45,750
little games do you remember these games

615
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:48,990
from childhood can you spot the

616
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:51,480
differences between a number one number

617
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:58,070
two well the CSS we can just keep

618
00:23:58,070 --> 00:24:01,590
so what difference does is it looks at

619
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:04,050
all the pixel values it looks at the

620
00:24:04,050 --> 00:24:06,840
difference between all the colors RGB

621
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:08,610
and a from the active layer and

622
00:24:08,610 --> 00:24:10,170
background layer and takes absolute

623
00:24:10,170 --> 00:24:12,930
value so with difference similar pixels

624
00:24:12,930 --> 00:24:15,570
will turn black with exclusion they'll

625
00:24:15,570 --> 00:24:17,760
turn that fifty percent gray and this is

626
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,350
really used for lining up transparencies

627
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:20,490
in the past making sure they were

628
00:24:20,490 --> 00:24:21,900
perfectly aligned and I'll show you why

629
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:24,960
I hover over this you can see oh we're

630
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,730
cheating those are all the answers all

631
00:24:26,730 --> 00:24:33,330
the differences so Sarah drives are

632
00:24:33,330 --> 00:24:35,760
capable this idea of visual regression

633
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,770
testing with the difference blend mode

634
00:24:37,770 --> 00:24:39,120
because you can just look at your before

635
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,250
look here after apply one line of code

636
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:43,950
and see what the differences are pretty

637
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:46,920
cool took that idea and sort of expanded

638
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:48,900
on it and created this site called

639
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:51,570
Tiffany which allows you to do visual

640
00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:54,300
regression testing in your browser with

641
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:57,540
CSS just one line of CSS code works

642
00:24:57,540 --> 00:24:59,100
locally because just behind your

643
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:00,180
firewall if you want to compare a

644
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:01,980
staging site to anything you have local

645
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:04,770
or an active site and see what visual

646
00:25:04,770 --> 00:25:07,110
regression you've introduced into that

647
00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:13,350
site CSS pretty cool so in review CSS is

648
00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:18,230
awesome we all do that when it works

649
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:23,100
that's the caveat so don't do these

650
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:25,290
things because you know browser supports

651
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:26,760
not fully there yet if you really need

652
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,830
to support older browsers not highly

653
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:32,250
recommend this if you do need to support

654
00:25:32,250 --> 00:25:33,630
other browsers and you want to try the

655
00:25:33,630 --> 00:25:35,610
blend modes consider the ordering of

656
00:25:35,610 --> 00:25:37,290
your divs and your images because it's

657
00:25:37,290 --> 00:25:39,570
still really possible to apply this and

658
00:25:39,570 --> 00:25:41,520
progressively enhance your website to

659
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:45,300
use these effects performance it is

660
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:48,300
still faster to use a pre edited image

661
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:50,130
that you're sending to your page rather

662
00:25:50,130 --> 00:25:53,340
than edit them on the page itself

663
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:55,230
because you have to paint that image and

664
00:25:55,230 --> 00:25:56,970
then apply the filter so you have to

665
00:25:56,970 --> 00:25:58,650
repaint it repaint the pixels on top of

666
00:25:58,650 --> 00:26:00,270
that your browser is doing calculation

667
00:26:00,270 --> 00:26:01,890
so there's a little bit of a performance

668
00:26:01,890 --> 00:26:04,980
hit to this you also can't save the

669
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:06,660
images which could be a good thing

670
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:08,160
depending on if you want your users to

671
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:10,170
grab your images but if somebody right

672
00:26:10,170 --> 00:26:11,010
clicks and save

673
00:26:11,010 --> 00:26:12,180
it they're going to get the unfiltered

674
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:14,850
unedited version of that rather than the

675
00:26:14,850 --> 00:26:16,520
nice filter that you applied on the page

676
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:18,960
unless they take a screenshot of course

677
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:22,950
and there's no thumbnail support so what

678
00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:24,660
I mean by this is if you hear it on

679
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:26,910
Twitter or Facebook people can see your

680
00:26:26,910 --> 00:26:28,620
content but they're not going to see the

681
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:30,000
filter that you applied to it because

682
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,580
it's not native to the page so consider

683
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:35,940
that as well but do try this because

684
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:38,040
performance I know I just said this and

685
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:40,830
they don't try this category but um we

686
00:26:40,830 --> 00:26:42,990
did show how it is good for performance

687
00:26:42,990 --> 00:26:44,910
in terms of that video if you wanted to

688
00:26:44,910 --> 00:26:46,230
make something really dynamic there are

689
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:48,000
certain cases where this is a lot better

690
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,820
in performance that one was a big one

691
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:51,750
also you don't have to send multiple

692
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:53,520
image requests so that could be a place

693
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,890
where if you look at sort of what you

694
00:26:55,890 --> 00:26:57,360
gain and what you lose from doing these

695
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,340
filters you probably will gain a lot

696
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:01,200
more if you're sending two images to

697
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,240
your user for your hover effects or

698
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:07,410
focus effects flexibility hovering

699
00:27:07,410 --> 00:27:09,810
interacting this provides for a lot of

700
00:27:09,810 --> 00:27:11,700
interaction on the web natively you

701
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:12,870
don't have to use JavaScript for this

702
00:27:12,870 --> 00:27:16,050
it's really cool I'm consistency so

703
00:27:16,050 --> 00:27:18,360
embracing that cascade allowing for all

704
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:20,370
those styles to be generated from one

705
00:27:20,370 --> 00:27:22,490
bit of code keeping your code really dry

706
00:27:22,490 --> 00:27:25,290
speed of prototyping because we can do

707
00:27:25,290 --> 00:27:27,210
this directly in our browser we don't

708
00:27:27,210 --> 00:27:30,300
have to worry about doing in Photoshop

709
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:31,800
sang into the developer having them

710
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:33,090
apply it you can just work with

711
00:27:33,090 --> 00:27:34,950
designers sitting next to each other

712
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:37,050
doing pair design pair programming and

713
00:27:37,050 --> 00:27:38,520
sort of figure out what you want on the

714
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:39,630
spot which is great for those

715
00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:41,760
last-minute changes to always happen

716
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:44,790
always happen but it's nice you can see

717
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:46,350
it directly in the medium which you're

718
00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:49,110
presenting accessibility for those

719
00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:51,720
artistic designs not just accessibility

720
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:53,610
with text and screen readers but

721
00:27:53,610 --> 00:27:55,710
allowing that to be searchable by web

722
00:27:55,710 --> 00:27:57,840
search engines making your site a lot

723
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:02,280
more semantic and exploration this is a

724
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:05,190
big thing the ability to sort of explore

725
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:08,880
with coming up in CSS and seeing what we

726
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,980
can do to push that further because the

727
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:12,660
only way to push the web forward is to

728
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:14,810
build something that pushes the web and

729
00:28:14,810 --> 00:28:17,310
using things that push the web is how we

730
00:28:17,310 --> 00:28:21,060
can do that so this is sort of like an

731
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:23,190
awesome website it's called evolution of

732
00:28:23,190 --> 00:28:24,900
the web and here we can see sorta

733
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:27,290
we're technologies have come in and go

734
00:28:27,290 --> 00:28:31,320
and right there is CSS animation and

735
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:34,340
it's kind of hard to see it's pretty new

736
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:36,570
flexbox is also really really new in

737
00:28:36,570 --> 00:28:38,940
comparison to all this the filters are

738
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:41,580
like baby they're like toddler stage you

739
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:43,710
know but they're brand new so browsers

740
00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:45,780
are still really really working on

741
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:47,220
implementing these making them really

742
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:49,890
perform it in the browser and so now is

743
00:28:49,890 --> 00:28:51,480
the time to sort of explore and see what

744
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:52,830
we can do with them and help the

745
00:28:52,830 --> 00:28:56,070
browsers open bugs there's a big queue

746
00:28:56,070 --> 00:28:57,870
they can really participate with like

747
00:28:57,870 --> 00:29:00,720
Mozilla tweet at browsers they often

748
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,160
will like reply and say okay we're

749
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,620
working on this or tree off it that way

750
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:06,120
there was like a little trend lately

751
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:08,340
that was like hashtag edge bugs they

752
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:11,120
could tweet at them pretty pretty cool

753
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:14,850
so be an explorer and art the web try

754
00:29:14,850 --> 00:29:17,620
