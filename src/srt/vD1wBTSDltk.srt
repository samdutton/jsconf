00:00:00,979 --> 00:00:06,509

okay so introductions I'm Marcus

2
00:00:06,509 --> 00:00:08,400
Phillips I'm from hack reactor we're

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,320
almost goal teaching people to be

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,559
professional developers in 12 weeks so

5
00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:15,929
every seven weeks a new group of people

6
00:00:15,929 --> 00:00:18,060
shows up and we go through a lot of this

7
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:21,420
fundamental material and I've seen a lot

8
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:23,070
of people experience the same stuff over

9
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:24,539
and over again so I'm going to be kind

10
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:26,279
of guessing and anticipating what it is

11
00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:28,680
that you are confused by as it happens

12
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:30,510
you've just come to the easiest session

13
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:33,360
of the entire week the secession is

14
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,420
incredibly easy it's know how do you

15
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:40,440
know node is just stunningly alarmingly

16
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,960
straightforward it is so simple for a

17
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,210
long time I thought known was like uh I

18
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:47,160
don't even know what I imagined it to be

19
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:49,739
it was budu for sure it was really

20
00:00:49,739 --> 00:00:51,750
intimidating and I thought in colleges

21
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:53,640
complex I don't even know people said no

22
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,800
lots of passion denim I'm not sure

23
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,629
what's happening anymore one day I got

24
00:00:57,629 --> 00:00:59,670
to sit down and learn note when I sat

25
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:02,430
down to learn note I you know I actively

26
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:04,170
researched it and try to figure it out

27
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:06,420
understand it and it got really got more

28
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:09,030
and more complex and sprawling until

29
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:11,810
finally I struck on what it really was

30
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:14,340
it's about one sense long what know it

31
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:18,030
is and that's all you need enough so

32
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:19,200
here's the sentence you're welcome to

33
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,060
walk up at Liam what I'm done node is

34
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:26,250
JavaScript it's not running in your

35
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:29,549
browser that's it let me just show you

36
00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:33,940
some JavaScript running in a browser

37
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:40,110
let's go to the jsf website open up the

38
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:44,220
chrome console and say I don't know

39
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:49,680
three plus three good to know so

40
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,509
JavaScript running in my console and my

41
00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:52,829
browser we're all very familiar with

42
00:01:52,829 --> 00:01:57,030
this seems reasonable someone at one

43
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:00,000
point said okay maybe I want to get

44
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,010
access to

45
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:02,780
move some more stuff browse and puts you

46
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:04,880
in this little box maybe I want access

47
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:10,450
to some of that stuff sure maybe I want

48
00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:13,130
baby I want to run JavaScript from the

49
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:15,230
hand line as a cron job raise your hand

50
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:18,260
if you've ever used to prom okay so

51
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:20,120
there you go you're working in the

52
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:23,890
command line you want to run JavaScript

53
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:34,420
type node boom tellin everybody go so

54
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:36,710
for whatever reason known has

55
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:39,200
accumulated this this steep as being a

56
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:43,160
really rich complicated thing and in

57
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:45,470
fact the ecosystem around node is pretty

58
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:47,660
nuanced and interesting but as a

59
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:50,240
fundamental concept if you're in the

60
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,100
room thinking I don't know what no it is

61
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:53,420
I don't know how it works on what I'm

62
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:56,150
doing believe it or not you're basically

63
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:58,550
done what I'm going to do next and this

64
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:01,220
is mainly going to be a mainly going to

65
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:03,740
be a quick demo followed by you guys

66
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:05,870
trying to do whatever brings you to this

67
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:08,150
room you go you start working on that

68
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:10,220
stuff again and our TAS will circulate

69
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:12,350
and try to help solve any problems

70
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:14,090
you're actually having on the basis of

71
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:18,860
having this orientation to them so the

72
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:20,840
slight differences that you're going to

73
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:26,690
encounter our a how you define files

74
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:30,080
right so in in the browser you make a

75
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,750
script file in imported using HTML tag

76
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:36,769
in node I hope it's all right that I use

77
00:03:36,769 --> 00:03:41,840
Emacs no no you can't tell what's going

78
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,610
on there I'll Swiss something that has a

79
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:48,320
mouse and embarrass myself if I Emacs a

80
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:54,470
file like hello world James I can type

81
00:03:54,470 --> 00:04:09,050
you know three plus three council blog

82
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:13,680
and console that log for poor just write

83
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:18,329
some random code and close it out and I

84
00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:20,070
know just like I did before but I typed

85
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:24,990
it into the file hello world it does the

86
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:29,400
work that that code specifies a couple

87
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,810
of existing things where does the

88
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:32,850
console go while it goes into your

89
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:36,090
terminal what happened to the work that

90
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:38,280
I couldn't that didn't count becomes a

91
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:41,550
walk it got done the answer was computed

92
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:44,700
and in this case grown away but if you

93
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:47,010
can write JavaScript in any environment

94
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:51,000
you can write JavaScript it up so there

95
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,919
are some aspects of node that were

96
00:04:52,919 --> 00:04:55,680
fundamentally differently the first is

97
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,620
how do you include other five how to

98
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:03,300
include files in the browser how do you

99
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:06,240
get one file of JavaScript to run there

100
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:11,220
had to be available to another five it's

101
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:12,660
a reference it with this script tag

102
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:16,470
right close you're correct but I'll

103
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:18,360
expand on your language to fully

104
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:21,539
specified you use script tags and in the

105
00:05:21,539 --> 00:05:23,820
browser you have to specify you have to

106
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:27,539
include one script and then trust that

107
00:05:27,539 --> 00:05:29,310
all of that code will have been executed

108
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:32,340
and hopefully it mutates the global

109
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:36,390
scope and then immediately after that in

110
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:38,970
the HTML file you write another script

111
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:41,820
and this new script will run in the same

112
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:44,460
global scope the fact that both files

113
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:46,380
run in one global scope is the only

114
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:48,620
point of interaction those two files get

115
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:51,570
this is kind of problematic you can't

116
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:54,240
for example happy where you can't write

117
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,510
a javascript file for the browser that

118
00:05:57,510 --> 00:06:00,129
says and by the way i want this other

119
00:06:00,129 --> 00:06:01,989
javascript file to run first you can't

120
00:06:01,989 --> 00:06:03,759
use strip dependency management in

121
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:07,119
vanilla JavaScript you can't specify the

122
00:06:07,119 --> 00:06:09,639
pendency in one screw in one file upon

123
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:15,759
another body you can't get that indicate

124
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:18,099
you can't get code to run and receive

125
00:06:18,099 --> 00:06:22,959
the results as an input to a file as

126
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:24,789
something that only that file will have

127
00:06:24,789 --> 00:06:26,319
access to it will have a local name for

128
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,719
that for that dependency that doesn't

129
00:06:28,719 --> 00:06:30,489
work either it is all the mobile scope

130
00:06:30,489 --> 00:06:32,559
every file that runs in the global scope

131
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:36,189
in the browser has access to the same

132
00:06:36,189 --> 00:06:37,929
global area so they all just sort of

133
00:06:37,929 --> 00:06:39,099
willy nilly right to the global

134
00:06:39,099 --> 00:06:41,050
namespace and hope they don't trample on

135
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:42,490
each other and hope they run in the

136
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:44,439
right order this is the challenge that

137
00:06:44,439 --> 00:06:46,869
we face in the browser people have

138
00:06:46,869 --> 00:06:47,830
written some pretty good tools for

139
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:50,860
getting around that when hope started

140
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:52,479
writing known and saying we would like

141
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:55,539
to be we'd like this to be easier we

142
00:06:55,539 --> 00:06:57,189
would like to be an easier story buried

143
00:06:57,189 --> 00:07:01,029
porting hope they invented a syntax that

144
00:07:01,029 --> 00:07:04,749
we use with required than exports so

145
00:07:04,749 --> 00:07:06,849
let's take a look at that let's emacs

146
00:07:06,849 --> 00:07:11,429
hello world again let's say I wanted

147
00:07:11,429 --> 00:07:15,039
underscore let's say I have a copy of

148
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:17,229
underscore in fact I can download that

149
00:07:17,229 --> 00:07:28,270
briefly no that's right that's right

150
00:07:28,280 --> 00:08:11,570
r

151
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:25,180
ok

152
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:40,420
students

153
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:49,229
export study exports

154
00:08:49,239 --> 00:08:54,649
go so in this file this is the

155
00:08:54,649 --> 00:08:57,679
underscore file I've got the source code

156
00:08:57,679 --> 00:09:01,759
for underscore approximately and because

157
00:09:01,759 --> 00:09:08,179
i want i want the each function to be

158
00:09:08,179 --> 00:09:10,339
available as part of the package that

159
00:09:10,339 --> 00:09:12,769
i'm exporting I make the each function a

160
00:09:12,769 --> 00:09:15,529
property of the exports object if courts

161
00:09:15,529 --> 00:09:18,019
object one of the things that note gives

162
00:09:18,019 --> 00:09:21,290
us to facilitate code being shared

163
00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:26,929
between files exports is the objects

164
00:09:26,929 --> 00:09:28,399
that will be made available to other

165
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:30,379
files when they require that thought

166
00:09:30,379 --> 00:09:34,269
let's go to another file and say far

167
00:09:34,269 --> 00:09:37,189
underscore let's give them more than

168
00:09:37,189 --> 00:09:42,889
equals require dot slash underscore I'm

169
00:09:42,889 --> 00:09:45,259
using dot slash because I mean it is in

170
00:09:45,259 --> 00:09:53,730
the same folder so let's give it a shot

171
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:57,280
did it work we can't quite tell yet it

172
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:59,680
didn't fail didn't throw an error let's

173
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:07,330
log in log the underscore object that I

174
00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:10,780
got back it seems to be an object that

175
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:13,990
has a each function on it right so this

176
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:15,370
is how you're going to write two files

177
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:17,890
of your own code that depend on want to

178
00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:21,070
know are there any questions about how

179
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:26,740
you to do this goal but I don't want to

180
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:29,500
write out this for myself I want someone

181
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,600
else to write it and then I just want to

182
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,630
download so instead what I'm going to do

183
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:37,360
is take off this dot slash and that says

184
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,780
to note please give me the copy of

185
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:43,240
underscore that is in my packages in my

186
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:46,060
package management system summer let's

187
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:51,200
see if it works this will only work if

188
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:56,200
waiting

189
00:10:56,210 --> 00:11:01,920
exactly so I've taken off dot slash to

190
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,050
clarify it suddenly naval undersea about

191
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:08,040
uh no that means facing express what

192
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:10,800
express I probably have a quick

193
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:17,010
statement heck they don't what is no no

194
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:22,020
Dale patty spelling one word unveiling

195
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:26,270
cool so I can require known mailer and

196
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:29,070
we know that I don't have closely so I

197
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:31,800
can't say dot slash I'd like to do taste

198
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:35,250
that i use a package from a hacked

199
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:37,620
management when I run hello world it's

200
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:41,790
like I don't know that so I have to

201
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:45,450
install a package I have two out I can

202
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:46,770
either install a locally to this project

203
00:11:46,770 --> 00:11:49,290
Arkansas it going let's just too low

204
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:53,700
Clippers NPM note package manager helps

205
00:11:53,700 --> 00:12:05,740
you load packages npm install novela

206
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:08,660
when I run my hello world again that has

207
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:15,380
required this thing there it is I am now

208
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:17,660
logging instead of underscore i'm

209
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:20,000
logging the note baylor module this is

210
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,890
what the note mailer module made

211
00:12:21,890 --> 00:12:34,730
available to us ok one moment if we look

212
00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:39,050
in my current project folder will see in

213
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:42,440
this list of files the node modules

214
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:45,650
folder when I am being installed that's

215
00:12:45,650 --> 00:12:48,350
where I put it let's take a look inside

216
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:52,970
node modules there's no mail if I RM

217
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:57,920
node modules completely and I try to run

218
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:00,440
have a world again it's going to fail

219
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:04,730
again all i have to do is installed no

220
00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:07,370
nailer again and it's going to bring it

221
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:09,260
back and put it in that's going to

222
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:14,030
invent that folder remember noted

223
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:17,330
modules is gone but as soon as i install

224
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:18,920
the male organ is going to come back so

225
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:22,310
that was the local install you now have

226
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:24,770
the ability to define a dependency on a

227
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:31,760
file on a package to you didn't right if

228
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,860
I want this to be available globally on

229
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:35,420
my system so that I never have to

230
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:37,040
install it for a new project ever again

231
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:41,900
I would just say that's G this means

232
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:43,640
that my whole system will have access to

233
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:48,500
it and it's a little more riddle because

234
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,720
I might accidentally start reading

235
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,430
software that depends on node veiler

236
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:54,200
without realizing that it's not going to

237
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,360
work anywhere that doesn't have it as a

238
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:58,670
global dependency instead I should

239
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:01,670
probably just install it locally and do

240
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:04,310
some work to make sure that that project

241
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:18,580
pulls in is dependency

242
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:22,010
and that is about it about all you need

243
00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:26,060
to know the next thing I'd like to do is

244
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:28,520
turn it over to you guys to do the this

245
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:30,980
is a half hour session toxically happy

246
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:33,590
which is supposed to be hands-on you do

247
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:35,150
what you're working on and we can help

248
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:37,990
you solve whatever problem you have

249
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:40,760
we've got a couple of minutes over but I

250
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:42,650
think it's ok the next things I'd like

251
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:44,570
to do our answer questions you guys have

252
00:14:44,570 --> 00:14:47,390
about this this basic stuff and then get

253
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:50,900
to having you guys write some scripts

254
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:53,540
that depend on one another and load

255
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:55,730
scripts that are next to each other from

256
00:14:55,730 --> 00:14:57,620
files that are the same folder and then

257
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:59,990
maybe download and install some NPM

258
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:02,060
packages and fri playing with that once

259
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:04,130
you've done that you can write code that

260
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:07,160
interfaces with any of your hardware the

261
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,780
big punch line probably the main reason

262
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:11,360
to use node apart from the fact that the

263
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,030
browser is a bit complicated and not the

264
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:15,440
best target environment for all

265
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,320
applications is that no one has access

266
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:21,560
to hardware you can interface with

267
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:25,130
low-level libraries that talk to your

268
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:26,870
network card but don't need to go

269
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:28,490
through a dollar a jacket or something

270
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:30,350
like that they talk to your mouse

271
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:32,510
directly they talked to the primitives

272
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:34,820
of the system you can do file system

273
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:37,760
access info if you get done loading

274
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:40,340
scripts between between two different

275
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:42,980
files and you want to try to access a

276
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:45,260
file that seems like a good next step

277
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:47,240
extra credit there any questions before

278
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:51,910
we turn over to the independent exercise

279
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:54,590
yeah when you send that you have access

280
00:15:54,590 --> 00:15:58,910
to it our work is well the code is being

281
00:15:58,910 --> 00:16:02,750
compliant in the server right no one

282
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:05,980
actually is compiling

283
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:09,370
lying ah sorry you step the question was

284
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:15,970
you get access to the to the hardware

285
00:16:15,970 --> 00:16:19,450
when the code is on the server not when

286
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:21,400
it's on the time and this is actually a

287
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:23,860
distinction that this is a spurious

288
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:27,940
distinction known code fundamentally

289
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:30,160
does not run on the client it doesn't

290
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,200
run in a browser it will never it will

291
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:35,410
never be shipped down to any one node

292
00:16:35,410 --> 00:16:37,690
code is just JavaScript the interpreter

293
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:40,360
the environment being run without a

294
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:44,560
browser around so if the user if the

295
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,030
user has known on their computer and

296
00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:48,280
they type node and the thing they will

297
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:51,130
have access to their own heart if you on

298
00:16:51,130 --> 00:16:54,220
your server type node or whatever you'll

299
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:55,750
have your that process will have access

300
00:16:55,750 --> 00:17:00,040
to your heart it takes a lot of work to

301
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:02,650
get any code to be shipped down to the

302
00:17:02,650 --> 00:17:06,400
client even in know even in JavaScript

303
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,400
there are home old tutorials on how you

304
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,410
can use the node execution environment

305
00:17:11,410 --> 00:17:14,230
to serve web requests and in so doing

306
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:16,750
you are fundamentally homely capable of

307
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:18,760
sending down files and perhaps their

308
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:20,680
browser is going to be rendering and

309
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:23,440
then then your client on the other end

310
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,930
will be subject to whatever constraints

311
00:17:25,930 --> 00:17:28,570
that long time and fire attacks but on

312
00:17:28,570 --> 00:17:30,160
your server you're going to be running

313
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,410
no through the command block furthermore

314
00:17:32,410 --> 00:17:34,540
you can be running known from some

315
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:37,540
machine that is not its officer it's

316
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:41,650
just a machine into a search engine any

317
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:46,960
other questions okay sweet if you have

318
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:54,070
not already dabbled with it I encourage

319
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:58,980
you to find the documentation or node

320
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:03,580
these are all of the these are all the

321
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:16,240
packages available in tone

322
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:19,400
these are available that by default some

323
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:24,050
of them you might have to require they

324
00:18:24,050 --> 00:18:27,490
all come as part of the note environment

325
00:18:27,490 --> 00:18:29,540
when you need access to the

326
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:30,980
functionality that one of them offers

327
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:35,240
like for example console if you want a

328
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:37,130
lot of things out you might need to

329
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:38,660
include the console obviously we didn't

330
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:41,440
have to do that in my environment but

331
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:46,370
HTTP will probably have to bring it

332
00:18:46,370 --> 00:18:48,200
yourself you need to make network calls

333
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:51,400
you don't have dollar Ajax anymore

334
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:55,460
you're going to have to require HTTP so

335
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:57,860
just remind you how you do that in here

336
00:18:57,860 --> 00:19:10,460
is if our HTTP equals require

337
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:16,520
all that you've got

338
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:21,660
alright so please start a file using

339
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:26,760
terminal or your Windows user using uh

340
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:32,250
whatever they have and if you can get

341
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:35,430
two files one file to make an export and

342
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:36,690
the other files are loaded you're doing

343
00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:38,550
good if you want to take further than

344
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:40,140
that RT is should be able to help you

345
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:42,630
with whatever puzzles your basic you got

346
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:44,550
about seven minutes before we start the

347
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:55,290
next session which is keyword this will

348
00:19:55,290 --> 00:19:56,490
probably keep hanging out through the

349
00:19:56,490 --> 00:19:58,050
break though it's a half-hour break in
