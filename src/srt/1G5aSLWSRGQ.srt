Empathy is not enough\h the power of engaging
hard to reach users

00:00:06,999 --> 00:00:09,860
Ariba Jahan
PARISS: Hey, everyone.

3
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:10,860
Again.

4
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:11,961
This is our final talk of the evening.

5
00:00:11,961 --> 00:00:12,961
So, this next speaker coming up, she climbed
mountain Kilimanjaro, isn't that crazy, okay.

6
00:00:12,961 --> 00:00:13,961
So, this is who is not in the room: Building
better products by engaging hard to reach

7
00:00:13,961 --> 00:00:14,961
users.

8
00:00:14,961 --> 00:00:15,961
Let's give a warm welcome to Ariba Jahan.

9
00:00:15,961 --> 00:00:16,961
[ Applause ]
ARIBA: Hi.

10
00:00:16,961 --> 00:00:17,961
Just so you know, you'll see me stepping on
and stepping off a stool here.

11
00:00:17,961 --> 00:00:18,961
I'm 4 foot 11 inches so some adjustments needed
to be made.

12
00:00:18,961 --> 00:00:21,920
So, I'm gonna give you a second to kind of
read some of these headlines that showcase

13
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:25,050
what's been happening in our industry.

14
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:31,450
So, this\h this is what we get when we don't
challenge our assumptions.

15
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:34,629
Hi, I'm Ariba Jahan.

16
00:00:34,629 --> 00:00:39,460
And today I'm here to share with you four
ways you can challenge your assumptions to

17
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:41,930
avoid headlines like those.

18
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:47,730
And instead build better and more impactful
products for your audience.

19
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:50,480
And the four methods\h oh, okay.

20
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:58,370
And the four methods I'll share with you are
helping us think through product development

21
00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:00,670
in a new way at the ad council.

22
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:05,080
And I'm hoping they'll be helpful for you
as you bring these back to your work.

23
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:13,320
So, for context, the Ad Council, we're a nonprofit
organization that leverages the power of communication

24
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:18,990
to tackle the nation's biggest challenges
like preventing wildfires and LGBTQ rights

25
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:24,750
awareness and diversity and inclusion and
promoting girls in STEM.

26
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:30,890
We bring together industry leaders to develop
campaigns to create social impact and create

27
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:33,550
action.

28
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:38,890
And as the director of innovation at the Ad
Council, my responsibility is to facilitate

29
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:45,970
innovative thinking and work in our teams
as well as cultivate a culture where experimentation

30
00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:49,080
and curiosity can thrive.

31
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:55,591
And I get to do that in many ways including
training our whole staff on Splash Box, which

32
00:01:55,591 --> 00:01:58,470
is our approach to innovation.

33
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:05,560
And it incorporates methodologies from LEAN
as well as human centered design with mindsets

34
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:08,860
to cultivate in our teams.

35
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:15,209
And to date we've trained 80% of the organization,
giving us a shared proposal and toolset to

36
00:02:15,209 --> 00:02:16,209
innovate.

37
00:02:16,209 --> 00:02:25,510
And as a way to bring the training\h the skills
people learn at the training to life and make

38
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:31,840
them more tangible, we created a project where
our new innovators can apply their skills

39
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:35,420
to create a digital prototype for one of our
campaign issues.

40
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:41,209
So, today I'm really excited to share with
you one of these digital prototype projects

41
00:02:41,209 --> 00:02:47,700
where our assumptions got in the way and we
had to use these\h the four methods I mentioned

42
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:52,230
to uncover our assumptions and to really challenge
them.

43
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:57,879
So, the campaign issue we chose was teen bullying
prevention.

44
00:02:57,879 --> 00:03:02,250
And the task at hand was, well, how do we
leverage the power of technology, what it

45
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:05,879
is today, to answer this big question?

46
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:12,280
How might we influence teens to reduce peer
mistreatment and empower one another by building

47
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:17,870
and perpetuating a more empathetic, supportive
and inclusive culture?

48
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:23,430
Our target audience for this project were
teens ranging from the ages 13 to 17 years

49
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:28,249
old who fell into the category of "Good eggs."

50
00:03:28,249 --> 00:03:35,329
We defined" Good eggs 'as teens who believe
they're good people and value kindness and

51
00:03:35,329 --> 00:03:40,599
respect of one another and they want to be
the best version of themselves.

52
00:03:40,599 --> 00:03:48,620
So, as you can imagine, we were really excited
to contribute towards creating a more inclusive

53
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:50,299
world for our next generations.

54
00:03:50,299 --> 00:03:55,680
So, as any good team, we dug in n and did
a tremendous amount of research.

55
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:01,379
From reading every single research report
we could get our hands on about Gen Z, and

56
00:04:01,379 --> 00:04:05,879
interviewing teens, teachers, as well as issue
experts.

57
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:11,590
And our research gave us so many insightful
findings, that we were able to come up with

58
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:16,949
over a hundred ideas and 20 concepts.

59
00:04:16,949 --> 00:04:24,050
And we then showed our strongest ideas to
team to get some early feedback on which ideas

60
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:26,170
do we refine, how do we refine them?

61
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:30,639
And which ideas should we be leaving behind?

62
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:36,220
After this many rounds of research and getting
early user feedback directly from teens, we

63
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:38,759
felt pretty confident in our direction.

64
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:44,330
And we knew that whatever solution we create
in order to solve for bullying has to solve

65
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:48,000
the three goals.

66
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:54,280
Our research told us that good eggs have an
innate desire to create the change they wanted

67
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,860
to see in the world.

68
00:04:55,860 --> 00:05:07,180
We wanted to show them that and their actions,
hoping they will adopt the kinder behaviors.

69
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:10,900
And two, we should double down on social media.

70
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:15,770
We found out that 91% of Gen Z are on social
media.

71
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:21,180
So, we knew immediately that we needed to
prioritize and emphasize the role of social

72
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:25,110
media in our digital solution.

73
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:28,259
And three, leverage the rise of CGI influencers.

74
00:05:28,259 --> 00:05:36,680
See, at the time, four computer generated
based influencers are garnered over 1 million

75
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,830
followers on Instagram.

76
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:42,780
And we were kind of blown away by those and
we need to do something with this.

77
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:49,990
Whether it's to do storytelling or to model
good behaviors to teens in hopes that it works

78
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:51,699
for them.

79
00:05:51,699 --> 00:06:01,080
So, keeping these three goals in mind, we
refined our 20 concepts into five promising

80
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,349
ideas.

81
00:06:02,349 --> 00:06:07,470
And then we took these ideas to teams to get
some more validation and then start building

82
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:09,230
them.

83
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:16,639
And the main thing we learned at this round
with teens is that we were wrong on all fronts.

84
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:20,710
What we focused on as goals were actually
just assumptions.

85
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:23,900
Starting with the word bullying.

86
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:27,810
It turns out that the only people that use
the word bullying is a bunch of adults who

87
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:29,469
want to end bullying.

88
00:06:29,469 --> 00:06:32,849
[ Laughter ]
And, you know, we learned that because we

89
00:06:32,849 --> 00:06:39,229
talked to teens and when we asked them, hey,
can you share your experience with bullying?

90
00:06:39,229 --> 00:06:41,370
They didn't have much to share.

91
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:48,020
But when we changed our wording and asked,
can you share the last time someone hurt you?

92
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:50,219
Or maybe when you've hurt someone else?

93
00:06:50,219 --> 00:06:56,030
They shared stories about being excluded,
shaming, blaming.

94
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:59,270
And there was just so much more vulnerability
involved.

95
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:05,490
So, it turned out that their language around
mistreatment looked very different than ours.

96
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:10,169
And they're actually way more self aware than
we give them credit for.

97
00:07:10,169 --> 00:07:16,040
We asked them, can you think about a moment
where you mistreated someone or you hurt someone.

98
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:23,270
And when they did that, they used words like
regret, guilt, is upset as how they felt afterwards.

99
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:29,400
So, they're clearly fully aware of the implications
of their actions.

100
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:35,419
And it turned out that even though 91% of
Gen Z are on social, they value privacy and

101
00:07:35,419 --> 00:07:38,669
authenticity way more than what we knew.

102
00:07:38,669 --> 00:07:43,860
To the point where they have two types of
Instagram accounts.

103
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:48,349
One is called Finsta which is fake Instagram
account.

104
00:07:48,349 --> 00:07:51,659
And that is where they are their most authentic
self.

105
00:07:51,659 --> 00:07:55,490
Photos are unfiltered, they keep it private.

106
00:07:55,490 --> 00:08:01,050
No crafted captions and they keep the number
of people who can follow that account very

107
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:02,050
small.

108
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:08,360
And then they have the Rinsta, the real Instagram
account where it's hyper curated, well crafted

109
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,479
captions.

110
00:08:09,479 --> 00:08:17,659
Perhaps even song lyrics and that's where
they want to have a lot of followers.

111
00:08:17,659 --> 00:08:23,240
And when it came down to CGI influencers,
only like a few teens knew what a CGI influencer

112
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,240
was.

113
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:28,379
And even the ones that followed them only
did it out of curiosity for the character's

114
00:08:28,379 --> 00:08:30,439
fashion.

115
00:08:30,439 --> 00:08:35,159
And if you\h I'm not so sure if you can read
it, but if you can look at their handwritten

116
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:41,409
feedback on the screen, you'll notice what
they wanted instead was someone relatable.

117
00:08:41,409 --> 00:08:43,899
Someone who might have had a tough childhood.

118
00:08:43,899 --> 00:08:47,050
Someone who has gone through issues.

119
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:48,770
And they also wanted someone funny.

120
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:52,769
I really think just wanted Kevin Hart.

121
00:08:52,769 --> 00:08:58,480
[ Laughter ]
So, our assumptions were checked.

122
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,120
You know?

123
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:05,300
And before I dive into the four tactics that
allowed us to uncover these assumptions, I

124
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:07,430
want to talk about assumptions for a second.

125
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:17,650
You know, assumptions\h assumption is something
we believe to be true without any evidence.

126
00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:26,160
And the reason it's so easy for our assumptions
and biases to come into our work or to creep

127
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:32,060
up even after tremendous amount of research,
is because our brain is constantly making

128
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:35,560
assumptions just in the interest of efficiency.

129
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:43,260
See, the thing is, over the course of 200,000
years, our brain has created several mental

130
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:48,889
shortcuts to help us cope and survive and
deal with the tremendous amounts of innovation

131
00:09:48,889 --> 00:09:50,589
in our world.

132
00:09:50,589 --> 00:09:58,230
So, we end up having shortcuts that help us
make sense of large amounts of information.

133
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:03,260
Shortcuts that help us determine what's important
to remember and what to recall.

134
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:06,589
Shortcuts that create explanations for us
when we don't have enough meaning or when

135
00:10:06,589 --> 00:10:08,790
there is not enough context.

136
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:10,660
And shortcuts that help us act quickly.

137
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:17,050
These ready shorts that help us remember how
to ride a bike, know 2 plus 2, help us detect

138
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:25,660
joy or frustration in someone's voice and
to run from perceived danger.

139
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:31,930
While all of those sound necessary, these
are the same shortcuts that cause us to make

140
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:38,000
assumptions, make snap judgments, jump to
conclusions and make decisions based on our

141
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,300
biases.

142
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:45,589
And these mental shortcuts are more commonly
known as cognitive biases.

143
00:10:45,589 --> 00:10:52,410
And the thing is, with 180 of these mental
shortcuts active in our brain all the time,

144
00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:58,090
it's kind of hard to spot when they're getting
in the way or when they're active.

145
00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:03,660
So, I'll call out three that got in our way
and we didn't even notice it.

146
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:10,019
See, we have a mental shortcut that causes
us to be easily influenced by what is stored

147
00:11:10,019 --> 00:11:12,330
in our memory or what's familiar.

148
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:17,829
And that's the way\h that's the reason why
all of us use the word bullying to describe

149
00:11:17,829 --> 00:11:19,840
that interaction.

150
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:23,350
Even without even questioning does that language
even resonate?

151
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:26,209
Does it even work?

152
00:11:26,209 --> 00:11:32,170
We have another mental shortcut that causes
us to make judgments and impressions by relying

153
00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:35,690
only on the information made available to
us.

154
00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:42,380
And that's why when we see data like 91% of
teens are on social media and they spend 9

155
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:44,940
hours consuming media, we're just like, oh
my god.

156
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:48,660
They must be sharing everything and they're
on it all the time.

157
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:51,690
Let's just like do everything social media
related.

158
00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:57,199
What we don't do is actively question, well,
does this 91% do the same exact thing?

159
00:11:57,199 --> 00:12:00,130
Did they all use the same features in the
same exact way?

160
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:02,139
Do they all feel the same way?

161
00:12:02,139 --> 00:12:05,410
We don't do that.

162
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:11,630
And the last mental shortcut I'll call out
is that we're just naturally drawn to details

163
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:13,670
that confirm our own existing beliefs.

164
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:14,990
It's just what we do.

165
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:15,990
This is why we have friends.

166
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:17,509
This is how we make friends.

167
00:12:17,509 --> 00:12:20,720
I'll look for someone who likes the same thing
as I do.

168
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,420
Now we're friends.

169
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:27,940
And the thing is, that same bias is what causes
us to find things that validate us.

170
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:32,750
So, when we were super hyped up about CGI
influencers, we ended up paying a lot more

171
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:37,910
closer attention to headlines like these that
said, oh, my god, CGI influencers are the

172
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:40,670
future of the influencer marketing.

173
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:42,459
And that's what happens.

174
00:12:42,459 --> 00:12:49,199
So, while great for survival, mental shortcuts
are not great for innovation.

175
00:12:49,199 --> 00:12:54,019
And that's how easy it is for mental shortcuts
that are designed to help us cope to get in

176
00:12:54,019 --> 00:12:57,210
the way of us making products that are right
for our audience.

177
00:12:57,210 --> 00:13:00,779
So, for the rest of my talk, I will focus
on how we used\h is it jumping on the screen?

178
00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:01,779
Because it's jumping here.

179
00:13:01,779 --> 00:13:02,779
So, I just wanted to double check.

180
00:13:02,779 --> 00:13:03,779
It's jumping?

181
00:13:03,779 --> 00:13:04,779
Okay.

182
00:13:04,779 --> 00:13:05,779
I'm gonna assume someone's gonna take care
of that.

183
00:13:05,779 --> 00:13:06,779
[ Laughter ]
But I'll keep going.

184
00:13:06,779 --> 00:13:07,779
So, yes.

185
00:13:07,779 --> 00:13:08,779
I'll focus on how we used these four methods
in the teen bullying prevention prototype

186
00:13:08,779 --> 00:13:09,779
projects.

187
00:13:09,779 --> 00:13:12,449
And I hope it gives you inspiration on how
you can take some of these methods back into

188
00:13:12,449 --> 00:13:17,110
your projects so you can challenge your assumption.

189
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:18,519
Okay.

190
00:13:18,519 --> 00:13:21,240
So, the first one being mapping\h oh!

191
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,240
Mapping assumptions.

192
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:25,713
I'll just read for a second so you can have
the slides while I talk.

193
00:13:25,713 --> 00:13:26,713
All right.

194
00:13:26,713 --> 00:13:27,713
We're up.

195
00:13:27,713 --> 00:13:28,713
So, the first one I'll talk about is mapping
assumptions.

196
00:13:28,713 --> 00:13:29,713
It's an activity where we actively\h what
slide is that?

197
00:13:29,713 --> 00:13:30,713
Oh, that's not moving.

198
00:13:30,713 --> 00:13:31,713
All right.

199
00:13:31,713 --> 00:13:32,713
Now we're there.

200
00:13:32,713 --> 00:13:33,713
So, it's an activity where we actively uncover
critical uncertainties, unknowns and blind

201
00:13:33,713 --> 00:13:36,959
spots about our audience, challenge and solutions
we're thinking about exploring.

202
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:41,709
And the thing about assumptions, as we saw,
is that they don't always look and feel like

203
00:13:41,709 --> 00:13:42,709
assumptions.

204
00:13:42,709 --> 00:13:43,709
They feel like facts.

205
00:13:43,709 --> 00:13:49,800
So, it's really good to have a diverse team
in the room so that we can all help each other

206
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:53,649
spot each other's blind spots and challenge
each other's assumptions.

207
00:13:53,649 --> 00:14:00,649
So, for our project, in order to map assumptions,
we started by asking ourselves questions around

208
00:14:00,649 --> 00:14:03,000
teens' experiences with mistreatment.

209
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,690
So, we tried to figure out like how much do
we know the audience?

210
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:09,399
What type of language do they use?

211
00:14:09,399 --> 00:14:10,750
What's their lifestyle?

212
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:11,750
What brings them joy?

213
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:13,710
What are their priority, pain points?

214
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:16,790
And how do they use technology?

215
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:22,769
And then we asked ourselves, well, what do
we believe to be true about teen mistreatment?

216
00:14:22,769 --> 00:14:27,269
How does mistreatment show up in their lives
and how do they solve it?

217
00:14:27,269 --> 00:14:31,580
And is this a challenge they need solved by
us?

218
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:35,220
And just in general, what else do they know
that we should know about and whose voices

219
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:37,660
have been heard?

220
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:42,459
When we did this, we had more questions than
answers.

221
00:14:42,459 --> 00:14:46,790
And despite all the research we did, we didn't
know much about teens.

222
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:52,000
So, we took all of our assumptions and needed
to figure out, where do we go from here?

223
00:14:52,000 --> 00:15:00,779
So, to prioritize what we needed to dig into,
we mapped on a 2x2 grid.

224
00:15:00,779 --> 00:15:06,240
From known to unknown, and the Y axis was
very important to not very important.

225
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:11,420
It and helped us tease out the critical uncertainties
that we needed to figure out before going

226
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:14,860
any further.

227
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:21,450
To recap, mapping assumptions can really help
us uncover our blind spots, what we believe

228
00:15:21,450 --> 00:15:24,300
to be true versus what is actually true.

229
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:27,769
And critical gaps in the team's overall knowledge.

230
00:15:27,769 --> 00:15:32,339
And answering these questions about the audience
and the challenge we're solving for is a great

231
00:15:32,339 --> 00:15:36,959
way to know where to go next, what to explore
before going any further or investing any

232
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:39,750
further in the project.

233
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:47,139
So, after rounds of interviewing with teens
and doing brainstorms within our teams, we

234
00:15:47,139 --> 00:15:50,940
had about 20 fleshed out concepts and we loved
them all.

235
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:54,069
But we had no clue which idea would work.

236
00:15:54,069 --> 00:16:00,259
And instead of just choosing an idea, just
praying something works, we decided to test

237
00:16:00,259 --> 00:16:02,920
five of our strongest concepts.

238
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:09,241
So, we ran several experiments to explore
Whether or not our ideas could create the

239
00:16:09,241 --> 00:16:15,410
desired outcome we were hoping for and to
garner any new knowledge.

240
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:22,029
And while mapping assumptions is a great place
to start, testing hypothesis kind of allows

241
00:16:22,029 --> 00:16:26,630
you to uncover all the invisible assumptions
that we didn't even notice yet.

242
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:31,440
So, to test multiple hypothesis, we do two
things.

243
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:38,370
We created hypothesis statements to get really
specific on what we were hope our ideas can

244
00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:39,370
do.

245
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:44,130
And then that helped us hone in on what are
we hoping to uncover through test something

246
00:16:44,130 --> 00:16:49,660
and then we identified our riskiest assumptions
which were, what are the beliefs we're holding

247
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:55,870
about our ideas that if disproven completely
break ours idea altogether?

248
00:16:55,870 --> 00:17:04,410
So, in order to create these hypothesis statements,
we reframed each of our ideas into a hypothesis

249
00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:07,620
by using a Madeline framework like this.

250
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:12,110
You fill in the parentheses with the relevant
information in your project.

251
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:19,209
So, we believe this audience has a problem
doing this.

252
00:17:19,209 --> 00:17:23,039
We believe this solution can help.

253
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:27,180
They will do this engagement resulting in
the desired outcome.

254
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:35,120
So, going back to our CGI project, this is
an example, our assumptions and our hypothesis

255
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:41,450
is, we believe that teens have a problem noticing
the impact of their actions which leads them

256
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:43,880
to mistreat each other.

257
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:50,809
We believe that a fictional CGI character
whose life captures the dramatic realities

258
00:17:50,809 --> 00:17:56,289
of the teen experience, including teachable
moments where the character models kindness,

259
00:17:56,289 --> 00:17:57,950
can help.

260
00:17:57,950 --> 00:18:04,010
And we believe that teens will follow and
relate to the character causing them to reflect

261
00:18:04,010 --> 00:18:07,780
and adopt the modeled positive behaviors in
real life.

262
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:11,820
So, it really gets the team to focus on, what
are we doing here?

263
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:12,909
What are we hoping to do?

264
00:18:12,909 --> 00:18:18,200
Versus getting tied up in the features and
the color and the UI of the product.

265
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:23,110
So, we did that for all five ideas.

266
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:26,870
And then we needed to identify our riskiest
assumption.

267
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:33,929
We did that by first asking, well, what must
be true in order for this idea to work?

268
00:18:33,929 --> 00:18:35,600
Like at all?

269
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:41,770
And what must be true in order for this idea
to add value to the teens' lives?

270
00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:46,400
And then when we answered these questions,
we looked through them and tried to identify

271
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:52,210
the ones that, if disproven, completely breaks
our idea.

272
00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:57,970
So, going back to our CGI project, we came
up with a lot of things that we're assuming

273
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:01,520
and hoping to be true in order for this idea
to work.

274
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:07,570
And what really stood out to us as our riskiest
assumption was our belief that teens will

275
00:19:07,570 --> 00:19:09,640
resonate with the CGI character.

276
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:16,750
See, if teens don't relate or follow the CGI
person, like this whole idea is irrelevant

277
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:19,700
and we're not going to do anything.

278
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:25,010
But what's great about testing is that we
can know that without ever spending any time

279
00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:30,840
investing in, developing and putting the CGI
character together.

280
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:37,510
So, by the time we did this for each one of
our ideas, we ended up with like a list of

281
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:42,830
elements and interactions that we were assuming
teens would love and engage with.

282
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:44,270
But had no proof.

283
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:48,000
So, all of the\h all of them needed to be
tested.

284
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,900
Like does anonymity really matter?

285
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:58,690
Do teens care about interacting with things
in real time and user generated content?

286
00:19:58,690 --> 00:20:05,320
And do they really value influencer oriented
things?

287
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:10,210
And then we took those and we wanted to test
them without having to build anything.

288
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:16,120
So, we used simple things like surveys and
design prototypes to test all of those features

289
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:19,240
to figure out, like, where are we going?

290
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:27,159
So, to recap, the simple act of reframing
an idea into a hypothesis is such a great

291
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:32,710
reminder that regardless of how exciting our
ideas may sound, we don't really know yet

292
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:35,179
if any of them will work.

293
00:20:35,179 --> 00:20:40,559
So, they need to be tested in order for us
to move forward.

294
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:48,090
And to help prioritize what to even test first,
we really hone in on the beliefs we're holding

295
00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:55,020
on to about our ideas that if invalidated
our idea needs to be scrapped.

296
00:20:55,020 --> 00:21:00,890
And the thing is, being able to test our ideas
before building anything is actually gave

297
00:21:00,890 --> 00:21:04,390
us a lot of freedom from creativity.

298
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:09,671
It gave us the liberty to dream just a little
bigger knowing that our audience would let

299
00:21:09,671 --> 00:21:12,270
us know what to refine and what to leave behind.

300
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:14,419
So, let's go big.

301
00:21:14,419 --> 00:21:21,470
So, testing multiple ideas with our users
was super insightful.

302
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:25,210
But there's a limitation to how much we could
learn through testing.

303
00:21:25,210 --> 00:21:30,820
Because the thing is, when we have prototypes
that we're showing and asking questions to

304
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:35,809
teens, they're only reacting to whatever we're
giving them.

305
00:21:35,809 --> 00:21:41,340
And that's why engaging and working with and
empowering our users to create their own solutions

306
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:45,460
was so critical to see.

307
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:52,780
We coordinated with a high school in New York
City and we\h we hosted three co creation

308
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:54,299
sessions.

309
00:21:54,299 --> 00:21:59,770
And we really wanted to understand how do
teens perceive bullying today?

310
00:21:59,770 --> 00:22:03,740
What types of digital interactions do they
even enjoy?

311
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:10,190
And that list of riskiest elements that we
were so excited about?

312
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:13,150
We wanted to invalidate or validate some of
them.

313
00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:18,470
And lastly, we wanted to see how would teens
solve this?

314
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:25,049
So, what you see up here is a snapshot of
the solutions students came up with when we

315
00:22:25,049 --> 00:22:30,309
asked them to design a digital tool that could
help people be more mind and inclusive of

316
00:22:30,309 --> 00:22:31,490
others.

317
00:22:31,490 --> 00:22:36,330
And/or to help people avoid hurting someone's
feelings.

318
00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:40,990
We purposely didn't use words like teen or
bullying because we didn't to want mislead

319
00:22:40,990 --> 00:22:45,799
them or drive them in a direction that's not
natural for them.

320
00:22:45,799 --> 00:22:49,490
We then got our user feedback on these new
ideas as well.

321
00:22:49,490 --> 00:22:57,400
So, the co creation sessions validated some
hypotheses while invalidating others.

322
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:05,170
And what we learned from teens directly helped
us design three new cocreated prototypes.

323
00:23:05,170 --> 00:23:09,970
And the thing about co creations is, you saw
how insightful they were.

324
00:23:09,970 --> 00:23:15,340
But they also uncovered ideas that we couldn't
have come up with on our own.

325
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:21,419
For example, our students came up with this
brilliant idea which they called In My Bag.

326
00:23:21,419 --> 00:23:27,870
In my bag is a phrase teens use to indicate
when they are feeling emotionally unavailable

327
00:23:27,870 --> 00:23:29,150
or sad.

328
00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:35,450
So, this is an app that would allow users
to air drop or somehow alert their friends

329
00:23:35,450 --> 00:23:42,200
when they are not feeling emotionally available
and they want to be left alone.

330
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:47,140
And you can see the handwritten feedback from
other students on this idea.

331
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:53,100
And their feedback on this idea was super
enthusiastic and very validating.

332
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:55,680
They said thing like, it's fire.

333
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:59,590
And you can tell people around you how you're
actually feeling.

334
00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:00,590
See?

335
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:04,429
Their comments showed us that they wanted
to be vulnerable.

336
00:24:04,429 --> 00:24:07,260
And they wanted to share how they were feeling.

337
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:13,020
Which is contrary to the social pressure they
have to be tough.

338
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:21,120
So, the ability to uncover new learnings about
our audience and hear ideas that we couldn't

339
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:26,860
have ever come up with on our own, is what
makes co creation so powerful.

340
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:33,340
And by creating space for our users to join
us in the process, we get out of our own way.

341
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:38,350
So, it's been quite a journey.

342
00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:43,020
From identifying opportunities and researching
for insights to coming up with over a hundred

343
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:49,960
ideas to then testing those hypothesis with
teens and then co designing some with them,

344
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:54,850
there were moments when our ideas were invalidated
and our assumptions were checked.

345
00:24:54,850 --> 00:24:58,770
and the thing is, that's what learning looks
like.

346
00:24:58,770 --> 00:25:04,010
And also we made progress, it didn't come
easily.

347
00:25:04,010 --> 00:25:09,399
We went out of our way to find a diverse mix
of teens to interview and worked with our

348
00:25:09,399 --> 00:25:13,940
local high school to organize these co creations.

349
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:19,029
And we needed parents to sign permission slips,
we had to work around exam schedules, homework

350
00:25:19,029 --> 00:25:25,779
schedules, and we had to be totally okay if
a teen suddenly flaked on a phone interview.

351
00:25:25,779 --> 00:25:26,779
But you know what?

352
00:25:26,779 --> 00:25:31,059
All of that\h all of that relentless effort
was worth it.

353
00:25:31,059 --> 00:25:35,409
Because the audience we were looking to serve
was not in the room and their perspective

354
00:25:35,409 --> 00:25:38,990
was crucial.

355
00:25:38,990 --> 00:25:45,049
And to empower teams to be this relentless,
to chase after these unknowns, we must create

356
00:25:45,049 --> 00:25:49,740
a culture where curiosity and innovation can
thrive.

357
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:53,090
And what does that look like?

358
00:25:53,090 --> 00:26:00,169
It's a team where there's less of a monoculture
of thoughts and ideas but has people who seek

359
00:26:00,169 --> 00:26:04,010
perspectives unlike their own.

360
00:26:04,010 --> 00:26:09,230
Where we spend less time defending ideas and
spend more time testing our hypothesis with

361
00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:11,590
a diverse representation of our audience.

362
00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:17,950
We spent less time looking for that one right
answer.

363
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:22,720
And realized that we must create space for
everyone to embrace the unknown and ambiguity

364
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:26,230
and just stay curious.

365
00:26:26,230 --> 00:26:31,630
And instead of using language and reward systems
in our workplace to heighten our sense of

366
00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:37,190
fear or failure, let's just create a culture
that's open to being wrong.

367
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:46,399
So, rounding off, I want you to remember that
our brain has many mental shortcuts that are

368
00:26:46,399 --> 00:26:50,610
really just constantly on and just trying
to help us survive and hope and process the

369
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:52,270
world around us.

370
00:26:52,270 --> 00:27:00,750
But those same shortcuts also make us do\h
make decisions based on our biases, make snap

371
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:09,419
judgments, and make assumptions and miss critical
information that others wouldn't miss.

372
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:16,179
So, while we'd all like to believe that we're
not that biased or maybe we're not as biased

373
00:27:16,179 --> 00:27:22,140
as the other people, that thought in itself
is a bias.

374
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:24,570
It's called bias blind spot.

375
00:27:24,570 --> 00:27:31,789
So, this bias blind spot can cause us to let
our assumptions go unchecked and affecting

376
00:27:31,789 --> 00:27:35,050
our ability to make the right product for
our audience.

377
00:27:35,050 --> 00:27:39,940
So, I want you to remember to do these four
things.

378
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:44,309
Let's try to map our assumptions and unknowns
about the challenge we're trying to tackle

379
00:27:44,309 --> 00:27:47,450
and the people that we're trying to solve
for, and the solutions that we think that

380
00:27:47,450 --> 00:27:52,669
would help them so we can uncover the gaps
of knowledge in our teams and figure out,

381
00:27:52,669 --> 00:27:57,010
what do we have to really explore to move
any forward?

382
00:27:57,010 --> 00:28:02,510
Let's test multiple ideas to see if they really
create the outcome we were hoping for?

383
00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:06,460
And a great place to start with that is really
going after the beliefs that we're holding

384
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:12,710
on to that if proven wrong can completely
invalidate our idea.

385
00:28:12,710 --> 00:28:17,830
And let's bring our audience more into our
process by cocreating with them so that they

386
00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:24,320
can solve the things themselves and show us
ideas that we can't come up with on our own.

387
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:29,330
And let's be relentless in making sure that
the people that we're trying to serve, that

388
00:28:29,330 --> 00:28:35,290
their voices are heard and that we have a
diverse team in place to hear them and that

389
00:28:35,290 --> 00:28:39,690
we are making sure that we're aligned with
our product, goals and ethics.

390
00:28:39,690 --> 00:28:49,330
And lastly, nurture a team that seeks perspectives
unlike their own, values testing and can stay

391
00:28:49,330 --> 00:28:51,269
curious.

392
00:28:51,269 --> 00:29:00,149
So, instead of fighting the 180 mental shortcuts,
evolution has ingrained in us, Let's use these

393
00:29:00,149 --> 00:29:05,850
four methods to uncover and challenge our
assumptions so that we can make better and

394
00:29:05,850 --> 00:29:07,120
more impactful products for our audience.

395
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,120
Thank you.

396
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:09,120
[ Applause ]
>> Thank you.

397
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,120
PARISS: How are you feel something
KATIE: I'm pretty tired.

398
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:11,120
I'm pretty tired.

399
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,120
I just did some yoga on stage in the other
room.

400
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:13,120
That took a lot out of me.

401
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,120
But I'm feeling good.

402
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:15,120
I had a good day can you have a good day?

403
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,120
PARISS: I had a really good day.

404
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:17,120
KATIE: Did y'all have a good day?

405
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,120
PATRICIA: Again, I want to thank the speakers.

406
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:19,120
You did amazing.

407
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,120
I know you were all nervous.

408
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:21,120
You killed it.

409
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,120
Great job.

410
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:23,120
