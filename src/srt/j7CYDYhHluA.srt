1
00:00:04,009 --> 00:00:10,019

hey everyone how's the sound okay good

2
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:12,780
so I'm Wendy in case any of you weren't

3
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:14,130
sure I'm going to be talking about being

4
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:15,660
the first person that your startup to

5
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:18,150
have a baby so that's not the talk that

6
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:19,770
you were expecting feel free to escape

7
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:22,289
now you won't hurt my feelings

8
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:23,820
but assuming that this is the talk that

9
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:26,160
you are here to listen to let me

10
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,199
introduce myself first I'm Wendy I'm a

11
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:30,990
senior software engineer at aspiration

12
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:33,540
which is a fin tech startup in Los

13
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:36,210
Angeles and so I wanted to start this

14
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:37,950
talk by giving a disclaimer that this

15
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:40,079
talk is based on my experience as

16
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:41,790
someone who lives in the u.s. in

17
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:44,160
California with all the cultural

18
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,500
attitudes towards parents and policies

19
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,600
that go along with that so I realized

20
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:49,820
there are really big differences

21
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:52,590
potentially and cultures as well as

22
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:54,000
differences in maternity and paternity

23
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,449
leaves so if there's anything a part of

24
00:00:57,449 --> 00:00:58,859
my experience that doesn't ring true for

25
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:00,570
you I would love to hear about your

26
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:03,030
experiences after my talk and I'll be

27
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:05,220
around so just grab me so with that

28
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:07,350
caveat out of the way let's get to why I

29
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:09,570
decided to give this talk about parental

30
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:12,360
leave so a little over three years ago

31
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:14,189
while I was working at a start-up I

32
00:01:14,189 --> 00:01:17,009
found out it was pregnant and at first I

33
00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:19,950
was like this super excited but then

34
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:23,280
that quickly turned to anxiety so you

35
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,320
might be wondering why isn't having a

36
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,170
baby a happy experience

37
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:29,820
well the start up like a lot of startups

38
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:32,939
had no formal family leave policy so

39
00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:34,229
that's not to say that there weren't any

40
00:01:34,229 --> 00:01:36,780
parents at the startup there were but as

41
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:39,119
you all probably know tech especially

42
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:42,090
startups tends to skew young and male so

43
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:44,549
a lot of the parents that were working

44
00:01:44,549 --> 00:01:46,799
at my startup left for two weeks for a

45
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:48,750
vacation time and then went right back

46
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:50,399
to work and obviously that wasn't going

47
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:52,500
to work for me and in the u.s. there's

48
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,450
no law at the federal level that

49
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:56,850
requires any paid family leave so it's

50
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:59,189
up to individual states or companies to

51
00:01:59,189 --> 00:02:00,450
make it more generous leaves if they

52
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:04,110
want to do so for us we had an HR person

53
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:06,659
which also not a lot of startups have

54
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:09,030
but from everything that I heard even

55
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:12,030
people with HR representatives didn't

56
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:12,250
really

57
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:14,320
know what the correct maternity or

58
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:16,450
paternity leave should be and so I knew

59
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:17,320
I was gonna have to figure it out for

60
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,430
myself

61
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:20,290
little did I know that was the first the

62
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:22,600
many things I'd have to figure out and

63
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,550
so it took a lot of work from being

64
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:26,950
completely lost to feeling like I could

65
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:29,230
have a degree in family leave policy so

66
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:31,150
this is the talk that I wish someone had

67
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:33,280
given me when I was newly pregnant and

68
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,690
hopefully I'll be able to share some

69
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:37,420
tips that will help you figure out what

70
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:38,740
your leave is and what you can expect

71
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:41,140
and what steps you can take to make your

72
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:43,030
life easier if you're the first person

73
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:47,350
to have a baby at your startup so before

74
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:49,630
I jump into things I made a legend just

75
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:53,530
to show what I'm a bit about what I

76
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:55,900
wanted to do differently what I would do

77
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:59,709
again tips and hints and observations as

78
00:02:59,709 --> 00:03:01,270
well as things that I just found to be

79
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:05,860
important so first up is spewing out

80
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:07,620
your leave

81
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:09,450
before you talk to anybody at your

82
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:12,090
company I'd highly suggest that you do

83
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:13,410
your homework to figure out what leave

84
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:15,420
you're entitled to no one cares about

85
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:17,879
your leaves more than you do so even if

86
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:19,680
you have someone at your company like HR

87
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,530
who should know it's best to just assume

88
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:24,750
that they have no idea that what you're

89
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:26,760
entitled to and if you're wrong that's

90
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,230
great they can just confirm what you

91
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:30,780
already figured out but if you're right

92
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:33,660
then you can educate your company and

93
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:35,220
hopefully make it easier for the next

94
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:36,660
person at your company who goes through

95
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:40,950
this incidentally for me after I had my

96
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:42,450
son I found out that there was a

97
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:44,370
California maternity leave Facebook

98
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:46,380
group and I joined it even though by

99
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:48,390
that point I already knew what Levi was

100
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:50,099
entitled to because I was curious I

101
00:03:50,099 --> 00:03:51,959
wanted to see how much of it I got right

102
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:54,360
and how much of it I got wrong and if

103
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:57,390
you can see there are three over three

104
00:03:57,390 --> 00:03:59,160
thousand members of their group and the

105
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,269
moderators actually had to close down

106
00:04:00,269 --> 00:04:01,980
the group because they just don't have

107
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:03,870
enough time to answer everybody's

108
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:05,849
questions but the thing that you see

109
00:04:05,849 --> 00:04:07,440
being in this group over and over again

110
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:10,019
is that HR completely gets people's

111
00:04:10,019 --> 00:04:11,989
leaves wrong over and over again so

112
00:04:11,989 --> 00:04:14,400
again it's up to you to figure out what

113
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,750
leave you're entitled to because

114
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:17,479
knowledge is power

115
00:04:17,479 --> 00:04:20,039
so how do you figure out what leave

116
00:04:20,039 --> 00:04:23,250
you're actually entitled to so the first

117
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:25,800
thing that I did was of course Google

118
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:29,520
everything the second one the second way

119
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,349
that I went about researching was that I

120
00:04:31,349 --> 00:04:33,510
talked to my friends and I cross-checked

121
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:35,669
what I found on Google with what my

122
00:04:35,669 --> 00:04:37,289
friends at bigger companies with bigger

123
00:04:37,289 --> 00:04:39,539
HR departments had figured out by

124
00:04:39,539 --> 00:04:41,220
checking what you've already researched

125
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:44,550
with what bigger companies have said is

126
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:46,080
the policy you can be pretty sure if

127
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,610
they match that that's actually the

128
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:50,220
correct policy and then the third place

129
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:52,200
that I found information which won't

130
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,760
apply to anybody here but if you're in

131
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:56,160
California is the California state

132
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,080
disability website since that's where I

133
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,760
actually had to go and file all of my

134
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:00,650
paperwork

135
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:03,080
and so I know most of the audience here

136
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:06,350
is from South Korea so I'm not gonna

137
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:08,090
talk too much about what California

138
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:09,860
leave was but just wanted to give you

139
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:11,419
this image that helped me figure out

140
00:05:11,419 --> 00:05:14,810
what California leave was so at the top

141
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:16,880
we have a whole set of policies that

142
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:20,090
protect your job with no pay it's a mix

143
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:23,810
of federal and state policies and at the

144
00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:26,780
bottom we also have a mix of federal and

145
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:27,979
state policies but these are the

146
00:05:27,979 --> 00:05:30,169
policies that will actually pay you some

147
00:05:30,169 --> 00:05:32,570
amount of money and so it's totally

148
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:34,430
confusing if you didn't know that there

149
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:36,530
were state level policies you would

150
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:38,000
think that the federal level policies

151
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,039
which don't pay you anything and only

152
00:05:40,039 --> 00:05:41,419
give you job protection are the only

153
00:05:41,419 --> 00:05:43,610
things that exists there are also a

154
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:45,740
bunch of requirements that if they

155
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:47,090
aren't met you aren't entitled to

156
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:49,639
anything and so just it's a big mess and

157
00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:52,430
you really again should figure out what

158
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:55,039
your leave is and so with that I did a

159
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:57,020
little bit of googling about South

160
00:05:57,020 --> 00:06:01,310
Korean policy I'm by no means an expert

161
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:03,050
but this is what I was able to find out

162
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:06,349
so pregnant women are eligible for 90

163
00:06:06,349 --> 00:06:09,889
days of leave the first 60 are fully

164
00:06:09,889 --> 00:06:12,320
paid and the last 30 days are partially

165
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:15,950
paid and at least 45 of those have to be

166
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:18,099
taken after the birth of the baby

167
00:06:18,099 --> 00:06:20,690
fathers are entitled to five days of

168
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:23,539
print paternity leave and pregnant

169
00:06:23,539 --> 00:06:25,250
workers have rights to work two hours

170
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:28,520
less per day without a wage cut no

171
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:31,550
overtime nighttime or holiday work and

172
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:33,740
you also get medical exams during work

173
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:35,610
without and

174
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:39,810
any additional pay cuts the government

175
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:42,000
also provides monetary assistance to

176
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,050
expectant couples

177
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:45,210
such as vouchers for pregnancy checkups

178
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:46,650
which is pretty awesome because the u.s.

179
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:48,870
doesn't do anything like that the

180
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:50,039
government also provides monthly

181
00:06:50,039 --> 00:06:51,870
allowances to parents for the first year

182
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:53,610
after the child is born for other

183
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:56,639
related expenses as well and then

184
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:58,620
parents of children less than three

185
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:00,719
years old can request up to one year of

186
00:07:00,719 --> 00:07:03,090
full-time or part-time childcare leave

187
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:05,370
with a 30 day notice period which is

188
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:07,469
super awesome because that also is not

189
00:07:07,469 --> 00:07:10,440
available in the US and the best part of

190
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,060
this I thought was the free public

191
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:14,610
daycare that's available so there is the

192
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:16,560
wait time typically of one to two years

193
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,599
but if both parents work kids get to the

194
00:07:18,599 --> 00:07:19,740
jump to the front of the wait list

195
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:22,050
there's a ton more stuff but these were

196
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:23,580
just the highlights of what I was able

197
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:26,069
to find doing my research for this talk

198
00:07:26,069 --> 00:07:28,110
so make sure that again you figure out

199
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:31,469
what you're entitled to and this leads

200
00:07:31,469 --> 00:07:34,259
me to my next point which is take as

201
00:07:34,259 --> 00:07:36,360
much leave as you can afford to whether

202
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,650
you're the pregnant woman or their

203
00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:39,330
partner but especially if you're the

204
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:41,400
partner and I'm not saying this because

205
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,379
of the cliches around you'll never get

206
00:07:43,379 --> 00:07:45,389
this time back even though it's true I'm

207
00:07:45,389 --> 00:07:47,699
saying it because taking care of kids is

208
00:07:47,699 --> 00:07:49,469
really hard and having two people there

209
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:51,449
makes it way easier there are a lot of

210
00:07:51,449 --> 00:07:53,669
articles that talk about this but my

211
00:07:53,669 --> 00:07:57,089
favorite one was titled after a men in

212
00:07:57,089 --> 00:07:59,279
Spain got paternity leave they wanted

213
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:02,370
fewer kids and the best quote out of

214
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:05,279
here was Farah and Gonzalez think that

215
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:06,509
spending more time with their children

216
00:08:06,509 --> 00:08:09,719
or the prospect of having to do so may

217
00:08:09,719 --> 00:08:11,879
have made men more acutely aware of the

218
00:08:11,879 --> 00:08:13,529
effort and cost associated with

219
00:08:13,529 --> 00:08:14,279
child-rearing

220
00:08:14,279 --> 00:08:16,620
and as the researchers put it shifted

221
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:18,810
their preferences from child quantity to

222
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:21,300
quality so I realize not everyone can

223
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,909
afford to take time off but if you can

224
00:08:23,909 --> 00:08:25,500
afford to you won't regret taking that

225
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,419
time off your child your relationship

226
00:08:27,419 --> 00:08:29,729
will be so much less stressful because

227
00:08:29,729 --> 00:08:30,980
of it

228
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:34,190
so moving on to talking to your work

229
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:37,460
again when I got to this part I was

230
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:38,630
really nervous and I didn't really

231
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:41,930
understand why you know again shouldn't

232
00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:44,300
this be a happy thing but again the

233
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:45,800
problem is that people start making

234
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,870
assumptions as soon as they hear that

235
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:50,930
you're pregnant so for example this

236
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:53,510
article shows that children hurt woman's

237
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:55,280
earnings but not men's even in

238
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:57,140
Scandinavia which is one of the most

239
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:59,090
progressive countries out there there

240
00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:00,860
can be a lot of reasons for this people

241
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:02,210
might assume that you're going to just

242
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:04,130
end up staying at home or that you're

243
00:09:04,130 --> 00:09:05,840
not as motivated or that you don't want

244
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:08,480
to take on as challenging assignments

245
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,240
which you know usually is not the case

246
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:14,180
and so all of this is just to say that

247
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:16,940
it's totally normal to be nervous about

248
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:18,080
telling your company that you're

249
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:21,620
expecting a baby and so it wasn't until

250
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:23,540
after I talked to my friends that I

251
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:25,700
realized why this was something that I

252
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:27,920
was feeling so nervous about and like I

253
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,080
also want to take this chance to talk to

254
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,000
any managers out in the audience which

255
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,070
is that if you're on the receiving end

256
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:36,560
of this news you should be just super

257
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:40,340
excited this should be you and then once

258
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:41,870
the dust is settled just go back to

259
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:43,550
treating the person who told you

260
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:45,890
normally the greatest gift that my

261
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:47,750
manager and co-workers gave me at the

262
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:48,260
time

263
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:49,880
after I told them was treating the fact

264
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,340
that I was pregnant as no bigger deal

265
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:53,810
than the fact that I had brown eyes it

266
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:56,180
just didn't matter to them the only

267
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:57,650
thing that they did do was they stopped

268
00:09:57,650 --> 00:09:59,600
offering me beer when we got to lunch

269
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,180
and dinner so with that said there's no

270
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:04,460
hard or fast rules for when and how you

271
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:06,020
should tell your company so I just

272
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:07,640
wanted to give a few tips that worked

273
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,000
for me

274
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,819
so for me I would definitely repeat

275
00:10:11,819 --> 00:10:13,709
telling them as soon as I was

276
00:10:13,709 --> 00:10:15,899
comfortable there may or may not be a

277
00:10:15,899 --> 00:10:18,389
minimal notice period for you there

278
00:10:18,389 --> 00:10:20,819
definitely is in the u.s. of course if

279
00:10:20,819 --> 00:10:22,410
you're the person who's pregnant you're

280
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:24,120
probably an entire company way more than

281
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:26,629
the 30-day minimum requirement in the US

282
00:10:26,629 --> 00:10:29,490
but even if you're the partner it's a

283
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:31,079
lot easier to explain why you're

284
00:10:31,079 --> 00:10:33,240
suddenly needing to take all of these

285
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:35,220
morning's off to go to appointments and

286
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:36,839
everything people will wonder if

287
00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:38,100
something is something wrong with you if

288
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:39,389
you're like I need to be going to

289
00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:41,459
doctors appointments regularly if they

290
00:10:41,459 --> 00:10:42,839
don't know that you're going because

291
00:10:42,839 --> 00:10:44,819
you're seeing the doctor for your future

292
00:10:44,819 --> 00:10:49,470
baby I would also repeat talking to your

293
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:52,019
HR I'm not sure how widespread HR people

294
00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:54,389
are in South Korea but if you have

295
00:10:54,389 --> 00:10:56,160
someone who manages these kind of things

296
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,959
definitely talk to them along with your

297
00:10:57,959 --> 00:10:59,850
manager I had a really supportive

298
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:01,829
manager so I actually told him before we

299
00:11:01,829 --> 00:11:03,750
talked to HR and this was also a really

300
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:06,029
good time to figure out if my company

301
00:11:06,029 --> 00:11:08,220
would be willing to pay anything while I

302
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:10,439
was gone and as luck would have it they

303
00:11:10,439 --> 00:11:12,480
ended up supplementing my income for

304
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,089
twelve weeks so I had full salary for 12

305
00:11:15,089 --> 00:11:16,769
weeks which is not the case for a lot of

306
00:11:16,769 --> 00:11:19,910
people in the US or even California

307
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:22,220
also keep copies of all correspondence

308
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:25,240
regarding your leave and job performance

309
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:27,620
while you're out on maternity leave or

310
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:29,180
paternity leave you don't want to

311
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:31,580
suddenly be let go of your job without

312
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:33,350
any sort of evidence that this was

313
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:34,880
actually something that your company

314
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,010
said was ok and approved of you're not

315
00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:38,360
necessarily going to have access to your

316
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:41,090
email anymore so whether it's printing

317
00:11:41,090 --> 00:11:42,800
out emails or forwarding it to yourself

318
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,710
just you know have something to show

319
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:49,190
that this was approved before and for me

320
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:52,310
about it for talking to your company so

321
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:54,860
we're gonna move on to gearing up for

322
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:56,780
your baby this is gonna be a little

323
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:58,430
different than most of the lists that

324
00:11:58,430 --> 00:11:59,870
you see out there related to getting

325
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:02,060
ready for baby which are usually things

326
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:03,680
that you should and shouldn't buy you

327
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,050
can totally Google all of that so that's

328
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:08,090
not what this is going to be it's mostly

329
00:12:08,090 --> 00:12:09,770
a list of things that I have observed

330
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:12,050
about being pregnant and which someone

331
00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:15,830
had told me about so first up if you're

332
00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:17,210
the person who's pregnant you're gonna

333
00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:19,190
be more tired than you've ever been in

334
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:21,470
your first trimester you might not

335
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:23,750
realize just how tired that is for me I

336
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:26,300
worked two blocks from the beach when I

337
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:28,130
was pregnant and I seriously considered

338
00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:30,530
for about a month straight walking to

339
00:12:30,530 --> 00:12:32,570
the beach during lunch time taking a nap

340
00:12:32,570 --> 00:12:34,070
and then heading back to work that's how

341
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:36,620
tired I was so again another thing I

342
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:38,630
didn't realize was normal but it totally

343
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:41,580
is so just be ready

344
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:43,920
also you're gonna outgrow every piece of

345
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,140
clothing you have towards the end even

346
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:47,430
your maternity clothes

347
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:49,470
this really depressed me no one warned

348
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:51,720
me about this it's normal just go to

349
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,760
your local thrift shop and buy some

350
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,649
really big pieces of clothing to tide

351
00:12:55,649 --> 00:12:56,970
you over for the last month and you'll

352
00:12:56,970 --> 00:13:00,089
be good this was me a week before my son

353
00:13:00,089 --> 00:13:01,529
came I don't know if you can tell but

354
00:13:01,529 --> 00:13:03,690
that fabric is not holding together very

355
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:08,820
well also now's the time to start

356
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:10,560
talking to your employer about setting

357
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,480
them up a mother's room if you plan to

358
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,060
breastfeed so where I worked like a lot

359
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:16,440
of startups they had an open floor plan

360
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:19,380
the only rooms that were available were

361
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:22,019
conference rooms that had glass walls so

362
00:13:22,019 --> 00:13:23,640
clearly that wouldn't work as a mother's

363
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:25,560
room and so it's good to give your

364
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,630
company some lead time to make changes

365
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:28,890
so that you can have an appropriate

366
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:32,310
mother's room if that's what you need so

367
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:34,350
I want to also take this time to talk

368
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:36,149
about South Korea's breastfeeding right

369
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:41,160
so there's only 18.3% as of 2016

370
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:43,649
breastfed Fred excuse me

371
00:13:43,649 --> 00:13:46,110
breastfed exclusively until six months

372
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:48,690
while the global average is 41%

373
00:13:48,690 --> 00:13:51,089
even though 95 percent of mothers

374
00:13:51,089 --> 00:13:53,220
breastfeed immediately after birth in an

375
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:55,290
earlier months and the biggest reasons

376
00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:57,690
that that rate was so low were that

377
00:13:57,690 --> 00:13:59,579
there is either no more milk or that

378
00:13:59,579 --> 00:14:02,220
they didn't think it was any necessary

379
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:04,980
any longer or work conditions so the

380
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:06,630
fact that we're conditions is along the

381
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:08,790
top three reasons for why women stop

382
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:10,500
breastfeeding is why it's really

383
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,000
important to talk to your company about

384
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,440
getting a mother's room if that is

385
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,720
important to you

386
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:18,480
so with that said this is my realistic

387
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,130
mother's room obviously in a start-up

388
00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:21,450
you're always strapped for cash so I

389
00:14:21,450 --> 00:14:23,520
can't just give you my pie in the sky

390
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:26,520
dream mother's room but for me oh the

391
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:27,660
minimum that you would want to have a

392
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:30,449
good mother's room is a lock that only

393
00:14:30,449 --> 00:14:32,459
the pumping moms have access to because

394
00:14:32,459 --> 00:14:34,260
I had to kick out people so many times

395
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:37,149
that I got super tired of it

396
00:14:37,149 --> 00:14:39,100
curtains and blinds over the windows and

397
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:40,660
I need glass walls that's sort of

398
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:42,610
obvious but something that needs to be

399
00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:44,740
said comfy chairs because you're gonna

400
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:46,420
be sitting in there for a long time

401
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:49,570
everyday and office chairs just aren't

402
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:52,209
comfortable a fridge to store punk milk

403
00:14:52,209 --> 00:14:54,850
and pump parts because people get a

404
00:14:54,850 --> 00:14:56,470
little weird when you store your Pumped

405
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:58,029
milk with their lunch for whatever

406
00:14:58,029 --> 00:15:00,970
reason even though it's both food also

407
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:03,220
if there are multiple women pumping it

408
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:04,839
would be really nice to have lockers so

409
00:15:04,839 --> 00:15:07,000
people can store all of their pump stuff

410
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,260
in there without having to lug it all

411
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:11,470
around and if privacy partitions or

412
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:13,120
cubicles if you only have one room

413
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,550
available and if you only have one room

414
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:17,470
available and can't do anything about it

415
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:19,089
then at least have a calendar for

416
00:15:19,089 --> 00:15:21,130
scheduling their room and then finally

417
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:23,620
bonus points first Inc because you might

418
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:25,510
have to wash some of your pump stuff and

419
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:27,040
people get really weird about you

420
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,079
washing again your pump stuff in the

421
00:15:29,079 --> 00:15:30,339
same sink where they're washing other

422
00:15:30,339 --> 00:15:31,930
really gross things but they don't think

423
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:34,540
it's as gross as your your breast milk

424
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:39,280
so I think is really nice too

425
00:15:39,290 --> 00:15:42,350
so moving on something that I would do

426
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:45,050
totally differently is not keeping on

427
00:15:45,050 --> 00:15:46,730
top of my employer once I filed for

428
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:48,650
disability so this is a little

429
00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:50,570
California specific I'm not sure if

430
00:15:50,570 --> 00:15:52,310
there's paperwork that your employer

431
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:54,110
needs to sign when you're going to go

432
00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:55,700
out on maternity or paternity leave

433
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:58,550
but for California there is and I didn't

434
00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:00,020
pay attention to the mail I was getting

435
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:01,370
and it turns out that my claim was

436
00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:02,000
denied

437
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,310
I only had 21 days to repeal it and I

438
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:06,260
didn't realize it until I was about 14

439
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:08,570
days in so I was holding my two-week old

440
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:11,030
on hold for hours at a time multiple

441
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:13,610
times a day trying to talk to a real

442
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:15,380
person so definitely don't recommend it

443
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:17,510
if there's paperwork that your employer

444
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:19,850
or really anyone needs signed just make

445
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:21,380
sure that you keep track of that before

446
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:25,100
the baby's born another thing that I

447
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:27,050
would not do again is that I didn't get

448
00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:29,930
on the daycare waitlist early enough so

449
00:16:29,930 --> 00:16:33,350
when I went to my first daycare visit I

450
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:35,480
was four months pregnant I thought that

451
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:37,520
was plenty of time and then the woman

452
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:39,890
who was doing the tour asked me so are

453
00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:41,660
you pregnant yet and I thought that she

454
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:43,490
was kidding until I found out that the

455
00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:45,830
waitlist was fifteen months long and as

456
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:48,050
I pointed out earlier the wait lists for

457
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:50,630
daycares in South Korea can run up to

458
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:52,580
one or two years so if you can do

459
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:54,980
anything ahead of time make sure that

460
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:57,530
you get on that list as soon as possible

461
00:16:57,530 --> 00:16:59,690
and this isn't to say that there's not

462
00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:01,550
going to be a spot in a daycare

463
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:03,890
somewhere but all of the top rated ones

464
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:05,959
are always filled up way in advance and

465
00:17:05,959 --> 00:17:07,100
so those are the ones that I'm really

466
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:09,429
talking about

467
00:17:09,429 --> 00:17:11,449
something that I would do again is

468
00:17:11,449 --> 00:17:13,939
joining my local Facebook baby gear

469
00:17:13,939 --> 00:17:16,699
resale group I don't know if Facebook is

470
00:17:16,699 --> 00:17:19,100
used as widely here but if you have any

471
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:21,919
sort of social media or groups where

472
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:24,470
people share have shared interests I

473
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:26,509
would definitely look for shared groups

474
00:17:26,509 --> 00:17:28,129
because people would solve these big

475
00:17:28,129 --> 00:17:31,070
garbage bags of baby clothes for $25

476
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:32,720
because they wanted to get rid of it and

477
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,820
get something for it it saved me and my

478
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:36,679
husband a ton of money so definitely

479
00:17:36,679 --> 00:17:39,639
look into that you're having a baby soon

480
00:17:39,639 --> 00:17:42,769
also this was something that was totally

481
00:17:42,769 --> 00:17:44,480
out of left field for me but if you want

482
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,730
newborn photos schedule it now for the

483
00:17:46,730 --> 00:17:49,190
sleepy two-week period in the first two

484
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:51,470
weeks baby sleep through everything uh I

485
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:53,600
think a car could like explode and they

486
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,059
would still stay asleep this is the best

487
00:17:56,059 --> 00:17:57,529
time for them to take pictures but it's

488
00:17:57,529 --> 00:18:00,139
also the time when photographers are

489
00:18:00,139 --> 00:18:01,999
super full because that's when the best

490
00:18:01,999 --> 00:18:03,440
pictures come out so if this is

491
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,330
something you want to do make sure that

492
00:18:05,330 --> 00:18:06,740
you find a photographer that you like

493
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:10,759
and book them now so the last thing that

494
00:18:10,759 --> 00:18:12,710
I wouldn't do is starting a big

495
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:14,600
remodeling project when my due date was

496
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:17,149
less than two months away so you might

497
00:18:17,149 --> 00:18:19,309
laugh and wonder who would decide to do

498
00:18:19,309 --> 00:18:21,110
a big renovation when they're pregnant

499
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:22,909
and the answer is a lot of people

500
00:18:22,909 --> 00:18:26,299
including me him a husband this is what

501
00:18:26,299 --> 00:18:28,220
our master bathroom looked like 50 days

502
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:30,830
from when I was due and there's

503
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:32,720
something about knowing that a baby's

504
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,999
coming and that wanting to make sure

505
00:18:34,999 --> 00:18:37,279
that your space is a good space for them

506
00:18:37,279 --> 00:18:39,289
to grow up in as well as knowing how

507
00:18:39,289 --> 00:18:42,169
much harder is gonna be to remodel once

508
00:18:42,169 --> 00:18:43,460
the baby's here that makes a lot of

509
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:45,409
people decide to suddenly do big

510
00:18:45,409 --> 00:18:47,210
construction projects right before the

511
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:49,129
baby's due I know at least two other

512
00:18:49,129 --> 00:18:50,629
people who did it around the same time

513
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:52,879
as me and none of them including ours

514
00:18:52,879 --> 00:18:54,889
finished on time because babies are

515
00:18:54,889 --> 00:18:56,899
generally on time whereas construction

516
00:18:56,899 --> 00:18:59,269
projects generally aren't and as much as

517
00:18:59,269 --> 00:19:00,860
you might think you need to upgrade your

518
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:02,720
kitchen or your bathroom now it just

519
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,730
adds a bunch of struts that you really

520
00:19:04,730 --> 00:19:07,570
don't need so don't do it

521
00:19:07,570 --> 00:19:11,720
so the last section is babies here

522
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:14,270
hooray the first few days in the

523
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:16,580
hospital were such a blur for me that I

524
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:18,260
was really grateful that I got to stay

525
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:19,970
in the hospital for four days because

526
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:22,280
there the nurses do everything for you

527
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:24,260
and then I remember when we were leaving

528
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:26,510
the hospital thinking are they seriously

529
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:28,160
letting me a person who doesn't know

530
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,350
anything just take this helpless tiny

531
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:32,360
little thing home yep

532
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:35,230
they are congratulations you're a parent

533
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:37,120
don't panic

534
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:39,170
just kidding your new parent you're

535
00:19:39,170 --> 00:19:41,720
gonna panic about everything so all I

536
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:44,500
can say is just breathe it'll be okay I

537
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:48,230
also found out a few surprising things

538
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:49,640
about life with a newborn that I

539
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:52,070
couldn't find on Google anywhere and if

540
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:53,720
someone had told me this I would have

541
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:55,010
felt a lot better knowing that

542
00:19:55,010 --> 00:19:57,560
everything was normal so I'm gonna tell

543
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:59,750
let you in on a few of those things I

544
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:02,180
found out so you have to know waking

545
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:04,130
newborns up every three hours to feed

546
00:20:04,130 --> 00:20:06,110
them if they don't wake themselves up

547
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:09,980
they this totally blew my mind like

548
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:11,330
knowing that I would have to be up every

549
00:20:11,330 --> 00:20:13,280
three hours because the baby woke me up

550
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,530
was already pretty bad but then

551
00:20:15,530 --> 00:20:16,880
realizing that I'd have to set my own

552
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,920
alarm and wake ourselves off was just

553
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,930
torturous but it's just something that

554
00:20:20,930 --> 00:20:23,480
you're gonna have to do so just be

555
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:25,860
prepared and sleep a lot now

556
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:28,090
also babies don't like to sleep by

557
00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:29,680
themselves they love sleeping in your

558
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:33,070
arms so in the US we use cribs pretty

559
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:35,230
much everybody's crib was unused for the

560
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:37,300
first three months including ours so the

561
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:38,770
good news is that if you haven't put

562
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:40,270
together whatever it is that you

563
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:42,070
typically put your baby to sleep in

564
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:44,620
you've got lots of time the bad news is

565
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:45,670
you're not gonna get to sleep at all

566
00:20:45,670 --> 00:20:46,960
because you're going to just be holding

567
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,190
this baby while they're sleeping and

568
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:49,510
hoping that they don't wake up

569
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:52,120
but again just be prepared and know that

570
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:54,870
it's normal

571
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,910
also babies have a superhuman ability to

572
00:20:57,910 --> 00:20:59,680
detect when you're trying to sit down so

573
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,510
remember you have to wake yourself up

574
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:04,090
every three hours to feed them and then

575
00:21:04,090 --> 00:21:05,740
put them back to sleep they won't let

576
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:07,300
you sit down when you're doing that you

577
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:09,430
have to keep walking back and forth back

578
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:11,320
and forth even though you think that

579
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:13,180
they're asleep the second you start

580
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:15,190
squatting into a sitting position they

581
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:17,740
will wake right up so just again be

582
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:19,060
prepared and know you're gonna be doing

583
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:20,620
a lot of walking back and forth in the

584
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:22,900
dark so those were the three biggest

585
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:24,340
surprising things about life with

586
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:26,080
newborns I have a ton more but I don't

587
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,520
have enough time to talk about them so

588
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,960
come find me if you want to find out

589
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,720
more of the things that I figure it out

590
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,850
I have I also had some advice that I

591
00:21:33,850 --> 00:21:35,290
wish I could have given to my former

592
00:21:35,290 --> 00:21:37,240
self which is that the first six weeks

593
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:39,730
are a huge roller coaster they're way

594
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:41,410
harder than anyone ever warns you about

595
00:21:41,410 --> 00:21:43,450
I think I cried maybe every other day

596
00:21:43,450 --> 00:21:45,160
it's totally normal

597
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,870
the thing is no one tells you until

598
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:48,700
you're talking to them about it and so

599
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:51,280
I'm here to tell you it's normal but

600
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,380
also be on the lookout for signs of

601
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:55,420
postpartum depression there's it affects

602
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:57,490
a lot more women and even some men then

603
00:21:57,490 --> 00:21:59,530
you would realize and so make sure that

604
00:21:59,530 --> 00:22:00,790
you're checking yourself and your

605
00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:03,160
partner for that also breastfeeding is

606
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:05,440
harder than anyone tells you big part of

607
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,850
why I cried every other day for the

608
00:22:06,850 --> 00:22:08,800
first six weeks it's normal and it's

609
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,510
okay to feel like you have no idea what

610
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:12,100
you're doing but it's also okay to

611
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:14,820
decide if you want to stop

612
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:17,530
also say no to everybody who wants to

613
00:22:17,530 --> 00:22:19,360
come over in the first six weeks it's

614
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,160
really hard feeling like you have to

615
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:23,170
clean everything up and play hostess

616
00:22:23,170 --> 00:22:25,600
tour host when you're super tired you're

617
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,820
not feeling good about yourself but if

618
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:29,380
you're not able to actually say no to

619
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:31,450
people it's feel free to take a nap when

620
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:32,800
people come over you don't have to

621
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,390
entertain them that's what the babies

622
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:36,430
for just throw the baby at them go to

623
00:22:36,430 --> 00:22:39,520
sleep and the last thing is it

624
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:42,190
excuse me it's okay to put the baby down

625
00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:44,440
in a safe space and walk away for a few

626
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:46,600
minutes if you need to compose yourself

627
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:49,179
so I had a friend tell me that and I

628
00:22:49,179 --> 00:22:50,140
didn't really understand what she was

629
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:52,000
talking about until I was feeling super

630
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,890
overwhelmed one day and having that

631
00:22:53,890 --> 00:22:56,020
permission was really helpful so I'm

632
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:57,730
giving all of you permission to do that

633
00:22:57,730 --> 00:23:02,290
as well I lied this is the last part so

634
00:23:02,290 --> 00:23:04,929
everyone's gonna have advice feel free

635
00:23:04,929 --> 00:23:07,030
to ignore everything that people say

636
00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:08,650
including what I'm saying and all of us

637
00:23:08,650 --> 00:23:11,290
talk and just do what you want so hold

638
00:23:11,290 --> 00:23:12,880
your baby as much as you want or not

639
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:16,120
sleep train or not restrict screen time

640
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:20,830
or not do what works for your family so

641
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:22,750
I do have one last section but going

642
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:25,210
back to work could be its own whole talk

643
00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:29,040
so I just have a few survival tips

644
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:31,680
number one be gentle with yourself the

645
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:34,980
first few days weeks months years are

646
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:36,810
tough for everyone and even if you're

647
00:23:36,810 --> 00:23:38,610
super excited to be back at work it's

648
00:23:38,610 --> 00:23:41,490
okay to feel weird now that you don't

649
00:23:41,490 --> 00:23:44,060
have a baby attached to your hip 24/7

650
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:46,350
also don't expect to be a hundred

651
00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:48,180
percent right away you're gonna think

652
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:49,410
that everyone thinks that you're behind

653
00:23:49,410 --> 00:23:51,510
are going too slow it's not true and if

654
00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:52,980
that is what you're thinking that is not

655
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:56,580
the best place to work anyway I don't

656
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:58,560
know if working remotely is super

657
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:01,830
widespread here but if you can work

658
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:02,580
remotely

659
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:04,380
when possible it just makes things a lot

660
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:07,590
easier for me I remember when I had a

661
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:09,600
one hour commute each way and I would

662
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:10,800
just spend time sitting in traffic

663
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,600
thinking like I could be at home hanging

664
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,280
out with my kid right now so if you can

665
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:17,160
reduce your traffic time or anything

666
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,930
like that working remotely is really

667
00:24:18,930 --> 00:24:21,390
great also if you have to travel there

668
00:24:21,390 --> 00:24:23,760
are milk shipping services that exists I

669
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,320
did not know about this at all at

670
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:27,660
luckily I didn't need it but you can

671
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:29,040
pump milk if you're on a business trip

672
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,660
and then ship it back to your house so

673
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:33,120
whoever is taking care of your baby can

674
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,920
actually continue to feed them your milk

675
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,780
if that's what you want to do and then

676
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:39,090
finally put your life on easy mode so

677
00:24:39,090 --> 00:24:41,850
whether that's getting takeout delivery

678
00:24:41,850 --> 00:24:43,830
of toilet paper and everything using

679
00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:45,660
paper plates forks so you don't have to

680
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:48,150
do dishes you know just do everything

681
00:24:48,150 --> 00:24:49,710
that you can you're in survival mode for

682
00:24:49,710 --> 00:24:51,270
at least the first six months do

683
00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:53,460
everything that you can can to make your

684
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:56,040
life easy I have about a million more

685
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:59,070
tips like I said but I am out of time so

686
00:24:59,070 --> 00:25:02,220
if you have any questions or comments my

687
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:03,780
