1
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:19,950
well then as they presented there I read to him 

2
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:23,280
of today's talk is to talk a little bit that it won't be because we all came to

3
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:27,180
we learn to learn what is good we come in the afternoon we have a

4
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:31,110
lots of amazing talks of new experiments to do maybe you get

5
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:35,940
it is but better a little bit of hindsight think a little bit I want

6
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:42,210
do and that well to zero put in mind a little things to think to improve

7
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:45,950
our project twice to see in his vice president

8
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:49,790
engineering on the side we are a digital agency that we offer different

9
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:55,460
more services now targeting products it's very interesting how they get

10
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:58,820
new projects we find new solutions for those projects and the

11
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:02,990
customers are happy and more users which is the end goal is

12
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:06,710
found in at blunk on twitter is ever on

13
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:10,100
this talk is going to be after everyone jennifer serves after they can't look

14
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:15,350
there quietly and any questions like that is to buy as twitter to

15
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:19,490
for questions or whatever you like afterwards we chat

16
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:23,119
first I wanted to congratulate the guys who organized the first one with faith in

17
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:29,530
Argentina, so congratulations for all of us, we are here to talk about the ss, no

18
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:37,980
994 a propellant that the css for the future we had html that were texts

19
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:41,970
a text document but you had to put a little color, notice that in

20
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:49,210
1,094 already think about this parameter not font-size x 3 we look

21
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:55,310
but hey this was already played in 924 it will be that the blue color in the links

22
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:59,650
I had more conversion I was looking for more people and things I don't know

23
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:05,110
and there we go to these incredible places like science like Argentina which is

24
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:09,369
a marketing landing let's say sell sell the event what information

25
00:02:09,369 --> 00:02:11,710
event who will come to chat who will do things

26
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:15,340
animations amazing things that made a site so we're

27
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:19,030
working fox sports is a news portal huge amount of articles

28
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:22,120
information that needs to be done and there are a lot of things that we have to keep in

29
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:25,960
account when we generate a site or not and then a

30
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:32,130
also toad marketing landing which is what speaks a little one is

31
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:37,209
bring the web to the future a novelty if you do not know the site we made a

32
00:02:37,209 --> 00:02:40,569
animations system with that you see that with canvas that was very interesting

33
00:02:40,569 --> 00:02:44,709
develop it later if the client let's say it was what I expected I don't know

34
00:02:44,709 --> 00:02:49,440
but internally I felt it was very interesting development at least

35
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:56,080
then we go back to css the voters in the same sector as they reached a

36
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:03,250
element how to customize the properties ok color text by case all good

37
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:07,870
and then we have this our code not that they care because it can't get to

38
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:14,200
the class because he was not in charge it was possible and then

39
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:17,980
I don't know what class convention to use but then I put many classes

40
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:22,860
because to be able to step on the previous one because it did not send everything very well

41
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:29,520
and we finished everything and well nothing came out bye bye I know if it hits like we say

42
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:36,150
then let's not try that cash face back once good what

43
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:41,460
let's try to think why this happens how can we improve a little bit all of our

44
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:45,450
flow of our project so that this is not so common at least and improve

45
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:49,860
all day is a little more the first thing to improve and what not to do is improve

46
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:53,640
our communication as a team as designers as developers as the

47
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:56,880
rest of the team product nerz the customer who wants the customer who wants

48
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:00,150
designer show on the site what we as developers want

49
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:04,920
implement some technology see that we can do it then love

50
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:07,770
among the entire team project managers client producers

51
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:12,000
we are all together developing something that we have to deliver but as

52
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,560
team then basic things that are good to come and that not always

53
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:21,090
happen in the projects so I want to do well if I ask for a little

54
00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:26,220
not to the designer who has in mind what the customer wants, who wants the

55
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:30,120
next what is your objective sometimes many times the target browser is getting very

56
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:33,480
good to have stack analytics chay who are your most common browsers

57
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:36,980
so we make sure that 70% of users have the best experience

58
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:41,850
now if we still do a we have a bug in just a browser a

59
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:46,770
intra explorer x that because we use with banking and people usually use it good

60
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:51,470
let's make sure cool so no one has let's say

61
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:57,650
the top percentile has resolution book device errors this by

62
00:04:57,650 --> 00:05:00,800
example the first thing if the structure hd me the wire flips they have in mind

63
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,400
have layout how it works which models i'm going to use how many pages are

64
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:09,050
perhaps it is a landing and it is simpler in collar they do not need to climb as much in

65
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:13,430
terms of models and modules but suddenly we have many and we have to start

66
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:17,330
to reuse them and think what variations they will have and if we have it from the

67
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:22,040
first moment or something similar to what you are going to do one is going to start

68
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:25,990
to understand how to separate those components how to start working them a little better

69
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:31,550
this what a bit of analytics said not ok chrome 74 percent of users

70
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:36,230
good public then well let's make sure that public receives the best that

71
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:39,440
we can maybe I can use branding box to stand out a little bit more 70 percent

72
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:43,880
of users you can probably see that work that dedication of

73
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:48,290
more than we are going to give you then keep this in mind especially resolutions

74
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:50,810
it is also to be able to make a good vat on those people who are going to receive that

75
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:54,880
product then that site then

76
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:58,240
one thing that always happens is the site is dynamic all sites are

77
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:03,220
dynamic dynamic to the point of responsive I don't even want to say that I

78
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:07,240
Yes, I am going to make response sites and it is not mandatory, that is, mobile and today

79
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:12,370
occupies a minimum of 50 percent of the traffic but more in some places it reaches

80
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:15,730
up to 70 80 percent mobile then this is not an option you have to

81
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:19,020
be like this have to be well have to have half a room what is necessary

82
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:22,780
even now we are running around the base for about a year we start with

83
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:26,680
this design mobile first we design Ã¡lava mobile and then

84
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:30,460
we start with progress enhancement to progressively improve the experience

85
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:34,810
user while the screen is enlarged then the component by

86
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:38,560
example button without any media query is actually the button as you would see in

87
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:42,160
mobile with the size will have for example the background image the

88
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,670
background color and it will have it by default and then just when

89
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:48,190
we start adding media queries we'll see how that button will behave

90
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:52,180
in the different sizes when we are enlarging before formerly we started

91
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:56,100
shrink it in the distance here the work the idea or what I propose is

92
00:06:56,100 --> 00:07:00,639
let's start doing it the other way around the component alone is mobile

93
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:04,749
afterwards it is always this we talk about dynamism does not follow clients and new

94
00:07:04,749 --> 00:07:09,279
guys add two buttons that lead to the form link to buy the

95
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:12,159
science entries with easy have a great day and a Sunday morning and you

96
00:07:12,159 --> 00:07:17,439
They get up early but then he comes and says no but Sergio the button has

97
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:21,699
to be red well the problem I come red color and we are all

98
00:07:21,699 --> 00:07:26,199
happy and I give it to you is so much on the page

99
00:07:26,199 --> 00:07:30,980
yes but sergio was not the one below who wanted red not the one above

100
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:34,190
all clients always sometimes don't communicate well back the system

101
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:38,300
communication or it is a matter of perhaps one is experimenting with the site while

102
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:42,620
find things so if you think it's the beginning code and start

103
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:46,360
add classes or a bit of selectors how is the best way to work

104
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:51,310
we do that if we do something like that

105
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:56,740
they see us much better we are all happy the client knows that the button

106
00:07:56,740 --> 00:08:00,970
bottom is red is well above is the other color if at first the top

107
00:08:00,970 --> 00:08:03,759
We were going to put the red button on it and we are going to have problems because it should have done

108
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:07,930
after blue and the clip changes decision so if we have a code

109
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:11,349
clean it will be simpler material later but it has the same too

110
00:08:11,349 --> 00:08:16,569
it comes with the content now we have to translate it and it's not there

111
00:08:16,569 --> 00:08:21,529
more button is I am a button for example we want at the end

112
00:08:21,529 --> 00:08:27,499
I'm a button and dot dot dot and we have to make sure that our

113
00:08:27,499 --> 00:08:30,709
components are scalable not only on responsible but also on

114
00:08:30,709 --> 00:08:34,159
content and this often happens that guy we are not going but I had put a

115
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:40,009
fixed height and when doing breaks because they are two lines etcetera then well that

116
00:08:40,009 --> 00:08:43,999
It is one of the things that we say usually happens at another point in its structure

117
00:08:43,999 --> 00:08:47,629
To generate a scalable and maintainable site in the future, it is necessary to generate with

118
00:08:47,629 --> 00:08:52,089
a good structure a structure where using

119
00:08:52,089 --> 00:08:55,210
processors that I think that today we should all use for the chips that

120
00:08:55,210 --> 00:09:00,250
brings no matter what styles it has that no matter how important it is that

121
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:04,660
features you need from each of them sometimes for example I think it is

122
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:08,589
basic is to be able to divide our code into multiple files in order to have

123
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:12,610
a much more maintainable code and that we know I have to modify the button

124
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:16,240
ok I go to the file the button and I touch that file and that should be everything

125
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,720
well then for example we have these sc which is the main thing

126
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:23,230
where the rest of my components don't matter

127
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:27,100
bartz where could you bring for example ok the customer said the blue or the

128
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:30,710
designer said blue was this blue but suddenly there was

129
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:37,340
instead styles and they changed the brand and suddenly blue well this time blue blue

130
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:41,620
then we have a file of the component itself

131
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:45,670
a file structure also in terms of folders which what are

132
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:49,990
components what are layouts what are bases what are profits by

133
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:52,630
example goes like this I found a mix insights that is very good and that I use

134
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:57,750
all the good time I bring it and save it as my utilities for example

135
00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:01,170
then being very tidy of these points help that later in the future

136
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:05,420
our our site is much easier to maintain

137
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:09,860
and I think this is one of the most important things about this is

138
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:13,820
set your rules set rules for a project don't let a project be

139
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:18,440
loose as the pokemons through the city of Buenos Aires that this a jungle not

140
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:24,079
decide what the rule is going to be there have to be rules in this but define the

141
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:28,790
Yours one of the great point six that is spoken is if that is not if it is because

142
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:33,589
skate which is one of the big chips of 7 I hope very careful with this

143
00:10:33,589 --> 00:10:37,700
because we end up with things like these that heather main generates inside in

144
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:42,740
the one why we have to speak a submenu of the submenu and but that had to

145
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:48,019
take it out of collection and we end up with things like that then just as is the great

146
00:10:48,019 --> 00:10:53,740
ssc figure is a great danger also in the future for a maintainable site

147
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:59,959
that's when we see those select ones we are a little scared that's why it's

148
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:03,920
important to generate rules for example the voters and money but as

149
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:08,959
let's call our constituents it's the same if you use is max ven or ss

150
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:14,269
it's irrelevant I chose one or some kind of rule up to a set of rules that you

151
00:11:14,269 --> 00:11:19,360
serve you and your team and your project and if it is necessary to throw it away and we have what

152
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:23,170
because we are a team but as long as there is consensus and we all maintain the

153
00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:26,800
same project rules we are sure that always going forward is going to

154
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:30,580
keep it the same way things like this will happen or you have to create a

155
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:35,650
new color as I put it I have gray gray stronger gray lighter good

156
00:11:35,650 --> 00:11:44,130
light gray but not so light because it's a new color and you're done with this

157
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:49,089
and then guys racing his head again he says

158
00:11:49,089 --> 00:11:53,769
sometimes tooling helps a lot in modern sites in our project

159
00:11:53,769 --> 00:11:56,699
modern we use many

160
00:11:56,889 --> 00:12:01,929
workflows with lots of your link with google with others with with web groups to

161
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:05,679
that any these and some things that we can integrate our workflow by

162
00:12:05,679 --> 00:12:09,730
example which are the cute ones the cute ones basically ensure that the rules that

163
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:13,839
we define are met then if we decide that a property has two

164
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:17,649
points and then a space after the property value make sure that in

165
00:12:17,649 --> 00:12:22,749
all sides the same occurs to see the example that is half naive perhaps not

166
00:12:22,749 --> 00:12:27,069
it's a good guy is the space that matters if it's a space that matters but

167
00:12:27,069 --> 00:12:30,999
after we have type 300 components 20 of them because our

168
00:12:30,999 --> 00:12:34,629
site started to scale and the customer needs new needs once they

169
00:12:34,629 --> 00:12:38,889
let's see that any developer who grabs site will read the code much more

170
00:12:38,889 --> 00:12:43,419
easy is not going to start losing where was this or what was happening

171
00:12:43,419 --> 00:12:48,949
with it and something very important I think that only

172
00:12:48,949 --> 00:12:56,030
because the talks calls that they don't do the css and this is important to us

173
00:12:56,030 --> 00:13:01,340
the importance of being the easy solution to I don't have time to find a way

174
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:06,320
correct to do it and I have to clean and I make important the house marÃ­a

175
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:10,520
so let's try to avoid using it and sometimes if we use it we even let

176
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:13,820
some documentation of why its use is important

177
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:20,030
let's try to use iris won't use and excuse lawyer let's think of some

178
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:23,270
modular way the air is something that cannot be repeated is only once in the

179
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:27,170
site imagine if this is why we have to repeat it because back there was

180
00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:32,000
changes is dynamic the world the embi had only one but then we got

181
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,630
we said it is very good it is working very well let's put another one we have to do

182
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:40,090
a reactor is to throw everything back and that can be a problem

183
00:13:40,090 --> 00:13:45,380
It wants to show a little this that we have been talking about with a module that we have here

184
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:51,410
we have a letter that has an image a title a text and that later we have

185
00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:56,750
a component that has the item ticket and various options then not

186
00:13:56,750 --> 00:14:02,960
we go a little to the ccs that we would have here very simple we have the letter that inside

187
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:08,900
It has an h 3 image and content, but in rated it is remove it behaves

188
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:11,740
another way because although the content is not displayed

189
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:15,550
now what problems we have here we are using an android card image that passes

190
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:21,359
is the content of an image I am not we are last night 3 tomorrow analytics arrives

191
00:14:21,359 --> 00:14:26,850
we see that the ceo is not doing well that h 3 has to be h 2 h 4 when

192
00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:31,230
they are related because it is less important and we start again when this factor

193
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:35,189
I know where this was happening here because we did not improve this and well in another

194
00:14:35,189 --> 00:14:38,850
file we have that inside the crime works another way we have multiple

195
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:43,980
rules for this now doing a little factor we come to this that cart a

196
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:48,120
single file we don't have multiple files for this module

197
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:53,850
it behaves like this has the favors of it the shadow the edge the maximum size

198
00:14:53,850 --> 00:14:57,089
maybe in related it behaves in such a way and then the different

199
00:14:57,089 --> 00:15:01,110
components of drying carrie more cards of the card content this is what I'm going with

200
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:06,650
think modularly it does not matter if we are going to use is max ssv in for

201
00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:10,470
differentiate why the its the modules the modules etc. the important thing is that

202
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:13,850
have a rule and manage to keep it going

203
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:19,490
So with this we know that if afterwards the h2o lh3 h4 or we change it for a

204
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:24,050
paragraph is always going to be consistent sometimes there's still to change some

205
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:27,829
property because 83 and 82 have different margins or pad only sizes

206
00:15:27,829 --> 00:15:30,980
but if we feel that all correctly in tulle letter

207
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:34,459
We are sure that later when the site starts to scale and we look at other

208
00:15:34,459 --> 00:15:37,940
modules elsewhere the module will react the same

209
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:43,370
way something that's always interesting is

210
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:47,510
learn from your own code and you finish writing a project

211
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:51,020
work on css and start doing a little bit of cv you will start doing

212
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:55,410
different browsers or different solutions and you start to

213
00:15:55,410 --> 00:15:59,249
find how look at this I did it this way 8 and putting this property

214
00:15:59,249 --> 00:16:03,899
change how it is done in firefox for example there are multiple 3ds rendering

215
00:16:03,899 --> 00:16:08,459
ss and you have to be careful with everyone and the experience you gain doing this is

216
00:16:08,459 --> 00:16:12,119
just queuing up in our code depending on what things

217
00:16:12,119 --> 00:16:16,559
occur in each of them peer review the gdp is a very good practice for

218
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:20,369
working as a team we learn from each other's code and what solutions they came up with

219
00:16:20,369 --> 00:16:24,660
in other people not always all the solutions are the same and I think it is

220
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:27,959
something very valuable to share with the rest of the team that later in the future

221
00:16:27,959 --> 00:16:31,470
it even causes the code to be maintained in some way because we all

222
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:35,370
We already saw that code and we more or less know what that person is dealing with

223
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:38,580
here we are in the office doing a little care on one of the sites

224
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:43,509
that's we talk about bone dynamism it is possible it is optional you have to walk

225
00:16:43,509 --> 00:16:48,430
in everything yes or yes and stop tablets how it works in touch touch is something is something

226
00:16:48,430 --> 00:16:53,439
that we have before is very different how something interactively works in a

227
00:16:53,439 --> 00:16:56,939
device than a computer

228
00:16:57,379 --> 00:17:04,760
if those are like julia said she has her problems when they walk when they don't

229
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:09,350
but it is also very important that our source code if we have hacks or

230
00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:12,110
things that we learned throughout our development

231
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:16,160
we document them well because in the future it will reach another person who

232
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,030
maybe it's not us who has to keep that place

233
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:23,590
and that person is not going to know why that property is there and maybe they learn something

234
00:17:23,590 --> 00:17:28,330
again and it says look is talking about that in the internet explorer the images

235
00:17:28,330 --> 00:17:32,200
they looked different and with this line I solved it I just

236
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:36,820
learn something new and I think this as developers we are people that all the

237
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:41,140
day is learning new things because as one showed comes there is a

238
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:44,500
development that is being promoted and that every time we implement new

239
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:49,720
technologies to make things more amazing new landings new sites

240
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:54,590
new products all here is let's say pointing to

241
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:59,840
to improve what we show the user experience and make them

242
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:03,679
beautiful obviously not then thank you all so much now if I'm not mistaken

243
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:07,370
well in coffee break we also have questions if I'm not mistaken for a little while

244
00:18:07,370 --> 00:18:11,690
for that I don't know and if I'm not there to have a coffee or a beer what

245
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:15,000
like later so thank you all very much
