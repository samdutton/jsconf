[Music]

5
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:55,949
since this is jazz college I'm guessing

6
00:00:55,949 --> 00:00:57,510
that most of you are JavaScript

7
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:04,690
developers people are talking about how

8
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:16,210
[Music]

9
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:18,010

00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:40,839
[Music]

17
00:02:40,849 --> 00:02:48,109
the web is it's just amazing one more

18
00:02:48,109 --> 00:02:50,970
reason you should stick to JavaScript

19
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:53,790
it's it's just a really really cool stop

20
00:02:53,790 --> 00:03:00,060
talking about this so this is a rock and

21
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:01,349
it rocks pretty hard

22
00:03:01,349 --> 00:03:05,129
in the way that rocks so I'd like to

23
00:03:05,129 --> 00:03:10,049
read your column nobody sits like this

24
00:03:10,049 --> 00:03:14,920

00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:21,550
throughout just sits and is you show us

26
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:27,069
how to just sit here and that's what we

27
00:03:27,069 --> 00:03:27,340
need

28
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:35,699
[Music]

29
00:03:35,709 --> 00:03:39,709
this is too abstract I can't use this

30
00:03:39,709 --> 00:03:43,700
how do I make it make more sense it

31
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:45,470
doesn't make sense you see it doesn't

32
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:46,489
make sense

33
00:03:46,489 --> 00:03:50,660
how do I make it make more sense brains

34
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:55,040
brains I deleted it and brain brains

35
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,250
obviously it does melt your brain spring

36
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:01,610
rains in the open brain brain brain

37
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:03,590
brain and I really do this in the old

38
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:18,210
days can we do stuff

39
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:27,850
[Music]

40
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:36,860
it would just jump beauties around time

41
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:38,400
of application

42
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:42,040
[Music]

43
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:45,350
during the runtime of application

44
00:04:45,350 --> 00:06:00,300
[Music]

45
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:03,090
