00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:13,620

hi there I think thank you for staying

2
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:15,809
this late I'm between you and the

3
00:00:15,809 --> 00:00:19,859
cocktails so I'll try to be quick but

4
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:23,010
interesting at the same time i'm here to

5
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:25,710
talk today about the node foundation how

6
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:29,820
many of you guys are users of known so

7
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:32,340
about half that's pretty good alright

8
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:35,040
and some of this you're going to know

9
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,510
about it there's also a little history

10
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:38,760
lesson in here because i like to remind

11
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:41,700
people of where we came from and you

12
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:43,230
know i've been talking about open source

13
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:47,280
for almost 20 years now and i love it

14
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,649
that we that we won to the extent that

15
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:51,960
we have one but i noticed that if we

16
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,149
don't stay vigilant and keep reminding

17
00:00:54,149 --> 00:00:56,760
people especially new people what's

18
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:59,670
happening we run the risk of losing it

19
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:02,940
again because it's a slippery slope it's

20
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:05,400
really easy to give up you know little

21
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,890
concessions along the way that the you

22
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:10,110
know add up to the end of open source so

23
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:12,560
we'll talk about that a little bit too

24
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:20,720
all right so jun 2014 I was at foo camp

25
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:24,000
which is a conference that Tim O'Reilly

26
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,670
gives it's an invitational conference in

27
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:29,790
his backyard and he literally pitch

28
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:33,360
tents and you know I was kind of minding

29
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,520
my own business in there and this guy

30
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,150
walks up to me this is michael rogers

31
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:42,899
and he has been caring about JavaScript

32
00:01:42,899 --> 00:01:45,780
and and also know Jas for quite a long

33
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:48,990
time now and he wanted to understand

34
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:52,140
about copyright because there had just

35
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:54,780
been a change in the node community the

36
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:57,149
trademark holder of node had

37
00:01:57,149 --> 00:02:00,719
unilaterally decided to stop aggregating

38
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:03,240
copyright that means you didn't have to

39
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,740
sign the little piece of paper anymore

40
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:07,770
to give a contribution and he wanted to

41
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:09,750
understand what the effect of that was

42
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:12,060
going to be and exactly what was going

43
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:12,700
to happen

44
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:17,590
next and as it happened I did know a

45
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:19,629
little bit about node and the reason

46
00:02:19,629 --> 00:02:21,310
that I knew about note at all was

47
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:23,019
because I had gone to work a few months

48
00:02:23,019 --> 00:02:28,480
earlier for paypal so paypal switched to

49
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:34,200
node in 2013 and they did this in a very

50
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:37,319
calculated way some of you may have seen

51
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:40,930
this gentleman talking about the switch

52
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:42,849
because he was kind of the architect of

53
00:02:42,849 --> 00:02:45,400
it this is bill Scott he came from

54
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:48,459
netflix to paypal with the goal of

55
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:51,190
changing the way that paypal front ended

56
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:54,069
and he wanted to use this tool this tool

57
00:02:54,069 --> 00:02:58,329
node and at the time at 2013 paypal was

58
00:02:58,329 --> 00:03:01,780
still front ending in java and he's from

59
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:04,480
texas he's a really sweet guy and when

60
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,940
the people at PayPal that were nervous

61
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:10,510
about change asked him you know what he

62
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:14,200
was doing he said I'm just prototype in

63
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:17,109
you don't have to worry I'm just proud

64
00:03:17,109 --> 00:03:20,319
to type in and he knew that eventually

65
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:21,970
this was going to end up being

66
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:24,010
production code but he also knew that

67
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:26,440
they weren't ready to hear it yet he

68
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,450
waited until the Java developers were

69
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:31,060
begging to be allowed to use node

70
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:34,510
because two people very small team were

71
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:37,450
able to get more done than like our team

72
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:40,049
of 25 people trying to front end in Java

73
00:03:40,049 --> 00:03:42,609
and they were losing the race so they

74
00:03:42,609 --> 00:03:45,370
wanted to switch to the other side so

75
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:48,160
anyway this is why I knew about it he

76
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:50,350
called me up and said I would like you

77
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:54,569
to talk to us about how to make our

78
00:03:54,569 --> 00:03:57,150
contribution to the open source world

79
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:59,940
around node really successful and that

80
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:02,470
was the first you're going to do this

81
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:04,870
for me what are you doing oh that's

82
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:10,890
terrible Apple all right

83
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:16,130
so in 2014 we will they released Kraken

84
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:19,190
the beginning of the year I had helped

85
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:22,070
them with all the details of it to make

86
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:26,120
it have the best possible landing and I

87
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:28,430
did this as a consultant and lo and

88
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:31,490
behold it was really successful and they

89
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:32,930
listen to me carefully and they did

90
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:35,810
everything I told them to do so then

91
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:38,210
they said you should be an employee and

92
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:41,330
I said well why would I do that I'm a

93
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:44,479
consultant I like my life and they they

94
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:46,430
basically made it so I couldn't say no

95
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:48,169
one of the things they did was they let

96
00:04:48,169 --> 00:04:50,840
me keep my consultancy open so I have a

97
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,610
lot of interesting conversations with

98
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:57,440
people but back then when they released

99
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,900
Kraken which is a framework that sits on

100
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:03,130
top of express and mix node run at

101
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:07,310
PayPal scale which is lots and lots of

102
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:09,020
transactions especially at Christmas

103
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:13,250
time and it's kind of a bumper area so

104
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:15,139
that our developers have a lot of choice

105
00:05:15,139 --> 00:05:17,090
they can pick whatever modules they

106
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:19,220
think they want to use but they can't

107
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:20,720
get in too much trouble because this

108
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,120
framework is keeping making sure that

109
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:27,560
they can run at scale this is a these

110
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,570
are the companies that were using node

111
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:32,630
in everyday work in 2014 when we

112
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:34,700
released crackin and this is from an

113
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:37,070
article that Joyent who's the trademark

114
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:40,220
holder was what you know put out and it

115
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:42,110
was impressive list I was really

116
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:45,590
surprised Wow all right we'll just keep

117
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:47,330
doing this periodically until it goes

118
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:50,449
away but also they had a passionate

119
00:05:50,449 --> 00:05:54,229
ecosystem I noticed I noticed that

120
00:05:54,229 --> 00:05:57,070
because somebody started a campaign of

121
00:05:57,070 --> 00:05:59,840
people from the ecosystem introducing

122
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,780
themselves to me as I was joining paypal

123
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:04,520
because they were hoping that we would

124
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:06,139
do more for node that we would be more

125
00:06:06,139 --> 00:06:08,000
interested in no time we we you know

126
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,460
keep lifting it Michael had already

127
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:11,960
explained to me that there was a problem

128
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:15,949
and so you know I knew that something

129
00:06:15,949 --> 00:06:17,630
was coming so I started a conversation

130
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:21,200
with this guy this is a his knee

131
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:26,330
um Stewart Hammond sorry it's because

132
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:28,160
the network is out so it won't let me

133
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,840
actually quit out of that piece of

134
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:35,360
software do what ignore thank you I did

135
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,180
try that once before just so you know so

136
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:41,990
um this is the guy Scott Hammond who is

137
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:45,170
the CEO of giant who owned the trademark

138
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:47,960
for node and who had made the he's not

139
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:50,300
the one who made the decision but I

140
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:52,790
started talking to him because he's the

141
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:54,740
one who would have to make a decision if

142
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:56,240
something was going to change for node

143
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,730
and I spent a lot of time talking to him

144
00:06:58,730 --> 00:07:01,580
and I want to say he's and he's a smart

145
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:03,680
man he's very interested in getting it

146
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:07,460
right he's passionate about doing the

147
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:10,100
right things for the technology but also

148
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:13,070
getting some credit for what he thinks

149
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:15,170
was reasonable stewardship even though

150
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:17,750
he wasn't there he's a brand new CEO but

151
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:20,330
he likes the idea that his company looks

152
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:22,850
you know does well in addition to know

153
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:25,340
doing well and I wanted to help him out

154
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:29,630
I really did so over time we we we got

155
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:32,750
there but I gotta say that it's really

156
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:35,180
hard to learn open source if you're from

157
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:37,940
a proprietary point of view he's had

158
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:40,400
various things that he didn't understand

159
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,320
over the time that that we've been

160
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,390
talking and he gets through them and

161
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:45,950
then and then another one comes up and

162
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:48,020
it's really interesting because it remit

163
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:51,140
mirrors my consulting world when I had

164
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:56,430
to explain it to clients so for instance

165
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:59,870
one day he was very upset because one of

166
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:02,900
the major vendors in the node space was

167
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:05,090
wrapping the open source code was the

168
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:08,090
proprietary code and in putting it out

169
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:09,530
as a product and he didn't think that

170
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:11,000
that should be possible because it was

171
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,310
open source and I said permissive

172
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:15,650
licensing dude that's the name of the

173
00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:17,960
game that's what you want you want that

174
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:21,050
adoption he's like really why do I want

175
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:24,170
this you know endless problems like that

176
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:26,420
and the main one was and it took me a

177
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:29,930
long time to realize his focus is on end

178
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:33,530
users not on the developers that are

179
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:34,080
create

180
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,450
the software because in his business

181
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:39,450
life he has to focus on the end user and

182
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:41,280
he thinks of the developers his

183
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:44,760
employees as cogs in a wheel like a lot

184
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:47,130
of employers but of course open source

185
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:50,040
turns out on its head those those core

186
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:52,530
developers are the whole deal they're

187
00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:55,560
everything and the users it's nice if

188
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,450
the users can use the software but it's

189
00:08:57,450 --> 00:08:59,520
really about those core developers so

190
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:02,790
this was a little different for him but

191
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:05,460
we we slide through it now we're going

192
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:09,240
to have time out first story so remember

193
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,740
that I talked that i was talking to

194
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:12,900
Scott Hammond we're going to talk about

195
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:14,580
a completely different thing that

196
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:20,100
happened 12 years earlier okay so once

197
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:22,380
upon a time there was this technology

198
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:24,960
called Java you guys all know Java how

199
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:27,780
many of you have coded in java yeah okay

200
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:32,790
good so Java was not open source java

201
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:35,730
had not been open source ever and it was

202
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:40,290
problematic until this guy made a

203
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:44,100
statement at a conference in Tokyo he

204
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:48,060
said the Java would be open source the

205
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:52,950
next year and then he quit I don't want

206
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:54,840
to comment on mr. Barrett's and why he

207
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:57,210
would do that but shortly after that I

208
00:09:57,210 --> 00:09:59,430
got tapped on the shoulder and a sushi

209
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:02,100
bar in cupertino across from Apple's

210
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:04,530
headquarters and asked if I wanted to

211
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:08,580
open source java and i called my husband

212
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:11,070
up like i do and i said do i want to

213
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:14,460
open source java he said yes you do yes

214
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:17,040
you want to do that and i said why do I

215
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,360
want to do that he said cuz you're

216
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:21,600
really stubborn and you probably get it

217
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:25,230
right eventually alright so when mr.

218
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:27,710
Barrett's left there was a power vacuum

219
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:30,990
this is a dyson vacuum but that the what

220
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:32,880
I'm talking about is there was no

221
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,940
leadership in the company and the people

222
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:38,990
who invested in Java were really upset

223
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:44,040
so I you may know that for the ten first

224
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:46,560
years of Java the biggest companies in

225
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,820
the valley all gave

226
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:50,640
million dollars apiece every year so

227
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,710
that Java would be developed son figured

228
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:54,240
out that they could create partnerships

229
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,250
with all these companies because

230
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:58,410
everybody wanted this thing the idea of

231
00:10:58,410 --> 00:11:01,740
write once run anywhere was really

232
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:03,750
compelling so everybody wanted a piece

233
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:07,520
of that so they could they showed up

234
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:10,770
though they are the people who'd been

235
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:14,400
paying money in and they said son you

236
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,020
don't have your act together you need to

237
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:17,580
give us this technology we've been

238
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:20,340
paying for all this time I mean give it

239
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:22,710
to us we shouldn't be running this

240
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:25,800
anymore you're bad stewards right and

241
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,630
this was some of the biggest companies

242
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:29,010
you could their household names you know

243
00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:31,830
most of them and you know what to do

244
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:35,100
what to do right well this guy and this

245
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:36,980
is the best picture I could find of him

246
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:40,350
this is John canna guard and he is the

247
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:44,220
unsung hero of open source java he's the

248
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:46,350
one who was running java soft the

249
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:51,720
division he said you know what it's true

250
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:54,660
that we have a power vacuum and it's

251
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:56,640
true that they've been putting money in

252
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:59,520
but they're the wrong people to run java

253
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:01,590
going forward java should be run by

254
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:03,600
everybody who has a stake in the game

255
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:07,320
and so really what was happening was he

256
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:10,110
kind of put on his his colored glasses

257
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:12,570
his rose-colored glasses and he came up

258
00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:14,760
with this idea of this sort of commune

259
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,440
that they were going to start around

260
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,150
java and it was going to be called the

261
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:21,330
java community process now he's the one

262
00:12:21,330 --> 00:12:25,200
who had pushed Tomcat so tom cat came

263
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:29,430
from a very senior person who you know

264
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:32,310
saw the opportunity and put money

265
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:34,440
together to build a team to create

266
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:37,440
Tomcat which was the servlet api put

267
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,350
into open source out of java and they

268
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:41,970
did it because microsoft was get

269
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:44,790
otherwise on the web and they needed to

270
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:46,620
drive adoption and this was the fastest

271
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:48,480
way to drive adoption for an alternative

272
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:51,360
so that's why we have tomcat so he was

273
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,980
kind of a visionary about open source

274
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:56,280
from the beginning and then we started

275
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:58,530
the java community process he asked me

276
00:12:58,530 --> 00:13:01,200
to get Apache involved

277
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,170
and I did that I've been an Apache

278
00:13:04,170 --> 00:13:06,750
member for a long time I told them you

279
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:09,300
know this is it this is an opportunity

280
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:12,030
because you guys care about Java I don't

281
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:13,650
know how much of a hassle it's going to

282
00:13:13,650 --> 00:13:15,810
be I'll just warn you you're going to be

283
00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:17,460
the only ones that are really pushing

284
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:20,100
for open source but you know canna guard

285
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:22,350
wants this to happen and they said okay

286
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:27,180
we'll do it so so then and here we are

287
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:30,170
again all right you think that if I do

288
00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:34,680
what I can't do that and I can't do that

289
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:43,470
either apparently Apple I don't know

290
00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:45,450
what to do with this now I think we're

291
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:47,070
gonna have to escape out of it and try

292
00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:51,210
do this all right I think that's really

293
00:13:51,210 --> 00:13:52,710
still not going to work but we'll try it

294
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:56,310
all right so they were they were happy

295
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:58,470
together tom cat was doing really well

296
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:02,910
and then it came time to renegotiate the

297
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:05,760
document that bound all of the members

298
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,490
of the java community together and this

299
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:11,610
includes IBM and oracle and motorola and

300
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:14,640
apple and God and everybody Microsoft

301
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:17,400
even everybody's in there right they

302
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,870
wanted to renegotiate it because there

303
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:20,880
were some bugs in the process they found

304
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,790
and so they're doing this and the guy

305
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:28,470
from Apache and the guy from Apache is

306
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:30,390
caught is sitting through these long

307
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:33,570
calls every week two hours of his time

308
00:14:33,570 --> 00:14:35,910
three hours of his time and he's a

309
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:38,190
volunteer but he's in there he's working

310
00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:41,810
hard to get that done and one time he

311
00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:46,470
asks the lawyer on a call would it be

312
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:49,410
possible to do tom cat under this new

313
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:51,630
agreement because that was what was

314
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:53,610
happening at Apache all they cared about

315
00:14:53,610 --> 00:14:55,260
was you know are we going to be in

316
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:57,590
violation of this future agreement and

317
00:14:57,590 --> 00:15:01,380
the answer was tom cat wouldn't be

318
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:04,290
possible even son could not do open

319
00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:06,330
source java under the agreement that

320
00:15:06,330 --> 00:15:10,160
they were writing and you know apache

321
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:13,689
they got mad

322
00:15:13,699 --> 00:15:17,759
they got really mad like 200 200 very

323
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:19,560
influential engineers the members of

324
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:22,170
Apache were saying well we can't stay in

325
00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:25,199
this organization because it's not going

326
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:26,519
to be open source anymore and that's

327
00:15:26,519 --> 00:15:29,279
what we're here for so they announced

328
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:32,970
that they were going to leave and now

329
00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:36,240
that could not happen so they negotiated

330
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:39,089
a compromise and these guys are the ones

331
00:15:39,089 --> 00:15:41,399
who did it the one on this side is Rob

332
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:45,360
jingle he was the CTO of Java soft and

333
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:48,209
the one on this side is Jason hunter and

334
00:15:48,209 --> 00:15:51,779
he actually lives in singapore now so I

335
00:15:51,779 --> 00:15:53,189
had dinner with him a couple nights ago

336
00:15:53,189 --> 00:15:55,620
but he's the one who was on the phone

337
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:57,689
for these long long calls and they

338
00:15:57,689 --> 00:15:59,250
negotiated something that they called

339
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:01,920
the Apache compromise it basically said

340
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:05,069
that Apache should be allowed because

341
00:16:05,069 --> 00:16:06,810
they're good guys and they care about

342
00:16:06,810 --> 00:16:08,790
compatibility and they have the right

343
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:11,129
goals for java they're not trying to

344
00:16:11,129 --> 00:16:13,290
break it they should be allowed to

345
00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:16,649
reimplement the java specs in open

346
00:16:16,649 --> 00:16:18,569
source as long as they do it compatibly

347
00:16:18,569 --> 00:16:23,069
this was a huge piece of news in 2003

348
00:16:23,069 --> 00:16:26,459
because I had been working since 1999 to

349
00:16:26,459 --> 00:16:29,100
try to open source java and mostly i got

350
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:31,589
this from the people that wrote java so

351
00:16:31,589 --> 00:16:34,259
this was a really big change so then I

352
00:16:34,259 --> 00:16:37,829
convinced Rob that it needed to be

353
00:16:37,829 --> 00:16:39,870
something that was publicly known

354
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:42,720
because transparency open source and

355
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,060
Java one was what was going to happen

356
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:48,689
like the next week so could we just walk

357
00:16:48,689 --> 00:16:51,300
on stage and have a conversation maybe

358
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:54,060
between keynotes because rob was going

359
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:56,339
to be the emcee of java one that year

360
00:16:56,339 --> 00:17:01,170
and so there was no way to get a real

361
00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:03,360
announcement out because PR it takes

362
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,549
months to do those announcements but

363
00:17:05,549 --> 00:17:07,860
also they didn't like the idea of this

364
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:10,589
they were part of this you know they

365
00:17:10,589 --> 00:17:12,750
didn't want to see java open sourced and

366
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:16,049
so but they didn't want to fire me

367
00:17:16,049 --> 00:17:17,669
either they just could have left me

368
00:17:17,669 --> 00:17:20,490
around so now you have to think about

369
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:23,730
this six in the morning we're walking

370
00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:27,720
across Howard Street to go in

371
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:30,330
do the rehearsal for the keynote this is

372
00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:32,820
Jason and me now it's really early in

373
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:34,350
the morning for Jason he's a programmer

374
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:36,390
how many of you like to get up at six in

375
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:38,700
the morning yeah like almost nobody

376
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:42,480
right so he's grumpy and we're walking

377
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,640
across the street across the zebra

378
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,669
crossing and we run and see I told you

379
00:17:47,669 --> 00:17:53,400
it was going to do it sorry well I made

380
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:57,900
it go away though okay and so we run

381
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:00,840
into this lady she was in charge of

382
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:04,140
brand her name was Tracy stout and she

383
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:05,700
and I are walking across the crosswalk

384
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:08,010
and she says what are you doing here

385
00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:11,130
Denise and I said oh I have my friend

386
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:12,960
Jason hunter he's going to be on stage

387
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,700
really briefly between two of the

388
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:17,190
keynotes he's from Apache he's going to

389
00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:19,620
talk about open source java and she says

390
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:22,559
that's nice and then we get down down

391
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:25,970
the stairs she goes into the green room

392
00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:29,580
where scott mcnealy who has a keynote

393
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:32,340
that day is not happy with his speech

394
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:35,309
and you see how in this picture scott is

395
00:18:35,309 --> 00:18:37,890
holding select a little stack of cards

396
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:40,470
that's how he did his keynotes they were

397
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:42,840
written out very very specifically and

398
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:45,000
then he'd rip went off and throw it over

399
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,440
his shoulder sometimes in the middle of

400
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:48,870
the keynote you know right so he's

401
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:51,059
backstage he doesn't like his talk and

402
00:18:51,059 --> 00:18:54,120
he is throwing cards and he's yelling

403
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:58,440
and everybody's terrified and Tracy

404
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:01,200
comes in and she says he basically he's

405
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,580
upset because he doesn't think there's

406
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:05,309
anything newsworthy in his keynote he

407
00:19:05,309 --> 00:19:07,860
says I'm the CEO there should be

408
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:10,230
something interesting in this talk why

409
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:11,880
can't I get something interesting to say

410
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:15,450
and Tracy says I just ran into Denise in

411
00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:17,400
the crosswalk and she's got this guy

412
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:20,669
from Apache and open source java and he

413
00:19:20,669 --> 00:19:25,169
says bring me that kid ok so we're in

414
00:19:25,169 --> 00:19:28,020
the front of the house jason has his

415
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:30,390
microphone on we're standing there and

416
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:33,179
he's all gaga because because james

417
00:19:33,179 --> 00:19:34,770
gosling is standing there and he's

418
00:19:34,770 --> 00:19:37,080
talking to him there's nobody there in

419
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:39,870
the in the audience at all it's six in

420
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:40,169
the more

421
00:19:40,169 --> 00:19:48,179
right and so Scott Scott gets a hold of

422
00:19:48,179 --> 00:19:51,149
jason and the next thing I know Jason is

423
00:19:51,149 --> 00:19:54,389
the featured event at Scott's keynote

424
00:19:54,389 --> 00:19:56,700
and they stand on stage and they talk

425
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:59,999
about open source java in front of not

426
00:19:59,999 --> 00:20:02,340
only the 28,000 people that are

427
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:04,409
physically in the room because they're

428
00:20:04,409 --> 00:20:06,119
literally are that many people that fit

429
00:20:06,119 --> 00:20:08,730
in moscone but also the millions of

430
00:20:08,730 --> 00:20:10,049
people that are watching this stream

431
00:20:10,049 --> 00:20:11,970
this is the moment that it really

432
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:13,919
happened that we knew there would be

433
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:16,259
open Java but it took all of those

434
00:20:16,259 --> 00:20:19,609
coincidences and all of that sort of

435
00:20:19,609 --> 00:20:24,600
clandestine belief to make it happen so

436
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,279
is happy news for everybody that was

437
00:20:26,279 --> 00:20:28,649
there by the way I really really hard

438
00:20:28,649 --> 00:20:30,269
time finding a good picture of the

439
00:20:30,269 --> 00:20:33,330
inside of moscone I will say it was not

440
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:36,359
happy news for everyone so you see how

441
00:20:36,359 --> 00:20:37,769
you're sitting in the front row here

442
00:20:37,769 --> 00:20:39,989
that's what happens when you are

443
00:20:39,989 --> 00:20:43,019
babysitting a keynote at javaone they

444
00:20:43,019 --> 00:20:45,749
make you sit in the front row and behind

445
00:20:45,749 --> 00:20:48,960
you are all the people that work at Sun

446
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:52,289
and I mean every VP every director and

447
00:20:52,289 --> 00:20:55,139
they're all angry because we got this

448
00:20:55,139 --> 00:20:58,350
news out the door without any approval

449
00:20:58,350 --> 00:21:01,559
any PR any anything and of course as

450
00:21:01,559 --> 00:21:03,960
soon as the keynotes over every reporter

451
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:06,899
wants to know they're all really

452
00:21:06,899 --> 00:21:09,989
interested in this big change so what

453
00:21:09,989 --> 00:21:11,700
was the story what was this story about

454
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:14,519
this is how much work it was it used to

455
00:21:14,519 --> 00:21:17,730
be to open source stuff it was really

456
00:21:17,730 --> 00:21:20,669
hard and it took it took like acts of

457
00:21:20,669 --> 00:21:23,190
God to get these companies to give up

458
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:26,190
their IP these days everybody gets it I

459
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:29,129
mean node is worth not quite as much as

460
00:21:29,129 --> 00:21:31,710
Java but it's getting it the momentum of

461
00:21:31,710 --> 00:21:35,279
how fast note is becoming the way you do

462
00:21:35,279 --> 00:21:37,320
a front end and even the way you do sort

463
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:38,759
of the middleware and parts of the back

464
00:21:38,759 --> 00:21:41,519
end it's amazing how fast it's happening

465
00:21:41,519 --> 00:21:43,980
and and a lot of that is being driven by

466
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:46,259
the fact that it's open source you know

467
00:21:46,259 --> 00:21:49,080
son spent an incredible amounts of money

468
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:52,109
getting every single kid in the cs

469
00:21:52,109 --> 00:21:53,400
departments of the world

470
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:56,700
to learn java and and i don't know that

471
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:58,170
they're teaching note i think they're

472
00:21:58,170 --> 00:22:00,780
still teaching java because they're sort

473
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:02,700
of stuck in the old way of doing things

474
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:05,340
but note is available for everybody to

475
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:08,100
use and learn and it really is becoming

476
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:13,110
the the tool of choice so i just say the

477
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:16,050
rest is history meanwhile now we're

478
00:22:16,050 --> 00:22:17,430
going to come back through the present

479
00:22:17,430 --> 00:22:21,810
back at node we set up an advisory board

480
00:22:21,810 --> 00:22:23,910
as soon as God Hammond was comfortable

481
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:26,070
enough to do that and it was all the

482
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:28,230
stakeholders that were agitating for

483
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:30,750
change including some really really big

484
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:34,470
companies and we met publicly we met

485
00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:37,740
every month we you know slowly but

486
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:39,360
surely we're starting to talk about what

487
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:42,660
should happen not everybody loves

488
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:45,480
process however and a lot of the key

489
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:47,610
engineers that were working on note in

490
00:22:47,610 --> 00:22:50,130
the technical committee got really bored

491
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:53,280
and they ended up famously creating a

492
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:57,120
community fork I ojs and this turned out

493
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,310
to be a really valuable thing that they

494
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:01,680
did so when they spend a lot of energy

495
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:04,620
and how they wanted to work together in

496
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:07,010
the future how things needed to change

497
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:09,660
for them to feel comfortable and they

498
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:12,740
documented that stuff really well

499
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:15,000
Michael Rogers who you saw the picture

500
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,740
of earlier was kind of in the middle of

501
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:18,930
making sure that documentation was clean

502
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:22,080
and reasonable and there were good you

503
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,000
know well thought out plans for how

504
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,440
things were going to change and move

505
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:28,350
forward totally valuable work and

506
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:31,080
honestly no foundation wouldn't exist

507
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:36,960
without that work today so we got them

508
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,610
started talking to the linux foundation

509
00:23:38,610 --> 00:23:41,550
that turned out to be the best partner

510
00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:45,990
for scott for giant because they really

511
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:49,470
talked in business terms a lot of their

512
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:51,630
thrust is about is about earning money

513
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:53,700
for the technology so that it can go

514
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:57,150
forward and so that's why we went with

515
00:23:57,150 --> 00:24:00,870
them we had a panel at node summit where

516
00:24:00,870 --> 00:24:02,820
we first talked about the likelihood

517
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:04,710
that this was going to happen really for

518
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:08,790
real in june and the guy on the on this

519
00:24:08,790 --> 00:24:10,830
side here that's Jim's Emlyn who runs

520
00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:13,050
the linux foundation so that was a group

521
00:24:13,050 --> 00:24:16,620
of interested parties including yes God

522
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:18,690
Hammond is in the middle there talking

523
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:20,340
about the desire to create a foundation

524
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:23,760
and the hope that I ojs would come back

525
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:26,550
into the fold now there haven't been

526
00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:29,280
that many Forks that have healed in the

527
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:31,260
history of open-source just a handful

528
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:34,950
maybe like less than five total and the

529
00:24:34,950 --> 00:24:36,780
biggest one was pearl and that was

530
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:39,990
almost 25 30 years ago now so I was

531
00:24:39,990 --> 00:24:42,150
really excited to be involved on in

532
00:24:42,150 --> 00:24:45,300
fixing this one and eventually we got

533
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:48,510
chartered yes in August and that was a

534
00:24:48,510 --> 00:24:51,390
really really big deal I ojs said that

535
00:24:51,390 --> 00:24:53,550
they would come back if we if we did it

536
00:24:53,550 --> 00:24:56,100
properly this is where we are now with

537
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:58,050
sponsoring members it's a lot of big

538
00:24:58,050 --> 00:24:59,640
companies and a lot of small companies

539
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:02,250
that are involved in the node community

540
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:06,270
and this is a pay-to-play board that

541
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:08,160
means all these people are paying money

542
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:11,250
to have a seat somewhere on the table

543
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:15,840
that to me is a bug in open source I

544
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,610
honestly think that pay to play is the

545
00:25:17,610 --> 00:25:20,750
wrong way to go because think about it

546
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:24,990
open source is people I am involved in

547
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:29,490
node but because I have a seat that was

548
00:25:29,490 --> 00:25:32,880
paid for by my company if I were to

549
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:36,150
leave paypal i would also be walking

550
00:25:36,150 --> 00:25:39,150
away from that seed and that's not how

551
00:25:39,150 --> 00:25:41,070
open source works open source is about

552
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:42,840
people becoming passionate about

553
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:45,120
technology and sticking it out

554
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:48,120
regardless of where they sit you know

555
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:51,090
when i left son i was sitting on the OSI

556
00:25:51,090 --> 00:25:52,710
board the Open Source Initiative board

557
00:25:52,710 --> 00:25:56,190
and we had just changed presidents went

558
00:25:56,190 --> 00:25:58,230
from the guy who had done it for a long

559
00:25:58,230 --> 00:26:00,630
time you guys probably know eric raymond

560
00:26:00,630 --> 00:26:04,080
to michael teman who worked for red hat

561
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,630
and i got a memo from jonathan schwartz

562
00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:09,750
that said I'm uncomfortable with red hat

563
00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:12,390
holding this seat why didn't you take it

564
00:26:12,390 --> 00:26:16,260
now I had given notice his son I was

565
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:18,250
just working out my you know

566
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:20,740
the weeks until I changed and went off

567
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:23,590
to work for Intel and so I wrote back to

568
00:26:23,590 --> 00:26:25,350
him I said well first of all Jonathan

569
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:27,850
you don't really have a seat on the

570
00:26:27,850 --> 00:26:29,830
board I have a seat on the board I

571
00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:32,560
happen to work for you but I actually

572
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:35,170
gave notice you know three weeks ago and

573
00:26:35,170 --> 00:26:39,100
don't they tell you anything and and I'm

574
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:41,260
not going to be here much longer and

575
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:43,270
then some won't have any representatives

576
00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:45,970
on OSI board because I'm going to go

577
00:26:45,970 --> 00:26:47,860
work for Intel so then Intel will have

578
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:50,080
one you know so trying to explain to him

579
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:52,420
how that goes they're used to pay to

580
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:55,000
play they're used to a different kind of

581
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,950
arrangement and they're not they think

582
00:26:56,950 --> 00:26:58,960
of resources and when I say they I mean

583
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:01,780
corporations think of resources as

584
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:04,030
fungible so remember i talked about how

585
00:27:04,030 --> 00:27:06,850
Scott was thinking about the users but

586
00:27:06,850 --> 00:27:10,240
not the engineers even a even a company

587
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,460
like son that's totally organized around

588
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:14,890
engineering still thinks of the

589
00:27:14,890 --> 00:27:17,560
engineers as kind of cogs in a big

590
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:20,380
machine you know and we can tell you

591
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:21,910
where to work and we can tell you where

592
00:27:21,910 --> 00:27:24,160
to work after that we can put you on an

593
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:26,290
open source project and get you all spun

594
00:27:26,290 --> 00:27:28,210
up and then decide that it's not a good

595
00:27:28,210 --> 00:27:30,010
investment and pull you off of it and

596
00:27:30,010 --> 00:27:33,880
you should leave gracefully that's not

597
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:37,210
open source open source is like hell I'm

598
00:27:37,210 --> 00:27:39,430
gonna leave I've got stuff to do here

599
00:27:39,430 --> 00:27:42,490
I'm interested in this project you know

600
00:27:42,490 --> 00:27:45,850
that's that's open source and and I'm

601
00:27:45,850 --> 00:27:47,470
taking my seat with me when I leave

602
00:27:47,470 --> 00:27:49,840
because I'm the one doing the work not

603
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:53,080
you so I think it's important that we

604
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:55,270
remember that if you work for a company

605
00:27:55,270 --> 00:27:57,070
that allows you to work on an open

606
00:27:57,070 --> 00:27:59,800
source and they expect to be able to

607
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:02,260
tell you when to stop you might want to

608
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:05,080
find another company do really good work

609
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:06,880
on that project you it shouldn't be too

610
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:14,320
hard okay come on Oh again again all

611
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:17,920
right there we go so node has a

612
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:20,260
technical steering committee the board

613
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:22,360
does not tell them what to do the

614
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:24,340
technical decisions are handled by the

615
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:26,350
steering committee this is in the bylaws

616
00:28:26,350 --> 00:28:29,710
this is a condition of I ojs coming back

617
00:28:29,710 --> 00:28:31,929
and it's the way open source

618
00:28:31,929 --> 00:28:33,789
should be run because they're in it

619
00:28:33,789 --> 00:28:36,360
because they care not because they paid

620
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:39,039
so this is one modification that we're

621
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:41,409
making to try to get to better open

622
00:28:41,409 --> 00:28:43,629
source behavior their mission is really

623
00:28:43,629 --> 00:28:47,259
good mission they exist as a board as a

624
00:28:47,259 --> 00:28:50,350
foundation to promote through open

625
00:28:50,350 --> 00:28:53,860
development in transparency the

626
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:56,230
furthering of nodejs that is our that is

627
00:28:56,230 --> 00:29:00,059
our mission it's pretty straightforward

628
00:29:00,059 --> 00:29:02,950
we have some working agreements like the

629
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:04,389
one I mentioned before where the

630
00:29:04,389 --> 00:29:06,100
technical steering committee does not

631
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:09,759
get interference from from the board the

632
00:29:09,759 --> 00:29:12,460
board works on fiduciary things like is

633
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:16,299
the trademark being serviced is there

634
00:29:16,299 --> 00:29:19,779
enough money can we do is or do we need

635
00:29:19,779 --> 00:29:21,789
something in the community like this sum

636
00:29:21,789 --> 00:29:23,619
is there some missing thing that

637
00:29:23,619 --> 00:29:25,720
nobody's picking up should we fund that

638
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:28,779
those kinds of things but we do not tell

639
00:29:28,779 --> 00:29:32,499
them what to do the community is rich

640
00:29:32,499 --> 00:29:35,830
they're really really enthusiastic there

641
00:29:35,830 --> 00:29:38,769
they're very diverse extremely diverse

642
00:29:38,769 --> 00:29:40,840
one of the big things is it's not

643
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:42,909
although it's a North American

644
00:29:42,909 --> 00:29:45,669
Foundation it's not a North American

645
00:29:45,669 --> 00:29:48,159
project it's a global project which is

646
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:50,769
what I'm doing here and why I will be

647
00:29:50,769 --> 00:29:52,960
doing a lot of node conferences in the

648
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,639
next year around the world because it's

649
00:29:54,639 --> 00:29:56,169
really important to get the message out

650
00:29:56,169 --> 00:29:59,350
we really are trying to not make it a

651
00:29:59,350 --> 00:30:04,059
North American thing we're hoping to

652
00:30:04,059 --> 00:30:06,429
create an effective umbrella in the same

653
00:30:06,429 --> 00:30:08,440
way that Apache is an umbrella for

654
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:11,950
projects we're working now on specifying

655
00:30:11,950 --> 00:30:15,999
exactly what our umbrella attracts like

656
00:30:15,999 --> 00:30:18,100
we don't want every project in the world

657
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:20,590
but we do have some key projects that we

658
00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:23,139
think need a better home that we depend

659
00:30:23,139 --> 00:30:26,379
on and the first one that we're probably

660
00:30:26,379 --> 00:30:30,789
going to look at is Libby V because we

661
00:30:30,789 --> 00:30:35,320
need it for note for I ojs node and it's

662
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:37,299
down to to maintain errs they're looking

663
00:30:37,299 --> 00:30:40,029
for a home so that's probably the first

664
00:30:40,029 --> 00:30:41,679
one I really really like their logo too

665
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:43,899
isn't it great but we don't know for

666
00:30:43,899 --> 00:30:44,659
sure the

667
00:30:44,659 --> 00:30:46,970
this is I'm letting you in on a future

668
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:49,009
possibility but it's not actually a done

669
00:30:49,009 --> 00:30:52,639
deal yet we are funding a user

670
00:30:52,639 --> 00:30:55,789
conference next month and the idea of

671
00:30:55,789 --> 00:31:00,200
this conference is to create an

672
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:02,570
environment where you could bring people

673
00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:04,429
who are making a decision about whether

674
00:31:04,429 --> 00:31:07,399
to use node so right now if you go to a

675
00:31:07,399 --> 00:31:09,799
node conf what you're going to meet is

676
00:31:09,799 --> 00:31:13,099
the crazy community the wacky community

677
00:31:13,099 --> 00:31:15,999
and and they're very committed and and

678
00:31:15,999 --> 00:31:19,369
lovely and they don't necessarily sell

679
00:31:19,369 --> 00:31:23,929
well to future customers you know hi I'm

680
00:31:23,929 --> 00:31:27,619
from Colonel Sanders okay I'm from

681
00:31:27,619 --> 00:31:29,299
Kentucky Fried Chicken I need to know

682
00:31:29,299 --> 00:31:31,070
about this node thing why does that

683
00:31:31,070 --> 00:31:33,019
person have a dress on isn't that a boy

684
00:31:33,019 --> 00:31:36,739
you know doesn't work so we're trying to

685
00:31:36,739 --> 00:31:39,109
make it clear that there's a technical

686
00:31:39,109 --> 00:31:41,509
community and they need to meet and they

687
00:31:41,509 --> 00:31:43,220
need to meet around the world but

688
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:46,489
there's also the potential user

689
00:31:46,489 --> 00:31:48,679
community if this ecosystem is going to

690
00:31:48,679 --> 00:31:50,720
grow there needs to be good places for

691
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,970
people to come in in a businesslike way

692
00:31:52,970 --> 00:31:55,429
feel comfortable about the promise of

693
00:31:55,429 --> 00:31:57,669
node so that's what this conference is

694
00:31:57,669 --> 00:32:00,859
so we're calling for people that are

695
00:32:00,859 --> 00:32:02,690
interested in node that want to see the

696
00:32:02,690 --> 00:32:04,429
future of node and maybe want to see

697
00:32:04,429 --> 00:32:07,999
their career grow in the node way to

698
00:32:07,999 --> 00:32:09,499
consider getting involved with the

699
00:32:09,499 --> 00:32:12,259
foundation what another change that

700
00:32:12,259 --> 00:32:14,960
we've made to the sort of standard Linux

701
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:18,559
Foundation foundation thing is we have

702
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:23,239
added to community elected seats that

703
00:32:23,239 --> 00:32:25,549
will be from the community at large so

704
00:32:25,549 --> 00:32:27,590
you don't have to pay to get one of

705
00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:30,499
these seats you do have to be elected by

706
00:32:30,499 --> 00:32:33,679
the members by your peers and anyone can

707
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:36,379
become a member of the node foundation

708
00:32:36,379 --> 00:32:38,720
if you are committed you can do that for

709
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:41,599
free if you are not a committer but you

710
00:32:41,599 --> 00:32:43,369
just really interested you can do it for

711
00:32:43,369 --> 00:32:45,799
not very much actual money but its low

712
00:32:45,799 --> 00:32:47,599
price because you're an individual

713
00:32:47,599 --> 00:32:50,119
because the goal is to just get people

714
00:32:50,119 --> 00:32:52,849
involved and hooked into node and so

715
00:32:52,849 --> 00:32:54,979
those two seats will be will be voting

716
00:32:54,979 --> 00:32:57,259
seats and they'll come to every board

717
00:32:57,259 --> 00:32:58,010
meeting and have

718
00:32:58,010 --> 00:33:01,460
equals say to the rest of us in you know

719
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:06,260
board like decisions right and I just

720
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:07,760
had to put in a plug for Drupal 8

721
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,800
because you guys know Drupal 8 we've

722
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:11,540
been waiting for five years for Drupal 8

723
00:33:11,540 --> 00:33:14,090
and it came out yesterday andriy spades

724
00:33:14,090 --> 00:33:16,850
hearts birthday and I also serve on this

725
00:33:16,850 --> 00:33:19,670
board so yay Drupal 8 how many of you

726
00:33:19,670 --> 00:33:24,140
know Drupal yay go learn drupal 8 Drupal

727
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:26,690
8 is going to be really exciting and yes

728
00:33:26,690 --> 00:33:29,570
I do in fact do these both of these

729
00:33:29,570 --> 00:33:32,150
foundations and I'm on about four

730
00:33:32,150 --> 00:33:34,670
different boards and this is another

731
00:33:34,670 --> 00:33:37,100
thing you can do for open sources get

732
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:39,230
involved with this side of the business

733
00:33:39,230 --> 00:33:41,360
because we always need good board

734
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:43,340
members in every one of these

735
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:45,530
foundations to try to help make good

736
00:33:45,530 --> 00:33:48,230
decisions that are going to create you

737
00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:50,270
know the open-source effect for as many

738
00:33:50,270 --> 00:33:51,950
people as possible behind that

739
00:33:51,950 --> 00:33:54,050
technology so if you're interested in

740
00:33:54,050 --> 00:33:55,790
board service it's actually pretty great

741
00:33:55,790 --> 00:33:59,270
and now let's see i have a glorious 11

742
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:01,340
minutes and 14 seconds for questions and

743
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:04,990
i will answer any question that you ask

744
00:34:04,990 --> 00:34:10,159
probably truthfully hi hi so my question

745
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:12,860
is more of like how does a company get

746
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:14,840
involved with knoji as if they use it

747
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:17,389
daily they want to be a part of this and

748
00:34:17,389 --> 00:34:20,270
like we're the guys who have to sell to

749
00:34:20,270 --> 00:34:21,889
our boss like we should be a part of

750
00:34:21,889 --> 00:34:23,929
this not just use it every day we should

751
00:34:23,929 --> 00:34:25,580
also be part of the foundation how do we

752
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:27,830
a company or help you become a part of

753
00:34:27,830 --> 00:34:30,280
the perfect i'm happy to tell you so

754
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:33,080
there's been a lot of research into how

755
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:35,419
open source participation works and

756
00:34:35,419 --> 00:34:39,260
basically it's a pyramid so an Apache

757
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:41,929
where we have good statistics we know

758
00:34:41,929 --> 00:34:45,649
that for every hundred users there are

759
00:34:45,649 --> 00:34:47,990
10 people who are willing to contribute

760
00:34:47,990 --> 00:34:51,080
so about one in ten actually come up

761
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:54,129
with a contribution and then for every

762
00:34:54,129 --> 00:34:58,280
ten contributors there's like one or

763
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:01,280
maybe two trusted committers that come

764
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,930
out of that a trusted committer ship

765
00:35:02,930 --> 00:35:05,090
means you've taken the time to learn the

766
00:35:05,090 --> 00:35:07,190
codebase that you're contributing to and

767
00:35:07,190 --> 00:35:09,740
you can explain it to somebody else and

768
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:11,640
you can conduct code

769
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:15,180
and help mentor other people so when you

770
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:18,030
join as a user and you see something

771
00:35:18,030 --> 00:35:21,000
that you want to fix your job is to

772
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,900
figure out how to submit that patch

773
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:26,160
listen to the mentor listen to the

774
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:27,660
trusted committer make whatever changes

775
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:30,510
need to be made until it's acceptable to

776
00:35:30,510 --> 00:35:33,000
that trusted committer believe that they

777
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,460
have the project's best interest at

778
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:37,710
heart they're not just being mean to you

779
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:39,090
there you know like there's a real

780
00:35:39,090 --> 00:35:42,360
conversation you can have and then learn

781
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:44,820
enough about that process to gradually

782
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:47,490
submit enough patches that you can do it

783
00:35:47,490 --> 00:35:49,890
and you know how to do it and then you

784
00:35:49,890 --> 00:35:52,890
can explain it to somebody else we talk

785
00:35:52,890 --> 00:35:55,860
a lot about that ramp and then lowering

786
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:57,960
the barrier to entry getting people

787
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:00,030
involved in any open source project but

788
00:36:00,030 --> 00:36:02,700
especially node coming up with a list of

789
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:05,930
things that a beginner could do includes

790
00:36:05,930 --> 00:36:08,340
you're having to read the documentation

791
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:11,160
if it doesn't make sense to you and you

792
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:13,200
figure out what the answer is you could

793
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,360
write it more clearly so the next person

794
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:19,110
wouldn't stumble the same way you do if

795
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:21,390
somebody asks a question that you asked

796
00:36:21,390 --> 00:36:24,660
two months ago and you got an answer you

797
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:26,370
could answer this time because you know

798
00:36:26,370 --> 00:36:28,290
the answer now because you heard it two

799
00:36:28,290 --> 00:36:31,680
months ago it's that layering on of

800
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:36,630
generosity and an honest human

801
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:39,030
connection that makes open source so

802
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:41,640
compelling for developers because you

803
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:43,500
really can get your questions answered

804
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:45,810
you really can learn the new thing you

805
00:36:45,810 --> 00:36:48,780
really can gain reputation and once you

806
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:51,870
have that public reputation you can

807
00:36:51,870 --> 00:36:54,060
leverage that open source developers get

808
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:56,910
paid thirty percent more globally that's

809
00:36:56,910 --> 00:36:58,470
been confirmed in three different

810
00:36:58,470 --> 00:37:01,110
studies now why because we're better

811
00:37:01,110 --> 00:37:03,450
developers because we're willing to let

812
00:37:03,450 --> 00:37:06,300
our code be seen in public that that

813
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:08,190
just automatically makes us better in

814
00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:10,500
fact any developer in the whole world if

815
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:12,450
they knew their code was going to be

816
00:37:12,450 --> 00:37:14,190
seen in public I promise you they'd be

817
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:16,530
more careful maybe better developers

818
00:37:16,530 --> 00:37:21,230
it's just what happens so does that help

819
00:37:21,230 --> 00:37:24,090
good Thank You Denise thank you so much

820
00:37:24,090 --> 00:37:25,340
sure

821
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:29,300
all the way like short term to actually
