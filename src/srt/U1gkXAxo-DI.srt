00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:12,059

I'd like to talk about html5 a little

2
00:00:12,059 --> 00:00:13,740
bit what we're gonna do is talk about

3
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:17,699
what's in it a little bit but we're

4
00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:19,500
focused here in this discussion around

5
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:22,830
what is actually well things that we can

6
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:27,029
put to use right now things that are not

7
00:00:27,029 --> 00:00:30,269
really ready for cross-browser use and

8
00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:31,830
kind of the techniques that we can

9
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:33,899
employ to make this stuff happen for

10
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:38,790
real so what is the stuff in html5 there

11
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:41,040
is a lot of things that people say are

12
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,610
in html5 my definition is a little

13
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:47,340
flexible you know geolocation share

14
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:49,920
let's call that html5 css3 probably not

15
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,449
but you know there's a lot of things

16
00:00:51,449 --> 00:00:55,829
that are on the edge the orientation

17
00:00:55,829 --> 00:00:59,780
events probably not in html5 but

18
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:03,750
probably pretty cool anyways so I'm fine

19
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:05,970
with that its kind of falling into the

20
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:14,400
pool shiny stuff a bucket at the last

21
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:22,500
James Caan I put out this site html5

22
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,530
readiness and the main idea here is that

23
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:27,210
we're not dealing with waiting for html5

24
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:29,220
to be ready we're waiting for features

25
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:30,840
with inside html5 to be ready all these

26
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:33,119
features are implemented incrementally

27
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:36,329
across browsers so think of it that way

28
00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:39,030
instead of you know what are the big

29
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:42,060
things so for instance like at font-face

30
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:47,310
in css3 has had support in ie6 578

31
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:50,820
everything something like drag-and-drop

32
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:52,560
how support an IE because that's where

33
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,670
the spec came from same thing with

34
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:55,710
content editable but then you look at

35
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:58,320
something like the indexed index DB and

36
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,899
that doesn't really have great support

37
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:06,780
yet so yeah but if we take a look at all

38
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:09,929
of all of the html5 features kind of

39
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:13,790
what how can we break these up so I

40
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:15,930
think we can break them up like this so

41
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:18,480
here we have dependable features and

42
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,530
these are the things that we can use

43
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:22,510
across all the IES

44
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:25,730
pretty comfortably roughly usable might

45
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:27,410
take a little bit more work but you can

46
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:30,650
do it for real experimental are cool

47
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:31,940
things to play with and enhance the

48
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:34,130
experience with but might not be ready

49
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:37,190
for for prime time for everyone and edge

50
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:41,020
features and these are the things that

51
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:43,280
you know people are experimenting with

52
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,510
and there's a lot of cool stuff

53
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:47,330
happening there but certainly not going

54
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:48,560
to fly too well in a production

55
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,900
environment where you have a wide swath

56
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:55,340
of browsers and I play so I've kind of

57
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:57,680
broken up a lot of these things so

58
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,870
inside dependable features I think these

59
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:01,670
things these things you can feel

60
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:06,160
extremely confident using so the doctype

61
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:09,920
that's about it no big hairy thing its

62
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,600
case insensitive it can be all in caps

63
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:16,100
can be lower case it could be mixed case

64
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:18,470
if you like to go like the myspace style

65
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:22,280
of capitalizing that's cool too it'll

66
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,390
still keep it in standards mode

67
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:26,329
everywhere car set we used to have as

68
00:03:26,329 --> 00:03:28,489
http-equiv content-type blah blah blah

69
00:03:28,489 --> 00:03:30,920
sucky thing now we got medic are set

70
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:37,329
it's beautiful you just like an HTML for

71
00:03:37,329 --> 00:03:41,720
you can self close your tags or not you

72
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:46,510
can throw quotes around things or not I

73
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:49,190
kind of like not throwing quotes around

74
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:51,549
things all the time makes me feel alive

75
00:03:51,549 --> 00:03:56,530
it's good but it's fine if you don't

76
00:03:56,530 --> 00:03:58,850
quote to make you feel safe makes you

77
00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:00,530
feel good too I understand that that's

78
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:02,780
fine html5 is extremely flexible you

79
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:04,220
know you can kind of do whatever side

80
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:06,049
you want validators not going to

81
00:04:06,049 --> 00:04:08,630
complain too much pipe attributes are

82
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:11,390
gone I six never needed them we don't

83
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:12,890
need them make it as get rid of all of

84
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:15,829
them new semantic tags article navin

85
00:04:15,829 --> 00:04:19,579
section we've solved the problems with

86
00:04:19,579 --> 00:04:22,160
them I didn't style them it couldn't

87
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,920
print them the html5 shim

88
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:28,250
has fixes for both those things the

89
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:30,590
entire html5 shim is in modernizer so

90
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:32,450
you can kind of like pick which one you

91
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:35,570
want to use it is the same thing so

92
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:42,020
those are a go the data attributes are

93
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:47,240
rad there yeah you know in HTML for the

94
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:49,790
spec says if e as a browser you

95
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:51,410
encounter an attribute that you're

96
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:54,350
unfamiliar with just ignore it you're

97
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:55,070
not going to have to worry about

98
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:56,570
anything breaking here of course in

99
00:04:56,570 --> 00:05:00,020
html5 we also get a data set property on

100
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:04,670
Dom elements and that of course is

101
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:06,170
something that we have to wait for

102
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:08,240
support for but using like get attribute

103
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,860
for instance it's not too heavy of a

104
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:11,660
cost so we can kind of go ahead with

105
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:15,830
this one in content editable I love this

106
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:19,700
guy um oh yeah then I made it constant

107
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:21,110
edible because I was like all of these

108
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:22,760
such a good demo if I can just type in

109
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,320
here but then when i have a link i can't

110
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:29,660
actually click it that's genius ok you

111
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:31,100
want to correct the spelling on mine

112
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:42,110
 oh alright we'll see that maybe

113
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:47,690
oh alright we'll see that maybe
later

114
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:50,160
yeah okay I just got show this because

115
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,510
it's like the baddest-ass thing in the

116
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:56,550
world yeah okay here's a source the body

117
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:59,850
is totally empty in the head we just

118
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:01,710
have mostly a style tag that has content

119
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:04,440
editable on it but then the really crazy

120
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:07,050
 is that head title and style are

121
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:10,170
is that head title and style are
all display block bodies display none so

122
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:12,690
when we're actually looking at this this

123
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:15,780
is the style tag that we're actually

124
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:18,570
editing so then you know I can change

125
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:22,860
the color of the text to white and I

126
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:25,020
like fuchsia because it's a challenge to

127
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:30,570
spell it's like yeah oh yeah so we

128
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:35,670
watch the uh uh yeah anyways it's good

129
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:40,050
one all right so now those are the

130
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:41,340
things you can feel really comfortable

131
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:44,900
using for my six and up you're good

132
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:49,500
these ones audion video was designed for

133
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,150
the fall back case we want to know if

134
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:56,850
there's not going to be support so it's

135
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:59,760
pretty pretty damn beautiful how this

136
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:02,460
works right so video for everyone back

137
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:03,780
rock came and kind of popularized this

138
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:06,630
technique we have the video tag the

139
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:07,890
source attribute is calling out are

140
00:07:07,890 --> 00:07:09,300
three different codecs that we need to

141
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:12,570
support mp4 needs to be first because of

142
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:15,480
a bug in the ipad that is now fixed but

143
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:18,330
keep it first for now and then anyways

144
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:21,270
we we throw a flash object in there any

145
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:22,980
non supporting browser kind of ignores

146
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:25,320
the video tags or source tags and then

147
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:28,650
just dives right for that i will point

148
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:32,160
out of course though if let's say that

149
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:38,390
you like you only want to serve mp4 s if

150
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:40,890
you do this technique and you only

151
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:43,260
include the mp4 firefox for instance

152
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:45,740
which doesn't support that codec will

153
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:48,030
try and use the video tag it won't be

154
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:49,530
like Oh use the video tag but then I

155
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:50,970
can't use that code XO then I'll fall

156
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:53,460
back to the flash doesn't do that so you

157
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:55,020
actually have to use JavaScript and use

158
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:57,240
the can play type method to see can I

159
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,660
use this codec in this browser if not

160
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:01,250
then I'll just switch everything in for

161
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:04,070
the flash object but in general and this

162
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:06,230
sort of technique you get a get a good

163
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:14,210
amount of coverage yeah okay canvas

164
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:17,420
we've had X canvas from Eric Cartman's

165
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:19,310
in Google for a long time bringing

166
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:22,160
support through vml to the other

167
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:26,420
browsers I love this demo by tab Atkins

168
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:32,140
he's a standards guy it basically just

169
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:35,150
writes the each frame of the video tag

170
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:37,610
to a canvas writes the bright the

171
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:39,830
brightness levels and then converts that

172
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:43,760
into a ski on that side I thought that

173
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,920
was fun so I like kind of tweaked it and

174
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,480
you can adjust the resolution make a

175
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:51,380
little more fine or more rough and I was

176
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:52,400
like I think we could do this even

177
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:55,310
better so now we're gonna do the same

178
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:59,279
trick html5 video

179
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:01,649
but we're going to construct a 3d cube

180
00:09:01,649 --> 00:09:05,189
using 2d transforms so that all the

181
00:09:05,189 --> 00:09:09,899
sides are kind of all ascii i can still

182
00:09:09,899 --> 00:09:11,639
manipulate and then we'll like pay the

183
00:09:11,639 --> 00:09:13,889
edges for a nice little effect here but

184
00:09:13,889 --> 00:09:16,649
the cool thing you know with using the

185
00:09:16,649 --> 00:09:19,110
native things is no I just mean you know

186
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:21,569
flipped around to the back side you know

187
00:09:21,569 --> 00:09:22,860
this is just an element and I can

188
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:25,290
manipulate it any way that I want and

189
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:26,670
that's where like the real power of

190
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:30,540
using you no html5 video in comparison

191
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:32,639
to flash pays off that these things just

192
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:38,850
like work together SVG SVG web is a

193
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:41,339
flash-based shim that provides support

194
00:09:41,339 --> 00:09:43,439
for non-sporting browsers so that's

195
00:09:43,439 --> 00:09:45,059
pretty good to go geo locations not too

196
00:09:45,059 --> 00:09:49,379
hard web sockets socket i/o by guillermo

197
00:09:49,379 --> 00:09:51,959
is a really nice library that provides

198
00:09:51,959 --> 00:09:54,620
support from I think I five and up

199
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:57,540
through flash actually mimics the web

200
00:09:57,540 --> 00:10:00,990
socket API through flash drag-and-drop

201
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:02,790
like I said it comes from an i spec

202
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:05,490
input auto focus in place older you know

203
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:08,540
placeholders kind of this interaction

204
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:11,459
it's you know easy trivial to to Nick

205
00:10:11,459 --> 00:10:12,959
and JavaScript so we can just detect

206
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:14,850
support for that use it if it's their

207
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:19,759
fall back if it's not for experimental

208
00:10:19,759 --> 00:10:22,829
the form input types so like input type

209
00:10:22,829 --> 00:10:24,389
equals date will just give you a date

210
00:10:24,389 --> 00:10:27,029
picker it's beautiful input type equals

211
00:10:27,029 --> 00:10:29,910
color ideally would give you a color

212
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:31,829
picker these are not widely implemented

213
00:10:31,829 --> 00:10:34,889
yet opera has the best support mobile

214
00:10:34,889 --> 00:10:37,139
safari does a few key board tricks like

215
00:10:37,139 --> 00:10:39,240
if you say it's a input type tell little

216
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:42,620
change the keyboard layout to be numbers

217
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:47,250
but we're getting there a metering

218
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:51,649
progress progress so these are just

219
00:10:51,649 --> 00:10:54,240
elements on the page I'll just abuse

220
00:10:54,240 --> 00:11:03,079
source

221
00:11:03,089 --> 00:11:07,480
yeah so it's just the top one is an

222
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:10,300
indeterminate progress bar because

223
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:14,080
there's no value on it but you can set

224
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:16,540
values and meter works the same way it

225
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:18,250
kind of gives an indication of how full

226
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:20,170
things are you can kind of set the

227
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:24,250
optimum fullness it's pretty cool but

228
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:29,950
it's so far this is only in WebKit web

229
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:33,519
sequel database is most popularly used

230
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:38,050
by things like mobile gmail but the

231
00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:40,149
support is going to be limited to Safari

232
00:11:40,149 --> 00:11:44,380
and chrome Mobile Safari that's it I

233
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:49,630
believe I 9 IE eventually will implement

234
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:52,450
index database I don't believe it's

235
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:56,200
going into i9 Chrome will support index

236
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,240
database which is essentially competitor

237
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,820
Firefox will also add that an opera will

238
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:05,170
follow suit as well web storage so local

239
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:09,000
storage and session storage web workers

240
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,640
WebGL I show off this demo we released

241
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:14,110
this just a short bit ago and I think

242
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:20,140
it's badass I also like this is one of

243
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:22,329
my favorite parts of WebGL is that you

244
00:12:22,329 --> 00:12:24,070
get all the polygons and things coming

245
00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:25,779
in as the textures are loading in so

246
00:12:25,779 --> 00:12:28,420
it's very like I just love that the

247
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:30,310
movement still continues as the

248
00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:32,440
experience is loading in I think it's

249
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:36,670
really fun so always fun to look at

250
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:37,839
frame rates and increased numbers of

251
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:45,520
fishes 200 fish a change the view come

252
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:51,339
outside go I like I like to take let's

253
00:12:51,339 --> 00:12:55,110
say you'll do take off the tank yeah

254
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:57,579
almost having float around inside there

255
00:12:57,579 --> 00:13:00,459
take off add some lasers maybe on the

256
00:13:00,459 --> 00:13:01,620
sharks

257
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:07,350
I think so smart l on the keyboard no

258
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:14,040
one knows all right let's roll file API

259
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:17,700
this is rad so actually a Googler just

260
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:19,140
put this out recently it was on a

261
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:24,980
unhappy news yeah okay so dropbox com

262
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:28,710
just drag a file into it so i'll drag in

263
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:34,860
a kool-aid man and childhood

264
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:41,610
embarrassing picture and so I'm just

265
00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:44,850
dragging the files into the browser it

266
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:46,620
immediately absorbs it through the final

267
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:50,930
API and drag and drop then I can use a

268
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:53,190
html5 drag and drop in here to kind of

269
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:55,980
reorder the things to kind of go back

270
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:58,620
and forth and at the same time it was

271
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:00,960
uploading all these to the server and if

272
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:03,930
you notice the URL already changed to

273
00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:06,120
something brand new and unique so that I

274
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,500
could send this to a friend so it uses

275
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:10,770
html5 history's push state to give me a

276
00:14:10,770 --> 00:14:12,570
brand new URL without page changing

277
00:14:12,570 --> 00:14:15,209
which out the page refreshing so then I

278
00:14:15,209 --> 00:14:17,250
can send it to a friend and have all

279
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:22,230
these pictures so that's the file API

280
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:24,900
push say drag and drop kind of comboing

281
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:28,589
together networks now in chrome six and

282
00:14:28,589 --> 00:14:34,890
firefox 36 i believe so yeah it's really

283
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:40,260
rad for more edges feature ishness I

284
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:42,630
know how do I accelerations it's kind of

285
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:44,550
a feature its landing in different

286
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,560
places at different times I definitely

287
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:49,500
got out of the game and accelerated

288
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:54,110
everything on on vista and 7 of course

289
00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:57,480
chrome and firefox are doing a hardware

290
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:00,870
acceleration for nearly all the same

291
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:04,890
things you know 3d transforms

292
00:15:04,890 --> 00:15:12,670
can 2d canvas all that on vista 7 XP you

293
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:16,840
know snow leopard linux indexdb i

294
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:20,970
already covered orientation we saw i

295
00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:24,490
like lamentation it's it's a little

296
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:26,470
finicky so if you use it you know

297
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:31,390
especially on a mac you kind of want you

298
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:32,890
can add a little bit of dampening with a

299
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:36,070
WebKit transition and it will make so I

300
00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:41,200
edit it here otherwise yeah you can kind

301
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,140
of like make it look drunk a little bit

302
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:45,550
so I can turn up the transition to like

303
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:56,080
one second yeah and then oh yeah drunk

304
00:15:56,080 --> 00:16:02,110
if I your orientation protect device is

305
00:16:02,110 --> 00:16:03,940
really rad and sony ericsson is is

306
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:06,460
really leading the charge here you know

307
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:10,390
this is a sane be on html5 devices

308
00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:14,020
sometimes called html5 but it is so rad

309
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:20,560
it is HTML like 10 maybe you know so

310
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:23,950
basically just using a you know straight

311
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:28,630
up markup we can go into read a webcam

312
00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:30,520
device element I can allow the web

313
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:35,370
application to access yeah Michael BAM

314
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:37,540
and then we can also connect

315
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:41,860
peer-to-peer to another user and go back

316
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:43,060
and forth I mean this is just like

317
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:46,380
straight up HTML that enables this now

318
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:49,360
is really exciting so I can't wait until

319
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:53,830
we started landing this the audio data

320
00:16:53,830 --> 00:16:58,380
API I want to mention a Firefox is

321
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:01,150
shipping this in and Firefox 4 and it's

322
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:02,620
really exciting so not only can you

323
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:04,569
synthesize audio on the fly but you can

324
00:17:04,569 --> 00:17:06,970
also read all the spectrum data and

325
00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:09,670
essentially provide visualizations so

326
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:10,659
they did a really nice

327
00:17:10,659 --> 00:17:21,009
demo showing all this stuff and but one

328
00:17:21,009 --> 00:17:22,449
thing that's worth pointing out is that

329
00:17:22,449 --> 00:17:28,720
the guy from google is writing a spec

330
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,519
for this and what's in the spec

331
00:17:30,519 --> 00:17:32,979
currently doesn't match what Firefox is

332
00:17:32,979 --> 00:17:34,989
implemented that's cool which is Firefox

333
00:17:34,989 --> 00:17:36,609
is going to be changing their API to

334
00:17:36,609 --> 00:17:41,409
match the spec later on so spectrum data

335
00:17:41,409 --> 00:17:43,779
we're reading this just straight off

336
00:17:43,779 --> 00:17:46,479
with it's on file we can do cool things

337
00:17:46,479 --> 00:17:58,750
like that a little bit of this

338
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:04,220
visualization happy town is a really

339
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:08,430
javascript-based feet detector more that

340
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:11,250
then will like combo 2d canvas with

341
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:14,820
WebGL because that seems necessary and

342
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:17,910
beautiful

343
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:23,380
so awesome so Firefox a group there's an

344
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:25,930
experimental working group working on

345
00:18:25,930 --> 00:18:27,700
their sniffing and ass a lot of the guys

346
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:31,720
from processing J is actually so WebKit

347
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:33,850
has an implementation of this with a

348
00:18:33,850 --> 00:18:37,240
special WebKit audio build you can try

349
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:40,960
there's a bunch of demos out there to a

350
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:43,090
little different but like i said the api

351
00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:46,000
is still kind of in flux input type

352
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,910
input not type speech just attribute

353
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:53,710
speech this is so going to work for my

354
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:59,890
demo i hope this works because that

355
00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:05,860
would be embarrassing otherwise so it's

356
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:08,560
just an attribute on the on the tag so i

357
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:11,130
guess you could throw it on a text area

358
00:19:11,130 --> 00:19:21,400
20 right what mmm yeah honestly i don't

359
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,890
know i don't think i don't know i don't

360
00:19:23,890 --> 00:19:29,080
think that we put a speech like voice

361
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,700
recognition to the browser I think it

362
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:32,560
goes to google first like the like the

363
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:43,320
google iphone app hmm

364
00:19:43,330 --> 00:19:45,830
and then SVG filters which are so

365
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:48,290
freakin rad and only firefox has support

366
00:19:48,290 --> 00:19:51,710
for these right now well like I think

367
00:19:51,710 --> 00:19:53,210
opera has a little bit of support but

368
00:19:53,210 --> 00:19:57,050
it's not not as good so SVG filters in

369
00:19:57,050 --> 00:20:00,590
html5 wish basically you can apply to

370
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:03,020
any element so I have an html5 video

371
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:05,240
with just a standard CSS border I can

372
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:10,970
blur it in verse that whatever some of

373
00:20:10,970 --> 00:20:16,400
that some of that mm-hmm I don't know

374
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:20,060
what's going on there but this is really

375
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:22,430
exciting and I end up hoping that we're

376
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:24,530
gonna I know SVG filters is not going to

377
00:20:24,530 --> 00:20:30,080
be an i-9 but but and I'm really hoping

378
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:34,490
that we can get into web gitsune so one

379
00:20:34,490 --> 00:20:36,440
of the guys who actually a filter who

380
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:38,060
works on the audio data API and

381
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:41,480
processing Jas and a lot of things he

382
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:43,900
kind of combined a bunch of these things

383
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:48,530
so this little button here is a html5

384
00:20:48,530 --> 00:20:50,870
video using the auto data API to read

385
00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:52,100
the audio from it and create the

386
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:54,050
visualization on there we have a web

387
00:20:54,050 --> 00:20:59,180
font coming in rounded corners oh yes

388
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:12,520
gratuitous WebGL um box shadow

389
00:21:12,530 --> 00:21:14,850
yeah I mean this is like this is

390
00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:16,620
extremely exciting to me it's like when

391
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:18,300
you combine all these different features

392
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:19,740
together like you see these demos and

393
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:20,670
it's like this feature in this feature

394
00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:22,650
in this video but like being able to see

395
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:24,960
like seven features come together you're

396
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,420
like this is powerful you know this

397
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:28,680
is really cool that we have this stuff

398
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:34,950
in the grounds again all right okay um

399
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:37,290
let's say you've I'm gonna go through

400
00:21:37,290 --> 00:21:39,930
these fast but come back to them with me

401
00:21:39,930 --> 00:21:42,330
if you've kicked I you to the curb you

402
00:21:42,330 --> 00:21:45,390
said I don't care about I a six just

403
00:21:45,390 --> 00:21:47,250
let's recover let's cover over the

404
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:48,900
things that you have you can now play

405
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:50,610
with you have full ping support you

406
00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:51,750
don't need to do ping eight anymore

407
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:54,420
position fixed things thank God hover

408
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:57,990
selectors first child adjacent attribute

409
00:21:57,990 --> 00:22:00,330
and child selectors are good fixed

410
00:22:00,330 --> 00:22:02,610
position backgrounds min with max with

411
00:22:02,610 --> 00:22:04,860
good these are things we need clearly if

412
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:09,000
you said I seven instead which I think

413
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,560
we're going in the direction where we're

414
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:12,930
going to have six and eight and nine

415
00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:16,590
plus for a long time so seven I think

416
00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:20,680
might actually die before six in a way

417
00:22:20,690 --> 00:22:23,280
postmessage you're good we haven't in

418
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:26,160
ie8 cross-domain xhr for the most part

419
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:28,710
Native Jason you don't need Jason to ejs

420
00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:30,870
anymore dad you are eyes up to 32

421
00:22:30,870 --> 00:22:34,290
kilobytes and I 84 after and focus looks

422
00:22:34,290 --> 00:22:35,670
lords and such stories are both in ie8

423
00:22:35,670 --> 00:22:37,860
even in compatibility mode like you're

424
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:39,870
viewing in ie7 but then it has parts of

425
00:22:39,870 --> 00:22:43,560
ie8 a monster a lot of fun getters and

426
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:45,750
setters on Dom elements so we can

427
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:48,240
actually kind of recreate the html5 data

428
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,820
set attribute and kind of make it work

429
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:54,330
ni ate among other things Cory selection

430
00:22:54,330 --> 00:22:57,030
Cory select are all badass easy element

431
00:22:57,030 --> 00:23:01,410
selection and box sizing which Microsoft

432
00:23:01,410 --> 00:23:03,060
was right in their original box sizing

433
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:04,620
when you combine wit and padding and

434
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:06,210
then it somehow is larger than the width

435
00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:07,950
that you already specified here you just

436
00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:08,770
do this

437
00:23:08,770 --> 00:23:12,130
boy and from ie8 and everywhere else it

438
00:23:12,130 --> 00:23:13,900
actually is the wit that you say which

439
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:18,010
is makes more sense to me but let's say

440
00:23:18,010 --> 00:23:19,780
that you're a cross-browser warrior and

441
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:23,230
you will support all these browsers so

442
00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:24,250
you probably do a feature detection

443
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:25,690
right probably something like modern

444
00:23:25,690 --> 00:23:29,440
eyes right here it's awesome but you

445
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,870
want to support the older browsers and

446
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:33,100
you want to give them some of these

447
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:34,840
features and functionalities so you want

448
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:36,850
to employ something like you might call

449
00:23:36,850 --> 00:23:39,010
it regressive enhancement because we're

450
00:23:39,010 --> 00:23:40,450
going to give these features back to the

451
00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:43,840
old browsers in a mostly consistent

452
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:46,180
fashion and this is not really like

453
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:48,040
doing it twice it's like doing it 1.1

454
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:51,010
times and most of the work has already

455
00:23:51,010 --> 00:23:53,590
been done for you so what I did is I

456
00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:54,700
pulled together all the different

457
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:56,350
scripts that people have done to kind of

458
00:23:56,350 --> 00:24:00,760
do this thing and so we have a big happy

459
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:03,250
list of all the we're gonna calm

460
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:05,530
polyfills I think Remy sharp came up

461
00:24:05,530 --> 00:24:06,600
with this I think it's a good term

462
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:09,040
polyfills to basically provide the

463
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:10,780
support the fall back to shim whatever

464
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:16,330
so we have the SVG web ex canvas shims

465
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:18,370
using either window dot name or cookies

466
00:24:18,370 --> 00:24:20,380
or whatever to imitate session storage

467
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:23,620
and local storage the media element

468
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:25,690
jsuis throw in a flash object that

469
00:24:25,690 --> 00:24:28,120
actually has the API of the html5 media

470
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:31,150
elements and you kind of use it like you

471
00:24:31,150 --> 00:24:34,690
would want to mimicking all the the

472
00:24:34,690 --> 00:24:36,430
input type date picker color picker

473
00:24:36,430 --> 00:24:39,660
stuff so you're you're writing code

474
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:43,060
writing html5 code that is going to use

475
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:44,290
the native things when it's there and

476
00:24:44,290 --> 00:24:47,110
then going to mimic that exact same

477
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:50,680
behavior in older browsers so there's a

478
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:52,150
lot of good stuff in here and I've also

479
00:24:52,150 --> 00:24:53,530
added a lot of things where we don't

480
00:24:53,530 --> 00:24:55,990
really have support for the progress and

481
00:24:55,990 --> 00:24:58,240
meter elements no one's really made a

482
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,910
script that kind of give support to

483
00:25:00,910 --> 00:25:03,910
older browsers for those but I'd love to

484
00:25:03,910 --> 00:25:07,630
get your help and kind of filling in

485
00:25:07,630 --> 00:25:11,800
these holes and you know one of the

486
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:13,180
challenges we want to provide these

487
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:14,710
scripts to older browsers and then it's

488
00:25:14,710 --> 00:25:17,440
like a lot of these little scripts so we

489
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,540
have none a new thing from the author of

490
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:20,790
go to GIS

491
00:25:20,790 --> 00:25:22,890
and co-author of a purge is Alex Sexton

492
00:25:22,890 --> 00:25:27,260
we have yep nope yep nope is a

493
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:30,770
conditional script loader and so it uses

494
00:25:30,770 --> 00:25:33,870
lab jass under the hood and so

495
00:25:33,870 --> 00:25:36,150
essentially this is it so we're going to

496
00:25:36,150 --> 00:25:39,120
just do a test so modernizer indexdb

497
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,190
this is going to return either true or

498
00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:44,280
false yep if it does return true we're

499
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:47,580
going to include these files otherwise

500
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:50,850
we're going to chuck in these and we so

501
00:25:50,850 --> 00:25:52,290
we can get the benefits of a dynamic

502
00:25:52,290 --> 00:25:55,860
strip loader added with conditional in

503
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:57,810
this so we can do our future detect it's

504
00:25:57,810 --> 00:26:04,080
on that and if that sounds like too much

505
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,900
work you could make money chrome web

506
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:10,620
store I hear it's pretty awesome so

507
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:12,620
basically you know you build a web app

508
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:14,460
you can throw it in the Chrome Web Store

509
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:15,840
you're going to have much higher

510
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,300
discoverability and you can make money

511
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:22,020
on it which is a novel idea you can also

512
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:23,670
play with all the cool things that are

513
00:26:23,670 --> 00:26:25,650
in chrome that might not be in other

514
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:27,150
browsers or we might be implementing

515
00:26:27,150 --> 00:26:29,520
them before other people you have a lot

516
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,710
more storage desktop-based notifications

517
00:26:31,710 --> 00:26:34,110
the WebGL the dragon and drag out kind

518
00:26:34,110 --> 00:26:35,370
of stuff the speech attribute which I

519
00:26:35,370 --> 00:26:39,860
showed you orientation that's exciting

520
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:45,510
so next steps um like I said I'd love to

521
00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:47,820
get some help with some of those

522
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:51,930
remaining polyfills I think this is a

523
00:26:51,930 --> 00:26:54,150
this document right now is on the

524
00:26:54,150 --> 00:26:59,160
moderniser wiki but I think I think

525
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,330
there's a lot of places where we can

526
00:27:00,330 --> 00:27:03,870
kind of make html5 as cross-browser as

527
00:27:03,870 --> 00:27:05,280
possible and it won't be like totally

528
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:06,510
possible and there's going to be

529
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:07,830
decisions where developers again you

530
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:10,950
have to choose adding this shim to add

531
00:27:10,950 --> 00:27:12,690
consistency is just not worth the

532
00:27:12,690 --> 00:27:14,070
performance hit and so we're not going

533
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:16,350
in cluding and that's fine but it's good

534
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:23,370
to have the option in addition to the

535
00:27:23,370 --> 00:27:26,010
features of when I six and seven dies

536
00:27:26,010 --> 00:27:27,720
the new features that you have there's a

537
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:29,299
lot of stuff like em

538
00:27:29,299 --> 00:27:32,119
if you said that you know Firefox 3.8 to

539
00:27:32,119 --> 00:27:33,860
you then you can use in line display

540
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:37,220
inline block Firefox 35 dies to you have

541
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:41,779
a lot more things available so I love

542
00:27:41,779 --> 00:27:44,360
help kind of gathering those up so that

543
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:46,309
we can have a nice document to say when

544
00:27:46,309 --> 00:27:48,320
you kill off this browser we can use all

545
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:50,210
this brand-new stuff also has that

546
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:52,489
jeaious that Pete Higgins announced

547
00:27:52,489 --> 00:27:55,129
yesterday is going to kind of lay some

548
00:27:55,129 --> 00:27:56,330
groundwork for doing a lot of this

549
00:27:56,330 --> 00:28:00,379
testing as well I encourage you to throw

550
00:28:00,379 --> 00:28:06,470
this in your pages so basically we're

551
00:28:06,470 --> 00:28:08,570
going to always force the eyes latest

552
00:28:08,570 --> 00:28:12,590
rendering mode this is a really smart

553
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:14,509
move there's I've been hearing reports

554
00:28:14,509 --> 00:28:16,999
and I'd love to talk to Microsoft a

555
00:28:16,999 --> 00:28:18,710
little bit more about this but it seems

556
00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:20,720
like an i-9 it's a little bit more

557
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:23,720
aggressive about falling back into ice

558
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:27,799
ie8 mode then we were seeing in ie8 and

559
00:28:27,799 --> 00:28:29,600
like something in your CSS might trigger

560
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:32,119
it and so if you want all the benefits

561
00:28:32,119 --> 00:28:34,549
of I&I in which you do it's good to just

562
00:28:34,549 --> 00:28:37,249
say I'm opting into this please give me

563
00:28:37,249 --> 00:28:41,149
the best experience possible so the

564
00:28:41,149 --> 00:28:43,340
second part is chrome frame this does

565
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:45,889
not prompt use you your users to install

566
00:28:45,889 --> 00:28:47,749
it just says if they have it I want to

567
00:28:47,749 --> 00:28:51,710
use it so this is a meta tag that you

568
00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:53,330
can also just send this as an HTTP

569
00:28:53,330 --> 00:28:55,009
header does the exact same thing for

570
00:28:55,009 --> 00:29:00,230
both of them that's it for me thank you

571
00:29:00,230 --> 00:29:11,259
for watching

572
00:29:11,269 --> 00:29:15,119
don't know do we okay there's any

573
00:29:15,119 --> 00:29:29,940
questions well attempt to suck well so I

574
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:32,340
mean you could build a web app package

575
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:34,259
it and phonegap throw it in the android

576
00:29:34,259 --> 00:29:39,659
market and then adapt that web app to a

577
00:29:39,659 --> 00:29:41,909
more desktop experience and throw it in

578
00:29:41,909 --> 00:29:44,970
the Chrome Web Store to their kind of

579
00:29:44,970 --> 00:29:47,999
two stores and it'll be interesting to

580
00:29:47,999 --> 00:29:50,279
see how kind of you know where users use

581
00:29:50,279 --> 00:29:53,029
it but you know for now at least the

582
00:29:53,029 --> 00:29:54,869
mobile experience and a desktop

583
00:29:54,869 --> 00:29:56,940
experience should kind of be a little

584
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:58,440
bit different so I think it makes sense

585
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:00,779
that they're they're kind of separated
