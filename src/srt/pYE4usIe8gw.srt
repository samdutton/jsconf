00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:20,320

my name is Anton Kolev I am front-end

2
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,600
engineer discus I also happen to be a

3
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:25,810
giant maintainer giant is a fork of

4
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:28,689
Jesslyn the syntax checker tool and I

5
00:00:28,689 --> 00:00:32,860
gave this similar presentation a few

6
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:35,199
weeks ago at jQuery conference but that

7
00:00:35,199 --> 00:00:37,660
presentation was more about the use of

8
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:40,600
Jason how to use it how to integrate it

9
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:48,040
into your environment but for J's conf I

10
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:49,960
decided to do something else because I

11
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:53,290
feel like you people are kind of people

12
00:00:53,290 --> 00:00:55,269
that actually shape the JavaScript

13
00:00:55,269 --> 00:00:57,850
community so this will be more like a

14
00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:00,460
shout out to you for help on this and

15
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:06,420
other projects so why am I doing this

16
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:09,070
first I run really passionate about

17
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:12,130
language tools and code quality tools so

18
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:14,290
basically every tool that helps us to

19
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:17,250
write better code to write faster code

20
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:20,560
I'm really passionate about that and I

21
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:24,430
also really hate all these fear crap

22
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:26,140
about JavaScript that's all the

23
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:28,149
newcomers think that JavaScript is a

24
00:01:28,149 --> 00:01:29,859
very dangerous language and we should

25
00:01:29,859 --> 00:01:33,240
use some subset of this language and

26
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:36,909
this subject is usually crippled so then

27
00:01:36,909 --> 00:01:39,159
they are just afraid to learn the

28
00:01:39,159 --> 00:01:40,570
language they are afraid to understand

29
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:42,100
the language they think that prototype

30
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:44,259
is bad because somebody said so and they

31
00:01:44,259 --> 00:01:46,140
never understand the prototype

32
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:48,399
inheritance sorry

33
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:53,590
so initially I forked Justin just

34
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:56,109
because I needed to I needed for it to

35
00:01:56,109 --> 00:01:59,469
be usable I disgust for our own project

36
00:01:59,469 --> 00:02:03,420
but the feedback was so surprisingly

37
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:05,409
amazing I mean it really hit the nerve

38
00:02:05,409 --> 00:02:07,990
because people apparently don't like

39
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:12,280
Rockford's as much as I do so that's why

40
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:16,270
I decided to expand the project and this

41
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:18,730
talk will be basically about this

42
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:20,680
expansion so while language tools are

43
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,960
important first and one of the most

44
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,670
important this important thing is that

45
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:27,430
they save us time they save us time by

46
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:29,870
spotting the by obvious box before

47
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:34,280
actually in runtime for example last

48
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,950
week we merge a big big branch make a

49
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:41,239
disgust and our build failed because the

50
00:02:41,239 --> 00:02:43,610
jaysene found a leaking global variable

51
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:47,390
error it was not too horrible it would

52
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:49,760
probably work on all sides except for

53
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,159
one side and this one side would say hey

54
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:54,860
I use the same variable i and then

55
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:59,989
you're me out so that was

56
00:02:59,989 --> 00:03:01,280
spotted it saved us

57
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:05,629
I know like hours of G bugging and sighs

58
00:03:05,629 --> 00:03:09,049
and the second one is helping syntax

59
00:03:09,049 --> 00:03:10,670
checkers and cut quality tools that help

60
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:14,120
us to enforce our style rules if you

61
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:17,150
maintain or if you'll contribute to any

62
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:19,730
open source project you know that when

63
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:22,549
somebody sends you a really good patch

64
00:03:22,549 --> 00:03:24,950
they just happen to have it's different

65
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:27,650
style programming style and you were

66
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:29,989
thinking yeah I should either tell them

67
00:03:29,989 --> 00:03:31,280
hey please change your style because

68
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,840
your patches get patches goodbye that

69
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:35,090
I'm not gonna commit it without those

70
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:37,630
changes then you feel like an asshole or

71
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:40,489
you're changing that for them before you

72
00:03:40,489 --> 00:03:41,900
actually like commit occur before you

73
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:44,450
actually merge their pull request and

74
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:45,919
you still feel like an asshole because

75
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:49,310
it's not their commit anymore so with

76
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:51,829
the I will show you example it from

77
00:03:51,829 --> 00:03:54,379
pattern world with the syntax checkers

78
00:03:54,379 --> 00:03:56,329
that actually enforce some kind of style

79
00:03:56,329 --> 00:03:59,090
it's very easy to say if you want this

80
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:01,069
patch to be accepted just run it through

81
00:04:01,069 --> 00:04:02,870
this tool and if it's all good it's all

82
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:08,299
good so this is for like experienced

83
00:04:08,299 --> 00:04:11,750
developers for the newcomers code

84
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:14,150
quality tools they really can help to

85
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:18,349
guide through the language tricks and

86
00:04:18,349 --> 00:04:23,960
obstacles basically when you write I so

87
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,849
remember when I wrote my first jobs grow

88
00:04:25,849 --> 00:04:27,560
applications like it was really bad

89
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:33,260
still pretty bad and so when you write

90
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:35,300
that it's kind of nice to have a tool

91
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:37,280
that will tell only like obvious

92
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:40,310
mistakes you made all the styling issues

93
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:41,490
you have

94
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:43,770
and when you grow when you learn the

95
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:46,500
language and you know like how to use

96
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,840
automatic semicolon insertion then you

97
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,460
just turn on the option and you use it

98
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:55,979
that's fine so they also can guide the

99
00:04:55,979 --> 00:04:59,030
newcomers by providing links to the

100
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:03,930
useful documentation and thankfully we

101
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:07,650
have a quite a few syntek shakers and

102
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:10,590
lenders and all this stuff but some of

103
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:14,940
them one of them is really mean to the

104
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:18,150
users so I felt like we should have some

105
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:20,310
kind of not loss loss is just a

106
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:23,130
reference to Isaac Asimov blood-like

107
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:28,860
rules that all projects they're all

108
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:31,289
linked projects should comply to and the

109
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:34,830
first rule is the program may not insult

110
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:39,509
a human being see this is very sad that

111
00:05:39,509 --> 00:05:41,039
I had to put it at the first rule and

112
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:42,990
you all know what I'm referring to

113
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:45,300
because the most popular project on the

114
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:48,090
web and in JavaScript community is like

115
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:50,870
a giant asshole to developer community

116
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:58,349
so yeah it's never helps for the project

117
00:05:58,349 --> 00:05:59,669
for the community and for your

118
00:05:59,669 --> 00:06:02,280
contributors when you tell them you're

119
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:05,159
stupid after every Patrick read full

120
00:06:05,159 --> 00:06:09,180
request so javascript is really flexible

121
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:11,820
language you can write in different

122
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:15,330
styles and those styles it's not like

123
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:19,169
Python or let's say go where you can

124
00:06:19,169 --> 00:06:20,520
write in different styles but they're

125
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,469
all pretty much the same in JavaScript

126
00:06:22,469 --> 00:06:24,330
you can do basically whatever you want

127
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:27,389
and that's why good lynching tool will

128
00:06:27,389 --> 00:06:29,880
not will confirm to your own style or to

129
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,740
the style of your project if jQuery

130
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:34,169
people want to put the white space in

131
00:06:34,169 --> 00:06:37,259
between the parentheses that's their

132
00:06:37,259 --> 00:06:41,980
option yeah

133
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:44,830
and the third Lloyd's again the

134
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:47,080
reference to this other project so the

135
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:49,690
program must accept patches because no

136
00:06:49,690 --> 00:06:51,940
matter how smart you are people are

137
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:54,220
smarter than you and I learned so much

138
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:57,010
by just running the Jets in progestin

139
00:06:57,010 --> 00:06:59,980
project all those issues and secrets

140
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:03,880
that people file they explain with like

141
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,320
references to their actual script

142
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:07,210
specification why it is good and why

143
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:09,670
they use that and sometimes I was like

144
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:11,950
whoa I'd never thought I can use that

145
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:16,480
and yeah so it's very helpful for

146
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,730
everybody when you're good with your

147
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:23,050
community so yeah let's see other

148
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:28,780
languages I have two examples from

149
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:30,850
Python and go because I really love both

150
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:34,540
languages and so in Python Python has

151
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:37,030
their linters they're very popular by

152
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:38,830
lenient by flakes they check the probe

153
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:41,230
they've just like jslint except for

154
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:43,180
except that Filene actually runs the

155
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:46,210
code so it can detect if your imports

156
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:47,920
are like incorrect or if you have messed

157
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:51,820
up paths and keep 8pi check the programs

158
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:54,100
to get the program against the official

159
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:56,740
Python style guide they have the style

160
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:58,780
guide that if you want to contribute to

161
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:02,790
Python standard library or to Python or

162
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:05,080
something in fact in there so you have

163
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,550
to run your code through the PPA that

164
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:09,040
file which is what which works for them

165
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:11,020
that will not work for JavaScript

166
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:13,120
because of different styles but we can

167
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,520
do something like that but better and

168
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:23,830
flexible so it's good for the discusses

169
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:27,280
a Python shop so and we use those tools

170
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:30,520
the PI flakes as our parts of our build

171
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:33,210
project and I know a lot of other big

172
00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:36,550
Python shops that actually use it as a

173
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:38,890
part of build projects and in JavaScript

174
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:41,200
people well they don't use that they

175
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,960
don't use neither jslint or Jason or

176
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:47,800
JavaScript Lane I I know why but I don't

177
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,960
have time to joke around Crawfords

178
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:53,650
anymore so go go has the

179
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:59,560
awesome oh sorry yeah so uh this better

180
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:04,839
so go has this amazing go format utility

181
00:09:04,839 --> 00:09:07,000
that ships with the actual compiler and

182
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,040
it's not only checks your code it's

183
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,779
actually fixes your code it's prettify

184
00:09:10,779 --> 00:09:13,510
set according to their rules again the

185
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:18,070
go is more like python so it's very it's

186
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:19,900
very hard to be to have some unique

187
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:23,290
style it's pretty much the same so this

188
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:24,940
way ships with a compiler and I'm pretty

189
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:28,420
sure all three go projects in the world

190
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:36,520
use that so now back to JavaScript it's

191
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,110
everything is not too horrible in

192
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:40,960
JavaScript we have those linters jail in

193
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,940
JavaScript lane closure compiler closure

194
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:48,010
compiler linker is really good and we

195
00:09:48,010 --> 00:09:50,170
have nice documentation now we have this

196
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:52,540
better j/s project that actually that is

197
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:58,209
actually hmm moved good articles to the

198
00:09:58,209 --> 00:10:01,690
first page of google search either that

199
00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:03,300
or I have really good Google

200
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:06,130
personalization because all those good

201
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:10,959
and I was like MDC and extra specs are

202
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:15,550
now in my first page near the top so we

203
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:18,480
have that but it all can be better

204
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:23,589
first of all as I said about tp8 we need

205
00:10:23,589 --> 00:10:26,920
our tools to enforce style guides after

206
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:29,470
the my jQuery contour I got approached

207
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:32,140
by jQuery team they said that hey we

208
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:36,520
would like to use Jayceon but we need a

209
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:39,970
way to enforce our style guide for the

210
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:41,470
pull request we're having because we're

211
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:43,330
they spend too much time dealing with

212
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:45,430
that I put this white space here white

213
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:48,580
space there so we need this we need

214
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:50,589
something that is flexible enough to

215
00:10:50,589 --> 00:10:53,620
support custom style guides because I'm

216
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:56,920
pretty sure we have like 150 people here

217
00:10:56,920 --> 00:11:01,950
and we have like 48 different styles of

218
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:06,520
writing JavaScript and we can and people

219
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,570
try to

220
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:11,200
in force one style and make everybody to

221
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,110
rewrite all their code but as you can

222
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:16,050
see that totally failed

223
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:20,680
so next index checkers yeah they must

224
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,420
have plug-in architecture plug-in

225
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:25,600
architecture is important for every good

226
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:29,050
project that wants to be expanded by the

227
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:33,280
community let's say you're writing some

228
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:38,770
Yui widget or yeah and you know you

229
00:11:38,770 --> 00:11:40,330
don't only want to check that your

230
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:42,100
JavaScript is correct and valid and

231
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:44,050
doesn't have obvious mistakes let's say

232
00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:45,430
you want to check the namespace that the

233
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:48,910
namespace is according to your rules we

234
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:51,340
will never incorporate that in Jayceon

235
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:53,740
because well it's your project it's your

236
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:56,830
problem but if there with the plug-in

237
00:11:56,830 --> 00:11:59,230
architecture you can actually do it

238
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:02,380
yourself and it will work

239
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:04,510
hopefully just fine also we have all

240
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:06,310
those nice languages like spin-offs like

241
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:08,490
CoffeeScript and the future version of

242
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:10,990
JavaScript harmony and at some point we

243
00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:13,120
will need to support them because well

244
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,010
people use them and especially

245
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:17,770
CoffeeScript people apparently liked the

246
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:22,300
language so why not and here we come to

247
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:24,820
the Jason project and the project part

248
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:28,420
is the important because based on the

249
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:31,030
feedback I decided to expand Jesse from

250
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:35,380
Jesse syntax checker utility more to a

251
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:39,580
learning project so today I removed HTML

252
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:43,210
CSS linters from Jason because nobody

253
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:45,490
uses that so now it's just JavaScript

254
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:49,630
with JSON syntax checker the latest

255
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:51,430
release that I made during the jQuery

256
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:53,950
conference is now stable release it has

257
00:12:53,950 --> 00:12:56,560
all the options are fully tested they

258
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:59,560
covered by tests but unfortunately it's

259
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:01,480
still the fork of courgettes lint which

260
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:04,360
means first for a it uses pratt parser

261
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:08,890
to parse the search tree b it uses one

262
00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:11,620
letter variables every where

263
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:13,450
like everywhere and it's very

264
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:17,160
frustrating to maintain that code base

265
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:20,800
so but people use the

266
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,690
people use Jason in the scoured version

267
00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:26,200
it's very stable I know at least six

268
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,300
pretty big companies that use it as a

269
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:32,649
part of their build process and so

270
00:13:32,649 --> 00:13:34,899
that's why I decided to expand it so now

271
00:13:34,899 --> 00:13:38,950
Jason's will be will soon be a syntax

272
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:40,990
checker and documentation project every

273
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:43,300
warning every error every option in J's

274
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:48,209
hint will reference to the number of

275
00:13:48,209 --> 00:13:51,010
links to the other resources like NBC or

276
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:53,950
the blogs like where as yes or

277
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:57,880
JavaScript JavaScript network press they

278
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,890
will explain why like for example if you

279
00:13:59,890 --> 00:14:02,230
have a option to turn on automatic

280
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:05,380
semicolon insertion that will have the

281
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:07,690
full documentation of what F dramatic

282
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:09,670
semicolon insertion is why would you

283
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:12,730
need to use that what don't you want to

284
00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:17,740
use that and all this stuff also a plan

285
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:21,700
to make it change the architectures to

286
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:24,970
be more extendable so that you generate

287
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:27,100
you will have yoga basic hair will have

288
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:31,029
a hooks for every lucky band and you

289
00:14:31,029 --> 00:14:33,070
will have a source tree at any point so

290
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:35,410
it's any point you'll be able to hook

291
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:38,430
into some event and say hey if this

292
00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:42,430
function is named like differently break

293
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:45,670
the bill at some point in future we will

294
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:49,060
add more languages support but it's more

295
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:52,480
like future and the most important the

296
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:57,640
most important part of these over the

297
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,589
next release of the next version will be

298
00:14:59,589 --> 00:15:01,240
the ability to create your own style

299
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:03,730
guides basically because I promised that

300
00:15:03,730 --> 00:15:08,290
to jQuery same so you I have no clue

301
00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:10,560
what the syntax is gonna be I don't know

302
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,329
how it's gonna work now because I just

303
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:15,910
started to work on that and well

304
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:18,760
basically this why I'm here I want to

305
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:22,449
ask all your help and you can help by

306
00:15:22,449 --> 00:15:26,140
sending tickets and patches that's

307
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:28,180
always helpful pull requests I am

308
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:30,070
literally dancing around every sample

309
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:32,180
request comes in so

310
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:34,790
you can write documentation which is a

311
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:36,710
long shot because you will never write

312
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:39,220
documentation so have to suck it up and

313
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:41,630
send me links to your very favorite

314
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:44,810
blogs and sites that's that that's

315
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:47,270
really easy to do because everybody has

316
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:50,560
like a lot of good JavaScript articles

317
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,430
bookmarked in their browsers or

318
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:56,510
delicious if it's still around and yeah

319
00:15:56,510 --> 00:15:58,100
just send those links and we will put

320
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:00,529
that into the appropriate sections of

321
00:16:00,529 --> 00:16:02,000
the J mu J s king.com

322
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,440
when it'll be out if you know not a lot

323
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,330
if you know something about the how to

324
00:16:08,330 --> 00:16:11,270
parse about the JavaScript lectures like

325
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:14,839
narcissus or whatever uglify j SS uses

326
00:16:14,839 --> 00:16:18,890
uses I'm basically doing a branch and

327
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:21,940
experiment on writing J's hint with the

328
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:26,300
new elixir and if you want to join me on

329
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:27,860
this project if you want to want to work

330
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:30,910
together to collaborate feel free to

331
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:37,160
approach me after they talk because it's

332
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:39,350
it's kind of fun like even with the

333
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:42,020
Jason giant current code base it's still

334
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:44,900
fun to maintain it and now you can

335
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:46,850
create your own project which I

336
00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:48,800
encourage everybody to do if you don't

337
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:53,510
like me my Russian accent or Jason black

338
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:55,940
in general go ahead create another

339
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:57,830
project I love competition I would love

340
00:16:57,830 --> 00:17:00,470
to see what your ideas are if you want

341
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:02,000
to create another since exchequer but

342
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,380
some other utility like we saw today

343
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:08,390
zero Angeles which is an amazing tool

344
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:10,569
and I think I will incorporate it in

345
00:17:10,569 --> 00:17:14,449
into Jason calm so anything any language

346
00:17:14,449 --> 00:17:18,829
to let you plan to create basically I

347
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:23,630
can help you with my time on creating

348
00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:27,050
them and or I can like just link you to

349
00:17:27,050 --> 00:17:29,809
these celebrity people here that will

350
00:17:29,809 --> 00:17:34,040
help you with the promotion but there's

351
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:38,450
problem what if you want to help but

352
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:40,460
your company doesn't like open-source

353
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:42,800
and does encourage a person so you can

354
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,240
always work for

355
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,250
company that encourages open source and

356
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:49,340
actually pays money to work on open

357
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:51,230
source projects sorry about that I know

358
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:53,929
that's everybody hates that much yeah

359
00:17:53,929 --> 00:17:56,870
and we're hiring like a couple front-end

360
00:17:56,870 --> 00:18:01,700
engineers so yeah so um thanks hopefully

361
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:03,920
it was not very boring and sorry for the

362
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:04,780
delay

363
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:07,340
and yeah talk to me if you want to help

364
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:09,620
with the project or if you want my help

365
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:11,870
with your project or if you want just to

366
00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:16,150
meet celebrities yeah and go to

367
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:19,070
github.com Jesse and J's hint and open a

368
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:22,100
