superfast mobile pages it's open source

75
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:48,480
on github under the apache license and

76
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,989
it's basically a restricted subset of

77
00:03:50,989 --> 00:03:54,660
HTML with rules it's developed within

78
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:56,280
google but it's on an open government

79
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:00,269
model so you know and this video will

81
00:04:04,769 --> 00:04:09,600
seconds and this thing will run oh you

82
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,220
if you how many of you have seen the amp

83
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:13,950
demo how many peeps in Google how many

84
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:17,340
people have heard of google out okay so

85
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:18,570
i can make some stuff up because very

86
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:20,549
few people know about it alright so this

87
00:04:20,549 --> 00:04:22,650
is an app launch partners so we have

88
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:24,160
linked in

89
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,720
pinterest so if you use their app and

90
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:28,540
you click on a link that has amp HTML

91
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:31,530
it'll load that page very quickly and

92
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:33,910
they started with new site since these

93
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:36,340
are all slow sites and you know they

94
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:37,840
want people to access their content fast

95
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:41,110
but anybody can use amp nowadays so how

96
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:43,450
does it work o.o basically you take

97
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:45,220
normal HTML you remove everything

98
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:48,400
including javascript and you replace it

99
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:53,500
oops you replace it with amp special

100
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:56,890
tags and once the special tags your site

101
00:04:56,890 --> 00:05:01,720
loads way faster this is the demo looks

102
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:05,410
like this you go check it out and sites

103
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:09,400

104
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,380
everybody it's not for you know all the

105
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:13,450

106
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:17,800

107
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,620

108
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:24,100

116
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,480
when you used amp compared to four

117
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,669
seconds loads in half a second and that

118
00:05:48,669 --> 00:05:50,320
