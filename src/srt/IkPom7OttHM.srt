[Music]

2
00:00:16,609 --> 00:00:19,770
so hi everyone I'm passenger I'm one of

3
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:21,060
the organizers of node BOTS

4
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:25,109
I have chato and a who also organizing

5
00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:27,779
node BOTS so this is fourth time we

6
00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:31,349
organized node but at Java Script Asia

7
00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:35,489
and so typically what we do is we start

8
00:00:35,489 --> 00:00:39,540
with this what we call a simple bot so

9
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:43,280
it's it's two servos our dinner Nano and

10
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:46,320
just a breadboard and we just control it

11
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,399
and so this time what we did was we

12
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:53,129
started off from that and we try to make

13
00:00:53,129 --> 00:00:55,949
I don't try add stuff to it or remove

14
00:00:55,949 --> 00:00:57,750
stuff from it and just do something with

15
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:04,400
it so yeah the first one we have is the

16
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:13,770
so cameras

17
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:16,320
so everything in here actually run with

18
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:59,810
powered by JavaScript yes

19
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:18,490
so so this is how it was so when you so

20
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:21,460
when you so this is turning left and

21
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:23,920
right so there is orange color when you

22
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:28,870
turn left and right and front it's when

23
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:31,060
you go front it's red and back it's

24
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:40,750
green that's that's pretty much it in

25
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:57,229
the table be careful yeah

26
00:02:57,239 --> 00:03:02,620
so it's by here Ash and his team is done

27
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:07,060
this one so no we let keep it in the

28
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:31,260
last one yeah

29
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:33,610
so if you have seen the Twitter feed

30
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:49,220
this called JavaScript Roomba

31
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:59,110
so you are cleaning but it's affirmation

32
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:43,930
yeah is the next version control them

33
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:45,610
from the command line from the mobile

34
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:51,970
phone Oh what do we have here so the one

35
00:04:51,970 --> 00:05:00,610
you asked for this is a note cat it's

36
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:03,010
for people who might not have a cat but

37
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:04,389
missed one of the most important

38
00:05:04,389 --> 00:05:09,160
features of a cat which is crawling

39
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,760
around a table and knocking stuff over

40
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:16,330
so that's exactly what it does it's

41
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:18,940
gonna search for stuff around it it has

42
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:22,840
like a pattern and once it's find

43
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:28,540
something hopefully it's not gonna do it

44
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:33,690
second try it uses a proximity sensor to

45
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:35,580
see that it has an obstacle then it

46
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:41,499
proceeds to ram it off the table

47
00:05:41,509 --> 00:05:47,520
it's a ultrasonic sensor no I think I

48
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:55,410
pressed something do it do it yeah as

49
00:05:55,410 --> 00:05:57,240
you can see it's mostly like a cat

50
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:17,849
pretty useless yeah it even stopped on

51
00:06:17,849 --> 00:06:20,360
its own I'm proud of it

52
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:30,960
thank you I think the biggest challenge

53
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,780
in building this is that hardware never

54
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:35,849
works like you really wanted to or like

55
00:06:35,849 --> 00:06:38,659
document it or in any sensible way

56
00:06:38,659 --> 00:06:41,490
so you just figure out what you can work

57
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:44,039
with and just try to get your code to

58
00:06:44,039 --> 00:06:48,670
work around those issues

59
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:53,950
[Applause]

60
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:59,760
okay so this what I have metrics

61
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:03,450
animation so my friends and I am star

62
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:07,400
building the website with reactor yes

63
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:11,090
yeah which can do animation and display

64
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:18,420
animation on this grid so and this is

65
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:21,450
the default button so you if you if I

66
00:07:21,450 --> 00:07:23,640
hit this it's gonna display the light

67
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:31,770
here so I start doing my example which

68
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:35,670
is really hard to building this with my

69
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:42,570
friends yeah it's a Jess car yeah so am

70
00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:46,740
I gonna hit deploy button we speed 100

71
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:53,700
milliseconds for keyframe okay but I

72
00:07:53,700 --> 00:08:02,940
think it's broken now so but we have

73
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:07,020
backup I held it I can let let you let

74
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:20,580
you see in this video instead

75
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:27,669
okay here is this okay try to hit deploy

76
00:08:27,669 --> 00:08:30,850
button yeah

77
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:42,729
as it works thank you there's something

78
00:08:42,729 --> 00:08:45,070
happened between me traveling from our

79
00:08:45,070 --> 00:09:02,070
workshop to the stage so yeah okay for

80
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:08,740
for mine this is called blue car because

81
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:12,820
it's used Bluetooth so unlike other car

82
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:19,570
like note cut so it doesn't need why not

83
00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:34,050
cut it actually tail it's a feature

84
00:09:34,060 --> 00:10:12,530
so I can move from afar so we also tried

85
00:10:12,530 --> 00:10:21,200
to make something so so this is what we

86
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:27,020
tried to make so this is basically uh a

87
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:29,840
pump that is supposed to inflate the

88
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:36,370
balloon

89
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:38,920
he promised me explosions beforehand I

90
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:44,770
was like don't tell me I need a license

91
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:46,910
yeah you will have to say a whole day

92
00:10:46,910 --> 00:11:01,490
here yeah so that's pretty much it for

93
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:11,170
that Wow awesome

94
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:15,650
that was impressive in that hard way is

95
00:11:15,650 --> 00:11:19,610
hard I guess like he promised explosions

96
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:25,460
I'm almost I guess maybe tomorrow give

97
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:27,380
them all a round of applause it's like

98
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:32,140
two days of work thank you so much guys
