00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,390
speaking Mandarin even though I'm

33
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:53,610
Chinese but yeah some of you might yeah

34
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:55,829
this is like on TV interview kind of

35
00:01:55,829 --> 00:01:58,020
thing some of you might have seen me on

36
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:02,490
a really huge slide my god yeah so so

37
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:05,670
this is dr. yeah Ibrahim he's like the

38
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:09,319
minister of communications and something

39
00:02:09,319 --> 00:02:11,710
some very important like

40
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:14,320
in Singapore so and then somehow you

41
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:18,250
just put my face on that huge slide and

42
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:20,830
then that's like my my colleague I said

43
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:24,580
wow I'm chance so big yeah it's a pretty

44
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:28,570
weird comment so I'm from Penang you

45
00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:30,700
know a place where all the good food are

46
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:33,310
in Malaysia and then I kind of like work

47
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:36,460
and study in KL for like four years and

48
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:39,760
I'm here in Singapore for like roughly

49
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:43,240
seven years so I'm quite kind of like

50
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,370
you know like feels very local here yeah

51
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:49,470
and yeah so I'm supposed to be giving a

52
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:52,600
technical talk since the beginning of a

53
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:55,180
year and then suddenly Thomas like Kylie

54
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:56,860
tell me to like hey you know you should

55
00:02:56,860 --> 00:03:00,670
give a like a community talk you know

56
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:02,860
like last talk of the day community top

57
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:05,710
I'm like yeah cool cool cool yeah

58
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:07,390
perhaps I should do that you know like

59
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:10,360
and then he invented this wood called

60
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:13,720
self reflect ability not sure if it

61
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,550
exists in the dictionary or anything but

62
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:17,470
yeah it's kind of you know

63
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:21,250
self-reflection so the reason why I

64
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:23,140
think why Thomas asked me that because

65
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:25,810
I've been kind of like if you look at my

66
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:28,720
site this is like my blog archives so

67
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,790
I've been writing a lot of for this year

68
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:34,020
so this year is kind of like a year that

69
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:37,870
changes me a lot so I all I change a lot

70
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:41,170
yeah so I don't really write a lot kind

71
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:43,540
of i write once a year which is weird

72
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:46,840
but yeah kind of cool and then this year

73
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,970
I'm like whoa like building stuff blah

74
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:50,830
blah blah you know like designing stuff

75
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:52,300
and i'll be building so many things and

76
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:54,490
write all of them down all my procedures

77
00:03:54,490 --> 00:03:57,880
all my whatever you know details that I

78
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:00,760
can you know right out and now you might

79
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:04,780
notice that on the third blog post is

80
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:07,600
called being invisible so this is like

81
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:11,980
the the article that article that I

82
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:14,740
write their kind of light changes the

83
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:18,489
people around me as and also myself so I

84
00:04:18,489 --> 00:04:19,900
don't expect you guys to read this right

85
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:21,100
now because you probably take like 30

86
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:23,380
minutes it took me two years to write

87
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:24,020
this

88
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:26,539
and actually publish this I have the

89
00:04:26,539 --> 00:04:29,870
courage to publish it yeah so basically

90
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:31,849
you know I'm this the article about

91
00:04:31,849 --> 00:04:33,830
myself being invisible being ignored

92
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:38,629
being a nobody and I'm sure that some of

93
00:04:38,629 --> 00:04:42,289
you might might think the same way as

94
00:04:42,289 --> 00:04:46,610
well and don't worry am i'm watching so

95
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:49,940
I also built a website called like a

96
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:53,659
website with a project called life where

97
00:04:53,659 --> 00:04:56,720
it's kind of like I document i kinda

98
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,849
like open source my life so not only

99
00:04:58,849 --> 00:05:03,229
that I open source my thinking and my

100
00:05:03,229 --> 00:05:06,110
feelings and stuff I also open source my

101
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:09,199
whole like events in my life kinda looks

102
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:13,039
like this so i registered life it was

103
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:14,210
pretty cool don't mean you know like

104
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:16,430
top-level domain called life so it's

105
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:18,409
like Cian that life so you can register

106
00:05:18,409 --> 00:05:21,110
if you'll be like this for that or would

107
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:25,550
yeah so yeah so it's just time lines of

108
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:27,139
importing events it's pretty cool you

109
00:05:27,139 --> 00:05:31,099
know like cuz as I grow older I start to

110
00:05:31,099 --> 00:05:34,250
forget things you know in my previous

111
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:38,419
life you years so disclaimer this is not

112
00:05:38,419 --> 00:05:41,840
a technical top there's no codes on

113
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,569
these slides so no not really very

114
00:05:44,569 --> 00:05:50,060
JavaScript related mostly jazz you know

115
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:53,419
just non technical stuff so you know

116
00:05:53,419 --> 00:05:57,139
don't echo it's okay no worries but I'd

117
00:05:57,139 --> 00:06:01,130
like to tell stories so this is like my

118
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:04,819
style of giving talks so i really like

119
00:06:04,819 --> 00:06:07,000
telling stories for some reason but yeah

120
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,300
kind of yeah anyway but first let's look

121
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:15,680
at photos so yeah just all this morning

122
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,779
Thomas I show this photo you know yeah

123
00:06:17,779 --> 00:06:20,419
this is like the typical group photo

124
00:06:20,419 --> 00:06:21,919
kind of thing right and then every time

125
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:24,500
you see like oh group photo and up here

126
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,840
like photo of a group of people this is

127
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:32,060
like branch SG it's a local Singapore

128
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:34,370
meetup where it's not real meet up it's

129
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:36,980
like a hang out of pique off like like

130
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:39,640
people of engineers designers and makers

131
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:43,730
and anyone curious about the whole you

132
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:47,750
know tech people in Singapore and we

133
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:51,430
just hang out in a cafe and and talk

134
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:54,080
basically we don't really talk about

135
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,630
that go stuff sometimes you just talk

136
00:06:56,630 --> 00:06:59,150
about life and stuff so it's kind of

137
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:00,290
cool you know like this there's no

138
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:02,210
setting there's no agenda there's no

139
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:05,780
speakers there's no like free food you

140
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:10,040
just go and get food yourself so this is

141
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:12,500
like two years ago pretty random you

142
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,090
know like just grabbing all these tables

143
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:15,590
and chairs and combine it together and

144
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:19,130
then we just sit and talk and this is

145
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:21,980
okay cool so whenever I look at photos

146
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:23,750
of people it reminds me of photos of

147
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:25,460
like you know when I go to school and

148
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:27,050
then my teacher was tell me hey let's

149
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:29,210
take a group photo and I'm like oh okay

150
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:31,640
yeah now I know why you're likely right

151
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:33,140
you know in school sometimes you take

152
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:34,760
group photos and if you look at that

153
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:37,250
that radar is me so it's kind of is

154
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:41,300
always this kind of setting and every

155
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:43,010
time I look at group of like the photo

156
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:44,870
of like group people it always reminds

157
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:48,740
me like Kyle I ok so i watch any me a

158
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:50,780
lot and usually this this kind of thing

159
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:52,130
is always reminds me of so many things

160
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:53,810
it reminds me of this reminds me of

161
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:56,020
school reminds me of things I watch like

162
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:59,270
most of my time so but what does this

163
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:03,310
mean right like it's just a photo and

164
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:08,180
and that's when you know like that's

165
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:10,910
when you know sometimes we have to start

166
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:13,250
for a while and I think why we do all

167
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:15,380
these things right why do we take group

168
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:18,260
photos in the first place why do we you

169
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:20,240
know go like to a place together and do

170
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,670
all these things together and I kind of

171
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:25,790
I want to begin with the beginning with

172
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:28,990
this wheel and begin the beginning so

173
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:31,550
basically start from scratch again like

174
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:34,430
why we do this in the first place so

175
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:36,890
this is like my story on how I get

176
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:38,930
started so first I would like to mention

177
00:08:38,930 --> 00:08:44,840
this guy yeah so Chris Neil I'm sure you

178
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,430
guys don't know about this is this

179
00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:49,520
person yeah so Chris Neil is like

180
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,290
all right there like first internet

181
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:54,110
stranger who helped me so I'll never

182
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:56,410
forget this guy basically because I

183
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:59,630

184
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:02,390

187
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:09,050
something on internet did something

188
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:11,300
wrong and he helped me fix it I'm like

189
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:14,300
wow like why why did he help me you know

190
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:15,800
I don't even know how it looks like I

191
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,720
don't even know his real name actually I

192
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:20,020
don't even know where he is strong like

193
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:23,300
seriously like ah and at that time he

194
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:26,110
you know like time people don't really

195
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:28,190
put their real names they always put

196
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:30,800
their user names like so he's user names

197
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,530
actually CDN and I don't even know what

198
00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:39,440
CDN mins yes so is this light looks like

199
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,510
a fish so if aunt you know I still don't

200
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:44,420
know how he looks like but he kind of

201
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:45,860
like you know changed my thinking like

202
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:49,130
why would anyone actually help me like

203
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:51,260
that kind of thing like a stranger

204
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:53,570
actually helped me like I didn't even

205
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:57,590
ask for help but that moment was like

206
00:09:57,590 --> 00:10:00,440
really special for me and it's kind of

207
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,270
like you know if let's say you're on the

208
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:04,010
street and then like you fall down and

209
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:06,560
someone help you you can see the person

210
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,810
who helped you write but on the internet

211
00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:11,660
I couldn't even see the face like

212
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:14,540
seriously okay I don't even know know

213
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:16,730
like who is this guy and always from

214
00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:19,220
stuff like that and it's kinda like you

215
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:23,270
know started the whole thing about why I

216
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:26,570
you know like why I keep asking why and

217
00:10:26,570 --> 00:10:31,310
and this is the other guy David tensor

218
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:34,210
he is the first person inspire me on

219
00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:38,300
like UI design and stuff so basically so

220
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:39,710
that's when I got started on like

221
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:41,450
learning how to design stuff learning

222
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:43,160
illustrator learning Photoshop learning

223
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:45,590
everything basically you know it's just

224
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:48,350
it's just always this starting part like

225
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:50,780
people who inspire you and then you just

226
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:52,400
start doing things and then it just

227
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:57,090
happens and then anyone remembers this

228
00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:00,390
obviously this is not CSS comp so yeah

229
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:04,710
but anyway so CSS H is the first website

230
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:09,060
that inspires me to learn CSS and no I

231
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:11,880
never forget this and that first demo

232
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:14,160
the complex spiral demo is so cool like

233
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:18,180
seriously so cool at that time it's kind

234
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:20,520
of like it's a background image CSS

235
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:23,730
technique carding now it looks kind of

236
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:26,880
plain kind of you know not so special

237
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,000
anymore but at that time is like a

238
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,610
website that inspires myself inspired me

239
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:36,350
and also a lot of other people and then

240
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:39,390
that's yeah the support is also one of

241
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:42,300
the sites that inspired me a lot of

242
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:44,370
articles not just about CSS but also

243
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:46,020
about JavaScript web development

244
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:50,610
everything and it looks kind of kind of

245
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:52,590
kind of kind of weird now but yeah it's

246
00:11:52,590 --> 00:11:54,150
pretty clear that time it's like the

247
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:57,210
colors and all that stuff so and then so

248
00:11:57,210 --> 00:11:58,590
it's not just like website you know

249
00:11:58,590 --> 00:11:59,940
they're not just about people it's also

250
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:01,530
about the website sometimes you are

251
00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:04,640

252
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:07,470

00:17:17,850 --> 00:17:20,730
I finally get the reason you know all

362
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:23,610
the secrets all the tips and tricks on

363
00:17:23,610 --> 00:17:28,830
good conferences and then so I kind of

364
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:32,000
like you know learn a lot of things

365
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,430
I learned a lot of things I asked a lot

366
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:37,430
of questions and this is pretty cool you

367
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:39,530
know like when you go to a lot of this

368
00:17:39,530 --> 00:17:42,710
place these conferences or meet ups for

369
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:45,320
like the past few years you start to

370
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:47,690
know more things while I started no more

371
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:49,670
things I find out how people organize

372
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:52,810
conferences and events and meetups I

373
00:17:52,810 --> 00:17:55,130
realized that there's so many little

374
00:17:55,130 --> 00:17:57,530
details that most of us don't really

375
00:17:57,530 --> 00:18:01,040
know and it's kind of cool you know like

376
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:03,350
obviously you know if you go to this

377
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:05,450
event you start to get to know more

378
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:07,430
people and then you ask them questions

379
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:09,950
ask them where do they work where do you

380
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:13,310
leave you know like all these questions

381
00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:15,020
will start to get quite personal

382
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:16,670
sometimes and that's pretty cool you

383
00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:20,600
know like and you know and there are few

384
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,520
people who are like to mention which is

385
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:27,710
versus okay cyanea cyanea is a one of

386
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:31,100
the very popular people in in Singapore

387
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:34,340
I mean popular figure in Singapore so

388
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:37,510
she built a website called vsg obviously

389
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:40,970
some of you might know is basically like

390
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:44,630
I call this like a like a engineer thing

391
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:46,760
like when you see a problem you want to

392
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:48,980
solve it so she kind of like see a

393
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:50,810
problem in the let people come Singapore

394
00:18:50,810 --> 00:18:52,370
and they don't know what events are

395
00:18:52,370 --> 00:18:54,230
there so there's no like aggregated to

396
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:56,750
have all events and then just like okay

397
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:58,490
let's build a website and I will get all

398
00:18:58,490 --> 00:19:00,890
the events it's that simple you know

399
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:04,460
like basically it's just a website with

400
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:07,190
events listed for like the next few days

401
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:11,140
that's it and also like repositories of

402
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:14,060
github repositories of people contribute

403
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:17,600
to stuff in Singapore and then after

404
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,340
that you know she even built like you

405
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:20,510
know after all these years of

406
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:22,100
aggregating all the state or she build

407
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:24,050
this website called data that we build a

408
00:19:24,050 --> 00:19:25,790
nice tree which is like a historical

409
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:28,310
data of everything of all the events in

410
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:30,050
Singapore and all that stuff you can

411
00:19:30,050 --> 00:19:33,380
play around with it and then a second

412
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:35,630
person is michael chang you know this is

413
00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:38,480
like a must know guy if you're in

414
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,429
singapore you must really know him so

415
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:42,800
he's like the organizer of PHP cough and

416
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:45,360
he does crazy things

417
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:48,660
so he created this website called energy

418
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:51,600
as the SG so engineer say is when you

419
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:52,799
look at it it's just a web site of

420
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:55,260
videos right like you know it's like

421
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:58,290
YouTube yeah but if you see carefully

422
00:19:58,290 --> 00:20:03,290
right these are recordings of talks of

423
00:20:03,290 --> 00:20:06,450
meetups it's kinda like recording so

424
00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:09,030
every single top in almost every single

425
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:11,309
meet up in Singapore so there's like a

426
00:20:11,309 --> 00:20:12,420
thousand two hundred and forty-one

427
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:15,630
videos and what do these videos come

428
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:22,140
from well he recorded himself and that's

429
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:24,840
that's crazy like but now it's much

430
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:27,840
better because he finally like got some

431
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,419
volunteers to help him but I think he

432
00:20:30,419 --> 00:20:32,850
used to like do this by himself so kind

433
00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:36,470
of like that's a lot of work just to

434
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:39,540
help other people you know like so it's

435
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:41,370
also like an engineer thing you see a

436
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:43,860
problem you want to solve it so most

437
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:45,510
people come to Singapore do say that hey

438
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:47,450
you know you got a lot of meetups but

439
00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:50,730
like how do I see the videos of the

440
00:20:50,730 --> 00:20:52,980
previous speakers like I don't even know

441
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:55,200
like who actually speaks you know that

442
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,540
kind of thing so Michael kind of like

443
00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:59,910
okay let's let's do this you know like

444
00:20:59,910 --> 00:21:02,970
let's record all the talks in all almost

445
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:05,100
all the meetups in Singapore and then

446
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:06,900
when people come we just tell them that

447
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:09,630
hey we got reckonings of every single

448
00:21:09,630 --> 00:21:15,780
talk and now you have no excuse so so

449
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:17,669
this two-person like has been like quite

450
00:21:17,669 --> 00:21:22,770
special to me and I at the end we got a

451
00:21:22,770 --> 00:21:25,620
chance to organize this git branch event

452
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:30,330
together which is kind of cool quite

453
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:37,049
nice and it's it's a very special like

454
00:21:37,049 --> 00:21:39,530
thing for me you know like being able to

455
00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:43,490
collaborate with the people who I

456
00:21:43,490 --> 00:21:49,970
appreciate and stuff like that and okay

457
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:53,529
so I i just kinda I want to mention I

458
00:21:53,529 --> 00:21:56,440
really I'm really thankful to the option

459
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:59,500
because because of him I get to organize

460
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,270
my own meet up so I go to a lot of

461
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:03,640
meetups and suddenly I organize one

462
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:07,600
which is kind of kind of cool so for all

463
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:08,789
these years I've been like trying

464
00:22:08,789 --> 00:22:11,649
thinking of organizing a meter because

465
00:22:11,649 --> 00:22:13,659
it's kind of like you know I want to try

466
00:22:13,659 --> 00:22:15,580
but there's so many meetups out there

467
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:20,200
like haha man so co pjs is kind of like

468
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,809
you know first copies like it's a word

469
00:22:22,809 --> 00:22:26,440
for coffee it's a local coffee thing so

470
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:30,010
when you order coffee it's like like

471
00:22:30,010 --> 00:22:32,200
like you know like like the coffee that

472
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,970
you know right copy is like a local

473
00:22:33,970 --> 00:22:35,620
version of coffee so it's actually

474
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:37,720
different with different tastes

475
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:40,659
different flavors different portions of

476
00:22:40,659 --> 00:22:44,559
caffeine yeah and kind of like it's just

477
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:49,000
a play the word play kind of thing so

478
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,190
copy Jess you know like it's just a

479
00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:54,549
social gathering no talks know anything

480
00:22:54,549 --> 00:22:57,880
no presentation no no no free food so we

481
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:01,149
just go to a cafe and we talk so it's

482
00:23:01,149 --> 00:23:03,010
kind of like get brunch but smaller

483
00:23:03,010 --> 00:23:06,779
version of it so it feels cozier and

484
00:23:06,779 --> 00:23:09,010
smaller groups means you know you can

485
00:23:09,010 --> 00:23:12,010
you know talk in a better way like go

486
00:23:12,010 --> 00:23:15,700
karting soco pjs or the website and we

487
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:18,279
go to a lot of pieces a lot of cafes we

488
00:23:18,279 --> 00:23:21,549
discover a lot of cafes we just

489
00:23:21,549 --> 00:23:22,779
sometimes so there will be a bunch of

490
00:23:22,779 --> 00:23:25,630
students from su TD Singapore University

491
00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:30,100
of Technology and design okay and and

492
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:32,950
then sometimes you will be like like not

i did i send these t-shirts to other

541
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:03,529
people and we have to like get the

542
00:26:03,529 --> 00:26:04,879
stickers and give you the other people

543
00:26:04,879 --> 00:26:07,490
way and then I got this part of

544
00:26:07,490 --> 00:26:09,620
stickers and then it's all user ID to

545
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:11,600
print again and I oh my god this is so

546
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,850
tiring and then organizing meetup is so

547
00:26:13,850 --> 00:26:15,800
tiring and going to meet ups is so

548
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:18,800
tiring and I'm still doing this I don't

549
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:22,190
know why and and I'm not the only one

550
00:26:22,190 --> 00:26:27,710
actually there are a lot of people among

551
00:26:27,710 --> 00:26:31,880
us perhaps like some of us would do the

552
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:34,730
same thing you know like I know as I

553
00:26:34,730 --> 00:26:37,790
said I know a lot more people who do the

554
00:26:37,790 --> 00:26:39,620
same thing in the lights just on Michael

555
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:42,500
assignee they try to be website is to

556
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:46,520
help other people the record Michael

557
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:49,220
record videos for other people some

558
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:51,440
people like organized meetups for other

559
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:54,679
people and sometimes you know you get

560
00:26:54,679 --> 00:26:56,720
free food in meetups and sometimes you

561
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,790
ask yourself you know the free food

562
00:26:58,790 --> 00:27:01,160
where does it come from is it sponsored

563
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:04,550
or is it from from your own money you

564
00:27:04,550 --> 00:27:09,020
know that kind of thing so after all you

565
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:10,790
know like I kind of like found the

566
00:27:10,790 --> 00:27:13,580
reason yeah it's kind of like it's

567
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:15,650
pretty hard to find a reason for some

568
00:27:15,650 --> 00:27:18,380
reason so it's kind of like very hard to

569
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:22,400
find the purpose of what I'm doing it's

570
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24,350
kind of like like breathing you know

571
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:26,420
like when you breathe you know you don't

572
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:27,530
really think about why your brief

573
00:27:27,530 --> 00:27:30,950
anymore it's like so so you know it's

574
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:32,929
just it's like so natural you know you

575
00:27:32,929 --> 00:27:36,140
don't even think about it and the reason

576
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:42,230
is actually very simple so it's all this

577
00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:45,710
a positive feedback basically just all

578
00:27:45,710 --> 00:27:49,400
these tank use all this all this like oh

579
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:51,350
my god you save my life kind of feedback

580
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:53,750
that kind of thing you might get it from

581
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:56,420
from your emails you might get it from

582
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:58,850
your facebook whatever you might get it

583
00:27:58,850 --> 00:28:01,550
from anywhere or people write articles

584
00:28:01,550 --> 00:28:03,140
saying that you are awesome that kind of

585
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:05,570
thing so it's actually very simple these

586
00:28:05,570 --> 00:28:07,910
two words means a lot you know like it

587
00:28:07,910 --> 00:28:12,740
kind of like keeps you going and that's

588
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:14,929
really cool you know it isn't you don't

589
00:28:14,929 --> 00:28:16,790
have to do that much you know that's why

590
00:28:16,790 --> 00:28:20,360
sometimes like it's great that we go to

591
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:21,410
organizers and

592
00:28:21,410 --> 00:28:23,930
say thank you to them and and that

593
00:28:23,930 --> 00:28:25,670
itself is kind of like enough you know

594
00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:28,010
like it doesn't have to be a lot it

595
00:28:28,010 --> 00:28:31,340
really means a lot it like actually that

596
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:39,020
two words seriously so give and take so

597
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:41,600
sometimes I feel like some of us might

598
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:45,530
have had taken things for granted we

599
00:28:45,530 --> 00:28:48,110
always kind of I think most of some of

600
00:28:48,110 --> 00:28:51,110
us like take a lot sometimes like you

601
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:53,270
know when you use a javascript library

602
00:28:53,270 --> 00:28:56,870
you know like jQuery or you know react

603
00:28:56,870 --> 00:29:00,260
and all that stuff and sometimes like

604
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:02,330
you go like that say like lodash or

605
00:29:02,330 --> 00:29:04,520
whatever all right all these websites

606
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:05,750
you know they have really nice

607
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:07,490
documentation really nice read nice

608
00:29:07,490 --> 00:29:11,360
really nice articles like well

609
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:13,880
documentation some people have podcasts

610
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:17,270
or screen cars so many things and then

611
00:29:17,270 --> 00:29:19,370
sometimes you should just stop for were

612
00:29:19,370 --> 00:29:20,840
and think like who write all this

613
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:23,180
documentation how much time did you

614
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:25,880
spend writing all this documentation you

615
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:28,780
know seriously and that's kind of like

616
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:33,410
that's all right and and we start to

617
00:29:33,410 --> 00:29:35,870
like take these things for granted you

618
00:29:35,870 --> 00:29:39,830
know like all these things that people

619
00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:43,700
do for us and we just use it and we kind

620
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:46,880
of like don't give back sometimes so so

621
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,800
my point is that sometimes it's great

622
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:53,150
that you we put some time into giving

623
00:29:53,150 --> 00:29:57,620
back sometimes I even a simple creating

624
00:29:57,620 --> 00:29:59,450
a deep hot issue kind of thing you know

625
00:29:59,450 --> 00:30:02,030
if you found about report it if you like

00:30:02,030 --> 00:30:04,790
see a typo and read me make a pull

627
00:30:04,790 --> 00:30:07,660
request sometimes that simple little

628
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:13,700
help makes a difference so you can do

629
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:15,530
more than that you can give talks on

630
00:30:15,530 --> 00:30:17,990
whatever you know like yeah there's so

631
00:30:17,990 --> 00:30:20,120
many ways of doing things you can write

632
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:24,810
articles help people teach people and

633
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:27,920
see like it's always like about the

634
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:31,040

635
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:32,960

636
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,850

641
00:30:45,170 --> 00:30:47,270
people using your framework when you

642
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:50,030

would like to say this quote so she

678
00:32:32,630 --> 00:32:34,940
wrote this we were all very different

679
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:36,920
individuals from vastly varying

680
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:38,840
backgrounds and life stories with

681
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:41,240
divergent trajectories and hopes but all

682
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:43,220
that didn't matter when we all breach by

683
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:45,440
the work we all love to do me possible

684
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,390
by the lack of a physical distance

685
00:32:47,390 --> 00:32:48,039
across
