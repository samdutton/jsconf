10
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:25,360
so next person we have is Patricia she

11
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:28,689
is the creator of gay fi where you can

12
00:00:28,689 --> 00:00:31,450
make your software gay and your

13
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:34,510
debugging more colorful okay and even

14
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:36,460
cooler than that she can do the splits

15
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:38,829
when I make a dude on stage today but

16
00:00:38,829 --> 00:00:41,469
that's awesome so me later

17
00:00:41,469 --> 00:00:44,110
ask her later so please give a warm

18
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:50,820
welcome for Patricia thanks everyone

19
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:54,340
so thanks for coming to my talk thanks

20
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:56,140
for making it through end of the day you

21
00:00:56,140 --> 00:01:00,460
know it's been busy conference day so my

22
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:03,250
talk a tale of two bundles a lesson in

23
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:10,750
mentorship so before I dive in Who am I

24
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:13,930
I'm Patricia I'm a back-end software

25
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:16,990
engineer at Tkaczyk in Washington DC and

26
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:20,080
you can follow me and tweet at me at

27
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:24,700
queer Pat so in this talk I'm gonna be

28
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:26,830
speaking about my journey of breaking

29
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:30,100
into tech as a bootcamp grad to become a

30
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:32,560
back-end software engineer as a queer

31
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,080
Latinas woman with a degree in the

32
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:40,630
humanities in my talk today I'll be

33
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:42,430
highlighting the vital differences

34
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:45,520
between a negative mentor who actually

35
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,920
blocks underrepresented folks from

36
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,710
breaking into tech further perpetuating

37
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:52,780
the leaders hierarchy omnipresent

38
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:55,900
throughout the tech companies versus an

39
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:58,390
invaluable mentor who nurtures and

40
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:00,880
sponsors their mentees by leveraging any

41
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,189
privilege that they have to open career

42
00:02:03,189 --> 00:02:06,460
opportunities for their mentees then I

43
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:09,129
will further examine how exactly to

44
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:11,890
become an effective mentor and sponsor

45
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:14,129
for underrepresented folks in tech and

46
00:02:14,129 --> 00:02:16,510
this is going to be through my own

47
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:19,400
personal ends and lived experiences

48
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:23,620
so a little bit of background about me

49
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:27,140
so years ago I had a dead-end job as a

50
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:29,750
textbook copy editor at a major

51
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:33,080
educational publisher fed up with the

52
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:36,140
lack of opportunities I would go home

53
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:39,260
after work and teach myself Python some

54
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:42,829
JavaScript I really wanted to try and

55
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:48,230
incorporate programming into my job at

56
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:51,069
my job at the textbook company we had

57
00:02:51,069 --> 00:02:53,890
online versions of our textbooks and

58
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:56,780
they were you can interact with them

59
00:02:56,780 --> 00:03:00,859
through a CMS and I you know taught

60
00:03:00,859 --> 00:03:04,940
myself HTML and CSS to edit our

61
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:09,290
textbooks so at the textbook company I

62
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:12,799
got really fed up I really wanted to

63
00:03:12,799 --> 00:03:17,750
pursue programming more seriously so I

64
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:20,239
moved cross-country to attend a Python

65
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:24,019
coding boot camp in San Francisco when I

66
00:03:24,019 --> 00:03:26,180
lived in San Francisco for the two years

67
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:28,760
after attending boot camp I grew a lot

68
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:31,489
technically I pushed myself by

69
00:03:31,489 --> 00:03:34,280
constantly coding and building side

70
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,829
projects learning new programming

71
00:03:36,829 --> 00:03:39,190
concepts as much as I could

72
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:42,349
learning so many new skills as quickly

73
00:03:42,349 --> 00:03:44,859
as I did resulted in a lot of

74
00:03:44,859 --> 00:03:47,780
metaphorical growing pains learning is

75
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:51,609
hard learning takes energy and effort

76
00:03:51,609 --> 00:03:54,079
continuously stretching your mind is

77
00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:57,769
draining and applying for software

78
00:03:57,769 --> 00:04:00,620
engineer jobs is very time consuming and

79
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:06,799
energy draining so my non-traditional

80
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:09,099
path into tech was very challenging

81
00:04:09,099 --> 00:04:11,930
sometimes I was so frustrated and

82
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:14,329
disillusioned with the tech industry and

83
00:04:14,329 --> 00:04:16,760
the Game of Thrones battle that is

84
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,949
technical interviewing I wanted to give

85
00:04:18,949 --> 00:04:22,820
up a lot it really felt that all of my

86
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:25,010
efforts until learning becoming more

87
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:26,900
technical and finishing lengthy

88
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:29,210
technical challenges were all in vain I

89
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:31,460
felt like I certainly had to prove

90
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:32,800
myself over and

91
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,639
over again in these tech interviews and

92
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:38,050
job searching becomes even more

93
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:41,259
frustrating when your mentors in a way

94
00:04:41,259 --> 00:04:43,419
Gaslight you from progressing

95
00:04:43,419 --> 00:04:46,090
career-wise and discourage you from

96
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:50,349
applying to technical positions so for

97
00:04:50,349 --> 00:04:52,960
more context my boot camp actually

98
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,569
assigned its students mentors from the

99
00:04:55,569 --> 00:04:59,409
software engineering community so not

100
00:04:59,409 --> 00:05:01,120
only did these boot camp

101
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,699
mentors tell me I was not ready to start

102
00:05:03,699 --> 00:05:06,000
interviewing which is that's one piece

103
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,669
but then they never guided me on what

104
00:05:09,669 --> 00:05:12,219
technical topics I should study to best

105
00:05:12,219 --> 00:05:15,460
prepare for technical interviewing these

106
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:18,669
boot camp mentors made what I think is

107
00:05:18,669 --> 00:05:21,780
an unfair judgment call blocking me from

108
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:24,430
network opportunities to further my

109
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:30,699
career these pre assigned mentors from

110
00:05:30,699 --> 00:05:33,280
my boot camp did in fact mentor me in

111
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:36,849
the sense that they tutored me they

112
00:05:36,849 --> 00:05:39,840
tutored me with computer science

113
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:43,949
concepts but they failed to sponsor me

114
00:05:43,949 --> 00:05:47,110
they failed to architect a long-term

115
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:49,930
plan with me and what exactly I wanted

116
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:52,169
to accomplish in my programming career

117
00:05:52,169 --> 00:05:55,449
in my opinion mentorship should not just

118
00:05:55,449 --> 00:05:58,630
consists of only tutoring mentees but

119
00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:00,550
also opening out potential job

120
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:03,729
opportunities as well as architecting a

121
00:06:03,729 --> 00:06:05,710
plan on how to accomplish the mentees

122
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:10,750
long-term goals so during this point of

123
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:12,940
my journey it definitely felt like these

124
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:15,430
bootcamp mentors were in a way

125
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:18,180
weaponizing my junior 'no Segen Smee I

126
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:22,870
felt tokenized so that white software

127
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:25,990
engineer men got Ally cookies from

128
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:27,940
mentoring me so that they could feel

129
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:31,300
good about themselves it's not a great

130
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:34,000
feeling to be surrounded by these pseudo

131
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,099
Ally allies who want to feel woke it was

132
00:06:39,099 --> 00:06:41,139
very discouraging because I felt like my

133
00:06:41,139 --> 00:06:43,719
boot camp mentors did not have faith in

134
00:06:43,719 --> 00:06:47,540
me

135
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:53,680
so with the long job hunt a little bit

136
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,260
of context for my very long job hunt in

137
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:59,110
breaking into tech so after finishing my

138
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:01,630
boot camp I had managed to cobble

139
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:03,550
together about a year's worth of

140
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:06,370
technical experience via a contract job

141
00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:10,060
an open-source fellowship I was awarded

142
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:14,310
at github as well as an internship at a

143
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:19,960
tech health start-up so my internship at

144
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:22,630
the tech health startup was supposedly

145
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:25,650
for a position that was contract to hire

146
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:28,990
contractor hired positions were very

147
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:33,180
common amongst boot camp graduates so

148
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:35,680
unfortunately after a round of layoffs

149
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,350
neither myself nor any of my fellow

150
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:41,130
bootcamp grad software engineer interns

151
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:45,550
received full-time offers so and thus

152
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:48,100
began my very long nine months a job

153
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:51,340
hunt so during this job hunt I

154
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:56,350
experienced many lows external factors

155
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:58,950
made the job hunt particularly difficult

156
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:02,860
at one point I had unstable housing in

157
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:06,760
San Francisco all the while trying to

158
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:09,550
not resort moving back in with my

159
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:12,880
homophobic parents who I was not out to

160
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:15,430
at the time and I really feared a

161
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:17,410
negative reaction from them if they ever

162
00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:21,670
found out I was queer so I was balancing

163
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:24,610
adulting which is really hard while also

164
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:26,350
trying to survive these super long

165
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:30,040
technical interviewing processes many

166
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:32,200
times honestly I felt like I was being

167
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:35,830
hazed by the tech industry I felt like I

168
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:38,520
was a so many like trivia like

169
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:41,039
algorithms and data structure questions

170
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:45,190
that were completely and extremely far

171
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:46,990
removed from the day-to-day job of a

172
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:50,950
software engineer I had so many awkward

173
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:52,790
pair programming

174
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:56,540
or men would just silently watch me code

175
00:08:56,540 --> 00:09:00,020
judging me for solving their problem in

176
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:02,960
a very unique way that they had never

177
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:09,880
seen before so oops

178
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:16,580
excuse me so my lowest point in my

179
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:18,590
nine-month technical interviewing

180
00:09:18,590 --> 00:09:20,660
journey was actually towards the end of

181
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:25,370
my search so by this point of my job

182
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:27,830
search I had failed so many times in

183
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:30,560
past technical interviews I was actually

184
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:33,460
like fairly decent at making it past

185
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:36,170
technical homework challenges as well as

186
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:40,190
technical phone screens and had a decent

187
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:42,470
rate at making it to final on-site

188
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:46,420
interviews so my absolute rock bottom

189
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:51,620
low point was during a week-long paid

190
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:54,370
final on-site interview at a software

191
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:58,220
engineering consulting firm essentially

192
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:01,160
it was like a short-term freelancing

193
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:05,330
opportunity so this was what was going

194
00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:07,190
through my mind I almost didn't even

195
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:10,010
accept the week-long interview requests

196
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:13,220
because this particular consultancy at

197
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:17,110
the time was ten men there was no women

198
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:20,090
you know the fact that their interview

199
00:10:20,090 --> 00:10:23,390
process included a week of vetting their

200
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:27,250
applicants made it obvious to me that

201
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:30,470
most of their applicants weren't parents

202
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:33,740
or caregivers or you know any developers

203
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:35,810
with time-consuming responsibilities

204
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:39,710
outside of the office and then it also

205
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:44,390
let me know that the applicants applying

206
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:48,590
to this consultancy they must have not

207
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:51,380
had full-time jobs as taking a week off

208
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:52,730
of work for most people

209
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:57,380
is untenable especially taking a week

210
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:59,660
off of like childcare or elder care

211
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:03,280
responsibilities it's just unreachable

212
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:06,100
so unfortunately

213
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:08,709
regardless of these red flags I ended up

214
00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:11,380
doing a week of freelancing with them

215
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:14,440
because I needed the money I had to pay

216
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:17,319
my bills and my funds were scarce since

217
00:11:17,319 --> 00:11:21,790
this was such a long job search so it

218
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:24,160
was obvious to me from like the first

219
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,170
hour of freelancing with this

220
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:30,300
consultancy that was a very bad but this

221
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:32,949
consultancy was dogmatic about using

222
00:11:32,949 --> 00:11:36,670
them as a text editor of choice to

223
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:39,519
contrast I love using Adam as my text

224
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:42,250
editor so during my week of freelancing

225
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:45,069
I had to pair a program with each

226
00:11:45,069 --> 00:11:47,800
consultant and it became extremely

227
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:51,040
difficult to pair since every consultant

228
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,920
have their own super customized than

229
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:57,490
bindings so ended up unfortunately

230
00:11:57,490 --> 00:11:59,800
happening was that every consultant was

231
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:04,120
dravite getting so like both driving as

232
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:06,850
well as navigating in pair programming

233
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:09,730
speak so it's very difficult to

234
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:13,319
collaborate with them as they were

235
00:12:13,319 --> 00:12:18,639
hogging the keyboard you know just it

236
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:20,199
just seemed like they just didn't want

237
00:12:20,199 --> 00:12:22,509
to collaborate with me or share context

238
00:12:22,509 --> 00:12:26,889
with me it was just very difficult I

239
00:12:26,889 --> 00:12:29,639
even brought up the fact to them that

240
00:12:29,639 --> 00:12:33,759
exclusively using them was a major

241
00:12:33,759 --> 00:12:36,130
obstacle for me since when trying to

242
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:39,339
collaborate I'm obviously much slower at

243
00:12:39,339 --> 00:12:41,889
collaborating than the fellow

244
00:12:41,889 --> 00:12:44,980
consultants there and unfortunately I

245
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:47,800
was met with a lot of pushback and quite

246
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,990
frankly text-editor elitism so it was

247
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:54,610
really unfortunate so unfortunately this

248
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:57,540
week and did very poorly

249
00:12:57,540 --> 00:13:02,730
I believe it ended in medical flames

250
00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:06,540
because towards the end of the last day

251
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:09,399
the engineers they took me out to lunch

252
00:13:09,399 --> 00:13:13,269
I was kind of like a goodbye lunch and

253
00:13:13,269 --> 00:13:16,899
so unfortunately one of the white

254
00:13:16,899 --> 00:13:18,400
software engineers

255
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:21,400
like extremely like races anti-black

256
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,830
joke to the only black software engineer

257
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:28,089
in the consultancy and so i would and he

258
00:13:28,089 --> 00:13:29,620
made this joke in front of me you know

259
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:31,210
like my jaw dropped

260
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:35,680
i couldn't believe what he had said i

261
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,839
was speechless

262
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:39,970
unfortunately didn't speak up I didn't

263
00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:43,300
say anything I wish I did I was just I

264
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:45,370
was just shocked I didn't know what to

265
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:47,610
say

266
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:51,910
so that was by far the lowest point of

267
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:54,339
my job search I was seriously

268
00:13:54,339 --> 00:13:57,070
considering just quitting tech as an

269
00:13:57,070 --> 00:14:01,300
industry altogether you know I felt

270
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:04,240
super other during the end of that

271
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:07,839
freelancing gig you know I feel like I

272
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:10,720
didn't belong and you know if one of

273
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,900
these like software engineers at this

274
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:18,010
consultancy obviously treated the black

275
00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:21,790
software engineer poorly like how would

276
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:25,180
they cheat me like they wouldn't treat

277
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:30,730
me well if I had worked there so

278
00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:33,400
thankfully things started to look up in

279
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:36,370
my programming journey so in spite of

280
00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:38,290
all of this hazing and all these

281
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:40,660
prejudice prejudice is embedded and

282
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:43,420
technical interviewing I'm here I've

283
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:45,910
successfully broken into tech as a

284
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:49,110
full-time back-end software engineer

285
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:52,209
with the guidance of mentors and support

286
00:14:52,209 --> 00:14:55,660
from friends I persisted I survived a

287
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:59,470
lot of adversity and I was driven to

288
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:02,140
find a company to accept me for my

289
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:06,160
authentic self in my opinion it's my

290
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,170
strong belief that I did not break into

291
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:10,930
tech by relentlessly improving my

292
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:14,200
programming skills because I personally

293
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,610
knew many people who had landed

294
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:18,940
full-time jobs who were definitely less

295
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:22,360
technical than I were I was I believe

296
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:24,550
that the rosy narrative that coding boot

297
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:26,589
camps market to their students that if

298
00:15:26,589 --> 00:15:28,920
they just diligently study computers

299
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:32,250
concepts and build side projects to

300
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:34,620
extend their programming skills that

301
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:36,660
their hard work will pay off in an

302
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:39,089
attractive software engineering job I

303
00:15:39,089 --> 00:15:41,760
believe this is like an incomplete false

304
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:44,940
narrative in my opinion I was able to

305
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:47,699
successfully break into the gatekeeping

306
00:15:47,699 --> 00:15:49,980
that is technical interviewing was

307
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:52,440
because I made strong connections in the

308
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:55,829
career not man community I have this

309
00:15:55,829 --> 00:15:58,019
queer community to thank for opening up

310
00:15:58,019 --> 00:16:01,290
wonderful career opportunities these

311
00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:03,930
more experienced queer not men Engineers

312
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:06,240
lent me some of their privilege by

313
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,930
mentoring me and sponsoring me mentoring

314
00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:12,540
especially for underrepresented folks in

315
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:15,300
tech not only should include helping

316
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:19,079
mentees solidify technical concepts but

317
00:16:19,079 --> 00:16:21,720
also open doors for them in networking

318
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:30,600
and new employment opportunities so an

319
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:33,660
important facet of being a great mentor

320
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:35,940
is not just teaching mentees about

321
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:39,300
technical concepts but opening up

322
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:41,790
opportunities and also architecting a

323
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:44,490
future plan of what goals a mentee wants

324
00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:48,060
to accomplish over time so this really

325
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:50,430
contrasts with my negative experience

326
00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:52,649
with my pre-assigned mentors from my

327
00:16:52,649 --> 00:16:58,230
coding boot camp so I was sponsored by

328
00:16:58,230 --> 00:17:01,410
the queer community they leveraged their

329
00:17:01,410 --> 00:17:03,779
own personal networks to introduce me to

330
00:17:03,779 --> 00:17:06,449
recruiters and hiring managers they used

331
00:17:06,449 --> 00:17:09,510
their name to vouch on my behalf would

332
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:11,850
tell potential employers that I'm an

333
00:17:11,850 --> 00:17:13,650
excellent communicator that I learned

334
00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:16,549
fast and I'm a good team player

335
00:17:16,549 --> 00:17:19,350
thankfully this enabled me to land my

336
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:27,350
first full-time software engineer job so

337
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:30,840
this all happened because I was very

338
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:34,799
lucky that I was thankfully paired up

339
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:38,000
with my wonderful mentor cut my tongue

340
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,250
CLI engineer and pee

341
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:42,440
who is a major positive force in my

342
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:47,180
journey in tech so I first talked to Kat

343
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:49,130
via this inclusive slack community

344
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:52,190
called we all J yes we all jus is a

345
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:53,930
unique in the sense that it's an

346
00:17:53,930 --> 00:17:56,750
experiment to see if a very diverse

347
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:59,090
group of Internet strangers interested

348
00:17:59,090 --> 00:18:01,070
in JavaScript could get along and not

349
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:04,690
devolve into you know antagonist ik

350
00:18:04,690 --> 00:18:08,720
argumentative environment so about two

351
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,880
years ago and we all join us there was a

352
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:13,160
call for mentorship where

353
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:15,590
underrepresented folks were looking to

354
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:17,270
break into tech could be paired with a

355
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:22,040
more senior experienced mentor so I was

356
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:24,320
very lucky cat chose me as mentee

357
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:27,530
I chose Kat as a mentor and it just

358
00:18:27,530 --> 00:18:29,240
happened to be that we are both queer

359
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:32,930
and quad Rican I'm very lucky to have a

360
00:18:32,930 --> 00:18:35,210
wise mentor that is also queer and

361
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:37,760
Puerto Rican like myself as there aren't

362
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,770
many queer Puerto Rican and non mint

363
00:18:39,770 --> 00:18:51,170
engineers in tuk all right excuse me I

364
00:18:51,170 --> 00:18:56,780
got kind of out of out of sync with my

365
00:18:56,780 --> 00:19:00,110
slides

366
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:04,790
okay

367
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:09,460
all right cool so an important pillar of

368
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:16,240
mentorship is technical guidance so can

369
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,640
I would go over technical concepts such

370
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:21,370
as how does the internet work and what

371
00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:24,309
is restfulness I would also ask Kat

372
00:19:24,309 --> 00:19:26,320
questions on how to go about solving

373
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:29,770
coding challenges like big picture wise

374
00:19:29,770 --> 00:19:31,990
like what data structure should I use

375
00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:34,960
what tools do I use do I build a rails

376
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:38,830
app do I build a gem many times I would

377
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:41,920
actually reach for rails new building a

378
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:44,020
new rails app that's my first instinct

379
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:46,570
since that was what I was most familiar

380
00:19:46,570 --> 00:19:50,710
with but cat would suggest many times

381
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:52,809
for these back-end technical challenges

382
00:19:52,809 --> 00:19:56,380
that an entire app is overkill you know

383
00:19:56,380 --> 00:20:00,700
sometimes the building a gem or even a

384
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:04,450
script would suffice and you know that

385
00:20:04,450 --> 00:20:06,520
would leave me more time for focusing on

386
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:09,670
like optimizations Reba robust testing

387
00:20:09,670 --> 00:20:12,070
and like fleshing out any algorithms

388
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:17,190
that I wrote so even more importantly

389
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:21,280
cat would teach me foe paws to avoid for

390
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:24,090
example as someone who is self-taught

391
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:26,470
sometimes I will already be familiar

392
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:29,470
with a technical concept but I won't

393
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:31,600
know the official term that it's called

394
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:35,080
or other times I'll have like read a

395
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:38,200
particular buzz word but I'm not sure

396
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:40,270
how to pronounce it since I've never

397
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:43,690
said it out loud before so an example of

398
00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:47,290
this word was idempotent I had a lot of

399
00:20:47,290 --> 00:20:49,960
trouble you know saying this word out

400
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:53,590
loud and so cat knows I love emojis and

401
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:58,150
I'm very visual learner and so they like

402
00:20:58,150 --> 00:21:02,590
came up with this like I den potent sand

403
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:06,660
emojis the soup is kind of like fun so

404
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:10,090
you know

405
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:12,380
it was it really helped me like remember

406
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:18,169
how to say this technical term so I was

407
00:21:18,169 --> 00:21:22,160
really thankful for that another

408
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,990
important part of being a great mentor

409
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:26,510
is architecting with your mentee a plan

410
00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:28,940
a plan of what they want to accomplish

411
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:33,350
in the future so this is true even when

412
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:35,330
you're meant to you is not even exactly

413
00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:37,309
sure of what they want their future to

414
00:21:37,309 --> 00:21:40,309
look like so in the beginning of mine

415
00:21:40,309 --> 00:21:43,039
and cats mentor mentee relationship

416
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:45,289
I wasn't even completely sure that I

417
00:21:45,289 --> 00:21:47,559
wanted to pursue back-end development

418
00:21:47,559 --> 00:21:50,419
you know I had I was still considering

419
00:21:50,419 --> 00:21:53,659
pursuing front-end development I had

420
00:21:53,659 --> 00:21:55,700
done a lot of like exploration on my own

421
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:58,100
was leaning towards back in but honestly

422
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:02,960
I wasn't even sure so in order for me to

423
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:06,650
make a well-informed decision Kat told

424
00:22:06,650 --> 00:22:09,890
me about specific hardships that I would

425
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:12,320
have to navigate as a not man when

426
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,690
pursuing front end versus back end

427
00:22:14,690 --> 00:22:18,679
development so Kat told me that the

428
00:22:18,679 --> 00:22:20,780
relationship non men have with front-end

429
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:24,169
development is complicated they

430
00:22:24,169 --> 00:22:26,440
explained to me how the tech industry

431
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:29,030
sometimes devalues front-end work

432
00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:33,020
especially HTML and CSS work and that

433
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:34,730
many times this work is strongly

434
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:37,580
associated with non men there's this

435
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:40,159
biased idea that women are good at

436
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:42,380
making things look pretty and that

437
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:45,530
back-end development is too hard so that

438
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:47,510
we're most likely to be siloed into

439
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:50,870
front-end I obviously think front-end

440
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:54,710
development is very complex but that's

441
00:22:54,710 --> 00:22:58,340
that's the insight Kat told me industry

442
00:22:58,340 --> 00:23:02,320
wise that I should just be aware and so

443
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:05,299
this contrasted with the advice that I

444
00:23:05,299 --> 00:23:07,850
got for back-end development that

445
00:23:07,850 --> 00:23:11,090
there's much fewer non men software

446
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:13,490
engineers in the backend and that I

447
00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:16,309
should be prepared at future jobs to be

448
00:23:16,309 --> 00:23:18,620
the only person who looks the way that I

449
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:23,920
do

450
00:23:23,930 --> 00:23:27,810
so another point that's really important

451
00:23:27,810 --> 00:23:31,320
to be a really effective mentor is that

452
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:34,340
mentors should help mentees design

453
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:36,690
personalized strategies on how to

454
00:23:36,690 --> 00:23:41,640
approach the job search so Kath worked

455
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:43,710
with me so we could best navigate the

456
00:23:43,710 --> 00:23:46,290
technical interviewing landscape to best

457
00:23:46,290 --> 00:23:50,610
suit my specific needs so in my case I

458
00:23:50,610 --> 00:23:53,010
was super overwhelmed by all of the

459
00:23:53,010 --> 00:23:54,960
responses I was getting from cold

460
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,270
applying to a high number of tech

461
00:23:57,270 --> 00:24:00,600
companies each week it was impossible

462
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:02,940
for me to complete all of the number of

463
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:04,590
technical challenges and interview

464
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:08,100
requests that I was getting from them so

465
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:11,010
Kath helped me pivot to a new strategy

466
00:24:11,010 --> 00:24:13,920
where I only applied to companies where

467
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:16,560
I could get a referral from untrusted

468
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:19,260
underrepresented person in tech I've met

469
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:22,710
in real life from Twitter or we all

470
00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:27,000
jeaious or again an ally from that is

471
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,220
trusted from any of those communities so

472
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:32,910
this shift in job searching was also in

473
00:24:32,910 --> 00:24:34,890
hopes to try and filter out a lot of

474
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:37,310
horrible technical interviewing

475
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:44,800
experiences I was already accustomed to

476
00:24:44,810 --> 00:24:48,320
so I argue that the most important facet

477
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:52,970
of mentorship is sponsorship effective

478
00:24:52,970 --> 00:24:54,770
mentorship cannot happen without

479
00:24:54,770 --> 00:24:58,190
sponsorship mentors should use their

480
00:24:58,190 --> 00:24:59,960
privilege and network to open

481
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:03,290
communities for their mentees so I was

482
00:25:03,290 --> 00:25:05,690
very lucky and Kat leveraged their

483
00:25:05,690 --> 00:25:08,030
connections within the package manager

484
00:25:08,030 --> 00:25:10,910
community and introduced me to on Jay

485
00:25:10,910 --> 00:25:14,510
Arco he is the CTO of Ruby together

486
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:17,240
which is a nonprofit that funds

487
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:20,920
development work for the Ruby ecosystem

488
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:26,510
specifically for rubygems and bundler so

489
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:29,390
Andre is lead developer for bundler

490
00:25:29,390 --> 00:25:32,360
which is the dependency manager gem for

491
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:36,170
the Ruby ecosystem so bundler is kind of

492
00:25:36,170 --> 00:25:44,030
like the Ruby NPM so thankfully NPM and

493
00:25:44,030 --> 00:25:47,630
bundler are good friends because of this

494
00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:50,630
friendship this friendship opened doors

495
00:25:50,630 --> 00:25:57,410
for my career so my experience is that

496
00:25:57,410 --> 00:25:59,750
really together were overwhelmingly

497
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:00,410
positive

498
00:26:00,410 --> 00:26:03,890
I was hired as a software engineer for

499
00:26:03,890 --> 00:26:06,890
Ruby together to maintain Butler here

500
00:26:06,890 --> 00:26:10,220
iTriage open github issues I answered

501
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:12,580
users questions I improved documentation

502
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:17,330
I translated documentation I added tests

503
00:26:17,330 --> 00:26:20,380
and then I also submitted PRS for bugs

504
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:23,510
so Andre was an invaluable mentor

505
00:26:23,510 --> 00:26:25,310
because he would clearly break down

506
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:27,530
challenging bundler concepts so I could

507
00:26:27,530 --> 00:26:31,520
understand them something else that was

508
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,440
like super interesting and helpful was a

509
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:36,290
and J also told me about Ruby history

510
00:26:36,290 --> 00:26:38,810
before I even started Ruby which is

511
00:26:38,810 --> 00:26:43,370
super valuable just for a context so at

512
00:26:43,370 --> 00:26:44,150
Ruby together

513
00:26:44,150 --> 00:26:47,810
I really dive deep into Ruby I learned

514
00:26:47,810 --> 00:26:50,030
methods and numerable x' that i never

515
00:26:50,030 --> 00:26:53,360
would have even have touched or seen if

516
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:56,160
I'd only ever written

517
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:58,960
so another really cool thing that I

518
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:01,240
learned at Ruby together was I learned

519
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:03,430
how to build and release gems to Ruby

520
00:27:03,430 --> 00:27:07,740
gems so I built a jam called gay of hi

521
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:11,430
so gay of Faiza gem that prepends

522
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:17,980
colorful queer emojis to your exceptions

523
00:27:17,990 --> 00:27:19,200
[Music]

524
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:26,130
excuse me technical difficulties okay so

525
00:27:26,130 --> 00:27:29,560
basically whenever you mess up in the

526
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:32,440
rails console for GFI you'll get like

527
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:35,260
really cute emojis to hopefully bring up

528
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:36,240
your day

529
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:41,050
so my work for bundler was very

530
00:27:41,050 --> 00:27:44,680
impressive to perspective employers you

531
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:48,070
know my full-time job search even after

532
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:50,080
working a few short months at Ruby

533
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:53,290
together was already much more fruitful

534
00:27:53,290 --> 00:27:55,750
I've no doubt in my mind that my

535
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:57,880
contributions to bundler helped me land

536
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:59,830
my current back-end software engineering

537
00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:02,950
position I found out that employers

538
00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:05,440
really value experience in the package

539
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:07,780
manager space and look highly upon

540
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:12,910
building and releasing gems so I would

541
00:28:12,910 --> 00:28:22,000
like to show you how KFI works so

542
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,150
basically this is a rails out you go to

543
00:28:25,150 --> 00:28:30,430
your gem file you put jfi in it go back

544
00:28:30,430 --> 00:28:32,140
to your terminal you bundle install

545
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:35,890
which is like NPM install it's all

546
00:28:35,890 --> 00:28:38,860
installed and then you can open up the

547
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:44,080
rails console play around and then yeah

548
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:46,660
when you mess up you'll get awesome

549
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:48,730
emojis so hopefully you'll make your dip

550
00:28:48,730 --> 00:28:52,570
agai debugging a little little happier a

551
00:28:52,570 --> 00:28:57,580
little better so yeah some rainbows some

552
00:28:57,580 --> 00:29:00,270
like kiss and like lipstick emojis

553
00:29:00,270 --> 00:29:04,030
Sparkle emojis so yeah that was really

554
00:29:04,030 --> 00:29:09,950
fun to build

555
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:14,259
so in spite of adversity the biases of

556
00:29:14,259 --> 00:29:17,320
interviewers the super time-consuming

557
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:20,289
coding Giles and the feelings of being

558
00:29:20,289 --> 00:29:23,080
other dand having to prove myself over

559
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:26,019
and over again in spite of all of that I

560
00:29:26,019 --> 00:29:29,320
am here so my career in tech as a

561
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:31,749
back-end software engineer has taken off

562
00:29:31,749 --> 00:29:35,230
now as I gained more and more privilege

563
00:29:35,230 --> 00:29:38,080
in tech and the more senior I become

564
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:41,739
I really hope to both mentor and sponsor

565
00:29:41,739 --> 00:29:44,289
underrepresented folks like myself

566
00:29:44,289 --> 00:29:47,259
trying to break into tech I want to

567
00:29:47,259 --> 00:29:49,629
bring underrepresented folks up with me

568
00:29:49,629 --> 00:29:52,869
as I rise I want to pay it forward so

569
00:29:52,869 --> 00:29:56,799
that other underrepresented folks become

570
00:29:56,799 --> 00:30:01,869
