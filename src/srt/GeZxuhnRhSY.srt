2
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:08,340
hi I'm Judy I'm a developer hi i'm fran

3
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:10,050
from a designer by the way how many

4
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:14,250
designers do we have today not a lot but

5
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:17,250
as expected as a mostly tech conference

6
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:19,770
but how many developers work with

7
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:25,890
designers so that's of us today and well

8
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:28,170
we're very excited to be here today and

9
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:31,230
spark to dev UX culture so what step UX

10
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:33,480
it's basically well the idea of

11
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:35,340
spreading the love between designers and

12
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:38,940
developers finally so just a bit about

13
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:42,210
myself so I'm a little developer at

14
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:45,390
theater it's a service company and what

15
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:47,250
I do is help my client build new

16
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:50,520
products so this whole story about dev

17
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:53,160
u8 started actually with the project so

18
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:56,370
a year ago I was on this project and I

19
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:58,770
have to build a chat service in six

20
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:02,280
months so the project starts and the

21
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:05,489
designer sends me all the mock-ups and

22
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:07,680
actually I get stuck at the first

23
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,140
feature because I have to display this

24
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:12,360
chat bubble but I don't have the icons

25
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:16,140
so I asked the designer for the icon and

26
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:18,570
he sent me this and actually I cannot

27
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:21,780
work with this blue background so I

28
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:25,470
asked for the icon on me and then we're

29
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:28,229
working on the remote so the designer is

30
00:01:28,229 --> 00:01:30,030
not there and I have to wait for the

31
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:32,369
icon and I just cannot just go there and

32
00:01:32,369 --> 00:01:34,470
poke him and say yeah give me the icon

33
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:37,950
please give me the icon so I wait and I

34
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:40,829
guess and I get this nice PNG but then I

35
00:01:40,829 --> 00:01:43,020
realize hey colors should be

36
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:44,909
customizable and actually I cannot do

37
00:01:44,909 --> 00:01:47,009
that with the PNG I I really would like

38
00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:49,829
an SVG format so I asked for an SVG

39
00:01:49,829 --> 00:01:53,060
format and I wait for the fight to come

40
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:56,130
so finally after all those back and

41
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:57,930
forth about the stupid icon and

42
00:01:57,930 --> 00:01:59,939
basically I wasted half a day on this

43
00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:03,380
well I finally get to finish my feature

44
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:06,180
so he must hear the frustration in my

45
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:07,860
voice when I tell this story but at that

46
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:09,569
time I had much more things to worry

47
00:02:09,569 --> 00:02:10,080
about

48
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:10,869
I had to

49
00:02:10,869 --> 00:02:13,360
tends to pack ends to manage I had a

50
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,060
team to train so really when it comes to

51
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:18,310
markup integrations I didn't want it to

52
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:21,819
come that way and be so painful so then

53
00:02:21,819 --> 00:02:23,739
I took a step back and then I remembered

54
00:02:23,739 --> 00:02:27,069
that well I had a friend Hoss who has

55
00:02:27,069 --> 00:02:29,079
actually an experiment a designer and I

56
00:02:29,079 --> 00:02:30,970
wondered how she was working so I

57
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:32,590
reached out to her and asked for her

58
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:36,579
help and her insights so when she called

59
00:02:36,579 --> 00:02:38,379
me was actually pretty funny because I

60
00:02:38,379 --> 00:02:41,140
was suffering on my own project back

61
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:43,299
then I was working at a sister company

62
00:02:43,299 --> 00:02:45,609
of thedo and so I was working with a

63
00:02:45,609 --> 00:02:48,220
client and a very simple app it was a

64
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:50,440
mobile application with a very classic

65
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,700
sign up and login

66
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:55,930
so I gave the design for the signup form

67
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:57,730
to the developers who start working on

68
00:02:57,730 --> 00:03:00,370
it and then asked me for the login form

69
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:02,829
and I go why do you need it because

70
00:03:02,829 --> 00:03:05,349
they're actually the same design with

71
00:03:05,349 --> 00:03:08,049
different wordings but they insisted so

72
00:03:08,049 --> 00:03:10,150
I ended up providing it to them but I

73
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:11,859
was very frustrated because if you look

74
00:03:11,859 --> 00:03:13,599
at those design side by side they're the

75
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:15,370
same structure the basically the same

76
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:18,220
thing and it's just it felt like they

77
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:20,049
didn't try to understand a product as a

78
00:03:20,049 --> 00:03:22,720
whole and were just designing the pages

79
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:28,090
as he came and I was actually I had

80
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:29,799
other things to do I had a product owner

81
00:03:29,799 --> 00:03:31,690
who didn't want you to usability testing

82
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:33,340
so I was trying very hard to convince

83
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:34,989
him that that was very important to do

84
00:03:34,989 --> 00:03:38,620
and a very short timeline to design the

85
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:42,370
rest of the features of the app so I'm

86
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:46,389
having to copy paste the same design and

87
00:03:46,389 --> 00:03:47,919
then changing the wording was that the

88
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:52,060
last thing I wanted to do so having

89
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:54,250
heard each side of the story we realized

90
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:56,889
that by under sting understanding each

91
00:03:56,889 --> 00:03:59,169
other more we would actually enjoy

92
00:03:59,169 --> 00:04:01,239
working together and that's how we

93
00:04:01,239 --> 00:04:04,000
started this whole Devi web thing and so

94
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,609
we experimented on new projects we've

95
00:04:06,609 --> 00:04:08,859
worked with other teams and we were able

96
00:04:08,859 --> 00:04:11,079
to map out four levels of dev UX

97
00:04:11,079 --> 00:04:13,000
collaborations so I'm going to work

98
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,099
through them

99
00:04:14,099 --> 00:04:16,590
grunts you're obviously STIs function

100
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:18,690
then you can move up to level one the

101
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:21,810
basics then level two efficiency and

102
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:25,500
finally the Holy Grail symbiosis so what

103
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:26,880
we're going to do is walk you through

104
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,770
different projects at different stages

105
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:30,840
of collaboration to illustrate our

106
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:33,990
points and before that just a summarize

107
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:36,720
of the context so the usual team

108
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,210
composition of the project would be the

109
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:41,009
product team with designers and

110
00:04:41,009 --> 00:04:43,110
developers working hand-in-hand with a

111
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:45,060
product owner that sets the product

112
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:47,520
vision and the roadmap around this team

113
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,460
we have stakeholders such as the CEO of

114
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:52,620
someone from marketing someone from

115
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:54,900
another product team or even legal

116
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:56,490
that's gonna tell you yeah I need this

117
00:04:56,490 --> 00:05:01,470
or that so for the first story by the

118
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:03,479
way all stories are true for the first

119
00:05:03,479 --> 00:05:05,130
time I'm going to take a food tech app

120
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:07,199
that my company worked on a couple of

121
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:10,410
years back I didn't work on the project

122
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:11,849
we're actually working with a freelance

123
00:05:11,849 --> 00:05:13,860
designer who had a very limited time on

124
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:16,050
the project but I did follow the project

125
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:19,349
very closely and so it started like this

126
00:05:19,349 --> 00:05:21,990
the designer had time in advance to ship

127
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:25,199
all of the design for the product so he

128
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,449
provides that to the team and the

129
00:05:27,449 --> 00:05:28,979
product owner is very happy because

130
00:05:28,979 --> 00:05:31,530
that's exactly what she wanted so the

131
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:35,820
team happily starts and actually one

132
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:38,580
week later the CEO sees the app and he

133
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:40,440
is very unhappy with the UI he says

134
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,270
that's totally not what he wanted for

135
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:44,580
the app and actually that puts a stop to

136
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:47,039
everything the team has to start over on

137
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:49,050
the design and the development team has

138
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:51,150
no choice but to only work on the

139
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:53,599
backend for a while and it took

140
00:05:53,599 --> 00:05:57,930
literally three weeks and 17 attempts to

141
00:05:57,930 --> 00:06:00,659
find a UI design that actually worked

142
00:06:00,659 --> 00:06:06,130
for both the PIO and the nd CEO and

143
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:07,900
from then development can start again

144
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:10,210
but that's when the designer had to

145
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:11,830
leave because he only had that much time

146
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:15,190
on the project and that's in theory if

147
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:18,640
all the designs are great great but of

148
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:20,110
course there were things that were

149
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:21,970
missing there were behaviors that were

150
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:24,340
not clear and so the developers they

151
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:25,540
have no one to turn to except the

152
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:27,430
product owner so they asked her for

153
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:29,500
advice and she goes well I'm not a

154
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,720
designer so I really don't know so they

155
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,700
do what they can and then we call this

156
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:36,430
best effort which means they try to do

157
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:39,070
something that not too ugly and Kanna

158
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:41,080
works and let's hope nothing breaks

159
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:45,070
and so yeah so let's look back and see

160
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:48,340
what went wrong so first thing the CEO

161
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:51,070
made the whole team start over and this

162
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:53,230
happens when the process for product

163
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:55,090
definition is not clear so this happens

164
00:06:55,090 --> 00:06:57,970
mostly with macaws being late too many

165
00:06:57,970 --> 00:06:59,560
people being involved in the decision

166
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:02,080
process there's other problems that can

167
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,250
happen too

168
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:05,230
like for example the vision of the

169
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:07,240
product is not well defined so it's very

170
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:10,210
important at this very basic level to

171
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:12,700
clarify what each team member has to do

172
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:14,710
what their responsibility is and to

173
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:16,060
define key moments where they can

174
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:17,800
synchronize with each other so a very

175
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:21,040
simple very basic process would be the

176
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:24,310
product owner is the one who is in

177
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:26,190
charge of the product vision so he

178
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:28,900
writes down the specifications and the

179
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:31,120
description of the task description he

180
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,490
has dedicated moment with the designer

181
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:36,040
so that he can pass on that vision so

182
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,510
that the designer can make the mock-ups

183
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:39,280
and there's a separate moment for

184
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,620
developers you altogether define the

185
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:44,320
technical strategy to implement all this

186
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:47,260
so of course this is a very simple way

187
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:49,630
of doing it but don't be afraid of

188
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:52,030
adapting this to your context for

189
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:53,440
example if you know that your product

190
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:57,340
owner wants or likes to have user inputs

191
00:07:57,340 --> 00:07:59,860
before he decides of the needs bring him

192
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:03,040
into your user research if you know that

193
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:05,800
developers can be very picky about

194
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:08,470
certain things in the design invite them

195
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:10,510
to the UX workshop so that they can

196
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:13,330
together you can find solutions for the

197
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:14,020
upcoming

198
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:17,139
juice etc etc and it might look a bit

199
00:08:17,139 --> 00:08:18,789
scary like this because it looks like

200
00:08:18,789 --> 00:08:20,319
they're all those big meetings but they

201
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:22,150
don't have to be big meetings you can do

202
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:22,479
this

203
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:25,780
a synchronously over slag or on any tool

204
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:28,180
that you use you can do that over a

205
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:30,220
coffee break five minutes the important

206
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:32,169
thing is just to update every member of

207
00:08:32,169 --> 00:08:34,680
the team product design product owner

208
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:38,110
all together on what is the new

209
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:42,459
direction for the product so what's the

210
00:08:42,459 --> 00:08:45,329
second issue the second issue is that

211
00:08:45,329 --> 00:08:48,220
actually the there were missing assets

212
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:51,220
and that happens a lot when designers do

213
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:53,410
their job ship the designs and they just

214
00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:55,930
leave and the thing that don't worry

215
00:08:55,930 --> 00:08:57,910
they don't realize is that mock-ups are

216
00:08:57,910 --> 00:09:01,570
not development reading material so what

217
00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:03,760
I really encourage people to do is to

218
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,339
have a meeting developers and designers

219
00:09:06,339 --> 00:09:08,290
together to define what needs to be

220
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:11,290
delivered alongside the mock-ups and to

221
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:13,720
centralize those the assets and

222
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:16,120
everything in the design house so first

223
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:18,250
you could just for example it could just

224
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:20,200
be a simple checklist of everything that

225
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,850
needs to be done it may be its static

226
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:23,709
content maybe it's images where can I

227
00:09:23,709 --> 00:09:27,040
find those images etc a very useful tool

228
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,990
is to use the design hand off tool

229
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:30,820
because they centralize everything you

230
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:33,100
can download the asset but you also can

231
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:35,470
see how the screen was built so that you

232
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:37,480
see the margins the font size the font

233
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,670
colors you can even export some code

234
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:45,480
when depending on the under product and

235
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:49,060
yeah my personal favorite is is the

236
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:51,550
plane but there's a lot of tools on the

237
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:54,070
market so we can talk about it later if

238
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:56,190
you want

239
00:09:56,190 --> 00:09:58,950
and the third thing is that because the

240
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:00,930
designer had left the developers were

241
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:02,340
left on their own to figure out some

242
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:06,390
behaviors and solutions and this this is

243
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:08,190
again is because the designer had to

244
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:10,530
leave before the end of the project what

245
00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:12,720
we really encourage you to do is to find

246
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,970
a way to keep the designer working in

247
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:17,280
parallel of the developers for instance

248
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:19,710
I always manage to during a certain

249
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:22,470
sprint help the developers with the

250
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:23,550
current feature they're working on

251
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:25,020
because since I worked on the feature

252
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:27,750
beforehand I can help them with certain

253
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:29,610
issues certain things that we hadn't

254
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:33,330
seen upfront but I can also test the

255
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:35,010
previous features so they can learn from

256
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:38,220
them and avoid some mistakes in the

257
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,870
future and I can start thinking about

258
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:42,390
the upcoming features and if the

259
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:44,550
roadmaps of designers and developers are

260
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:46,560
well synchronized then it's completely

261
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:50,160
possible to do this so if I want to

262
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:53,700
summarize if you cut the design and

263
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:55,440
development process in three phases

264
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,570
product the finish definition mock-up

265
00:10:57,570 --> 00:11:00,690
delivery and development the product

266
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:02,940
definition phase four to go to the basic

267
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:04,920
level of collaboration you need to have

268
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:07,590
a well-defined process on the mock-up

269
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:08,070
delivery

270
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:10,350
it's important to centralize everything

271
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:12,210
so that developers know where to find

272
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:15,480
the information and the assets and on

273
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:18,270
the development side work together where

274
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:19,980
next to each other so it's easier to

275
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:23,160
communicate and not have moments where

276
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,930
you just don't know what to do and have

277
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:27,960
no one to answer to your questions if

278
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:30,000
you do all this then you got to level

279
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,920
one so welcome you've got the basics so

280
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:38,040
what happens now with level one project

281
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:42,390
so the team here is working on a travel

282
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:44,250
agency tool and what they're trying to

283
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:48,890
do is display an itinerary on the map

284
00:11:48,890 --> 00:11:53,330
this is the design that the designer

285
00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:57,030
suggests and the team implements it but

286
00:11:57,030 --> 00:12:00,390
actually when it goes live the itinerary

287
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:04,440
do not look very user friendly and that

288
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:07,079
happens on most itineraries so the team

289
00:12:07,079 --> 00:12:09,990
has to roll back the feature and the

290
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:12,990
designer has to work again on the new

291
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:16,860
design this time with numbers for each

292
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:18,060
please

293
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:21,120
I mean numbers for each day and the

294
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,800
place is that the traveler is going to

295
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:27,620
visit the thing is the designer did not

296
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:30,450
think of the case where itineraries loop

297
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:33,810
so developers get stuck when first a

298
00:12:33,810 --> 00:12:36,000
date will happen at the same place as

299
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,310
day five and they need to figure out

300
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:40,290
something to display that information

301
00:12:40,290 --> 00:12:43,290
and in the first the designer decides to

302
00:12:43,290 --> 00:12:45,240
use a tooltip to display that

303
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:49,070
information and then the developer

304
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:53,010
finished the development they implement

305
00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:56,250
the tooltip and well they decided to

306
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:59,459
improvise on the hover and active state

307
00:12:59,459 --> 00:13:01,529
of that tooltip because they really were

308
00:13:01,529 --> 00:13:03,600
eager to finish that feature and

309
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,000
actually I don't think the designer

310
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,010
really liked it but he went with it

311
00:13:08,010 --> 00:13:09,630
because they wanted to bring value to

312
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:14,760
the users as fast as possible so what

313
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,670
are the new challenges that arose here

314
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:20,040
well first of the designer did not use

315
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:23,100
real data to build their mock episode

316
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:25,949
they were not really working on real use

317
00:13:25,949 --> 00:13:30,930
case and they did miss edge cases so to

318
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:33,390
provide that proven that it's essential

319
00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:35,610
that designers work with real data when

320
00:13:35,610 --> 00:13:39,420
it comes to like having complex

321
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:42,300
situations and developers can provide

322
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:44,459
those data and then can also provide

323
00:13:44,459 --> 00:13:46,980
technical insights during the mock-up

324
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:50,730
creation so for instance this is a tool

325
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:53,970
that house uses on sketch so it's it's

326
00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:56,190
called craft and what you can do is

327
00:13:56,190 --> 00:13:58,680
basically use an API to get some data

328
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:01,900
and use those data to populate a lists

329
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:05,230
so getting an image getting a title and

330
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:07,450
it's really powerful when you need to

331
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:10,029
populate for say a table or a list

332
00:14:10,029 --> 00:14:11,620
because we all know there are many

333
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:14,320
educators and it's good to work with

334
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:19,390
real data the second thing that was

335
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:22,540
missing was really a list of the states

336
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:26,460
and edge cases on components and

337
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:28,660
sometimes what can also miss it within

338
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:30,850
when it comes to responsive you don't

339
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:32,529
know how at the screen behaves and the

340
00:14:32,529 --> 00:14:36,640
layout behaves so really important to

341
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:39,460
have a style guide that some of all the

342
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:42,160
states and behaviors of components and

343
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:45,430
also define the break points for your

344
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:49,589
responsive behavior so we've mentioned I

345
00:14:49,589 --> 00:14:52,540
mean it was mentioned in the previous

346
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:56,680
talks do you have like a common language

347
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:59,350
between designers and developers and

348
00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:01,120
that's why I really like the style guide

349
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,550
it's really a UI contract between the

350
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:06,580
two and so you know what colors should

351
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:10,120
be used on the app you know what font

352
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:13,420
size what font you should use you know

353
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:15,820
the convention around margins and

354
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:17,920
spacings that should always be multiple

355
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:22,000
of some values you know like how the

356
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,130
patterns should behave you've got all

357
00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:28,080
the states and you've got the form

358
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:31,510
different variations of forms errors

359
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:35,140
States etc so I don't know if you have

360
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:36,990
this on your project if you don't really

361
00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:40,240
try to get this as soon as possible

362
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,040
because that will help you in your

363
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:44,650
choices and to get an app consistent and

364
00:15:44,650 --> 00:15:46,959
also

365
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:49,399
another thing that's helpful is user

366
00:15:49,399 --> 00:15:52,579
flow what I like when I work on a

367
00:15:52,579 --> 00:15:54,589
complex feature is really to understand

368
00:15:54,589 --> 00:15:57,649
how you go from one screen to another so

369
00:15:57,649 --> 00:16:01,660
here we have video uploading work flow

370
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:05,089
so first you start with the uploading

371
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:06,949
page then you move to your processing

372
00:16:06,949 --> 00:16:10,040
page and finally if it's successful you

373
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:12,199
get a preview and if it's not you go

374
00:16:12,199 --> 00:16:15,199
back to the initial upload page with an

375
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:19,790
error message this is an example of how

376
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:21,949
the designer can show you how the

377
00:16:21,949 --> 00:16:22,639
layouts

378
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:27,130
behave on smaller and wider screens and

379
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:30,470
really the designer can provide all

380
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:32,750
these but it's essential that developers

381
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:34,970
are unloaded on this and really

382
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:37,250
understand how to use style guides or

383
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:40,009
layout etc otherwise you'll just keep

384
00:16:40,009 --> 00:16:43,190
asking questions to the designer or just

385
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:45,860
not follow the rules and and the app

386
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:47,389
will not look like what the designer

387
00:16:47,389 --> 00:16:52,670
intended so to summarize for product

388
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:54,439
definition it's essential that the

389
00:16:54,439 --> 00:16:57,019
designer has real data and can work on

390
00:16:57,019 --> 00:16:59,709
the different edge cases and for that

391
00:16:59,709 --> 00:17:01,550
developers can provide technical

392
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:04,370
insights and for mock-up creation and

393
00:17:04,370 --> 00:17:06,020
development it's essential that

394
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:08,480
designers and developers speak the same

395
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,250
language and you can define that

396
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:14,179
contract with a style guide and if

397
00:17:14,179 --> 00:17:15,860
you've done all that in congratulations

398
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:17,900
you're you're reaching the level -

399
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:20,409
you're being efficient already you've

400
00:17:20,409 --> 00:17:23,630
you've got rid of most of the friction

401
00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:25,880
points so it's quite an achievement when

402
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:28,970
you're there and things get well happier

403
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:31,669
so you could just stop there but

404
00:17:31,669 --> 00:17:33,860
sometimes projects are more demanding

405
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:36,669
and you need to level up your game

406
00:17:36,669 --> 00:17:39,740
so let's see how you can go from a level

407
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:42,590
2 project where everything runs pretty

408
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:45,830
smoothly - and a new battery this is

409
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:47,330
actually a project that yielding and I

410
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:50,240
worked together on and we were working

411
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,850
for a product owner who was one very

412
00:17:52,850 --> 00:17:55,520
picky about the user experience and he

413
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:58,200
was right he was a market leader

414
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,509
afford to have bad user experience on

415
00:18:00,509 --> 00:18:03,149
his tool and the tool was a technical

416
00:18:03,149 --> 00:18:06,509
tool was for death plotters and in this

417
00:18:06,509 --> 00:18:07,830
tool there was a very lengthy

418
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:10,499
documentation as you can imagine and so

419
00:18:10,499 --> 00:18:14,100
I wanted that when you scroll down the

420
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:17,369
documentation you can see the anchor in

421
00:18:17,369 --> 00:18:19,859
the navigation on the left update so

422
00:18:19,859 --> 00:18:22,109
that you always know where you're at

423
00:18:22,109 --> 00:18:24,239
and you can easily come back to a point

424
00:18:24,239 --> 00:18:27,330
that you've missed previously and of

425
00:18:27,330 --> 00:18:29,009
course the product owner was completely

426
00:18:29,009 --> 00:18:31,230
on board with this idea except that your

427
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:33,239
link tells me well I'm sorry but it's

428
00:18:33,239 --> 00:18:35,190
too complex and we cannot fit it in a

429
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:37,950
roadmap right now so the product owner

430
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,809
is pretty disappointed but he

431
00:18:39,809 --> 00:18:41,639
understands and he goes along with it

432
00:18:41,639 --> 00:18:46,769
and I try very hard not to cry and as I

433
00:18:46,769 --> 00:18:48,629
said the product owner was very picky so

434
00:18:48,629 --> 00:18:50,399
he would always make us change tiny

435
00:18:50,399 --> 00:18:52,190
things here and there in the interface

436
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:55,859
if things were small and not quite right

437
00:18:55,859 --> 00:18:57,929
with fixit's spacing was not right with

438
00:18:57,929 --> 00:18:59,340
fix it

439
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:01,499
alignment was not right with fix it

440
00:19:01,499 --> 00:19:03,749
colors were not right I'd find a new

441
00:19:03,749 --> 00:19:06,600
color and then we'd implement it and as

442
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:09,139
you can see we were a team that was very

443
00:19:09,139 --> 00:19:12,869
we would pretty fast in answering and we

444
00:19:12,869 --> 00:19:15,299
were very efficient working together but

445
00:19:15,299 --> 00:19:17,279
there were still some friction points

446
00:19:17,279 --> 00:19:21,029
and we could do better so how can we do

447
00:19:21,029 --> 00:19:24,299
better the first thing you'll notice is

448
00:19:24,299 --> 00:19:26,549
that some cool features got shut down

449
00:19:26,549 --> 00:19:31,590
because of complexity and this actually

450
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:35,100
is happened because I didn't involve

451
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:37,320
your link beforehand before going to the

452
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:39,330
product owner and giving my suggestions

453
00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:41,279
what I should have done is sit down with

454
00:19:41,279 --> 00:19:43,049
her say okay I want to do this I think

455
00:19:43,049 --> 00:19:44,669
it would be a great addition to the

456
00:19:44,669 --> 00:19:46,259
product what do you think can we do this

457
00:19:46,259 --> 00:19:48,600
and this way we could have found a smart

458
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:52,080
solution together instead of then going

459
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,580
to the product owner then going through

460
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:55,200
her and having to shut it down and

461
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,299
making everyone very disappointed and

462
00:19:57,299 --> 00:19:59,759
wasting everyone's time actually I want

463
00:19:59,759 --> 00:20:01,019
to give you an example on another

464
00:20:01,019 --> 00:20:02,800
product

465
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,570
of where this happened and it was very

466
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:09,720
efficient there was this pricing range

467
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:15,070
that's called cider and so when the

468
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:17,200
development started they realized that

469
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,990
when it's very together you cannot read

470
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:22,930
the prices at all and so the rubber came

471
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:24,580
to me and said okay what do we do now

472
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:26,830
and I said oh but I actually wanted it

473
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:28,840
to look like that and he looked at me

474
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:30,910
and he said okay so we have this pretty

475
00:20:30,910 --> 00:20:32,440
long form and you want me to spend

476
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:35,230
however long on this I mean can't we

477
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:37,900
find something that's easier to do and

478
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:41,650
so we it took two minutes literally on

479
00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:43,600
my desk and we just said okay what's

480
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,640
important the important part is not to

481
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:49,360
at that point when the two ranges are

482
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:50,860
very close it's not you have both

483
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:54,370
numbers visible users are probably going

484
00:20:54,370 --> 00:20:56,760
to slide so if one of the numbers is

485
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:59,410
legible it should probably be enough at

486
00:20:59,410 --> 00:21:01,750
least for the first for the MVP and so

487
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:03,940
we added a white background behind the

488
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:05,440
first number so that you would always be

489
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:08,080
legible so in retrospect this was

490
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,300
probably not the best solution design or

491
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:13,510
UX wise but the message here is that we

492
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:15,670
spend two minutes together and we found

493
00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:17,320
a solution that we were both happy with

494
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:19,180
and that's what I really want to

495
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:23,730
emphasize on

496
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:26,360
the second thing is that there were lots

497
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:28,130
of back-and-forth in order to improve

498
00:21:28,130 --> 00:21:31,399
and polish the app and those were every

499
00:21:31,399 --> 00:21:33,470
time the they would it would be much but

500
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:35,299
they would accumulate and become small

501
00:21:35,299 --> 00:21:38,809
delays and so what we ended up doing at

502
00:21:38,809 --> 00:21:41,000
the end of the project was every week

503
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,309
Yelena and I would just sit down and go

504
00:21:43,309 --> 00:21:45,200
through all over the app for one hour

505
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,330
and we together we would find the little

506
00:21:47,330 --> 00:21:48,950
inconsistencies that do things that need

507
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:50,539
to be improved and polish the app

508
00:21:50,539 --> 00:21:51,980
together so we would basically per

509
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:54,529
program and this worked well but also

510
00:21:54,529 --> 00:21:57,620
something that works very well if if

511
00:21:57,620 --> 00:21:59,330
designers and developers share common

512
00:21:59,330 --> 00:22:01,789
design patterns so by that what I mean

513
00:22:01,789 --> 00:22:03,830
basically speak the same language but

514
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:05,389
beyond speaking the same language

515
00:22:05,389 --> 00:22:08,630
understand a bit the logic of each other

516
00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:11,360
each other's logic for example if I have

517
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:14,330
a team that understands some basics of

518
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:16,309
UX if I tell them I want the designs to

519
00:22:16,309 --> 00:22:18,620
be keyboard aware then they will know

520
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:21,230
that whenever a ship we talk about a

521
00:22:21,230 --> 00:22:23,269
form the buttons needs to be pushed up

522
00:22:23,269 --> 00:22:25,460
by the keyboard whenever someone's going

523
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:27,440
to type and I don't want do not have to

524
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,960
redesign every time the state where the

525
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:31,880
buttons are below and then the buttons

526
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:34,490
are pushed up because we understand each

527
00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:34,820
other

528
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:36,620
or on the other side on the other hand

529
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:39,139
if I have basis of understanding of HTML

530
00:22:39,139 --> 00:22:42,590
I know that well if for example in this

531
00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:45,440
example the this a table with two

532
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,899
columns I know that there's going to be

533
00:22:47,899 --> 00:22:49,639
a minimum space that I want to leave

534
00:22:49,639 --> 00:22:52,909
between the two columns I can show it to

535
00:22:52,909 --> 00:22:54,860
the designer through the design hand off

536
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:58,610
tool by putting the max width of the

537
00:22:58,610 --> 00:23:02,330
dump of a big give actually and so that

538
00:23:02,330 --> 00:23:03,950
the designer can inspect it a developer

539
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:05,840
can inspect it and doesn't need to come

540
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,850
to me and say okay so when it's long

541
00:23:07,850 --> 00:23:09,620
actually the text needs to wrap but I

542
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:11,659
don't know where and so this way it's

543
00:23:11,659 --> 00:23:15,019
much easier and much more efficient so

544
00:23:15,019 --> 00:23:18,200
this would be our advice you go from

545
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,570
level two to level three make sure to

546
00:23:20,570 --> 00:23:23,419
involve designers developers in the

547
00:23:23,419 --> 00:23:25,429
mock-up design process and find smart

548
00:23:25,429 --> 00:23:27,110
solutions together whenever you find

549
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:29,600
small small problems make sure you

550
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:32,690
understand and share the same design

551
00:23:32,690 --> 00:23:35,450
patterns so that you do not always need

552
00:23:35,450 --> 00:23:36,640
to be

553
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:40,270
asking questions and have moments where

554
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:42,790
you sit down together and improve the

555
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:44,620
app together as a team because that's

556
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:47,350
your common goal is to produce the best

557
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:50,770
product for your users and if you do

558
00:23:50,770 --> 00:23:52,810
that then you're amazing and welcome to

559
00:23:52,810 --> 00:23:56,620
the Volturi so now that you understand

560
00:23:56,620 --> 00:23:58,360
all about the different levels of

561
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:00,160
defects collaboration how can you

562
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:02,350
actually spark this new culture within

563
00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:06,130
your teams well first thing of just

564
00:24:06,130 --> 00:24:08,110
define where you're standing now and

565
00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:10,150
where you want to go if you have very

566
00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:12,790
solute situation if you just don't get

567
00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:16,630
along just sticks stick to the basics if

568
00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:19,720
you have lots of delays lots of

569
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:23,490
back-and-forth a focus on efficiency and

570
00:24:23,490 --> 00:24:26,860
finally if you have high UX expectations

571
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:29,710
or if you just want to have fun then aim

572
00:24:29,710 --> 00:24:31,750
for the same disease so basically this

573
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:34,000
summarize the different levels of def

574
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,520
rave def ux collaboration that you can

575
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:39,220
reach but the most important message

576
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:41,350
that we have for you is that dev UX is

577
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:43,780
all about the mindset so you need to

578
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:46,270
think as a team and act like a team

579
00:24:46,270 --> 00:24:48,760
player when is the last time that you

580
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:50,830
had lunch or had a beer with the whole

581
00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:53,500
team with your designers and and just

582
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:56,380
chat because those team-building moments

583
00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:58,360
are essential to build empathy and

584
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:00,550
understand each other's problems and

585
00:25:00,550 --> 00:25:05,530
motivations so much for instance my

586
00:25:05,530 --> 00:25:07,690
message to the developers here in this

587
00:25:07,690 --> 00:25:10,660
room is really that designers cannot

588
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:12,340
guess what you need to work properly so

589
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:16,870
don't hesitate to ask them and well do

590
00:25:16,870 --> 00:25:18,760
not hesitate to call the designer

591
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:20,380
whenever whenever you have a design

592
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:22,060
question because they will save you time

593
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:25,510
they used to solving those issues second

594
00:25:25,510 --> 00:25:28,300
thing to keep in mind is that details

595
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:29,620
are here for a reason

596
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:31,750
so you can rely on something like a

597
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:34,090
style guide or the design system to know

598
00:25:34,090 --> 00:25:36,730
the truth of what the app is going to

599
00:25:36,730 --> 00:25:38,560
look like so whenever you have a doubt

600
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:41,290
on colors on phantom sizes just refer to

601
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:43,870
that and pay attention because the

602
00:25:43,870 --> 00:25:45,930
designer has like take

603
00:25:45,930 --> 00:25:49,200
taken the effort to well provide you the

604
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:53,430
information so really use it and finally

605
00:25:53,430 --> 00:25:55,530
if you want to make your job more

606
00:25:55,530 --> 00:25:57,300
interesting show that you care about the

607
00:25:57,300 --> 00:26:00,840
product so that's the product owner and

608
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:03,120
the designer will involve you when

609
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:07,350
you're making decisions on the other

610
00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:09,900
side what the mindset I'd like to share

611
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:11,220
the mindset I'd like to share with

612
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:13,710
designers is first of all that mock-ups

613
00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:15,690
are not development relief material so

614
00:26:15,690 --> 00:26:18,930
you will need to provide extra steps for

615
00:26:18,930 --> 00:26:21,210
the developers to to work and so as I'm

616
00:26:21,210 --> 00:26:24,000
watching what they need another thing

617
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,950
that I've learned is that developers are

618
00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:28,800
amazing at finding errors and edge cases

619
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,900
and so it's so much easier when I evolve

620
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:34,770
them early on on on the design process

621
00:26:34,770 --> 00:26:37,980
so they can tell me well this what what

622
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:39,480
is going to happen when this error

623
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:41,160
happens and I'm like oh are we gonna

624
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:43,680
have this error yes believe me this is

625
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:45,090
my experience of course we're gonna have

626
00:26:45,090 --> 00:26:47,070
it so it's it's so much easier when

627
00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:48,750
they're in the room with me to discuss

628
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:52,380
those points but beyond that it's beyond

629
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:56,220
the smaller component edge cases we

630
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:58,020
often get frustrated when we come up

631
00:26:58,020 --> 00:26:59,760
with a nice design and want it to be

632
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,620
implemented and tell us well no sorry

633
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:04,230
it's too complex but actually what I've

634
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:06,870
learned is also very frustrating for the

635
00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:08,400
developer to not be able to do it

636
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,560
because they do care about the product

637
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:11,940
that I want it to be the best possible

638
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:14,340
so to avoid everyone's frustration just

639
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:17,040
involve the developer all the time

640
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:19,080
during the process because that's how

641
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:22,430
you can now come up with better features

642
00:27:22,430 --> 00:27:26,400
to in order to share the dev you access

643
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:28,400
period around us

644
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:30,960
yelling and I have been doing this

645
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:35,340
monthly Deborah wax drinks with people

646
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:39,120
around us and it's they're very the idea

647
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,280
is just to chill and talk about what

648
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:43,500
we're watching on Netflix what we

649
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:46,320
excited about in the next tools that are

650
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,360
coming out for example recently I shared

651
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:51,600
a lot about sketch 55:58 which i think

652
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,370
is going to change a lot of things on

653
00:27:53,370 --> 00:27:56,550
the design side of the project

654
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:59,880
and it's great because you can discuss

655
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:01,650
in a very informal way about your

656
00:28:01,650 --> 00:28:04,740
problems about what how you feel as a as

657
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:06,990
a person in a team that might be working

658
00:28:06,990 --> 00:28:10,679
well or might not for example in stencil

659
00:28:10,679 --> 00:28:12,960
and recently not actually I learned

660
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,200
during the first of these drinks is that

661
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,340
actually even though there's friction

662
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:18,990
sometimes between developers and

663
00:28:18,990 --> 00:28:21,090
designers developers are always so much

664
00:28:21,090 --> 00:28:23,130
happier when they work with designers

665
00:28:23,130 --> 00:28:25,620
because in the end at the end of the day

666
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:27,450
they're just prouder of the product that

667
00:28:27,450 --> 00:28:29,760
they're making and that was meant so

668
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:33,120
much to me yeah I I really like those

669
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,770
drinks - I mean wine and cheese like

670
00:28:34,770 --> 00:28:37,800
what what's more serious and more

671
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:40,260
seriously like there's something that I

672
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:42,300
learned and that was surprising to me

673
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:45,480
and actually I felt very relieved to

674
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:48,300
learn that is that designers are happy

675
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:50,309
to work with developers because they

676
00:28:50,309 --> 00:28:53,760
help them make their more make them more

677
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:56,400
thorough with their work and and that's

678
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,110
a relief for me because before that I

679
00:28:58,110 --> 00:28:59,790
only thought I was being annoying with

680
00:28:59,790 --> 00:29:03,360
all those requests and questions so I

681
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:06,390
think that's our message here if you

682
00:29:06,390 --> 00:29:08,460
