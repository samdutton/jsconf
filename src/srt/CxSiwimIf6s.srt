1
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:41,070

thank you yeah I'm just glad to be here

2
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:43,060
all right it's getting towards the end

3
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:45,490
of the day so I thought I'd start my

4
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:48,640
presentation with some questions also to

5
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,620
help me do some research as I formulate

6
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:52,060
the rest of the presentation in my head

7
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:55,780
so who here is a JavaScript developer is

8
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:58,239
your hands alright great so I'm in the

9
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:02,340
right place okay who here works as a

10
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:05,530
developer on a team with more than five

11
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:10,990
developers on it all right now keep your

12
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:14,320
hands up if you work on a team between

13
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:18,729
five and thirty developers awesome just

14
00:01:18,729 --> 00:01:20,830
give me a moment I you are all the

15
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:22,210
people that I want to talk to you after

16
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:25,270
this because my talk is actually about

17
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:28,060
engineers as makers and this is

18
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:32,830
something that comes out of my current

19
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:35,110
role which is VP of engineering at

20
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:38,020
social tables or DC based event planning

21
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:41,350
software company and we have five

22
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:44,530
developers now just about to be six and

23
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:46,090
so something that I'm thinking about a

24
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:49,570
lot as a first-time engineering manager

25
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:54,010
is how to how to best use these talented

26
00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:56,680
people on my team and to continue to

27
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,840
grow and build that so a little bit

28
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:01,180
about me I'm a self-taught programmer I

29
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:02,619
put that in quotes because so many

30
00:02:02,619 --> 00:02:04,060
people have helped me along the way as

31
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:07,119
mentors as as peers learning alongside

32
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:08,739
with me but that's what people say about

33
00:02:08,739 --> 00:02:10,060
themselves is that they're self-taught

34
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:14,230
so I just put that there and a little

35
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:15,370
bit of color for this presentation

36
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:17,110
I was actually a former business analyst

37
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:19,569
for client services firm so while right

38
00:02:19,569 --> 00:02:20,890
now I'm working on a product company

39
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:25,510
that does you know b2b sales I have set

40
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:27,940
in client offices before doing project

41
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:30,400
plans and project management and and

42
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,780
scoping so about this talk well it's

43
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:36,879
actually really simple it's about

44
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:40,000
getting from point A to point B and in

45
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,799
this particular case I'm going to define

46
00:02:41,799 --> 00:02:45,400
point a is just having people people are

47
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:48,489
your raw human resources the talent that

48
00:02:48,489 --> 00:02:52,390
will get you places so point B here is

49
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:55,030
product and we're all JavaScript

50
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:57,160
developers since you all raise your

51
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,420
hands and so products really here is

52
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:00,549
like software applications that people

53
00:03:00,549 --> 00:03:03,250
use and I'll just throw in a little bit

54
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:07,090
of a refinement on that so products that

55
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:09,159
other people actually want it's kind of

56
00:03:09,159 --> 00:03:10,540
a key piece especially if you're trying

57
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:15,430
to make money so very simply I just try

58
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:16,930
to break down products into the simplest

59
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:19,120
things that I know about them when I'm

60
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,380
trying to get to a point from point A to

61
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:24,269
point B and that's a design and code and

62
00:03:24,269 --> 00:03:26,530
what that really means is that we've got

63
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:29,500
designers and engineers and I'd like to

64
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:30,819
keep those separate I know there are

65
00:03:30,819 --> 00:03:32,109
people out there that you can do both

66
00:03:32,109 --> 00:03:34,569
engineering and designing I'm thinking

67
00:03:34,569 --> 00:03:36,849
that's like less than ten percent less

68
00:03:36,849 --> 00:03:38,290
than five percent of people really do

69
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:40,090
both those things so I person we go

70
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:41,230
ahead and assume that those are two

71
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:44,019
separate people in those places and then

72
00:03:44,019 --> 00:03:46,690
flushing out the other side you know

73
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:47,889
products that other people want well

74
00:03:47,889 --> 00:03:50,199
then we're talking about customers and

75
00:03:50,199 --> 00:03:51,519
keep that in mind because customers is

76
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:56,769
really important later on so you know

77
00:03:56,769 --> 00:03:58,120
these are some typical engineering

78
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,590
responsibilities I mean I pulled these

79
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:03,760
words off of like you know job pages you

80
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,190
see them all the time on you know

81
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:10,480
typically front-end back-end I most of

82
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,609
the time you know you're hired for one

83
00:04:12,609 --> 00:04:15,310
or two of those there's also testing QA

84
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:19,180
DevOps all sorts of specialties and then

85
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:21,340
you know in some companies you've got

86
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:23,199
one person doing all these other places

87
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:27,150
you've got a lot more specialization and

88
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:29,860
since when our JavaScript conference you

89
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:32,260
know we use node.js which i think is

90
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:33,940
amazing because automatically you can

91
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,530
have people do back in in front end

92
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:38,920
pretty easily I know there's caveat set

93
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,930
but really it's not that much of a

94
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:42,040
difference to take someone who just

95
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,570
knows client-side JavaScript well and

96
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:46,720
have them do server-side code so you

97
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,760
know for social tables it's really about

98
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:51,160
doing all these things and everyone

99
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:54,640
doing all these things well that seems

100
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,560
like a lot right but what if we added

101
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,060
all these other things that I've

102
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:00,400
highlighted in green project management

103
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,340
feature prioritization UI UX and new

104
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:06,160
product development well you think at

105
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,170
most places these are these are job

106
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:12,670
functions that other people do at social

107
00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:14,830
tables and other startups that I I think

108
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:17,200
might adopt this role there's a lot of

109
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,240
blending that happens and I think this

110
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,530
is kind of a philosophy that I've

111
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:22,210
adopted as I've been thinking more and

112
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:23,860
more about this that I really want to

113
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:26,110
preserve engineers as makers I really

114
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:27,790
want engineers to be thinking about the

115
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:29,470
problems that their customers are having

116
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:32,110
I really want to take engineers to think

117
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:34,600
very deeply about how to solve those

118
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:38,710
problems and owning it owning the whole

119
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:40,960
pipeline from kind of concept to

120
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:44,770
finished product of course there's a lot

121
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:47,050
of teamwork involved in that but that

122
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:50,980
leaves the question how so I think this

123
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:53,050
is the point where things get kind of

124
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:59,680
unclear well I believe it comes down

125
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,620
mostly to this a direct line to

126
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:05,890
customers so link between engineers and

127
00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:08,760
customers has to be strong it has to be

128
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:11,530
the engineer kind of understanding that

129
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:13,270
the problems of main of the customer and

130
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:14,170
kind of understanding where they're

131
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:15,640
coming from and again i'm coming i'm

132
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,290
talking about b2b sales but I hopefully

133
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:18,550
this applies that anyone who's working

134
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:20,530
at a services company or working at a

135
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:23,860
consumer product because your customer

136
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:27,060
is usually not you I'm sure the engineer

137
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:31,420
and so here's an example of what we've

138
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:33,670
done and we like to do is uh we actually

139
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:35,979
this is a picture of Romney here who's

140
00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:37,419
actually in the audience one of my

141
00:06:37,419 --> 00:06:40,330
teammates so we actually go to industry

142
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:41,110
events

143
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:42,610
said we're an event planning company so

144
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:44,380
we got to go to lots of events where you

145
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:46,060
see our customers all the time and we

146
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:47,440
demo our product in front of them we use

147
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,200
our product with them and so here's a

148
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:53,500
picture of robbing a couple of our other

149
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:59,160
teammates just add an event mingling and

150
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,870
here's another one of my favorites it's

151
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:05,860
it's taking turns on customer support so

152
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:07,360
I know there's some people from ol arc

153
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:11,490
around here yeah I love a lark it's it's

154
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:15,070
always a it's either really funny but

155
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:17,080
it's well it's really funny to interact

156
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,280
with customers sometimes so I'm just

157
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:20,710
going to read this out so there's a

158
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:22,360
customer they just made a diagram and

159
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,400
social tables they open the PDF and

160
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,010
close it out on accident where did it go

161
00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:31,330
she he or she asks and then Jake on my

162
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:33,520
team says hi there the PDF is probably

163
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,870
still on your computer some sort of

164
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:38,080
downloads folder I see using google

165
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,610
chrome on windows could you hit ctrl J

166
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:41,860
for me and then the user says oh my god

167
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:45,010
it's there what a you know what an

168
00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:46,450
eye-opening experience to see that oh

169
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:49,270
these people you know aren't actually

170
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:51,190
that savvy with computers letta love

171
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:52,930
your products so you need to make sure

172
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:54,340
that you keep that in mind when you're

173
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:56,590
building something so thank you a lot

174
00:07:56,590 --> 00:07:59,610
for providing that like day to day

175
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:04,090
laughter and also making that line 22

176
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:06,760
customers so I'm sensing like a lot of

177
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,650
kind of like silence here i'm not sure

178
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:10,450
if it's me or if it's we content but i

179
00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:12,520
really think this is kind of a cool

180
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:15,130
place to stop for a second and just say

181
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:18,820
like and hopefully ask if anyone else

182
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:20,350
out there has any ideas about how

183
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:21,580
engineers have interacted with the

184
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:23,380
customers has anyone had like an example

185
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:35,490
of something they've seen before no one

186
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,700
just strike that on Twitter oh yeah

187
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:40,640
definitely yeah if they if they tweet at

188
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,890
you and they have a problem or anything

189
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:54,680
like that definitely

190
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:57,140
so YouTube videos and then they interact

191
00:08:57,140 --> 00:09:01,680
oh really wow so video response oh

192
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:08,970
that's great all right yeah so I think

193
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:10,860
there's there's plenty of things you can

194
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:14,250
do out there this is just a few but like

195
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:15,930
going to meet your customers in person

196
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:17,330
and training them on your product

197
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:20,420
reading industry blogs in books it's

198
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:23,460
it's a great way to kind of understand

199
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:26,270
where your customers are coming from

200
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:28,710
visiting them and ultimately it's really

201
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:29,880
just about building relationships with

202
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:34,080
them so I have a couple customers that

203
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,520
I've just talked to over the last couple

204
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,440
of years and continue to so whenever I

205
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,690
have an idea I just shoot them an email

206
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:41,340
and ask what do you think about this is

207
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:42,300
something that you actually have a

208
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:48,570
problem with and you know I talked about

209
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:50,100
some of the other things that that I

210
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:52,440
hope engineers will take some ownership

211
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,510
of and one of those I think that's

212
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:56,210
really important is project management

213
00:09:56,210 --> 00:09:59,940
so here's an example of a simple project

214
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:02,490
plan that someone on my team put

215
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:04,320
together for you know we do this every

216
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,120
once in a while for like bigger projects

217
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,260
it's like you know anything that's going

218
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:09,960
to take more than a few weeks and so

219
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:12,300
we've got you know things like yeah

220
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:14,310
stakeholders here so we've got our head

221
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:15,960
is just like talking to the customers

222
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,550
again directly I'm figuring out what

223
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:19,920
their needs are the reason why I think

224
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,900
project project management and having a

225
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:23,670
project plan done by an engineer is kind

226
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:26,450
of cool is because you can start

227
00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:28,920
actually going directly into user

228
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:32,400
stories and proposed architecture going

229
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,470
into sort of design considerations even

230
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:36,750
from like the front end point of view so

231
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:38,640
you know what what templating engine are

232
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,620
you going to use or what database tables

233
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:42,240
do you need these are things that the

234
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,280
engineer really knows best so why not

235
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:48,540
have them jump in and do that from from

236
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:53,480
the very beginning of the project I

237
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:56,430
talked before about engineers and

238
00:10:56,430 --> 00:11:00,080
designers and and I think this is where

239
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:02,460
like when you talk about user interface

240
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:04,320
and user experience which is kind of the

241
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,420
next thing that I think engineers can be

242
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:08,250
good at

243
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:11,160
I found that design needs visual design

244
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:14,730
needs tend to be very spiky over time so

245
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:17,250
when you are releasing a product you

246
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:20,310
have a lot of design needs you need to

247
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:22,380
have a lot of thought put it exactly how

248
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:25,170
it's going to look sort of get a good

249
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:27,600
baseline of aesthetic out there also

250
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,390
figure out some basic interactions like

251
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:33,390
drag and drop vs point click or keyboard

252
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:35,340
based interaction these are things where

253
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:37,290
designer really needs to spend a ton of

254
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:39,570
time and your design needs to spend a

255
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:41,940
ton of time between these major major

256
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:44,400
iterations and redesigns I think

257
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,710
engineers can go and come in and

258
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:48,990
actually come up with new features on

259
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:51,420
their own probably with conjunction of

260
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:54,330
the designer but this is something that

261
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:55,980
engineer's can pretty good at if they

262
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:57,450
pay attention to what they're doing very

263
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:59,970
closely so they can actually code the UI

264
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:02,580
of you know if it's just another

265
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:04,850
functionality another another button

266
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:08,250
that already has styling they can come

267
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:12,700
in and figure that out without much help

268
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:16,200
so I did say that I was going to talk

269
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:20,070
about some pitfalls and I think there

270
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:21,720
are really three ones that I can think

271
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:24,660
of number one how does it scale so i

272
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:27,000
said i'm part of an engineering team of

273
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,600
five people or startup is not that old

274
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:33,660
it's about 23 years old and has like 35

275
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:37,950
employees now that's not that big so how

276
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:40,200
are you going to take this model and

277
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:46,970
scale it out number two engineers are

278
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:49,740
ultimately responsible for executing and

279
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:51,750
building code so isn't this a lot to ask

280
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:54,270
for on top of that and number three what

281
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:55,320
if engineers just don't want to think

282
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:58,500
about these things so I'll try to answer

283
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,750
them and I actually this is something

284
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:03,000
that I'm going to say is a work in

285
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,680
progress and I'm learning as I go so

286
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:08,339
really would love to hear other people's

287
00:13:08,339 --> 00:13:11,370
thoughts afterwards but number one how

288
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:14,040
does it scale well it comes down to also

289
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,000
great communication I think

290
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,170
communication is one of the things that

291
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:19,380
I always look for for people that I'm

292
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:21,699
thinking about hiring on for the team

293
00:13:21,699 --> 00:13:25,269
because when you don't get to have that

294
00:13:25,269 --> 00:13:27,609
much direct interaction with the

295
00:13:27,609 --> 00:13:29,199
customer I think that's going to

296
00:13:29,199 --> 00:13:30,999
naturally happen over time it's going to

297
00:13:30,999 --> 00:13:33,639
get harder your best line of defense

298
00:13:33,639 --> 00:13:35,199
against that is having great

299
00:13:35,199 --> 00:13:36,850
relationships with the other departments

300
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:38,949
in your company so sales marketing

301
00:13:38,949 --> 00:13:41,290
customer support are the ways are you

302
00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:42,759
know and inside of our company are the

303
00:13:42,759 --> 00:13:44,949
ones that always have a direct line to

304
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:46,899
the customer in the industry so having

305
00:13:46,899 --> 00:13:48,579
great relationships with those

306
00:13:48,579 --> 00:13:51,669
departments is going to give you the

307
00:13:51,669 --> 00:13:54,069
ability to scale out that that direct

308
00:13:54,069 --> 00:13:59,949
line and another thing that I think this

309
00:13:59,949 --> 00:14:01,660
is actually kind of more standard to be

310
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:04,209
honest is is dividing my product lines

311
00:14:04,209 --> 00:14:06,819
or customer segments I chose this too I

312
00:14:06,819 --> 00:14:08,379
think there's other ways you can divide

313
00:14:08,379 --> 00:14:10,809
but the point is that you need to divide

314
00:14:10,809 --> 00:14:14,470
and having and have small teams and it's

315
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:16,839
something we're trying out now where we

316
00:14:16,839 --> 00:14:18,879
have product lines and we have lead

317
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:21,459
engineer taking on one of the big

318
00:14:21,459 --> 00:14:24,399
project projects and products coming out

319
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:26,379
and I think that's a good way to scale

320
00:14:26,379 --> 00:14:32,649
as well and then as far as isn't this a

321
00:14:32,649 --> 00:14:35,139
lot to ask for well yeah it is that's

322
00:14:35,139 --> 00:14:37,389
really my answer to that is that yes it

323
00:14:37,389 --> 00:14:40,480
is and that kind of just leads into

324
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:43,600
number three really so you know

325
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,879
engineers wanted to think about these

326
00:14:45,879 --> 00:14:47,739
things because they have to want to do

327
00:14:47,739 --> 00:14:51,489
it myself included it comes down to

328
00:14:51,489 --> 00:14:55,149
culture comes down to what you stand for

329
00:14:55,149 --> 00:14:57,999
as an engineering team and if you stand

330
00:14:57,999 --> 00:15:00,759
for people who want to make things who

331
00:15:00,759 --> 00:15:03,160
want to start projects from beginning to

332
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:05,279
end who want to conceptualize and build

333
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:07,449
those are the people that will do well

334
00:15:07,449 --> 00:15:09,519
in this kind of environment it's not

335
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:13,059
just taking orders from you know having

336
00:15:13,059 --> 00:15:16,989
a completely mocked up PSD and every

337
00:15:16,989 --> 00:15:19,629
little step along the way spelled out

338
00:15:19,629 --> 00:15:22,539
for you so you know our culture is about

339
00:15:22,539 --> 00:15:24,309
taking chances our culture is about

340
00:15:24,309 --> 00:15:27,009
failing fast and and stretching their

341
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:30,869
abilities and wanting to talk wanted to

342
00:15:30,869 --> 00:15:34,610
expand I guess what you'd call

343
00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:39,930
your typical day to day engineering role

344
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:42,680
so just quickly touching on what this

345
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:46,269
framework means for other functions I

346
00:15:46,269 --> 00:15:48,589
really believe that product managers

347
00:15:48,589 --> 00:15:52,130
designers dedicated QA in this

348
00:15:52,130 --> 00:15:53,990
environment actually have an even

349
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:58,370
greater potential to to be really high

350
00:15:58,370 --> 00:16:02,660
leverage added added teammates because

351
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:05,269
you know when you have engineers that

352
00:16:05,269 --> 00:16:08,120
can kind of help out think of help think

353
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:11,300
of product needs when you have engineers

354
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:13,640
that can help with UI UX you have

355
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,380
engineers that can test their own code

356
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:18,230
in each other's code it makes their jobs

357
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:20,269
more about adding value and business

358
00:16:20,269 --> 00:16:22,940
value and so you can probably have one

359
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:27,350
designer scale out to to you know work

360
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:33,780
on multiple product lines for example

361
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:36,140
and then I just have a flannel talk

362
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:37,070
because I've been talking basically

363
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:38,600
about engineers being really cross

364
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,880
functional and I see this kind of

365
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:44,829
happening down the road even now where

366
00:16:44,829 --> 00:16:47,060
where people can have room to be

367
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:48,769
cross-functional I think this is

368
00:16:48,769 --> 00:16:51,890
something that I will continue to be a

369
00:16:51,890 --> 00:16:55,329
trend I hope it's a trend and

370
00:16:55,329 --> 00:16:59,360
specifically with people who are not in

371
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:02,089
engineering roles learning to do basic

372
00:17:02,089 --> 00:17:04,040
engineering like well like

373
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:06,350
responsibilities I guess so some

374
00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:08,419
examples of this are sales people making

375
00:17:08,419 --> 00:17:10,490
like lead scoring algorithms you can do

376
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:11,780
this in Salesforce you can figure out

377
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:14,419
who you need to contact first that takes

378
00:17:14,419 --> 00:17:17,030
a basically I wouldn't really I don't

379
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:19,490
know if its coding per se but it's it's

380
00:17:19,490 --> 00:17:22,069
thinking in that way mark inators

381
00:17:22,069 --> 00:17:24,850
building pages and unbound this is saved

382
00:17:24,850 --> 00:17:28,250
my team so much time like whenever you

383
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:30,049
need a new page like it's just going to

384
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:31,910
look just like last page except it needs

385
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:34,040
new content so now we have all that

386
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:35,600
marketing stuff in unbound switch you

387
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,870
just smell it's just you swap it in and

388
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:40,940
you can change it however you want you

389
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:43,419
can a be test we don't have to touch it

390
00:17:43,419 --> 00:17:47,780
and it looks good designers can leverage

391
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:48,500
rapid

392
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,510
typing tools we've been doing this for

393
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:54,080
our latest mobile app where you can

394
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:58,340
actually see it work it's not you know

395
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:00,860
coated and I an objective-c it's not

396
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:03,830
coded in html5 it's just you clicked a

397
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:05,870
button and then the next screen unfolds

398
00:18:05,870 --> 00:18:07,550
and you really get a sense of how it's

399
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:11,090
going to work and then you know even

400
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:13,280
customer support these days on our team

401
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:17,180
in our company has the ability to to

402
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:21,230
send out automated surveys to be able to

403
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:23,540
code there HTML emails with surveys

404
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:25,610
built into them which i think is really

405
00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:28,760
great because you know it's them not

406
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:34,520
needing to rely on us once again so

407
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:37,730
that's really it for me I wanted to give

408
00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:39,170
this talk as more of a discussion

409
00:18:39,170 --> 00:18:41,030
starter so I would love to talk more

410
00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:42,860
especially those people who kept their

411
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:47,390
hands up so thank you thank you for

412
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:48,530
bearing with me and you know it's

413
00:18:48,530 --> 00:18:49,850
getting late I probably some of you

414
00:18:49,850 --> 00:18:52,190
