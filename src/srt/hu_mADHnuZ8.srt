00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:11,820
hi my name is Victoria I'm a front-end

4
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:13,769
developer and a chapter leader for

5
00:00:13,769 --> 00:00:16,350
something called view vixens view vixens

6
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:18,270
is an initiative that helps women and

7
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:20,100
those who identify as women learn view

8
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:22,199
jeaious in a supportive and inclusive

9
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:25,230
environment and I'm here to tell you my

10
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:27,359
story with the V vixens and what we do

11
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:31,650
to help other women so just so that you

12
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:35,100
know where I come from I started so

13
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:37,079
three and a half years ago I graduated

14
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:40,350
from University with a Bachelor of Arts

15
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:42,390
in Japanese and German and linguistic

16
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:46,140
studies and as I was holding my diploma

17
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:48,539
I realized and I was taking graduation

18
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:49,800
photos with my brother and my

19
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,469
grandmother I realized I have no

20
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:55,410
idea what to do next so I moved to

21
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:57,629
Germany and after trials and errors with

22
00:00:57,629 --> 00:01:00,199
design school and a master's degree I

23
00:01:00,199 --> 00:01:03,120
decided to embrace the challenge of

24
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:06,420
becoming a web developer but I realized

25
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:08,130
that if I wanted to become a web

26
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:10,250
developer I would be much better off

27
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:13,290
doing that as part of a community so I

28
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:16,799
started using Twitter again and joining

29
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:20,130
the developer community on Twitter fast

30
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:22,409
forward a year later I was able to get

31
00:01:22,409 --> 00:01:25,020
my first developer job and also was

32
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:26,340
granted the privilege of attending

33
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:30,479
conferences like this one I also became

34
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:33,090
more active on Twitter and as a result

35
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:36,150
of me using view at work I also joined

36
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:39,540
the view community on Twitter on Twitter

37
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:42,869
I also stumbled upon view vixens and I

38
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:45,149
didn't really know what they did all I

39
00:01:45,149 --> 00:01:46,590
knew was that there was helping women in

40
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:49,979
tech and they were awesome and there was

41
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:51,780
someone called Jenn looper and she's the

42
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:54,329
CEO of the view vixens and Natalia the

43
00:01:54,329 --> 00:01:58,469
CTO of V vixens a few months later I was

44
00:01:58,469 --> 00:02:01,439
able to attend vue.js London a community

45
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:03,060
conference and finally had my first

46
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:05,610
meeting with the view community there

47
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:08,520
natalia the CTO of u vixens had a talk

48
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:11,190
where she talked about all the things

49
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:12,849
that the view vixens

50
00:02:12,849 --> 00:02:16,930
in 2018 so a little bit more about the

51
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:19,390
Vixens community it was founded at

52
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:22,900
vue.js Amsterdam in 2018 and since then

53
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:26,370
we have done over 50 events worldwide

54
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:29,769
including workshops meetups and smaller

55
00:02:29,769 --> 00:02:31,569
conference Lex events where we help

56
00:02:31,569 --> 00:02:34,720
women build view applications or just

57
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,959
generally support them in any type of

58
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:40,420
developer or personal or professional

59
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:43,299
questions that they might have so I

60
00:02:43,299 --> 00:02:44,889
joined the view vixens as a chapter

61
00:02:44,889 --> 00:02:47,439
