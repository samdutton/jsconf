1
00:00:19,699 --> 00:00:20,699
Yes!

2
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:21,699
Hi!

3
00:00:21,699 --> 00:00:22,699
Welcome.

4
00:00:22,699 --> 00:00:23,699
So my name is Jan Jongboom.

5
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:24,699
I indeed live in the
Netherlands.

6
00:00:24,699 --> 00:00:29,820
It took me 14 hours on an airplane without
inflight entertainment

7
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:31,619
to get down here.

8
00:00:31,619 --> 00:00:34,530
So sacrifices, you know?

9
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:36,390
I work in Telenor, it's like AT&T.

10
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:43,480
We're a big Telco, and they pay me to work
on Open Source.

11
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:44,890
So yes.

12
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:47,729
Thank you.

13
00:00:47,729 --> 00:00:51,070
So in the past two and a half years, I've
been mostly working with Mozilla.

14
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:55,370
I've been a pair on the Firefox OS project,
we've launched phones in Eastern

15
00:00:55,370 --> 00:01:02,309
Europe and southeast Asia, and lately I've
been focusing my efforts on

16
00:01:02,309 --> 00:01:04,759
anything related with the real world.

17
00:01:04,759 --> 00:01:08,380
Internet of things, robots, yesterday I
even built a rocket.

18
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:09,380
Come on.

19
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:13,049
Yes, it went up extremely fast, and it went
down

20
00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:15,260
even faster.

21
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:17,200
But...

22
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,200
You know, like...

23
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:21,680
The fact that we're in this incredible ballroom
with

24
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:28,689
so many developers, that are all getting excited
by playing with bots, playing

25
00:01:28,689 --> 00:01:32,700
with rockets, playing with ships -- that excites
me, man.

26
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:33,700
Because...

27
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:36,479
It is one
of the best times to be in technology at this

28
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:37,479
moment.

29
00:01:37,479 --> 00:01:43,679
We are on the verge of a
new era.

30
00:01:43,679 --> 00:01:49,319
When I learned to program, like, in the '90s,
if you wrote an

31
00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:54,270
application, if you wrote a computer program,
it essentially meant that, like,

32
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:57,610
it's running in this confined box.

33
00:01:57,610 --> 00:02:02,049
If there's input getting into the computer,
you did it over your keyboard, and then when

34
00:02:02,049 --> 00:02:05,029
it came out, it came out of this.

35
00:02:05,029 --> 00:02:07,899
This is no longer the case.

36
00:02:07,899 --> 00:02:13,750
Like, the new programmer is going to do this,
like, having a button and then, like, hello,

37
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:19,390
Jan -- it's going to do it with a
real breadboard and a button and an LED that

38
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:20,390
flashes.

39
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:24,880
You cannot imagine how
incredibly happy I was, after I got my Arduino

40
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:29,280
starter kit, and I wrote some
code that made an LED blink.

41
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,959
You know?

42
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:32,060
I was like this.

43
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:33,260
Like, showing my mom.

44
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:34,260
Like, hey, mom.

45
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:36,769
You can type in your name in a computer and
it spits your name

46
00:02:36,769 --> 00:02:37,950
back out.

47
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:42,459
And I have not been as enthusiastic as this
about computers in a

48
00:02:42,459 --> 00:02:43,829
long time.

49
00:02:43,829 --> 00:02:49,000
And finally, doing all these hardware things,
that is what gets me totally

50
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
into this.

51
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,890
So we can take our code out of this confined
box, and into the real

52
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:55,920
world.

53
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:01,900
And this is a revolution that is just getting
started.

54
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:02,900
We're nowhere
near yet.

55
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:07,459
We don't know what is going on, or how it's
going to end up.

56
00:03:07,459 --> 00:03:10,180
But,
like, looking at all these extremely smart

57
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:16,739
people, one thing I know for sure
-- that this revolution is going to be led

58
00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:19,540
by JavaScript.

59
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:22,100
I can imagine you
guys are also incredibly tired.

60
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:27,329
Like, three days of, like, full on action.

61
00:03:27,329 --> 00:03:32,489
So today we're going to have, like, a fun,
nice demo-full talk.

62
00:03:32,489 --> 00:03:34,920
We're going to
have audience participation.

63
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,810
Yes, real audience participation.

64
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:38,060
Isn't that
cool?

65
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:41,140
And we're going to have a fuckton of GIFs.

66
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:42,890
So...

67
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:46,390
All right!

68
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:48,150
Okay.

69
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:50,010
So the
first thing that I want to talk to you about

70
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:55,879
today is computer-generated
music.

71
00:03:55,879 --> 00:04:01,329
A lot of the music that we listen to today
is, for a smaller or bigger

72
00:04:01,329 --> 00:04:03,819
part, is really kind of coming out of a computer.

73
00:04:03,819 --> 00:04:05,760
Like, your drum loops might
be recorded.

74
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,129
You might sing something in, and then add
effects to it on your

75
00:04:09,129 --> 00:04:10,129
PC.

76
00:04:10,129 --> 00:04:14,590
There's, like, a group of people that take
this one step further.

77
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:17,570
And that's people that do Algoraves.

78
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:21,250
For me, this is the nerdiest thing, but it's
like...

79
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:25,660
Nerds are taking over the world.

80
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:26,850
Like, really.

81
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:27,850
Like...

82
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:30,360
A computer guy,
standing in front of an audience, like, live

83
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:33,620
coding, and people start dancing
towards that?

84
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:36,250
Man, shit, that's...

85
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:37,250
Poom!

86
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:42,070
So three years ago, Alex McLean
started this movement, and last year at JSConf

87
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:51,110
Asia, I met a PhD from UCSB,
Charlie Roberts, who made JavaScript environments

88
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:53,340
for Algoravers.

89
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:58,710
And it's an
online IDE with a DSL that allows you to write

90
00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:03,190
code and, like, make people
dance to that.

91
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:04,980
It's like for electronic music.

92
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:07,570
So let's say I want to make a
beat.

93
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:09,540
All I need to do is -- A is drums.

94
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:12,580
And then just a beat.

95
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:15,450
Put it a little
bit up.

96
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:17,650
That's basic.

97
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:18,650
Pretty cool.

98
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:22,570
It took me six years or something to get
this out of a normal drum kit.

99
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:24,950
And I can do it with one line of JS.

100
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:27,410
We can
also add a little pitch to it.

101
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:29,980
So you can play around with variables.

102
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:32,150
Pretty cool.

103
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:34,430
There's a lot more you can do.

104
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:35,610
Like Vocoding.

105
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:37,960
For example, here
is...

106
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:40,890
Like, our own JSConf song.

107
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:41,890
JSConf.

108
00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:42,890


109
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:43,890
JSConf.

110
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:49,120
(robot voices saying JSConf in various pitches
over and over again

111
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,120
rhythmically)

112
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:55,020
Now, if you look closely at this, you can
see there is a whole number of

113
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:58,340
variables in this code.

114
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:00,870
And these are parameters that directly influence
the

115
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:02,040
music.

116
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:05,410
If you set the pitch of the drum, you get,
like, an actual different

117
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:06,410
sound.

118
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:08,490
Like, for programmers, this is amazing.

119
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:09,510
You know?

120
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:12,330
If you're standing
there in front of an audience, you can play

121
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:13,330
around with the parameters.

122
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:15,780
Nothing is very static.

123
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:19,430
Once you pick one, that's basically it.

124
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:21,250
That's what
it's going to be.

125
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:23,220
Then I thought...

126
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:25,780
What else do you see at concerts these
days?

127
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:27,720
Like, way too much...

128
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:31,160
Mobile phones.

129
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:36,590
And mobile phones are now pretty good at,
like, capturing what's happening

130
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:43,030
around you, because mobile phones have sensors,
sensors, sensors, and sensors.

131
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:44,030
So...

132
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:47,840
Today we're going to do a nice little experiment,
where you guys are

133
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:51,100
going to help me produce some music.

134
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:54,430
Because we're going to use the sensor
data of all your phones...

135
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:58,330
And I have no clue how many phones my computer
is

136
00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:00,050
going to be able to handle.

137
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:05,840
It'll all get uploaded to a node.js server,
and

138
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:10,710
then we feed the data from all of you together
into a music generating

139
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:12,030
algorithm.

140
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:15,130
So you guys have influence over how the music
is going to sound

141
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:17,690
today.

142
00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:21,560
If you want to play around with this later
or if you are a cool Algoraver,

143
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,940
this code is on Github, so you can integrate
it.

144
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:32,891
So instead of set variable
for the pitch, we can get the yaw or the pitch

145
00:07:32,891 --> 00:07:35,780
of all your phones, and then
feed that into the algorithm.

146
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:39,400
So when people start moving around the phones,
music will actually change.

147
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:42,100
Here's a variable.

148
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:43,100
Okay.

149
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:48,060
This is one of the demos
we're going to do today.

150
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:51,840
Another one...

151
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:57,100
Because your mobile phone is still
really confined by what the sensor can detect.

152
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:59,850
Gyrometer or accelerometer.

153
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:05,970
But
Bluetooth beacons -- I have a few here.

154
00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:07,900
They're tiny chips.

155
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:12,050
They don't run
JavaScript, but they just broadcast their

156
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:13,300
existence.

157
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:16,730
I can put one on the wall
and for the next two years, it will just say...

158
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:19,780
Hey, I'm here, I'm here, I'm
here, I'm here.

159
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:20,790
They're getting tiny.

160
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:21,810
This is the new estimation.

161
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:24,300
They go for
$10.

162
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:30,910
Tiny, small, you can broadcast a value like
a URL or sensor values.

163
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:37,130
Now, the cool thing is that the ability to
detect beacons, to walk into a room

164
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:41,800
and see -- okay, there's ten around you in
five meters -- is coming to

165
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:45,880
JavaScript.

166
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:49,240
We actually finished implementing this in
Firefox OS and hope to

167
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:54,010
bring it to Firefox for Android on short notice.

168
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:56,730
After June it's going to be
accessible.

169
00:08:56,730 --> 00:08:59,620
So we have phones that run this and I'll do
some demos for that.

170
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:02,020
How do you scan for beacons?

171
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:03,700
It's straightforward.

172
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:08,800
The most Bluetooth thing is
not standardized yet, but in the web Bluetooth

173
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:12,450
standards, we're talking about
implementing low energy support for Bluetooth.

174
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:15,810
So this is coming to the
standards track.

175
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:19,030
We can get the adapter, start a low energy
scan.

176
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:22,910
We're not
interested in all the devices around us.

177
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:25,690
And then when a device is found, we
get an event.

178
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:29,370
A couple seconds later, we can stop.

179
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:32,010
The event you get contains
a scan record.

180
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:35,630
And that basically is all the data you send
it.

181
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:39,280
Most things currently follow the iBeacon standards
from Apple, and that gives

182
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:42,150
you three IDs, essentially.

183
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:45,600
A UUID for a manufacturer, a major, and a
minor.

184
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,400
So that's how you can detect which beacon
is what.

185
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:51,170
Now, what are we going to
do with this today?

186
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:54,150
The JavaScript baby monitor.

187
00:09:54,150 --> 00:10:00,650
So you're going to tag a baby
with a phone.

188
00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:04,280
Then on the phone, we run some JavaScript
that constantly

189
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:06,940
searches around for the beacons.

190
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:11,250
Then based on how strong the signal is, we're
going to triangulate from the three beacons

191
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:16,120
with some math, and that way we
know where in the room the baby is located.

192
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:19,440
Now, you might think...

193
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,290
Tagging a
baby with a phone -- is that really necessary,

194
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:23,290
Jan?

195
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:28,460
At JSConf EU I presented a
project called Jan OS that allows you to rip

196
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:32,180
apart the main board of your
phone and tag your baby with that.

197
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:34,500
So you can make a child-friendly device.

198
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:37,070
I'm not going to talk about that today.

199
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:38,500
Let's see what this looks like.

200
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:41,050
We
have a baby.

201
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:45,820
We position three beacons around it.

202
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:52,050
And then we tag the baby with the
chipboard.

203
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:54,120
Now...

204
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:57,160
We basically know how far from the beacon
we are, because we

205
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:58,779
get signal strength.

206
00:10:58,779 --> 00:11:02,550
So if we combine the data from three beacons,
we realize

207
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:08,230
that where these intersect, that is where
the baby has to be.

208
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:11,880
And then, when
the baby runs away, then we can start doing

209
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:14,450
alarm.

210
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:15,450
Pretty simple, right?

211
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:17,230
All
on JavaScript.

212
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:18,230
So...

213
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:20,230
Demo time.

214
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:30,120
If you're on the JSConf track A Wi-Fi network,
then get yourself over to 192.168.157.18,

215
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:32,480
port 9321.

216
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,660
Because that is where the
magic is going to happen.

217
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:36,660
So...

218
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:41,100
What you're going to see on your screen is
essentially a dot.

219
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:44,720
And this dot is getting influenced by the
way you rotate

220
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:51,350
your phone in physical space.

221
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:59,080
So I'm going to go to my command center.

222
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,660
So here we have all the people.

223
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:04,570
We
have ten people connected, and we're getting

224
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:07,190
the data from all the phones.

225
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:08,380
Averaging it.

226
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:09,570
(mid-tempo beat)

227
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:12,210
And the way you pitch it.

228
00:12:12,210 --> 00:12:13,920
And we can make some music.

229
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:18,940
So if you hold your
phone like this, we should be able to go exactly

230
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:23,660
in the center.

231
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:28,330
And now I want
to move it like to the left top corner.

232
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:33,700
So change your phone in physical space
to the left top corner.

233
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:36,120
(beat pitch distorts)

234
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,224
There's so many people connected now.

235
00:12:37,224 --> 00:12:38,470
One person is doing it.

236
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:41,600
Get over
there, and see how the music changes.

237
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,830
(beat pitch bends downward)

238
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:49,130
You feel how the music changes a little bit?

239
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:55,520
Depending how high or how low
the thing is, we have echoing and pitch.

240
00:12:55,520 --> 00:13:03,710
And it's always hard to do audience
participation in this thing.

241
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:06,100
It's crazy, right?

242
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:11,080
So my server is completely
going berserk on this.

243
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:15,110
(drum machine beat continues)

244
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:17,830
I can show how to works with just one person.

245
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:22,070
Because this is totally not
how I thought it would work.

246
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:25,080
So I'm connecting myself to my own network.

247
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,430
And...

248
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:31,430
Then go to the page.

249
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:32,430
Okay.

250
00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:36,410
So now it's just me.

251
00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:39,120
And when I move it...

252
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,540
(bass distorts)

253
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:46,440
You can get pretty rad effects out of this

254
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:49,390
(pitch of bass distorts)

255
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:55,010
And at some point you can echo it so it starts
beeping.

256
00:13:55,010 --> 00:13:57,050
It's not fun for
anyone.

257
00:13:57,050 --> 00:14:03,720
Now, we can also do this with visuals.

258
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:07,950
So now, when I move it...

259
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:10,890
(erratic rhythm)

260
00:14:10,890 --> 00:14:16,070
So based on how high the thing is, the BPM
is dependent.

261
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:18,370
So now it's nice
and relaxing.

262
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:24,730
If you move it all the way over here...

263
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:27,570
It changes how the music
feels.

264
00:14:27,570 --> 00:14:28,890
(rhythm accelerates)

265
00:14:28,890 --> 00:14:33,980
With all these people, it would go better,
but it was more than it could...

266
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:34,980
Now we have BPM.

267
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:40,400
But we can add some extra magic to it.

268
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:43,080
So here's the code we
have.

269
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:46,540
Let's go full screen.

270
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:49,620
Essentially what we can just write is...

271
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:53,410
Like, get
a drum sequence, then the amplitude is, like,

272
00:14:53,410 --> 00:14:57,710
based on data that we get from
the phone, and the BPM is based on other data

273
00:14:57,710 --> 00:15:00,480
that we get from the phone.

274
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:06,980
Now,
I made a thing that parses a GIF and can dynamically

275
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:11,030
change the speed of the
GIF based on how fast the music is playing.

276
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:15,120
(mellow drum machine beat)

277
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:20,250
Now I like it a little slower.

278
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:26,470
Or we can go completely crazy.

279
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:28,850
(beat accelerates)

280
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:31,230
All right.

281
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:32,560
So that was the music.

282
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:35,060
I'm going to let the music play a bit.

283
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:37,430
And then I'm going to set up...

284
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:40,680
My beacons.

285
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:43,680
So let's say that this is the
area.

286
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,380
(stopping music)

287
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:51,010
So let's say this is the area where the baby
is allowed to go.

288
00:15:51,010 --> 00:15:55,040
So I'm
putting a light blue beacon here.

289
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,500
I measured this before.

290
00:15:56,500 --> 00:16:02,190
It's a bit over 3
meters, which is in United States measurements

291
00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:07,280
I think 81.4 stones.

292
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:09,620
(laughter)

293
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:14,200
So we have three here.

294
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,420
And now...

295
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:26,959
Let's go to that page.

296
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:28,600
So this is where
the data is going to come in.

297
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:33,640
So I'm going to put the phone here.

298
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:36,380
Just to make
sure that we're getting the data.

299
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:37,380
And...

300
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:41,390
Zoom out a little.

301
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:47,540
Whenever the data
is now coming in, it will redraw.

302
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:49,490
So we're connected.

303
00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:50,830
And data should start
flowing in.

304
00:16:50,830 --> 00:16:54,360
So as you can see, the...

305
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:58,250
How big the circle is depends on where I
position the phone.

306
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:01,070
So now we're just waiting for the data from
the main

307
00:17:01,070 --> 00:17:04,380
beacon, which is the one here.

308
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:06,520
It really varies at this point.

309
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,490
And it's
because we get, like, the raw value, and the

310
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:11,270
raw value is really dependent on
a lot of factors.

311
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:13,899
So we can buffer.

312
00:17:13,899 --> 00:17:19,150
And then it will slowly remove all the
drift, and we get a better positioning.

313
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:22,909
We can also draw the intersections.

314
00:17:22,909 --> 00:17:25,539
And based on that, we can get the average.

315
00:17:25,539 --> 00:17:29,559
So if I move the phone or baby...

316
00:17:29,559 --> 00:17:34,410
To, for example, here...

317
00:17:34,410 --> 00:17:38,179
You can see that,
like, the actual position that we detect is

318
00:17:38,179 --> 00:17:40,380
actually getting there.

319
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:43,470
If I start
moving the thing around, luckily enough, babies

320
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:44,529
are not very fast.

321
00:17:44,529 --> 00:17:47,129
So it's
okay if it takes a couple of seconds.

322
00:17:47,129 --> 00:17:49,809
So I'm moving it here.

323
00:17:49,809 --> 00:17:53,389
Then you'll see
that the position of the orange dots will

324
00:17:53,389 --> 00:17:57,309
start to change.

325
00:17:57,309 --> 00:18:01,730
We cannot do this
-- if the baby gets out of the bounding box,

326
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:07,670
then if the baby gets out of the
bounding box, we can sound an alarm or do

327
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:10,580
something about it.

328
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:14,090
So we're here.

329
00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:15,090
And now you see it like...

330
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:18,549
You see it moving towards the purple one.

331
00:18:18,549 --> 00:18:21,389
Now, I
figured -- like, okay, that's pretty cool.

332
00:18:21,389 --> 00:18:26,039
But what if you could listen to
baby-generated music?

333
00:18:26,039 --> 00:18:28,499
So...

334
00:18:28,499 --> 00:18:31,360
We're going to open the baby thing.

335
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:37,179
And we're going to apply the data
that we get out of here, like, the position

336
00:18:37,179 --> 00:18:43,639
of the baby in physical space, and
feed that into a music generating algorithm.

337
00:18:43,639 --> 00:18:49,909
(discordant beats)

338
00:18:49,909 --> 00:18:53,659
So the idea is that whenever the baby is in
this space where it's allowed

339
00:18:53,659 --> 00:18:56,809
to go, everything is all right.

340
00:18:56,809 --> 00:19:01,419
We don't really have to play big-ass crazy
music.

341
00:19:01,419 --> 00:19:07,610
Have we got a visual on the thing?

342
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:08,610
Okay.

343
00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:10,789
But now what if the baby
starts to escape?

344
00:19:10,789 --> 00:19:11,789
You know?

345
00:19:11,789 --> 00:19:13,330
That would be disturbing.

346
00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:14,630
For some reason it
doesn't work yet.

347
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:18,879
So I'm going to restart the application with
the phone.

348
00:19:18,879 --> 00:19:22,090
So
when the baby escapes, we can change the BPM

349
00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:23,610
of the music a lot.

350
00:19:23,610 --> 00:19:27,360
So we need to
check out something.

351
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,509
Crazy stuff is happening.

352
00:19:29,509 --> 00:19:31,249
So here we go.

353
00:19:31,249 --> 00:19:35,629
(BPM gets slower)

354
00:19:35,629 --> 00:19:36,629
So relaxed...

355
00:19:36,629 --> 00:19:40,179
And...

356
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:46,010
Let's see if I run away fast enough...

357
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:48,909
If you can...

358
00:19:48,909 --> 00:19:50,429
Having technical...

359
00:19:50,429 --> 00:19:52,779
The mint one just stopped working.

360
00:19:52,779 --> 00:19:55,380
Go, go, go, go.

361
00:19:55,380 --> 00:20:06,659
If
necessary, just go to the pizza guy.

362
00:20:06,659 --> 00:20:13,600
(BPM stays the same tempo) (BPM increases
rapidly)

363
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:14,600
Music!

364
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:15,600
Fast!

365
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,600
We need to act on this shit now!

366
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:17,600
Thank you!

367
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:21,519
(BPM continues to accelerate)

368
00:20:21,519 --> 00:20:23,710
All right.

369
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:28,059
Let me close that thing off and get back to
my slides.

370
00:20:28,059 --> 00:20:29,220
(music turns off)

371
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:32,549
Now, we have ten more minutes, you know?

372
00:20:32,549 --> 00:20:40,640
And I figured I always wanted,
like, a real one more thing moment.

373
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:43,559
Um...

374
00:20:43,559 --> 00:20:51,500
So, I mean, I've been working on
Firefox OS on a variety of platforms.

375
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:55,490
Now we're focusing on the internet of
things.

376
00:20:55,490 --> 00:20:58,799
The thing is, Firefox OS is not just about
phones anymore.

377
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:00,700
It's
televisions.

378
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:01,989
Things that can run on it.

379
00:21:01,989 --> 00:21:05,619
We also want to bridge the gap to the
physical space.

380
00:21:05,619 --> 00:21:14,360
And for that, we invested in a number of technologies,
including Bluetooth low energy, virtual reality,

381
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:19,980
with Firefox VR, but also web
CL, which allows you to get a video stream

382
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:22,889
and start detecting stuff on that.

383
00:21:22,889 --> 00:21:28,269
And from that premise, we started thinking
about -- what if we would design a

384
00:21:28,269 --> 00:21:32,789
wearable running Mozilla technology?

385
00:21:32,789 --> 00:21:36,669
And we figured that the beacon stuff
would be incredibly useful.

386
00:21:36,669 --> 00:21:43,240
Because if we -- for $3 can get, like, a beacon
straight from the factory, and tag that at,

387
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:48,159
like, interesting places, or tag
it to people, it would allow us to, like,

388
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:52,590
augment your reality, like, based on
where you physically are in the world.

389
00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:55,419
Walking around.

390
00:21:55,419 --> 00:21:59,179
Of course, this also
has to be built on open standards.

391
00:21:59,179 --> 00:22:06,039
And today you guys are going to see the
very, very, very first wearable that Mozilla

392
00:22:06,039 --> 00:22:07,210
has been working on.

393
00:22:07,210 --> 00:22:09,850
Like, right
here on JSConf, like, a couple minutes before

394
00:22:09,850 --> 00:22:11,610
the end.

395
00:22:11,610 --> 00:22:13,379
Pretty exciting.

396
00:22:13,379 --> 00:22:16,720
So the
first wearable that we together, like, with

397
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:20,470
Mozilla and a bunch of partners
have built, is...

398
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:24,249
Mozilla Glass.

399
00:22:24,249 --> 00:22:27,450
And I got it with me, actually, here today.

400
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:28,450
So...

401
00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:32,880
We looked at, like, what
other wearables are around at this point.

402
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:37,960
And we had, like, a number of things
that we required.

403
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:42,799
So first of all, we wanted to work any type
of glasses.

404
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:43,860
Prescription or sunglasses.

405
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:45,610
It doesn't really matter.

406
00:22:45,610 --> 00:22:49,230
The prototype that we
have here is mounted on the glasses that you

407
00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:51,669
got in your goodie bag.

408
00:22:51,669 --> 00:22:56,239
It's the
Availity track?

409
00:22:56,239 --> 00:22:57,239
What the company is called?

410
00:22:57,239 --> 00:22:59,450
And the glasses were from the same
brand.

411
00:22:59,450 --> 00:23:02,200
We also want that to be a standalone product.

412
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:04,450
No extra device required.

413
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:09,609
There's voice control to get, like, information
without always looking at your

414
00:23:09,609 --> 00:23:10,609
screen.

415
00:23:10,609 --> 00:23:13,859
And the self-build kit is going for about
$300 US.

416
00:23:13,859 --> 00:23:16,249
Are you ready?

417
00:23:16,249 --> 00:23:18,239
(cheering)

418
00:23:18,239 --> 00:23:22,220
All right.

419
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:23,220
First thing.

420
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:24,220
Mozilla Glass.

421
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:36,139
Hand built by me.

422
00:23:36,139 --> 00:23:37,239
So what we see
here...

423
00:23:37,239 --> 00:23:38,239
And I've got one with me.

424
00:23:38,239 --> 00:23:39,570
We're going to demonstrate in a sec.

425
00:23:39,570 --> 00:23:43,799
We have
a camera module on top.

426
00:23:43,799 --> 00:23:48,639
On the left, we have the display and sensors.

427
00:23:48,639 --> 00:23:51,399
These
two talk with each other over a web RTC connection

428
00:23:51,399 --> 00:23:55,269
to get the data from the
camera into your corner.

429
00:23:55,269 --> 00:23:58,470
And then we have a small little mirror in
the inner

430
00:23:58,470 --> 00:24:02,570
side of your glasses, so you can look a bit
to the right and get your image

431
00:24:02,570 --> 00:24:04,749
from the display on the left.

432
00:24:04,749 --> 00:24:07,450
All right.

433
00:24:07,450 --> 00:24:08,809
So...

434
00:24:08,809 --> 00:24:12,749
For this, for this next
segment, I need to have Steve, Jacob, and

435
00:24:12,749 --> 00:24:15,889
Chris on stage, because they're
going to help me with this thing.

436
00:24:15,889 --> 00:24:25,139
So guys, run up, run up, run up.

437
00:24:25,139 --> 00:24:26,139
All right.

438
00:24:26,139 --> 00:24:27,890
Where the hell are my beacons?

439
00:24:27,890 --> 00:24:28,980
Oh, here.

440
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:31,950
Oh, you're going to be Chris
Williams.

441
00:24:31,950 --> 00:24:33,490
Okay.

442
00:24:33,490 --> 00:24:35,679
So I need you guys to, like, okay.

443
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:39,279
What we're going to do
is...

444
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:40,369
It's like a party.

445
00:24:40,369 --> 00:24:41,450
You know?

446
00:24:41,450 --> 00:24:42,539
Here.

447
00:24:42,539 --> 00:24:45,429
And I want to know who do I have to
talk to at parties?

448
00:24:45,429 --> 00:24:46,429
You know?

449
00:24:46,429 --> 00:24:49,990
I want to be, like, the cool guy that always
knows the subject to talk about and people

450
00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:51,039
think you're interesting.

451
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:52,720
What are
we going to do today?

452
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:55,600
Let's say we tag all these people with beacons.

453
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:59,720
Steve
gets ice, Jacob gets blueberry, and you get

454
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:00,720
mint.

455
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:04,359
And I need you to be
socially awkward and stand by yourself at

456
00:25:04,359 --> 00:25:07,909
a party.

457
00:25:07,909 --> 00:25:10,690
Not too close to each
other, please.

458
00:25:10,690 --> 00:25:12,739
Yeah, a bit...

459
00:25:12,739 --> 00:25:16,489
Like, near the stage, please.

460
00:25:16,489 --> 00:25:19,660
I'm going to go to...

461
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:20,660
So the
beautiful thing is...

462
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:23,249
Because of the web RTC that gets the camera,
we can also

463
00:25:23,249 --> 00:25:27,479
get a live feed here of the screen.

464
00:25:27,479 --> 00:25:31,649
Go there.

465
00:25:31,649 --> 00:25:32,649
Mozilla Glass.

466
00:25:32,649 --> 00:25:35,340
As you can see,
we're not connected to anything here.

467
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:39,629
I am going to come here.

468
00:25:39,629 --> 00:25:42,130
This is going
to be my camera client.

469
00:25:42,130 --> 00:25:43,419
Huh?

470
00:25:43,419 --> 00:25:44,720
So...

471
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:48,600
Here we go.

472
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:49,890
And...

473
00:25:49,890 --> 00:25:55,230
Here we've got the
glasses.

474
00:25:55,230 --> 00:26:00,929
Let me just verify that we're still connected.

475
00:26:00,929 --> 00:26:01,929
Yeah.

476
00:26:01,929 --> 00:26:05,419
You know,
hardware is a lot of fun.

477
00:26:05,419 --> 00:26:09,220
I'm so hoping that on Twitter people will
go

478
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:11,240
completely crazy.

479
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:15,259
Like Mozilla introduces a wearable!

480
00:26:15,259 --> 00:26:16,259
So we're connected.

481
00:26:16,259 --> 00:26:18,169
I don't see any beacons yet, but that is going
to come.

482
00:26:18,169 --> 00:26:21,299
I'm going to place this on my head.

483
00:26:21,299 --> 00:26:25,120
I'm going to connect to my camera module
here.

484
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,539
So...

485
00:26:26,539 --> 00:26:28,970
I ran out of duct tape.

486
00:26:28,970 --> 00:26:30,530
So...

487
00:26:30,530 --> 00:26:35,500
The moment that I connect to this
thing...

488
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:37,159
We should start seeing a video stream here.

489
00:26:37,159 --> 00:26:38,159
Okay.

490
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:39,159
So here we are.

491
00:26:39,159 --> 00:26:42,350
Now, of course, we have voice controls as
well.

492
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:43,509
And for...

493
00:26:43,509 --> 00:26:45,659
Ah, wait.

494
00:26:45,659 --> 00:26:47,820
That
is...

495
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:48,899
So we have voice control as well.

496
00:26:48,899 --> 00:26:54,669
We partnered with Andreas Gal, the CTO
of Mozilla, to do the voicing.

497
00:26:54,669 --> 00:26:58,330
I wanted Brendan Eyck, but he said ask Taylor
Swift.

498
00:26:58,330 --> 00:27:01,529
Did you guys get a stream here?

499
00:27:01,529 --> 00:27:02,529
Okay.

500
00:27:02,529 --> 00:27:06,509
So let me full screen this thing.

501
00:27:06,509 --> 00:27:08,499
Yeah.

502
00:27:08,499 --> 00:27:18,590
That's pretty hard to see with these glasses
on.

503
00:27:18,590 --> 00:27:19,890
(laughter)

504
00:27:19,890 --> 00:27:21,190
Oh.

505
00:27:21,190 --> 00:27:22,490
Okay.

506
00:27:22,490 --> 00:27:23,789
So...

507
00:27:23,789 --> 00:27:27,419
Back to the thing.

508
00:27:27,419 --> 00:27:29,600
Okay.

509
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:30,909
So here we are.

510
00:27:30,909 --> 00:27:31,909
Back.

511
00:27:31,909 --> 00:27:33,130
On the
stream.

512
00:27:33,130 --> 00:27:37,359
Need to have some sensor data out of here
as well.

513
00:27:37,359 --> 00:27:39,259
That would be nice.

514
00:27:39,259 --> 00:27:43,220
Because now I can ask my voice assistant to
come on stage.

515
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:44,759
Hello, Andreas.

516
00:27:44,759 --> 00:27:47,409
Can
you introduce yourself?

517
00:27:47,409 --> 00:27:49,470
Hello from Mozilla Glass.

518
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:55,549
I am Andreas Gau, CTO of Mozilla.

519
00:27:55,549 --> 00:28:00,590
Because we of course also care about other
companies that are working in

520
00:28:00,590 --> 00:28:05,919
the same space, like Google...

521
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:07,259
We have...

522
00:28:07,259 --> 00:28:08,599
Sorry.

523
00:28:08,599 --> 00:28:12,820
Now I really need to get some
assistance.

524
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:16,169
I mean, I can say...

525
00:28:16,169 --> 00:28:18,609
Andreas, call me Google.

526
00:28:18,609 --> 00:28:20,570
Okay, Google.

527
00:28:20,570 --> 00:28:22,289
Isn't that nice?

528
00:28:22,289 --> 00:28:24,470
All right.

529
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:28,830
Can you start the...

530
00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:29,919
Fuuu...

531
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:31,009
This...

532
00:28:31,009 --> 00:28:36,590
You know,
this worked so well in my head.

533
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:40,730
(laughter)

534
00:28:40,730 --> 00:28:45,830
Need a hand?

535
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:46,830
Yeah.

536
00:28:46,830 --> 00:28:47,830
Okay.

537
00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:48,830
So...

538
00:28:48,830 --> 00:28:51,559
You can hold them yourself.

539
00:28:51,559 --> 00:28:55,190
So we're going to get the
video stream back at this point.

540
00:28:55,190 --> 00:28:59,720
I mean, it looks pretty good on you, to be
honest.

541
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:00,730
Okay.

542
00:29:00,730 --> 00:29:01,739
So...

543
00:29:01,739 --> 00:29:05,059
Now, let's do the augmented reality thing.

544
00:29:05,059 --> 00:29:06,989
And I want you
to walk over there.

545
00:29:06,989 --> 00:29:11,409
Where do you have the beacon?

546
00:29:11,409 --> 00:29:13,340
So...

547
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:15,090
This is supposed to
be...

548
00:29:15,090 --> 00:29:16,090
Okay.

549
00:29:16,090 --> 00:29:17,389
So get a bit closer.

550
00:29:17,389 --> 00:29:20,229
You need to be in close proximity.

551
00:29:20,229 --> 00:29:26,049
We're at a
party here.

552
00:29:26,049 --> 00:29:29,889
So whenever this works, this is, like, always
a good thing, to

553
00:29:29,889 --> 00:29:31,539
have a backup Glass.

554
00:29:31,539 --> 00:29:32,539
Not mounted.

555
00:29:32,539 --> 00:29:41,080
Like real glasses.

556
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:42,909
So here we go.

557
00:29:42,909 --> 00:29:45,859
Steve
Kinney!

558
00:29:45,859 --> 00:29:47,340
Information!

559
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:50,639
This is augmented reality, guys!

560
00:29:50,639 --> 00:29:51,909
Now...

561
00:29:51,909 --> 00:29:56,260
And as you can see, the moment that we
walk away, immediately the information disappears

562
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:59,359
as well, and we can do the
same thing with Jacob here.

563
00:29:59,359 --> 00:30:02,549
I was hoping somebody would come talk to me.

564
00:30:02,549 --> 00:30:03,979
That would be nice.

565
00:30:03,979 --> 00:30:05,940
So what can we talk about with you today?

566
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:07,179
Hey, man.

567
00:30:07,179 --> 00:30:10,010
How is it going with you?

568
00:30:10,010 --> 00:30:11,010
Hey, Jacob.

569
00:30:11,010 --> 00:30:15,229
We could talk about the Cure.

570
00:30:15,229 --> 00:30:17,090
Or if we can talk to Chris Williams...

571
00:30:17,090 --> 00:30:18,619
Everyone knows him.

572
00:30:18,619 --> 00:30:21,139
Hey, hey, Chris.

573
00:30:21,139 --> 00:30:26,690
What should I do with the drone battery?

574
00:30:26,690 --> 00:30:28,019
Oh, you know like...

575
00:30:28,019 --> 00:30:29,049
Oh, hey.

576
00:30:29,049 --> 00:30:31,639
Hi, it's me, Chris Williams.

577
00:30:31,639 --> 00:30:36,109
I just thought I should mention that
you might want to not put that drone battery

578
00:30:36,109 --> 00:30:39,279
in your checked luggage.

579
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:41,830
Uh...

580
00:30:41,830 --> 00:30:44,390
(applause)

581
00:30:44,390 --> 00:30:49,499
All right!

582
00:30:49,499 --> 00:30:51,720
So it can also tell you based on the voice
commands who you're

583
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:52,720
near.

584
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,019
Will do.

585
00:30:54,019 --> 00:30:56,049
You're not near anyone.

586
00:30:56,049 --> 00:30:57,700
I'm not near anyone.

587
00:30:57,700 --> 00:30:58,700
And this is the coolest feature.

588
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:00,889
It will also shoot
laser beams.

589
00:31:00,889 --> 00:31:02,450
I'm sorry, Jan.

590
00:31:02,450 --> 00:31:05,549
I'm afraid I can't do that.

591
00:31:05,549 --> 00:31:07,110
Okay.

592
00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:08,669
So...

593
00:31:08,669 --> 00:31:13,359
Here's the thing.

594
00:31:13,359 --> 00:31:14,359
We cannot predict the future.

595
00:31:14,359 --> 00:31:16,019
You know?

596
00:31:16,019 --> 00:31:17,289
It's
2015.

597
00:31:17,289 --> 00:31:18,909
Where the hell is my hoverboard?

598
00:31:18,909 --> 00:31:23,989
Actually, after, like, yesterday's
event with the nodecopters, we decided we

599
00:31:23,989 --> 00:31:25,440
no longer want hoverboards.

600
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:30,609
We want
quad copters or drones that can carry people.

601
00:31:30,609 --> 00:31:32,590
We can't predict the future.

602
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:34,859
But
one thing we know for sure.

603
00:31:34,859 --> 00:31:36,860
And I hope that today's demonstration, even
though

604
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:41,220
it was a bit flaky at times, is like a demonstration
of that.

605
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:43,789
And like the
whole JSConf thing -- and this is the thing

606
00:31:43,789 --> 00:31:48,190
that you have to take home from
all of this -- we can't predict the future.

607
00:31:48,190 --> 00:31:55,889
But we do know that a large part
of that is going to be written in JavaScript.

608
00:31:55,889 --> 00:31:59,799
And with that, my 30 minutes are
up, and I really, really want to thank you

609
00:31:59,799 --> 00:32:01,039
all for being here.
