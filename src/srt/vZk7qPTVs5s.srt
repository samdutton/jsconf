2
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:09,870
all right hello everyone I'm Cassie I

3
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:14,280
work at Jimdo as a developer and today

4
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,949
we're going to talk about Houdini as I

5
00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:20,250
realized yesterday especially is that a

6
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:21,900
lot of people don't actually know what

7
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:25,109
Houdini is and so first thing we want to

8
00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:27,090
find out what it actually is and if you

9
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:29,250
google Houdini you find a lot of stuff

10
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:32,279
there's like a 3d animation software

11
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:36,960
that's used wide across the internet you

12
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,149
get to a sporting goods store where you

13
00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:42,600
can buy running shoes and stuff you're

14
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,250
actually on the first page you find a

15
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:51,750
chair buy some some some company and of

16
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:53,520
course you find that guy that's really

17
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,989
into chains called Harry Houdini who you

18
00:00:57,989 --> 00:01:02,460
probably know was a magician and well

19
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:05,339
that's actually the best reference you

20
00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:09,960
will get to the Houdini CSS thing that I

21
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:12,270
will be talking about because if you

22
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:14,820
look in the into what it actually is it

23
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:20,759
is an effort by the we w3c and first

24
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:23,520
explanation on the wiki page is the

25
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,100
objective of the CSS tag Houdini task

26
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:29,460
force CSS Houdini is jointly developed

27
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:31,590
features that explain the magic of

28
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:34,380
styling and layout on the web so just a

29
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:38,340
little bit general if you look a little

30
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:40,549
bit deeper you will find another

31
00:01:40,549 --> 00:01:45,360
explanation by Mozilla which says CSS

32
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:49,560
Houdini is a w3c effort to define

33
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:52,320
lower-level CSS api's for authors to

34
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,299
understand recreate and extend

35
00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:57,600
high-level CSS authoring features so

36
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,380
what we actually have here is something

37
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:03,930
where we can actually get into the inner

38
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:08,069
workings of CSS and work with that so

39
00:02:08,069 --> 00:02:09,899
where is the use case for that if you

40
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:12,840
think about it if new CSS features are

41
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:13,230
coming

42
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:15,390
and you read about them you're like oh

43
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:17,310
yeah that sounds really interesting and

44
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:19,319
I really want to use that and then you

45
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:22,140
figure out what I go to can I use I look

46
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:24,690
at at what browser support my CSS

47
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:26,220
feature and I figured well

48
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:27,980
chrome is supporting it and nothing else

49
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:31,200
and then I wait for two years and then I

50
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,819
get to use actually my CSS feature so

51
00:02:34,819 --> 00:02:38,510
this sucks we all know this sucks so

52
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:41,220
what can we do if we have this problem

53
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:43,980
in JavaScript what we do is we pull it

54
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:47,280
in polyfill it so we figure a way out to

55
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,239
go with our existing technologies and go

56
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:54,060
around to stuff we don't have and build

57
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:55,200
it in some other way

58
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,660
the problem for CSS is if you look at

59
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:02,129
what X's we have in the technologies we

60
00:03:02,129 --> 00:03:05,400
have especially in JavaScript yes we can

61
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:10,920
work with the Dom obviously and we have

62
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:13,200
a little bit of access to the CSS object

63
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,760
model but not really nice access it's

64
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:19,230
hard to understand how to work with it

65
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:21,299
and it doesn't really support much and

66
00:03:21,299 --> 00:03:23,669
all the other tasks that are happening

67
00:03:23,669 --> 00:03:25,739
if we are rendering stuff in the browser

68
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:30,750
with CSS where we parse the CSS we go

69
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:32,639
through the Cascade we go through the

70
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:35,639
layouting we go to the paint process of

71
00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:38,459
the browser we composite all that we

72
00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:40,709
have no access to there's no possibility

73
00:03:40,709 --> 00:03:43,919
good to go into that and this is exactly

74
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:48,660
where Houdini is coming in didn't - w3c

75
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:51,569
and pretty much all the big browser

76
00:03:51,569 --> 00:03:55,680
vendors coming together and they try to

77
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,780
define different api's and in Houdini

78
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:03,030
dare api's for the paint layer of the

79
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:06,180
process of rendering CSS you can go to

80
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:09,090
properties and values they want to get

81
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:14,180
you into the actual OCS CSS object model

82
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:16,769
there's a way to access the layout

83
00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:20,190
process the parser something for the

84
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:22,730
animation worklet some

85
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:26,090
for funds and a bunch of other stuff

86
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:29,120
that's not really punched out yet and

87
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:33,080
this talk I will mainly work with the

88
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:35,300
paint API the properties and layout

89
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:37,550
properties and values API and the typed

90
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:42,070
object model and that is mainly because

91
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:46,730
Houdini is really new and like the

92
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:48,710
support for adeney is very small as you

93
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:52,790
can see here the part of the API doesn't

94
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:55,430
even have a spec the font metrics API

95
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:58,550
doesn't even have a spec animation

96
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:02,780
worklet it's just a proposal now it has

97
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:04,640
a first working draft and as you know

98
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,980
like those those kind of things tend to

99
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:09,440
change a lot and therefore you can see

100
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,480
not many browsers actually are

101
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:15,950
implementing any of this yet but since

102
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:18,320
chrome 65 we got a bunch of stuff that's

103
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,840
actually on the live chrome and that is

104
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:23,510
the paint API and the type object model

105
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:26,570
and as well as some other stuff that we

106
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:30,290
have in canary and I think that's pretty

107
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:34,670
nice so let's actually look into how we

108
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:49,040
can use Houdini so what we actually have

109
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:53,860
to use Houdini is we are using

110
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:56,360
JavaScript to actually define what

111
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,370
should happen in a certain step what we

112
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:01,790
actually using here is the paint API and

113
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:03,710
what we are doing is we are creating a

114
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:06,470
worklet javascript worklet is something

115
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:08,720
a little bit like a web worker but

116
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,720
smaller and not that heavy weight

117
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:14,510
because if you look into the into the

118
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:17,060
spec of a web worker you will read that

119
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:19,160
it's not supposed to run a lot of times

120
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:22,340
and it's very heavy and that's why

121
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:25,340
worklets were created so this stuff can

122
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:28,250
actually be used on every paint that is

123
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:30,740
happening in the browser for the thing

124
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:33,500
that you are actually styling so as you

125
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,589
can see

126
00:06:35,589 --> 00:06:38,559
it's pretty much just a Java JavaScript

127
00:06:38,559 --> 00:06:43,389
class that I'm creating here in this

128
00:06:43,389 --> 00:06:47,049
JavaScript class we have a actually this

129
00:06:47,049 --> 00:06:49,539
this paint method that will get a

130
00:06:49,539 --> 00:06:55,079
context geometry and some props and

131
00:06:55,079 --> 00:06:58,629
maybe if you're familiar with canvas we

132
00:06:58,629 --> 00:07:00,459
will already see that it looks a little

133
00:07:00,459 --> 00:07:04,809
bit like that so the paint API this

134
00:07:04,809 --> 00:07:09,909
paint method is actually a subset of the

135
00:07:09,909 --> 00:07:12,939
canvas it's pretty much more or less

136
00:07:12,939 --> 00:07:16,569
it's the same only that it has no Dom it

137
00:07:16,569 --> 00:07:20,439
has no text possibility possibilities to

138
00:07:20,439 --> 00:07:21,699
work with text because we're only

139
00:07:21,699 --> 00:07:26,759
working with graphics and that thing and

140
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:29,559
there's no possibility to access image

141
00:07:29,559 --> 00:07:31,899
data and stuff like that so it's just

142
00:07:31,899 --> 00:07:34,929
like boiled down to the essentials to

143
00:07:34,929 --> 00:07:37,329
work with stuff like backgrounds and

144
00:07:37,329 --> 00:07:41,139
borders and other similar things so what

145
00:07:41,139 --> 00:07:44,559
I'm actually doing here is I'm creating

146
00:07:44,559 --> 00:07:48,039
a paintwork plate that's just rendering

147
00:07:48,039 --> 00:07:52,329
bars into a some some object in HTML so

148
00:07:52,329 --> 00:07:55,269
it's just gonna be a little bit like

149
00:07:55,269 --> 00:07:57,639
when you looking at audio files and

150
00:07:57,639 --> 00:08:01,029
they're dispensing bars and just some

151
00:08:01,029 --> 00:08:03,279
bars next to each other with you can see

152
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:06,039
it's just they're getting just a random

153
00:08:06,039 --> 00:08:10,569
height up here should have mirrored my

154
00:08:10,569 --> 00:08:16,239
monitor so yeah it's just like random

155
00:08:16,239 --> 00:08:18,129
height every time the paint is called

156
00:08:18,129 --> 00:08:21,219
and then what you have to do is just you

157
00:08:21,219 --> 00:08:24,669
register there paint with your class and

158
00:08:24,669 --> 00:08:28,299
give it a name which is dancing Boris so

159
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:31,839
next up what I will do is I go to the

160
00:08:31,839 --> 00:08:35,259
HTML and some it's just some small HTML

161
00:08:35,259 --> 00:08:36,969
file it's not really containing much

162
00:08:36,969 --> 00:08:41,259
except for this little script file you

163
00:08:41,259 --> 00:08:42,460
can do it in an Excel

164
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:45,070
but it's easier to do it here it's easy

165
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:48,510
to understand and what I do is I call

166
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:53,200
CSS the paint worklet and on this I add

167
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,750
the module worklet J's which is just my

168
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:58,120
worklet that I just showed you and

169
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,700
everything else I do is I add a text

170
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:02,950
area where the class are Dini and

171
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:05,170
another one which is sibling which is

172
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:06,370
not that important yet

173
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:10,630
and now the CSS part is coming up and

174
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:19,420
all I have to do in CSS is actually sexy

175
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:24,460
just go to a background image or you

176
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:26,260
could actually do it with a mask or with

177
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:31,860
a border and I had this paint method and

178
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:35,410
at the dancing bars name that I have

179
00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:39,610
written in here so this this thing was

180
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:42,400
registered on the paint method and now I

181
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:45,610
can call it in here in my CSS and what

182
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:56,320
this will turn out to is all right so

183
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,490
this is what actually is getting

184
00:09:57,490 --> 00:10:00,190
rendered it's just the text area it gets

185
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:03,240
random bars but as you can see if I

186
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:07,630
change the size of my text area every

187
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:10,990
time a render is called it changes

188
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:13,390
because I have random random Heights for

189
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:16,810
the bars and I just set the width of the

190
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:20,760
bars correlating to the width of my my

191
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:26,380
containing object so as you can see it's

192
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:29,320
always when I'm rendering if I go to my

193
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:32,920
text area and change let's say the color

194
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:39,190
of this of this it will not change

195
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:42,400
because this is not calling a paint only

196
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:45,940
if I change something like the margin it

197
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:47,620
will actually change because the paint

198
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:49,720
is called so you can see really nicely

199
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:53,560
that it's just happening on paint and

200
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:56,480
nowhere else so

201
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:00,770
but now this is kind of encapsulated you

202
00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:03,200
can't do much about it except for like

203
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:09,080
do some bars and if you look here the

204
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:11,030
color is hard-coded into it and I just

205
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:13,250
don't want to do that so what I can

206
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:16,700
actually use is CSS variables or custom

207
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:19,670
properties and those custom properties I

208
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:24,260
can use in my CSS to send some data to

209
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:27,500
my paintwork let what I have to do for

210
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:31,550
that is actually I've got it here so I

211
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:47,270
don't have to write it I go up here so

212
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:51,980
what I have to do is actually I get the

213
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:55,940
input properties and I return something

214
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:58,520
some variable that I call bar color and

215
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:01,390
now Houdini

216
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:04,510
will be smart enough to actually get

217
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:07,070
variables from the baccarat and put it

218
00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:09,620
into props because I put it into into

219
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:12,080
properties and now I can actually just

220
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:25,180
use it by calling props get with the

221
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:29,720
name of the proper I want to call so now

222
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,730
I'm calling bar colors another thing we

223
00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:33,460
have to do so

224
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:36,770
so Houdini is able to understand this is

225
00:12:36,770 --> 00:12:40,720
actually add a little bit of registry

226
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,940
register paint in here it has to be

227
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:46,610
registered on the CSS so it can be read

228
00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:48,230
out but the nice thing about this this

229
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:51,950
is actually typed so you can see the

230
00:12:51,950 --> 00:12:54,230
name is bar color I'm defining that the

231
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:57,050
sin taxes colors work which gives me

232
00:12:57,050 --> 00:13:02,060
some nice nice possibilities and I can

233
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:03,980
actually give it an initial value that

234
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:06,290
will be taken if I don't define this

235
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:08,750
property on my

236
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:12,740
CSS so as soon as I've done that I can

237
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:17,960
just go in here alright so next what I

238
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:21,320
will do is actually just go in here and

239
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:25,220
define this color that I defined which

240
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:38,540
is part color and give it some some

241
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:43,010
color and this should already change the

242
00:13:43,010 --> 00:13:45,200
color of the thing yes as you can see

243
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,360
it's now tomato and what you can do with

244
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,900
this is actually you can do whatever you

245
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:53,450
normally do with your CSS and so you can

246
00:13:53,450 --> 00:13:57,140
actually animate that thing so if I add

247
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:59,390
this keyframe animation which just

248
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:11,450
rotates the bar color and so if I had

249
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:13,610
this color rotation animation I give it

250
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:17,450
two seconds of animation I give it some

251
00:14:17,450 --> 00:14:20,240
steps so it doesn't like go crazy on me

252
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:25,670
because it's going to often and I run it

253
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:30,610
all the time you would see that actually

254
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:33,470
nothing happens what did I do wrong

255
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:41,140
oh yeah I said it to you I think

256
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:58,720
I don't know what oh yeah thank you

257
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:04,130
no anyway yes as you can see so I can

258
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:06,380
actually use all the capabilities of CSS

259
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:10,250
like animations to actually work with

260
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:16,730
this and make it better all right yeah

261
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:19,310
so far for that so back to the

262
00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:23,930
presentation let's do some real magic

263
00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:26,420
this was just a demo about what you

264
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:28,910
could do which is just make some bars

265
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:32,200
dance around which is not really useful

266
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:37,250
but what if we want to take a tomato and

267
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:40,100
turn it into a badass or better said

268
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:42,680
what if we want to make a gradient that

269
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:45,800
goes from tomato to badass and even

270
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,830
better what if we want to make it a

271
00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:51,440
conical gradient and CSS has a conical

272
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:54,050
gradient feature but the conical

273
00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:57,110
gradient feature as you can see is not

274
00:15:57,110 --> 00:16:03,830
supported very nicely so now you saw

275
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:05,690
Houdini is not supported that nicely

276
00:16:05,690 --> 00:16:07,220
there but imagine Houdini would be

277
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:09,440
supported like fully on all browsers now

278
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,810
we sit here and we see our conical

279
00:16:11,810 --> 00:16:15,680
gradients and we can't use it because

280
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:18,320
it's not supported anywhere it's behind

281
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:21,290
a black and chrome and nowhere else so

282
00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:27,080
what would we do we go back to our demos

283
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:33,920
and here so we just created like a

284
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:40,610
circle in our CSS and we give it a conic

285
00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:44,510
gradient just so you can see how it

286
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:47,600
works in the real CSS I got to flag

287
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:52,310
enabled and in my Chrome Canary so it

288
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:53,690
shouldn't be a problem

289
00:16:53,690 --> 00:17:04,070
we want to go from tomato to obviously

290
00:17:04,070 --> 00:17:11,090
and yeah so I'm just rendering this here

291
00:17:11,090 --> 00:17:15,020
in a conic class and if I go to my

292
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:20,960
browser we can see yeah there we have it

293
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:23,840
that's the standard CSS way that we

294
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:26,360
would go but as you saw it's not

295
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:28,760
supported anywhere so next up we want to

296
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:35,960
go for for the Houdini way and the

297
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:41,120
Houdini way would be actually to go to

298
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:44,780
JavaScript and at a paint were clad with

299
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:50,330
our worklet in it and some properties

300
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:52,430
which will be gradient started gradient

301
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:56,210
stuff they are colors they I just

302
00:17:56,210 --> 00:17:58,940
defaulted to white and black so we have

303
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:04,880
something here and yeah we just you said

304
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:08,330
it's a little bit complicated I stole

305
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:13,280
some canonical gradient stuff from the

306
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,280
internet and I tweaked it a little bit

307
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:18,170
but mainly what we are doing is we

308
00:18:18,170 --> 00:18:23,020
reduce our connect gradient class class

309
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:27,170
we get our properties into it

310
00:18:27,170 --> 00:18:31,610
we start our paint and then we register

311
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:35,180
that paint as conic gradient what's

312
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:38,810
happening here is just pretty much I'm

313
00:18:38,810 --> 00:18:44,060
taking the colors as RGB values and I

314
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:46,460
read them out I figure out what the

315
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:48,200
values are and I just transition them

316
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:50,150
from one to another because I didn't

317
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:51,830
figure out a better way to do it and

318
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:54,080
it's just for the sake of like seeing

319
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,540
how a gradient from one value to the

320
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:59,450
other would work I think there are

321
00:18:59,450 --> 00:19:01,280
better ways are just this morning I saw

322
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,140
today some implementation

323
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:06,830
connect gradient that is using Houdini

324
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:09,740
in some kind of way but it actually is

325
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:11,780
broken right now so it's not working in

326
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:13,700
the canary with all this stuff enabled

327
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:18,140
so I'm not sure but the link to it still

328
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:19,850
is in the presentation and you will get

329
00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:20,680
it later

330
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:28,280
so yeah I reduced it that I added the

331
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:30,200
properties in the HTML I added my

332
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:33,110
worklet and now in the CSS I will just

333
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:43,880
go here I will take it typing and then

334
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:46,340
you see I just added my start and stop

335
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:49,730
values for my gradient I have to use RGB

336
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:53,290
because my polyfill is not that good but

337
00:19:53,290 --> 00:19:58,940
in later versions you probably can put

338
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:02,150
in like the word tomato and hex code for

339
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:04,790
the color and it will work and then I

340
00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:07,790
just paint my conic gradient and as soon

341
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:11,870
as I save this you would see you nothing

342
00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:15,680
changed this is good because actually

343
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:21,620
now if I inspect this you will see down

344
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:24,200
here in the developer tools that now I'm

345
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,360
using background pain conic gradient

346
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:30,200
instead of the old or the they actually

347
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:33,200
conic gradient method that would be used

348
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:38,510
in CSS otherwise so what we actually did

349
00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:41,570
is we just polyfill that feature it's a

350
00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:44,480
small subset of it and it's just like a

351
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:48,650
proof of concept but it's working and we

352
00:20:48,650 --> 00:20:52,490
can use it and this is what polyfills in

353
00:20:52,490 --> 00:20:55,670
CSS could look like as soon as Houdini

354
00:20:55,670 --> 00:21:00,560
is usable across all browsers and you

355
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:03,350
can see it it's not too difficult it's

356
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:08,720
not too much code in the in the

357
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:12,800
JavaScript as you can imagine all of

358
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:15,640
this is kind of similar to the canvas or

359
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:18,370
on a canvas experiment experiments that

360
00:21:18,370 --> 00:21:21,490
you find a good part of them could

361
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:25,059
probably be usable in there and what I

362
00:21:25,059 --> 00:21:28,390
actually saw is that there are there are

363
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:32,140
efforts to actually put those properties

364
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:34,420
that I'm now defining as custom

365
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:36,370
properties and CSS actually put them

366
00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:39,790
into the paint method so I could just

367
00:21:39,790 --> 00:21:42,850
put them in here but right now it's not

368
00:21:42,850 --> 00:21:44,559
working or at least I didn't find a way

369
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:47,919
to make it work but that's something

370
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:50,350
that could happen actually and the good

371
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:54,280
thing about this is actually that if I

372
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:57,540
put the custom properties in here and

373
00:21:57,540 --> 00:21:59,429
[Music]

374
00:21:59,429 --> 00:22:04,780
duplicate that and change the properties

375
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:19,960
around in this context they are scoped

376
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:23,980
so you can actually make it work a lot

377
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:26,530
like in actual function only thing you

378
00:22:26,530 --> 00:22:29,320
have to do is not write the properties

379
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:31,720
that you need into your method but

380
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:38,080
rather next to it okay so much for the

381
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:44,049
demos I'm pretty much done this actually

382
00:22:44,049 --> 00:22:47,919
just some helpful links yes

383
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:50,260
it's very small you figure it out when

384
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:52,290
you get the presentation

385
00:22:52,290 --> 00:22:56,290
there's the CSS Houdini working group

386
00:22:56,290 --> 00:22:58,270
wiki which is really nice where they're

387
00:22:58,270 --> 00:23:00,429
just showing of what they're working on

388
00:23:00,429 --> 00:23:02,320
there's a lot of stuff that's actually

389
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,940
not Specht out and they're just thinking

390
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:06,370
about coding in there because so there's

391
00:23:06,370 --> 00:23:08,160
a lot happening and it's really

392
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:10,780
interesting to look at there's a really

393
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:12,820
nice article by Smashing Magazine which

394
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:14,860
is actually already 2 years old where I

395
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:17,559
heard about it the first time we're just

396
00:23:17,559 --> 00:23:19,480
laying out what you could do with

397
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:24,370
Houdini and what it's useful for then

398
00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:26,080
there is a really nice article by coda

399
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:28,020
block which shows

400
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:31,920
how to use the paint API and this page

401
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:34,290
were actually a lot of experiments and

402
00:23:34,290 --> 00:23:36,090
stuff are shown with Houdini and with

403
00:23:36,090 --> 00:23:41,430
some like Houdini polyfills so you can

404
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:43,650
use them more features than actually are

405
00:23:43,650 --> 00:23:46,080
supported in the browser and you can try

406
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:49,350
out what to Dean you would be helpful to

407
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:52,050
do with so I really recommend looking at

408
00:23:52,050 --> 00:23:53,370
all this stuff

409
00:23:53,370 --> 00:23:56,100
and keeping an eye on or Deenie because

410
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:58,920
it will change a lot of things it could

411
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:01,800
become dangerous but you never know in

412
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,810
the internet what people use this stuff

413
00:24:03,810 --> 00:24:07,710
for but I think it's a nice thing to be

414
00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:10,320
able to polyfill CSS and don't wait for

415
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:14,220
two years to actually get it so thank

416
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:15,800
you
