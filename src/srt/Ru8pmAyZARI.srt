consonants if they learn on a point

46
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,810

infinity or continue you spin again yeah

56
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:08,760
if you hit the pari sign instant win so

57
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:12,510
instead if anybody is 2x it just means

58
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:15,000
that whatever letter is what the more

59
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,459
points you have at a moment again we

60
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:21,390

61
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:23,160
gonna give you a topic now

62
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,290
and that topic is kind of gives you an

63
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:27,720
idea of what the words our word is that

64
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,400
we're looking for it typically a phrase

65
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:32,550
or a sentence of sorts so let's see what

66
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:37,500
the first one is yes 2018 so I hope

67
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,660
you'll read up on the new versions of

68
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:42,770
JavaScript speaking it started with that

69
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:45,240
so the buzzer in front of you lights up

70
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,250
when you can spin meaning the first

71
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:49,830
press is you like kind of reach out and

72
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:51,600
the second press is to spin the faster

73
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,790
you press the two the faster the wheel

74
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:56,070
will spin the slower you do that this

75
00:04:56,070 --> 00:05:05,640
will give it a try not twice can have

76
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:08,910
the music a little louder so now you

77
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:11,010
have a hundred so you can now choose a

78
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:13,050
letter constantly because vowels cost
