1
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:42,840

so yeah staying within the theme I think

2
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,950
JavaScript development today has a

3
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:45,910
serious problem

4
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:50,530
we generally for the most part we write

5
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:52,660
our programs in a fairly imperative

6
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:55,360
style we go global mutable staged on

7
00:00:55,360 --> 00:01:02,050
occasions object orientation and there's

8
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:03,940
a problem with that there's a very real

9
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:07,420
problem it's just too mainstream it's

10
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:12,009
not cool I mean but any self-respecting

11
00:01:12,009 --> 00:01:13,390
hipster wouldn't want to touch that

12
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:14,920
stuff but we aren't really clear on the

13
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:19,179
alternative someway I mean what kind of

14
00:01:19,179 --> 00:01:24,950
people will write codes in Si like that

15
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,389
done this thing I'm so much for

16
00:01:28,389 --> 00:01:31,929
micromedex timing and enterprise

17
00:01:31,929 --> 00:01:33,399
developers would do we want to be a

18
00:01:33,399 --> 00:01:35,439
surprise developers no we do not

19
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:38,350
so we need an even better solution for

20
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:39,969
this so we have this thing called

21
00:01:39,969 --> 00:01:41,439
functional programming and photo

22
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:43,179
programmers up in their ivory tower

23
00:01:43,179 --> 00:01:46,899
femme salons they had all these amazing

24
00:01:46,899 --> 00:01:52,270
words and concepts and things that what

25
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:55,060
you've probably never heard of math

26
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:56,819
sounds like it's a good start

27
00:01:56,819 --> 00:02:00,039
so yeah you got your closely arrows you

28
00:02:00,039 --> 00:02:02,469
got your needle um I don't know why you

29
00:02:02,469 --> 00:02:05,020
would need a lemma but there you go go

30
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:08,140
burritos we don't mention the M word and

31
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:10,300
so on I'm gonna have to pronounce the

32
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:11,590
last one now so I go history morphic

33
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:12,800
people morphisms just

34
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,560
just for kicks he I practiced so much to

35
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:18,020
be able to say that so yeah

36
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:20,750
best function but there's all this stuff

37
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:26,600
baton what what's the ease of this there

38
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,440
are things

39
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:31,070
fortunately leaking out of the world of

40
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:34,280
Haskell and whatnot into you some into

41
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,260
concepts that are more relevant to us as

42
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:38,630
JavaScript developers for one thing

43
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:39,680
there's this thing called functional

44
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,780
reactive programming and in particular

45
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:46,520
this thing called reactive extensions

46
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:49,010
made by this guy called Eric Meyer for

47
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:51,800
c-sharp originally and then started

48
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:55,250
associate spreading out into other

49
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:59,290
languages and this guy called Misaki

50
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:01,610
essentially implemented at the

51
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:04,310
JavaScript version rxjs map that doesn't

52
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:07,370
look like years old cool t-shirt that is

53
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:15,680
Eric ware who's this done I don't know

54
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,870
it looks cool probably invented

55
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:20,239
something very interesting wait is that

56
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:23,470
the guy could see the day isn't it yeah

57
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:28,730
good job anyway so rxjs is what i want

58
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:31,160
to try and use today to actually build

59
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:34,130
something real I'm just gonna be once

60
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:35,900
I'm done introducing this thing I'm

61
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:37,070
essentially just gonna be writing code

62
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:40,130
so we're gonna build again using rxjs

63
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:47,540
and originally i i thought i'd just used

64
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:49,730
the dom to render our game components

65
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:52,610
and then I saw Angelina stalker

66
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:54,520
yesterday about the canvas so I thought

67
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,720
maybe we just rewrite this year's the

68
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,400
canvas and then just now David mentioned

69
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,860
this thing called react so I figured why

70
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:02,630
not use that so I just finally I was

71
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:04,220
talking I just rewrote this had think T

72
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:07,100
these reactors are back-end that's the

73
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:10,700
live by the way that was prepared so

74
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:12,260
react was in what's been invented by

75
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:15,110
these guys and Facebook and it's

76
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:17,780
essentially um well it's it's more than

77
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:19,190
just a renderer but I'm just gonna use

78
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:21,560
the rendering pot now wait we're aney

79
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:24,160
can you construct social and immutable

80
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,770
virtual dumb and then just push that

81
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:29,870
into the current um turn out to be

82
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:34,729
Michael very easy to do so if you're

83
00:04:34,729 --> 00:04:38,500
wondering about reactive extensions is

84
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:42,259
essentially think of arrays you know

85
00:04:42,259 --> 00:04:43,759
erase in JavaScript you can map them you

86
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:45,080
can filter them we can do all these

87
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:47,990
really function things with them and in

88
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:49,550
international extensions you have this

89
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:52,430
thing called an observable which is sort

90
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:53,750
of the same thing so I would also extend

91
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:58,099
over time so what we got here is we're

92
00:04:58,099 --> 00:04:59,539
taken away and we turn it into an

93
00:04:59,539 --> 00:05:02,750
observable and I've got this helper

94
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:04,970
function here called lunk which just

95
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:07,130
prints the what comes out of the other

96
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:08,720
end of the observable this it's sort of

97
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,150
like a stream as one so if we run this

98
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:15,139
we should be getting bONIES ben is a

99
00:05:15,139 --> 00:05:21,849
cool we can map the ponies ponies map

100
00:05:21,849 --> 00:05:27,510
only

101
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:35,479
like any and then that anything is

102
00:05:35,479 --> 00:05:38,119
essentially I mean it looks just like

103
00:05:38,119 --> 00:05:41,089
mapping erase at this point of course it

104
00:05:41,089 --> 00:05:44,179
also works over time I've got this thing

105
00:05:44,179 --> 00:05:48,229
here which takes my pony observable and

106
00:05:48,229 --> 00:05:50,809
zips it together with an interval

107
00:05:50,809 --> 00:05:53,259
observable which takes every half second

108
00:05:53,259 --> 00:05:56,419
so if we love this we get one penny

109
00:05:56,419 --> 00:05:59,270
every half seconds that is two ponies a

110
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:04,639
second that's pretty good and further of

111
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:11,059
course we can also keep applying these

112
00:06:11,059 --> 00:06:14,589
functions they are still valid like say

113
00:06:14,589 --> 00:06:17,749
if we're if we put a filter on the end

114
00:06:17,749 --> 00:06:22,300
of this it's essentially going to filter

115
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:25,999
every pony as it comes in every half

116
00:06:25,999 --> 00:06:28,759
second so if we are only interested in

117
00:06:28,759 --> 00:06:33,259
bonus that and were the lesser e they

118
00:06:33,259 --> 00:06:36,919
should do the trick notice they come out

119
00:06:36,919 --> 00:06:39,110
a bit irregularly because there's only a

120
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:41,119
pony every 1/2 second but we only let

121
00:06:41,119 --> 00:06:46,069
them the coolest ponies three so we can

122
00:06:46,069 --> 00:06:47,899
go even further and we can make sure

123
00:06:47,899 --> 00:06:49,490
that everybody knows that we're number

124
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:51,050
one i Sparkle and applause pinky Bach

125
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:53,990
and the completion there at the end is

126
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:55,879
when the string is done because there

127
00:06:55,879 --> 00:06:58,669
are no more ponies so of course the the

128
00:06:58,669 --> 00:07:02,509
stream can close anyway let's write some

129
00:07:02,509 --> 00:07:07,459
code I got some code prepared already

130
00:07:07,459 --> 00:07:11,599
just very basic utility stuff like Dale

131
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:12,709
it was talking about immutable data

132
00:07:12,709 --> 00:07:13,759
structures so I made my own

133
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:16,509
implementation of the hash remap tree

134
00:07:16,509 --> 00:07:21,469
slightly so it's simplified but it is

135
00:07:21,469 --> 00:07:25,339
fairly efficient it's on4 for the SOC

136
00:07:25,339 --> 00:07:27,110
function the earth earth function will

137
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:28,610
take two objects and squish them

138
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:30,860
together using the hash array math tree

139
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:33,520
function yes this just

140
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:37,180
this isn't really a hatchery mercury but

141
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:40,810
it sounded really cool to say and I just

142
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:44,110
got a function here to to click

143
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:47,800
coordinates to rather to check if a

144
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,389
corner to sunscreen or not that's gonna

145
00:07:49,389 --> 00:07:52,090
be useful later and my bind key function

146
00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:55,659
which essentially wraps the mousetrap

147
00:07:55,659 --> 00:07:57,039
library which lets you listen to

148
00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:59,680
Keeneland and turns that into an or

149
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:07,389
extreme so if I go find key space that's

150
00:08:07,389 --> 00:08:09,729
gonna come out as a stream of spaces

151
00:08:09,729 --> 00:08:11,680
whenever I press the space key anyway

152
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:17,259
let us get on with it so what you can

153
00:08:17,259 --> 00:08:19,509
see on the right here is the sky above

154
00:08:19,509 --> 00:08:23,500
bonia middle and we also need to put

155
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,750
some ground there for our character to

156
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:29,349
run along actually we should better just

157
00:08:29,349 --> 00:08:33,729
get on with the renderer as well so the

158
00:08:33,729 --> 00:08:35,140
way i'm gonna do this is I'm gonna have

159
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:36,520
sort of a scene graph it's not really a

160
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,880
graph it's just gonna be an array of of

161
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:43,000
elements and the ground elements or all

162
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,020
elements are going to have an

163
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:48,640
x-coordinate and they are going to have

164
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:52,930
a y-coordinate they're going to have an

165
00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:55,329
idea which just is just gonna translate

166
00:08:55,329 --> 00:08:58,390
directly to Adam class and this one's

167
00:08:58,390 --> 00:09:01,060
called ground but but exciting so far

168
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:03,970
and I also got this idea of being able

169
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:10,120
to offset coordinates so if I have this

170
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:12,520
thing called base ax a minus 128 that's

171
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:14,230
always going to be added to the accident

172
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:16,029
when we render it just to make some

173
00:09:16,029 --> 00:09:20,579
calculations and it's lazy to follow and

174
00:09:20,579 --> 00:09:23,020
me going we're gonna have to write in

175
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:26,389
the round red for that first of all

176
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,930
we're going to have to have a function

177
00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:33,339
that takes a node like this and turn it

178
00:09:33,339 --> 00:09:39,300
into a react develop a

179
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:45,320
with a class name of merit ID and a

180
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:52,279
style of client left then X plus their

181
00:09:52,279 --> 00:09:54,680
base acts as I mentioned or if that

182
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:58,220
doesn't exist than zero and of course

183
00:09:58,220 --> 00:09:59,870
instead of master flow Thank You

184
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:03,830
Angelina no we just bitwise all that

185
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:12,080
with 0 and plus BX because CSS same

186
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:20,270
thing made sy was their own and that

187
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:21,620
would get that should do it

188
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:23,750
that should get us exactly the element

189
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:27,529
we need obviously that the dumb class

190
00:10:27,529 --> 00:10:30,770
has some CSS attached to it say this

191
00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:32,300
crown is gonna have a background image

192
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:35,420
that's already and then in a function to

193
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:38,600
render the whole thing it takes a list

194
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:43,520
of these notes like grant and it simply

195
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:52,480
can't react at render component with

196
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:59,990
parent 'iv with no properties and for

197
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:01,310
the second argument we just give a list

198
00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:03,940
of reacts dominates which is gonna be

199
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:07,310
children and we can just simply take

200
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:12,700
notes and map make elements and that

201
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:14,680
that should do it

202
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:18,770
so we need to only component takes the

203
00:11:18,770 --> 00:11:20,060
target that's why I don't hope you

204
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:24,080
notice I find the the elements with the

205
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,550
idea of canvas and puts it in the

206
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:30,350
converse variable so commerce and then

207
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:34,760
we should be able to give that a list of

208
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:38,660
names currently in the ground and that's

209
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:43,870
the ground thank that's the DOS

210
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:50,590
um but the ground is opposed to move so

211
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:54,580
this is why react is gonna come in handy

212
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:58,660
sorry in writing exceptions instead of

213
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:01,380
the ground object we can make a ground

214
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:04,000
stream let's just get rid of the object

215
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,170
by the way well you won't leave us any

216
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:08,970
more

217
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:12,600
but we got the rain wrong engine now and

218
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:18,970
we create an observable and every 33

219
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:21,310
milliseconds that should give us is that

220
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:28,440
30 or 60 frames it's gonna fire off an

221
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:35,890
event and when that happens it is

222
00:12:35,890 --> 00:12:37,810
actually going to be counting up from 0

223
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:42,040
to infinity every 33 milliseconds so we

224
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:45,190
can map that onto a function which takes

225
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:46,960
the ax which is going to be the number

226
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:53,170
and returns an object like this so

227
00:12:53,170 --> 00:12:54,760
you'll notice by the way I'm using es6

228
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,860
because why not we live in the future

229
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:57,420
now

230
00:12:57,420 --> 00:13:05,170
so that would be ID grant and also

231
00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:06,640
that's why that's living in the future

232
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:08,560
nobody wants to type that functional

233
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:13,360
thing on the time-base axe is at minus

234
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:20,560
128 it's 10 and X is X margin is 64

235
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:27,130
times minus 8 that's gonna keep us a

236
00:13:27,130 --> 00:13:29,530
best bets gonna make the ground scroll a

237
00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:32,200
bit until he's almost at the end of the

238
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,550
texture then it's gonna loop back and

239
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:34,990
scroll and hopefully it's gonna be

240
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:40,570
seamless why it's still 3/8 aful that

241
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:46,420
should do it of course and we are gonna

242
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:47,860
have to plug that into the rendering

243
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:52,930
engine and we can do that

244
00:13:52,930 --> 00:13:56,170
we could actually just map if the

245
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:57,730
redness in function just took a note we

246
00:13:57,730 --> 00:13:59,620
could just map that stream directly to

247
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:01,690
there an Essene function but as it takes

248
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:03,730
a list of nodes we are going to use them

249
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:07,990
all right observable zip array function

250
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:12,210
which takes any number of our extremes

251
00:14:12,210 --> 00:14:14,710
which is positron stream that's gonna

252
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:17,830
give us a list of just grab the ground

253
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:20,339
stream and that we can map directly

254
00:14:20,339 --> 00:14:25,720
entering the scene so that didn't work

255
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:26,650
at all did it

256
00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:31,800
sorry sorry sorry subscribe but

257
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:34,529
subscribe is the endpoint of a stream

258
00:14:34,529 --> 00:14:38,260
essentially it takes a function and says

259
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:39,760
that whenever this stream produces

260
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,560
output please call this function with

261
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:44,050
that athlete so it's like Matt because

262
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:47,320
that actually of course is the stream

263
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:50,580
just dr. bad that's better

264
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:54,400
are you kidding me applause for the

265
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,050
ground your mind is gonna be so clever

266
00:14:56,050 --> 00:15:00,430
when the pony shows up speaking of which

267
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:03,310
let's get the pony in because what is

268
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:07,510
the game without a pony oh we're gonna

269
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:08,890
have to make a stream for that as well

270
00:15:08,890 --> 00:15:12,910
first though we are going to you make

271
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:19,600
there's a stream that lessons for space

272
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:24,640
key presence and not just that but I'm

273
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:34,240
going to buffer that and interval that

274
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,279
is free what this is going to do is

275
00:15:36,279 --> 00:15:38,709
every 33 milliseconds it's going to give

276
00:15:38,709 --> 00:15:42,160
us an array of however - basis were

277
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:45,760
pressed during that interval so it's

278
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:48,250
gonna be like our our frame take but

279
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:50,050
it's gonna come with key events as well

280
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:57,010
and let's get there's a pinky stream

281
00:15:57,020 --> 00:16:02,560
and it's gonna be actually it would just

282
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:06,080
plug something on the tick stream you're

283
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,490
gonna use the scan function which is

284
00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:09,950
sort of like an event leave just for

285
00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:13,250
pinkie and that takes a function no

286
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:16,850
sorry it takes an initial State

287
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:18,230
this is going to be one of those need

288
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:22,510
objects alas so this was called pinky

289
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:28,220
and her base y is going to be 276 that

290
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:29,330
makes it look like she's on the ground

291
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:35,350
when y is 0 and of course x is 0 and Y

292
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:39,470
is their own and I'm just gonna add the

293
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:40,880
rest of the state we're gonna need to

294
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:43,550
her because she is going to be affected

295
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:48,380
by physics so she has an X velocity and

296
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:52,010
a Y velocity and she's also gonna have a

297
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:54,380
flag which says whether her game is over

298
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:58,640
or not if we get as far as actually

299
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:00,649
adding enemies but I'm not sure let's

300
00:17:00,649 --> 00:17:00,860
see

301
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:03,410
and that also takes a function which

302
00:17:03,410 --> 00:17:06,439
will take the previous version or pinky

303
00:17:06,439 --> 00:17:10,309
and it's gonna take the keys which is

304
00:17:10,309 --> 00:17:11,780
what comes out in the stream that we are

305
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:15,679
attached T and this is where pinkies

306
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:18,439
game loop should occur I'm gonna need a

307
00:17:18,439 --> 00:17:24,920
function that applies a velocity that's

308
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,559
gonna be generalized and this one right

309
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:31,309
we can use that velocity later and we

310
00:17:31,309 --> 00:17:33,110
use the magic as a function from my hash

311
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:37,940
remap tree library we apply nodes sorry

312
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:41,990
let's just call em and - I mean we apply

313
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:47,390
XS and X plus and the ax and likewise

314
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:55,270
for y right how'd you do it so now we

315
00:17:55,270 --> 00:18:00,320
have say P with the lost city of P

316
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,510
notice that because of the magic

317
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:05,720
immutable data structure function this

318
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:10,210
is gonna return any object and

319
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:12,980
as long as we're inside this function it

320
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:14,509
doesn't really matter if we mutate that

321
00:18:14,509 --> 00:18:16,429
object as long as it is a fresh one as

322
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:17,960
long as we don't mutate what comes out

323
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:20,269
of the function so we're just gonna be

324
00:18:20,269 --> 00:18:23,779
cheating a bit here for anything we want

325
00:18:23,779 --> 00:18:27,529
to actually just let's see if we can

326
00:18:27,529 --> 00:18:31,999
make a show up just add pinky stream to

327
00:18:31,999 --> 00:18:35,710
a zip or a down here and now hopefully

328
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:38,269
yeah we ain't got a type it should be

329
00:18:38,269 --> 00:18:47,539
capital y that's pinky and of course of

330
00:18:47,539 --> 00:18:49,989
course pinking is affected by gravity

331
00:18:49,989 --> 00:18:52,989
only because she wants to you but geez

332
00:18:52,989 --> 00:19:02,210
that's a point 98 right so oops yeah she

333
00:19:02,210 --> 00:19:04,989
needs to hit the ground and stop I think

334
00:19:04,989 --> 00:19:10,039
so if pinkies y-coordinates is greater

335
00:19:10,039 --> 00:19:13,009
than zero that will be below ground then

336
00:19:13,009 --> 00:19:19,249
please make her be at zero and make her

337
00:19:19,249 --> 00:19:23,659
stop no she's taste on the ground but

338
00:19:23,659 --> 00:19:28,070
course we want her to jump and that will

339
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:30,619
imply that if the first element of the

340
00:19:30,619 --> 00:19:34,489
keys array is space we don't care about

341
00:19:34,489 --> 00:19:36,919
the other elements you can only press

342
00:19:36,919 --> 00:19:41,419
space anyway so if we press space then

343
00:19:41,419 --> 00:19:44,539
give her an upwards velocity make her

344
00:19:44,539 --> 00:19:50,980
jump

345
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:53,870
what the that interesting I win a

346
00:19:53,870 --> 00:19:56,600
manager into fitness interfering with my

347
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:57,950
key bindings but okay

348
00:19:57,950 --> 00:20:00,890
I just had to switch focus so she jumps

349
00:20:00,890 --> 00:20:07,390
and she can also keep jumping apparently

350
00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:09,830
okay so we need to make sure that she

351
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:11,059
she's gonna come that Anna mentioned

352
00:20:11,059 --> 00:20:13,760
don't worry I mean we need to make sure

353
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,530
that she can only jump high and she's on

354
00:20:15,530 --> 00:20:17,710
the ground

355
00:20:17,710 --> 00:20:23,580
so I think just now

356
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:28,640
I'm not gonna at the color braces it's

357
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:31,540
okay for Apple so it's okay for me um

358
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:33,770
that should do it and why were assets

359
00:20:33,770 --> 00:20:37,200
actually nice had the curly braces

360
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:40,210
because I actually need to do more here

361
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:45,020
we're gonna play some sound when she

362
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:56,990
jumps they play in the jumps and I never

363
00:20:56,990 --> 00:21:00,110
say no matter how hard I press the space

364
00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:01,280
key now while she's in the air she

365
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,720
doesn't keep something so that's a good

366
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:03,170
stuff

367
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:05,960
I think that little fingers physics know

368
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:10,640
she needs something to do I thought that

369
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:18,620
I mean obviously we are already inspired

370
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:20,840
by a certain game so I thought maybe

371
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:22,040
thinking one might have collect some

372
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:27,620
coins so that adds in the coins we need

373
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:33,980
a initial coin time jack coin object ID

374
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:40,550
coin the X is minus six V is zero agus

375
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:44,240
is a thousand and Y is four C but

376
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,679
actually give us an object that is gonna

377
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:48,050
come in from off screen as a certain

378
00:21:48,050 --> 00:21:50,900
height which then pinkish a jumping

379
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:56,330
catch that sound reasonable

380
00:21:56,340 --> 00:22:00,340
so we need a string for that of course

381
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:02,500
pinky is going to affect the coin if she

382
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:03,880
touches the Colleen she's going to

383
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:06,669
collect it so well openly then is

384
00:22:06,669 --> 00:22:09,820
essentially plug the pinkest stream into

385
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:11,860
this new stream that's gonna feed

386
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:16,870
pinky's node into our coin stream so we

387
00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:21,510
can respond to it we're gonna scan again

388
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:28,240
initial value is initial coin and we're

389
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,480
gonna function that takes e4 coin and

390
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:41,529
pinky idea and quite simply is the

391
00:22:41,529 --> 00:22:46,279
velocity function to apply minus 2t and

392
00:22:46,289 --> 00:22:55,360
so if if first of all the idea is that

393
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,159
one pinky touches it we're going to send

394
00:22:57,159 --> 00:22:59,409
the coin just moving straight upwards so

395
00:22:59,409 --> 00:23:01,690
we can use the velocity to detect if it

396
00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:03,970
has been caught or not if it's zero it's

397
00:23:03,970 --> 00:23:06,580
okay and I got this magic function that

398
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:09,159
I didn't show you which is just a bit of

399
00:23:09,159 --> 00:23:12,520
math which can let us know if two nodes

400
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:15,340
intersect with each with each other so

401
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:18,940
this will be true when pinky touches the

402
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:21,730
coin of course we need to place a trim

403
00:23:21,730 --> 00:23:26,200
sound coin mp3 can you guess what that

404
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:32,620
is gonna sound like and when that

405
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:34,440
happens we are going to stop the

406
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:38,110
horizontal movement and we are going to

407
00:23:38,110 --> 00:23:41,640
send that thing as going upwards and

408
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:48,760
moreover huh I'm missing a watch oh god

409
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,640
yes thank you

410
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:54,119
pair programming yay

411
00:23:54,119 --> 00:23:57,959
okay so if it is moving upwards in fact

412
00:23:57,959 --> 00:24:02,279
we want to increase the velocity so it

413
00:24:02,279 --> 00:24:13,789
goes faster and faster upwards and again

414
00:24:13,789 --> 00:24:23,659
okay and it's them all okay finally and

415
00:24:23,659 --> 00:24:26,009
remember the on-screen function this is

416
00:24:26,009 --> 00:24:27,959
why we're gonna need that because when

417
00:24:27,959 --> 00:24:30,079
the coin goes too far arms off-screen

418
00:24:30,079 --> 00:24:33,269
upwards we just reset it or if you fail

419
00:24:33,269 --> 00:24:35,069
to catch it and then goes up screen to

420
00:24:35,069 --> 00:24:40,409
the left then we also reset it so the

421
00:24:40,409 --> 00:24:43,649
cysts of screen on screens are in then

422
00:24:43,649 --> 00:24:47,489
we just return see otherwise we go back

423
00:24:47,489 --> 00:24:51,749
to the initial state and of course the

424
00:24:51,749 --> 00:24:54,089
initial state is not mutated because we

425
00:24:54,089 --> 00:24:56,339
aren't crazy we use the immutable data

426
00:24:56,339 --> 00:25:00,149
structures now so let's see we need to

427
00:25:00,149 --> 00:25:05,669
also add the coin to our rendering

428
00:25:05,669 --> 00:25:09,959
stream and see if the coin shows up and

429
00:25:09,959 --> 00:25:11,969
if I can manage to catch it well that's

430
00:25:11,969 --> 00:25:20,760
a coin it's a - going and icon says

431
00:25:20,770 --> 00:25:29,020
oh yeah that was handy that was all

432
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:33,610
my work done but fortunately I happen to

433
00:25:33,610 --> 00:25:36,240
how much it's night in case the puppets

434
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:39,340
say what I'm going to do you or exactly

435
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:45,279
my coat no it should be on top when I'm

436
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:49,539
looking for yes because I wasn't gonna

437
00:25:49,539 --> 00:25:52,720
add a hang time and that as you can see

438
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,120
is that much good so I'm gonna just

439
00:25:54,120 --> 00:26:00,100
rewrite that however this is gonna be

440
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:03,580
too time-consuming to remain I'm just

441
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:04,750
gonna explain the Dutch words but I'm

442
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:09,010
gonna add the hater stream much like the

443
00:26:09,010 --> 00:26:14,740
coin because you know us brainless we

444
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:16,690
are quite frequently bothered my haters

445
00:26:16,690 --> 00:26:18,220
on the internet so I thought I hate it

446
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:22,970
would be a good enemy

447
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:25,390
some people feel threatened by paintings

448
00:26:25,390 --> 00:26:29,799
I painted me with eight pixels to the

449
00:26:29,799 --> 00:26:38,590
left and all of this turns out that's a

450
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:42,399
thousand of screen while 300 is gonna

451
00:26:42,399 --> 00:26:48,260
have a it sort of on the ground action

452
00:26:48,270 --> 00:26:51,429
d7 anything semicolon just in case it

453
00:26:51,429 --> 00:26:55,179
was cooked when it finds out and data

454
00:26:55,179 --> 00:27:02,260
stream hey turn stream sort of the same

455
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:07,480
as pinky every tick

456
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:11,649
starting with the initial hater H and

457
00:27:11,649 --> 00:27:12,789
Keith

458
00:27:12,789 --> 00:27:14,620
it doesn't actually increase we can take

459
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:17,200
that out because it's a static type

460
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:23,100
checking you're crazy and the H is

461
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:28,120
velocity of H as previously and just

462
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:31,630
like coin if they hate it goes off

463
00:27:31,630 --> 00:27:38,519
screen it really stops initial time

464
00:27:38,519 --> 00:27:42,220
right I'm just gonna need to take up

465
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:51,580
something else down here this bit but

466
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:53,610
notice what I've done up here though

467
00:27:53,610 --> 00:27:56,769
instead of just subscribing to tick for

468
00:27:56,769 --> 00:27:59,769
for pinky I sip tick and the haters tree

469
00:27:59,769 --> 00:28:01,419
together because pinky responds to the

470
00:28:01,419 --> 00:28:03,130
hater stream the hater is completely

471
00:28:03,130 --> 00:28:04,690
unaffected by pinky but if pink it

472
00:28:04,690 --> 00:28:06,190
touches the hater game over

473
00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:08,529
so I have squished these two streams

474
00:28:08,529 --> 00:28:13,389
together and because of a year six what

475
00:28:13,389 --> 00:28:16,570
comes in is an array of keys as before

476
00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:19,659
and the hater so we are doing D

477
00:28:19,659 --> 00:28:22,809
structuring here because we can now in

478
00:28:22,809 --> 00:28:26,080
the future let's see that even runs it

479
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:29,049
doesn't expected as much C is not

480
00:28:29,049 --> 00:28:29,500
defined

481
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:32,649
I asked see up here it should be age for

482
00:28:32,649 --> 00:28:38,010
hater not see for coin thank you guys

483
00:28:38,010 --> 00:28:45,250
okay there's a hater

484
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:47,640
see I have two minutes left I'm actually

485
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:50,790
just gonna because now of course she

486
00:28:50,790 --> 00:28:56,520
doesn't die but I'm just going to paste

487
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:57,960
this back you don't have to apologize

488
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,880
I'm gonna try and briefly explain it but

489
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,470
we are running out of time so

490
00:29:01,470 --> 00:29:03,030
essentially the same thing if pinky and

491
00:29:03,030 --> 00:29:07,290
a hater touches touch and we are not in

492
00:29:07,290 --> 00:29:09,980
game over yet then go to game another

493
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:13,020
move pinky to the game of a class which

494
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:15,300
gives her a different animation play the

495
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:18,930
game of a sound and send her going

496
00:29:18,930 --> 00:29:23,070
upwards and if we are in game about we

497
00:29:23,070 --> 00:29:26,340
she's just gonna like go whoa like Mario

498
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:28,770
does lunch when he dies

499
00:29:28,770 --> 00:29:32,490
so instead of applying regular gravity

500
00:29:32,490 --> 00:29:37,620
he we apply half gravity because was so

501
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:45,150
I just play the game over hater he says

502
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:48,810
where's the Queen that's a cotton this

503
00:29:48,810 --> 00:30:00,360
is gonna be a tricky job

504
00:30:00,370 --> 00:30:02,809
and now ladies and gentlemen that was a

505
00:30:02,809 --> 00:30:04,850
game using reactive extensions and a

506
00:30:04,850 --> 00:30:07,250
little bit of react because everything

507
00:30:07,250 --> 00:30:08,900
is starting with those five letters is

508
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:11,980
awesome and you need to start using it

509
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:17,390
so and I'm not gonna be able to match

510
00:30:17,390 --> 00:30:20,630
Angelina but I did as well as I could so
