right um so Cassandra how did you get

11
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:19,180

12
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:22,540
did that but yeah you know God up steer

13
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:25,000
and a JS cog I i went to note bots

14
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,880
during the the thursday and i'd heard of

15
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:29,170
Johnny Five but I hadn't like done

16
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:31,690
anything and so then they handed me an

17
00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:33,340
arduino uno with the with the with the

00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:39,430
about everything and and I was hooked I

20
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:41,710
built something I built an RGB LED that

21
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:43,720
you could control with with Wi-Fi or

22
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:46,180
with a web page and that was it that

23
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:47,680
that's how I got started so who's you

24
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,049

00:01:50,049 --> 00:01:52,150
hear if it is your hand if you've got a

26
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:54,549
spark or in fact raise your spark court

27
00:01:54,549 --> 00:01:57,250
you have your sparkle raise your hand if

28
00:01:57,250 --> 00:02:06,280

yeah who hears use Johnny Five before or

32
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:19,830

33
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:21,270
right that's awesome thank you you're in

34
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:24,090
the right place yeah how many of you are

35
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:29,570
signed up for four node bots or IRL

36
00:02:29,570 --> 00:02:34,410
tomorrow so Charles it snowed bot snowed

37
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:38,370

38
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:39,690
right so its most of you those of you

39
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:41,700
who are going kayaking all right we're

40
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,920
doing the Segway whatever signals if you

41
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:48,090
have fun this is fun for a lifetime yeah

42
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:52,550
I mean once in a lifetime experience Shh

43
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:56,300
lifetime experience so first get started

44
00:02:56,300 --> 00:03:05,550
so it was I I like these things and they

45
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:07,410
were fun but I'm really bad at see who

46
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:11,070
hears bad at sea so knows any see it all

47
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:12,060
raise your hand if you know any see at

48
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:17,460
all so you're all badass see I got it I

49
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:20,760
don't think so and that was me I was bad

50
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:23,850
at yeah but javascript was fun and oddly

51
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:26,870
enough parsing midi was fun and uh

52
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:29,010
that's what they owed is fine and no

53
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:31,170
doubt a fun trip is sniff and so these

54
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:33,120
this brought my worlds together and it

55
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,000
was great yay what about you what about

56
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,190
me she got started hi um so so I to do

57
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:44,550
robots once upon a time uh and then I

58
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:49,520
left because I see very well um and

59
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,959
actually also yeah it just got

60
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:54,270
complicated and then this guy decided to

61
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:56,640
go on stage with like his little little

62
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,980
cute little robot for the like like ran

63
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:02,780
around on a on a stage I was like whoa

64
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:06,959
but it's dumb like dum dum in a sense I

65
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:09,239
didn't have any actual like knowledge of

66
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:11,850
its environment so I was like okay time

67
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:13,940
to bring in some real robot like

68
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:19,230
knowledge into this yeah you can see

69
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:21,750
where we're was looking it could see

70
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:25,400
where it should not go yeah

71
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:28,860
so so yeah so I that's that's how i got

72
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:31,740
into node bots specifically but I've

73
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:34,259
always done the bots she's so humble it

74
00:04:34,259 --> 00:04:35,699
turns out Raquel is what actually

75
00:04:35,699 --> 00:04:37,770
legitimizes this entire movement she's

76
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:39,750
the sole purpose that there's any

77
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:47,090
legitimacy here what was it the NASA JPL

78
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:53,460
yeah yep yes high-five up here I got

79
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:56,610
started because of Chris Williams cuz he

80
00:04:56,610 --> 00:04:58,889
wrote notes serial port and I was like

81
00:04:58,889 --> 00:05:02,550
that looks like fun i could control real

82
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:10,380
world things with javascript know and

83
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:13,830
now I I laugh at the scoffing see that's

84
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:18,750
a circle laughter and then I created

85
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:21,750
Johnny Five sometime after that and then

86
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:25,050
we build things and I don't want to take

87
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:27,030
all the credit for that anymore because

88
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:29,639
so many people are I have their arts I

89
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:32,490
believe like 59 contributors to the

90
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:36,120
Johnny Five repo now like how a lot of

91
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,680
them are here actually if you've ever

92
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,710
had a commit landed in Johnny fly of

93
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:43,860
raise your hand yeah wait where y'all

94
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:46,889
are they all have rooms they're all like

95
00:05:46,889 --> 00:05:50,430
napkins great fantastic I want to snack

96
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:55,650
well you get a snack later so how about

97
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:57,960
we do some demos yeah let's demo all

98
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:00,210
right so who wants to see some demos you

99
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:01,979
hate demos you don't want to see demos

100
00:06:01,979 --> 00:06:04,380
we're gonna force you to watch demos I'm

101
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:08,669
a service cassandra has i think ok so

102
00:06:08,669 --> 00:06:11,490
you ok demo let's also remember she

103
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:15,599
started a year ago right and and and

104
00:06:15,599 --> 00:06:17,219
this is what this is what happens when

105
00:06:17,219 --> 00:06:21,300
you go to the j sirl thing tomorrow and

106
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:28,199
then keep playing around UT to this so

107
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:31,800
um thanks what this is is a it's

108
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,870
controlled by NS burrito which was a

109
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:35,279
microcontroller that was kick-started

110
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:37,110
last year and it's running a modified

111
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:38,610
JavaScript interpreter

112
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:40,469
so this whole entire dress is in

113
00:06:40,469 --> 00:06:45,629
JavaScript um yeah no um there are 56

114
00:06:45,629 --> 00:06:48,449
RGB LEDs they are Adafruit neopixels

115
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:50,520
version 2 there's an accelerometer in

116
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:57,309
the bottom of the skirt so hold on

117
00:06:57,319 --> 00:06:59,580
they're basically on a set time out to

118
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:01,949
add new lights and when I when the

119
00:07:01,949 --> 00:07:03,180
accelerometer moves that timeout

120
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:04,710
decreases so basically more of them

121
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:06,539
light up when I move around there's also

122
00:07:06,539 --> 00:07:09,090
a photocell on my on my collar I noticed

123
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:11,189
when the lights got dark this is

124
00:07:11,189 --> 00:07:14,759
blindingly bright so what I did was I I

125
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:16,050
told the photocell okay when it's when

126
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:17,520
it's darker make the lights a little

127
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,919
dimmer so it's not you know blinding

128
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:22,650
yeah that's that's my demo so oh yeah

129
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:25,680
don't trip over something oh so it turns

130
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,210
off if there's too much there's too much

131
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:29,159
light yes they actually got the writer

132
00:07:29,159 --> 00:07:30,509
if it's lighter because then you can see

133
00:07:30,509 --> 00:07:32,550
the lights Oh stay away from that thing

134
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:34,710
that almost tripping Christ Oh anything

135
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:37,740
that is not encouraged oh I'm wearing

136
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:39,900
like flat shoes because I tried to twirl

137
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:41,669
in my hotel room in heels and it turns

138
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:45,210
out can't do it oh good thing I tried

139
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:47,610
that um but yeah that's that's my demo I

140
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:52,259
think all right awesome all right uh do

141
00:07:52,259 --> 00:07:54,419
you have a demo hi I have a beginning of

142
00:07:54,419 --> 00:07:56,759
a demo so you might notice your spark or

143
00:07:56,759 --> 00:07:59,219
doing this so the Wi-Fi over here in the

144
00:07:59,219 --> 00:08:00,839
main hall is actually I find out not the

145
00:08:00,839 --> 00:08:02,370
same Wi-Fi we have over the robot room

146
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:04,949
tomorrow over there they took the they

147
00:08:04,949 --> 00:08:06,750
thought a lot of things they thought of

148
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:08,460
all these little Wi-Fi devices so we

149
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:09,870
should have better luck over there but i

150
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:12,000
recommend you play with it in your hotel

151
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,469
room later well yes okay play with

152
00:08:16,469 --> 00:08:18,180
eating your hotel room oh that thing

153
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:19,500

00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:22,319
um so get him get him online get him

155
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:23,939

00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:55,829
normal node bot see things by the way

183
00:09:55,829 --> 00:10:20,859
controlling eat controlling both feet

184
00:10:20,869 --> 00:10:23,579
there we go sometimes up down on the

185
00:10:23,579 --> 00:10:29,009
floor like what angle a certain thing is

186
00:10:29,009 --> 00:10:32,730
it and you know like a little notepad

187
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:34,740
you know like as I'm taking measurements

188
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:37,410
so in order to figure that out I got

189
00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:39,689
sick of looking up at the laptop what's

190
00:10:39,689 --> 00:10:44,670
going on controlling both feet left foot

191
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:46,709
is at the agrees right foot is that

192
00:10:46,709 --> 00:10:51,389
degrees but it just says degrees hold on

193
00:10:51,389 --> 00:10:56,910
a second hold on a second hold on he's

194
00:10:56,910 --> 00:11:03,639
fainting it can't take the pressure Oh

195
00:11:03,649 --> 00:11:05,910
robots they're not that smart they're

196
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:07,980
only as smart is and this is why the

197
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:21,220
robot revolution will never happen yeah

198
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:24,569
laughed hip roll is a degrees right hip

199
00:11:24,569 --> 00:11:28,499
roll is that degrees it just says

200
00:11:28,499 --> 00:11:34,150
degrees there's no actual number there

201
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:38,620
roll back your git commit yeah

202
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:44,880
so what I don't know okay o0 planning so

203
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,170
one second I told you we were doing this

204
00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:52,420
yeah I know but just skip to the fun

205
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:59,440
thing let's get to the geez just do your

206
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:03,460
move this table is not not leveled wow

207
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:06,040
that's a bummer anyway if it was a level

208
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,810
table it would have done an arabesque on

209
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:11,770
its own and balanced can everybody see

210
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:15,460
what's actually going on here do you see

211
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:17,380
I mean the table is at least enough

212
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:21,040
level in the front there that this is

213
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:26,320
holding itself up the amount of power

214
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:30,190
required is it's significantly more than

215
00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:31,570
any that you guys would be working with

216
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:34,540
over you know tomorrow or probably any

217
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:38,650
time soon but also what goes into this

218
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:42,450
is a whole lot of immaculate it's dead

219
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:46,170
is a lot of they're ready for this

220
00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:49,960
javascript animation so i give this

221
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:53,140
whole talk at empire j/s a couple weeks

222
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:57,750
ago where I basically drew the I

223
00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:00,310
basically brought out the similarities

224
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:02,640
and showed a couple of examples of

225
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:05,710
JavaScript animations and all this is is

226
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:08,110
is animating but we're just animating up

227
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:10,600
the properties of a servo of a thing

228
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:13,000
physical space right we're just saying

229
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,190
well I want to move the where it's

230
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:16,990
pointing from 0 to 180 which is

231
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:19,540
literally no different from moving a div

232
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:22,270
across the screen from like left 02 left

233
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:25,810
180 in animating so I actually want to

234
00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:30,120
introduce where is he Donovan where are

235
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:33,220
ya this gentleman right here has been

236
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:35,500
diligently working on a whole new

237
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:38,440
feature for Johnny Five specifically for

238
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:40,660
the servo class it's going to be a

239
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:42,850
built-in animation system so you can

240
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:47,290
actually apply like you know animation

241
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:49,930
algorithms like easing ease out sort of

242
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:51,640
things to the motion and move

243
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:53,890
of the servo which allow you to

244
00:13:53,890 --> 00:13:58,570
basically control any kind of motion or

245
00:13:58,570 --> 00:14:02,110
movement Donovan actually is doing this

246
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:05,620
while working on a Quadra pet I don't

247
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:08,020
know if we have time for you to you can

248
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:09,760
hold it up or something you got it over

249
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:12,340
there so he's programming this also with

250
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:15,340
Johnny Five just these are all built

251
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:18,490
with just Johnny Five and JavaScript and

252
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:21,190
it snowed this this can be Wireless it's

253
00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:25,720
got on board support for XP radios we've

254
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:28,030
got it wired so you know so I don't have

255
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:30,580
demo fail you see how well that worked

256
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:35,410
out you guys could probably harass him

257
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:38,050
over the next day or two to show you in

258
00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:40,230
more detail I'm really excited because

259
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:43,710
he's abstracted the whole notion of like

260
00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:47,530
timing and and calculating frames per

261
00:14:47,530 --> 00:14:49,240
second and everything you need to

262
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:51,250
actually get really really smooth servo

263
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:53,410
animations it's all like baked ins or

264
00:14:53,410 --> 00:14:56,460
it's still continuing down Johnny fives

265
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:59,650
a long-term goal of just providing the

266
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:01,540
best possible primitives for you to

267
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:04,990
build amazing things whatever your heart

268
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:08,230
desires hopefully with in addition to

269
00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:11,140
that is not the monster board the moment

270
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:13,800
except I do have a Intel Galileo with me

271
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:17,920
Johnny Five can now control any board

272
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:21,100
you want it to control the introduction

273
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:24,250
of the IO plug-in system I was gonna get

274
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:26,860
one on boards you can run on a Raspberry

275
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:30,430
Pi on a BeagleBone on anything that has

276
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:32,050
an IO plugin written for it if you have

277
00:15:32,050 --> 00:15:33,760
a board that you want to control and use

278
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:37,870
the Johnny Five API come see me will

279
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:39,880
build an IO plugin together why not

280
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,770
it'll be awesome i'm told very soon the

281
00:15:41,770 --> 00:15:43,810
Pinocchio Pinocchio already has one

282
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:46,870
there yep no key oh yes spark there's

283
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:49,630
one for that too got it all awesome

284
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:53,740
that's all I'd say okay alright so okay

285
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:58,060
thank you I'll to our demos

286
00:15:58,070 --> 00:16:02,850
you go okay did you want to do you want

287
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:04,560
to demo your sharkman I was gonna live

288
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,930
demo a shark fish I made this during the

289
00:16:06,930 --> 00:16:10,530
talk earlier because I saw shark and I

290
00:16:10,530 --> 00:16:12,180
just wanted to show how easy was to

291
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:14,490
throw together a sure hopefully by the

292
00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:16,290
end we'll have a robot shark that maybe

293
00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:18,270
node boats or node rockets to deal with

294
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:21,840
some gnarly terrorize there are sharks

295
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:25,200
here they do swim in the ocean and they

296
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:40,120
are aware of amelia island alright

297
00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:42,780
alright alright so so okay this isn't

298
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:44,640
for question it's time for questions so

299
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:48,420
okay I went ahead and asked a bunch of

300
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:50,130
people on the internet what questions

301
00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:51,990
you might have for this I have some of

302
00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:54,930
those questions here I think y'all might

303
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:56,160
have some also really interesting

304
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,990
questions but I want to get like past a

305
00:16:57,990 --> 00:17:02,520
couple of the more common ones I like I

306
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:06,060
want interesting questions so the

307
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:08,480
question like how do I get started and

308
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,860
go online there are lots of options

309
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:13,140
bubble blah like get a spark from the

310
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:15,450
vendor's kit and just start playing with

311
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:21,420
johnny five documented yes um yes also

312
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:25,830
asked us um let's see how many know

313
00:17:25,830 --> 00:17:27,140
about Stu I need to take over the world

314
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:33,900
just one forty to forty two servos 42

315
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:38,490
sir yes 42 robots each having 42 servos

316
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:40,710
I'm not gonna answer this question yeah

317
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:42,240
you need that to a self-replicating

318
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,940
robot with have a good as many printers

319
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:46,560
repairing 3d printers in the other room

320
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:50,720
we're close yeah so that's cool uh

321
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:54,350
somebody asked questions for the robots

322
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:57,630
well so somebody wanted to know if if

323
00:17:57,630 --> 00:17:59,790
their caretakers take good care of them

324
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:01,560
what's it like doing a lot of work for

325
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:03,800
people and how are you feeling overall

326
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:06,840
so one of the first rules of node boxes

327
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:10,029
don't build evil robots yeah

328
00:18:10,029 --> 00:18:17,649
she peppery you have no actual last name

329
00:18:17,649 --> 00:18:20,480
good talk robots cough last year we're

330
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,460
basically if we don't build evil robots

331
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:24,799
there won't be evil robots seems like a

332
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:26,899
pretty solid well if you think maybe I

333
00:18:26,899 --> 00:18:30,799
can feel then don't be and and they

334
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:32,240
won't want to overthrow you and they'll

335
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:35,330
just want to help us and so also to be

336
00:18:35,330 --> 00:18:37,159
fair there's there's kind of an

337
00:18:37,159 --> 00:18:38,210
application for this question of like

338
00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:39,440
how to travel with robots because

339
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,549
there's something I've got the law is

340
00:18:40,549 --> 00:18:42,769
how do how do you travel with like

341
00:18:42,769 --> 00:18:45,100
especially with like this um obviously a

342
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:47,389
TSA agent may look at this and think

343
00:18:47,389 --> 00:18:50,029
what is going on um so one way you can

344
00:18:50,029 --> 00:18:51,230
take care of your robots especially if

345
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:53,690
you're checking your bag put a copy of

346
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:55,639
make magazine in your checked bag with

347
00:18:55,639 --> 00:18:57,649
your stuff apparently this kind of makes

348
00:18:57,649 --> 00:18:59,269
it see a TSA agent if they inspect your

349
00:18:59,269 --> 00:19:01,789
bag kind of go Oh maker got it the other

350
00:19:01,789 --> 00:19:04,100
thing I did I left a letter in my bag

351
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:05,899
saying hello TSA agent here's everything

352
00:19:05,899 --> 00:19:07,549
in my bag it's clearly labeled please

353
00:19:07,549 --> 00:19:09,200
don't cut anything please don't take

354
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,360
anything and I actually did get a letter

355
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,710
when I got here saying that they had

356
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:14,000
gone through my bag and luckily

357
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,159
everything was okay I nearly had like a

358
00:19:16,159 --> 00:19:17,510
heart attack when I opened my bag and

359
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:20,870
saw the inspection letters but yeah when

360
00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:21,919
you're traveling take care of your

361
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:23,830
robots by labeling them clearly and

362
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:26,409
being very careful in packing them

363
00:19:26,409 --> 00:19:31,639
excellent I always carry printouts of

364
00:19:31,639 --> 00:19:35,389
the T essays various what can go and

365
00:19:35,389 --> 00:19:36,710
carry on and what can go and check

366
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:39,139
luggage so the check luggage list goes

367
00:19:39,139 --> 00:19:40,940
in the check luggage so it says all of

368
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:42,830
these things you might find in here it's

369
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:44,750
possible that's like tools put tools in

370
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:47,029
your check luggage or else they'll take

371
00:19:47,029 --> 00:19:49,220
them away from you trust me they will

372
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:54,720
take them away from you

373
00:19:54,730 --> 00:19:59,020
sounds like it is indeed um with the

374
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:01,960
carry-on stuff you actually I've never

375
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,850
had a problem they've looked at it

376
00:20:03,850 --> 00:20:04,960
they've opened it up kind of poked

377
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,220
around and they're like oh I see it's

378
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:08,770
just hardware interesting electronics

379
00:20:08,770 --> 00:20:11,110
great whatever on your way um I actually

380
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:13,059
had problems with batteries yes that's

381
00:20:13,059 --> 00:20:14,410
what I was about to get 20 there are

382
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:16,059
interesting rules about batteries

383
00:20:16,059 --> 00:20:21,299
batteries that are are active like

384
00:20:21,299 --> 00:20:24,490
lithium polymer you know like it's a gel

385
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:26,049
inside right you got to bring that and

386
00:20:26,049 --> 00:20:27,760
carry on because it's pressurized in the

387
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:30,010
cabin it's not pressurized where your

388
00:20:30,010 --> 00:20:32,320
luggage goes right see what could happen

389
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:35,919
their problems you can put regular nicad

390
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:38,700
and and I what's the other one nine volt

391
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:41,169
yeah nickel metal hydride batteries in

392
00:20:41,169 --> 00:20:43,390
your checked but why Polly goes in your

393
00:20:43,390 --> 00:20:56,710
carry-on always yes yep home depot yep

394
00:20:56,710 --> 00:21:13,470
that too yeah so let's see what else um

395
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,620
once I'm done burning up LEDs and

396
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:16,880
spinning motors what are some

397
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,290
approachable resources for learning the

398
00:21:18,290 --> 00:21:20,150
rest of electrical theory without having

399
00:21:20,150 --> 00:21:21,530
to pick up discrete algebra and Greek

400
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:24,950
along the way I think that's actually a

401
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:28,310
really good question uh you could just

402
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:31,100
go and get a masters in robotics um

403
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:33,340
don't have to you don't have to though

404
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:36,770
there are lots there are lots of good

405
00:21:36,770 --> 00:21:39,140
beginner books sure there's a circuits

406
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:41,330
for dummies it yes yeah getting started

407
00:21:41,330 --> 00:21:43,160
in electronics which was made the first

408
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:45,260
edition was like 1970 they used to sell

409
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:47,900
out at every radio shack electricity

410
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:50,390
doesn't change yeah you know most of

411
00:21:50,390 --> 00:21:52,130
these components that we're using today

412
00:21:52,130 --> 00:21:54,170
are the same as they've been for many

413
00:21:54,170 --> 00:21:58,160
many years and it's pretty good the one

414
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:00,110
from the one from make the the magazine

415
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:01,370
company they haven't getting started

416
00:22:01,370 --> 00:22:02,390
with electronics with lots of pictures

417
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:05,060
great for people like me and yeah so

418
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:06,950
their book is actually also really good

419
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:08,450
and it doesn't get too deep into the

420
00:22:08,450 --> 00:22:10,130
math or Greek letters or anything like

421
00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:13,070
that there's like two formulas you're

422
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:14,630
going to need for tomorrow and they're

423
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:16,070
both very there they're like three

424
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:18,080
letters so there's a question on here

425
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,300
that I'm going to ask it i'm going to

426
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:23,030
ask raquel to answer it what makes it a

427
00:22:23,030 --> 00:22:25,490
robot not just some programmed hardware

428
00:22:25,490 --> 00:22:28,730
oh that's an excellent question yeah um

429
00:22:28,730 --> 00:22:31,040
so what's the difference between a robot

430
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:33,950
and just some programmed hardware to me

431
00:22:33,950 --> 00:22:37,010
a robot depending on it like so you ask

432
00:22:37,010 --> 00:22:39,530
five roboticists what the definition of

433
00:22:39,530 --> 00:22:41,480
robot is and you'll get five different

434
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:46,130
answers I personally like the if it if

435
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:48,650
it understands instructions and acts on

436
00:22:48,650 --> 00:22:50,450
them then it is a robot which means that

437
00:22:50,450 --> 00:22:53,210
some programmed hardware is still a

438
00:22:53,210 --> 00:22:57,680
robot but to me the coolest robots are

439
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:59,360
ones that make interesting decisions by

440
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,580
themselves given certain types of input

441
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:04,100
I like autonomous robots because they

442
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:05,810
can say oh what's going on in the world

443
00:23:05,810 --> 00:23:07,910
around me based on that information what

444
00:23:07,910 --> 00:23:10,820
am I going to do next that's a cool

445
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:15,500
robot otherwise program harbor yeah

446
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:17,930
that's cool too i do that we all do that

447
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:21,820
well program Tyler's question as well

448
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:25,159
okay I just say the definition of what a

449
00:23:25,159 --> 00:23:29,149
node bot is is any program hardware that

450
00:23:29,149 --> 00:23:32,450
runs nodejs so so note bots is sort of

451
00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:34,429
the big old kachel for all of us

452
00:23:34,429 --> 00:23:35,539
learning experimenting and doing

453
00:23:35,539 --> 00:23:37,549
whatever the hell you want with it so

454
00:23:37,549 --> 00:23:40,580
don't don't sweat it yeah absolutely so

455
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:42,919
um okay I think we're just about done

456
00:23:42,919 --> 00:23:44,690
but if anybody has a really interesting

457
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:47,809
question and i'm talking like cool like

458
00:23:47,809 --> 00:23:50,330
not not like oh where do i go get

459
00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:52,549
something to buy on the internet that

460
00:23:52,549 --> 00:23:54,440
way yeah you can ask those later but

461
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:57,649
like I mean like a really interesting

462
00:23:57,649 --> 00:24:10,940
question no no yes in the back I know

463
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:13,070
what I want to do I wants worms I want

464
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:14,240
the mesh I just learned about the

465
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,620
Pinocchio it's a little power mesh

466
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:18,320
network it's not Wi-Fi it's everything

467
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,909
and their self healing and they talk in

468
00:24:19,909 --> 00:24:22,010
addressing it just everything I want out

469
00:24:22,010 --> 00:24:23,240
of a mesh network and I won't lost them

470
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:24,559
I want to know where they all are and I

471
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:26,029
want them to all do cool things that's

472
00:24:26,029 --> 00:24:27,409
whether they're flying or walking or

473
00:24:27,409 --> 00:24:29,440
crawling or just happen to be on people

474
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,539
look I think I think with the things we

475
00:24:32,539 --> 00:24:34,370
could do with a low power mesh is just

476
00:24:34,370 --> 00:24:36,740
and and you know you don't need to build

477
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:42,110
a server for freaking everything also

478
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:45,049
and I what I wouldn't see built in three

479
00:24:45,049 --> 00:24:47,419
years isn't just robots at the stronger

480
00:24:47,419 --> 00:24:49,519
community so I try to I try to kind of

481
00:24:49,519 --> 00:24:51,769
say this everywhere I go with robots um

482
00:24:51,769 --> 00:24:54,080
document your builds all of them like we

483
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,340
definitely wanna see what you're making

484
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:57,230
um if you build something awesome in

485
00:24:57,230 --> 00:24:58,429
three years that's cool but we want to

486
00:24:58,429 --> 00:25:00,470
see it so document your builds and I

487
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:01,760
want to see a stronger community and

488
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:02,899
tons of documentation in three years

489
00:25:02,899 --> 00:25:04,820
about mesh networks in Pinocchio and

490
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:07,010
that's really scary actually to me like

491
00:25:07,010 --> 00:25:09,230
the Met the best Pinocchio like I just

492
00:25:09,230 --> 00:25:14,419
yeah yeah I think I really want to see

493
00:25:14,419 --> 00:25:16,760
more computer vision type stuff and

494
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:19,880
right now there is a port for open CD in

495
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:22,909
in JavaScript it's really

496
00:25:22,909 --> 00:25:25,159
counterintuitive and difficult like I

497
00:25:25,159 --> 00:25:26,750
want it I want to just press play I just

498
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:30,409
want to NPM install blah and have it

499
00:25:30,409 --> 00:25:32,870
like in my computer everything done I

500
00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:34,789
don't want to have to build things on

501
00:25:34,789 --> 00:25:35,590
top of it

502
00:25:35,590 --> 00:25:39,470
and then start playing with opencv and

503
00:25:39,470 --> 00:25:41,930
really making cool like making the

504
00:25:41,930 --> 00:25:44,120
robots figure out how to like if I could

505
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:47,240
make my own rumba with with JavaScript

506
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:49,640
like proper with slam which is

507
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:51,050
simultaneous localization and mapping

508
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:55,310
and that would be awesome they wouldn't

509
00:25:55,310 --> 00:26:00,170
run into you exactly and clean my house

510
00:26:00,170 --> 00:26:03,950
I don't know three years you want a

511
00:26:03,950 --> 00:26:05,570
robot clean your house we don't really

512
00:26:05,570 --> 00:26:08,720
get it there runs java script yeah I've

513
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:11,030
the whole point of robots is for them to

514
00:26:11,030 --> 00:26:12,830
do things for me that I don't want the

515
00:26:12,830 --> 00:26:17,540
do myself that's the whole point I can

516
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:22,520
do that don't tempt me dangerous don't

517
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:24,320
what do you wanted you in three yeah

518
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,660
what do you want to see robots in three

519
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:28,490
years I want an apology from the

520
00:26:28,490 --> 00:26:38,300
scoffers that's all hahaha all right

521
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:39,680
first I think that's a that's all the

522
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:44,690
time we have uh but thank you q outgoing
