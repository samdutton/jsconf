it's amazing how many people you get to

5
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:49,610
know over the years and this is kind of

6
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:52,790
like a family reunion where you get to

7
00:00:52,790 --> 00:01:02,839
see everyone I didn't know that there

8
00:01:02,839 --> 00:01:05,059
were so many enthusiastic JavaScript

00:01:05,059 --> 00:01:07,850
developers in Hamburg and this group is

10
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:10,100
like so diverse I never imagined we had

11
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:11,690
such a passionate and terrific community

12
00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:13,890
that was pretty eye-opening

this conference last year and I came

16
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,689
this year again even it's a very good

17
00:01:48,689 --> 00:01:50,549
conference that people are very friendly

18
00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:53,369
it's also very interesting thanks to

19
00:01:53,369 --> 00:01:55,560
everyone who participated in this

20
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,720
conference organizers making food

00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:26,209
I like this kind of style that everyone

24
00:02:26,209 --> 00:02:27,410
seems to like I have a voice

26
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:32,980

00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:33,850
former days

28
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:36,220
I love the new venue actually I want to

29
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:37,630
keep it I don't want to go back to the

30
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:39,130
old one I think it's something very

31
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:43,310
special in Hamburg

00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:57,360
I am actually not a JavaScript developer

34
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,780
but I go to a lot of JavaScript maybe

35
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:03,659
