1
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:20,180
Thank you for listening to my talk.

2
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:23,660
It is my first time on the JS conf stage.

3
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:26,320
I have a handful of friends who had.

4
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:32,759
This is the title of my talk.

5
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:35,750
Last year, some of you heard of Edward Snowden.

6
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:39,050
And the revelations about Nsa.

7
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:47,059
He didn't talk about malicious hackers.

8
00:00:47,059 --> 00:00:51,690
Some people might not worry about government
surveillance.

9
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:57,549
Being secure is important.

10
00:00:57,549 --> 00:01:00,200
We saw a rise in crypto currencies.

11
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:02,890
About a year ago.

12
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:05,630
The number of Bitcoin wallets were half a
million.

13
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:08,340
Now they are over 2.

14
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:11,170
There are other crypto currencies.

15
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:16,890
They are normal cryptography and security.

16
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:22,850
Snowden said, the bottom line is that the
crypto does work.

17
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:30,299
They can't break the math out there.

18
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:38,350
Strong crypto, we really need it.

19
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:42,020
Secure file transfer.

20
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:43,020
It is important.

21
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:47,030
That is your money if you are into that.

22
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:50,049
I am not a cryptographer as all.

23
00:01:50,049 --> 00:01:51,139
I'm a UI/UX designer.

24
00:01:51,139 --> 00:01:57,080
I have been working on Mailpile for the last
year.

25
00:01:57,080 --> 00:02:01,469
A secure way to read, write and organize piles
of email.

26
00:02:01,469 --> 00:02:09,920
When we started working about it, when the
Snowden stuff started leaking.

27
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:11,970
We need to focus on it a lot.

28
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:16,860
We consulted with the security community.

29
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:23,400
We are not going to do javascript cryptography.

30
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,650
Maybe you hope to see that.

31
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:26,879
The talks yesterdat were about that.

32
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:28,940
I will go into it.

33
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:32,880
And why we chose not to do it.

34
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:40,129
One of the first aspects of cryptography and
public private key cryptography is secure

35
00:02:40,129 --> 00:02:43,220
key generation.

36
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:50,180
In order to sign and verify and send data.

37
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:57,629
And here is an example that somebody made
recently about Javascript cryptography.

38
00:02:57,629 --> 00:03:05,040
Using curves instead of prime numbers, we
can generate faster keys zozer He will generate

39
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:09,360
it here while the keybase Pgp.

40
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:13,801
He was proud of how fast it is.

41
00:03:13,801 --> 00:03:16,860
It is awesome.

42
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:22,220
Right about here he typed a command.

43
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:26,099
Window.Crypto.

44
00:03:26,099 --> 00:03:31,720
Tim's talk focused on it.

45
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,219
It is awesome, exciting Api.

46
00:03:33,219 --> 00:03:35,010
We are going to hopefully integrate.

47
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:38,510
Once it stabalizes a bit more.

48
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:40,659
When we looked into it a year ago.

49
00:03:40,659 --> 00:03:43,730
This was 2 days ago.

50
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:46,129
Some of the Api's have stabilized.

51
00:03:46,129 --> 00:03:52,400
But Window.Crypto is not supported in a lot
of browsers.

52
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,379
Okay, why not choose an Html5 app?

53
00:03:56,379 --> 00:04:02,930
Or chrome or Firefox or Opera or IE app.

54
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:06,409
You get the point.

55
00:04:06,409 --> 00:04:11,940
And in that case you are getting a browser
that has the api's available and you run the

56
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:13,550
cryptography in Javascript.

57
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:18,430
Email, you are dealing with a large volumes.

58
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:24,920
Browser specific shims.

59
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,930
And that can be a nightbeir.

60
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:32,470
Not really Smtp or Imap support from Browser
app.

61
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:35,090
Firefox OS is making progress.

62
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:37,060
You can do it in Firefox Osh.

63
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:41,000
The rest is not doable.

64
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,389
Another big aspect is the code integrity.

65
00:04:43,389 --> 00:04:45,700
As js files get downloaded from the server.

66
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:49,500
They can switch at any point.

67
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,770
Hijacked.

68
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:58,220
Your keys and communications can be compromised.

69
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:03,190
We felt that Js is getting there but it is
not there yet for our needs.

70
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:07,949
However, there are some really solid Js crypto
apps out there.

71
00:05:07,949 --> 00:05:11,160
Cryptocat and minilock by Na jdim.

72
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:17,620
You should follow along with him and try out
his apps.

73
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:21,600
They are really great.

74
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:26,910
He is making a ton of progress in that direction.

75
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:29,600
Back to our approach of what we built.

76
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,319
Browser based apps.

77
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:36,199
It runs in a browser.

78
00:05:36,199 --> 00:05:40,419
We also have this idea of local browser based
apps.

79
00:05:40,419 --> 00:05:43,420
Have patience here.

80
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:47,120
Imagine running an app on a local host.

81
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:51,000
The rest of the world is like what I don't
understand it.

82
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,120
It is not a viable solution.

83
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:59,200
I use browser to go to the internet.

84
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:02,819
What we are going for is this hybrid app.

85
00:06:02,819 --> 00:06:06,569
A python backend and Html5 frontend.

86
00:06:06,569 --> 00:06:13,350
That people interact with zozer Native installers
from Mac Os and Windows.

87
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:17,330
Zoz and Native integration like toolbar and
tray.

88
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:22,350
You can install it easily.

89
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:23,451
It spins up a browser instance.

90
00:06:23,451 --> 00:06:26,310
When you are ready to access it.

91
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:28,629
You might be shaking your heads.

92
00:06:28,629 --> 00:06:29,639
Okay.

93
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:32,300
Wait, this guy, what are you talking about?

94
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:37,750
There is a lot of good reasons we want to
experiment with this.

95
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:41,139
One thing is the larger talent pool.

96
00:06:41,139 --> 00:06:44,970
In web versus native revelopers is 68%.

97
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:50,699
I'm getting the statistics from Github.

98
00:06:50,699 --> 00:06:52,849
And I realise it is not exact numbers.

99
00:06:52,849 --> 00:06:54,870
Some web apps are in Java.

100
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:58,340
And some are in Python.

101
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:02,569
The difference is why I'm saying it is a webapp.

102
00:07:02,569 --> 00:07:06,629
Not using a native.

103
00:07:06,629 --> 00:07:10,699
Like QT or something else.

104
00:07:10,699 --> 00:07:15,850
There is a lot of deployment options.

105
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:20,620
deploy to your local computer or the server.

106
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:22,750
And access it over the network.

107
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:27,509
As long is it is securely zozer You get a
ton of benefits.

108
00:07:27,509 --> 00:07:33,569
Your interface can respond and adapt to whatever
device.

109
00:07:33,569 --> 00:07:35,560
As developers of that.

110
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:38,150
One real interface logic.

111
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:42,169
We don't have to have multiple ones in different
languages.

112
00:07:42,169 --> 00:07:46,800
Then the question is, where is the crypto
going to happen?

113
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,379
Why makes it secure?

114
00:07:50,379 --> 00:07:54,050
Imagine we have the Html frontend.

115
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:57,669
Data interacts with the application.

116
00:07:57,669 --> 00:08:01,030
That gets send to a python backend.

117
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:04,110
Or from templates.

118
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:08,319
And it talks to a Binary and passes it back.

119
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:15,439
The frontend code never really interacts with
any of the mission critical crypto things

120
00:08:15,439 --> 00:08:17,629
like private keys.

121
00:08:17,629 --> 00:08:19,540
Which is a huge security gain.

122
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:23,720
The Gnupg has been a long time.

123
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:30,040
And a ton of eyes on it.

124
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:36,280
It is not some sort of bleeding edge thing
that is likely to expose somebody's safety.

125
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:41,260
However, it does happen, even with these projects.

126
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:44,580
The security committee feels, use things like
that.

127
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:48,790
And you are better off.

128
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:51,860
Front-end developers.

129
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:53,200
We never have to touch crypto code.

130
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,570
You don't need to learn about it.

131
00:08:56,570 --> 00:08:58,980
And compromise your own privacy.

132
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:02,130
You didn't understand the right place to pass.

133
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:05,880
The right variable, whatever.

134
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:09,660
That leaks your data of the key.

135
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:16,140
Another benefit of building apps with this
style is that your backend developers can

136
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:23,490
access and interact with many other parts
of the system.

137
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:29,610
To do more secure anonimous requests zozer
You couldn't do that in browser app.

138
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:35,839
And Gpg tools is another desktop Pgp app.

139
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:41,170
If you need power user features, the Api's
will still hook and interact.

140
00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:45,940
You'll be able to share the same keys.

141
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:47,810
As well as Gpg tools.

142
00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:50,480
There is this rising trend.

143
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:54,420
That there are these local browser based apps.

144
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:57,760
We are not the only ones doing this thing.

145
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:02,240
Tagspaces is cool.

146
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,240
How to describe it.

147
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:06,160
To organize your files on your computer.

148
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:10,290
It gives much more interesting power user
way of sharing, archiving them.

149
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:13,190
Novocut is a collaborative film.

150
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:14,190
And Metapolator.

151
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:15,250
I believe python.

152
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:16,250
Novacut is phython.

153
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:17,250
And Tagspaces is in...

154
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:18,250
They are interested in that.

155
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:42,180
2 of the 3 are written with backends.

156
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:45,430
Javascript is perfect.

157
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:48,480
Create amazingly usable frech interfaces.

158
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,260
That's what Pgp needs.

159
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:54,029
When I got involved with it.

160
00:10:54,029 --> 00:10:58,050
You are a de signer.

161
00:10:58,050 --> 00:11:01,480
Pgp is this drag into...

162
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:04,930
Depend who you talk to.

163
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:05,930
This is the problem.

164
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:09,190
No, the fingerprint.

165
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:10,930
It goes on and on on.

166
00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:15,570
I think, I have a theory why it is such a
nightmare.

167
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:18,089
I'll get to that in a few more slides.

168
00:11:18,089 --> 00:11:23,870
A year ago I created by first Pgp key.

169
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:27,019
How many have you created a Pgp key key?

170
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:30,480
How many use them?

171
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,480
Okay.

172
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:37,930
How many you feel confident you understand
Pgp.

173
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:40,839
Maybe 5 people that did the last round.

174
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:42,570
That's good.

175
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:45,120
The first key I created I can't use anymore.

176
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,560
I delited the private one.

177
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:56,890
One of my friends is a 1024.

178
00:11:56,890 --> 00:12:00,620
And Wait, like, that must be bad.

179
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:03,740
Sure enough, one of my friends said, it is
bad.

180
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:07,459
The users should not be thinking about this.

181
00:12:07,459 --> 00:12:13,880
It is the culture of the people who have been
building software for all these years.

182
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:16,310
They don't think about it.

183
00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:18,250
And then there is actions.

184
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:20,310
Send me your public key.

185
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:21,310
You have this big block of text.

186
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:24,399
You are supposed to email it.

187
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:27,520
There is not a clear way of doing it.

188
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:32,579
It gets sent wrong.

189
00:12:32,579 --> 00:12:36,020
Or you encrypt it.

190
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:38,790
It leaves you feeling frustrated.

191
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:41,130
Interfaces look like this.

192
00:12:41,130 --> 00:12:44,690
This is the view.

193
00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:47,089
They are awesome guys and collaborating with
them.

194
00:12:47,089 --> 00:12:48,910
To share icons.

195
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:55,630
And It is a unified user experience.

196
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:58,940
Here is an example of a keychain.

197
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:02,890
It is this really boring tabular list.

198
00:13:02,890 --> 00:13:06,580
Okay, I think I understand.

199
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:11,000
And here is what we are going for.

200
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,519
A social networking sort of experience of
people.

201
00:13:14,519 --> 00:13:16,160
It is about people.

202
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:21,110
We don't have, the keychain has dipsappeared.

203
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:23,760
Being a frontend developer.

204
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:31,220
What does it mean to a user?

205
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:37,240
As a frontend person or persons in this room,
it is the sort of thing we can bring to the

206
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:41,490
old school applications in local context.

207
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:44,269
There is more than crypto.

208
00:13:44,269 --> 00:13:51,149
Fixing older experiences from web development
standpoint can be interesting.

209
00:13:51,149 --> 00:13:54,209
A rest Api.

210
00:13:54,209 --> 00:13:59,610
Standard issue you are used to interacting
with.

211
00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:02,480
That enables us to do a lot of interesting
things.

212
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:07,510
Build plugins.

213
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:08,769
These columns of emails.

214
00:14:08,769 --> 00:14:12,810
It is interesting and new and fresh.

215
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:19,300
Here is another example.

216
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:21,130
Using the 3D library.

217
00:14:21,130 --> 00:14:23,170
That's my sociograph.

218
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:31,199
If I do Js I get a different sociograph.

219
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:35,260
The next level is to build and interact with
it.

220
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:37,410
It is interesting.

221
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:41,139
Instead of a traditional email list.

222
00:14:41,139 --> 00:14:42,620
We have a commandline interface.

223
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:48,959
We are going to expose through pipes.

224
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:55,720
How to interact with email data zozer One
of the big things we care about is decentralizing

225
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:56,860
the web.

226
00:14:56,860 --> 00:15:05,769
Instead of these large entities where everything
is a webserver by a big company.

227
00:15:05,769 --> 00:15:10,850
Let's reexpose the local host and computer
and have it accessible.

228
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:12,220
Through Pagekite.

229
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:16,019
Or Tor.

230
00:15:16,019 --> 00:15:20,269
I can expose my laptop and anybody could access
it.

231
00:15:20,269 --> 00:15:25,170
When you do that, local becomes a server.

232
00:15:25,170 --> 00:15:27,709
Your email could live on your private computer.

233
00:15:27,709 --> 00:15:29,690
You could punch through the net.

234
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:31,870
And access it from the nobile devices.

235
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:36,010
And you don't have to trust third parties.

236
00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:37,010
That's what it was in the 90s.

237
00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:43,019
It went in the other direction.

238
00:15:43,019 --> 00:15:45,161
The tools are out there and we can work towards
it.

239
00:15:45,161 --> 00:15:49,920
There is a demo online.

240
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,380
If you find this project interesting.

241
00:15:51,380 --> 00:16:01,390
And you want to explore, what a new approach
to email looks like.

242
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:06,510
We have it in different languages.

243
00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:08,449
We released the beta.

244
00:16:08,449 --> 00:16:12,899
You are the first who know about it.

245
00:16:12,899 --> 00:16:19,790
We like you have it download it.

246
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:24,290
Suggest dream features.

247
00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:28,759
Anything you want to improve.

248
00:16:28,759 --> 00:16:31,110
I'm Brennan Novak.

249
00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:33,280
My key is in that QR code.

250
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:34,980
if you are into that.

251
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:35,980
Thank you very much.
