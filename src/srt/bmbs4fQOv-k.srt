1
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,940
Good morning everyone, my name is Ali Tabibzadeh from Iran.

2
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:13,650
I'm currently living in Tehran.

3
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:17,740
It is an honor to be among you here virtually.

4
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:25,199
Today I want to share with you a very enlightening
journey I had in learning what community and

5
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:28,300
inclusiveness are all about.

6
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:34,020
This journey is by attending this very same
conference back in 2014.

7
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:39,570
The time that these concepts didn't really
mean anything in my country.

8
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:46,690
And as you can see, I've kept this T shirt
which I love very much.

9
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:54,260
To give a very brief introduction about myself,
I started my career in tech from design.

10
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:57,080
Then doing frontend development for years.

11
00:00:57,080 --> 00:01:02,660
But now I have shifted towards the business
side of technology.

12
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:10,910
I've had the privilege to experience a lot
by curating three tech related ventures with

13
00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:13,250
my friends over the past decade.

14
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:19,440
Currently alongside my capable partners and
colleagues, I run a little sort of focused

15
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:25,670
on digital transformation products in travel
and single finance.

16
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:32,470
The goals I want to achieve from this talk
is to give a new point of view on community

17
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:38,210
values from a perspective that has not experienced
it before.

18
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:44,820
What valuable impacts and different profits
the communities generate within themselves

19
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:48,260
and on their outer ecosystem.

20
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:56,260
And most important of all, the openness of
technology related communities that makes

21
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:58,570
them for other sectors.

22
00:01:58,570 --> 00:02:08,869
It makes us appreciate the efforts more and
even do as little as we can for the communities

23
00:02:08,869 --> 00:02:10,319
we are in.

24
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:16,900
And one interesting point, if it wasn't for
community, this presentation wouldn't be possible

25
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:23,620
as my good friends provided me with a camera,
a microphone, and, of course, above all, the

26
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:24,620
support.

27
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:28,240
I will approach this from two sides of the
argument.

28
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:38,060
First, how I learned about community building
for the first time in Berlin four years ago.

29
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:45,569
Important that JSConf EU had taught me and
how I witnessed and helped in partially developing

30
00:02:45,569 --> 00:02:47,410
communities in my county.

31
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:55,510
Second, with two real life examples I want
to proudly say that the synergism and volunteer

32
00:02:55,510 --> 00:03:02,270
work in tech related communities should inspire
other sectors to take community building more

33
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:06,860
seriously in order to evolve to a more vibrant
ecosystem.

34
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:10,860
So, where did this all start?

35
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:15,590
I used to watch JSConf videos for education
purposes on YouTube.

36
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:21,210
And once I said so myself, I wish we had something
similar in our country.

37
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:27,520
I visited their website and read online that
they are open to let us do so.

38
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:32,890
Then, maybe we should run a JSConf in Iran.

39
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:40,790
Unfortunately, back then, and still now, we
do not have safe and easy access to international

40
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:41,980
payment methods.

41
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:48,239
And then telling the curator team about it,
they surprised me by inviting me to the event.

42
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:51,970
They're so loving,aren't they?

43
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:56,349
Attending JSConf EU 2014 is where this journey
began.

44
00:03:56,349 --> 00:04:03,280
Where I learned how volunteer work benefits
everyone in all important aspects of life

45
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,640
and business.

46
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:14,350
Because, believe me, if you are not familiar
with it, this may look or sound a bit weird.

47
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:18,359
Some words were really bold in the JSConf
sphere.

48
00:04:18,359 --> 00:04:20,689
Which I didn't understand.

49
00:04:20,689 --> 00:04:21,979
First was inclusiveness.

50
00:04:21,979 --> 00:04:25,129
And I was like, what does it mean?

51
00:04:25,129 --> 00:04:28,159
What is inclusiveness?

52
00:04:28,159 --> 00:04:32,180
I had only heard about exclusiveness in my
country.

53
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:39,319
It was as if everyone was trying so hard to
get an exclusive privilege to get ahead.

54
00:04:39,319 --> 00:04:45,960
Even most prominent companies and products
advertisements showed big, exclusive words

55
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,370
attached to them.

56
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:50,719
So, you can see my perspective.

57
00:04:50,719 --> 00:04:56,839
Other words that confused me were labor of
love and not for profit.

58
00:04:56,839 --> 00:05:01,979
I was wondering why someone would run this
huge event not for getting direct profit.

59
00:05:01,979 --> 00:05:06,800
Because, honestly, it was the other way around
in my country.

60
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:13,840
The curators taught me a great deal about
their experience curating and running this

61
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,169
conference.

62
00:05:15,169 --> 00:05:21,289
Explaining the experience and principles of
JSConf community and how they would use the

63
00:05:21,289 --> 00:05:27,169
sponsors' support to upgrade the conference
quality and in all these matters.

64
00:05:27,169 --> 00:05:31,590
Meanwhile, I was experiencing the conference
myself.

65
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:38,039
Meeting wonderful people, exchangeideas,
talking about collaboration opportunities

66
00:05:38,039 --> 00:05:44,990
and receiving valuable insights and offers
from world leading sponsors and many more

67
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:46,690
fulfilling moments.

68
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:50,169
It was starting to make sense.

69
00:05:50,169 --> 00:05:52,689
The pieces of the puzzle were coming together.

70
00:05:52,689 --> 00:05:55,660
And the last piece was this sentence.

71
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:58,699
It is not just a conference, but a community.

72
00:05:58,699 --> 00:06:03,050
You should first build the community, then
the conference would mean something.

73
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:09,830
I still remember very vividly the friendly
and productive talk I had with Christine that

74
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:18,020
when she was telling me about her experience
in creating a running the up front meetup

75
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:22,879
community with her co organizers and the CSSConf.

76
00:06:22,879 --> 00:06:26,900
As you may have noticed, I also missed this
year.

77
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:32,680
So, I came back very pumped with a crystal
clear vision.

78
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:37,619
I gathered a couple of people who I thought
would be interested and they were in.

79
00:06:37,619 --> 00:06:43,809
Back then the Iranian system was at its infancy,
the startups, just starting to build one with

80
00:06:43,809 --> 00:06:45,869
baby steps.

81
00:06:45,869 --> 00:06:52,080
First the Iranian sort of accelerator was
founded six months after my return.

82
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:58,930
So, back then we had to approach more to additional
entities and venues.

83
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:05,340
Unfortunately, we didn't find much luck and
we got some empty promises that were never

84
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:06,340
fulfilled.

85
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:12,030
There was only one tech meetup back then.

86
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:18,669
The Linux user group, which were mostly hosted
in software companies.

87
00:07:18,669 --> 00:07:24,240
I attended a session right after coming back
to Tehran for the first time.

88
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,069
It was quite a lovely community.

89
00:07:27,069 --> 00:07:29,419
They had their own benefits and own challenges.

90
00:07:29,419 --> 00:07:34,139
But more importantly, a bit far from the web
community.

91
00:07:34,139 --> 00:07:41,860
So, there was no room for the specific topic
of JavaScript.

92
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:47,199
We continued attracting support, explaining
the vision and talking about the community

93
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:54,020
which will have the comprehensive conference
with the JSConf.

94
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:59,229
We got some interesting answers in return.

95
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:04,429
They were like not for profit conference?

96
00:08:04,429 --> 00:08:07,509
What are you talking about?

97
00:08:07,509 --> 00:08:15,919
And sometimes they didn't have an answer to
that thought.

98
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:25,679
It was our passion, but [audio breaking up]
the timing is not right.

99
00:08:25,679 --> 00:08:29,229
Maybe we should try later in the future.

100
00:08:29,229 --> 00:08:36,729
During this time, I was working on my second
startup to figure out what to do next.

101
00:08:36,729 --> 00:08:42,750
And this they urged me to get back to business.

102
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:44,720
The time passed.

103
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:49,830
In one and a half years, the Iranian ecosystem
grew significantly.

104
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:56,600
Suddenly you would see a number of businesses,
accelerators and community events were starting

105
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:59,430
to pop up here and there.

106
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:05,190
When I was so caught up building our new business,
I was thrilled to hear that my friends were

107
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:11,910
finally able to do that and curated a community
for Tehran called Tehran JS.

108
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:17,090
This wonderful meetup by these three people
that you see their pictures.

109
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:24,160
Tehran JS meetup has been held averagely every
two weeks since early 2016.

110
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:30,160
It has now almost 1,000 members and new members
joining every day.

111
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:35,860
I was glad to see they had the right principles
and a lot of good work was being done in this

112
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:36,860
community.

113
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:39,860
And you saw a few pictures of them.

114
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:44,090
This is where the second side of the argument
will begin to conclude.

115
00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:50,080
As we were new in tourism and pursuing niche
markets that no one had entered before, we

116
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:55,390
thought that maybe it's best if we created
a community for the travel industry to make

117
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:58,440
a positive impact.

118
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:02,610
We wanted to apply the community building
principles and create an inclusive platform

119
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:04,620
for everyone to benefit from.

120
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:08,610
So, we started tourism up in August 2016.

121
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:14,010
Here you can see a few pictures of our events.

122
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:17,470
This event was held on a monthly basis.

123
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:23,850
And over the six months we had the pleasure
to host more than 300 participants in two

124
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:27,590
chapters in Tehran.

125
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:37,000
Now, I want to do an honest comparison between
these two community building endeavors and

126
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,500
sharing with you what happened to them and
why.

127
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:43,730
Tehran JS was thriving.

128
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:48,160
It was fulfilling every aspect that the community
promises.

129
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:53,320
When I contacted my friends in the organizing
team to talk about joining forces for running

130
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:56,890
JSConf together, they were open to any forms
of collaboration.

131
00:10:56,890 --> 00:10:58,760
So, this is very beautiful.

132
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:01,450
This is where we talk about openness and inclusiveness.

133
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:07,191
In the community side, it was exhilarating
to see how people were submitting talks, to

134
00:11:07,191 --> 00:11:14,060
volunteer in running the event, offering each
other projects and companies were finding

135
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:15,850
talents to hire.

136
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:17,580
Benefits for all.

137
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:22,430
This is, indeed, where it is worth the effort
to curate the community.

138
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:28,190
On the other hand, despite putting tremendous
efforts and resources into this, we couldn't

139
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:30,560
achieve the same thing in tourism app.

140
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:33,120
Where the technology mind set was involved.

141
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:37,060
After a few events, we had to try so hard
to find speakers.

142
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:44,110
When creating task forces for joint community
projects, people would volunteer, but unfortunately,

143
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:45,360
not deliver.

144
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,610
We do not blame them at all.

145
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:50,360
We have to accept these as facts.

146
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:57,340
Because, despite Iran's potential in tourism,
the industry is not yet advanced.

147
00:11:57,340 --> 00:12:01,540
And it is suffering from traditional ways
of doing business.

148
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:07,700
People were so occupied with their daily hustle
and so under the impression of inclusiveness

149
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:13,540
in projects that they were unable to see the
benefits in community.

150
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:17,400
We accepted this failure after six months.

151
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:24,880
And we thought maybe it's best to temporarily
shut it down so the industry can evolve and

152
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,090
then we can come back.

153
00:12:27,090 --> 00:12:33,560
When no one could benefit from this community,
it was no longer good to waste everyone's

154
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:36,840
resources and time on this.

155
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:45,930
As we went through a comparison between success
and failure stories, I think this is the only

156
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:49,190
sentence we can get as the conclusion.

157
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:52,420
Proactive participation by all is key.

158
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:55,870
And technology is built by the very same spirit.

159
00:12:55,870 --> 00:13:02,980
That is why there is less burden in applying
this in technology communities.

160
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:05,430
No single entity can run a community.

161
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:09,120
A community is formed by effort of the many.

162
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:13,750
Last year Whitney Williams said in her speech
that leadership in communities are by the

163
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:15,990
many, to the by the few.

164
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:18,510
So true, isn't it?

165
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:24,910
I am proud to say that the JavaScript community
is thriving in Iran by many people's contribution.

166
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:29,090
And we are starting to find forward thinking
sponsors.

167
00:13:29,090 --> 00:13:35,740
We hope to hold the JSConf Iran conference
in the next year with the help of its international

168
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:36,740
family.

169
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:42,190
And we strongly hope we can see you here in
Tehran someday soon.

170
00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:47,450
To wrap this up, we all know that the small
actions create big impacts.

171
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:49,000
This might take time.

172
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,560
So, does every sustainable and long lasting
result.

173
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:58,440
Our small actions and giving back to the society
creates social capital.

174
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:03,700
A meaningful concept that can help us in every
aspect of our lives.

175
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:10,280
I believe I am talking in a place that everyone
knows and appreciates the values of this.

176
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:15,779
But it is worth sharing this side of the story
for more encouragement.

177
00:14:15,779 --> 00:14:21,230
This feedback, I believe, are what drives
us to be active community players.

178
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:28,540
We all have learned a lot and given back to
the open source community.

179
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:34,290
But I think there is more to OSS than open
source software.

180
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:37,910
Let's think of it as the open source spirit.

181
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:41,920
This is why we should be proud of ourselves
that we are community builders.

182
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,779
Not lobbyists.

183
00:14:43,779 --> 00:14:50,930
Thank you, everyone, and I hope to reunite
with you very soon whether in Iran or at any
