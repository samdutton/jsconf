1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,930

Oh

2
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:08,260
good afternoon my name is Alex I'm from

3
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:11,590
Berlin and thank you very much Jared and

4
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:13,690
all the organizers and also Maxine and

5
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:15,370
John from web directions for having me

6
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:18,280
here it's a great privilege to be flown

7
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:19,750
halfway around the world to talk about

8
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:22,660
things you care about and I I'm still a

9
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:24,640
bit baffled but yes it's amazing thanks

10
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,640
very much for having you as Jared said I

11
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:30,369
work on a project called hoodie which I

12
00:00:30,369 --> 00:00:33,519
won't be talking about actually because

13
00:00:33,519 --> 00:00:36,309
I think that as much as I adore hoodie

14
00:00:36,309 --> 00:00:38,020
for how brilliant it is and I think it's

15
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:39,850
really important but I also think that

16
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:43,510
the last talk of a talk the conference

17
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:44,829
it's also kind of special and it should

18
00:00:44,829 --> 00:00:46,930
be about something special and actually

19
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:48,250
have a larger scope and just you know

20
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:52,030
one project so yeah this is a talk about

21
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:54,280
perspectives it's called step office

22
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:58,750
hurtling machine and it yeah part one

23
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:02,199
take a step outside yourself so the web

24
00:01:02,199 --> 00:01:04,629
turned 25 not too long ago and I think

25
00:01:04,629 --> 00:01:05,920
it's a good opportunity to take a look

26
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,359
back at its history and I don't mean a

27
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:09,009
technical history you know with ARPANET

28
00:01:09,009 --> 00:01:11,649
and CERN and everything but the cultural

29
00:01:11,649 --> 00:01:13,509
history where does all the the way we

30
00:01:13,509 --> 00:01:15,909
think come from in this industry and on

31
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:18,279
the web and this story starts like many

32
00:01:18,279 --> 00:01:20,770
stories start in San Francisco in fact

33
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:21,990
it starts on the roof of that building

34
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:24,909
which is the old American Red Cross

35
00:01:24,909 --> 00:01:27,819
building so in the corner of second

36
00:01:27,819 --> 00:01:30,969
mission and the mission district in san

37
00:01:30,969 --> 00:01:33,689
francisco california united states

38
00:01:33,689 --> 00:01:37,569
planet earth and on that roof was a very

39
00:01:37,569 --> 00:01:39,579
surprisingly small antenna and it talked

40
00:01:39,579 --> 00:01:41,020
to a machine that was hovering somewhere

41
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:42,609
round about where we are looking back

42
00:01:42,609 --> 00:01:44,799
down at the earth a NASA satellite

43
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:49,149
called 80s three and 80s three had a

44
00:01:49,149 --> 00:01:52,270
couple of jobs so whether experiments

45
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:54,249
and communications and navigation things

46
00:01:54,249 --> 00:01:55,630
and all sorts of technical stuff but it

47
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:56,739
also had what you could call the

48
00:01:56,739 --> 00:02:00,340
cultural mission which was the first

49
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:02,399
full disc photographs of Earth and

50
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:04,950
that's what it did it took the first

51
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:08,569
full color photograph of planet Earth

52
00:02:08,569 --> 00:02:12,709
and in this was in 1967 and after almost

53
00:02:12,709 --> 00:02:15,560
20 years of sending cameras into space

54
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,629
this was the first time we purposely

55
00:02:17,629 --> 00:02:19,609
looked back upon ourselves with a truly

56
00:02:19,609 --> 00:02:20,959
new perspective and suddenly there was

57
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:23,689
this image this cultural artifact that

58
00:02:23,689 --> 00:02:25,730
encompassed that entirety of our species

59
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:28,730
in our history and back on earth that

60
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:30,170
made one land very happy and oddly

61
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:32,060
enough he lived not far away from that

62
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:33,439
red cross building because everything

63
00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:35,120
happens in San Francisco apparently and

64
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,749
that man was Stewart Brand while on LSD

65
00:02:38,749 --> 00:02:40,430
and 60s he had this idea that a

66
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:43,639
photograph of Earth could really you

67
00:02:43,639 --> 00:02:46,669
know unify human humanity and give a new

68
00:02:46,669 --> 00:02:50,449
kind of perspective to humans basically

69
00:02:50,449 --> 00:02:54,500
and broaden their consciousness so he

70
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,180
campaigned to have this photo taken and

71
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:58,370
we sold these buttons all over the

72
00:02:58,370 --> 00:02:59,900
United States and he wrote to NASA and

73
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:01,489
you've got two politicians in America

74
00:03:01,489 --> 00:03:03,379
and in Soviet Russia he really didn't

75
00:03:03,379 --> 00:03:04,879
care who took the photograph as long as

76
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:07,579
somebody took the photograph and well as

77
00:03:07,579 --> 00:03:09,260
we saw NASA took the photograph and

78
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:11,030
since everything they do is public

79
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:12,919
domain he could use it for basically

80
00:03:12,919 --> 00:03:15,979
anything and yeah he used it for the

81
00:03:15,979 --> 00:03:19,009
first of what I call brands three big

82
00:03:19,009 --> 00:03:20,840
projects and all of these three projects

83
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:23,449
do resonate with what we do and what we

84
00:03:23,449 --> 00:03:30,109
are today so project one 1968 the whole

85
00:03:30,109 --> 00:03:32,989
earth catalog access to tools for 1968

86
00:03:32,989 --> 00:03:36,379
five dollars now this thing was often

87
00:03:36,379 --> 00:03:38,090
called the Sears catalog for the

88
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:40,310
counterculture brand and his wife Lois

89
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:42,349
wanted to list everything you needed to

90
00:03:42,349 --> 00:03:45,349
create a new better society in the in a

91
00:03:45,349 --> 00:03:47,599
commune somewhere in the desert so they

92
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:50,479
collected useful stuff and basically

93
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:52,400
they made a shopping catalogue so in

94
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,989
included books about Indian teepees and

95
00:03:53,989 --> 00:03:56,509
growing mushrooms and books on organic

96
00:03:56,509 --> 00:03:59,209
gardening beekeeping and of course books

97
00:03:59,209 --> 00:04:01,370
by Buckminster Fuller on domes and

98
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:03,979
tensile structures and well so far so

99
00:04:03,979 --> 00:04:05,870
predictable 460 San Francisco I think

100
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:08,239
but the catalog got more to offer

101
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:11,239
actually so more books first of all so

102
00:04:11,239 --> 00:04:13,909
psychological reflections the human use

103
00:04:13,909 --> 00:04:16,459
of human beings the ghost in the machine

104
00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:21,310
the year 2000 the futurist modern utopia

105
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:24,490
jun of course it had you the Green

106
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:26,470
Revolution and very interestingly groups

107
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:30,850
under stress and even more books human

108
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:34,810
bio computer information cybernetics but

109
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:36,700
maybe most telling of war in this

110
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:38,650
catalogue of things you would need for a

111
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:40,810
commune in the desert is that

112
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:42,570
programmable calculator in the top right

113
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:44,620
that's a four thousand nine hundred

114
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:48,160
dollar programmable calculator and in

115
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,490
today's money that's 35,000 australian

116
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:57,360
dollars that's enough to buy two

117
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,070
volkswagen camper vans back in 60s

118
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:01,300
california and still have a couple of

119
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:03,880
hundred dollars left over so what kind

120
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:06,490
of hippies was this more exactly eighty

121
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:08,229
percent of the products referenced in

122
00:05:08,229 --> 00:05:10,210
the catalogue workbooks so you had some

123
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:11,979
things like boobs and shovels but mainly

124
00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:15,520
you had books the catalog wanted to the

125
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,960
tools the catalog wanted to provide

126
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,970
access to weren't necessarily physical

127
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:21,430
tools they were mostly ideas and big

128
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:24,460
ideas at that and when I say referenced

129
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:26,020
it's interesting because the catalog

130
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:28,720
didn't actually sell anything it was

131
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,320
only an index for distributed objects

132
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,570
and documents and if that sounds

133
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:38,229
familiar well should be anyway the

134
00:05:38,229 --> 00:05:39,820
catalog became very influential had

135
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:41,470
profound I opening effect and quite a

136
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:43,150
lot of people and it's all rather well

137
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:45,490
too but practically none of them managed

138
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:47,130
to sustain a successful commune

139
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:49,240
small-scale politics and groups on

140
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:53,889
easily solved by a mail-order but lots

141
00:05:53,889 --> 00:05:55,090
of people didn't see the whole of

142
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:56,740
catalog as a guide to escape modern

143
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:58,180
society they saw it as a technical

144
00:05:58,180 --> 00:05:59,740
futurist manifesto of a social

145
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:01,840
reinvention for new interdisciplinary

146
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,840
thinking at a large scale you'll notice

147
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,910
in the index of the catalog the first

148
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:10,560
thing is understanding whole system's

149
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,000
kind of shows you which direction this

150
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,760
was all meant to go the catalog was

151
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,500
absolutely eye-opening it was a how

152
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:18,789
things work book for basically

153
00:06:18,789 --> 00:06:21,460
everything was DIY as the new world

154
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:23,229
order it was a cliff's notes to becoming

155
00:06:23,229 --> 00:06:26,050
a new modern renaissance man massive

156
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:27,700
environment of the individual through

157
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:30,190
information and technology its first

158
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:32,530
line was we are as gods and we might as

159
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:33,770
well get used to it

160
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:36,229
and that's a powerful statement but it

161
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:38,000
still resonates well in the tech world

162
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,139
even today when I was young there was an

163
00:06:42,139 --> 00:06:43,460
amazing publication called the whole

164
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:45,229
earth catalog which was one of the

165
00:06:45,229 --> 00:06:47,360
Bible's of my generation I was

166
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,949
idealistic and overflowing with meat

167
00:06:48,949 --> 00:06:51,560
tools and great notions that was steve

168
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:55,520
jobs in 2005 the catalogs legacy is

169
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,440
marrying two seemingly completely

170
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,539
opposed the ideas environmental

171
00:06:59,539 --> 00:07:01,520
conservation and technological progress

172
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,530
and in the 60s you could you could be in

173
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:04,879
one slider you could be only on the

174
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:06,470
other side you could be for

175
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:08,599
technological progress industrialization

176
00:07:08,599 --> 00:07:11,990
capitalism and the man basically or you

177
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:13,389
could be for sustainability

178
00:07:13,389 --> 00:07:16,280
environmentalism and you could you'd

179
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,810
basically be striving to go back into

180
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:19,819
the wilderness and now the catalog came

181
00:07:19,819 --> 00:07:22,909
along and said no wait you can have

182
00:07:22,909 --> 00:07:25,219
unbridled technological progress without

183
00:07:25,219 --> 00:07:27,500
about conscience it's possible now

184
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:30,069
because technology will solve everything

185
00:07:30,069 --> 00:07:32,060
the problem was becoming its own

186
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:35,210
solution and remember this is sixty San

187
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:37,250
Francisco this is a time where computers

188
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:38,810
were seen as a tool of government

189
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:40,819
oppression and where people went out on

190
00:07:40,819 --> 00:07:42,340
the streets to protest the

191
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:43,940
computerization of University

192
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:45,919
bureaucracy you can see at the bottom of

193
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:48,020
the punch card says do not fold spindle

194
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:50,750
or mutilate and that sentence became

195
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:53,569
iconic symbol of tech anxiety in the 60s

196
00:07:53,569 --> 00:07:55,699
and of course they made buttons about it

197
00:07:55,699 --> 00:07:56,940
again

198
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:59,370
and now the whole earth catalog was

199
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:01,140
managing to reconcile all this and it

200
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:02,280
opened up technology for the

201
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,630
counterculture and it opened up the

202
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:06,750
counterculture for technology now

203
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:10,080
interestingly xerox palo alto research

204
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:13,620
center which has everything to do with

205
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:16,500
what we do do well situated not far away

206
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,210
from where brand lived actually and made

207
00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:19,470
the catalog and for the first couple of

208
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:22,020
years parks library was exclusively

209
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:24,570
stocked with books reference in the

210
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:26,850
catalog Alan Kay worked there and

211
00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:28,320
invented the graphical user interface

212
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:30,210
which Steve Jobs saw there for the first

213
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:33,120
time and the rest well it's basically

214
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:37,620
all descended from there so on to brands

215
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:41,370
second project 1985 the well by the

216
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:43,289
early eighties the catalog was long dead

217
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:44,910
and all the communes may have inspired

218
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:46,950
as well and fueled by enormous defense

219
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:48,480
and infrastructure spending in the past

220
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,670
half century California had long since

221
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:53,340
become the focal point of the tech

222
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:55,350
industry in the world really hippies

223
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:56,790
were being replaced by engineers and

224
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:57,990
hackers it was only a matter of time

225
00:08:57,990 --> 00:09:00,660
till brands ideas and their ideas

226
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:05,280
collided so a program a friend of his

227
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:07,260
and I excuse me for that being so tiny

228
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:10,400
but they've had the same logo.gif since

229
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:14,700
1985 it's really that big I can't do

230
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:16,110
anything about it anyway a friend of

231
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:17,720
brands a man fittingly named brilliant

232
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:20,370
suggested let's just try again let's

233
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:22,080
have an online version of the catalog on

234
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,840
brand said wait let's have an online

235
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:27,660
forum instead but on the same topics and

236
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:31,440
this launched as a BBS in 1985 and it

237
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,730
really took off and it brought the

238
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:34,530
remains of the 60s counterculture people

239
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:36,780
who actually lived in communes brought

240
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:38,460
it in there and brought it together with

241
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:40,650
the new hackers and first we got the

242
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:43,020
well the whole earth electronic link

243
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:45,330
which is a terrible acronym but a very

244
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:50,330
good name so it was new about the well

245
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:52,740
first of all it was fast was much faster

246
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:53,940
than publishing anything on paper

247
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:56,839
obviously but at the time that was new

248
00:09:56,839 --> 00:09:59,280
secondly and this should sound extremely

249
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:01,830
familiar it connected Silicon Valley

250
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:03,780
people in a social network of tech

251
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:05,970
professionals so what this meant people

252
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:07,920
could now switch jobs and products

253
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,600
quickly and easily

254
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,069
is now everyone knew what everyone else

255
00:10:11,069 --> 00:10:14,130
was doing and in a way that is the root

256
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:15,600
of the startup culture somebody

257
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,949
calculated background that the average

258
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:19,680
turnaround time in jobs was a hundred

259
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:23,220
percent of two years so everyone changed

260
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:24,839
their job every two years on average

261
00:10:24,839 --> 00:10:28,589
some even faster third thing was it was

262
00:10:28,589 --> 00:10:31,620
a gift economy was also new people just

263
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:33,180
did stuff for each other professionally

264
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:35,310
and privately and it was kind of an

265
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:37,560
antithesis to this corporate culture it

266
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:38,850
wasn't it was a village it was like a

267
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:40,620
commune people were just you know nice

268
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:44,190
help each other out private life and

269
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:46,139
work started merging in a new way or you

270
00:10:46,139 --> 00:10:48,000
had now had an online persona which

271
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,850
incorporated both your your private life

272
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:54,089
and your work life and you suddenly had

273
00:10:54,089 --> 00:10:55,620
a new social circle that encompassed

274
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:57,990
both things where before both would have

275
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:00,230
been relatively cleanly separated and

276
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:05,069
finally it was a new way of living was

277
00:11:05,069 --> 00:11:07,170
Network constant communal non

278
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:10,829
hierarchical and merit-based and the

279
00:11:10,829 --> 00:11:13,319
well is actually still around today its

280
00:11:13,319 --> 00:11:14,970
influence on our world really can't be

281
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:19,620
understated brands third project the

282
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:22,230
long now foundation so now it's 1996 and

283
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:24,480
brand is once again seeing that you know

284
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,649
some of the things he helped kicked off

285
00:11:25,649 --> 00:11:27,060
a kind of having adverse effects on the

286
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:30,839
world and I started thinking about that

287
00:11:30,839 --> 00:11:33,060
he says civilization is revving itself

288
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:34,620
an empathic logically short attention

289
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:37,500
span strain might be coming from the

290
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,149
acceleration of Technology the short

291
00:11:39,149 --> 00:11:40,889
horizon perspective of market driven

292
00:11:40,889 --> 00:11:42,899
economics the next election perspective

293
00:11:42,899 --> 00:11:45,060
of democracies all the distractions of

294
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:47,370
personal multitasking all around the

295
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:49,769
increase so brand along with a couple of

296
00:11:49,769 --> 00:11:51,779
others created this long now foundation

297
00:11:51,779 --> 00:11:53,579
to increase awareness for the problem

298
00:11:53,579 --> 00:11:56,100
and to foster a mindset of slower but

299
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:58,800
better and his compatriot Danny Hillis

300
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:02,160
wrote when I was a child people used to

301
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,509
talk about what happened by the year

302
00:12:03,509 --> 00:12:06,120
2000 for the next 30 years they kept

303
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,319
talking about was going to happen by the

304
00:12:07,319 --> 00:12:08,459
year two thousand and now nobody

305
00:12:08,459 --> 00:12:11,130
mentions the future at all the future

306
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:13,529
has been shrinking by one year per year

307
00:12:13,529 --> 00:12:15,990
for my entire life I think it's time for

308
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:18,420
us to start a long-term project that

309
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:20,160
gets people thinking past the mental

310
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:23,100
barrier of an ever shortening future

311
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:26,550
so let's see what we can do end of part

312
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:38,850
1 I need a drink part 2 no future given

313
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:39,870
everything I've just said about the

314
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:41,270
catalogue of the well and along now

315
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:43,230
let's talk about us on our relationship

316
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:47,760
to time our industry's technology is

317
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,980
amazingly in flux it changes all the

318
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:51,540
time stuff becomes obsolete and

319
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:53,280
deprecated there's new libraries

320
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,620
frameworks languages workflows best

321
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:57,390
practices preprocessors testing and

322
00:12:57,390 --> 00:12:58,920
deployment infrastructures all the time

323
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:02,460
stuff changes constantly there's new

324
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:04,260
stuff every day as so many newsletters

325
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:05,970
and blogs and people to follow summit

326
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:07,760
should keep up with and so much to learn

327
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,630
it's more than anyone can remember

328
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:12,930
really this is chris coiours short list

329
00:13:12,930 --> 00:13:14,700
of resources you should be following as

330
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:17,370
a web developer presumably a lot of work

331
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:20,510
went into making it this short and

332
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:22,800
anyway we're always on a bleeding edge

333
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,020
really it's what defines us and it's

334
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:27,480
what people pay us for honestly but we

335
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,710
can't stop you can't just get off and

336
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:30,120
say oh well I've learned enough for just

337
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:32,640
you know do my thing from now on and

338
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:35,340
stagnate on a high level can't really do

339
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:37,110
that it leaves little time for anything

340
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:38,730
else especially reflection about what

341
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:40,530
you're doing and we're proud of it I

342
00:13:40,530 --> 00:13:42,240
mean rightfully also because we're proud

343
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,950
of our mental flexibility thinking as we

344
00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:45,420
speak and in a way with the Masters of

345
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:47,700
making it up as we go along it's kind of

346
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:50,730
a programming is in a sense but we're so

347
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:53,340
so stuck in this ever-present now and

348
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:55,580
our industries culture isn't any better

349
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:58,260
startups this huge focus on speed and

350
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:00,750
flexibility on being agile and lean you

351
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:02,100
can pivot your product you can pivot

352
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:03,720
pivot your company I mean think about

353
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:06,030
that you can pivot your entire product

354
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:08,760
if it's not working out it's crazy you

355
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,290
can fail early you can fail off and it

356
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:12,210
doesn't really matter it ship it

357
00:14:12,210 --> 00:14:15,030
our prototypes are rapid so we can adapt

358
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:16,920
and change quickly and in the end

359
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,780
there's acquisitions and sun setting and

360
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:20,130
everything just vanishes as if nothing

361
00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:22,350
happened amalgam when we make mistakes

362
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:24,060
we have version control we can roll

363
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:27,660
things back it's all totally in flux all

364
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:29,790
the time it seems in fact like there's

365
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:31,860
little or no value in actually planning

366
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:33,480
ahead because everything might change at

367
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:34,860
a moment's notice anywhere and we can

368
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:35,720
change anything

369
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:39,050
notice how all that really matters is

370
00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:42,800
this ever-present now and our industry's

371
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,439
content is even worse so Jeremy Keith

372
00:14:45,439 --> 00:14:47,930
last year at brighton's full frontal

373
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:50,149
conference said that fool that an

374
00:14:50,149 --> 00:14:51,740
average web site is online for a hundred

375
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:56,029
days three months given that is it

376
00:14:56,029 --> 00:14:57,470
surprising that we're so focused on the

377
00:14:57,470 --> 00:14:59,839
present everything is ephemeral anyway

378
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:01,759
and we embrace the fleeting nature of

379
00:15:01,759 --> 00:15:03,310
this medium without a conviction because

380
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:05,920
everything changes all the time forever

381
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:10,370
and we're forever accelerating and

382
00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:11,569
fragmenting as well so in the beginning

383
00:15:11,569 --> 00:15:15,139
content was a bit like content was in

384
00:15:15,139 --> 00:15:17,360
the offline world you had websites blog

385
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,920
post and then you have micro blogging

386
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:21,319
then your Twitter the naive snapchat and

387
00:15:21,319 --> 00:15:22,610
by now no doubt you have something

388
00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:23,899
that's even quicker and shorter I'm not

389
00:15:23,899 --> 00:15:27,279
aware of because I'm old I don't know

390
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:30,529
but this means something we become what

391
00:15:30,529 --> 00:15:32,449
we behold and we shape our tools and

392
00:15:32,449 --> 00:15:34,579
then our tools shape us what have we

393
00:15:34,579 --> 00:15:37,040
shape when have you created constant

394
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,860
flow an endless stream of ephemeral

395
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:41,389
content accompanied by the constant

396
00:15:41,389 --> 00:15:44,329
panicky fear of missing something we're

397
00:15:44,329 --> 00:15:46,040
always compelled to stay on the crest of

398
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:49,569
this wave again everything is fast and

399
00:15:49,569 --> 00:15:51,769
we were caught up in microscopic

400
00:15:51,769 --> 00:15:53,569
implementation details and living from

401
00:15:53,569 --> 00:15:55,459
day to day and simply reacting was to

402
00:15:55,459 --> 00:15:57,079
what is happening to us because so much

403
00:15:57,079 --> 00:15:59,689
is happening to us and because the

404
00:15:59,689 --> 00:16:02,149
future is utterly ineffable and we end

405
00:16:02,149 --> 00:16:03,980
up optimizing our creations performance

406
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:05,509
in milliseconds long to see them vanish

407
00:16:05,509 --> 00:16:07,009
into obscurity through a few months

408
00:16:07,009 --> 00:16:10,490
later so in a way we take no

409
00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:12,379
responsibility because we have no

410
00:16:12,379 --> 00:16:13,759
concept of the future everything

411
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:15,709
vanishes again anyway we work in to

412
00:16:15,709 --> 00:16:18,350
avoid we do take responsibility and we

413
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:20,059
do care a lot about the tiny things we

414
00:16:20,059 --> 00:16:22,220
feel we have control over but everything

415
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:24,860
else just carries us along with it and

416
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:26,360
we say that once some things on the web

417
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,889
it'll stay forever but barely anything

418
00:16:27,889 --> 00:16:36,109
really lasts

419
00:16:36,119 --> 00:16:39,129
so our perception of time is skewed I

420
00:16:39,129 --> 00:16:42,279
think but that's only half of our

421
00:16:42,279 --> 00:16:46,449
perspective problem so Jim Menlo Park in

422
00:16:46,449 --> 00:16:48,429
Silicon Valley it's where all the tech

423
00:16:48,429 --> 00:16:50,709
people live basically it's near palo

424
00:16:50,709 --> 00:16:53,079
alto it's your Mountain View Cupertino

425
00:16:53,079 --> 00:16:54,699
it's where California's tech industry is

426
00:16:54,699 --> 00:16:56,649
it's where the industry is that

427
00:16:56,649 --> 00:16:59,619
basically dominates the web where

428
00:16:59,619 --> 00:17:01,119
seventy percent of the residents have an

429
00:17:01,119 --> 00:17:03,549
advanced degree I think we're becoming a

430
00:17:03,549 --> 00:17:06,429
bit like a community like fat a bit

431
00:17:06,429 --> 00:17:08,169
increasingly you know incestuous a

432
00:17:08,169 --> 00:17:09,819
little bit detached a bit self

433
00:17:09,819 --> 00:17:11,889
referential I feel it's only natural

434
00:17:11,889 --> 00:17:13,110
especially the self-referential

435
00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:15,639
referential ality bit comes with the

436
00:17:15,639 --> 00:17:18,699
territory I'm willing to bet money that

437
00:17:18,699 --> 00:17:20,679
most software especially open-source

438
00:17:20,679 --> 00:17:21,970
software was made out of the same

439
00:17:21,970 --> 00:17:25,839
motivation personal need scratch your

440
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:27,429
own itch dogfooding those are fixed

441
00:17:27,429 --> 00:17:29,559
terms in our industry for a reason most

442
00:17:29,559 --> 00:17:31,240
of what we build we build first and

443
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:34,419
foremost for ourselves and I'm sure sir

444
00:17:34,419 --> 00:17:36,010
tim and only the best intentions when he

445
00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:37,389
implemented the first web server a

446
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:39,549
quarter century ago at CERN but

447
00:17:39,549 --> 00:17:41,200
fundamentally he was building a tool to

448
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,789
solve his problems and the problems of

449
00:17:42,789 --> 00:17:47,820
his peers nowadays when we build tools

450
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:50,440
we solve our problems and the problems

451
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:52,539
of our peers we build tools for web

452
00:17:52,539 --> 00:17:54,970
developers now wonder our two kids are

453
00:17:54,970 --> 00:17:57,250
growing at such ridiculous rates that's

454
00:17:57,250 --> 00:18:02,700
somebody's random grunt file off github

455
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:04,940
every day we get more and more tools

456
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:06,980
tailored to address increasingly

457
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:08,660
specific problems in many cases

458
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:10,010
inventing those problems in the first

459
00:18:10,010 --> 00:18:14,540
place and at the same time view source

460
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:16,400
that's vanishing into the developer menu

461
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,080
making the web is becoming a profession

462
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,790
with professionalizing this to it to a

463
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:22,820
scary degree anything and for an

464
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:23,900
increasing number of people it's not

465
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:25,400
going to be this thing we easily

466
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:28,130
discover on the side where you can be

467
00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:29,420
self-taught and look at other people's

468
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:31,180
code like i did in probably many of you

469
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:34,580
it's going to be a career choice view

470
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:37,130
source even if it still exists i don't

471
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:38,450
think it helps beginners anymore those

472
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:42,410
times will be behind us in a way yes our

473
00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:44,270
work is becoming increasingly more

474
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:45,740
complex and complicated and let people

475
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:47,450
expect that of us and they pay us for it

476
00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:49,370
makes total sense that our tools and

477
00:18:49,370 --> 00:18:51,710
workflows keep up with that at the same

478
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:53,120
time we're leaving everyone else behind

479
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:57,470
I think it requires an empathic leap a

480
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:58,940
change of perspective to realize that

481
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:00,230
other people have different needs than

482
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:02,720
we do and then maybe it's our job as the

483
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:03,950
people with this power that is our

484
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:06,560
responsibility on top of a regular job

485
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:11,030
to accommodate them somehow I think

486
00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:12,980
we've most certainly got an empathy

487
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:15,110
problem I go so far as to say its

488
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:17,030
intrinsic to this industry partially

489
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:18,740
because of how much of our work is this

490
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:20,390
scratch around each type and we're very

491
00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:22,250
focused on ourselves and people like us

492
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:24,770
and partially maybe because programming

493
00:19:24,770 --> 00:19:25,730
has always been a bit of an infra

494
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:27,770
introverts activity if I may further

495
00:19:27,770 --> 00:19:30,380
that cliche I mean we actively outsource

496
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:33,080
empathy to other people we hire product

497
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:35,060
designers graphic designers UI and UX

498
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:37,040
experts and business consultants we hire

499
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:38,420
them to make empathic connections to

500
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:40,890
other humans so we don't have to

501
00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:42,900
so we can keep coding because that's

502
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:44,520
what we do we work with tech and tech

503
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:45,960
does what we tell it to mostly and

504
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,430
that's a pleasant experience and people

505
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:50,850
are complicated anyway at the same time

506
00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:52,500
we see the people who make the empathic

507
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:55,950
connections as inferior in a way we

508
00:19:55,950 --> 00:19:58,140
value their work less than our own

509
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:02,250
because those are soft goals right and

510
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:03,960
that's fine somehow in a company or

511
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,640
product context but an open source it

512
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,800
really becomes a problem because an open

513
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:10,050
source we project our work and to avoid

514
00:20:10,050 --> 00:20:12,510
most of what comes back is from people

515
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:15,990
who are exactly like us it's not really

516
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:18,150
everyone's issues is it it's only the

517
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:21,810
issues of people like us so we're not

518
00:20:21,810 --> 00:20:23,340
only losing our perspective on our place

519
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:25,290
and time we're also losing our

520
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:26,430
perspective on a place among other

521
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:34,710
humans part 3 Hotel California thinking

522
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:37,560
about the future is hard it's hard as an

523
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:40,260
individual those for me it is because

524
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:41,880
I've completely embraced this notion of

525
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,170
that everything changes all the time

526
00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:44,610
forever and that the only viable

527
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:46,590
strategy for living in life is being

528
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:49,830
highly adaptable but that makes it hard

529
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:53,280
to make plans but I think thinking about

530
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,330
the future and group is even more

531
00:20:54,330 --> 00:20:56,910
complicated and we're all in our in our

532
00:20:56,910 --> 00:20:58,260
own little circle here but I suspect

533
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:00,090
we'd have trouble formulating a vision

534
00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:02,670
of the future web that goes beyond some

535
00:21:02,670 --> 00:21:04,860
open source buzzwords like you know free

536
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:08,640
open secure private may be decentralized

537
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,610
who knows because thinking about the

538
00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:13,260
future is not only hard it's a bloody

539
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:19,960
minefield but never actually said that

540
00:21:19,970 --> 00:21:21,930
seriously the thinking about future is

541
00:21:21,930 --> 00:21:26,390
hard he's crop weirdly isn't any way

542
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:28,560
there are conceptual tools we can use

543
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:30,360
and I'd like to use one from the

544
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:33,750
discipline of speculative design so we

545
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:35,460
can agree that the future is vast and

546
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,140
unknowable but we can narrow down our

547
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:39,540
idea of how things might turn out by

548
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:41,460
incrementally iterating through variants

549
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:42,930
of the future that become increasingly

550
00:21:42,930 --> 00:21:46,650
likely so you start with the present and

551
00:21:46,650 --> 00:21:48,360
then you have this vast scope of things

552
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:49,520
that up

553
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:52,340
possible basically any of it narrower

554
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:53,840
scope of things that are plausible and

555
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,160
an even narrower scope of things that

556
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:59,720
are probable and then we recall Alan Kay

557
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,880
from Park who said the best way to

558
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,560
predict the future is to invent it and

559
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:07,750
therefore we have the preferable future

560
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:09,950
what kind of future do we want for

561
00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:13,220
ourselves now again we're a diverse lot

562
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:17,030
and probably be a lot of arguments what

563
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:19,370
we can more easily do than trying to

564
00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:23,420
think about our own future is to

565
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:24,740
hypothesize about other entities

566
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:26,300
preferable futures other noteworthy

567
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:28,280
entities on the web like Google Facebook

568
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:33,110
Apple Amazon various governments so what

569
00:22:33,110 --> 00:22:34,460
kind of web would they like to have in

570
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:36,530
20 years and how will they as wealthy

571
00:22:36,530 --> 00:22:38,180
resourceful systems that wish to ensure

572
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:39,830
their own survival and prosperity make

573
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:42,080
sure they're still around here's the

574
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,820
future I can see these huge entities

575
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:47,840
being happy with with a future that's

576
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:50,780
more closed uncertain all of them will

577
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:52,310
be completely fine with a more closed

578
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:53,630
web and some of them will actively

579
00:22:53,630 --> 00:22:55,940
pursue it because in their view closed

580
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:57,610
ecosystems with vendor lock-in

581
00:22:57,610 --> 00:22:59,570
consolidate different usage patterns

582
00:22:59,570 --> 00:23:01,130
into one provide and promised greater

583
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:02,750
use of attention because if you can't

584
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:04,970
leave what you're going to do will stay

585
00:23:04,970 --> 00:23:08,780
a future that is more invasive because

586
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:10,400
ads are still the main way of making

587
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,810
money on the web services will be

588
00:23:11,810 --> 00:23:13,400
increasingly invasive because the more

589
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,560
they can find out about users the better

590
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:18,050
they can target ads towards you and make

591
00:23:18,050 --> 00:23:20,330
more money so the latest development is

592
00:23:20,330 --> 00:23:22,160
facebook on android take increasing

593
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,960
liberties in this regard the current

594
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:25,520
version actually has full access to all

595
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,980
of your text messages why would they

596
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:31,430
want those so the third aspects of their

597
00:23:31,430 --> 00:23:33,620
prayer for the futures maybe something

598
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:35,180
like future that is more inaccessible

599
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:37,700
and laureen transparent the more you

600
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:39,590
restrict access the more tightly you can

601
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:41,930
control the experience and prevent users

602
00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:43,790
from leaving your service or using it in

603
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:45,800
an undesirable way it also makes

604
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:48,920
monetization easier and i think that

605
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,780
services and devices will start making

606
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:53,210
choices for you in part because they

607
00:23:53,210 --> 00:23:56,420
don't trust you maybe that's one of the

608
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:58,790
things one of the reasons why facebook

609
00:23:58,790 --> 00:24:00,560
wants to look at your text messages

610
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:02,060
maybe they don't trust what you write in

611
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:02,870
your profile

612
00:24:02,870 --> 00:24:04,340
and they'd like to check for themselves

613
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:07,930
a future that's more tightly controlled

614
00:24:07,930 --> 00:24:10,100
from governments to corporations

615
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:11,780
everyone is interested in more control

616
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:13,910
beard implicit or explicit and for the

617
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:15,440
tightest control you need not only

618
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,750
completely closed software you also need

619
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:19,940
completely closed hardware and in that

620
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:22,100
light it's interesting to look at

621
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:23,960
Facebook's oculus a closet acquisition

622
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:26,660
the betting the basically betting a

623
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:29,120
non-trivial amount of money yet

624
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:30,830
ultimately insignificant in their scale

625
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:32,240
of four hundred million dollars in cash

626
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:37,250
plus 1.6 million what did I say 400 yeah

627
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:40,790
one no oh god that's a lot of money see

628
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:42,110
I can't even read it correctly anyway

629
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:44,300
amazing amounts of money two billion all

630
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:46,940
in all there basically betting on

631
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:49,730
virtual reality becoming the nips next

632
00:24:49,730 --> 00:24:51,590
step in content consumption technology

633
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:54,740
it's a bet that the way we moved from

634
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:56,510
desktop to mobile will be moving from

635
00:24:56,510 --> 00:25:00,860
mobile to VR in the future don't know if

636
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:02,210
it's going to happen but will that still

637
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:06,050
be the web what is going to happen

638
00:25:06,050 --> 00:25:07,130
though is that they want to make sure

639
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:08,690
that they own and control the hardware

640
00:25:08,690 --> 00:25:10,550
and they want to make sure it runs their

641
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:13,190
software under their terms and consider

642
00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:14,540
this in the light that these services

643
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:16,340
are always trying to consolidate use as

644
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:19,100
many relevant usages as possible unified

645
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:22,309
into one provider you can already lead a

646
00:25:22,309 --> 00:25:24,350
really involve digital life using only

647
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:26,120
google products it's convenient and it's

648
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:28,010
seamless and it's hard to resist because

649
00:25:28,010 --> 00:25:30,679
it's just really well-made and at the

650
00:25:30,679 --> 00:25:32,450
same time in many developing nations

651
00:25:32,450 --> 00:25:34,670
Facebook has become orbit synonymous

652
00:25:34,670 --> 00:25:36,679
with the web there are ethnographic

653
00:25:36,679 --> 00:25:38,120
studies from Trinidad in Kenya that

654
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:39,740
document her poor people's web users

655
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:41,330
practically exclusive to Facebook

656
00:25:41,330 --> 00:25:43,400
because it lets them do everything at

657
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:49,160
the same time at lower costs findings

658
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:50,510
from our fieldwork suggests that

659
00:25:50,510 --> 00:25:52,550
residents similarly consolidate diverse

660
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:54,550
activities into a single online platform

661
00:25:54,550 --> 00:25:57,290
now this is from Facebook use in an

662
00:25:57,290 --> 00:25:58,970
informal settlement in Nairobi and

663
00:25:58,970 --> 00:26:01,160
informal settlement as a euphemism for

664
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:04,010
slum also known as a place where half of

665
00:26:04,010 --> 00:26:06,230
humanity lives and they're using

666
00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:09,860
Facebook it's undoubtedly Facebook

667
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:11,570
strategy to become more than than just a

668
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:14,390
website to become just as Google and

669
00:26:14,390 --> 00:26:15,650
Amazon want to be more than a collection

670
00:26:15,650 --> 00:26:16,039
of

671
00:26:16,039 --> 00:26:18,229
I want to be platforms they want to be

672
00:26:18,229 --> 00:26:21,080
ecosystems ecosystems that extend into

673
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:23,479
the real world with virtual reality and

674
00:26:23,479 --> 00:26:25,249
glass and the self-driving car and that

675
00:26:25,249 --> 00:26:27,830
magical barcode reading wavy stick thing

676
00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:29,479
from amazon that you just wave around

677
00:26:29,479 --> 00:26:30,559
the house and then it restocks your

678
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:35,090
fridge and glass and all of these

679
00:26:35,090 --> 00:26:37,519
they're perfect examples of manifested

680
00:26:37,519 --> 00:26:39,739
preferable futures they might all fail

681
00:26:39,739 --> 00:26:41,690
but their show is really well what these

682
00:26:41,690 --> 00:26:45,200
people want they want to completely

683
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,659
surround you in their service and be

684
00:26:47,659 --> 00:26:49,159
your main or even only gateway to the

685
00:26:49,159 --> 00:26:51,590
virtual world but the same way bleeding

686
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:52,909
into the physical world and sometimes

687
00:26:52,909 --> 00:26:54,499
they get help from really unexpected

688
00:26:54,499 --> 00:26:58,129
places here's an Indian telco that's

689
00:26:58,129 --> 00:26:59,840
moving from volume based products where

690
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:02,119
they charge you per gigabyte to service

691
00:27:02,119 --> 00:27:05,389
based products wait where the cheapest

692
00:27:05,389 --> 00:27:07,519
thing you can get there now is just

693
00:27:07,519 --> 00:27:11,539
facebook and or whatsapp and that's

694
00:27:11,539 --> 00:27:13,399
totally fine for people whose web use is

695
00:27:13,399 --> 00:27:14,869
already consolidated into facebook

696
00:27:14,869 --> 00:27:17,739
that's going to be their web done period

697
00:27:17,739 --> 00:27:22,340
and all of these big players these

698
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:24,049
stacks they have amazing talent

699
00:27:24,049 --> 00:27:25,940
practically limitless resources and a

700
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:28,309
strong will for self-preservation if

701
00:27:28,309 --> 00:27:29,690
you're still comparing facebook demise

702
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:30,889
base and thinking it's going to go away

703
00:27:30,889 --> 00:27:32,929
at some point you're massively under

704
00:27:32,929 --> 00:27:34,789
estimating how aware they are their own

705
00:27:34,789 --> 00:27:36,229
mortality and the lengths they will go

706
00:27:36,229 --> 00:27:39,229
to to survive like paying 19 billion

707
00:27:39,229 --> 00:27:42,950
dollars for whatsapp and oddly enough

708
00:27:42,950 --> 00:27:44,119
there seems to be quite a lot of

709
00:27:44,119 --> 00:27:45,919
optimism about this in in our industry

710
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:48,229
so here's an ill dash saying we'll fix

711
00:27:48,229 --> 00:27:51,979
these things I don't worry about that

712
00:27:51,979 --> 00:27:53,570
the technology industry like all

713
00:27:53,570 --> 00:27:55,820
industries follow cycles the pendulum is

714
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:57,259
swinging back to the broad and powering

715
00:27:57,259 --> 00:27:58,940
philosophies that underpin the early

716
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:02,320
social web and I no longer believe this

717
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:04,999
these cycles aren't inherently systemic

718
00:28:04,999 --> 00:28:06,499
in my view they happen because there are

719
00:28:06,499 --> 00:28:08,539
people and institutions pulling the

720
00:28:08,539 --> 00:28:10,849
pendulum in their direction knowingly or

721
00:28:10,849 --> 00:28:12,799
unknowingly and this tug of war is

722
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:17,570
becoming increasingly lopsided most used

723
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:20,119
websites / country red is google blue is

724
00:28:20,119 --> 00:28:23,749
Facebook that's a bit depressing this

725
00:28:23,749 --> 00:28:26,389
time it's different I think even if you

726
00:28:26,389 --> 00:28:28,309
believe that the open source world can

727
00:28:28,309 --> 00:28:29,589
build an e resist

728
00:28:29,589 --> 00:28:31,609
decentralized secure and private

729
00:28:31,609 --> 00:28:36,229
alternative to that or if you believe

730
00:28:36,229 --> 00:28:37,399
that you know sharing may suddenly

731
00:28:37,399 --> 00:28:39,709
become uncool or you know startup

732
00:28:39,709 --> 00:28:41,659
funding becomes uncool or some major

733
00:28:41,659 --> 00:28:43,399
regulatory action suddenly cripples

734
00:28:43,399 --> 00:28:45,559
these giants there is one almost

735
00:28:45,559 --> 00:28:47,839
geological trend that I don't think

736
00:28:47,839 --> 00:28:50,389
anyone can slow or stop and that's a

737
00:28:50,389 --> 00:28:52,190
trend to the consumer device you can

738
00:28:52,190 --> 00:28:54,289
call the phone or tablet if you like but

739
00:28:54,289 --> 00:28:55,669
its consumer because it's a one-way

740
00:28:55,669 --> 00:28:58,039
thing you can only consume services you

741
00:28:58,039 --> 00:29:02,059
can't create them while the desktop is a

742
00:29:02,059 --> 00:29:03,889
veritable do anything machine and it's

743
00:29:03,889 --> 00:29:05,359
open and your options are basically

744
00:29:05,359 --> 00:29:07,579
unlimited a tablet or a phone is still

745
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:09,919
an amazingly powerful tool I know people

746
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:12,109
who basically lead their entire life off

747
00:29:12,109 --> 00:29:14,989
an ipad it works just fine for them but

748
00:29:14,989 --> 00:29:17,450
it is more closed and the form factor

749
00:29:17,450 --> 00:29:19,219
simply does limit what you can do with

750
00:29:19,219 --> 00:29:22,159
it and this is just as true of an open

751
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:23,959
Firefox phone as it is of a closed

752
00:29:23,959 --> 00:29:27,049
iPhone they are designed for consumption

753
00:29:27,049 --> 00:29:30,259
and not production there's no view

754
00:29:30,259 --> 00:29:33,019
source menu item in there and there's no

755
00:29:33,019 --> 00:29:35,389
view source menu item Google glass and

756
00:29:35,389 --> 00:29:36,889
there won't be one of Facebook's oculus

757
00:29:36,889 --> 00:29:38,329
and there won't be one in any of the

758
00:29:38,329 --> 00:29:40,700
increasingly d materialized devices we

759
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:45,019
use to access the network the internet

760
00:29:45,019 --> 00:29:46,669
will become more pervasive but less

761
00:29:46,669 --> 00:29:48,649
explicit and visible it will to some

762
00:29:48,649 --> 00:29:50,179
extent blend into the background of all

763
00:29:50,179 --> 00:29:54,079
we do so these consumer devices are a

764
00:29:54,079 --> 00:29:56,089
thing than I fear that our team is

765
00:29:56,089 --> 00:29:58,339
shrinking most people starting with the

766
00:29:58,339 --> 00:30:00,950
web today only know this consumer side

767
00:30:00,950 --> 00:30:03,769
from their consumer device there's a

768
00:30:03,769 --> 00:30:05,359
saying that the entire continent of

769
00:30:05,359 --> 00:30:07,729
Africa is practically mobile only it's

770
00:30:07,729 --> 00:30:10,570
not even mobile first it's mobile only

771
00:30:10,570 --> 00:30:13,369
new web users can't really see it for

772
00:30:13,369 --> 00:30:15,679
what we see it as this wondrous

773
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:17,329
malleable thing that anyone can shape

774
00:30:17,329 --> 00:30:19,909
don't know its history or its promise if

775
00:30:19,909 --> 00:30:21,919
Facebook is your entire web you're

776
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:23,690
holding that pendulum to the closed side

777
00:30:23,690 --> 00:30:25,129
and you kind of do anything about it

778
00:30:25,129 --> 00:30:28,399
because you don't know about it the web

779
00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:31,489
has been split into a wedge has been

780
00:30:31,489 --> 00:30:33,049
driven into the web thoroughly and

781
00:30:33,049 --> 00:30:35,209
deeply on the one hand we have the

782
00:30:35,209 --> 00:30:38,089
consumer web with little black boxes and

783
00:30:38,089 --> 00:30:40,279
a black cloud and monolithic stacks

784
00:30:40,279 --> 00:30:40,880
services

785
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,290
it's smooth and it's slick and it's

786
00:30:42,290 --> 00:30:44,150
well-made it's affordable it's easy to

787
00:30:44,150 --> 00:30:46,970
use it's very compelling on the other we

788
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:48,500
have the professional web where we all

789
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:52,130
hang out but the web the wedge is still

790
00:30:52,130 --> 00:30:54,140
moving and the more separate the two

791
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:55,970
parts become I think the more both will

792
00:30:55,970 --> 00:30:58,850
suffer the consumer web because it's

793
00:30:58,850 --> 00:31:00,400
becoming increasingly closed

794
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,960
consolidated access controlled and gate

795
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:05,720
kept on our side because our side will

796
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:08,270
simply continually shrink until it's

797
00:31:08,270 --> 00:31:09,680
only a factory to make stuff for the

798
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:18,890
other half end of part 3 this consumer

799
00:31:18,890 --> 00:31:21,950
web it's closer to TV than it is to our

800
00:31:21,950 --> 00:31:25,040
web now everyone's a channel but apart

801
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:26,660
from that it's as much a black box as a

802
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:29,120
TVs Inc ordered a black cloud really

803
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:31,220
money and time go in and Taemin comes

804
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:34,130
out and we have no idea or control what

805
00:31:34,130 --> 00:31:37,640
happens in between internet internal

806
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:40,280
access to this box is reserved for

807
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:41,630
specially educated people and the

808
00:31:41,630 --> 00:31:44,330
companies they work for and just having

809
00:31:44,330 --> 00:31:46,580
the ability to create content for this

810
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:49,190
medium doesn't make her mobile devices

811
00:31:49,190 --> 00:31:53,000
much more than many televisions where

812
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,590
our services and content produced and

813
00:31:54,590 --> 00:31:55,880
selected who decides what comes through

814
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:57,950
and what doesn't access control

815
00:31:57,950 --> 00:31:59,960
filtering and censorship cannon will be

816
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:02,450
Semak Lee inherent as will surveillance

817
00:32:02,450 --> 00:32:04,220
and we won't even be able to tell

818
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:06,500
because the system is closed and if all

819
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:07,880
you have to access the system is your

820
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:10,760
phone well that's it you can't find out

821
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:14,420
more right now the internet is headed

822
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:15,350
towards a highly commercialized

823
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:17,360
profit-driven opaque and privatized

824
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:18,980
domain much like the mass media of the

825
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:28,780
1980s part 4 where did it all go wrong

826
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:35,330
so we did everything right didn't we we

827
00:32:35,330 --> 00:32:37,280
the web aficionados the open source

828
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:40,070
community data privacy paladin's we

829
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:41,960
warned everyone repeatedly over the

830
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:44,660
years we wrote more secure peer-reviewed

831
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:46,970
alternatives we even generously gave it

832
00:32:46,970 --> 00:32:49,070
all away for free and yet in the

833
00:32:49,070 --> 00:32:51,059
consumer space open source hasn't

834
00:32:51,059 --> 00:32:52,919
one everyone's using Facebook what the

835
00:32:52,919 --> 00:32:56,100
hell regular people suck why haven't we

836
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:57,749
already had the year of linux on the

837
00:32:57,749 --> 00:33:00,029
desktop I mean it's clearly superior why

838
00:33:00,029 --> 00:33:02,999
doesn't everyone PGP their emails you

839
00:33:02,999 --> 00:33:03,899
didn't really think they weren't

840
00:33:03,899 --> 00:33:06,299
intercepting everything do you you can

841
00:33:06,299 --> 00:33:07,830
use ab dot net that'll solve all your

842
00:33:07,830 --> 00:33:10,830
problems it's all right there but no

843
00:33:10,830 --> 00:33:14,159
it's not the solution so regular people

844
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:16,139
aren't the problem right must be the

845
00:33:16,139 --> 00:33:19,679
opposite vent open source sucks ah I

846
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:21,480
love open source too much to leave that

847
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:24,210
up there I'm endlessly thankful for all

848
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:26,399
the time saved and abilities I've gotten

849
00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:28,470
through open source it's practically

850
00:33:28,470 --> 00:33:30,990
exclusive to my side as a developer and

851
00:33:30,990 --> 00:33:32,700
a generally nerdy computer person I

852
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:35,519
think open source does a lot for many

853
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:37,559
people but it rarely touches people

854
00:33:37,559 --> 00:33:41,940
outside of our demographic so to make

855
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:44,009
this more precise open source sucks for

856
00:33:44,009 --> 00:33:47,100
this type of a problem for the problem

857
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:49,080
of providing good alternatives to the

858
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:51,869
stacks of building an open free secure

859
00:33:51,869 --> 00:33:54,090
private and ideally properly

860
00:33:54,090 --> 00:33:59,269
decentralized web is why lack of empathy

861
00:33:59,269 --> 00:34:01,980
again we graciously scatter our work on

862
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:03,600
the earth expecting the unwashed masses

863
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,789
to flock to us take up a half-finished

864
00:34:05,789 --> 00:34:07,740
and often seriously shonky tools and

865
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:09,569
make a better world with them at the

866
00:34:09,569 --> 00:34:11,159
same time we patronize them for needing

867
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:12,780
a helper when they can't figure out how

868
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:15,690
they work that's wrong we took it as

869
00:34:15,690 --> 00:34:17,700
self evident and obvious that people

870
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:19,649
would even want to participate in this

871
00:34:19,649 --> 00:34:21,030
medium instead of doing the hard work

872
00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:22,619
necessary to make it a welcoming and

873
00:34:22,619 --> 00:34:24,119
rewarding place for the rest of the

874
00:34:24,119 --> 00:34:27,750
world it's just the the cherry on top of

875
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:30,050
this ice cream sundae of egocentricity

876
00:34:30,050 --> 00:34:31,919
expecting that everyone else would care

877
00:34:31,919 --> 00:34:33,899
about this as deeply as we do they don't

878
00:34:33,899 --> 00:34:36,510
they have other priorities in life oops

879
00:34:36,510 --> 00:34:39,000
I don't know what your first computing

880
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,429
experience was mine was that he wasn't

881
00:34:41,429 --> 00:34:42,869
have been ready on a blue screen or

882
00:34:42,869 --> 00:34:45,450
something in any case if you're my age

883
00:34:45,450 --> 00:34:47,339
it was probably a black prompt and

884
00:34:47,339 --> 00:34:49,409
that's a system with a learning curve

885
00:34:49,409 --> 00:34:52,190
that very closely resembles a brick wall

886
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:55,260
so to us though for lack of any

887
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:58,230
alternatives that represents a great

888
00:34:58,230 --> 00:35:00,420
opportunity it's lots of fiddly rubbish

889
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:02,819
and pain but we saw great opportunities

890
00:35:02,819 --> 00:35:05,609
that's not a majority opinion especially

891
00:35:05,609 --> 00:35:07,890
not today nowadays many people's first

892
00:35:07,890 --> 00:35:10,049
and only computing experience as a phone

893
00:35:10,049 --> 00:35:12,599
and they love it and you shouldn't ever

894
00:35:12,599 --> 00:35:14,190
fault them for it because they're not

895
00:35:14,190 --> 00:35:16,170
lazy and they're not done all they want

896
00:35:16,170 --> 00:35:18,299
is a good experience and they want to be

897
00:35:18,299 --> 00:35:20,819
empowered and that might be hard for us

898
00:35:20,819 --> 00:35:23,790
to understand given our tools and our

899
00:35:23,790 --> 00:35:25,589
history with these super powerful tools

900
00:35:25,589 --> 00:35:27,780
that give us total flexibility at the

901
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:30,180
price of usability but we can deal with

902
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:32,280
it because we're used to the pain and we

903
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:33,569
kind of expect everyone else to go

904
00:35:33,569 --> 00:35:35,760
through the same thing but if we had

905
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,920
have had at if we had had iphones as

906
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:41,069
alternatives back then i think many of

907
00:35:41,069 --> 00:35:44,480
us wouldn't be here today second problem

908
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,710
believing that technology will save us

909
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:49,170
all and really this goes all the way

910
00:35:49,170 --> 00:35:51,960
back to the catalog and the well as tech

911
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:53,280
people we put a lot of faith in

912
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:55,349
technology it's been good to us we owe

913
00:35:55,349 --> 00:35:57,720
it a lot but just having something that

914
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:59,430
works for us and then expecting everyone

915
00:35:59,430 --> 00:36:02,849
else to use it that doesn't cut it arab

916
00:36:02,849 --> 00:36:05,000
al can cause a trickle-down technology

917
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,920
so you make stuff for the elite and you

918
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,150
believe that will eventually trickle

919
00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:10,740
down to the masses it's like

920
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:12,089
trickle-down economics where you make

921
00:36:12,089 --> 00:36:14,280
rich people richer and you think at some

922
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,390
point what's going to arrive at the

923
00:36:15,390 --> 00:36:17,430
bottom so now and just like trickle-down

924
00:36:17,430 --> 00:36:20,250
economics that doesn't work so who

925
00:36:20,250 --> 00:36:22,770
really benefits from our openness it's

926
00:36:22,770 --> 00:36:25,140
other people I guess and it's companies

927
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:27,599
we employ people like us companies

928
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:28,859
profits so much from open source

929
00:36:28,859 --> 00:36:30,900
consequently they fund or maintain large

930
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:33,420
parts of many other big big projects and

931
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:35,220
again I realize that much of the basic

932
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:37,410
underlying infrastructure of the web is

933
00:36:37,410 --> 00:36:39,630
open source and that is obviously a

934
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:41,579
benefit to everyone but again I'm

935
00:36:41,579 --> 00:36:43,200
talking about the places where people

936
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:47,940
directly interact with software in the

937
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:51,270
end none of that really helps propagate

938
00:36:51,270 --> 00:36:52,829
the original values of the web you know

939
00:36:52,829 --> 00:36:55,049
this is for everyone not just for web

940
00:36:55,049 --> 00:37:01,079
developers for everyone it doesn't help

941
00:37:01,079 --> 00:37:03,060
fulfill this empowerment promise of the

942
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:05,280
web it makes us feel good and they leave

943
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:07,530
and never learnt and helpful yes but

944
00:37:07,530 --> 00:37:10,230
none of all this really reaches people

945
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:12,940
outside of our circles

946
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:15,220
and much of this tech evolves over time

947
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:17,140
often without a clear goal mostly in

948
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:19,780
reaction to other processes was often

949
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:22,300
never proactively designed to be usable

950
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:23,680
it was made to solve a specific problem

951
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:25,810
and then people just took it and did

952
00:37:25,810 --> 00:37:27,099
things to it and solve other problems

953
00:37:27,099 --> 00:37:29,980
with it and it's always unforeseen

954
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:32,470
issues and usages we always build in

955
00:37:32,470 --> 00:37:35,260
reaction to a problem or on top of some

956
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:36,819
exciting tech just for the sake of it

957
00:37:36,819 --> 00:37:39,250
but rarely does any of our building

958
00:37:39,250 --> 00:37:42,099
truly start with a human side and

959
00:37:42,099 --> 00:37:44,560
another aspect of this tech focused

960
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:49,180
nurses this idea of meritocracy we're so

961
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:51,099
text entered the main aspect that

962
00:37:51,099 --> 00:37:53,190
matters in a person is their tech output

963
00:37:53,190 --> 00:37:55,420
doesn't matter in a meritocracy it

964
00:37:55,420 --> 00:37:56,589
doesn't matter how awful you are as a

965
00:37:56,589 --> 00:37:58,839
person as long as your code is good but

966
00:37:58,839 --> 00:38:00,910
conversely that means if you write good

967
00:38:00,910 --> 00:38:02,560
code you can be an utter bastard to

968
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:04,300
people and most of your peers will still

969
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:07,089
respect you and that's a lousy set of

970
00:38:07,089 --> 00:38:09,310
values and a great deterrent to reaching

971
00:38:09,310 --> 00:38:13,410
more people and it's a huge problem OOP

972
00:38:13,410 --> 00:38:15,819
culture matters it's not just what you

973
00:38:15,819 --> 00:38:19,349
do it's how you do it third thing

974
00:38:19,349 --> 00:38:22,750
hypocrisy do you encrypt all your emails

975
00:38:22,750 --> 00:38:25,599
I don't have you sworn off all

976
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:27,400
centralized services deleted your

977
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:28,540
facebook google and twitter accounts

978
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:31,390
because i haven't I adventure all of you

979
00:38:31,390 --> 00:38:33,369
use Twitter most of you use Facebook and

980
00:38:33,369 --> 00:38:34,990
most of you probably use at least five

981
00:38:34,990 --> 00:38:37,660
Google services a day so how persuasive

982
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:39,490
does that make us when we speak of the

983
00:38:39,490 --> 00:38:41,800
open and free web how could we really

984
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:43,300
ever convince anyone that we really

985
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:44,859
believe in this secure private

986
00:38:44,859 --> 00:38:48,880
decentralized thing our daily behavior

987
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,589
just confirms how important good

988
00:38:50,589 --> 00:38:52,960
experiences are if you can we can't

989
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,640
resist the allure of the big stacks and

990
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:56,260
the huge companies how can we truly

991
00:38:56,260 --> 00:38:58,780
expect anyone else to they empower us to

992
00:38:58,780 --> 00:39:01,930
to ride them as much as we will the

993
00:39:01,930 --> 00:39:03,579
tools we propagate are often too

994
00:39:03,579 --> 00:39:05,790
inconvenient even for people like us

995
00:39:05,790 --> 00:39:07,780
especially in contrast to the Polish

996
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:11,710
consumer stuff so seen from the outside

997
00:39:11,710 --> 00:39:15,550
from other people's perspectives who are

998
00:39:15,550 --> 00:39:17,230
not part of the tech industry what what

999
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:22,329
does this look like that doesn't sound

1000
00:39:22,329 --> 00:39:23,360
good

1001
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:25,520
that sounds depressing and it leads it

1002
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:27,200
leads to a super weird schism because on

1003
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:28,910
the one hand you have this amazing

1004
00:39:28,910 --> 00:39:31,100
occasionally very altruistic open source

1005
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:33,140
idea which is so cool it regularly

1006
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:34,700
floors people when I tell non tech

1007
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:36,920
people about how it works if there's

1008
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:38,570
wonderful global results-oriented

1009
00:39:38,570 --> 00:39:41,330
collaboration and structural agreements

1010
00:39:41,330 --> 00:39:43,250
that benefit everyone it's brilliant and

1011
00:39:43,250 --> 00:39:44,600
I'd really like to see it in other

1012
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:46,940
realms on the other hand we have a

1013
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:48,920
culture that is often intrinsically

1014
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:51,620
condescending unempowered are too often

1015
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:55,520
straight-out misogynistic so neither

1016
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:58,280
what we make nor how we are was or is

1017
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:00,020
especially attractive to people outside

1018
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:01,700
our peer group to get their hands on

1019
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:06,080
directly culture we have is often

1020
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:08,840
ideologically naive and it ranges from

1021
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:10,580
obtuse and unapproachable to

1022
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:13,490
occasionally plain our style and it's no

1023
00:40:13,490 --> 00:40:16,070
wonder that no one cares no wonder they

1024
00:40:16,070 --> 00:40:17,630
all go to the highly polished beautiful

1025
00:40:17,630 --> 00:40:25,800
services par 5 where do we go from here

1026
00:40:25,810 --> 00:40:27,620
tragically we're a bit late to our own

1027
00:40:27,620 --> 00:40:30,620
party the consumer web in my opinion

1028
00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:32,600
it's a thing and it's going to become

1029
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:35,510
more other thing that's done and I don't

1030
00:40:35,510 --> 00:40:37,850
see it going away but we're still

1031
00:40:37,850 --> 00:40:39,550
somewhat in control of the other half

1032
00:40:39,550 --> 00:40:43,070
professional web and by necessity it's

1033
00:40:43,070 --> 00:40:44,450
going to stay open and more accessible

1034
00:40:44,450 --> 00:40:47,030
at least technically accessible for

1035
00:40:47,030 --> 00:40:49,760
longer culturally low I think it's too

1036
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:52,550
closed I'd much rather we turn it to a

1037
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:55,280
producer web something that's culturally

1038
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:58,450
and socially accessible welcoming and

1039
00:40:58,450 --> 00:41:01,250
truly open to all of any skill level of

1040
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:03,350
any language of any gender and that

1041
00:41:03,350 --> 00:41:05,240
doesn't necessarily have anything to do

1042
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:07,790
with altruism if we want this open web

1043
00:41:07,790 --> 00:41:10,880
we need to populate it with people who

1044
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:14,110
care about it otherwise there's no point

1045
00:41:14,110 --> 00:41:16,580
so what can you do

1046
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:19,400
I want to briefly show two things we do

1047
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:21,320
at hoodie so I'm going to talk about

1048
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:23,960
what your tiny bit that we do to

1049
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:25,910
increase accessibility to the technology

1050
00:41:25,910 --> 00:41:29,780
we make so very quickly if you haven't

1051
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:32,360
heard of it yet hoodie makes developing

1052
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:34,670
web apps easy and fast it's like jQuery

1053
00:41:34,670 --> 00:41:37,190
you include a library it gives a user

1054
00:41:37,190 --> 00:41:39,260
authentication data storage sink or five

1055
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:41,930
features and stuff and in development we

1056
00:41:41,930 --> 00:41:43,550
have a few concepts that guide how we

1057
00:41:43,550 --> 00:41:45,980
make things and i'd like to share two of

1058
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:47,780
those with you the first one is no

1059
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:51,200
back-end building web apps is complex

1060
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:53,390
business especially on the server side

1061
00:41:53,390 --> 00:41:54,350
we're dealing with a lot of

1062
00:41:54,350 --> 00:41:56,090
technological legacies some a

1063
00:41:56,090 --> 00:41:58,040
decades-old all different or acting upon

1064
00:41:58,040 --> 00:42:00,080
another it's difficult to get into it's

1065
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:02,780
very easy to get wrong it's daunting if

1066
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:05,720
not outright tutoring to beginners it's

1067
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:10,010
a huge barrier to entry so we looked at

1068
00:42:10,010 --> 00:42:12,800
what people wish they could do we saw

1069
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:14,450
that many people want the same basic

1070
00:42:14,450 --> 00:42:16,250
things out of web applications they want

1071
00:42:16,250 --> 00:42:18,140
to authenticate users they want data

1072
00:42:18,140 --> 00:42:20,150
sync they want to send a couple of males

1073
00:42:20,150 --> 00:42:22,490
and we thought man these things have

1074
00:42:22,490 --> 00:42:24,470
been around forever they really should

1075
00:42:24,470 --> 00:42:29,150
be easier what I'm trying to do is

1076
00:42:29,150 --> 00:42:31,850
really simple it shouldn't be hard all

1077
00:42:31,850 --> 00:42:34,070
computers are just carefully organized

1078
00:42:34,070 --> 00:42:36,650
sound everything is hard until somebody

1079
00:42:36,650 --> 00:42:39,470
makes it easy and we thought hate web

1080
00:42:39,470 --> 00:42:41,960
programmers we have power in this brown

1081
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:44,570
we can do this we can make it easier

1082
00:42:44,570 --> 00:42:47,000
it's all arbitrary it's all agreements

1083
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,160
between human beings we can agree on new

1084
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:52,180
things so we agreed on this promise

1085
00:42:52,180 --> 00:42:54,440
we'll let you build full-featured web

1086
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:56,030
apps from the client side and you don't

1087
00:42:56,030 --> 00:42:58,280
have to worry about the back end so we

1088
00:42:58,280 --> 00:42:59,590
want to give people a tool that

1089
00:42:59,590 --> 00:43:02,300
radically lowers the barrier to entry to

1090
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:04,460
building web apps making it easy to set

1091
00:43:04,460 --> 00:43:06,530
up quick to get going and if you can use

1092
00:43:06,530 --> 00:43:08,180
jQuery now you can probably build a

1093
00:43:08,180 --> 00:43:10,850
simple web app what we're trying to do

1094
00:43:10,850 --> 00:43:13,340
is build good tools and make them for

1095
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:16,760
people who aren't us to help us with it

1096
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:19,310
we have a second guiding principle dream

1097
00:43:19,310 --> 00:43:21,950
code that's an interface design

1098
00:43:21,950 --> 00:43:24,350
philosophy by interface we mean the API

1099
00:43:24,350 --> 00:43:26,420
so we're humans interface with our

1100
00:43:26,420 --> 00:43:28,430
software

1101
00:43:28,430 --> 00:43:29,600
instead of looking at all the technical

1102
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:31,220
features our stack has and thinking

1103
00:43:31,220 --> 00:43:33,440
about exposing them somehow we took the

1104
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:35,180
opposite approach again we looked at

1105
00:43:35,180 --> 00:43:37,880
what people wish they could do what's

1106
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:39,710
the best and simplest possible way to

1107
00:43:39,710 --> 00:43:42,500
for example sign up a new user how far

1108
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:44,420
can you abstract this how simple can you

1109
00:43:44,420 --> 00:43:47,560
make it why can't we just do this

1110
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:50,120
account signup you pass it user name and

1111
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:52,580
a password you should be done right it's

1112
00:43:52,580 --> 00:43:55,670
2014 and this is such fundamental task

1113
00:43:55,670 --> 00:43:57,350
to everything you want to do in the web

1114
00:43:57,350 --> 00:43:59,900
why is it still hard why is it not that

1115
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:04,010
simple so we made it that simple and the

1116
00:44:04,010 --> 00:44:05,600
implementation may be difficult or it

1117
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:07,370
may be easy it doesn't matter for the

1118
00:44:07,370 --> 00:44:09,020
person who uses it what matters is the

1119
00:44:09,020 --> 00:44:11,900
experience of using that and so that is

1120
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:14,690
a thing that works and you can do that

1121
00:44:14,690 --> 00:44:16,190
immediately there's no backend set up

1122
00:44:16,190 --> 00:44:17,780
there's no database schema you create in

1123
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:21,890
your hooding app and you go so what it

1124
00:44:21,890 --> 00:44:24,430
is in essence is user centered design

1125
00:44:24,430 --> 00:44:27,800
apply to code and not not to visual

1126
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:30,020
interfaces coupled with a bit of our own

1127
00:44:30,020 --> 00:44:33,530
preferable futures because everything is

1128
00:44:33,530 --> 00:44:36,050
hard until someone makes it easy build

1129
00:44:36,050 --> 00:44:38,270
could build good tools for people who

1130
00:44:38,270 --> 00:44:40,880
aren't you and remember that technology

1131
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:43,400
isn't enough if we want to change the

1132
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:46,640
web itself to build this free open

1133
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:50,300
secure private and decentralized web we

1134
00:44:50,300 --> 00:44:51,860
can either resign ourselves to doing it

1135
00:44:51,860 --> 00:44:54,560
in our own realm the pro web or we can

1136
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:56,120
take on the consumer web and try to

1137
00:44:56,120 --> 00:44:58,460
compete with the Giants with Facebook

1138
00:44:58,460 --> 00:45:00,800
with Google and Apple but we can't win

1139
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:02,540
on the features that aren't important to

1140
00:45:02,540 --> 00:45:05,930
us in fact it may well be useful to hide

1141
00:45:05,930 --> 00:45:08,180
the things we value most like you know

1142
00:45:08,180 --> 00:45:09,920
peer-to-peer encryption decentralized

1143
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:12,230
infrastructure etc because at recent

1144
00:45:12,230 --> 00:45:14,540
history is shown nobody cares enough

1145
00:45:14,540 --> 00:45:17,690
well even we do we care about the

1146
00:45:17,690 --> 00:45:18,980
principles but we don't want to make the

1147
00:45:18,980 --> 00:45:20,360
sacrifice we don't want to sacrifice

1148
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:23,270
convenience for security I mean even now

1149
00:45:23,270 --> 00:45:25,040
there are still people who make excuses

1150
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:26,420
because they're too lazy to use seat

1151
00:45:26,420 --> 00:45:29,540
belts it's the same phenomenon we have

1152
00:45:29,540 --> 00:45:33,050
to win through good experience tools and

1153
00:45:33,050 --> 00:45:35,090
services we make have to beat what

1154
00:45:35,090 --> 00:45:37,280
currently exists on user experience and

1155
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:39,140
convenience and all the auto P&I deals

1156
00:45:39,140 --> 00:45:40,750
we want to impose on

1157
00:45:40,750 --> 00:45:43,660
the web freedom openness security

1158
00:45:43,660 --> 00:45:45,760
decentralization they must be Trojan

1159
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:47,200
horses because they're not selling

1160
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:50,590
points to the average people and too

1161
00:45:50,590 --> 00:45:53,590
many of us thing out either and I think

1162
00:45:53,590 --> 00:45:55,240
we should provide an upgrade path for

1163
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:58,660
people to move from the consumer web to

1164
00:45:58,660 --> 00:46:00,970
the pro web so if you can find ways of

1165
00:46:00,970 --> 00:46:03,490
making the workings somewhat accessible

1166
00:46:03,490 --> 00:46:05,620
under a beautiful veneer of sensible

1167
00:46:05,620 --> 00:46:07,420
defaults and excellent user experience

1168
00:46:07,420 --> 00:46:09,220
and so much the better if we can invite

1169
00:46:09,220 --> 00:46:10,990
them over that's a good thing because

1170
00:46:10,990 --> 00:46:13,210
however of all types has become more

1171
00:46:13,210 --> 00:46:15,190
accessible to more people compared to

1172
00:46:15,190 --> 00:46:18,760
save the 70s produce a hardware like a

1173
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:22,120
proper PC just the rates of those exist

1174
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:23,590
existing in the world they just haven't

1175
00:46:23,590 --> 00:46:25,420
increased at the same rate as mobile but

1176
00:46:25,420 --> 00:46:30,070
it's more than they used to be so right

1177
00:46:30,070 --> 00:46:32,650
now today we can't see the thing at all

1178
00:46:32,650 --> 00:46:34,690
that's going to be the most important

1179
00:46:34,690 --> 00:46:36,040
one hundred years from now or even 10

1180
00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:38,080
years from now but whatever that thing

1181
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:41,380
is people will have to think it and we

1182
00:46:41,380 --> 00:46:44,350
can right now today prepare powerful

1183
00:46:44,350 --> 00:46:46,210
ways of thinking for these people we can

1184
00:46:46,210 --> 00:46:47,980
build the tools that make it possible to

1185
00:46:47,980 --> 00:46:50,620
think the thing and I see this as our

1186
00:46:50,620 --> 00:46:53,470
job because we have the power to do it

1187
00:46:53,470 --> 00:46:56,410
and with power comes responsibility in

1188
00:46:56,410 --> 00:46:58,090
this case because who else is going to

1189
00:46:58,090 --> 00:47:00,130
do it and when else's are going to be

1190
00:47:00,130 --> 00:47:04,440
done if not now it's our responsibility

1191
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:06,670
we are the people who are setting the

1192
00:47:06,670 --> 00:47:08,230
earliest patterns for this medium our

1193
00:47:08,230 --> 00:47:10,540
fate won't matter much but the norms we

1194
00:47:10,540 --> 00:47:12,610
set will and i don't mean technical

1195
00:47:12,610 --> 00:47:14,770
norms neither does he we've seen how

1196
00:47:14,770 --> 00:47:17,020
fleeting they can be but currently

1197
00:47:17,020 --> 00:47:18,910
there's a vacuum of cultural norms on in

1198
00:47:18,910 --> 00:47:21,220
our industry and the web apart from this

1199
00:47:21,220 --> 00:47:23,350
Californian ideology we have little to

1200
00:47:23,350 --> 00:47:25,720
offer and we can and must do better than

1201
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:34,849
that end of part 5

1202
00:47:34,859 --> 00:47:38,759
take a step outside yourself to close

1203
00:47:38,759 --> 00:47:40,750
let's look back at that satellite

1204
00:47:40,750 --> 00:47:42,819
picture it was the first of three

1205
00:47:42,819 --> 00:47:45,220
photographs that deeply influenced

1206
00:47:45,220 --> 00:47:47,980
humanity's consciousness for the first

1207
00:47:47,980 --> 00:47:50,140
time there was a cultural artifact that

1208
00:47:50,140 --> 00:47:51,940
allowed us to see at first glance our

1209
00:47:51,940 --> 00:47:55,089
place as part of a natural system we

1210
00:47:55,089 --> 00:47:56,339
were no longer the pinnacle of creation

1211
00:47:56,339 --> 00:47:58,299
standing above and separate from the

1212
00:47:58,299 --> 00:48:02,440
rest of nature now we're hardly even

1213
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:05,019
visible from space we were nature we

1214
00:48:05,019 --> 00:48:08,579
were planet inseparably intertwined

1215
00:48:08,579 --> 00:48:10,480
photographs helped coalesce an

1216
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:12,640
environmental philosophy the green

1217
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:14,190
movement ecological consciousness

1218
00:48:14,190 --> 00:48:16,450
sustainability they helped us understand

1219
00:48:16,450 --> 00:48:18,309
ourselves as part of the whole system in

1220
00:48:18,309 --> 00:48:22,720
an easily graspable way today we're

1221
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:24,700
similarly it similarly entwined with our

1222
00:48:24,700 --> 00:48:26,410
networks and the web as we are with

1223
00:48:26,410 --> 00:48:28,150
nature clearly they're not as a crucial

1224
00:48:28,150 --> 00:48:30,789
as the plants the provider oxygen but

1225
00:48:30,789 --> 00:48:32,140
the networks are becoming increasingly

1226
00:48:32,140 --> 00:48:34,750
prevalent spanning the globe bringing

1227
00:48:34,750 --> 00:48:37,150
formally dumb objects to life augmenting

1228
00:48:37,150 --> 00:48:39,369
our individual bodies and our collective

1229
00:48:39,369 --> 00:48:41,680
increasingly cybernetic humanity they've

1230
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:43,839
become a nervous system or externalized

1231
00:48:43,839 --> 00:48:47,079
memory and it will only ever grow denser

1232
00:48:47,079 --> 00:48:49,200
connecting more people and more things

1233
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:52,299
the network is the ultimate human tool

1234
00:48:52,299 --> 00:48:54,759
and it will in time become utterly

1235
00:48:54,759 --> 00:48:57,670
inseparable from us we'll take it with

1236
00:48:57,670 --> 00:48:59,049
us when we eventually leave other

1237
00:48:59,049 --> 00:49:01,269
planets and when it will outlast many of

1238
00:49:01,269 --> 00:49:03,009
the company's countries religions and

1239
00:49:03,009 --> 00:49:05,319
philosophies we know today the word the

1240
00:49:05,319 --> 00:49:08,410
network is never going away again it

1241
00:49:08,410 --> 00:49:09,759
will be with us in some form or other

1242
00:49:09,759 --> 00:49:12,069
until the very end they will receive

1243
00:49:12,069 --> 00:49:14,589
from view as a technical entity but it

1244
00:49:14,589 --> 00:49:16,299
will remain there as the invisible

1245
00:49:16,299 --> 00:49:19,710
backbone of human society in culture

1246
00:49:19,710 --> 00:49:22,720
what I wish for in a way is a cultural

1247
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:24,700
artifact that will easily convey this

1248
00:49:24,700 --> 00:49:27,220
notion today that will capture the

1249
00:49:27,220 --> 00:49:29,019
beauty and the staggering opportunity of

1250
00:49:29,019 --> 00:49:30,880
this human creation that will make

1251
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:32,890
abundantly clear just how intertwined

1252
00:49:32,890 --> 00:49:34,869
our fates are it's make clear that it's

1253
00:49:34,869 --> 00:49:37,180
worth preserving and improving and

1254
00:49:37,180 --> 00:49:39,309
cherishing it's one of the few truly

1255
00:49:39,309 --> 00:49:41,289
global species and compressing

1256
00:49:41,289 --> 00:49:42,819
accomplishments that has a power to do

1257
00:49:42,819 --> 00:49:45,279
so much for so many even if they never

1258
00:49:45,279 --> 00:49:46,690
have the power to contribute to it

1259
00:49:46,690 --> 00:49:47,860
directly

1260
00:49:47,860 --> 00:49:50,150
but to get there we must not only build

1261
00:49:50,150 --> 00:49:51,800
great tools we must build a great

1262
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:54,260
culture we will have achieved nothing if

1263
00:49:54,260 --> 00:49:57,350
our tools are free open secure private

1264
00:49:57,350 --> 00:49:59,480
and decentralized if there is no culture

1265
00:49:59,480 --> 00:50:04,580
to embrace and support these values so I

1266
00:50:04,580 --> 00:50:07,940
implore you make good decisions now step

1267
00:50:07,940 --> 00:50:10,100
off the settling machine thank you very
