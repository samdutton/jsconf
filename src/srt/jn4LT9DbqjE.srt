1
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,150

well first of all thanks a lot for

2
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:38,070
having me here today it's a great honor

3
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:39,150
to speak here it's such a great

4
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:41,640
conference the talks the venue the

5
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:44,420
weather it's really really amazing so

6
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:48,440
who yesterday went on to a bull ride

7
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:51,540
perfect I think next year at the j scope

8
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:53,370
we should all try to you know bike on

9
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:56,370
such a bike to take to the next to the

10
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:58,769
next level we can see all that works I

11
00:00:58,769 --> 00:01:00,540
don't know I would want to be that guy

12
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:04,619
up there but you never know so today I'm

13
00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:08,340
going to talk about bike share and in

14
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:10,320
December we started video series i don't

15
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,060
know if you've seen it and we named it

16
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:14,580
the bike shed initiative my name is

17
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:16,490
Nicola aankhen non-code on twitter i

18
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:20,670
work at yoox ebu we used to do mobile

19
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:22,320
consultancy for a while and then last

20
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,170
year in October we decided to stop them

21
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:28,619
to entirely an only work on bike shed so

22
00:01:28,619 --> 00:01:30,240
I'm going to talk and then show you a

23
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,970
little bit what bike shed is all about

24
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:34,560
so this is one of the logos we did for

25
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,170
the videos and before I show you real

26
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:39,000
demos in examples of what you can do

27
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,619
with bike I want to just go back a

28
00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:43,439
little bit in in time and and explain

29
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:46,200
how we got where we are today so who

30
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,240
remembers the top I Toby Taylor to be a

31
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,610
Snider in 2010 here at the JS conf what

32
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:55,470
Gordon yeah I mean there was back then I

33
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:57,869
was completely blown away by the fact

34
00:01:57,869 --> 00:01:59,400
that this is something you could do with

35
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,720
the JavaScript you know you could

36
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:03,750
interpret a swift file in real time in

37
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:05,729
the browser execute basically flash

38
00:02:05,729 --> 00:02:08,040
content in the browser and this really

39
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,869
was kind of a step forward and to me to

40
00:02:09,869 --> 00:02:11,370
see you know you can't really do stuff

41
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:13,110
which you wouldn't expect to be to be

42
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:15,269
able to do in the browser so last year

43
00:02:15,269 --> 00:02:17,880
in 2011 in January we started continuing

44
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:20,370
working on Gordon with four people in

45
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:21,840
the company and brought it to the level

46
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,730
of support for flash 8 and extra script

47
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:27,150
too and then last year at the jas conf

48
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:30,690
in Berlin we all went to the conference

49
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:33,840
and rented an apartment and after the

50
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:34,890
conference we were sitting down and

51
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:36,780
thinking okay you know how can we take

52
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:39,030
Gordon and the flesh runtime running in

53
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:40,260
the browser doing everything in real

54
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:42,750
time to the next level so we can start

55
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:45,810
reusing content building our own flesh

56
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:47,350
like content building

57
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:49,690
games animations charts whatever you

58
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:52,360
whatever you think of and really really

59
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,920
quickly we came to the conclusion that

60
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,500
we should do this up until then

61
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,360
interpretation of the sweet files in the

62
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,400
browser we should do that on the server

63
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,940
side and convert flesh to JavaScript so

64
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:07,030
we can reuse components you know take

65
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:08,890
little Swift files and build our own

66
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:11,080
games and by that and that's how we got

67
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:13,930
to bike shed the next step was then okay

68
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:16,240
if we convert flesh to JavaScript we

69
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,580
need some type of API and that's going

70
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:20,410
to be inspired by the fish API and buy

71
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:23,020
extra script AP is and this is then

72
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:26,170
bike-share jas so before i get really

73
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:28,510
into bike shed and what you can do with

74
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:30,160
it i'm going to show you a quick video

75
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:32,680
of the video series we did in Christmas

76
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:35,110
for Christmas last year basically on

77
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:36,640
December first we were thinking okay we

78
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,290
need to do something for Christmas and

79
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:40,300
we have 24 days until Christmas so we

80
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:42,370
should do something every day release a

81
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:43,990
little bike shed demo every day and we

82
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:45,940
decided to make a video every day which

83
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:47,380
kind of was crazy because it was much

84
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:49,840
much more work than we ever thought it

85
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,450
would be in the area was really like

86
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:54,970
night shifts of creating videos and at

87
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:56,770
the same time we create created little

88
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:58,840
optical illusions using the first

89
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,720
versions of pike Sergius just as it is a

90
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:04,000
very very very simple use case of what

91
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,890
you could do with bike shed and I'm just

92
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:07,240
going to show you one of the videos we

93
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:11,410
did I hope the audio okay you have audio

94
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:19,650
oh yeah let's just take a look

95
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:28,550
we are crazy JavaScript scientists he

96
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:31,310
traveled to unexplored land to blow your

97
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:38,840
mind with the powers of JavaScript dr.

98
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:47,960
farmer dr. belham on its kind of

99
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:51,740
distorted today we discovered sector 30

100
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:55,759
the shed it's located at the exact

101
00:04:55,759 --> 00:05:04,830
coordinates of we think will be useful

102
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:07,220
thank you that person in the world oh

103
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:12,629
darling so it was one of those videos

104
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:15,319
thanks and I think we should create a

105
00:05:15,319 --> 00:05:17,180
video here from the jas confess well

106
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:21,080
something crazy okay so let's dive into

107
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,909
bikes edges the API a little bit i'm not

108
00:05:22,909 --> 00:05:24,650
going to talk too much about the api

109
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:26,180
because in the end you can you know

110
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:27,740
check out the documentation and just

111
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:30,469
look at the API so I created a little

112
00:05:30,469 --> 00:05:32,530
demo on the flight from amsterdam to

113
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:35,570
here and it's going to be I think it's

114
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:36,800
going to be a bit tricky to read the

115
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,039
read the code but it but it's just an

116
00:05:40,039 --> 00:05:43,880
overview of some of the features you

117
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,949
have in bike shed so of course you can

118
00:05:45,949 --> 00:05:48,710
create shapes many type of shape you can

119
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:53,300
think of paths stars circles squares we

120
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:55,190
have all kinds of helpers for color

121
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:58,069
manipulation lighter darker stuff like

122
00:05:58,069 --> 00:06:02,300
that that's a nice picture a bitmap ap

123
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:05,900
is for sprites I'm animating Chris there

124
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:09,020
in the lower right you see this is our

125
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:11,030
kind of first version of a very simple

126
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:13,969
ide you see the documentation of what

127
00:06:13,969 --> 00:06:15,740
you're doing right now I'm showing up in

128
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:20,750
real time then clipping and masking I'm

129
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:25,280
not using it in this example you should

130
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:28,300
see a little star coming up in a second

131
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:30,500
events multi-touch multi-touch is one

132
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,680
thing which is really really

133
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,060
useful you can get started writing a

134
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:35,699
game for the ipad right away and you've

135
00:06:35,699 --> 00:06:41,280
event handlers filters sepia blur you

136
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,380
know you name it all types of different

137
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:47,870
filters it's the star there already

138
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:52,050
that's coming whooping of items no can

139
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:53,880
have different shapes group them animate

140
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:56,430
these shapes and these groups nest

141
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:59,160
groups if you're familiar with the flesh

142
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,050
API then you probably will recognize

143
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:03,360
whole bunch of stuff shape morphing so

144
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,979
you can take one shape morph it into

145
00:07:04,979 --> 00:07:10,770
another shape I'm drawing a little text

146
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:14,250
bubble with movies and sub movies so you

147
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:16,500
can have I'm going to show later the

148
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,180
windmills away where the wings of the

149
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:20,370
wind will is one movie and then you know

150
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:22,199
you add that to another movie and rotate

151
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:31,380
the wings text phone support then we

152
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:35,130
have a timeline its frame based or so

153
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:36,570
you can you can access certain frames

154
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:38,430
and do certain things at certain frames

155
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:40,470
video support audio support as far as

156
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:45,409
it's possible on iOS for example and

157
00:07:45,409 --> 00:07:47,280
this is kind of interesting and I'm

158
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,960
going to show you the more about this

159
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,400
later the architecture of bike shed is

160
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,810
you could name it a client-server

161
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:53,310
architecture so we have separated the

162
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:55,110
rendering from the movie execution and

163
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:57,750
that basically means that right now this

164
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:00,690
is using an SPG renderer the next thing

165
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:01,919
we're going to be working on is a canvas

166
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:03,449
vendor and hopefully in the future also

167
00:08:03,449 --> 00:08:05,820
the WebGL vendor which is going to be

168
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:07,289
interesting so that's the rendering part

169
00:08:07,289 --> 00:08:10,050
and then the movie execution runs either

170
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:12,090
you know in your brows in your window

171
00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:15,320
threat or in an iframe or in a worker

172
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:18,479
them or you could also run it on node so

173
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:20,400
you can run the movie the bike shed

174
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,470
movie on node is going to stream or the

175
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:31,470
rendering data to the client

176
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:42,220
so Chris is swearing to JavaScript

177
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:46,250
as we have a really simple animation so

178
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:49,970
i want to show you four things today in

179
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:51,680
this talk and the first one is going to

180
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,830
be building a very simple nice turn

181
00:08:54,830 --> 00:08:58,150
based game in bike shed and this is a

182
00:08:58,150 --> 00:09:01,700
little story next to this the guy who

183
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:03,800
made the designs for this game he's

184
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,690
working noise from from Turkey and I

185
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:07,400
found him through dribble Elementary's

186
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,260
know if you know this side for designers

187
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:11,330
and we've built it's got this game

188
00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:13,490
entirely using google translate he

189
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:15,440
doesn't speak English so he was pacing

190
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,030
his Turkish into google translate and

191
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:19,460
sending it through skype to me and there

192
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:21,920
was a lot of lot of great great laughs

193
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:25,880
for me at least in the end worked out so

194
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:28,490
i'm going to show you this game called

195
00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:31,100
nine men's morris basically yeah it's a

196
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:33,200
turn based game you set stones and

197
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,180
whenever you have three stones in a row

198
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:37,610
horizontally or vertically you take the

199
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:39,290
stone from your opponent and whenever

200
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:41,450
one of the players has two stones left

201
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:48,860
that player lost so i have it running

202
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:55,370
here now on the ipad so you can drag

203
00:09:55,370 --> 00:10:01,170
stones

204
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:04,630
that's pretty pretty simple now i have

205
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:12,610
three stones row i can steal one and so

206
00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:15,420
on and so further so if we look at the

207
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:23,890
at the source hold on how how do i do it

208
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:30,960
in sublime that doesn't okay okay cool

209
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:42,850
perfect so here you see more okay that's

210
00:10:42,850 --> 00:11:01,780
really slow haha its do it right let's

211
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:05,920
go back a little bit alright and so

212
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,440
basically you see here i'm including the

213
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:10,930
bike shed runtime you could you could

214
00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:12,550
call it or the bike environment and

215
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:14,620
in this case it's the worker environment

216
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:17,230
and then i'm i'm just having the bike

217
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:18,610
shed player i'm telling the bike shop

218
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:21,010
player to you know run this game pass in

219
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:22,420
the frame rate the height and width and

220
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:25,120
then basically it's running and I see

221
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:28,570
here you know the game running now let's

222
00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:30,610
see and get this running on node so I

223
00:11:30,610 --> 00:11:34,240
built this simple node server and all I

224
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,590
need to do now is I changed the

225
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:38,560
environment too socket i/o in this case

226
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:42,690
and I need to do a little bit of setup

227
00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:46,210
and so here I you know provided the the

228
00:11:46,210 --> 00:11:49,930
address of the node server and now if I

229
00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:53,200
launch the game restart I have it here

230
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:58,180
running on node and now I have it while

231
00:11:58,180 --> 00:11:59,860
you you'll see how I do the moves moving

232
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:02,050
here I have it running on on the iPad

233
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:13,440
and now if I start doing this

234
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:16,880
and basically I didn't have to do

235
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:19,060
anything but just change the environment

236
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:21,200
there's one thing to it right now the

237
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,529
the protocol between the movie execution

238
00:12:24,529 --> 00:12:26,329
in the render is not optimized so

239
00:12:26,329 --> 00:12:27,800
there's some day there's a lot of

240
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:30,230
optimization we can do there switching

241
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:31,880
to a binary protocol or something if you

242
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:34,660
look at the rendering messages right now

243
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:37,660
there's quite some stuff being sent down

244
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:40,310
the wire right now but the idea really

245
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:41,779
is you know that that through the

246
00:12:41,779 --> 00:12:43,370
separation it's much easier for you to

247
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:46,310
build games you know this is not at

248
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:47,540
least at this point is not going to work

249
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:50,510
for a real-time multiplayer shooter game

250
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:52,040
or something but for a game like this

251
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:54,170
it's really a perfect use case

252
00:12:54,170 --> 00:12:56,630
turn-based kind of games and you can

253
00:12:56,630 --> 00:13:00,230
build something like that really fast if

254
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:02,140
there's time at the end we can maybe try

255
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:03,980
everybody who has an ipad to just

256
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:05,089
connect to the server I never tried that

257
00:13:05,089 --> 00:13:07,579
and maybe it's going to maybe it's going

258
00:13:07,579 --> 00:13:13,430
to work so the next thing I want to want

259
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:15,500
to show you is how we can use existing

260
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:18,110
flash content and we use that in our own

261
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:20,329
you know game or our own bike shed

262
00:13:20,329 --> 00:13:23,209
project so before I show you that I want

263
00:13:23,209 --> 00:13:25,550
to have one short Paul who is used to

264
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:29,810
flash ID before ever that's quite some

265
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:33,589
people how many try to use it and failed

266
00:13:33,589 --> 00:13:35,180
with the first tutorial of making a bird

267
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:39,620
fly well I did for me you know at least

268
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:40,910
in the beginning the whole concept of

269
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:42,649
the timeline and how it worked wasn't

270
00:13:42,649 --> 00:13:44,000
very intuitive and it was kind of

271
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,130
complicated so you know I like to be

272
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:48,050
able to just take a flash acid convert

273
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:49,370
it to JavaScript and then use it in

274
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:51,890
JavaScript so what is it here is

275
00:13:51,890 --> 00:13:54,410
basically and I was I was looking for

276
00:13:54,410 --> 00:13:56,839
game as its online and I found this this

277
00:13:56,839 --> 00:14:02,660
Swift file here was with it with a

278
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:04,670
couple of you know beautiful game as its

279
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:07,550
trees houses hearts and stuff like that

280
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:10,220
and I wants to convert that to two bike

281
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:14,060
shed so what I'm going to show you now

282
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:19,970
is our project called missionary its

283
00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:21,329
mission is to convert

284
00:14:21,329 --> 00:14:22,709
every existing flash content to

285
00:14:22,709 --> 00:14:27,600
JavaScript so I took this the house here

286
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:34,799
and converted it to JavaScript oh and

287
00:14:34,799 --> 00:14:42,019
created a little project so here you see

288
00:14:42,019 --> 00:14:44,939
I'm just creating a windmill and I'm

289
00:14:44,939 --> 00:14:46,739
look I'm loading a sub movie so what I

290
00:14:46,739 --> 00:14:49,019
just did I had the house so that's going

291
00:14:49,019 --> 00:14:50,549
to be a sub movie i'm going to replace

292
00:14:50,549 --> 00:14:54,649
the content go back to missionary

293
00:14:54,649 --> 00:15:01,160
convert the wings get the sauce pope

294
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:06,569
paste that into the wings Jas and here

295
00:15:06,569 --> 00:15:09,029
you see stage load sub movie and the

296
00:15:09,029 --> 00:15:11,009
wings and now if I look at the example

297
00:15:11,009 --> 00:15:15,899
in the browser I all of a sudden have

298
00:15:15,899 --> 00:15:18,540
these windmills running in JavaScript

299
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:20,040
and I can just reuse that they could

300
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,809
continue now writing a game just using

301
00:15:21,809 --> 00:15:23,610
these assets so I have you know I've

302
00:15:23,610 --> 00:15:25,529
taken the Swift file converted and now

303
00:15:25,529 --> 00:15:27,269
i'm building a little game so i'm just

304
00:15:27,269 --> 00:15:34,169
going to do one little thing just crazy

305
00:15:34,169 --> 00:15:47,229
touch em windmills see what happens

306
00:15:47,239 --> 00:15:57,780
let's do that all the time

307
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,880
so here we have our flash content

308
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:02,200
converted to JavaScript and now you can

309
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,870
do all kinds of stuff with this and it's

310
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:06,520
really easy to reuse these types of

311
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:14,800
content they don't really do that in the

312
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,700
netherlands two windmills by the way

313
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:20,380
alright so that's the second thing I

314
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:23,850
wanted to show you the third thing is

315
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:26,290
kind of related to the water was just

316
00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:28,630
showing you before now it's how can I

317
00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:30,670
take existing flash content and just

318
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:32,800
change it you know so i'm going to show

319
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,860
you an example of a of some some

320
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:38,620
advertisement I found online and you see

321
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:41,740
it's all in German so let's make it much

322
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:46,600
cooler convert it to JavaScript just so

323
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,160
you see it again here this is the flash

324
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:51,190
version and here i have the bike shed

325
00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:54,630
version so I've the source copy it I

326
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:58,830
have it already in here so there we have

327
00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:02,980
this means sales info I guess so we can

328
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:12,460
just look it up so you see it looks kind

329
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:16,060
of weird so I have two glyph positioning

330
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:17,140
here I'm just going to take that out and

331
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:21,430
the font family as well now it's a

332
00:17:21,430 --> 00:17:28,480
little bit too big so maybe 3942 yeah

333
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,700
that looks good let's change the new to

334
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:37,639
know new to old

335
00:17:37,649 --> 00:17:39,940
yeah I could not remove the glyph

336
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:41,169
positioning I'm just going to leave that

337
00:17:41,169 --> 00:17:48,870
in at t-55 to es5 looks kind of weird

338
00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:58,779
let's animate this coffee machine so I

339
00:17:58,779 --> 00:18:06,629
have that here so we gotta one second

340
00:18:06,629 --> 00:18:11,759
scale it up a little bit so maybe 1.5

341
00:18:11,759 --> 00:18:15,249
now you should see it scale up yeah

342
00:18:15,249 --> 00:18:18,279
little bit let's rotate again just

343
00:18:18,279 --> 00:18:28,360
because rotation is fun oh I fell 10

344
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:33,759
more minutes left it's rotating and

345
00:18:33,759 --> 00:18:44,499
let's do that all the time again this is

346
00:18:44,499 --> 00:18:50,870
so much cooler than a was the boy okay

347
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,830
and so as the last one let's change the

348
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:58,210
text on their up so forth no let's look

349
00:18:58,210 --> 00:19:08,500
for the four start it now change your

350
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:16,659
font size again yeah starting now so

351
00:19:16,659 --> 00:19:18,130
this is an example how you can know

352
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:20,279
create like convert your Flash content

353
00:19:20,279 --> 00:19:24,299
and we use it and create much nicer

354
00:19:24,299 --> 00:19:26,080
animations than they used to be before

355
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:31,029
obviously one thing to note so we're

356
00:19:31,029 --> 00:19:35,149
converting / 9 and 10 and actionscript 3

357
00:19:35,159 --> 00:19:37,450
so right now you don't actually see any

358
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:39,820
action script this is just a few Liam

359
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:42,909
Swift acts we translate it into bike

360
00:19:42,909 --> 00:19:45,820
shed but there's also actionscript three

361
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:52,480
possibilities and now that brings us to

362
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,860
the to the last thing I'm going to talk

363
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:57,850
about today and that's tools so we kind

364
00:19:57,850 --> 00:19:59,140
of thinking thinking about you know how

365
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:00,279
can we create better tools to create

366
00:20:00,279 --> 00:20:03,520
this type of content and like me

367
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,690
personally I'm running around with this

368
00:20:04,690 --> 00:20:06,460
huge laptop right now and it's way too

369
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:08,860
big and I really would like to just be

370
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:11,740
able to work with an ipad I think and if

371
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:13,120
you imagine you have an iPad and you

372
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,190
have an IDE running on your iPad with a

373
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:17,289
keyboard and you create this type of

374
00:20:17,289 --> 00:20:18,940
content you probably want to run it in

375
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:21,490
full screen you know if you preview your

376
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:24,460
animation or your game so the next kind

377
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:27,580
of thing thing to think about is I think

378
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:29,080
how can you use for example your mobile

379
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:31,330
device to then control that ide and

380
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:33,940
change for example bouncing behavior on

381
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:36,100
often animation just draw something on

382
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:38,169
your you know on your iPhone and it's

383
00:20:38,169 --> 00:20:39,610
going to be reflected in real time in

384
00:20:39,610 --> 00:20:41,799
the in the editor on the iPad or the

385
00:20:41,799 --> 00:20:44,830
running animation so we have a very very

386
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:47,260
basic of version of an often I wouldn't

387
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:50,710
even call it an ID it's one editor the

388
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:52,029
nice thing is you see you know what

389
00:20:52,029 --> 00:20:55,750
you're working on on the fly and i was

390
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:58,870
looking at this or a/c protocol who has

391
00:20:58,870 --> 00:21:03,070
heard of OC so it's basically the the

392
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:04,480
next generation of midi

393
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:07,480
it's really used for controlling audio

394
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:09,700
software so we used to have all these

395
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:11,260
you know hardware controllers and

396
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:13,630
communicating with with software for

397
00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:16,929
example using MIDI and now we have over

398
00:21:16,929 --> 00:21:18,370
C and there's this really really nice

399
00:21:18,370 --> 00:21:20,320
app called touch or see for the ipad and

400
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,570
for the iphone and I was just you know

401
00:21:22,570 --> 00:21:24,580
playing around and trying to figure out

402
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:26,679
maybe we can use something like that to

403
00:21:26,679 --> 00:21:30,700
control values of your IDE so I'm just

404
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:34,530
going to show that to you um it's very

405
00:21:34,530 --> 00:21:39,850
very simple example I think I should

406
00:21:39,850 --> 00:21:43,299
make sure the power is OOP just going to

407
00:21:43,299 --> 00:21:55,510
plug in the power see okay um so I I'm

408
00:21:55,510 --> 00:21:58,950
running this ocf here on the iphone and

409
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:02,169
you know this EF like these pads here

410
00:22:02,169 --> 00:22:03,940
and faders and this is really made much

411
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:05,919
more for audio software so it doesn't

412
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:07,450
entirely make sense in the context i'm

413
00:22:07,450 --> 00:22:09,370
going to be showing you here but i think

414
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:10,690
it might be just an inspiration of

415
00:22:10,690 --> 00:22:12,040
thinking you know how can you build

416
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,600
tools to create content like this and

417
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,520
and how can you use for example your

418
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,380
iphone to then you know imagine i will

419
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:19,059
be running this animation and i just

420
00:22:19,059 --> 00:22:21,190
want to change it it's the easiest to

421
00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:25,299
just do it using the iphone so i'm just

422
00:22:25,299 --> 00:22:30,970
going on two values here and now you

423
00:22:30,970 --> 00:22:39,640
know it's just changing it

424
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:41,390
and really this would be changing in

425
00:22:41,390 --> 00:22:43,250
real time as well it's just really the

426
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:45,530
first iteration of this but I can now

427
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:47,390
use my iPhone and control my editor and

428
00:22:47,390 --> 00:22:49,190
you know maybe if you start thinking

429
00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:50,600
about this you can come up with a whole

430
00:22:50,600 --> 00:23:01,930
bunch of interesting scenarios so

431
00:23:01,930 --> 00:23:04,040
Michael Jace is going to be open sourced

432
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:06,590
we unfortunately not release ready it's

433
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:09,280
going to take four more weeks roughly

434
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:11,750
and then we also will launch a public

435
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:13,670
conversion service where you can convert

436
00:23:13,670 --> 00:23:15,400
your flash files and then we use them

437
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:18,070
it's going to be licensed under the MIT

438
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:20,360
yeah and i welcome you to check it out

439
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:23,000
and you can follow by CJ s44 release

440
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,550
info when it's going to be out there and

441
00:23:25,550 --> 00:23:29,230
that's pretty much it for me today

442
00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:32,330
another nice picture if the if the

443
00:23:32,330 --> 00:23:34,520
previous bike wasn't was too much maybe

444
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:36,770
this one is a little bit easier maybe
