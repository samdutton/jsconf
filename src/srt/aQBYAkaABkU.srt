[Music]

2
00:00:20,869 --> 00:00:24,630
are you excited over to CSS yes oh my

3
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:26,550
god yes I'm so happy I'm so happy

4
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:28,859
because I'm going to tell talk a lot

5
00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:31,410
about CSS so I'm gonna blow hot I'm

6
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:34,160
super super excited to be in Singapore

7
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:38,760
and my talk is titled artistic CSS and I

8
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:41,370
hope that you're going to join my CSS

9
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:43,860
journey in which I'm going to tell you

10
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:47,160
how CSS and art intermingle with each

11
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:50,070
other how art movements and design

12
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:53,460
movements actually inspire me to dig

13
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:56,699
deeper in CSS I hope that you'll find it

14
00:00:56,699 --> 00:00:58,739
creative I hope that you will find your

15
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:01,170
inner artist I hope that you will be

16
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:04,470
eager more to experiment and I'm going

17
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:06,689
to share some facts about history of art

18
00:01:06,689 --> 00:01:08,850
so I also hope that it's going to be

19
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:11,090
useful interesting in your daily work

20
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:13,280
you can find me on Instagram and Twitter

21
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,049
and I'm really eager to get some

22
00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:18,030
recommendations what to do in Singapore

23
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:25,500
also in terms of art and design yes

24
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:28,049
but before I actually start I would like

25
00:01:28,049 --> 00:01:34,079
to ask all of you to close your eyes all

26
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:36,420
of you I can see some eyes open okay so

27
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:38,909
close your eyes try to be relaxed don't

28
00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:42,299
fall asleep so try to remind the moment

29
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:44,790
when you were recently inspired by the

30
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:49,200
art or design think where was it in the

31
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,229
art gallery the art museum or maybe on

32
00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:56,450
the street was it painting

33
00:01:56,450 --> 00:02:01,190
the sculpture maybe the performance what

34
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:03,050
was very specific

35
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:06,800
was it the color the shape the

36
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:11,300
composition or the overall style what

37
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:13,190
did you actually do about it

38
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:16,700
did you apply it somewhere did you tell

39
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:22,160
about it to your friends okay so you can

40
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:26,930
open your eyes and I have to confess dad

41
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:30,110
art and the real word is something that

42
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:32,420
I'm super inspired by although I'm web

43
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:34,489
designer and coder and I spent a lot of

44
00:02:34,489 --> 00:02:36,110
time in front of computer screen

45
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:38,780
actually the real word the analog part

46
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:42,410
bring brings a lot of ideas to me and I

47
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:45,650
always try to keep myself awake and keep

48
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:47,959
my eyes wide open whenever I travel

49
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:50,300
whenever I visit museums or art

50
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:53,330
galleries and I'm also addicted to it I

51
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:55,700
traveled a lot this year and I visited

52
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:58,880
tons of museums and cool exhibitions and

53
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,890
what I found is that there is a

54
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:04,160
connection between Web Design CSS and

55
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:07,430
art and this was actually the stimulus

56
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:11,720
that pushed me forward to create this

57
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:15,380
dog another one was the tweet by

58
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:17,780
Christopher fond son in which is writing

59
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:20,660
which more people knew what CSS is

60
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:23,000
capable of there are so many

61
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,180
possibilities now for more creative fun

62
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:30,079
and unique layouts but I just don't see

63
00:03:30,079 --> 00:03:32,900
them happening that often and it's true

64
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:34,850
because we're still strapping 12

65
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:38,329
Congress and three boxes we always see

66
00:03:38,329 --> 00:03:41,209
the website like as a box a thing so I

67
00:03:41,209 --> 00:03:43,280
hope that my talk about artistic and

68
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,829
design movements will give you an

69
00:03:45,829 --> 00:03:49,730
incentive to explore and experiment with

70
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:53,720
CSS because it's a very creative tool so

71
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:56,180
the first design movement I'm going to

72
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:59,420
mention well actually you're going to

73
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:02,359
guess which which one is that my hand is

74
00:04:02,359 --> 00:04:06,319
that it's celebrating 100th anniversary

75
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:08,480
dessert and what I would like to do

76
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:08,900
right now

77
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:10,970
is to open Twitter if your user account

78
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:13,610
Twitter account if not you can pair up

79
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:16,269
with someone who has a Twitter account

80
00:04:16,269 --> 00:04:18,049
and I'm quitting

81
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:19,489
I've been uploading as my Twitter handle

82
00:04:19,489 --> 00:04:22,160
and when the law I'm twittering a poll

83
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,729
on Twitter right now I hope that you're

84
00:04:25,729 --> 00:04:29,300
going to see it second and I'm going to

85
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:33,320
give you ten seconds to vote so there

86
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:36,350
are three design art movements mentioned

87
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:40,370
so which that celebrate 100th

88
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:43,190
anniversary this year is it daddies is

89
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:45,940
it Bauhaus or is it impressionist

90
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:51,139
so I'm waiting for your votes refreshing

91
00:04:51,139 --> 00:04:52,190
Twitter nervously

92
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:57,650
I can't see anything but just giving ten

93
00:04:57,650 --> 00:05:02,660
seconds more maybe I'll switch to my

94
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:09,860
mobile beta let's see whether your heart

95
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:21,010
experts are not

96
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:25,580
don't see any votes can you see the

97
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:28,240
tweet with the poll yes

98
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:35,900
have you already voted okay so and did

99
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:39,229
you see the result you can see okay so

100
00:05:39,229 --> 00:05:43,099
oh okay I can see it right now so

101
00:05:43,099 --> 00:05:44,979
there's a half half for it that has

102
00:05:44,979 --> 00:05:50,440
Impressionists so the proper answer is

103
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:55,250
happy birthday bad house so impress.js

104
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:57,979
was in as a bit before because it was

105
00:05:57,979 --> 00:06:01,190
19th century and bad house was created

106
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:05,810
in 1919 so it's like the true 100

107
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:09,020
anniversary so bad house is a this I was

108
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:11,870
Design School it was operating between

109
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:16,490
1919 and 1933 in Germany it was created

110
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:18,470
by Walter Gropius in Vemma and in

111
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:32,159
Germany and it was something totally new

112
00:06:32,169 --> 00:06:37,039
hello okay thank you so that has was

113
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:38,570
something totally different

114
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:41,740
it was a definite of a new art school so

115
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:46,610
in bath house they wanted to unify our

116
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:49,789
architecture and crafts together they

117
00:06:49,789 --> 00:06:52,400
also embraced technology so they weren't

118
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,400
afraid of experiments they also

119
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,469
encouraged students to dig more into

120
00:06:57,469 --> 00:07:03,289
typography theory of colors and

121
00:07:03,289 --> 00:07:07,960
performance so they really were into

122
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:11,150
simplicity minimalism and pure geometric

123
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:14,479
forms as you can see this is the example

124
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:16,219
that the works that were created in

125
00:07:16,219 --> 00:07:20,300
around 1920s and you can see that there

126
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:23,300
is still very modern and designers from

127
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:27,169
21st century could created it so what

128
00:07:27,169 --> 00:07:29,120
was also very special about a bath house

129
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:33,050
is that they wanted to have mass

130
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:33,680
production

131
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,300
in its course so they think very

132
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:40,030
practically in all works of life and all

133
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:43,660
disciplines of art and design and also

134
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:46,250
practical minds of Bauhaus they were

135
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:51,590
focused on minimalism and pure form in

136
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:55,070
terms of like visual stuff so they

137
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:57,710
worked on a grid a lot and this is

138
00:07:57,710 --> 00:08:00,470
something that we also have in CSS and

139
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:02,330
this is the connection between power

140
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:07,940
house very practical and an CSS so we

141
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:10,400
all know that CSS is shipped to browsers

142
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,220
we know that we can experiment a lot but

143
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:14,810
I'm sure there are some people who

144
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:17,530
haven't already dig deeper into it and

145
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:20,360
in terms of the browser support it's

146
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,490
getting a lot of better you can see the

147
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:24,910
green light so it's a good sign for us

148
00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:27,110
at the same time you might think that

149
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:29,870
grid also it's kind of a limitation and

150
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:34,459
it also pushes forward pushed us

151
00:08:34,459 --> 00:08:51,350
actually toward more back Celia I don't

152
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:56,080
think okay I'll try to not to laugh and

153
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:00,709
so so what is very important in terms of

154
00:09:00,709 --> 00:09:04,490
grid is actually it yeah of course it

155
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:07,850
has some constraints some limitation but

156
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:10,130
actually breaking the grid breaking the

157
00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:12,920
rules is super interesting from the user

158
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:15,589
perspective because when you when you

159
00:09:15,589 --> 00:09:19,180
see the Luft Hansa like Swiss like

160
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:22,580
poster you will see that a letter L is

161
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:24,290
of the grid and it's something that

162
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:26,860
attracts user attention

163
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:30,620
so we can also trade the grid just like

164
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:35,390
the way of experiments and also a way of

165
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:37,580
putting elements in in different places

166
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:42,500
not very usual and what I love about CSS

167
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:45,010
grid and Firefox developer tools is that

168
00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:46,819
it actually

169
00:09:46,819 --> 00:09:48,709
read the gap between designers and

170
00:09:48,709 --> 00:09:51,019
developers and this is very bad house

171
00:09:51,019 --> 00:09:53,660
like idea because Bauhaus wanted to

172
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:56,149
bring engineers designers technologists

173
00:09:56,149 --> 00:09:59,209
together and also deaf I think that deaf

174
00:09:59,209 --> 00:10:01,759
tools is a perfect example of doing it

175
00:10:01,759 --> 00:10:06,019
because you've got a great panel for for

176
00:10:06,019 --> 00:10:09,859
CSS grid which you can immediately dive

177
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:13,579
into it so if you work closely designers

178
00:10:13,579 --> 00:10:16,309
I strongly recommend you to show it to

179
00:10:16,309 --> 00:10:20,839
to your fellow friends and also new

180
00:10:20,839 --> 00:10:23,600
thing is happening so subgrid was was

181
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,699
already mention a test configured this

182
00:10:25,699 --> 00:10:28,369
year in Berlin by Ranger Rachel Andrew

183
00:10:28,369 --> 00:10:31,669
and with SAP grid you can create even

184
00:10:31,669 --> 00:10:34,189
more complex and complicated layouts

185
00:10:34,189 --> 00:10:38,809
because you can nest grid inside and you

186
00:10:38,809 --> 00:10:40,879
can also use the tracks definition of

187
00:10:40,879 --> 00:10:44,839
the parent in terms of support well it's

188
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:47,539
not that good yet but I took this

189
00:10:47,539 --> 00:10:49,399
screenshot a couple of years a couple of

190
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:53,169
days ago and I also opened Twitter after

191
00:10:53,169 --> 00:10:56,629
after a while and I stumble upon this

192
00:10:56,629 --> 00:10:59,239
tweet by John Simmons that sub bread is

193
00:10:59,239 --> 00:11:09,259
actually coming to Firefox so it's so so

194
00:11:09,259 --> 00:11:11,059
you can experiment in Firefox nightly

195
00:11:11,059 --> 00:11:13,369
because currently it's it's in a working

196
00:11:13,369 --> 00:11:17,029
draft and when mentioning about the grid

197
00:11:17,029 --> 00:11:21,919
I also want to tell about dish towl so

198
00:11:21,919 --> 00:11:24,559
this is the movement which was created

199
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:26,509
actually one year before bath house in

200
00:11:26,509 --> 00:11:29,989
the Netherlands what do we have people

201
00:11:29,989 --> 00:11:33,709
from the Netherlands hello

202
00:11:33,709 --> 00:11:40,459
III by the way yeah so their style is

203
00:11:40,459 --> 00:11:43,220
for me it's super inspiring in terms of

204
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:46,399
forum colors like biography and the most

205
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:48,889
famous representative of the stylist

206
00:11:48,889 --> 00:11:51,879
Mondrian and I hope that you you've seen

207
00:11:51,879 --> 00:11:55,639
his work somewhere it's super grid

208
00:11:55,639 --> 00:11:57,649
oriented and some people might think

209
00:11:57,649 --> 00:11:59,850
that well is it an art but for me

210
00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:02,850
it's so fascinating there there are

211
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:07,050
primary colors in like pure form which

212
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:09,540
is for me super super a big inspiration

213
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:12,269
for building the layouts and this is

214
00:12:12,269 --> 00:12:15,899
what also Jen Simmons does with with

215
00:12:15,899 --> 00:12:18,209
experiment layout lab this is her

216
00:12:18,209 --> 00:12:20,220
website and I strongly recommend you to

217
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:23,310
dude visited and to dig deeper and I

218
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:25,980
love that she rotated the whole grid and

219
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:30,600
it's such a playful thing so as you can

220
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:34,649
see it's open grid another website that

221
00:12:34,649 --> 00:12:37,980
our stumble upon is the deck so this is

222
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:39,389
this website actually won the

223
00:12:39,389 --> 00:12:42,149
competition on Smashing mag for the most

224
00:12:42,149 --> 00:12:46,380
creative usage of grid not only it's a

225
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:50,009
perfect example of creativity with grid

226
00:12:50,009 --> 00:12:53,490
but also I love the pure form the color

227
00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:55,740
that shapes enter a very Mondrian like

228
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:58,920
and taking a lot of inspiration from the

229
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:02,310
staff so summing up the first design

230
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:05,939
movement which was badass in digital we

231
00:13:05,939 --> 00:13:08,610
have CSS grid and sub grid and please

232
00:13:08,610 --> 00:13:11,399
use it use it in a creative manner use

233
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:14,189
it with crazy ideas I hope that that you

234
00:13:14,189 --> 00:13:17,670
will enjoy it so coming up to the second

235
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:20,699
one I would like to mention about

236
00:13:20,699 --> 00:13:24,209
post-modernism and collage so the term

237
00:13:24,209 --> 00:13:27,420
collage was actually mentioned in the

238
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:29,420
beginning of 20th century

239
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:33,930
by Georges Braque and Pablo Picasso I I

240
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:35,880
guess that you know the second one for

241
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:36,899
sure

242
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:38,970
so collage is all about mixing different

243
00:13:38,970 --> 00:13:42,209
media and you must say that it looks

244
00:13:42,209 --> 00:13:46,350
very creative and I think that working

245
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:50,370
with paper and scissors brings a lot of

246
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:54,360
ideas and that only is very relaxing but

247
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:57,110
also abroad in your artistic horizons

248
00:13:57,110 --> 00:14:02,850
and and bring a lot of ideas so I'm a

249
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:05,850
super inspired by one Polish girl one

250
00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:06,870
polish designer

251
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:09,990
her name is Baracus and she does a lot

252
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:13,340
of work with paper and digital art or

253
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:16,730
with collage she she she's been working

254
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:19,490
with many widely known brands like

255
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:23,210
Spotify also fashion brands and when I

256
00:14:23,210 --> 00:14:25,790
see her work I immediately think how I

257
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:27,529
can reuse some of the concept and

258
00:14:27,529 --> 00:14:30,830
transfer it to to the World Wide Web so

259
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:35,000
I started seeing CSS just like ik

260
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Caesars and and and I think that's super

261
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,970
creative tool so I'm such a huge fan of

262
00:14:40,970 --> 00:14:42,560
barcodes that I also attended her

263
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:46,480
workshops where we were supposed to

264
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:50,589
create collages for for Coco Chanel and

265
00:14:50,589 --> 00:14:55,370
it was tons of fun you have to try one

266
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:57,610
day to do the collage only with paper

267
00:14:57,610 --> 00:15:00,050
because it's something it's just like

268
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:02,600
with sketching before you actually sit -

269
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:06,950
the graphics editor you can just take

270
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:11,270
all your creative ideas and just present

271
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:13,640
it on a paper it's it's much more easier

272
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:17,150
rather than collecting and and pushing

273
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:21,170
pixels so this is one of my work I

274
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:24,500
started to experiment with CSS what you

275
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:26,000
can see here if there are some images

276
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,230
but I used CSS to actually cut it out

277
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:32,690
and you can see some see-through you can

278
00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:34,820
see some flowers coming up from from the

279
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:37,940
jacket you can see some glitter and also

280
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:42,140
glitter under women's eyes so I used CSS

281
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:48,200
masking so masking helps us to reveal or

282
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:51,230
excite some some elements in CSS it also

283
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:54,170
defines the transparency levels so we

284
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:58,430
have we can we can influence luhan's on

285
00:15:58,430 --> 00:16:02,810
on the Alpha Channel so the mask image

286
00:16:02,810 --> 00:16:05,410
is combined with the image source and

287
00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:09,890
and it's counted like the the levels of

288
00:16:09,890 --> 00:16:13,959
transparency so here in this example

289
00:16:13,959 --> 00:16:18,830
there's a we've got a simple image and

290
00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:20,420
we have the

291
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:23,990
apply so it just cats out the part of

292
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:26,089
the jacket and underneath I applied a

293
00:16:26,089 --> 00:16:30,709
gift file as simple as that for the

294
00:16:30,709 --> 00:16:35,079
glitter splash I also use masking and

295
00:16:35,079 --> 00:16:38,200
here's the example so I've just had the

296
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:41,450
simple container with the background

297
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:44,180
which is this gift and I apply masking

298
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:48,410
and some sorts of collars addition using

299
00:16:48,410 --> 00:16:52,250
blend modes if you would like to have

300
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:54,529
the different transparency levels you

301
00:16:54,529 --> 00:16:57,769
can do it with masking and here's the

302
00:16:57,769 --> 00:16:58,970
example of masculist

303
00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:02,600
it's like fading out to the corner and

304
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:06,500
you can also see that the splash the

305
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:11,660
glitter is fading out so you just simply

306
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:14,360
apply it with with one line of code but

307
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:16,339
you need to remember about the vendor

308
00:17:16,339 --> 00:17:18,970
prefixes as well

309
00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:21,860
we have also CSS clipping which is to me

310
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:25,280
just like scissors and paper and it's

311
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,740
kind of similar to masking but for a

312
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:31,130
masking we can use images and for a CSS

313
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:35,299
we can all only use vector vector images

314
00:17:35,299 --> 00:17:38,270
so paths paints basically so in clipping

315
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:40,460
we decides whether something is visible

316
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:42,590
or not we don't have the option for

317
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:45,500
transparency levels and this is the

318
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:48,770
example kind of my digital collage I

319
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:51,260
made with CSS so you've got the plan

320
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:55,760
that is cut it out with clipping so what

321
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:58,940
I did before is I had to prepare the the

322
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:01,040
path the shape of the of the path of the

323
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:03,710
plan I did an illustrator exported an

324
00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:06,049
SVG and later applied it and clip path

325
00:18:06,049 --> 00:18:11,200
so I to the SVG code face it and an HTML

326
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:14,090
between death stacks so it means that it

327
00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:16,640
won't be generated anywhere but at like

328
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:19,880
the our website knows what is the

329
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:22,520
definition for the path and later we

330
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:24,559
just reference to it in CSS

331
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:29,610
so we've got clip path property

332
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:32,400
and this is how it looks in real life

333
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,710
we've got the plans I also applied some

334
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:39,370
background and some blend modes and if I

335
00:18:39,370 --> 00:18:41,860
comment out the flip pass you'll see the

336
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:48,909
whole image so simple as that and if

337
00:18:48,909 --> 00:18:51,400
you're not very convinced that actually

338
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,799
CSS masking and clipping are the future

339
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:55,990
of web design I would like to show you

340
00:18:55,990 --> 00:18:58,120
New York Times website this is one of

341
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:03,039
the article although they didn't use CSS

342
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:05,260
clipping or masking fur for cutting out

343
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:07,690
those shapes I think that more collage

344
00:19:07,690 --> 00:19:09,640
like websites will be coming soon

345
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:12,250
because I think it's it's at the prime

346
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:15,070
tire right now so we're talking about

347
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:18,159
masking I would also like to put an

348
00:19:18,159 --> 00:19:21,520
accent on storytelling so we all want to

349
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:24,190
have our users attracted to our website

350
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:27,100
and the content and some shapes some

351
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:30,370
visual elements actually help us to draw

352
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:33,610
the attention of the users and I was

353
00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:35,679
super inspired by one of the example by

354
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:37,600
Razvan elements so I decided to do my

355
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,720
create my own version so you can imagine

356
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,220
that you're reading national geography

357
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:46,270
or some blog post about that travel to

358
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:51,490
to Iceland so what is done here is that

359
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:54,490
we've got the heading that has the width

360
00:19:54,490 --> 00:19:58,929
and the height fixed so we can apply the

361
00:19:58,929 --> 00:20:02,649
background and we can apply the mask so

362
00:20:02,649 --> 00:20:06,760
the mask helps us to cover the heading

363
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:09,370
and we have the impression that it's

364
00:20:09,370 --> 00:20:13,029
actually emerging behind the mountains

365
00:20:13,029 --> 00:20:16,149
so we also have the text fixed and in

366
00:20:16,149 --> 00:20:19,720
span tag and and it's just simple as

367
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:22,919
that and we also need to apply mask size

368
00:20:22,919 --> 00:20:26,080
to to make it match to that to the

369
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:29,980
background we have for the heading and I

370
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:31,659
really like this example because it's

371
00:20:31,659 --> 00:20:34,090
very approachable for designers but also

372
00:20:34,090 --> 00:20:37,750
gives us like it's very impactful in

373
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:40,120
terms of user experience and the overall

374
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:41,440
impression of the

375
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,960
website of the article so what I

376
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:46,360
predicted needed to prepare before is

377
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:50,500
the mask image so I I cutted it out and

378
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:54,070
in Photoshop and after applying a mask

379
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:57,610
we have the visible area so the area

380
00:20:57,610 --> 00:21:00,639
where where the text will be visible so

381
00:21:00,639 --> 00:21:02,919
if we have the background it's going to

382
00:21:02,919 --> 00:21:06,370
be transparent and the text is what

383
00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:09,309
would be will be emerging from from this

384
00:21:09,309 --> 00:21:12,669
space and when talking about masking I'm

385
00:21:12,669 --> 00:21:15,159
super excited about math composite so

386
00:21:15,159 --> 00:21:18,850
mask composite lets us to combine to

387
00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:23,049
compose many layers of mask of masks

388
00:21:23,049 --> 00:21:26,409
image images so let's imagine we've got

389
00:21:26,409 --> 00:21:31,450
two masks splashes and one gradient so

390
00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:34,990
what we do is we apply two masks and

391
00:21:34,990 --> 00:21:38,200
then we just need to define the

392
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:40,840
compositing mode so here it is mask

393
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:44,289
composite add and what's it's good to

394
00:21:44,289 --> 00:21:46,269
remember is that the first one is called

395
00:21:46,269 --> 00:21:48,399
the source and the second is the

396
00:21:48,399 --> 00:21:50,710
destination and once they're combined

397
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:53,440
later than can be applied for the image

398
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,710
that we're masking we're going to mask

399
00:21:55,710 --> 00:21:58,990
so this is the example I created and I

400
00:21:58,990 --> 00:22:01,240
was inspired by some fashion magazines

401
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:03,789
and I really wanted to keep this like

402
00:22:03,789 --> 00:22:06,610
very artistic vibe so we have the image

403
00:22:06,610 --> 00:22:09,610
and here you can see it's actually

404
00:22:09,610 --> 00:22:12,700
animated you can see different different

405
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:21,000
compositing modes and in this example

406
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,909
you're seeing that we're having two two

407
00:22:24,909 --> 00:22:28,179
masks and if we apply only one it looks

408
00:22:28,179 --> 00:22:30,909
like this but if we combine them and

409
00:22:30,909 --> 00:22:32,830
actually add another image to make it

410
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:36,039
more collage like we can see that it

411
00:22:36,039 --> 00:22:38,019
gives us a really interesting in fact

412
00:22:38,019 --> 00:22:40,840
very artistic so for this one we've got

413
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:43,360
intersect compositing mode we can use

414
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:49,149
add and we can use the friend we've got

415
00:22:49,149 --> 00:22:49,750
four of them

416
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:51,730
and I'm going to show you in a minute

417
00:22:51,730 --> 00:22:55,010
and for this I also used blend modes to

418
00:22:55,010 --> 00:22:59,630
make it like more more natural effects

419
00:22:59,630 --> 00:23:03,290
of the flowers and make it more blended

420
00:23:03,290 --> 00:23:05,120
with the first image that it's

421
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:07,970
underneath so something that we've got

422
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:11,090
for blending for compositing modes

423
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:14,660
we've got add subtract intersect and

424
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:17,090
exclude operators and in terms of

425
00:23:17,090 --> 00:23:19,970
browser compatibility well it's not that

426
00:23:19,970 --> 00:23:21,980
best yet but it doesn't mean that we

427
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:24,410
can't experiment with it in general

428
00:23:24,410 --> 00:23:29,660
masking is is better so I think that

429
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:31,610
this is the moment to start digging into

430
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:36,050
now summing up the collage movement it

431
00:23:36,050 --> 00:23:37,730
was originated by Pablo Picasso and

432
00:23:37,730 --> 00:23:42,530
Georges Braque in France and CSS is

433
00:23:42,530 --> 00:23:45,680
deriving a lot from it through masking

434
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:48,890
and clipping so the next movement its

435
00:23:48,890 --> 00:23:51,530
pop art and I and I and I hope that

436
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:53,600
you're familiar with some works of Andy

437
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,720
Warhol and what I like about his worse

438
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:59,300
is the color so when I think about color

439
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:02,720
and CSS one thing comes to my mind and

440
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:06,140
these are blend modes so I'm talking

441
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:07,820
about and thinking about blend modes

442
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:10,460
there is do a ton of fact a widely

443
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:14,870
popular widely used by by Spotify and I

444
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:16,940
was wondering okay can we do something

445
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:18,980
like this with CSS and of course we do

446
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:21,560
so this is the simple image without any

447
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:24,680
changes and these are some experiments

448
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:28,370
with with blend modes so we've got the

449
00:24:28,370 --> 00:24:31,130
container and inside there is an image

450
00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:34,160
but there are also pseudo elements

451
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:36,320
before and after created for the image

452
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,540
container where we have different

453
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:41,000
background values red and pink and

454
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,900
different mix blend modes we've got 16

455
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:47,900
of them so you can you can experiment a

456
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:50,240
lot as you can see we can have very

457
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:54,920
various effects and again it's pretty

458
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,600
simple to apply and I'm pretty creative

459
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:59,390
to have on the website so summing up

460
00:24:59,390 --> 00:25:03,110
we've got pop art and we have blend

461
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:06,330
modes in CSS

462
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:09,220
last art movement I want to mention is

463
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:11,950
one of my beloved it's anti design it

464
00:25:11,950 --> 00:25:14,770
actually was taken from architecture in

465
00:25:14,770 --> 00:25:18,059
brittle and Brutalism in architecture so

466
00:25:18,059 --> 00:25:22,570
for instance Bloomberg applies a lot of

467
00:25:22,570 --> 00:25:24,970
anti design ideas so you can see that

468
00:25:24,970 --> 00:25:27,610
some some some of their their ideas are

469
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:30,250
kind of pretty kind of likely so this is

470
00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:33,429
all about anti design where we where all

471
00:25:33,429 --> 00:25:37,600
the errors and jamming is welcome so

472
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:40,179
this actually became a very hot design

473
00:25:40,179 --> 00:25:43,149
trend this year and laughter as well and

474
00:25:43,149 --> 00:25:45,850
in terms of representatives and art for

475
00:25:45,850 --> 00:25:48,039
for anti design there is fluxes group

476
00:25:48,039 --> 00:25:52,330
for instance Yoko Ono belong to it so it

477
00:25:52,330 --> 00:25:53,950
was originated in 60s

478
00:25:53,950 --> 00:25:58,059
and what they wanted to do is like the

479
00:25:58,059 --> 00:26:01,059
freedom in art so they blend it a lot of

480
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:03,970
different genres and they were trying to

481
00:26:03,970 --> 00:26:06,760
make some ideas from typography from

482
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:09,520
performance to yard so they were

483
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:12,220
experimenting a lot and I also really

484
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:14,289
liked the typography experiments that

485
00:26:14,289 --> 00:26:17,799
are presented here so what's happening

486
00:26:17,799 --> 00:26:19,690
on the web are the brittle ice website

487
00:26:19,690 --> 00:26:22,990
that I truly love because like they're

488
00:26:22,990 --> 00:26:26,020
not afraid of experiments they're kind

489
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:28,059
of weapon on come for mists and if I

490
00:26:28,059 --> 00:26:30,549
look for the inspiration even if I work

491
00:26:30,549 --> 00:26:33,490
for serious clients I always I always

492
00:26:33,490 --> 00:26:36,190
visit Brit Silas website have you ever

493
00:26:36,190 --> 00:26:39,970
heard about them by the way okay so

494
00:26:39,970 --> 00:26:42,309
people so if you if you haven't visited

495
00:26:42,309 --> 00:26:44,049
this website I strongly recommend you

496
00:26:44,049 --> 00:26:46,299
it's British websites I've come and it

497
00:26:46,299 --> 00:26:48,850
and it's now states that British website

498
00:26:48,850 --> 00:26:51,880
our dad but if you use inspect also you

499
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:55,750
can easily explore the website so when

500
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:58,840
looking for some ideas from anti design

501
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:01,779
and like having something it's different

502
00:27:01,779 --> 00:27:05,350
and more and being more Rebell on the

503
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:09,100
web i i i found this website and i love

504
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:11,710
it because it's it's very simple but

505
00:27:11,710 --> 00:27:15,760
they used one effect with playing with

506
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:19,000
with perspectives and skewing and i love

507
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:19,750
the fact that

508
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:21,970
the website is dedicated to architects

509
00:27:21,970 --> 00:27:25,030
actually so so playing with perspectives

510
00:27:25,030 --> 00:27:29,230
it's very wise and I was wondering okay

511
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:31,360
so how can we apply it on the web is it

512
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:34,630
difficult and it was super easy to find

513
00:27:34,630 --> 00:27:37,539
this code pen by James Boswell but first

514
00:27:37,539 --> 00:27:40,049
and you can find the address out there

515
00:27:40,049 --> 00:27:43,360
so it's just the wave with CSS

516
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:47,140
transforms we're skewing and with some

517
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:50,020
upsetting a front from the left side and

518
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:52,330
scaling the text and it's done on hover

519
00:27:52,330 --> 00:27:57,309
so it's super super cool and I also was

520
00:27:57,309 --> 00:28:00,059
exploring other website and found this

521
00:28:00,059 --> 00:28:05,190
with a kind of playful typography and

522
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:07,900
think that immediately came to my mind

523
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:10,049
with variable fonts and I hope that

524
00:28:10,049 --> 00:28:12,700
you're saying for Mandy's dogs because

525
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:14,559
she's going to show you some awesome

526
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:17,679
experiments with variable fonts although

527
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:19,419
that this is an image I think that we

528
00:28:19,419 --> 00:28:22,539
can finally do some crazy stuff with CSS

529
00:28:22,539 --> 00:28:25,600
to have playful typography and a bit

530
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:28,480
different than usual and also playing

531
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,340
with the perspective and I think it's

532
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:31,870
it's something that it's not

533
00:28:31,870 --> 00:28:34,750
very frequently used but I think that we

534
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:38,039
should start triangle 3d with some

535
00:28:38,039 --> 00:28:41,289
skewing in CSS because it gives a

536
00:28:41,289 --> 00:28:44,950
totally different different impression

537
00:28:44,950 --> 00:28:48,580
on the web summing up the design trend

538
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:51,220
we have brittle ISM in architecture

539
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:54,309
we've got flexes group and everything

540
00:28:54,309 --> 00:28:56,500
what's happening in in Britain in

541
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:59,530
British web sizes is super attractive so

542
00:28:59,530 --> 00:29:02,679
please don't forget about transforming

543
00:29:02,679 --> 00:29:06,789
CSS and variable fonts well if you're

544
00:29:06,789 --> 00:29:09,880
afraid of experiments and you think that

545
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:13,210
some it's not that easy to take a risk

546
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:16,690
and apply all those all these CSS

547
00:29:16,690 --> 00:29:20,230
properties which are not fully yeah I I

548
00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:22,690
just recommend you to use supports rule

549
00:29:22,690 --> 00:29:25,809
which works like just like media query

550
00:29:25,809 --> 00:29:28,030
so if the browser doesn't support a

551
00:29:28,030 --> 00:29:30,760
block of code of lack of CSS it will

552
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:31,760
just skip it

553
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:36,860
so we use it in this manner and if you

554
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:41,690
don't visit museums often or or or don't

555
00:29:41,690 --> 00:29:43,940
want to look for inspiration in in the

556
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:47,390
analog world I if I could recommend

557
00:29:47,390 --> 00:29:51,020
something I would recommend interest so

558
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:53,240
I have my own board which is called CSS

559
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:56,590
inspirations and I usually take some

560
00:29:56,590 --> 00:29:58,970
some things from the print and the

561
00:29:58,970 --> 00:30:02,090
tutorial because I think that print

562
00:30:02,090 --> 00:30:05,360
gives us a lot of ideas what we can do

563
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:11,240
with CSS so summing up we have CSS graph

564
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:13,730
I mentioned about clipping and masking

565
00:30:13,730 --> 00:30:16,550
which for me art dislike scissors and

566
00:30:16,550 --> 00:30:21,050
CSS we have variable fonts

567
00:30:21,050 --> 00:30:24,100
we've got blend modes I didn't mention

568
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:26,600
writing modes but this is also super

569
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:29,540
cool super creative to have different

570
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:33,560
ways of showing and aligning the text so

571
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:36,290
I hope that you'll feel inspired

572
00:30:36,290 --> 00:30:39,500
you'll feel inspired and you're eager to

573
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:43,010
start digging into CSS and before I

574
00:30:43,010 --> 00:30:44,840
finish my talk I actually would like to

00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:47,750
