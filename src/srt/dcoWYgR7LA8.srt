00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:25,710
talk if you're if you're feeling sad

4
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:28,320
that my voice is broken you have a

5
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,470
gentleman to thank that for so I do not

6
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:39,270
regret that but hi and welcome to the

7
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:46,260
talk a mojo I am planning to work I work

8
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:48,870
on nodejs and a lot of stuff as I told

9
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:52,110
you but talking about

10
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:53,850
internationalisation today I'm sorry I

11
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:58,710
just early I was not in the right kind

12
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:02,309
of food but so because I have to make

13
00:01:02,309 --> 00:01:06,200
this about myself first I work on nodejs

14
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:10,380
also electron well and I contributed

15
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:11,909
different projects in the JavaScript

16
00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:15,630
ecosystem now that includes v8 and test

17
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:19,950
- six - that's how I'm barely qualified

18
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:21,470
enough to talk about this subject

19
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:24,930
because I worked on some of the stuff

20
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:30,000
that relates to this right and also the

21
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,150
beauty and related things in the

22
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:35,340
ecosystem I'm a student as they pointed

23
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:38,070
out I been working with Google Summer of

24
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:41,189
Code for the past couple years and I'm a

25
00:01:41,189 --> 00:01:42,750
speaker this this is not for you this is

26
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:45,450
for me to reassure myself all the time

27
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:50,810
times like you got this but so yeah I

28
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:54,570
about the talk actually so we need to

29
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:59,549
talk so we know how this works right a

30
00:01:59,549 --> 00:02:03,689
couple of months ago I made a proposal

31
00:02:03,689 --> 00:02:07,110
for something that I want to work on so

32
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:08,729
a lot of months ago I was working on

33
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:10,950
these things that was like oh it'd be so

34
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:13,530
amazing to talk to people about

35
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:17,910
and I I mean a CFP proposal for this and

36
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:22,080
I saw working on the talk and I realized

37
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,660
that I'll be talking at the awesome at

38
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:26,910
desk on fascia - oh you're some people

39
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:30,180
about this subject and a super stoked

40
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:32,850
one of my friends in Russia set up a

41
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:35,940
meetup group like - for me to test this

42
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:39,350
talk out I went to the meetup group

43
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:42,000
amazing young talented software

44
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,959
engineers sitting down listen to this

45
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:48,330
guy about internationalization and I

46
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:50,880
completely tanked the presentation like

47
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:54,110
it's it was so terrible that I like I

48
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:56,550
get chills till it's I'm getting

49
00:02:56,550 --> 00:03:00,660
flashbacks so I thought maybe I could

50
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:03,300
like of course you're not as critical or

51
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:05,850
savage as the like Russians there was

52
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:09,180
like oh no but I thought I had the

53
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:11,489
courage to come up to this stage and

54
00:03:11,489 --> 00:03:14,160
talk to you guys about that presentation

55
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:19,200
I I think I do not so let's skip it it's

56
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,280
it's super boring anyway

57
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:26,970
so yeah a lot of stuff I had when but oh

58
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:29,790
yeah atmosphere proposals right who

59
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:31,370
cares

60
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:37,110
so yeah you ever done I skip the like

61
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:39,030
entire presentation like three minutes

62
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:43,920
so yeah don't want to bother you

63
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,410
actually now that we have a bunch of

64
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:49,290
time and I'm a speaker and I oh yeah

65
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:51,720
I've got you ears let's talk about

66
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:52,530
something else

67
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:56,310
something that we all care about if

68
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:58,920
anybody is like even borderline sad that

69
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:02,989
that I you did not get to hear about

70
00:04:02,989 --> 00:04:05,459
what you came here for let me tell you

71
00:04:05,459 --> 00:04:07,680
about a cool website that I found on the

72
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,959
internet it's super amazing you

73
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:12,269
convinced so the deal how this works is

74
00:04:12,269 --> 00:04:13,860
you can just go to the website and

75
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:17,040
you'll get my entire talk it's called

76
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:21,720
MDN so yeah that that was that was the

77
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:24,000
original top you you so if you scan this

78
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,280
QR code you go directly to the

79
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:26,970
internationalize

80
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:31,350
same page I'm sorry I cannot like come

81
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:33,060
up here and talk to you people about

82
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:35,070
like the nitty-gritties of the API

83
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:39,390
you'll just hate me for that so yeah go

84
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:41,940
there and this will drop you directly to

85
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:46,200
the intel page let's talk about

86
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,790
something else let's forget about the

87
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:50,190
talk it was boring and pretty much

88
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:52,290
useless let's talk about software

89
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:56,070
development right it's I hope everybody

90
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:59,040
is okay with that and let's talk about

91
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,540
software development because software is

92
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:03,870
hard right I mean so so let's get this

93
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:08,160
straight like you all spent like at

94
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,230
least three important days of your life

95
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:13,740
and and pretty much like most probably a

96
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:17,160
lot of money thousand dollars ticket

97
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:20,640
Jess conf right and like travel all that

98
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:24,060
stuff to listen to a bunch of nerds

99
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:27,540
talking about nerdy stuff like why would

100
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:29,490
he do that right you could spend that

101
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:31,800
time doing nice things you did that

102
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,690
because software is hard it's really

103
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:36,150
hard to do software and you want to like

104
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:38,700
do it better do it more efficiently you

105
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:42,930
know what else is hard currencies so so

106
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:46,440
I mean one of the things that I do is I

107
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:50,130
ask engineers to - when when you go back

108
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:52,410
to your company find the guy who works

109
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:55,260
with find the guy or the person working

110
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:59,280
on currencies and and payments and hug

111
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,820
them like really they're miserable

112
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:06,060
because currencies are hard and if you

113
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:10,590
think currencies are hard like me it the

114
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:12,479
the reason for that might not be that

115
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,610
you're as bad of a developer as I am

116
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:17,010
because currencies are hard for everyone

117
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:19,950
like the people who you look up to like

118
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:22,350
all the damn time screw up with

119
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:25,110
currencies all the damn time so there'd

120
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:27,330
be Google it's like so United States

121
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:29,550
always some arbitrary Omar years with my

122
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:33,300
three euros or it's it sucks when you

123
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:35,640
create your undefined civic type-r it's

124
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:38,010
like how do I pay you like not a number

125
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:39,700
dollars right

126
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:42,700
or when you get a leap late fee because

127
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:44,530
you do not know how to pay like to your

128
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:49,090
dollars Bethesda say a that that's an

129
00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:50,620
awesome thing you should definitely pay

130
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:55,810
that much for that modify like you you

131
00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:58,180
don't expect more if I do this like do I

132
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:00,130
paint pants do I pay in dollars do I

133
00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:03,250
paint neither of those and and also like

134
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:06,100
obviously the almighty euro dollar

135
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:08,560
so it's hero is dollar it's your another

136
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,480
hero the next time

137
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:14,650
I think the hell right and and you know

138
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:16,960
you know this this is the right if you

139
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,970
if you work on product stuff if you work

140
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:21,880
on design this is these are the pretty

141
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:24,250
cool like microseconds right these are

142
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:25,870
the critical microseconds we have

143
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:28,120
already converted a user that they're

144
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:30,700
waiting to make that payment and the

145
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:33,160
users basically like shut up and take my

146
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:36,070
money like just this is the body we very

147
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:38,880
do not screw up right everything else

148
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:42,310
you got a free pass but like do not show

149
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:45,250
our payments because like you finally

150
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:48,340
convinced them to pave that's amazing

151
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:51,520
right some people kind of get it though

152
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:54,810
I mean like I like a lot of things about

153
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:57,310
some of the Google web sites for example

154
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:59,110
when I was giving this talk in Russia

155
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:04,090
like I already thanked the top talk and

156
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:09,700
they were deporting me they detected

157
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:11,950
that that I was in Russia and that I'd

158
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:15,400
probably use roubles to go and so they

159
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,650
deported me to the next slide mister

160
00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:20,410
Latvia so I ended up being in Latvia and

161
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:23,470
I to go back home somehow so and then

162
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:26,860
they detected I had to use euros and

163
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:31,360
then coming here from home I on are you

164
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,400
go there you can go there right now it

165
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,290
probably detect you're in Singapore and

166
00:08:35,290 --> 00:08:37,090
just like show you all the things in s

167
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:38,920
unique and that's great user experience

168
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:43,080
right so so how's this sound like like

169
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:48,370
get me through this it's easy so it no

170
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:51,040
hard rules really straightforward so in

171
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,990
in the english-speaking world it's

172
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:53,950
fairly easy right

173
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:56,950
so we use this is as God intended it to

174
00:08:56,950 --> 00:08:59,620
me we have the decimal point when it

175
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:01,720
needs to be we have the comma separator

176
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:05,230
x' dollars pounds and euros of your

177
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:10,690
Island but but it thinks as soon as you

178
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:11,920
move out of the english-speaking world

179
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:15,550
things start to get complicated so you

180
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:19,570
can have like yeah yeah Europe I get

181
00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:25,029
that like but why like I like that that

182
00:09:25,029 --> 00:09:26,980
defies mathematics that's not like a

183
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:29,709
valid number that's why would you do

184
00:09:29,709 --> 00:09:31,810
that it was like Europeans like oh it's

185
00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:34,180
okay but like so many people live in

186
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:36,250
Europe and and like have some context

187
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:38,079
about this it's like it's fair to assume

188
00:09:38,079 --> 00:09:39,790
like eighty percent of the people in the

189
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:41,320
world like probably have some idea about

190
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:43,500
this format so it's like it's still bad

191
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:47,709
if we look at this one and Latvians so

192
00:09:47,709 --> 00:09:49,779
so that means used to use a space for

193
00:09:49,779 --> 00:09:52,570
like the delimitation i'm like what it's

194
00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:54,160
like that's not what do you use spaces

195
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:57,040
for but okay at least they're not using

196
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:02,140
stabs so and then it's like is that a

197
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:05,470
fraction like it's not what I do I do I

198
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:07,620
have to do math every time I'm like I

199
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:11,560
and of course the Japanese drop the drop

200
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:14,760
the fraction because there's no fraction

201
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:18,220
but like so so an Indonesian people like

202
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:19,570
you know Indonesian people in the

203
00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:22,870
audience could like right we need to

204
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:27,910
talk so what the hell is this what the

205
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:30,970
hell is this because that that is

206
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:34,420
totally one point two three five I'm

207
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:36,610
gonna come up to you and I gotta pay you

208
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:39,399
one point two three five not and I think

209
00:10:39,399 --> 00:10:43,000
it's not silly if you're reaching levels

210
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,810
of like confusing Ness but it's like I'm

211
00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:49,569
not even joking anymore right so the

212
00:10:49,569 --> 00:10:52,779
swiss franc using an apostrophe it's

213
00:10:52,779 --> 00:10:54,699
it's not a valid number but it's about

214
00:10:54,699 --> 00:10:59,319
its trained eyes and so this is

215
00:10:59,319 --> 00:11:02,410
interesting if you're Canadian you

216
00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:04,529
should like reconsider life choices

217
00:11:04,529 --> 00:11:06,600
because so big

218
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,550
not you when I say if you're in

219
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:11,910
Canada if the person like the format in

220
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:13,589
which you write the currency depends on

221
00:11:13,589 --> 00:11:15,329
which language the person is speaking in

222
00:11:15,329 --> 00:11:17,910
so you write that if they're speaking

223
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:20,430
English you write this if they're

224
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:23,310
speaking in French it's like how how do

225
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:25,230
you determine that's like do you wear a

226
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:27,810
tag it's like it says French and then

227
00:11:27,810 --> 00:11:29,370
people like Izumo they're they're

228
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:34,800
probably not as smart but but yeah it

229
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,750
doesn't have to be that way so let's

230
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:39,209
talk about the the most important thing

231
00:11:39,209 --> 00:11:45,000
life let's talk about anxiety is what I

232
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,319
feel when I work in multiple currencies

233
00:11:46,319 --> 00:11:48,600
and it doesn't have to be that way let's

234
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:53,759
fix this so we did if you go to your

235
00:11:53,759 --> 00:11:56,220
browser if you go to your friend

236
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:57,990
friendly browser right now or know Jess

237
00:11:57,990 --> 00:12:02,459
and and try this API so you go currency

238
00:12:02,459 --> 00:12:05,250
you go Canadian dollars boom

239
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:08,670
English you got that French you got that

240
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:10,079
and it's like it that's just one

241
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:12,360
currency in two languages you can you

242
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,250
can try that with all combinations it

243
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:15,029
just works

244
00:12:15,029 --> 00:12:17,939
it takes out like so you can have

245
00:12:17,939 --> 00:12:20,160
variables for the currency and for the

246
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,079
language and then like it you can take

247
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:25,350
the guesswork out of the printing you

248
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:27,569
can just you do not use a static string

249
00:12:27,569 --> 00:12:29,939
just like number format your currencies

250
00:12:29,939 --> 00:12:36,269
and so so I'm sorry right for what I'm

251
00:12:36,269 --> 00:12:39,269
gonna say next but I have bad news it's

252
00:12:39,269 --> 00:12:40,980
like I hate to be the bearer of bad news

253
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:42,870
but it's not just currencies that are

254
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:46,160
hard right internationalization is hard

255
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:53,329
it's really damn hard so so actually oh

256
00:12:53,329 --> 00:12:59,339
this is we we have a small problem so so

257
00:12:59,339 --> 00:13:01,050
I was Brian to talk about a lot of other

258
00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:03,420
things actually with just one next thing

259
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:05,910
but the problem about this is I cannot I

260
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:09,240
think because like a lot of you are not

261
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,339
as smart as me and do not know as much

262
00:13:11,339 --> 00:13:13,740
math so I think we need to like revisit

263
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:15,630
some of the fundamentals if I like want

264
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:17,370
to want you to be at the same level of

265
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:20,520
thinking as me I am of course so

266
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:22,589
let's let's take a couple of minutes to

267
00:13:22,589 --> 00:13:24,510
revisit the fundamentals if that's okay

268
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:27,630
yeah first class of kindergarten

269
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:30,660
counting so so let's let's start

270
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:33,600
counting and we all love cats right so

271
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:37,250
so let's count cats so you're one cat

272
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:40,709
you've six cats and you have zero point

273
00:13:40,709 --> 00:13:42,120
seven cats now don't ask me how that

274
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:44,790
works maybe maybe you have like nine

275
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:46,560
roommates and seven cats between all of

276
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:51,149
you but like yeah so but like if you see

277
00:13:51,149 --> 00:13:53,610
the pattern here English is like two

278
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:55,170
when it comes to claw realization

279
00:13:55,170 --> 00:13:58,020
English as like two things which is one

280
00:13:58,020 --> 00:14:01,110
not one which is like pretty simple it's

281
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:03,060
like it's either one or not one like it

282
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:05,640
might be a fraction it might be like non

283
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:09,860
one number but it's not one and

284
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:13,430
polarization is easy life is good

285
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:17,730
let's actually let's so let's move on to

286
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:20,899
a different breed of cats Welsh cats and

287
00:14:20,899 --> 00:14:23,670
Counting Welsh cats you have zero Kitab

288
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:28,190
you one get the 1.5 cat you have to get

289
00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:32,730
your three got your six yet you're 42

290
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:38,310
cat so pluralization is in English

291
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:42,220
and that's just death that's just the

292
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:44,320
second language that's just velch and

293
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,660
feels like so do SuperDuper close to

294
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:49,000
England right that's like how do you

295
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:49,690
 that up

296
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:54,190
that up
but like you you go to like countries

297
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:54,880
across the world

298
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:58,420
Arabic is like for plural forms and like

299
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:00,759
languages of like plural forms so

300
00:15:00,759 --> 00:15:03,519
English has like one and other and and

301
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:05,440
other languages that few and many and

302
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,639
like how do you determine that looks

303
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:09,310
like it's so hard to figure this stuff

304
00:15:09,310 --> 00:15:15,100
out but it doesn't have to be so we have

305
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:18,100
a plural rules API for stuff like this

306
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:21,130
so you can you can tell it okay English

307
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:26,050
us I like beef jerky but PR just like

308
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:30,759
zero it'll throw up other 0.5 other one

309
00:15:30,759 --> 00:15:33,670
is one and everything else is other you

310
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:36,370
can just use this underlying low level

311
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:39,850
API to determine what plural drew you

312
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:43,870
need to use and you could I'm going to

313
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:45,940
show a bunch of code next please do not

314
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:47,709
bother with like trying to read all of

315
00:15:47,709 --> 00:15:49,899
that it's like just just trying to

316
00:15:49,899 --> 00:15:52,449
demonstrate make a point you'll get the

317
00:15:52,449 --> 00:15:54,910
code later on but you can use this

318
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:58,720
underlying API if you notice to to spin

319
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:01,529
up a quick script to like format your

320
00:16:01,529 --> 00:16:05,529
sentence right so English and just

321
00:16:05,529 --> 00:16:07,810
change it slightly and make it work for

322
00:16:07,810 --> 00:16:10,779
Welch and this is this an amazing API

323
00:16:10,779 --> 00:16:12,630
you can use it for ordinals

324
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:15,399
so you've got 0 at first second third

325
00:16:15,399 --> 00:16:19,120
fourth 11th and 21st forty second

326
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,880
hundred third in any language that you

327
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:24,970
want so these examples that I showed you

328
00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:27,490
I I'm not smart enough to write them but

329
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:30,790
the amazing people at v8 are and they

330
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:32,589
have like a huge blog post op it

331
00:16:32,589 --> 00:16:35,439
explains the all the feature in detail

332
00:16:35,439 --> 00:16:37,810
it's amazing you can also find the code

333
00:16:37,810 --> 00:16:39,850
there just scan the QR code if you want

334
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:45,069
to just follow this link but yeah that's

335
00:16:45,069 --> 00:16:49,240
that's that API so like let's let's talk

336
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,740
about now that you're talking about

337
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:51,730
stuff I have

338
00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:54,639
zoo Asian right everybody loves relative

339
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:57,010
time expressions like you do not want to

340
00:16:57,010 --> 00:17:00,310
know that your driver is for 42 seconds

341
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:03,579
away though but like the other

342
00:17:03,579 --> 00:17:06,370
observation I have is nobody really

343
00:17:06,370 --> 00:17:07,660
knows how to do it

344
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:09,910
and and everybody tries to do it I'm

345
00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:11,829
like I'm just playing a video game it's

346
00:17:11,829 --> 00:17:13,720
like what what is that number

347
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:16,030
do it do I reach one this year I just

348
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:21,490
want to play csgo and why is that so

349
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:24,549
specific it's like what's gonna happens

350
00:17:24,549 --> 00:17:26,230
that is that like the next Eclipse or

351
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:30,580
something but but you don't have to like

352
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:33,549
you don't have to be like super smart to

353
00:17:33,549 --> 00:17:35,620
do it anymore because you also have an

354
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:37,809
API for that so relative time formatting

355
00:17:37,809 --> 00:17:40,179
it's called relative time format numeric

356
00:17:40,179 --> 00:17:42,760
auto is like the format but you want it

357
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:45,570
to be in you can like do it short narrow

358
00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:49,530
whatever and and - one day is yesterday

359
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:52,990
zero day is today one day is tomorrow -

360
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:55,720
one week is last week zero week is this

361
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:57,910
week one week is next week that's so

362
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:03,370
cool right now they you can do this you

363
00:18:03,370 --> 00:18:05,860
could already do this like this is this

364
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:08,590
is not that hard to do you'd be thinking

365
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:11,549
but I'll leave up to your imagination

366
00:18:11,549 --> 00:18:14,140
how hard it is to do in multiple

367
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:16,720
languages if you want to support like 15

368
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,660
languages you're not gonna do it on your

369
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:22,059
own and you'll not been people have been

370
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:25,990
trying to do this kind of stuff relative

371
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:27,850
time formatting especially on the

372
00:18:27,850 --> 00:18:30,070
internet for like all the time and

373
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:32,770
you'll probably do it as well you might

374
00:18:32,770 --> 00:18:34,750
use something like moment or globalize

375
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:38,049
but definites with that now there's a

376
00:18:38,049 --> 00:18:42,309
problem with this and and where my segue

377
00:18:42,309 --> 00:18:46,210
into that is gonna be this right so I'm

378
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:49,330
sorry but Laurie who you might find

379
00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:51,400
Brown is like better react in the

380
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,470
browser you comments and I it's like

381
00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:56,049
it's a joke we get it but then if you

382
00:18:56,049 --> 00:18:58,390
think about it Laurie's on to something

383
00:18:58,390 --> 00:19:01,690
right I mean like how many of you are

384
00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:04,330
friend developers by the way people who

385
00:19:04,330 --> 00:19:05,560
do front-end stuff that's

386
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:07,810
quite a few I cannot say anybody but

387
00:19:07,810 --> 00:19:15,210
that's quite a few people yes and the

388
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:17,920
so bill reactant or browser you comments

389
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:21,130
and so you are making front-end web

390
00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:25,840
sites and the thing is that you like

391
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,880
pretty much every modern front-end web

392
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:31,870
site like uses some sort of decent dome

393
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:34,690
API right you use react or something and

394
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:36,400
it's like why can't you just standardize

395
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,890
that that will shave off your bundle

396
00:19:38,890 --> 00:19:41,230
sizes that would also like make a

397
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:43,360
standard API then people can that people

398
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:46,480
can just build upon and then and people

399
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,370
are doing that people are expanding the

400
00:19:48,370 --> 00:19:52,600
web platform virtual Dom we're coming to

401
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:56,430
the HTML standard so that's cool like

402
00:19:56,430 --> 00:19:59,620
talking about these kind of things let's

403
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:03,280
talk about sizes and like this is

404
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:07,030
completely safe for work but so so react

405
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:09,190
and react I by the way I do not want to

406
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:11,050
be controversial about this please do

407
00:20:11,050 --> 00:20:13,750
not separate me I have no idea what

408
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:15,550
these words even mean like I I just

409
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:17,770
write C++ please leave me alone Twitter

410
00:20:17,770 --> 00:20:22,390
but this is just data but like because

411
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:24,040
people come up to me is like oh yeah

412
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,450
isn't that supposed to be half the size

413
00:20:25,450 --> 00:20:28,320
of Rick I do not know you tell me but

414
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:32,920
but react is is six like it's 187

415
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:39,130
kilobytes if you if you react in itself

416
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:42,010
is a package that has a huge download

417
00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:44,380
it's like around 60 kaveri but then

418
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:45,880
people come up to me it's like it's not

419
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:47,800
what it has to the bundle it's just what

420
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,870
you download it's like fair enough so it

421
00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:51,880
just had six one five kilobytes to the

422
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:54,430
bundle while pre-act adds 900 bytes now

423
00:20:54,430 --> 00:20:56,620
that's basically cheating because if you

424
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:58,750
also add react on that basically adds

425
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:03,220
like 104 kilobytes which is like but but

426
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:05,890
let's not dwell into that again but so

427
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:08,280
comparing the magnitude you add in view

428
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:11,800
and it's like it's sixty three point

429
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:14,340
five kilobytes if you just see the the

430
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:18,250
bundle size and then when you are

431
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:20,289
an angle that does this angle the slash

432
00:21:20,289 --> 00:21:23,110
core so so you need a bunch of other

433
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:24,820
angular modules as well to make angular

434
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:26,980
websites but let's compare that to the

435
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:30,460
seal D our data now we gotta talk about

436
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:35,169
this because so that's over six

437
00:21:35,169 --> 00:21:39,039
megabytes for dates you need numbers to

438
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:40,480
work with dates so that's four point

439
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:43,630
three megabytes another one and but

440
00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:46,960
there's a huge likes earlier or also

441
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:50,380
data that you need and then this like

442
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:52,539
obviously you need something to query

443
00:21:52,539 --> 00:21:54,820
this data with so you need a Jas library

444
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:58,000
for that and other like but these are so

445
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,650
abysmally small compared to these that

446
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:01,240
like let's not even talk about that

447
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:06,070
right but that data is large imagine

448
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:09,429
having this so I tried to like include

449
00:22:09,429 --> 00:22:11,409
the the bundle size which is the same

450
00:22:11,409 --> 00:22:13,090
because like this is JSON

451
00:22:13,090 --> 00:22:15,640
you can't tree shake that right you need

452
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,530
all the data you need like you can't

453
00:22:17,530 --> 00:22:21,850
just drop languages but so so if you

454
00:22:21,850 --> 00:22:24,190
like have to compile all that data and

455
00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:26,559
push that video bundle that's like over

456
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:30,150
it 11 megabytes if you have a manager

457
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:33,429
even somewhat like the managers I've

458
00:22:33,429 --> 00:22:36,730
seen it's a non-starter like 11

459
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:42,520
megabytes in no way but it's the

460
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:44,640
relative time format API you know how

461
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:47,559
much the model size and this one is zero

462
00:22:47,559 --> 00:22:50,080
because it's built in the browser and

463
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:54,340
and you can you go from narrow 3/4 one

464
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:56,590
day and you can go for Spanish which is

465
00:22:56,590 --> 00:23:01,960
so cool a lot vien or yeah this does not

466
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:05,200
make any sense or Chinese and this is so

467
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:08,580
cool right you can just use these two to

468
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:11,919
check out what yesterday and today is I

469
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:14,710
tomorrow is I pretty much wrote a script

470
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:16,840
just to know what these words are in

471
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:19,470
different languages I have nothing to do

472
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:22,780
and so it's like what about comparing

473
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:25,900
strings by the way yay we have got later

474
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:28,600
for that because for some reason the

475
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:31,840
Germans deal with the Avett accents

476
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,359
completely different from the Swedish

477
00:23:34,359 --> 00:23:35,950
it's like did they're right across the

478
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:37,899
border like get this sorted out right

479
00:23:37,899 --> 00:23:40,779
it's like just but yeah you if you want

480
00:23:40,779 --> 00:23:42,549
to compare strings if you want to sort

481
00:23:42,549 --> 00:23:44,440
strings or search strings which you have

482
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:48,700
to do like so so many damn time you can

483
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:49,719
use this for that

484
00:23:49,719 --> 00:23:53,799
it's local specific and people people

485
00:23:53,799 --> 00:23:55,690
come up to me when I talk about this API

486
00:23:55,690 --> 00:23:58,149
and they would be like oh imagine the

487
00:23:58,149 --> 00:24:02,409
possibilities we have so this date time

488
00:24:02,409 --> 00:24:06,219
formatting less formatting like again

489
00:24:06,219 --> 00:24:09,039
these all things were despite whichever

490
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:10,479
language you're working on this

491
00:24:10,479 --> 00:24:12,659
segmenting so you can iterate over

492
00:24:12,659 --> 00:24:15,489
sentences paragraphs whatever you don't

493
00:24:15,489 --> 00:24:19,089
have to like do dot split period because

494
00:24:19,089 --> 00:24:21,940
like that only works so so far right and

495
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:26,830
and it's all a part of to please come

496
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:32,259
help out now I think I can mirror my

497
00:24:32,259 --> 00:24:42,549
display on this one okay if you go can I

498
00:24:42,549 --> 00:24:45,969
use for internationalization it's

499
00:24:45,969 --> 00:24:48,339
putting all over the boat like most of

500
00:24:48,339 --> 00:24:50,320
the internationalization features you

501
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:53,200
can use in your applications right now

502
00:24:53,200 --> 00:25:00,190
if you say the test to six to rip out on

503
00:25:00,190 --> 00:25:04,210
the internationalization API test this

504
00:25:04,210 --> 00:25:06,609
was the day we people put up this

505
00:25:06,609 --> 00:25:09,909
website remove cha-cha Creek or our IP

506
00:25:09,909 --> 00:25:14,139
and if you if you see the

507
00:25:14,139 --> 00:25:17,769
internationalisation API it started off

508
00:25:17,769 --> 00:25:22,330
with around 57% coverage with v8 going

509
00:25:22,330 --> 00:25:27,009
71 yeah in spider monkey 50% JavaScript

510
00:25:27,009 --> 00:25:30,909
poor for the 8% okay and if you see that

511
00:25:30,909 --> 00:25:33,339
the day the numbers have improved right

512
00:25:33,339 --> 00:25:38,289
so as of yesterday actually we didn't

513
00:25:38,289 --> 00:25:40,839
build it today yet and remove a little

514
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:42,839
excess also if we don't care about it

515
00:25:42,839 --> 00:25:45,490
it's 61 percent and

516
00:25:45,490 --> 00:25:47,860
he's hitting 86% and spider monkeys

517
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:51,250
improve to 54 javascriptcore says at 44

518
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:53,710
but like things are improving things are

519
00:25:53,710 --> 00:25:56,200
getting better the deaths like the

520
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:58,090
number of tests increase between that

521
00:25:58,090 --> 00:25:59,950
time so it's like even if somebody

522
00:25:59,950 --> 00:26:01,929
stayed at the same number they added

523
00:26:01,929 --> 00:26:02,950
some features

524
00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:06,190
I'd say v8 is like technically if you

525
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:08,100
look at it we it is pretty much 100%

526
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:11,550
covered a lot of this comes from like

527
00:26:11,550 --> 00:26:14,860
features landing in v8 right now plus

528
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:16,780
like one API which is called v8 brake

529
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:19,150
iterator which we have like they handle

530
00:26:19,150 --> 00:26:21,670
differently it's like yeah if you're

531
00:26:21,670 --> 00:26:23,650
using no GS if you're using if it

532
00:26:23,650 --> 00:26:26,050
refuses use Chrome which I think they do

533
00:26:26,050 --> 00:26:31,059
I mean the numbers a 10 you can or any

534
00:26:31,059 --> 00:26:33,070
chromium based browser for that matter

535
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:35,980
you can be perfectly sure that this will

536
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:39,850
like chess work right so please use

537
00:26:39,850 --> 00:26:41,920
internationalization API Singapore is

538
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:45,820
the only big GS Khan city that I can go

539
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:48,550
to and be like four languages you know

540
00:26:48,550 --> 00:26:51,100
how bad it is right and people like yes

541
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:52,720
