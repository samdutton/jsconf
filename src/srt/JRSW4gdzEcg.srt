00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:05,549

that's fine hey I'm Kristin and I work

2
00:00:05,549 --> 00:00:08,639
at github but this talk isn't like about

3
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:10,860
me as an engineer at get up it's more of

4
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:17,100
a user so before I started working

5
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,140
github I would have all these kinda like

6
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:21,750
ideas about like I wish github could do

7
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:24,390
this one thing and I would write these

8
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:27,269
chrome extensions to kind of help my

9
00:00:27,269 --> 00:00:29,939
workflow to do these things there but

10
00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:34,110
there's like some things that but

11
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:36,000
there's some stuff that I couldn't do as

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,980
Chrome extensions and so for those

13
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:43,920
things I recently discovered this

14
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:49,660
library that is not the right clicker

15
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:53,190
it's called pro bot and it's a library

16
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:55,770
for github to write these github

17
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:59,160
applications and pro bot does this by

18
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:01,590
leveraging web hooks and the k-dub api

19
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:04,799
to give you kind of the power to extend

20
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:07,939
github in a in a pretty simple way and

21
00:01:07,939 --> 00:01:10,080
most instances of pro bots are

22
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,299
responding to events so something

23
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:14,460
happens on github Probot gets a ping

24
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:17,490
through a web hook and it might like

25
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:18,840
analyze like what should I do in this

26
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,850
situation and it will maybe fire off

27
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:23,189
some events of its own and we can

28
00:01:23,189 --> 00:01:24,840
actually take I have a little trivial

29
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,390
example and let's say if we want to

30
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:29,400
respond to every issue that's opened in

31
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:32,159
a repository and like let's just like

32
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:33,360
say hello just give them a little

33
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,750
welcoming message all right we're gonna

34
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:38,460
build it right now so we have this

35
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:40,909
module and it just takes in robot as

36
00:01:40,909 --> 00:01:45,180
argument or a parameter and so we can

37
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:49,049
attach event listeners on the robot and

38
00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:50,360
there's a list on the github

39
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,439
documentation page for the events you

40
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:54,899
can listen for and here we're just like

41
00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:56,549
listening for if there's any issue

42
00:01:56,549 --> 00:01:59,729
that's opened we get this context with

43
00:01:59,729 --> 00:02:03,320
it and so with this context we can

44
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:05,759
create a comment this is kind of

45
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:07,290
confusing I didn't really understand

46
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:08,700
this at first but this is essentially

47
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:11,540
just gives you like an object back that

48
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:13,670
operates in the context of the

49
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:15,800
issue and we just give it the body

50
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:20,209
thanks for the issue and then just using

51
00:02:20,209 --> 00:02:22,040
get up get up API if you ever used it

52
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:24,110
it's pretty it's fairly simple we just

53
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:30,250
say create this comment and that's it

54
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:32,810
it's pretty easy like we can run this

55
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:34,880
and every time somebody opens up an

56
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:37,070
issue on a repository where this Probot

57
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:41,090
isn't against its installed it will

58
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:41,830
respond

59
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:45,950
thanks for the issue I thought this was

60
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:47,630
pretty cool when I saw it first because

61
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:50,690
you can do these crazy things there's a

62
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:52,010
bunch of Pro BOTS out there you might

63
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:53,810
have seen them if you go into these

64
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:57,620
popular get up repositories sometimes

65
00:02:57,620 --> 00:02:59,300
they'll like close down the issues when

66
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:02,000
nobody is commenting on it for some days

67
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,870
and I have a problem that I really

68
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:10,880
wanted to solve with Probot and it is

69
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:13,430
related to es lint I don't know if

70
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:15,680
everybody here uses lint but I almost

71
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,579
always use it in my projects and I have

72
00:03:19,579 --> 00:03:21,079
it running so like it will run in a

73
00:03:21,079 --> 00:03:24,290
built and if if someone broken easily

74
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:26,690
through it will give you like a red

75
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:30,799
status on the floor request there's just

76
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:33,829
one problem with this people can just

77
00:03:33,829 --> 00:03:36,049
like disable the rules right there in

78
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:39,739
the code and so this is a project that I

79
00:03:39,739 --> 00:03:41,660
have where somebody just disabled all

80
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:42,860
the rules and just did whatever they

81
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:46,370
want it which is fine like I understand

82
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:47,840
that sometimes people just like need to

83
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,180
get stuff done and so they like they're

84
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:51,709
like I don't know how to do this I just

85
00:03:51,709 --> 00:03:54,980
I know how to use jQuery show I don't

86
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:57,680
know how to like show and hide things so

87
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,570
I'm like empathetic to it but I I maybe

88
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:02,450
would want it to like focus that you

89
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:04,610
shouldn't do this or like ping me and

90
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:06,320
tell and I can explain them how they can

91
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:10,670
do it correctly so like this previous

92
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:11,780
one it just goes through like

93
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:13,579
everything's green people are like great

94
00:04:13,579 --> 00:04:18,979
Mercer pull requests I like I said I

95
00:04:18,979 --> 00:04:21,580
would like for these to be flagged so I

96
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:25,580
wrote this Probot that I gave it a

97
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:27,470
little logo

98
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:32,150
here's a logo with eyes emoji and so it

99
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:34,460
just watches pull requests and when a

100
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:36,650
poor cousin comes in it checks the diff

101
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:38,630
and if somebody added I isn't disabled

102
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:41,620
it will just comment right on there just

103
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:46,190
please please don't there's a really

104
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:48,289
great thing you can if you install Pro

105
00:04:48,289 --> 00:04:51,289
BOTS into your repositories you can give

106
00:04:51,289 --> 00:04:52,610
him convicts

107
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:55,370
so my Probot you can change this message

108
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:59,539
and like if you wanna if you wanna give

109
00:04:59,539 --> 00:05:03,050
him like a little image you can do that

110
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:04,610
you can like at the team that should

111
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:07,130
review this be like at the j/s team to

112
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:10,310
be like you can you know you don't have

113
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,460
to use jQuery show you can do this thing

114
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:16,400
and yeah if they're like legitimate is

115
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:20,960
lint disables this talk went by really

116
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:24,199
fast you can find Probot on github robot

117
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:28,550
dog awl and my Probot is on my github

118
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:32,380
which is up there thank you
