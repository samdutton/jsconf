00:00:11,719 --> 00:00:15,360

thank you

2
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:18,520
hi um that's my twitter handle if you

3
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:20,170
have any questions right at all go if

4
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:21,670
you want to message me want to complain

5
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:24,070
about the content you can do so on there

6
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:28,210
so I want to start with a story and just

7
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:29,830
for the second imagine this is a

8
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:33,670
classroom in high school I took a class

9
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:36,970
that is really hard to translate it into

10
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:39,730
English but it's something a line of

11
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:43,899
music appreciation or sound listening

12
00:00:43,899 --> 00:00:47,320
and you know not only we listened to a

13
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:49,629
lot of music and learn about classical

14
00:00:49,629 --> 00:00:52,510
music history we also watch a lot of

15
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:56,530
movies we alter the sound wave

16
00:00:56,530 --> 00:00:58,899
artificially to sound the conversation

17
00:00:58,899 --> 00:01:02,350
more softer or more sharp and think

18
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:05,920
about if that changed how we thought the

19
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,710
conversation we're going we also

20
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:12,070
discussed about iconography of the

21
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:13,540
jacket cover on the Lee code and

22
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:16,270
everything so this was the first time I

23
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:18,760
realized that there's a certain pledges

24
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:22,390
thing as nonverbal communications the

25
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:25,390
communication that your eyes or your

26
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:28,090
ears or just getting some kind of signal

27
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:30,370
from light or the it will wave on the

28
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:35,530
air and somehow we or just analyzing it

29
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:37,990
without even thinking and doing certain

30
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:39,640
kind of communication and this was

31
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:42,400
really fascinating to me so I studied

32
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,230
communication in college and also a

33
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:47,650
visual anthropology and my first job out

34
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:51,070
of college was a online video sharing

35
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:53,200
community site and now I woke as a web

36
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,560
developer making text editors but making

37
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,930
of clinical applications or websites or

38
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:02,200
designing a system to me was always

39
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,510
creating a means of communication for

40
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:07,500
humans to me it was never about

41
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,700
connecting a two computers or two

42
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:15,580
programs together so can't day we are

43
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:18,269
surrounded by non verbal or visual

44
00:02:18,269 --> 00:02:20,560
communications or sound communication

45
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,010
really how many of you have like all of

46
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:26,469
these application in your pocket like

47
00:02:26,469 --> 00:02:28,780
there's so many applications that use

48
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:31,270
sound elements so many applications that

49
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:34,420
use picture element we are all

50
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:36,640
surrounded by it and even as a

51
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,380
programmer this is a really exciting

52
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:41,530
time that a lot of research on image

53
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:43,209
processing and computer vision is

54
00:02:43,209 --> 00:02:46,090
happening this is the example of doing a

55
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:48,850
style transfer which is a way to use

56
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:51,010
machine learning to analyze the picture

57
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:53,890
and apply the style and technique so

58
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:57,790
painting into another picture you might

59
00:02:57,790 --> 00:02:59,860
also know the deep dream from the google

60
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:04,150
lab so even in the Lee search field the

61
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:11,880
exciting thing is happening so

62
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:14,110
discovering this type of communication

63
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:16,600
was really fascinating to me because as

64
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:19,239
a human eyes whoa this is really big

65
00:03:19,239 --> 00:03:22,959
picture like us looking at this picture

66
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:26,670
how many green circle in this picture

67
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:30,280
one how many yellow squares are in this

68
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:33,220
fixture one yeah this is interactive one

69
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:35,620
so like you can just tell me so like you

70
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:37,720
eat last programmer thinks that like you

71
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,640
know really like to write a logic and

72
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:43,030
like really like flexed logical thinking

73
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:45,430
muscles but when you're looking at it

74
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:46,900
and then like when I ask you like how

75
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:48,700
many yellow squares are there you don't

76
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:49,930
need to think about like if else

77
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:52,870
statement you just like there's one like

78
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:55,269
you don't even think or you don't even

79
00:03:55,269 --> 00:03:56,709
know that you were thinking in your

80
00:03:56,709 --> 00:03:59,140
brain and this is really interesting and

81
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:02,140
frustrating when you are trying to make

82
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:05,019
an application that deals with visual

83
00:04:05,019 --> 00:04:07,390
element so I want to show you one sample

84
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:10,450
that I'm hey last year i made a

85
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:16,530
application let's call sweater if I I I

86
00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:19,239
work as a software engineer on my day

87
00:04:19,239 --> 00:04:22,720
job but on my side on my side project I

88
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,990
really like to create a tools and um

89
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:28,539
program to design a textile and this was

90
00:04:28,539 --> 00:04:30,850
around Christmas time so I wanted to

91
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:32,919
make something fun something people can

92
00:04:32,919 --> 00:04:36,370
just do so I'm a ugly sweater generator

93
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:38,409
or in British term I guess Christmas

94
00:04:38,409 --> 00:04:41,650
jumper generator you can just upload the

95
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:42,520
picture

96
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:46,080
then I will make it into a sweater foam

97
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,599
to me this is not even perfect because I

98
00:04:49,599 --> 00:04:52,870
see this image and in my mind there is

99
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:56,370
like a vivid image of like me should be

100
00:04:56,370 --> 00:05:00,190
extracted more there is clear border

101
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:05,919
between clear border between here in the

102
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:10,259
background and my hair but when I do

103
00:05:10,259 --> 00:05:14,199
applied it to the text align there is no

104
00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:17,229
border here and like how do I even tell

105
00:05:17,229 --> 00:05:20,259
my program where is me and where's my

106
00:05:20,259 --> 00:05:22,630
background and got me really interested

107
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:25,060
in this topic of Miss processing and

108
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:28,030
computer vision when you google computer

109
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:31,120
visions you would probably find some

110
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,130
kind of libraries may popular one is

111
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:36,219
open CD and there's a whole bunch of

112
00:05:36,219 --> 00:05:38,740
document about how to use it so many

113
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:42,009
back so many blog posts about a tutorial

114
00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:44,379
of using this library my main

115
00:05:44,379 --> 00:05:47,259
frustration was that all of them were

116
00:05:47,259 --> 00:05:50,770
about how to talk to this API how to use

117
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:53,110
this tool that's doing something that I

118
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:54,490
don't understand and none of them

119
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:57,699
explain what actually this library is

120
00:05:57,699 --> 00:06:01,300
doing and then you know as I mentioned

121
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:03,669
there's things like very trendy topic in

122
00:06:03,669 --> 00:06:06,610
lasers like deep deep learning and deep

123
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:11,080
dream that you almost started feeling

124
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:13,000
like it's just like something that like

125
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,819
via links to research facility it's just

126
00:06:15,819 --> 00:06:17,830
like really over top of my head and I

127
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:20,229
can't really understand like I don't

128
00:06:20,229 --> 00:06:23,259
know so when we were looking at object

129
00:06:23,259 --> 00:06:26,080
from human I we can immediately identify

130
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:29,139
certain attributes like colors of the

131
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:31,840
object height of the object name of the

132
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,819
object that's commonly known in the

133
00:06:33,819 --> 00:06:36,130
society but the problem with computer

134
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:38,590
vision is they don't look at that object

135
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:40,630
a look at digital representation the

136
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:43,300
digital photo of the object and this is

137
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:45,729
a photo of the object is really just a

138
00:06:45,729 --> 00:06:48,789
whole bunch of bytes and bits in there

139
00:06:48,789 --> 00:06:51,039
so the robots or the computer program or

140
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:52,509
computer whatever you want to call is

141
00:06:52,509 --> 00:06:54,940
just looking at that number and my

142
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:56,020
question

143
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:58,979
is how do we tell that person that lava

144
00:06:58,979 --> 00:07:02,889
how to lead that like us humans do with

145
00:07:02,889 --> 00:07:06,460
these orange attributes and another

146
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:08,409
question is that is it really like Alli

147
00:07:08,409 --> 00:07:09,819
Leigh difficult thing to do that you

148
00:07:09,819 --> 00:07:12,099
have to help PhD or can I just use it

149
00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:14,590
what can I just do it in the platform

150
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:16,419
that I'm really most familiar with and

151
00:07:16,419 --> 00:07:17,500
the language that are most comfortable

152
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:20,379
which is JavaScript and the answer is

153
00:07:20,379 --> 00:07:22,539
yes you can use canvas element and we'll

154
00:07:22,539 --> 00:07:24,460
get to that but before we get to that I

155
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:26,590
have a announcement not disclaimer

156
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:28,960
announcement I consider myself as a

157
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:33,520
translator I it's not really between two

158
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:36,669
different languages but translator in

159
00:07:36,669 --> 00:07:38,130
the sense of providing different

160
00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:41,340
perspective I have a tendency to draw

161
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:45,069
all over the technical documents I have

162
00:07:45,069 --> 00:07:47,590
tendency to use a lot of analogy to

163
00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:50,770
explain certain concepts so the stuff

164
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:52,750
that I'm gonna do today my look

165
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:56,379
unfamiliar or weird and I'm sorry if

166
00:07:56,379 --> 00:07:59,909
that's the case but I really think that

167
00:07:59,909 --> 00:08:03,039
there is a value in having different

168
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:05,169
perspective not just only having one

169
00:08:05,169 --> 00:08:07,180
traditional way of describing computer

170
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:09,310
science but having a different

171
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:11,590
perspective in this field so I'm gonna

172
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:17,259
do that so image as i mentioned digital

173
00:08:17,259 --> 00:08:20,259
image is just a bite that computer is

174
00:08:20,259 --> 00:08:22,539
looking at so like how how can we look

175
00:08:22,539 --> 00:08:25,029
at that number ones and zeros and matrix

176
00:08:25,029 --> 00:08:27,520
e thing so i made a special image so

177
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,289
like if you like stir yourself in the

178
00:08:29,289 --> 00:08:33,399
center and then the craft right down and

179
00:08:33,399 --> 00:08:35,740
then go cup and then just like focus on

180
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:38,649
the center for like 10 seconds then you

181
00:08:38,649 --> 00:08:42,190
will look start to look at this like do

182
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:45,010
you see it you see the zeros and ones no

183
00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:47,920
no no no it's not like that it doesn't

184
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,829
look like that you have to write a code

185
00:08:49,829 --> 00:08:52,420
so as i mentioned i use the canvas

186
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:56,470
element canvas is a HTML 5 element that

187
00:08:56,470 --> 00:09:00,940
let you write a tough draw a picture on

188
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:04,209
your browser using javascript so it's a

189
00:09:04,209 --> 00:09:07,120
perfect element to do this job

190
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:10,240
to create a canvas is just as easy as

191
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,940
creating any other kind of ACM element

192
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:14,860
just clear to element in canvas or you

193
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:16,480
just type it in the canvas tag and

194
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,850
reference by ID and you need to specify

195
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:21,339
size of that and I'd like to think this

196
00:09:21,339 --> 00:09:24,370
process as for this day's as like you

197
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:26,620
reserved certain piece of land somewhere

198
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:29,260
but you don't know where it is yet you

199
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:31,450
need to know because you don't know like

200
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:33,640
whether this land is in Iceland and

201
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:36,460
speaks mysoline language or this is in

202
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:38,850
New York in the middle of like heist

203
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:40,779
skyscraper so you need to give some

204
00:09:40,779 --> 00:09:43,779
context to this piece of plan and you

205
00:09:43,779 --> 00:09:46,240
exactly give the context but I doing get

206
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,850
context you specify what kind of context

207
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:51,610
you want i'm using 2d context but you

208
00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:54,490
can also specify WebGL to do the GPU

209
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:58,320
programming but at this point you know

210
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,779
exactly what kind of language and what

211
00:10:01,779 --> 00:10:03,400
kind of method that you're getting out

212
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,230
of this context once you have the

213
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:08,170
context you can draw amazing do this by

214
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:11,320
through the context so contact start

215
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:15,459
draw image and pass a image into it

216
00:10:15,459 --> 00:10:19,209
we'll put a digital image into canvas

217
00:10:19,209 --> 00:10:22,180
element and now your javascript king in

218
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:25,450
track to interact with this fixture in

219
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:28,300
order to get that data whatever the

220
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:30,339
computer is looking at there is a method

221
00:10:30,339 --> 00:10:33,730
called get image data and then you

222
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:37,150
extract the data out of the canvas so

223
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:40,290
let's look at what in this data element

224
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:43,750
this is what image data looks like just

225
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:45,490
imagine you have a three by three ed

226
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:47,950
tiny pixel that's just like super and

227
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:51,580
lowers into this screen and the left

228
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:54,880
left of it is what looks like if you

229
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,890
call get a nice data and then get the

230
00:10:56,890 --> 00:10:59,440
data out of it it's just a JavaScript

231
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,510
object certain attributes are very

232
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:04,300
obvious width and height is a width and

233
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:06,940
height of the image with a pixel unit

234
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:09,310
and then there was data and there's

235
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:12,070
whole bunch of numbers that you need to

236
00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:15,190
understand but this is ingredient what

237
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:18,160
constitute this picture so in order to

238
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,079
understand what this data is the way you

239
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:20,740
need to under

240
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:23,500
than what's in a single pixel if I drew

241
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,779
the single pixel which looks really big

242
00:11:25,779 --> 00:11:29,110
in here I also gave eyes to kind of I

243
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:30,910
humanize it a little bit so that you

244
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:33,390
like you know get familiar with pixel

245
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:37,110
underneath the pixel is full values

246
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:40,720
first three you can think of it as a

247
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,660
different colored of light bulbs red

248
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:45,820
green and blue and a force one will get

249
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:50,020
to it but you can control how blight

250
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:53,680
each color of the light bulb is so if i

251
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,660
turn the red light bulb all the way up

252
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:58,959
and turn off green and blue then your

253
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:01,930
pixel becomes red if you do the other

254
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:05,290
colors you know slightly greenish and

255
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:07,839
you can start mixing the colors in lgb

256
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:11,860
space if you have same values for each

257
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:14,380
of three you always get gray different

258
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:16,570
shades of gray but you always get gray

259
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:21,250
and this always get grey comes important

260
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:24,420
later in this talk but you can see that

261
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:27,850
right the force number is opacity so

262
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:29,890
this is purely for software to know if

263
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:32,290
some images are overweight how much

264
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:34,750
should I brand it in to lender it on

265
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:37,510
your screen so you can see I have

266
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:40,630
slightly less paucity and you can play

267
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:43,899
around pretty much you specify lgb a on

268
00:12:43,899 --> 00:12:49,589
your CSS it just comes in four numbers

269
00:12:49,589 --> 00:12:56,800
so so now this data start to make sense

270
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:00,190
I Pat it by just a chunk of four so that

271
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:02,500
it's easier to lead and from top left

272
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:05,680
corner to the bottom right corner each

273
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:09,700
pixel has four numbers for them so let's

274
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:12,459
do the same thing here that first pixel

275
00:13:12,459 --> 00:13:15,100
because it is a first for it should be

276
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:18,430
top left corner hopefully let's see

277
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:20,920
let's make it into green so I turn off

278
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:23,680
all the rape red light bulb which is our

279
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:26,860
first value and then I turn the green

280
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:30,160
channel all the way after 255 and then

281
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:33,040
turn off the blue and update and then it

282
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,990
should turn into agree so this is how

283
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:38,949
the most basic way you edit a digital

284
00:13:38,949 --> 00:13:42,160
image and we will deplete do that for

285
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:47,050
all of the pixel from now on now kind of

286
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:49,900
thinking this one-dimensional array data

287
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:53,199
in two-dimensional space is a little

288
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:56,140
hard but what leading made sense to me

289
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:58,570
was when one of my mentor explained to

290
00:13:58,570 --> 00:14:01,329
me the way this this way so when you're

291
00:14:01,329 --> 00:14:03,670
writing a letter to somebody in your

292
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:05,620
head you don't need to think about ok so

293
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:08,589
this paper fits 20 characters so I'm

294
00:14:08,589 --> 00:14:10,029
going to think about 20 character first

295
00:14:10,029 --> 00:14:11,890
and then for next sentence i'm gonna

296
00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:13,600
stick like a mother 20 character know

297
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,459
your blend is thinking just like stream

298
00:14:15,459 --> 00:14:18,459
of data and then when you put it onto

299
00:14:18,459 --> 00:14:21,070
the paper you just unconsciously going

300
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:23,110
up I lined out of space not a lie

301
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:26,560
another face another line so in a way

302
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,690
that the what's in your head is the data

303
00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:31,540
that you see and they miss data and what

304
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:34,089
transfer to the paper is what you are

305
00:14:34,089 --> 00:14:37,649
looking at on the screen as a texture so

306
00:14:37,649 --> 00:14:40,630
now we know how to get to the data and

307
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:42,399
how to get to the pixels and how to

308
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:44,020
change the color of the pixel let's do

309
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:46,060
something fun I hope it translates well

310
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:47,770
on the screen but let's do something

311
00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:49,839
like image filter the Instagram filter

312
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:52,060
if you research how to do the image

313
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:54,370
filter you look at you discover the

314
00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:56,529
squiggly functions that's called a plump

315
00:14:56,529 --> 00:15:00,370
I can't even pronounce Oh basically

316
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:02,470
master and a whole bunch of maybe glass

317
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:04,779
but it's like always a grey and like

318
00:15:04,779 --> 00:15:07,180
black I like to think of it as like

319
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:09,100
introducing a social construct to this

320
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:11,589
like pixel social world because it's

321
00:15:11,589 --> 00:15:14,770
really just setting a rule that all of

322
00:15:14,770 --> 00:15:17,470
the pixel follows for this texture so

323
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:19,660
like age group who's allowed to use

324
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:23,140
playground certain days you have to go

325
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:26,079
to school you have to start paying tax

326
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:27,880
once you go through to school like all

327
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:30,130
of those things you just define it and

328
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:32,589
then you apply it to all of the pics

329
00:15:32,589 --> 00:15:37,630
pixels so here is a function that's

330
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:41,699
visualized in a data visualization in

331
00:15:41,699 --> 00:15:44,260
the case that you're not applying a

332
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:46,160
filter you were just like getting image

333
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:49,339
in and same image out it looks like this

334
00:15:49,339 --> 00:15:52,569
so let's say your light bulb is

335
00:15:52,569 --> 00:15:54,500
illuminating the red light bulb is

336
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:57,259
eliminating 181 the output of it is

337
00:15:57,259 --> 00:15:59,360
always 181 and you know it doesn't

338
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,509
change anything and I colored it in the

339
00:16:02,509 --> 00:16:06,879
gradient of red green and blue just to

340
00:16:06,879 --> 00:16:10,250
specify that all of the three lights are

341
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:13,370
going through this function so if you

342
00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:15,529
have a 1 pixel then you do the same

343
00:16:15,529 --> 00:16:17,899
thing for three times for each channel

344
00:16:17,899 --> 00:16:20,689
all of them follow the same who'll but

345
00:16:20,689 --> 00:16:21,860
then like you know changing the

346
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:24,649
brightness you slightly change those

347
00:16:24,649 --> 00:16:28,689
carbs so in this case let's say blyton

348
00:16:28,689 --> 00:16:35,629
all of the pixel so there's a 72 161 so

349
00:16:35,629 --> 00:16:39,230
that's what like 73 is like all of the

350
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:42,230
pixel that go seeing gets more blatant

351
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:45,250
and then comes out the contrast is

352
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:48,829
similar to brightness but it's changing

353
00:16:48,829 --> 00:16:52,339
a slope of the curve so here is a high

354
00:16:52,339 --> 00:16:54,410
contrast it is here is a low contrast

355
00:16:54,410 --> 00:16:57,170
image in no contrast case input is so

356
00:16:57,170 --> 00:16:59,720
from 0 to 255 you haven't altered

357
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,970
anything on the input side but the

358
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:07,569
output is limited to in this case 56 to

359
00:17:07,569 --> 00:17:12,289
190 200 so it slightly lose the color

360
00:17:12,289 --> 00:17:14,600
that's possible and it doesn't have to

361
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:15,980
be straight line there is this thing

362
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:18,409
called posterization and it's basically

363
00:17:18,409 --> 00:17:21,380
glue p'ing the pixels together based on

364
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:24,049
the number so in this case any pixel or

365
00:17:24,049 --> 00:17:27,980
any any data that has 155 to two or

366
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:31,909
three all gets 192 and this way you get

367
00:17:31,909 --> 00:17:35,830
this pollster eyes effect of color is

368
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:39,909
limited and it's kind of fun to do so

369
00:17:39,909 --> 00:17:43,159
now that we know how to get the data how

370
00:17:43,159 --> 00:17:46,400
to change the color how about changing a

371
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,100
structure of the picture like blur and

372
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:53,630
sharp image to do that you need to do

373
00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:55,220
some kind of mass called corner

374
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:57,289
convolution which I feel like it sounds

375
00:17:57,289 --> 00:17:59,240
like a yummy cereal but I'd like to

376
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:00,050
think that as

377
00:18:00,050 --> 00:18:01,970
thinking about a social graph of the

378
00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:04,190
pixels we introduce a social construct

379
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:05,450
but then you know within the social

380
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:09,110
construct of the world you know it has a

381
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:11,120
lot of relationship in it and you need

382
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:13,550
to think about those things so here's

383
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:15,290
one pixel that we want to change the

384
00:18:15,290 --> 00:18:17,570
color to change the structure of this

385
00:18:17,570 --> 00:18:21,350
image you the pixel has a sounding

386
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:24,560
friends and in case of blur let's think

387
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:27,110
about it you want to blend it in as much

388
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:29,990
as possible to your neighbors so you lay

389
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:32,720
yourself and your neighbors equally and

390
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:36,230
you get the other ways color of all of

391
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:38,390
the nine pixels and then you change your

392
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:41,900
color to that average color in the

393
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:44,270
bigger picture so let's say you see here

394
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:47,150
is a distinct red line going across you

395
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:50,900
do that mass for each single one of the

396
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:53,420
pixel going through and result of that

397
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:57,980
is blurred image so this is a box floor

398
00:18:57,980 --> 00:19:00,740
that we just did let's see how r / this

399
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:04,280
is original blurred orginal blurred but

400
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:06,950
in reality though like not all of your

401
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:09,350
friend is like equally important right

402
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:10,970
you have a best friend and you have a

403
00:19:10,970 --> 00:19:13,100
distant friend so in that case you can

404
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:14,630
use something like Gaussian blur or you

405
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:17,750
can make your own matrix that you want

406
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:19,910
to introduce in Gaussian blur case they

407
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:22,130
use normal distribution so you're closer

408
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:25,130
friend gets laid it higher and then your

409
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:26,780
distant friend which is on the corner

410
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:31,420
get high elated lore and it's slightly

411
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:35,060
edged preserving way of doing the blur

412
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:37,820
and if you ever wondered why SVG filters

413
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:40,010
you have to type Gaussian blur that's

414
00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:42,110
because the type of matrix that got the

415
00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:45,190
SVG filter uses is a Gaussian filter

416
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:48,020
sharp on the other hand is the opposite

417
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,310
you don't want to blend it into your

418
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:51,230
friend you want to be unique like you

419
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:53,270
you really want to stand out in that

420
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:55,370
case you you laid yourself the center

421
00:19:55,370 --> 00:19:58,370
context or later so really high while

422
00:19:58,370 --> 00:20:02,150
you don't want to get the inference from

423
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:04,220
your friends like late at zero or you

424
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:06,290
even want to like learn opposite like if

425
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:07,760
you're doing the saying that I'm gonna

426
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:10,190
go the other way so like you Nick lady

427
00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:13,170
negatively and then that produces a

428
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:16,720
sharped image so here's always no sharp

429
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:21,970
and slightly maybe you can see it right

430
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:23,560
so if you want to play around all of

431
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:26,080
these filters I have a library that's

432
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:29,350
called graph ejs that let you easily try

433
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:32,440
out those Salters I kind of designed it

434
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:35,530
thinking like underscore but for image

435
00:20:35,530 --> 00:20:37,750
processing so you can pass any of the

436
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:39,280
image data and then you specify the

437
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:42,010
parameters and you get an image data

438
00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:43,780
object out which is the processed

439
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:45,610
version of image so if you want to play

440
00:20:45,610 --> 00:20:49,930
run you can look at those so now that we

441
00:20:49,930 --> 00:20:52,330
know how to get the data how to eat the

442
00:20:52,330 --> 00:20:54,070
data how to change that and how to

443
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:56,290
change a little bit of structure let's

444
00:20:56,290 --> 00:20:58,270
think about neighborhoods because much

445
00:20:58,270 --> 00:21:00,550
like the city is consistent of many

446
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:02,710
different neighborhood based on whatever

447
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:06,040
that reviews that we carry the image has

448
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:08,170
interesting parts of the image important

449
00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:09,490
parts of the image and they're not

450
00:21:09,490 --> 00:21:11,320
interesting parts or differently

451
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:13,570
interesting parts of the image so how

452
00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:16,270
can we get that information out of this

453
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:19,420
image in order to do this you need to do

454
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:22,620
like plea processing for like two things

455
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:25,660
one is upscaling and one new fresh

456
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:27,790
holding and let's go through those two

457
00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:30,310
so that we can define neighborhood so

458
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:33,220
there is a little let's grayscale it as

459
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:36,160
I mentioned all the pixel have sweet

460
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:40,510
values gray scaling is the way to think

461
00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:43,060
that how bright each pixel is you don't

462
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:45,670
care about the color of the pixel you

463
00:21:45,670 --> 00:21:47,770
are just interested in how blight are

464
00:21:47,770 --> 00:21:49,360
you're like what's your important like

465
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:53,050
the true self inside so how do we do

466
00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:54,730
that because we have three numbers how

467
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:57,040
can we do that well we can take very

468
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:59,530
naive uploads you're just picking one so

469
00:21:59,530 --> 00:22:02,860
in this case I picked green and just use

470
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:05,410
that all over and it didn't work the the

471
00:22:05,410 --> 00:22:08,050
bottom half disappeared because the

472
00:22:08,050 --> 00:22:10,840
green channel on the bottom half objects

473
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:14,220
turn on happens to be 0 and 0 so it just

474
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:17,560
Talent down so how about like if we

475
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:20,620
average it out it's getting there it

476
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:22,780
looks like gray scale image but here is

477
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:26,570
a problem for us the human eyes die

478
00:22:26,570 --> 00:22:29,630
Green Square it looks like much brighter

479
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:33,769
than the one on the blue one but in this

480
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:37,399
average grayscale image those are two or

481
00:22:37,399 --> 00:22:40,220
same if you look at numbers it makes

482
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:42,889
sense because both of them have same

483
00:22:42,889 --> 00:22:46,600
amount of numbers in the pixel why

484
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:49,460
because our human eyes are heavily

485
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:53,440
biased towards one color which is green

486
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,789
so when you look at it even with our

487
00:22:55,789 --> 00:22:58,549
thinking you feel like green it's

488
00:22:58,549 --> 00:23:00,649
blighter you you feel like green is

489
00:23:00,649 --> 00:23:04,850
valuable and you need to this proposed

490
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:07,100
interesting question of like we alter

491
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:10,940
our code so that it works with our

492
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:14,659
cognitive bias which is doing a loom

493
00:23:14,659 --> 00:23:17,029
according so the recording is the coding

494
00:23:17,029 --> 00:23:19,340
that used in the TV industry it's

495
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:21,320
basically giving a privilege in each

496
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:24,710
green channel while not really giving a

497
00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:28,250
previous on blue and the red channel and

498
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:30,909
then output of that looks slightly like

499
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:34,850
natural quoting coil for us is not your

500
00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:37,549
not natural in the numbers but natural

501
00:23:37,549 --> 00:23:40,159
for our eyes okay we got through the

502
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:41,990
gray scaling another one it's a

503
00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:45,230
threshold once you have a grayscale you

504
00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:48,169
got little three channel thing you will

505
00:23:48,169 --> 00:23:50,299
now only have information about how

506
00:23:50,299 --> 00:23:52,519
blade that pixel is but you want to get

507
00:23:52,519 --> 00:23:56,679
down to more more smaller number so you

508
00:23:56,679 --> 00:23:58,909
the gray scale is the image that

509
00:23:58,909 --> 00:24:03,710
contains a number from 0 to 255 so 256

510
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:06,889
shades of gray threshold eng is the way

511
00:24:06,889 --> 00:24:09,889
to make the image into just black and

512
00:24:09,889 --> 00:24:13,970
white and nothing in between so in this

513
00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:20,029
last case we have a let's see if i want

514
00:24:20,029 --> 00:24:23,299
to extract this light bulb corner then i

515
00:24:23,299 --> 00:24:26,110
would just slightly alter this and then

516
00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:29,059
here threshold it so anything that's

517
00:24:29,059 --> 00:24:32,570
below 153 gets zero anything a Papa gets

518
00:24:32,570 --> 00:24:34,879
to 55 and you get black and white

519
00:24:34,879 --> 00:24:38,419
photography so once we have that and we

520
00:24:38,419 --> 00:24:40,250
kind of isolated the

521
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:42,680
object that you are interested in the

522
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:46,310
picture ended up like this well let's

523
00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:48,380
just imagine that picture end up like

524
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:51,140
this so we kind of like grayscale did

525
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:52,790
and adjusted the threshold and then

526
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:55,310
isolated it so how can we tell computers

527
00:24:55,310 --> 00:25:00,080
how to identify what's in it because

528
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:02,330
I'll humanize it's easily you can tell

529
00:25:02,330 --> 00:25:04,280
there's a two white lesions in this

530
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:08,060
image and the shape of the image like

531
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:09,980
which is larger and which is smaller but

532
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:12,650
in computers case remember it only knows

533
00:25:12,650 --> 00:25:16,340
is it black or white they don't have any

534
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:19,370
idea about the shape so how can we tell

535
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:21,230
computer that so it's still computer

536
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:23,590
that which is called labouring so

537
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:25,730
computer goes to reform the top left

538
00:25:25,730 --> 00:25:28,340
corner and then finds first white pixel

539
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:30,560
and then says okay I found a white pixel

540
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:32,810
its label at one go through another

541
00:25:32,810 --> 00:25:35,810
second color and then find another one

542
00:25:35,810 --> 00:25:37,880
and then ask the questions same question

543
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:41,330
it's white is it any way connected to

544
00:25:41,330 --> 00:25:44,660
the pixel that I'm already identified no

545
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:48,640
so label says to this one is interesting

546
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:51,350
it's the ask the same question I found a

547
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:53,120
white pixel is it connected to anything

548
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:55,970
that I already identified as a human

549
00:25:55,970 --> 00:25:58,040
eyes it's clearly connected to other

550
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:59,930
white pixels but remember at this point

551
00:25:59,930 --> 00:26:02,720
computer doesn't know rest of it it only

552
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:05,480
knows the past though so it says okay

553
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:07,430
it's not connected I kind of a level

554
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:10,370
three next one it's now clearly knows

555
00:26:10,370 --> 00:26:13,010
that it is connected on the top and left

556
00:26:13,010 --> 00:26:15,950
side and it says okay I'm gonna label it

557
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:18,710
one but taken note that three was also a

558
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:20,780
possibility and then do the same thing

559
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:23,680
and then come back to that knee mode

560
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:27,440
labels we that was like you know come

561
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:30,260
back and then the eval evaluators pixel

562
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:32,300
and indeed it is connected to label one

563
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:34,940
so you get one so now at this point

564
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:38,210
computer knows there's two interesting

565
00:26:38,210 --> 00:26:42,020
place in this picture however what they

566
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:45,860
don't know yet is where it is or where

567
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:49,520
the border is so we need to find the

568
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,950
edge of each object how do we do that

569
00:26:51,950 --> 00:26:53,839
kind of the same

570
00:26:53,839 --> 00:26:56,129
computer finds the first white pixel

571
00:26:56,129 --> 00:26:59,099
again and because it is the first one it

572
00:26:59,099 --> 00:27:02,609
defines as a border and then it does a

573
00:27:02,609 --> 00:27:03,959
slightly different thing going through

574
00:27:03,959 --> 00:27:07,259
the edges so it asks is the left side of

575
00:27:07,259 --> 00:27:12,959
me white no so move on is the left

576
00:27:12,959 --> 00:27:15,299
bottom side of me white it's white so

577
00:27:15,299 --> 00:27:17,729
okay so I move on to that and label that

578
00:27:17,729 --> 00:27:20,999
as a border so do the same thing is it y

579
00:27:20,999 --> 00:27:25,379
know is it white no is it why yes so do

580
00:27:25,379 --> 00:27:27,869
that and then now computer knows where

581
00:27:27,869 --> 00:27:32,459
the border of the interesting part is so

582
00:27:32,459 --> 00:27:34,759
at this point our robots or computer

583
00:27:34,759 --> 00:27:38,399
knows looking at this or like give the

584
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:42,599
data of this nose hmm let's see I think

585
00:27:42,599 --> 00:27:44,009
about the question that they can answer

586
00:27:44,009 --> 00:27:45,899
they can answer there's three

587
00:27:45,899 --> 00:27:48,719
interesting parts in this picture they

588
00:27:48,719 --> 00:27:51,419
can if I ask like where is that yellowy

589
00:27:51,419 --> 00:27:53,399
part of the interesting part they will

590
00:27:53,399 --> 00:27:56,129
point to the middle if I ask like other

591
00:27:56,129 --> 00:27:58,229
color will point to the other one but

592
00:27:58,229 --> 00:28:01,229
what they cannot tell is like a question

593
00:28:01,229 --> 00:28:04,859
like which one is round or which one is

594
00:28:04,859 --> 00:28:07,289
triangular and at this point you can

595
00:28:07,289 --> 00:28:12,659
think of many ways to label or like find

596
00:28:12,659 --> 00:28:15,570
that information you can go into machine

597
00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:18,179
learning and just try to train the level

598
00:28:18,179 --> 00:28:20,369
to like by giving them a lot of

599
00:28:20,369 --> 00:28:23,159
references or you can go into using a

600
00:28:23,159 --> 00:28:27,899
lot of a skip in my mind a lot of

601
00:28:27,899 --> 00:28:30,929
geometry masks to try to find out the

602
00:28:30,929 --> 00:28:33,570
shape of the image so for now I'm

603
00:28:33,570 --> 00:28:35,219
running out of time so let's do one

604
00:28:35,219 --> 00:28:38,820
quick demo of how to find a circle in

605
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:42,539
this image in order to find circle there

606
00:28:42,539 --> 00:28:45,499
is a very simple mathematical function

607
00:28:45,499 --> 00:28:48,179
that you can apply and it's called

608
00:28:48,179 --> 00:28:51,959
circular shape factor the calculation is

609
00:28:51,959 --> 00:28:54,989
for pi times area / circumference it

610
00:28:54,989 --> 00:28:56,759
sounds like math but we already know

611
00:28:56,759 --> 00:28:59,219
those information area because we

612
00:28:59,219 --> 00:29:02,459
labeled it with one or two rays so we

613
00:29:02,459 --> 00:29:04,499
already know how big each of the object

614
00:29:04,499 --> 00:29:07,380
is and so conference is the edge of

615
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:09,660
objects so we labeled it so we know the

616
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:12,330
lengths of the circumference so we all

617
00:29:12,330 --> 00:29:14,760
have a number that we can just put it

618
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:16,740
into this formula and get number out

619
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:20,400
this shape factor returns one if the

620
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:23,760
object is completely circle and as the

621
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:27,720
object move further away from the circle

622
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:31,260
the number goes down so if I were to try

623
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:34,190
to find a circle then you can just learn

624
00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:36,990
this function and then just kind of set

625
00:29:36,990 --> 00:29:40,020
the / hold up if the value comes out of

626
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:43,410
this is 12.9 then I'm gonna say this is

627
00:29:43,410 --> 00:29:48,090
around so I have a one quick demo that I

628
00:29:48,090 --> 00:29:56,370
need which is to find circles so here I

629
00:29:56,370 --> 00:29:59,850
have two socks I organized a meetup in

630
00:29:59,850 --> 00:30:01,890
Brooklyn Kobuk enjoy us and for our to

631
00:30:01,890 --> 00:30:04,290
universally we made a JavaScript socks

632
00:30:04,290 --> 00:30:07,500
and also I have my own socks that is

633
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:09,840
slightly similar patterns it's like you

634
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,520
know different shapes and then one shape

635
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:14,400
is circle and one shape is triangle so

636
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:17,730
let's see if I put it over there and as

637
00:30:17,730 --> 00:30:20,430
I explained the you can see the original

638
00:30:20,430 --> 00:30:22,800
picture glace killed one and how i

639
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:25,710
extracted the threshold let's ask our

640
00:30:25,710 --> 00:30:28,590
lobo if this is a JavaScript socks and

641
00:30:28,590 --> 00:30:30,420
it says it looks like a job as good

642
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:33,750
socks and then let's give try and go on

643
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:37,320
and let's say if it says so not so you

644
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:39,360
know same thing and interested and it's

645
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:42,170
just know this sucks is not just powered

646
00:30:42,170 --> 00:30:44,670
because I applied the function saying

647
00:30:44,670 --> 00:30:47,430
like a circle is a triangular and you

648
00:30:47,430 --> 00:30:50,040
know you can see and the threshold the

649
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:51,630
object that comes out of the threshold

650
00:30:51,630 --> 00:30:53,820
is certainly rounder than this one which

651
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:57,210
is clearly triangle I have to click on

652
00:30:57,210 --> 00:31:00,990
it it would be great to kind of not do

653
00:31:00,990 --> 00:31:02,970
that in automatically detect but there's

654
00:31:02,970 --> 00:31:05,820
a challenge in browser see as I

655
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:07,890
mentioned there's so many much going on

656
00:31:07,890 --> 00:31:09,990
like you know even the demo that was

657
00:31:09,990 --> 00:31:11,910
like tiny there's so many pixels and

658
00:31:11,910 --> 00:31:13,350
there's switch on also of each of them

659
00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:15,390
so so many so many so many months are

660
00:31:15,390 --> 00:31:17,610
going on that browser gets really

661
00:31:17,610 --> 00:31:20,010
unhappy if you're doing it in your

662
00:31:20,010 --> 00:31:22,200
thread so I'd suggest that you just

663
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,240
investigate using something like web

664
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,400
worker and I like to think what worker

665
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:28,980
is like International Space Station to

666
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:33,450
us the browser Dom that is the arse it

667
00:31:33,450 --> 00:31:35,310
is something that we want and it is

668
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:37,110
something that we created we communicate

669
00:31:37,110 --> 00:31:39,480
data over it and do any math and

670
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:41,520
scientific research over there and you

671
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:43,710
get the data out but the International

672
00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:46,470
Space Station does not belong in the

673
00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:48,300
worse so it doesn't have access to DOM

674
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:51,300
no access to window so you can only

675
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:53,550
communicate over data well you might ask

676
00:31:53,550 --> 00:31:55,260
like how about service workers the buzz

677
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:57,120
word well I like to think service worker

678
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:00,750
as like UFO which is a similar thing

679
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:03,870
it's in the space but there is so many

680
00:32:03,870 --> 00:32:06,090
leg up work that browser provides like

681
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:08,070
background sync and push notifications

682
00:32:08,070 --> 00:32:12,210
that you are not controlling in

683
00:32:12,210 --> 00:32:14,220
wolfwalkers case in the life cycle of

684
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:16,650
your application you create a worker you

685
00:32:16,650 --> 00:32:19,230
terminate the work or you control what

686
00:32:19,230 --> 00:32:21,240
the web worker is doing service worker

687
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:23,610
same idea don't have access to dom don't

688
00:32:23,610 --> 00:32:27,390
have access to window but um it is

689
00:32:27,390 --> 00:32:29,400
something that you don't know how it's

690
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:33,240
doing on the back so the best part is

691
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:35,760
that it's really easy to start you start

692
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:38,730
a new worker and then start launch the

693
00:32:38,730 --> 00:32:41,550
survey station you import scripts if you

694
00:32:41,550 --> 00:32:43,200
want to use outside library because

695
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:45,840
again I mentioned you there's no access

696
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:48,180
to window so even if you might already

697
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:50,250
have underscoring application you have

698
00:32:50,250 --> 00:32:52,920
to install it again and the worker side

699
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:54,870
and then in between worker and main

700
00:32:54,870 --> 00:32:58,440
thread you communicate by using method

701
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:00,560
post message and listening to the all

702
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:04,860
message event and then once you're done

703
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:07,410
with it you terminate and don't you

704
00:33:07,410 --> 00:33:10,530
control entire lifecycle of workers so

705
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:13,140
here's an example of very image

706
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:15,480
processing heavy app that I made that is

707
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:19,470
not Walker door I guess I'm doing a

708
00:33:19,470 --> 00:33:22,500
bunch of blur operations and it is just

709
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:25,620
completely freeze the UI and not doing

710
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:28,770
anything and once it's done and it comes

711
00:33:28,770 --> 00:33:31,200
back all of the quick events that was

712
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,470
accumulated just like thought I ran

713
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:35,750
so this is not nearly good a good user

714
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:38,059
experience so this is a war curved

715
00:33:38,059 --> 00:33:40,730
version which animation doesn't get

716
00:33:40,730 --> 00:33:43,789
blocked you can actually see that I am

717
00:33:43,789 --> 00:33:46,190
applying a blur function again and again

718
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:50,000
and again you I works and then now it's

719
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,370
processing and it comes back as a

720
00:33:52,370 --> 00:33:54,530
processed image so it actually works

721
00:33:54,530 --> 00:33:58,390
faster too so I encourage you to

722
00:33:58,390 --> 00:34:00,919
investigate what's possible inside of

723
00:34:00,919 --> 00:34:02,720
the browser it's really easy to say oh

724
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:05,270
like you should use C because it's bare

725
00:34:05,270 --> 00:34:08,899
metal and it's fast but us we are web

726
00:34:08,899 --> 00:34:12,169
developers I hope you also some kind of

727
00:34:12,169 --> 00:34:14,750
web developers we deal with users and we

728
00:34:14,750 --> 00:34:16,849
deal with users intentions and cheating

729
00:34:16,849 --> 00:34:20,990
on the user's a text users actions so we

730
00:34:20,990 --> 00:34:24,859
can create much meaningful interaction

731
00:34:24,859 --> 00:34:27,290
by just using what's available and

732
00:34:27,290 --> 00:34:30,470
browser not even going into creating

733
00:34:30,470 --> 00:34:32,270
another app or anything browser has so

734
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:35,359
many potentials if you get inspired by

735
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:37,040
this talk and want to investigate more

736
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:39,500
have a two recommendations book of

737
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:41,990
shaders if you want to go into WebGL

738
00:34:41,990 --> 00:34:45,320
encoding patricio and gin or artist

739
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:47,629
based in New York that created a book

740
00:34:47,629 --> 00:34:50,030
that is also Illustrated and explained

741
00:34:50,030 --> 00:34:52,099
in the different point of view another

742
00:34:52,099 --> 00:34:55,510
one is a machine learning for artist

743
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:58,700
Jean teaches a machine learning class at

744
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:01,640
art school so he has a he's clean

745
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:03,890
decoded entire semester Warsaw of

746
00:35:03,890 --> 00:35:05,930
material and then put it on to github

747
00:35:05,930 --> 00:35:07,700
and you can watch it and its really

748
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:09,410
interesting creative use of machine

749
00:35:09,410 --> 00:35:15,380
learning inspired by those 2 i'm

750
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:17,660
thinking of turning these contents into

751
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:20,660

752
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:24,200
