00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:10,139

my name is Jared and I'm here to talk

2
00:00:10,139 --> 00:00:13,530
about JavaScript what could have been so

3
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:17,750
who here hated history in high school

4
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:21,359
come on more than you in that either you

5
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:22,710
had very good teachers or I went to a

6
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:25,680
crappy high school it wasn't until I hit

7
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,750
unique that history sort of started

8
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:29,699
coming alive to me mainly because it was

9
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:32,130
fairly violent I mean the Trojan horse

10
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:33,750
is a good example of this I know it's

11
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:39,210
not real history but still so the

12
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:41,129
Smithsonian has recently started trying

13
00:00:41,129 --> 00:00:42,899
to get people interested in history I

14
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:45,989
have any of you seen these ads it says

15
00:00:45,989 --> 00:00:47,700
50 cent got shot and steal White's about

16
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:49,590
it on stage Teddy Roosevelt got shot

17
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:50,940
mid-speech and didn't leave the stage

18
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:54,570
until he finished Ozzy Osbourne study

19
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:56,489
language rubbed off on his kids andrew

20
00:00:56,489 --> 00:00:58,020
jackson was so vulgar as parrot was

21
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:00,140
ejected from swearing at his funeral

22
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:02,340
Bret Michaels got with every chick on

23
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:04,260
the load bus Genghis Khan got we assume

24
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:06,060
that so many chicks as a 50-percent

25
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:07,260
there's a five percent chance that

26
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:12,299
you're related to him so hopefully I've

27
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:13,650
got you excited about history so we're

28
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:16,250
going to take a step back in history and

29
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:18,540
in the beginning God created the heavens

30
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:20,159
and the earth well that's probably a bit

31
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:21,600
too far back we probably need a computer

32
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,400
to be invented for it to be relevant to

33
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:26,490
this conference in the beginning brendan

34
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:29,880
i created the javascript now the

35
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:33,210
javascript was formless it was spread

36
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:34,680
small talk was spread throughout the job

37
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,810
that the computer science community the

38
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:38,490
spirit of self is hovering among them

39
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:41,729
and java reg has been created actually

40
00:01:41,729 --> 00:01:43,380
you've all heard that story a thousand

41
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:44,490
times before you are the JavaScript

42
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:49,290
conference so what if how many of you

43
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:51,180
asked the question what if like what

44
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:52,560
would happen if a rapper bought through

45
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,240
that door we'd probably be all screwed

46
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,329
since it's only one way out windows but

47
00:01:57,329 --> 00:02:01,350
you never know so what if Cleopatra had

48
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:02,790
been ugly would we all be living in

49
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:04,439
cities like this because she hadn't led

50
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:07,229
to the downfall of Rome what if Steve

51
00:02:07,229 --> 00:02:08,940
Jobs never took acid would it be such a

52
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:09,600
guy Connie

53
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,250
company with all the hipsters be using

54
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:15,510
PC's instead of Max but here's the thing

55
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:17,790
about history it's all well and good to

56
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:19,740
look back at the past and say well you

57
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:22,830
know what if that happened but hindsight

58
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:25,500
is always twenty-twenty this is a photo

59
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:28,860
of the Brisbane River just keep that in

60
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:33,870
mind so bit of history of myself for a

61
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:35,490
year and a half I was the I was one of

62
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:37,560
two JavaScript developers in the company

63
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:41,100
of 200 java the java developers so i

64
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:42,630
often saw this image get passed around

65
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:46,440
to me we've all laughter did I ended up

66
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:48,410
what starting to retort with this

67
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:51,450
effective Java we need a book to be good

68
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:53,580
you guys need an 800-page book just to

69
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:57,840
be effective with your language but this

70
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,180
gets me thinking what is it about Java

71
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:03,290
developers that are so violently

72
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:05,450
defensive of their language yet

73
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:08,490
javascript developers generally can we

74
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:10,290
can generally tell you whether our

75
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:12,060
favorite miss feature is I mean dr.

76
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:17,250
Crockford books is full of it don't we

77
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:18,330
all have our favorite miss feature

78
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:20,070
things like automatic semicolon

79
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:23,630
insertion type coercion things like that

80
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:26,010
when you ask a Java developer what their

81
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:27,180
fate that their least favorite thing

82
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:28,620
about the language they often stare at

83
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:29,940
you blankly like it's perfect what

84
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:34,770
you're talking about and yet who here is

85
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:38,370
a Java developer by any chance what do

86
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:43,580
you think of the language

87
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:46,750
so this is that's because you're a

88
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:47,800
JavaScript your conference you've

89
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:51,760
obviously seen the light I often

90
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,500
adamantly have to defend JavaScript a

91
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,730
paper like you know it doesn't have any

92
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:56,410
typing it doesn't do this I do it's like

93
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:57,700
you guys don't actually have first-class

94
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:59,830
functions yet and you spend so much time

95
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:02,819
writing things to get around this like

96
00:04:02,819 --> 00:04:06,520
Google's Oh like sort of semi functional

97
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:09,790
library food Java has an interface

98
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:11,370
called function which returns a function

99
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:15,880
it makes no sense that but why is it

100
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,919
that Java can do that to a job a defense

101
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:20,019
that despite all this and JavaScript we

102
00:04:20,019 --> 00:04:21,549
sort of let people attack our language

103
00:04:21,549 --> 00:04:23,770
every day and I think it is simply

104
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:26,110
because we don't we as a job developer

105
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:27,490
they knew what it was like they came

106
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:31,720
from languages like cobalt so I'm gonna

107
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,900
try and install in you the hindsight

108
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:36,340
this is the Brisbane River after the

109
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:37,690
Brisbane floods I bet they thought that

110
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:39,370
building on the bed of a river wasn't

111
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:41,680
such a good idea now so I'm going to try

112
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:45,460
and give you that hind side today so

113
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:46,990
what would have happened if Brendan Eich

114
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:48,700
hadn't slept with his coffee as a

115
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:50,200
structure interpretation of computer

116
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:55,240
programs what would have happened if

117
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:58,840
back in 1995 Microsoft happenings of

118
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,120
decided to ignore the web and actually

119
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,610
decided to embrace it and not release I

120
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:09,250
four five and six so let's take a step

121
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:10,660
back into a new reality we're going to

122
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:12,460
take a step back to 1995 and see what

123
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:13,600
would have happened if someone like

124
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,100
Microsoft would have created JavaScript

125
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:18,220
from the popular languages at times so

126
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:23,220
what was popular in 1995 cobalt

127
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:26,440
as you all know Kobol is responsible for

128
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:28,990
the famous y2k into them where we all

129
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:30,970
ended up living in volts like this it's

130
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:32,350
my own reality i can say that that

131
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:36,370
actually happen so we can probably

132
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:37,960
safely say that cobalt was on its way

133
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:41,290
out by now this book was released in

134
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:43,870
1994 that means it's all nearly old

135
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:45,370
enough to drink in nearly every country

136
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:47,020
in the world except for the u.s. does

137
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:49,240
that make you feel off it certainly made

138
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:51,940
me feel old when I looked it up but this

139
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:53,140
book is all about the object-oriented

140
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:54,670
patent so I think it's fairly safe to

141
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:55,960
say that the object-oriented thing was

142
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:58,540
well on its way up and for better or for

143
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:01,690
worse the seminal object-oriented

144
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:02,710
language at the time which was John

145
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:09,040
Strauss helps C++ so C++ it's an

146
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,960
iteration on see obviously that's the

147
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,180
joke there it's object-oriented it has

148
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:15,730
no garbage collection and templates any

149
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:17,620
C++ developer will tell you how much

150
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:20,980
they hate templates this is generally

151
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:23,680
what C++ looks like well this is

152
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,510
actually a fairly good example of C++

153
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:28,120
this is the code for query selector roll

154
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:31,660
from WebKit they've done a fantastic job

155
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:32,950
of maintaining their code base but

156
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:34,660
generally C++ ends up looking something

157
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:39,180
like this

158
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:42,590
this is the code from the standard

159
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:44,419
templating libraries push back for

160
00:06:44,419 --> 00:06:46,340
vectors so it's not like I just pulled

161
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:48,319
it from the most horrific piece of code

162
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:50,440
i can find this is in use every day and

163
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:56,330
i can't really read it okay garbage

164
00:06:56,330 --> 00:06:58,490
collection so this is 1995 garbage

165
00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:00,650
collection is a fairly new singh c++

166
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:01,729
certainly doesn't have a garbage

167
00:07:01,729 --> 00:07:03,500
collection so if we're going to create a

168
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,150
language garbage collection is probably

169
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:08,710
out so how do we manage our memory well

170
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:12,289
c++ does it through two keywords new and

171
00:07:12,289 --> 00:07:14,539
delete just like in javascript new

172
00:07:14,539 --> 00:07:17,210
creates a new object it's so that says i

173
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:19,520
have an object it's this size i need to

174
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,750
i need someone to put it the operating

175
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:22,699
system will go okay here's a chunk of

176
00:07:22,699 --> 00:07:25,699
memory from the heat right to here which

177
00:07:25,699 --> 00:07:28,009
is all well and good so we use that

178
00:07:28,009 --> 00:07:30,080
object but we have no garbage collection

179
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,819
so we have some when we've done with it

180
00:07:31,819 --> 00:07:33,590
we actually explicitly have to say I'm

181
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:36,620
done taking away from me operating

182
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:38,719
system goes okay freeze up that piece of

183
00:07:38,719 --> 00:07:39,919
memory and then tells the rest of the

184
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:41,240
rest of the applications that you can

185
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:44,750
now write here as well so this comes

186
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:47,360
with a whole range of Poland this piece

187
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,740
of code has a subtle bug in it does

188
00:07:48,740 --> 00:08:00,669
anyone know what it is so maybe Cepeda

189
00:08:00,669 --> 00:08:08,240
said anyone though yeah so we allocate

190
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:11,330
the new array of size 42 we then till we

191
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:12,440
load through it push a bunch of stuff

192
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:15,050
onto it and then we delete the items but

193
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:17,630
this is actually leaking memory because

194
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:19,370
we are locating 42 new strings and

195
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:21,020
pushing them onto the array the array

196
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:23,479
has no idea who are in those objects it

197
00:08:23,479 --> 00:08:25,550
sort of says I know I've got memory

198
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:27,020
allocated to me but you might not have

199
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:29,360
finished with it so I can't delete it so

200
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,500
when you delete items that just simply

201
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:34,849
removes that that initial pointer so

202
00:08:34,849 --> 00:08:39,660
we've just like 42 strings

203
00:08:39,670 --> 00:08:41,980
and that's the things that C++ still

204
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:47,800
others have to deal with oops so it's

205
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:48,910
into it running backwards in time we may

206
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:50,980
as well go to the next popular language

207
00:08:50,980 --> 00:09:00,790
in around in 1995 see oh it's basically

208
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:03,790
a DSL for assembly it's a lower level as

209
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:17,290
you can get see like syntax obviously so

210
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:18,310
in JavaScript a piece of feature

211
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:19,630
detection generally look something like

212
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:23,470
their sisters from modernizer we exploit

213
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:25,060
type codes and tie portion is one of

214
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:26,410
those things that everybody uses in

215
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:27,640
every single piece of code base yet

216
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:28,930
every single person who writes a blog

217
00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:32,710
complaints about it I don't know so here

218
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:33,790
we're sort of set we're just sort of

219
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:35,770
coercing the fact that undefined becomes

220
00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:38,020
it can become a boolean and returning

221
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:41,380
that as an object but this is witchcraft

222
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:44,740
basically in the sea world see has the

223
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:46,780
concept of macros and not with good come

224
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:50,770
from Lisa macros basically is a pre pass

225
00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:52,120
of the source code before it hits the

226
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:56,440
compiler we define the token there Sarah

227
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,480
the compiler can also define a bunch of

228
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,340
tokens for you and this is what we're

229
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:01,600
going to use for feature detection in

230
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:05,860
your language so this is how it's done

231
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:09,490
now sorry about the escaping code mara

232
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:10,870
did some weird things and I couldn't fix

233
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:12,820
it I knew better to touch my slide 10

234
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:16,270
minutes before they start um so we're

235
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:17,650
creating a new element we're creating

236
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:19,840
new div and then we attach an event to

237
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:25,510
it but this isn't done at run time this

238
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:30,340
is done on build so by if it was running

239
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:33,040
on firefox firefox would see this and i

240
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:36,250
even see that which you may think looks

241
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:38,590
okay and there's no problem without it

242
00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:40,720
it's workable but it can introduce some

243
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,390
sort of bugs as well so we defined a

244
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:49,920
variable for 100 we only critical to it

245
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:52,160
and then we in the Mozilla block of code

246
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,570
because we're looking at the code we see

247
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:55,850
we'll see a variable called a then we

248
00:10:55,850 --> 00:10:57,950
look at the and someone comes along as

249
00:10:57,950 --> 00:10:59,270
well I need to I need to say let's

250
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:01,040
increase the padding on this element for

251
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,960
Mozilla so they work in another if

252
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:05,060
defined and then use a but this is now

253
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:06,890
Creek introduced the bug into our code

254
00:11:06,890 --> 00:11:08,120
because it's not actually defined for

255
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:10,100
Mozilla so we becomes a maintenance

256
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:15,980
nightmare on the object on the subject

257
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:18,230
of events obviously the web is in

258
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:20,750
invented system it's quite obvious we

259
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:22,670
click something we wait for a user

260
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:26,120
interaction we do this so if Microsoft

261
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:26,990
was creating this language they

262
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:29,150
obviously know that we need to run the

263
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:32,450
vent somehow so if you take a look

264
00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:34,370
around in 1995 and see how other

265
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:37,310
languages were doing events win32 is the

266
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:38,420
obvious thing to look out here because

267
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:40,670
it's the same sort of thing we wait for

268
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:42,050
a user interaction click a button to do

269
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:44,840
this do that so how this win for you to

270
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:48,320
do it to avoid confusing i'm going to

271
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,270
explain it how she does it natively

272
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:54,740
rather than trying to computer so this

273
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:57,260
is the stack we've got two pieces of

274
00:11:57,260 --> 00:12:01,820
data they look identical this one's a

275
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:04,190
this 165 they're exactly the same piece

276
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:06,950
of data so how is that possible using a

277
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:08,360
thing called pointers it sort of says

278
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,190
there's a piece of memory on the stack

279
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:11,840
it contains some sort of data when we

280
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,700
pull it out I want you to interpret it

281
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:15,350
as a character or in the case of the

282
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:16,700
body one I want you to interpret it as

283
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:19,760
an int so you can get to the same piece

284
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,140
of memory can return to get very

285
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:25,760
different results so pointers point to

286
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,140
an address of memory and it's up to us

287
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:29,690
to how we deal with it hard to follow

288
00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:31,130
most of the time we got to reference

289
00:12:31,130 --> 00:12:32,600
some Andy referencing other way to end

290
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,620
up dealing with the address not the

291
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:37,580
dollar ugly syntax uses the star symbol

292
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:39,920
function pointers it's the same sort of

293
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,570
thing functions are created on the stack

294
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:43,640
and all we do is we all we all we're

295
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:46,250
doing is we're going to use the the star

296
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:48,620
syntax to say there's a function that

297
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:51,140
sits here when you run execute that

298
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:53,840
function and here's a simple example in

299
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:56,570
C so we've got the main and then we've

300
00:12:56,570 --> 00:12:57,960
got results

301
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,580
the top there is how you define a

302
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:05,460
function point of the inter that embrace

303
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:07,950
a bracket start fallback star in so that

304
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:10,020
says I'm a function that takes an int

305
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:13,320
and I return an int it's that quite hard

306
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,960
to read quite hard to use and introduce

307
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:19,950
a lot of fun problems what so what if i

308
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:22,020
said if any of that went over your head

309
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:25,020
good that's kind of my point these are

310
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:26,220
the things that we as javascript

311
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:27,840
developers take for granted every single

312
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,280
day we don't have to know any of this

313
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,570
it's all taken care of us by our

314
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:33,150
interpreters so the guys at v8 and

315
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:35,070
Mozilla take care of this for us we

316
00:13:35,070 --> 00:13:36,120
don't need to know about memory

317
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,830
allocation well unless of course using

318
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:40,920
host objects in native objects inside

319
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,570
ie6 and that's a whole different kind of

320
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:51,180
worms so yeah and then so we've got

321
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:53,820
we've got a way to deal with a feature

322
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:55,050
detection forgot the way to deal with

323
00:13:55,050 --> 00:13:57,140
events where the way to create objects

324
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:59,250
but we don't have the rest of our syntax

325
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:02,610
so VB is the big beginners language we

326
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:04,110
want the web to be accessible to easy

327
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:06,720
it's a new programmer so we're still the

328
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:10,740
syntax from VV built for easy

329
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:12,150
development of goose that's what we want

330
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:15,060
very basic of your engine in which some

331
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:17,390
typing through through the dim of

332
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:21,780
keyword so this is vba it's a dialect of

333
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:25,400
the visual basic for working with frame

334
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:28,110
applications things like access excel

335
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:29,940
things like that and it looks fairly

336
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:33,660
similar to what we do day to day we

337
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:35,130
create a connection to a database or

338
00:14:35,130 --> 00:14:37,380
form a document same sort of thing we do

339
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:38,730
so it makes perfect sense at this

340
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:40,980
language we should use this language for

341
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:45,570
syntax so

342
00:14:45,570 --> 00:14:48,930
we're going to steal dim typing if-then

343
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:50,580
and anything else that's not to do with

344
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:52,820
objects or events from visual basic and

345
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:55,830
so this is what the language could have

346
00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:57,900
looked like had Microsoft developed it

347
00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:01,620
this is a fairly simple event system

348
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:03,030
that you know we write a lot in

349
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:05,130
JavaScript and look at my syntax there

350
00:15:05,130 --> 00:15:06,540
is just to create an event and it

351
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:07,350
doesn't this doesn't even have the

352
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:12,690
trigger it just simply has the adding so

353
00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:14,610
we've got no effort no hash table so we

354
00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:17,820
can't do things like we have to look

355
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:19,560
through a raise to see if there's a

356
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:23,310
unique thing they're all in all not very

357
00:15:23,310 --> 00:15:27,270
pretty so do you feel lucky yet I mean

358
00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:29,820
it could have been much worse sure

359
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:31,620
javascript isn't perfect but a lot of

360
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:33,570
the things that we do we take for

361
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:34,890
granted day today the things that we

362
00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:36,570
complain about day to day I actually

363
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:38,490
felt were fairly rare for a language of

364
00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:41,460
1995 so where is the JavaScript

365
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:42,720
community should start playing up to

366
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:46,730
this lock and just to prove a point

367
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:48,540
here's the same piece of code in

368
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:51,660
JavaScript much cleaner much easier to

369
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:57,759
read

370
00:15:57,769 --> 00:16:00,480
so to me it feels like there are already

371
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,339
people who are playing up to take

372
00:16:02,339 --> 00:16:04,980
advantage of this lock that I think we

373
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:08,670
have other than j.crew as much whatever

374
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:09,720
you feel feel about the language

375
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,730
personally you can't admit that it it

376
00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:13,589
brought a whole new world of JavaScript

377
00:16:13,589 --> 00:16:14,759
developers to the JavaScript community

378
00:16:14,759 --> 00:16:17,670
it took away what every JavaScript

379
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:19,319
developer dreaded and that was working

380
00:16:19,319 --> 00:16:21,860
with the inconsistencies in the DOM and

381
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:24,360
here's what j.crew would look like if we

382
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:26,329
had to write it in this language and

383
00:16:26,329 --> 00:16:31,290
then introduces a so this here the 13

384
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:32,819
lines of code introduces a memory leak

385
00:16:32,819 --> 00:16:35,519
we have to declare our function before

386
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:36,930
we use it even though it's a simple

387
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:38,190
one-line function we can't use an

388
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:40,860
anonymous function we have to declare

389
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:43,290
our type of funk call back before we can

390
00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:48,540
use it ugly so and then we introduce a

391
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:51,870
memory leak here because we still have a

392
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:53,940
piece of reference to the old jquery and

393
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:56,399
then we override it I wouldn't want to

394
00:16:56,399 --> 00:17:01,600
support this code

395
00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:07,740
so no Jas it's a few years old now do

396
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:09,089
you think nodejs would have been as

397
00:17:09,089 --> 00:17:10,410
popular as it was if it hadn't been

398
00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:12,240
written on JavaScript well I have the

399
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,000
answer for that nodejs is written on the

400
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,070
vented library from C called Lee BB and

401
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:18,780
here's an example of a socket server

402
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:22,170
written in li BB would you come to a

403
00:17:22,170 --> 00:17:23,880
note with you have come to a live event

404
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,920
conference about Lviv conference no

405
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:29,590
probably not because they don't exist

406
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,950
would there have been a thing like Libby

407
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:34,610
v knockout no because there isn't an

408
00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:37,500
live EV was first written in two

409
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:40,110
thousand so the JavaScript community is

410
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:42,450
hugely lucky that we have and the thing

411
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:44,280
that enables this is the fact that

412
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:46,140
JavaScript it was written the way it was

413
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:50,670
and that's the same piece of code

414
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:52,050
written in node sure there's an

415
00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:53,640
abstraction layer in between but the

416
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,810
fact that no one came up with this

417
00:17:54,810 --> 00:17:57,090
abstraction layer says something to me

418
00:17:57,090 --> 00:17:59,100
says something says that we as the

419
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:06,270
JavaScript community are very lucky so I

420
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:10,740
want you to defend JavaScript there are

421
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:13,620
things like Java developers who feel the

422
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:17,070
need to write GWT so they don't actually

423
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:19,590
have to learn JavaScript so why why do

424
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:21,210
we do things to try and avoid writing

425
00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:22,800
JavaScript we should embrace the lock

426
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:25,220
that we've been given by Brendan and

427
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:30,900
work from that this is the sister though

428
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:33,410
for animation fro from the Roman times

429
00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:36,390
it was hugely successful it devastated

430
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:38,040
most of the armies that they encountered

431
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:40,680
and as you can see they basically just

432
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,900
walked arms interlocked shield

433
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:45,950
interlocks straight up to the enemy a

434
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:49,730
well-trained unit was actually so strong

435
00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:52,410
that they could put them into a ravine

436
00:18:52,410 --> 00:18:54,270
and have horses right over the top of

437
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:56,430
them so this is what I want from the

438
00:18:56,430 --> 00:18:57,960
JavaScript community I want us to start

439
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,520
walking in the same steps walking in the

440
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,890
same direction so that we can become as

441
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:05,820
strong as this formation so how can we

442
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:08,550
do that community JavaScript as a

443
00:19:08,550 --> 00:19:11,160
community like no other I fairly active

444
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:13,040
in let us say the Python community

445
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,540
it's nothing like the JavaScript unity

446
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:16,460
I've never seen people who are so

447
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:18,560
friendly we need to keep this up so you

448
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:20,510
need to contribute to the community next

449
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:22,700
year you need to flood yawns email with

450
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:24,440
the torque submissions you need to a

451
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:27,080
flood cruces email with talk submissions

452
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:31,040
for JS conf us if you if your city has a

453
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:34,700
JavaScript user group attend speak if it

454
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:39,170
doesn't start one we started CJ us about

455
00:19:39,170 --> 00:19:40,850
a year ago now and it regularly gets

456
00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:44,450
about 150 people in and it's growing

457
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:49,190
every day so contribute to documentation

458
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:50,630
the way for new people to get involved

459
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:51,740
in the community is through

460
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:53,180
documentation contribute to things like

461
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:58,630
html5 rocks see yarn if you want to and

462
00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:00,650
mdn as well there's a doc sprint

463
00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:02,270
happening downstairs go contribute go

464
00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:03,530
harass them and ask how you can

465
00:20:03,530 --> 00:20:04,970
contribute to the documentation to make

466
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:06,800
the job to make the new people in the

467
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,960
JavaScript community welcome and avoid

468
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:15,200
w3schools how many here have you use

469
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:19,340
open source projects good everywhere

470
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:21,650
have single hand is here how many people

471
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:22,910
here have complained about an open

472
00:20:22,910 --> 00:20:25,370
source project every single hand should

473
00:20:25,370 --> 00:20:27,650
be up as well so instead of complaining

474
00:20:27,650 --> 00:20:29,210
why aren't you creating pull requests in

475
00:20:29,210 --> 00:20:32,330
github or bitbucket start by

476
00:20:32,330 --> 00:20:33,440
contributing back to open source

477
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,260
communities instead of complaining and

478
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:37,460
showing weakness in our armor we need to

479
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:39,500
stocking like you have a feature you

480
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,480
want add it yeah documentation you think

481
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:44,870
slacking fix it and join their community

482
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:48,170
jump on IRC everything every little bit

483
00:20:48,170 --> 00:20:50,990
you can but most of all I need you to go

484
00:20:50,990 --> 00:20:54,760
forward and be awesome with JavaScript

485
00:20:54,760 --> 00:21:00,799
so Who am I blah blah

486
00:21:00,809 --> 00:21:02,909
and you might be asking yourself who is

487
00:21:02,909 --> 00:21:04,139
this guy why is he standing in front of

488
00:21:04,139 --> 00:21:06,419
me telling me to go do stuff that I've

489
00:21:06,419 --> 00:21:07,950
never seen him do and you're correct

490
00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:09,450
I've been so busy with work well at

491
00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:11,460
least that's my excuse as I haven't

492
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:14,999
stepped forward and actually contribute

493
00:21:14,999 --> 00:21:16,139
to the JavaScript community with some

494
00:21:16,139 --> 00:21:20,039
bit unless you in Sydney and there's

495
00:21:20,039 --> 00:21:23,460
slides missing there it does say ballet

496
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:26,909
on one but one man so I couldn't in good

497
00:21:26,909 --> 00:21:28,470
faith stand in front of you today and

498
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:29,820
request all this from you if I wasn't

499
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:31,830
willing to stand up and step up and do

500
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:35,279
it for myself so I recently lost a fair

501
00:21:35,279 --> 00:21:36,600
bit of weight which I hope you can tell

502
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:39,210
from that image it was hard work

503
00:21:39,210 --> 00:21:42,149
I'll tell you that and I couldn't have

504
00:21:42,149 --> 00:21:44,610
done it without the pressure that my

505
00:21:44,610 --> 00:21:46,679
friends and my family put on me to keep

506
00:21:46,679 --> 00:21:50,789
it up so I'm going to stand in front of

507
00:21:50,789 --> 00:21:52,440
you today and ask for peer pressure if

508
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:54,240
it in two months you haven't seen me

509
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,799
contribute to a blog you haven't seen me

510
00:21:55,799 --> 00:21:57,720
contribute to an open source project you

511
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:58,679
haven't seen me contribute to

512
00:21:58,679 --> 00:22:00,929
documentation use those contact details

513
00:22:00,929 --> 00:22:06,119
previously and harass me harass me until

514
00:22:06,119 --> 00:22:12,400
it

515
00:22:12,410 --> 00:22:15,140
and I'm going to ask you as well that

516
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:16,970
each of you turn to the person next to

517
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:18,590
you and ask them to push you to be

518
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:21,860
awesome as well any means necessary use

519
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:24,380
a stick to beat them figure out what

520
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:26,660
projects they were working on it that

521
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:28,130
work that could be open source if

522
00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:31,190
they've been talking about fixing some

523
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:32,930
bug in an open source language that open

524
00:22:32,930 --> 00:22:36,080
source project then push them make them

525
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:39,170
do it we need to embrace the lock that

526
00:22:39,170 --> 00:22:42,470
we've been given we need to just

527
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:44,450
basically be awesome so that we as a

528
00:22:44,450 --> 00:22:46,160
JavaScript community look as strong as
