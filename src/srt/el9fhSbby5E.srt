1
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:12,040

okay Aloha my J is Koko Hana well I'm

2
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:14,320
crystal Martin I am originally from

3
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:16,770
Detroit Michigan I currently live yeah

4
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:20,200
right Marvin

5
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:23,020
I currently live in st. Louis working as

6
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:24,940
a Salesforce developer X while I'm

7
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:27,789
consulting so Ivan this Lee Louis office

8
00:00:27,789 --> 00:00:29,199
we're all over the country all over the

9
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:34,090
world and I am a proud cat mom of two so

10
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:38,110
I want to start with a story once upon a

11
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:40,360
time there was a junior deaf that was

12
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:42,640
given the task of integrating stripe

13
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,590
payments with Salesforce using

14
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:46,840
javascript and sells horses Java based

15
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:50,500
proprietary language apex some of the

16
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:53,980
questions that mr. your dad asks what is

17
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:58,719
an HTTP request what do you mean there

18
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:02,770
is no stripe library for apex what is

19
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:08,399
Ajax I thought this is what Ajax was

20
00:01:08,399 --> 00:01:11,289
like none of this made any sense to me I

21
00:01:11,289 --> 00:01:15,280
was lost and my use of confused parrot

22
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,679
here when slacking my senior colleagues

23
00:01:17,679 --> 00:01:21,550
increased immensely he's my BFF I am

24
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:25,929
confused parent we are one you see I was

25
00:01:25,929 --> 00:01:27,819
writing code on the proprietary

26
00:01:27,819 --> 00:01:29,550
Salesforce framework caught lightning

27
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:32,259
which is based on the aura framework and

28
00:01:32,259 --> 00:01:34,840
it utilizes Ajax requests for server

29
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:37,569
calls and a lot of things are taken care

30
00:01:37,569 --> 00:01:40,179
of under the hood so much like any other

31
00:01:40,179 --> 00:01:42,789
junior dev does once I got the hang of

32
00:01:42,789 --> 00:01:46,420
the pattern I knew what I had to do I go

33
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:48,130
okay I have to have a Java Script

34
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:51,429
controller and it calls helper functions

35
00:01:51,429 --> 00:01:52,959
and another jobs could control there and

36
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:55,030
then it somehow calls my server call to

37
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:57,190
get David so sure my user okay great

38
00:01:57,190 --> 00:02:00,209
why is he this working and I kept saying

39
00:02:00,209 --> 00:02:04,300
my logic is correct the way in which I

40
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:06,819
made the request was correct the logic I

41
00:02:06,819 --> 00:02:08,560
had to process the request was the

42
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,500
response that I got was right but there

43
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,659
was a fundamental misunderstanding I was

44
00:02:13,659 --> 00:02:16,480
having I was trying to act on data that

45
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,290
I hadn't even got

46
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:20,409
back yet and I was assuming things were

47
00:02:20,409 --> 00:02:22,900
happening in order but I don't

48
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:24,670
understand it at the time and when my

49
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:26,200
colleague looked at what I was trying to

50
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:29,409
do he goes it doesn't work that way and

51
00:02:29,409 --> 00:02:34,090
I go wah and he says because javascript

52
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:36,180
is asynchronous

53
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:41,700
what okay yeah okay

54
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:44,349
javascript is a secret what like what

55
00:02:44,349 --> 00:02:46,719
does that mean I mean I know what

56
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:48,519
synchronous and asynchronous mean as

57
00:02:48,519 --> 00:02:51,430
words like dictionary words but like I

58
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:53,409
had no idea but this meant when it came

59
00:02:53,409 --> 00:02:56,620
to programming no idea now let me just

60
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:58,629
stop here we're not gonna get into this

61
00:02:58,629 --> 00:02:59,139
nerds

62
00:02:59,139 --> 00:03:02,049
listen yes javascript is asynchronous

63
00:03:02,049 --> 00:03:04,209
right I know the JavaScript isn't any

64
00:03:04,209 --> 00:03:06,129
synchronous language but it has

65
00:03:06,129 --> 00:03:08,769
capabilities that allow it to to have

66
00:03:08,769 --> 00:03:10,359
asynchronous behavior but just roll with

67
00:03:10,359 --> 00:03:12,209
it oh okay

68
00:03:12,209 --> 00:03:16,060
you see part of the problem here is how

69
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:19,540
many self-taught coders learn online we

70
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:21,639
learn JavaScript like it always runs

71
00:03:21,639 --> 00:03:25,030
line by line one thing at a time and we

72
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:27,400
get taught to solve puzzles rather than

73
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,769
solve problems with the tool that we're

74
00:03:29,769 --> 00:03:32,340
using in the context of its intended use

75
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:35,650
so sure I need to know what else what if

76
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:37,840
else's are and I need to know what for

77
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,970
loops are but they really discuss why

78
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:42,549
javascript is the way it is what does it

79
00:03:42,549 --> 00:03:46,959
enable a developer to actually do so you

80
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:48,340
know starting out this isn't super

81
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:50,500
apparent to a junior devs we don't know

82
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,599
about asynchronous Nissen till we're

83
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:54,579
dumped in a coding job and have to write

84
00:03:54,579 --> 00:03:57,449
JavaScript for I don't know the web and

85
00:03:57,449 --> 00:03:59,620
then we're like where am I like

86
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:01,510
for loops and count that I need to count

87
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:05,590
like I've lost so you know you're

88
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:06,430
probably thinking why you're talking

89
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:08,319
about all this but I want this talk to

90
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:10,689
do two things one I want it to be

91
00:04:10,689 --> 00:04:11,889
something that can be helpful for new

92
00:04:11,889 --> 00:04:14,379
depths to understand JavaScript a bit

93
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:16,329
better and to show an overview over

94
00:04:16,329 --> 00:04:17,620
different ways that you can do

95
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:19,419
asynchronous programming with JavaScript

96
00:04:19,419 --> 00:04:21,459
and I want it I basically wrote this

97
00:04:21,459 --> 00:04:22,509
talk because I wanted to break it down

98
00:04:22,509 --> 00:04:24,880
for myself I was using something that I

99
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,849
had no idea what was happening in to our

100
00:04:27,849 --> 00:04:30,169
mid-career and senior developers and the

101
00:04:30,169 --> 00:04:32,090
to remember that most of the time we

102
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:33,770
don't get topless stuff if you don't

103
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:35,629
didn't get a siesta career even if you

104
00:04:35,629 --> 00:04:38,689
did and it's kind of confusing and it's

105
00:04:38,689 --> 00:04:40,550
possible you take your understanding of

106
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:42,740
this for granted so my hope is that this

107
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:44,990
talk will give you some intuition onto

108
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:46,580
how to help someone better understand

109
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:49,009
this so let's get into it but before we

110
00:04:49,009 --> 00:04:50,689
can talk about what asynchronous means

111
00:04:50,689 --> 00:04:57,390
let's talk about what synchronous means

112
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:00,139
so essentially it means that things

113
00:05:00,139 --> 00:05:03,020
happen in order right synchronously one

114
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:05,870
thing after another step-by-step but

115
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:08,240
sometimes you need to make a call out to

116
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,849
request data from an external system and

117
00:05:10,849 --> 00:05:12,439
because those things take time

118
00:05:12,439 --> 00:05:14,330
it can hold up processing of other

119
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:15,860
actions that are independent of that

120
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:18,650
data that you need so if you wait for it

121
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:20,120
to come back before you go on to the

122
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,289
next step in your part of your process

123
00:05:21,289 --> 00:05:24,159
you're wasting precious resources and

124
00:05:24,159 --> 00:05:26,300
that can't be used to do something else

125
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:30,430
it's kind of like doing household chores

126
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:32,930
say you need to clean up your house and

127
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:36,199
do laundry so usually I put a load of

128
00:05:36,199 --> 00:05:38,629
clothes in before I start cleaning to

129
00:05:38,629 --> 00:05:40,819
get that process going I don't know

130
00:05:40,819 --> 00:05:43,370
about you and if you're doing chores in

131
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:45,800
a totally synchronous way this will

132
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:49,460
require us to put our dirty clothes in

133
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:52,159
the washer and then proceed to stand

134
00:05:52,159 --> 00:05:53,810
there for thirty minutes as they wash

135
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:57,740
rinse and spin before we can put them in

136
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:59,569
the dryer for the next part of the

137
00:05:59,569 --> 00:06:00,969
process

138
00:06:00,969 --> 00:06:05,990
two hours later you're still standing

139
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:08,629
there the Sun is going down and in the

140
00:06:08,629 --> 00:06:10,219
meantime I can't get anything else done

141
00:06:10,219 --> 00:06:12,589
I can't move on to clean the bathroom or

142
00:06:12,589 --> 00:06:14,960
load the dishwasher which leads us to a

143
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,680
conversation on asynchronous programming

144
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,060
so what is it it means things are

145
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:26,240
happening at different times not in sync

146
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:28,110
process and the rest of the code doesn't

147
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:30,570
stop if there's a process that requires

148
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:33,540
time so we just go along doing our own

149
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:35,190
thing and in this case if you the rest

150
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:37,320
of our chores and when there's an

151
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:40,080
indication that our sequence process has

152
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,300
completed we'll go on to the next step

153
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:44,730
relate it to that so you don't need to

154
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:46,860
you do have to wait for your clothes to

155
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:48,810
dry before you can fold them unless

156
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:51,630
you're weird but you don't need to stand

157
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:53,550
there and wait for them to get other

158
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:56,820
 done and why don't we use

159
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:58,710
done and why don't we use
JavaScript for this well JavaScript was

160
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:00,600
written to deal with user and user

161
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:03,120
interactions in real time in the browser

162
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,790
so users don't use the web in a

163
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:07,260
synchronous way which is something I

164
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,670
would have liked kind of like to learn

165
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:11,400
about your interacting over a network

166
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,720
connection pulling data from external

167
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,960
sources which just takes time and

168
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:18,740
JavaScript was created to actually

169
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:21,419
ensure seamless experiences for users on

170
00:07:21,419 --> 00:07:23,880
the web so let's continue our

171
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,200
conversation about asynchronous

172
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:28,200
programming with JavaScript with a fun

173
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,460
example that will help you learn

174
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:31,700
something new about two things

175
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:35,130
javascript and the natural haircare

176
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:39,730
process

177
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:42,210
black robe magic for you and Black

178
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:46,919
History Month okay let's go so Naturals

179
00:07:46,919 --> 00:07:50,040
had this little thing called wash day

180
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:53,510
hashtag wash man hear you I hear you yes

181
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:56,940
and so clearly does meme is a joke but

182
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:59,280
it isn't too far from the truth yes

183
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,590
sometimes I need the Holy Bible to help

184
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:05,340
me with this process but it's not far

185
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:06,750
away from what a lot of naturals

186
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:09,360
experience and generally I do this on a

187
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,800
weekend day where I have some other

188
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,419
chores as well so I can kind of

189
00:08:12,419 --> 00:08:15,660
multitask so if you don't know about the

190
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:16,860
natural hair process okay you're gonna

191
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:19,680
learn it's fine just roll with it so

192
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,080
this is my do hair function and just you

193
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,400
know this stuff is pseudocode it so

194
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,290
don't get all judgy JavaScript

195
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:30,060
developers but here's here's my main

196
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:31,560
process this is not do hair functions

197
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,870
I'm gonna walk you through it so first I

198
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:36,060
have to do something called a pre-poo

199
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:37,590
treatment what is that

200
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:40,260
poof well sometimes I have my hair and

201
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:41,909
like protective styles like this braids

202
00:08:41,909 --> 00:08:44,340
right or I have afro and it stays like

203
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:45,870
that so I'm not calming my hair every

204
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:48,270
day so I have to put some conditioner

205
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:51,120
and oil in my hair first and let it fit

206
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,610
so my hair can get soft and then I can

207
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:55,890
go on to detangling right cuz I get

208
00:08:55,890 --> 00:08:57,420
softer and I can get those shed hair and

209
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:59,970
I can detangle it and then I'll go ahead

210
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:02,190
and shampoo my hair rinse that stuff out

211
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:04,080
and then I have to do conditioner

212
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,190
because I have to you know put the

213
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:07,529
moisture back in let that sit for a

214
00:09:07,529 --> 00:09:11,010
while rinse it out and then air dry it

215
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:13,170
air drying also takes time and then I'll

216
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:15,830
restart I would turn my styled hair and

217
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:18,360
this is what my Saturday generally looks

218
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,740
like so I have my chores here I usually

219
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:23,010
do my hair do laundry clean litter boxes

220
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:25,230
clean the kitchen clean the bathroom so

221
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:28,410
if I did this synchronously in order it

222
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:30,210
would take a long time look at this this

223
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:31,800
is what my day would look like right I'd

224
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:34,380
have my do here function here and I'd

225
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:36,540
have to go through all that before I

226
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:38,070
actually got to anything else in my do

227
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:40,560
chores function and I'm gonna go into

228
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,990
detail so again pre-poo treatment

229
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:45,000
requires me to put conditioner oil on my

230
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,550
hair and do what wait right so I have to

231
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:49,650
let it sit before I go on to detangle so

232
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:51,750
I'm waiting and then I have another

233
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:53,490
asynchronous process and then do here

234
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:55,680
again right I have to deep condition my

235
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:59,910
hair let it sit wait and then I have to

236
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:02,040
go ahead and do another you synchronous

237
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,930
process which is air drying my hair and

238
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:06,420
I have to wait and it takes even more

239
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:08,040
time so looking at the do chores

240
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,110
function again here I have three

241
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:12,330
asynchronous processes and it would take

242
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:15,180
forever before I started doing anything

243
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:15,690
else

244
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:17,400
cleaning the lot you know clean the

245
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,310
litter boxes doing laundry any of that

246
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:22,050
so there's got to be a better way to do

247
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:24,420
this right and there is thanks

248
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:27,900
JavaScript let's do it asynchronously

249
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:33,089
with callbacks so what is a car back a

250
00:10:33,089 --> 00:10:35,220
callback is a function that is passed as

251
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:37,440
an argument to an asynchronous function

252
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,089
ie a function it takes a while to

253
00:10:39,089 --> 00:10:41,790
complete some time and it's called once

254
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:44,130
the asynchronous side takes it's called

255
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:46,110
sir it's called once the ace even is

256
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:47,130
function completes

257
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:49,640
so to give you a little example here

258
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:51,420
this is

259
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:54,120
that function if I take a scared Kitty

260
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,910
to the vet I need to comfort it when it

261
00:10:56,910 --> 00:11:00,990
comes back and so I have an asynchronous

262
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:03,240
function here called take cat to vet

263
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,980
where the kitty gets his temperature

264
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:07,320
taken gets a shot and then it's brought

265
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:09,630
back home this is the asynchronous

266
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:11,640
function that takes a call back as an

267
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:15,120
argument so as you see here the call

268
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,300
back function gets passed by reference

269
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:20,820
to take cat to vet so the front and

270
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:22,620
Kitty get some TLC after visiting the

271
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:27,410
big bag vet Viktor happy kitty

272
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:29,790
so let's look all bags and the do hare

273
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:31,050
function so to remind you the process

274
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:32,610
here we're going to look at pre food

275
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:33,570
treatments this is our first

276
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:35,160
asynchronous function and it kicks off

277
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:38,730
the do hair function so this is pre-poo

278
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:40,920
without a callback this is what I do

279
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:43,140
here so the function would just sit here

280
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:45,420
while pre-poo was was finishing right

281
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:48,000
and this function will be considered a

282
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,010
blocking operation you know you can't go

283
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:51,600
on and do anything else in the do hair

284
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,610
function but I also can't do anything

285
00:11:53,610 --> 00:11:57,450
else in my overall chores function so I

286
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:59,100
have to I'm going to go ahead and

287
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:01,590
rewrite this as a callback that way we

288
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:09,630
don't get stuck here I'm sorry so I have

289
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:10,500
I have it

290
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:13,170
taking the callback let's look at it so

291
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:15,300
sorry I have this function here as we've

292
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:17,340
written as a function that takes a

293
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:18,990
callback and we'll look at it in more

294
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:22,410
detail from this point so here is my

295
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:25,620
pre-poo function declaration it

296
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:27,960
indicates that I am going to have a

297
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:32,580
function that takes a callback and so

298
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:34,230
this was my pre food treatment does

299
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:35,610
right misses the function does I put

300
00:12:35,610 --> 00:12:39,300
conditioner oil my hair and I wait and I

301
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,620
come upon completion of the

302
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:42,270
aforementioned process of putting the

303
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:44,130
conditioner oil in my hair I will cause

304
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:46,020
that timeout which is a method that will

305
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:47,940
call a function which in this case is

306
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:53,310
our call back after a waiting period and

307
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:54,330
now I'm going to go ahead and actually

308
00:12:54,330 --> 00:12:57,090
call the people treatment but I'm going

309
00:12:57,090 --> 00:12:58,650
to go ahead and pass in my function

310
00:12:58,650 --> 00:13:00,810
which in this case is an anonymous

311
00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:02,790
function that contains the rest of the

312
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:03,220
natural

313
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:05,439
process and I've abbreviated it here but

314
00:13:05,439 --> 00:13:06,910
you can see that just for clarity's sake

315
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:09,970
that's what we passed in now you can

316
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:11,319
also instantiate the callback function

317
00:13:11,319 --> 00:13:13,870
and set it equal to a variable and

318
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:15,519
pacify reference but you'll see this

319
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:18,490
done both ways so this looks pretty good

320
00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:21,550
but you know what I need to add error

321
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:25,000
handling you know sometimes my hair just

322
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,250
isn't quite soft enough yet you know I

323
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:28,720
put it in there - still flunk out of

324
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,209
tough so if I started detangling my

325
00:13:31,209 --> 00:13:34,779
curly fragile strands it would not be

326
00:13:34,779 --> 00:13:36,639
good so I have to add some arrogantly

327
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:38,529
here so it's not soft enough I'm gonna

328
00:13:38,529 --> 00:13:40,209
go ahead and not do anything right

329
00:13:40,209 --> 00:13:42,100
otherwise if it's okay I'm going to go

330
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:43,720
ahead and go on to the next step of

331
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:48,459
detangling and shampooing oh but you

332
00:13:48,459 --> 00:13:50,079
know what else I have some other

333
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:51,610
asynchronous processes in here right I

334
00:13:51,610 --> 00:13:54,009
have to dis Hangul and shampoo which

335
00:13:54,009 --> 00:13:56,290
happened back-to-back but deep

336
00:13:56,290 --> 00:13:57,819
conditioning takes time right I have to

337
00:13:57,819 --> 00:13:59,350
wait for that one to let have to let it

338
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:03,639
sit and you know what I heard Ryan takes

339
00:14:03,639 --> 00:14:06,670
time too so now I have a function that

340
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:08,350
takes callbacks with functions that take

341
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:12,040
callbacks and this is what the doTERRA

342
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:14,230
function ends up looking like right now

343
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:16,329
partially this is great because I have

344
00:14:16,329 --> 00:14:19,209
this asynchronous behavior right that

345
00:14:19,209 --> 00:14:21,009
allows me to go on and continue doing

346
00:14:21,009 --> 00:14:23,410
other things while I you know wait for

347
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:27,220
my hair to be done but this target part

348
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:29,079
to read right and what if there was

349
00:14:29,079 --> 00:14:30,490
another fellow like natural these

350
00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:31,809
wouldn't want to embrace our curls and

351
00:14:31,809 --> 00:14:34,269
follow my process this will get really

352
00:14:34,269 --> 00:14:36,189
really confusing to look at and this is

353
00:14:36,189 --> 00:14:39,129
what developers call callback hell it's

354
00:14:39,129 --> 00:14:40,389
kind of confusing to figure out what's

355
00:14:40,389 --> 00:14:42,009
happening here you know it makes

356
00:14:42,009 --> 00:14:44,620
tracking down bugs difficult and what if

357
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:46,269
I added more asynchronous processes

358
00:14:46,269 --> 00:14:48,490
y'all believe it or not I'm going gray

359
00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:51,220
at the age of 31 so sometimes I have to

360
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:53,709
put color in my hair and let that

361
00:14:53,709 --> 00:14:56,439
sit right you know and then sometimes I

362
00:14:56,439 --> 00:14:58,180
have to like I have to do a clarifying

363
00:14:58,180 --> 00:14:59,410
tree because I have to put some of the

364
00:14:59,410 --> 00:15:00,939
stuff in my hair so that's another

365
00:15:00,939 --> 00:15:02,980
asynchronous function or process that I

366
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:04,269
would have to put in this do hair

367
00:15:04,269 --> 00:15:06,279
function like this would get confusing

368
00:15:06,279 --> 00:15:08,889
after a while so this functionality is

369
00:15:08,889 --> 00:15:11,500
great but the readability is not so

370
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:14,410
great but there is a way you can rewrite

371
00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:15,670
asynchronous code

372
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:17,100
so that it looks some more synchronous

373
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:20,080
making it easier to follow and that can

374
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:27,850
be done by using promises ah promises so

375
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:30,400
useful yet so difficult to understand

376
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,510
what you're starting out but I'm gonna

377
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:34,450
try to break it down sorrell with me so

378
00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:36,400
what is a promise a promise is a

379
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:38,380
JavaScript object that will produce a

380
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:41,040
value at some point in the future

381
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:44,290
promises basically promise that they'll

382
00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:45,580
let you know what happened right either

383
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:48,790
it was fulfilled reject it or pending

384
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:51,850
and it allows you to act on other your

385
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:53,950
results with other methods and then I

386
00:15:53,950 --> 00:15:56,620
have a promise object here and this has

387
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:59,800
two internal state and result properties

388
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:02,980
and two method properties resolve and

389
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:05,050
reject which will call about a minute

390
00:16:05,050 --> 00:16:08,470
and then I have dot VIN and dot catch

391
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:10,780
which are handlers for the asynchronous

392
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:13,210
calls result so it waits for a Stephan

393
00:16:13,210 --> 00:16:15,070
is code to complete to then go on to the

394
00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:18,130
next process and dot then takes two

395
00:16:18,130 --> 00:16:22,900
methods as arguments one the first

396
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:24,130
function is what happens when everything

397
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:27,190
goes well and the other one is what's

398
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:28,660
good cause when this doesn't go well and

399
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:32,800
that catch handles errors so let's look

400
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,320
at the process and anatomy with a pizza

401
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:37,750
promise so here I have a pizza promise

402
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:39,520
I'm sure you'd all like to have a pizza

403
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:42,580
promise Valentine's Day is coming up

404
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:45,850
these Frances the so the promises object

405
00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:47,920
of promise object constructor has a

406
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:50,110
function that takes the resolve and

407
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:53,590
reject methods as parameters and then

408
00:16:53,590 --> 00:16:55,420
there's an executing cold that will

409
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:57,130
return some kind of result and so in

410
00:16:57,130 --> 00:17:00,520
this case it's big pizza right so we

411
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,780
have big pizza that's our executing

412
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:05,380
close gonna do something and you know

413
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:07,930
what baked pizza returns will either

414
00:17:07,930 --> 00:17:12,700
reject or resolve this promise so here

415
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:15,040
if there's an error and say the pizza

416
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:17,080
got burnt I'm gonna go ahead and reject

417
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:21,550
with pizza era sabar pizza otherwise

418
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:23,890
everything's great this pizza is perfect

419
00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:25,930
I'm gonna resolve with the perfect pizza

420
00:17:25,930 --> 00:17:28,770
and so now

421
00:17:28,770 --> 00:17:30,600
I can look at this and I'm going to go

422
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:33,539
ahead and now I have a flow piece of

423
00:17:33,539 --> 00:17:34,890
promise here and I'm gonna go ahead and

424
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:37,529
call it or call it kids promise with

425
00:17:37,529 --> 00:17:41,909
that then and again my first function in

426
00:17:41,909 --> 00:17:42,750
there is what's going to happen

427
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:44,220
everything goes well so if I have a

428
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:45,929
perfect pizza I'm gonna go ahead and eat

429
00:17:45,929 --> 00:17:50,130
that pizza or if it's burnt it's trash

430
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:51,480
I'm gonna go ahead and throw away that

431
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:57,029
pizza promises so we can rewrite pre-poo

432
00:17:57,029 --> 00:17:59,789
the function paper as a function that

433
00:17:59,789 --> 00:18:01,470
returns a promise and this enables us to

434
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:04,830
go ahead and call other things on it so

435
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:07,679
here I have pre pretreatment equal to a

436
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:09,990
function of anonymous function takes

437
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:12,149
here it returns a promise if

438
00:18:12,149 --> 00:18:13,679
everything's okay I'm sorry everything

439
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:15,390
goes wrong I'm gonna go ahead and reject

440
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:17,700
with an error huh that's awesome I can't

441
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:20,250
drive into it otherwise it's okay I'm

442
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:22,440
gonna go ahead and detangle it Shampoo

443
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,210
it and then resolve this promise with

444
00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:26,010
shampooed hair so I can go on to the

445
00:18:26,010 --> 00:18:30,240
next step and know I could have do hair

446
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,460
return a promise and this allows us to

447
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:35,480
change our promises with dot bins a

448
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,590
point completion of an asynchronous

449
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:40,049
functions processing we can go on to the

450
00:18:40,049 --> 00:18:42,600
next step that returns a promise which

451
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,220
means that we can do another that then

452
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:46,919
and complete another step in the process

453
00:18:46,919 --> 00:18:50,789
and also notice that that things come

454
00:18:50,789 --> 00:18:52,350
after the return of an asynchronous

455
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:55,590
function so this also means that we can

456
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:57,179
handle errors in one place

457
00:18:57,179 --> 00:18:58,470
which allows us to remove all those it

458
00:18:58,470 --> 00:18:59,880
else as we had in our callback channel

459
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,529
and clean up our code with that dot

460
00:19:01,529 --> 00:19:05,250
catch hair then dot then go out on the

461
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:08,610
town oh and here's a side-by-side

462
00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:09,750
comparison

463
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:12,000
and so now it's much easier to read you

464
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,370
know no more pyramid of do whom just say

465
00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:16,140
synchronous Kol their reads

466
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:19,980
synchronously but this can be improved

467
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:28,550
even more with a sync awaked oh my god

468
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:31,660
so this is kind of cool if you put the

469
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:33,820
async keyword in front of a function it

470
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:35,380
automatically makes it a function that

471
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:36,520
returns a promise

472
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:39,160
and if executing code returns a non

473
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:41,230
promise value it'll just wrap it in a

474
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:43,990
promise and a wait mix jeaious wait

475
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:46,060
until the promise is settled and then

476
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:47,620
returns the result and this only works

477
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:49,510
with async function so faction but that

478
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:51,880
keyword just the disclaimer here like

479
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:53,620
this is a newer feature of JavaScript so

480
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:55,930
you might have to figure out how to make

481
00:19:55,930 --> 00:19:57,190
it compatible browsers and all that

482
00:19:57,190 --> 00:19:59,650
stuff but it is a cool new way to handle

483
00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:06,880
asynchronous behavior and so now I can

484
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,000
go ahead and rewrite my do here function

485
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,470
with an async in front and then wherever

486
00:20:11,470 --> 00:20:13,060
I have an asynchronous process I just

487
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:15,190
put in a weight there the function Waits

488
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:16,690
and it allows me to go onto other things

489
00:20:16,690 --> 00:20:20,190
in my chore chart Detroit's function and

490
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:23,560
so looking at this you can see all three

491
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:25,420
approaches here now these are all

492
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:27,460
correct ways for handling asynchronous

493
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:30,850
behavior but as you can see it gets

494
00:20:30,850 --> 00:20:32,620
progressively easier to see what is

495
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:38,230
happening in the code look at this looks

496
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:40,810
so nice and easy to follow someone that

497
00:20:40,810 --> 00:20:42,430
didn't know JavaScript could probably

498
00:20:42,430 --> 00:20:44,590
guess what's happening here so now I

499
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:45,970
might do here function is rewritten with

500
00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:48,550
async await I can go ahead and call the

501
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:50,170
chores and everything works - maybe

502
00:20:50,170 --> 00:20:52,390
expensive we can start my hair go do

503
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:54,070
something else come back to another step

504
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:55,720
to something else come back to another

505
00:20:55,720 --> 00:21:01,470
step and now I have officially

506
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:06,790
officially finished my arm my chores and

507
00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:17,290
my hair and not only do you know now how

508
00:21:17,290 --> 00:21:20,830
to slay natural hair but you can also

509
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:22,300
display a sleeping this program with

510
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:27,280
JavaScript real watch so in closing I

511
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:30,010
just want to say being a junior dev is

512
00:21:30,010 --> 00:21:32,230
no joke it is not for the faint of heart

513
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:34,750
and if you're feeling like a dummy it's

514
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:36,580
okay you're a you were dummy and if so

515
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:39,400
is everyone else you work with

516
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,740
but seriously all jokes aside this is

517
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:43,120
what it's exciting about being and

518
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,620
programming right like everyone is

519
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:46,270
trying to just figure things out we

520
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:47,559
don't always have the answers we're

521
00:21:47,559 --> 00:21:50,740
always learning everyday and if you're a

522
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:52,720
senior dev training a team or someone

523
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:53,910
that's new to development may be

524
00:21:53,910 --> 00:21:56,380
non-traditional background like myself I

525
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:58,540
was in education and non practice before

526
00:21:58,540 --> 00:22:00,910
I came to tech again just know this

527
00:22:00,910 --> 00:22:02,950
stuff isn't always apparent try to

528
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:04,360
remember where you were here when you

529
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:06,820
were here have some empathy you know and

530
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:08,500
share your knowledge you know what they

531
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:11,380
say those who can teach and those who

532
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:12,670
can't just sit in the corner and call by

533
00:22:12,670 --> 00:22:16,210
themselves and if you create tech

534
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:17,950
training materials think about how you

535
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:19,960
can represent all the diverse people in

536
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:22,540
this field that make up tech originally

537
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:24,130
I was gonna write this whole talk with

538
00:22:24,130 --> 00:22:26,080
laundry as my main example that is

539
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:29,230
boring and I started having flashbacks

540
00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:31,480
to my days watching online tutorials

541
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:33,070
looking at stupid ass examples about

542
00:22:33,070 --> 00:22:35,500
torpedoes and like counting cattle for

543
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:37,179
real some of y'all know what class I'm

544
00:22:37,179 --> 00:22:40,480
talking about and it was just so

545
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,790
irritating to me that there were no

546
00:22:41,790 --> 00:22:44,710
examples like none of the materials were

547
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:45,880
anything like anything that I had

548
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:48,160
personally experienced and frankly

549
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,480
sometimes it just made it hard for me to

550
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:50,800
understand the content that I was

551
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,750
supposed to be learning so it's

552
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:54,460

553
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:56,170
