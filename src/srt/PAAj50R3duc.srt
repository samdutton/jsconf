00:00:07,639 --> 00:00:10,800

good my name is Francisco tomas key I am

2
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,540
a co-founder of a company called 280

3
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:14,370
north I founded that with two of my best

4
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:16,379
friends from college who are also here

5
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:17,910
at jay's comp so if you have any

6
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:20,279
questions you can hit any one of us

7
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:22,080
we're probably going to be wearing 20

8
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:26,010
North's shirts so what I'm here to talk

9
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:29,160
about today is a JavaScript framework we

10
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,969
created called cappuccino just out of

11
00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:35,040
curiosity how many of you have heard of

12
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,480
it just so i know whether i should focus

13
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:40,680
on okay okay good so something we like

14
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:43,079
to say a lot and we always try to start

15
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:44,610
our presentations this way is by

16
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:46,230
describing exactly what it's for and

17
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:48,899
what it's not for cappuccino is for what

18
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:51,120
we call desktop-class applications and

19
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,670
by that we mean kind of the applications

20
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:55,559
that you used to expect running on the

21
00:00:55,559 --> 00:00:57,239
desktop and a lot of people thought

22
00:00:57,239 --> 00:00:59,129
would never make it to the web but are

23
00:00:59,129 --> 00:01:01,379
more and more going there today so you

24
00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:03,690
know we like to think of the web as this

25
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:05,640
giant spectrum right and when the web

26
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:08,280
first started it was had this kind of

27
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,020
web page in mind you know the

28
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:11,970
traditional restful web something like

29
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:13,770
New York Times just a bunch of pages

30
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:16,200
connected by hyperlinks and then over

31
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,330
time they got a little more dynamic

32
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:20,909
things like amazon com now amazon com

33
00:01:20,909 --> 00:01:23,670
still fits this original vision of the

34
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:25,770
web really well but you can't deny that

35
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:27,600
it's not an application right you can

36
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:28,920
you can put your credit card number and

37
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,170
there thus it's an application so it

38
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:33,380
does things as well as present things

39
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:35,670
then you have things like Facebook which

40
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:39,060
are like exactly in the middle they are

41
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:41,460
very restful right every single user has

42
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:42,960
their own page and you know that pages

43
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,149
and change and everything but on the

44
00:01:45,149 --> 00:01:47,250
other hand every single page can have

45
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:49,920
like 30 different apps running on it so

46
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,479
this is like something that's very

47
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:54,149
unique to the web and then on the far

48
00:01:54,149 --> 00:01:56,369
right of the spectrum you have things

49
00:01:56,369 --> 00:01:58,229
like Google Maps and Google Maps is

50
00:01:58,229 --> 00:01:59,820
actually a really great example of this

51
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:02,040
kind of app because Microsoft actually

52
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,630
originally argued against the web

53
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:05,969
platform by saying they'll never be able

54
00:02:05,969 --> 00:02:08,550
to do something like Maps well they were

55
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:11,280
wrong and this kind of kicked off the

56
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,670
revolution of doing

57
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:14,440
incredibly dynamic things things you'd

58
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:16,780
only expect on the desktop before on the

59
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:21,370
web so we really wanted to build this

60
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:24,280
kind of application on the web like

61
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:28,030
three years ago or something something

62
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:30,940
like that and the problem was that the

63
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:33,190
tools for doing it even though the web

64
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:35,170
was capable of doing it the tools

65
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:37,569
weren't really there to do it and it's

66
00:02:37,569 --> 00:02:40,269
not because the tools were bad it's that

67
00:02:40,269 --> 00:02:41,440
the tools focused on different things

68
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,390
right the tools were really you know

69
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:44,860
optimized for building things like new

70
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:47,530
york times or amazon.com that sort of

71
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:49,660
thing you know just when Google Maps

72
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:51,250
first came out no one had already made a

73
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:54,340
framework for it for anything so we

74
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:55,989
wanted to make a framework that really

75
00:02:55,989 --> 00:02:57,580
targeted this right hand of the spectrum

76
00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:00,130
what we call desktop-class applications

77
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:01,870
and you can really tell that this is

78
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:03,400
necessary because if you go hit view

79
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,290
source on any one of these applications

80
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:06,370
you know one of the great things of the

81
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:08,140
web you'll see that all of them have

82
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:10,690
basically done each other's job over and

83
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:13,060
over again right meebo is a great

84
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:15,670
example you know they me bows I use that

85
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:17,890
instead of ichat a lot and it's a really

86
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:20,290
great web app yet they have to put so

87
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:22,810
many resources into drawing windows and

88
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:24,910
drawing buttons and basically putting

89
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:27,280
together a windowing system and it

90
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,010
really sucks that for a chat application

91
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:32,680
there you know strategic advantage to be

92
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,810
we hired 20 people to write a windowing

93
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:36,310
system that that's not what the web

94
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:37,780
should be right that should be a solved

95
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:39,430
problem and you should be able to focus

96
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:42,940
on what makes your application unique so

97
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:44,530
I want to give you an example of the

98
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:46,510
first step we wrote using this framework

99
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:49,420
it's called 280 slides and I will go

100
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:57,250
ahead and do that right now

101
00:03:57,260 --> 00:04:01,360
go

102
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:03,170
so this is Twitty slides it's kind of

103
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:04,879
like keynote or powerpoint on the web

104
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:06,590
and it's running in Safari and you can

105
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:09,860
of course do you expect to be able to do

106
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:12,140
you know kind of make a title and set

107
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:14,060
the font or whatever but again we really

108
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:16,579
wanted that desktop feel so we really

109
00:04:16,579 --> 00:04:18,019
tried to get media right so you know

110
00:04:18,019 --> 00:04:19,639
we've got shapes and you can do whatever

111
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:21,019
you want with them and this will work in

112
00:04:21,019 --> 00:04:23,660
you know IE or firefox or whatever and

113
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:25,430
we don't stop there you know we let you

114
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:27,590
do any arbitrary media so you can do a

115
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:29,330
search for an image on google images you

116
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:31,520
can drag that in you know this is just

117
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,780
going to work it's going to be fast and

118
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:34,940
of course just like on the desktop all

119
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:36,550
your key bindings should work right so

120
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:38,510
copy paste should work and that

121
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:40,010
shouldn't be just bound to text or

122
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:41,660
images I should be able to do it you

123
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:44,000
know on slide level if I move things

124
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,910
around undo should just work so all this

125
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:48,199
and you can undo all the way to the

126
00:04:48,199 --> 00:04:50,960
beginning of your document etc and of

127
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,190
course you can do this with movies as

128
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:59,360
well so I'm do a quick search here so

129
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,530
when you can quick look this just like

130
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:05,490
on Mac OS 10 and it's letting up YouTube

131
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:09,320
there we go so he can kind of preview

132
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:11,030
your movie for you see it you guys

133
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:12,470
believe me that this is a real movie not

134
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:14,979
an animated gif friend I can close this

135
00:05:14,979 --> 00:05:17,240
so then you can drag it on and if you

136
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:19,460
want so so that's kind of the idea we

137
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:20,720
wanted something that really felt like a

138
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,789
real application and I want to show you

139
00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:24,320
one more application this one was just

140
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,240
released a couple days ago not by us

141
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,250
it's called mockingbird it's kind of

142
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:29,930
like balsamic have you guys played

143
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:31,910
around with balsamic at all so but it's

144
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:33,229
written completely with web standards

145
00:05:33,229 --> 00:05:34,820
technologies on top of cappuccino and

146
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:36,800
it's kind of the same thing you can you

147
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,010
know lay out a UI and if you want to

148
00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:41,720
link to another page you can just hear

149
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,160
you have your different pages you can

150
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:45,349
just kind of drag in the other page and

151
00:05:45,349 --> 00:05:49,039
now it's linked to it there you go so

152
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:50,120
you guys should just play around with

153
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:58,220
this I'm go Mockingbird calm we go so

154
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:01,039
the way we decided to build this is by

155
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:02,840
taking an existing technology that we

156
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,550
thought already worked really well and

157
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:06,169
we're all former Mac guys and we used to

158
00:06:06,169 --> 00:06:09,020
write mac software and Coco is the way

159
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:10,820
you write applications on the mac and we

160
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:12,100
really like it

161
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:13,150
you know it's a really great framework

162
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:14,800
for doing very visual you I driven

163
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,760
things and what really sealed the deal

164
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,560
for us was the fact that Coco has been

165
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,200
around for like 20 years like next step

166
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,850
was running this then Mac started

167
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:27,640
running it and a few years ago they took

168
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:29,140
this existing framework and shoved it

169
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:30,400
into a completely different environment

170
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,580
the iphone and if you look at iphone

171
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:35,680
apps they look pretty darn good so that

172
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,750
to us kind of proved this framework the

173
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:39,520
fact that you could take something a 20

174
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,620
year old idea put it on a completely

175
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:43,840
different platform and revolutionize the

176
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,580
industry well you know maybe they're

177
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:47,020
doing it because of the framework not in

178
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:49,120
spite of it right so we said well you

179
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,650
know if you can make great apps on the

180
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:53,560
mac and the iphone why not the wet so

181
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:56,350
basically what cappuccino is is a port

182
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:58,330
of the cocoa frameworks from the mac and

183
00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:01,900
from the iphone onto the web so to do

184
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:03,280
that we actually created a new language

185
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,140
on top of JavaScript it's called

186
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:07,060
objective J it just adds a few new

187
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:09,190
features to JavaScript so if you've ever

188
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:10,390
wanted to be able to do classical

189
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:11,800
inheritance or be able to you know

190
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,710
import scripts that sort of thing

191
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:16,090
objective J handles it the nice thing

192
00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:18,040
about objective J is that it's a strict

193
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,600
superset of JavaScript and that's just a

194
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,610
fancy way of saying any existing

195
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:23,650
JavaScript will work with objective J so

196
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:24,790
you can take any existing JavaScript

197
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:26,770
framework mix it together with objective

198
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:28,360
J it's just going to work you don't need

199
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,710
to compile it or anything it'll just

200
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:31,900
work in the browser so what I really

201
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:33,400
want to focus on today is our new

202
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,650
version that we're going to be launching

203
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:38,140
soon it's called 0.8 we're in beta right

204
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:42,900
now so we're calling it 0.79 and we

205
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:45,700
focused on a lot of different things for

206
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:48,160
this version but I'm can only hit about

207
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,830
three today and the first big one I want

208
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:52,060
to hit is common J yes and I'm really

209
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:53,770
glad that Chris got to kind of give you

210
00:07:53,770 --> 00:07:55,960
guys an introduction to this before me

211
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,940
so i don't have to focus too much but

212
00:07:57,940 --> 00:07:59,710
common chance is really really important

213
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:02,560
like it's really embarrassing as a

214
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,020
community that anytime we want to do

215
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:06,640
something on the terminal we have to use

216
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:09,310
a different language and i could someone

217
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:10,570
asked earlier you know what's a great

218
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:13,990
use case for calming j/s well 280 slides

219
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:16,840
runs javascript in the server and it

220
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:19,120
sucked having to do it without something

221
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,620
like calm and jas we had to do it on top

222
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:24,010
of rhino which is you know one of the

223
00:08:24,010 --> 00:08:25,060
few and

224
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:27,760
competing for the Medal of slowest

225
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,230
implementation I guess I don't know it's

226
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:32,890
it's it's terrible on top of that any

227
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:34,450
time you want to do anything you have to

228
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:36,760
drop down to Java I didn't start

229
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,680
programming java script to program java

230
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:42,339
so equally terrible and so basically

231
00:08:42,339 --> 00:08:44,080
when it comes to the terminal you can't

232
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,550
really do a lot with JavaScript you can

233
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:47,260
you can add numbers but the second you

234
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:49,210
want to print that result no standard

235
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:50,920
way right the second you want to read

236
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:53,640
Apollo can't do that so common Jas is

237
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:56,410
incredibly important to the JavaScript

238
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:58,779
community and we've invested heavily in

239
00:08:58,779 --> 00:09:01,300
it in the next version of cappuccino so

240
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:04,000
the way we've invested in it is we built

241
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,500
our entire build process on top of

242
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:08,110
gobbling jas we've ported all our tools

243
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:10,180
to come in Jas and we're also going to

244
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:12,250
handle distribution through common Jas

245
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:14,410
so let me kind of explain a little

246
00:09:14,410 --> 00:09:16,779
deeper when we first did cappuccino we

247
00:09:16,779 --> 00:09:18,700
didn't need a build system because it's

248
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:21,730
JavaScript but as it turns out that's

249
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:23,200
kind of a little lie we tell people oh

250
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,370
it's interpreted you don't need to build

251
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:26,140
well you do you need to minify you

252
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:28,150
neither can cat all this stuff so

253
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:29,620
cappuccinos a pretty big framework and

254
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:30,940
it requires doing all this and

255
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:32,500
originally we just wanted something that

256
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:35,710
I was not make and be could be run cross

257
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:37,810
platform and so we settled on ant you

258
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:39,460
know oh you know it's XML must be good

259
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:44,230
it's not one of the nice things about X

260
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:47,470
about aunt was that it you can kind of

261
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:49,450
run JavaScript in it it has a script tag

262
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:52,930
but you can't really and then the second

263
00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:54,850
you want to do something like if what

264
00:09:54,850 --> 00:09:56,560
can't contain no sorry like you know

265
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,930
conditionals no conditionals guys you

266
00:09:58,930 --> 00:10:00,700
need an external library to do a

267
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:02,200
conditional on hand so that was that was

268
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:05,770
pretty terrible so at one point we had

269
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:08,050
half an aunt and like half in this you

270
00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:09,850
know half javascript stuff in script it

271
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:11,980
was a complete mess like most our bug

272
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:13,209
reports were like I don't know how to

273
00:10:13,209 --> 00:10:16,150
build this so then we moved to rake and

274
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:18,040
I have to say that I like rake a lot

275
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:19,600
it's the first build system that didn't

276
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,070
want make me want to gouge my eyes out

277
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:23,770
it's it's a really fantastic tool I

278
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:26,410
actually learned Ruby through rake so

279
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:28,540
that should tell you how great it is I

280
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:29,860
got even know the language and I just

281
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:31,660
kind of picked it up and we ported

282
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:34,570
everything in cappuccino from ant to

283
00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:37,209
rake now that being said it still kind

284
00:10:37,209 --> 00:10:37,990
of sucks that it's not

285
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:41,170
javascript for a number of reasons for

286
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:43,209
starters it's kind of a you know barrier

287
00:10:43,209 --> 00:10:45,550
to entry if someone wants to fix a build

288
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:47,620
bug right they come in they're expecting

289
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:49,390
just JavaScript and then something

290
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:50,589
doesn't work in the build scripts and

291
00:10:50,589 --> 00:10:51,760
they don't really know what to do and

292
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,980
sure you know learning ruby is easy but

293
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:55,690
the answer shouldn't be oh just learn

294
00:10:55,690 --> 00:10:57,250
this new language then you can continue

295
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:58,800
programming in JavaScript no that's not

296
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:02,529
the right thing additionally it's nice

297
00:11:02,529 --> 00:11:05,140
to be able to use your own idioms when

298
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:08,140
you're doing other stuff and the last

299
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:09,910
kind of real deal breaker for us was

300
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:10,870
that we had written all these great

301
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:12,550
tools you know for cappuccino and

302
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:14,350
JavaScript and we couldn't even write

303
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:17,140
use them in our build system so we ended

304
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:19,029
up at this point where we had a parallel

305
00:11:19,029 --> 00:11:20,740
set of tools so we would write like you

306
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:22,779
know something that did something fancy

307
00:11:22,779 --> 00:11:23,890
an objective J and then we'd have to

308
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:25,660
write it in Ruby to just so we could use

309
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:29,020
it on you know this on the terminal as

310
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:31,480
well as on the client-side browser so it

311
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:34,450
became just a management mess so what we

312
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:37,089
did was basically take rake and do a

313
00:11:37,089 --> 00:11:39,220
direct port to javascript it's called

314
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:42,270
Jake and it runs on top of calming j/s

315
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:44,620
it's really nice because it really is a

316
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:47,140
direct port so you know we took we build

317
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:48,910
Atlas on rake and we were able to

318
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:51,490
translate it to Jake and like you know I

319
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:53,860
think half an hour to an hour so I'm

320
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:55,420
just going to quickly show you what

321
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:57,940
that's like so has anyone here used Rick

322
00:11:57,940 --> 00:11:58,870
do you guys use break for your own

323
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:02,350
projects okay so it is kind of how you

324
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:04,660
do things in Reiki you have this build

325
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:07,270
task and then you can do stuff so this

326
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:09,940
with Jake just looks like this so it's a

327
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:10,990
little bit longer because you got that

328
00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:13,380
function keyword but basically oh

329
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:16,060
there's a syntax error there sorry get

330
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:19,570
rid of that parentheses so basically if

331
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:21,640
you want to build something called hello

332
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,790
it'll do whatever is in that function

333
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:26,620
this is how you set up dependencies in

334
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:28,779
rake you say well if you want to build

335
00:12:28,779 --> 00:12:30,760
hello you have to you know build

336
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:32,860
dependency one in dependency to first

337
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:35,529
and this is how you do it in Jake so

338
00:12:35,529 --> 00:12:38,410
just you know passing on the right as

339
00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:40,000
you can see we obviously have to use

340
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,450
strings instead of symbols or whatever

341
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:44,500
the other nice thing about rake is that

342
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,570
you can just kind of append dependencies

343
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:48,940
to an existing task and that still works

344
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:52,120
the same with Jake and it has this

345
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:55,329
really nifty file task which basically

346
00:12:55,329 --> 00:12:57,970
says if this if the file on the right is

347
00:12:57,970 --> 00:13:00,300
dirty rebuild a file on the left and

348
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:04,300
that's exactly the same so again if you

349
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:05,650
already have rake build scripts is it'll

350
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:07,390
be really easy to convert them to Jake

351
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:08,470
and then you can use all your tools and

352
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:11,820
stuff so we're really happy with that so

353
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:14,650
we really love Tom and Jas and you know

354
00:13:14,650 --> 00:13:16,420
everyone knows that for a healthier

355
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:18,730
relationship it's good for the other way

356
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:21,040
to be true too so what's really cool

357
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:24,670
about common Jas is that it's fluent an

358
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:27,310
objective J as well as JavaScript so

359
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:29,020
this is the way we're going to ship

360
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:30,940
cappuccino the next version so instead

361
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:32,470
of this you know go to this website and

362
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:35,170
click something there's the task which

363
00:13:35,170 --> 00:13:36,880
is kind of like gem it's kind of like

364
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,380
Ruby gems and you'll just be able to

365
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:40,570
type tusk install cappuccino and you'll

366
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:41,920
have cappuccino installed on your system

367
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,680
and that solves a really big problem for

368
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:47,949
us which is you know distribution so

369
00:13:47,949 --> 00:13:49,480
this is one example of one of the many

370
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:51,279
cappuccino frameworks out there it's

371
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:52,750
called map kit it allows you to put

372
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:54,399
google maps into your websites and stuff

373
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:56,560
and this sucks today it sucks for

374
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,180
JavaScript programmers you have to go

375
00:13:58,180 --> 00:13:59,890
search your mailing list oh here's the

376
00:13:59,890 --> 00:14:02,430
github URL which branch do i download

377
00:14:02,430 --> 00:14:05,260
it's terrible but you know starting with

378
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:07,690
08 you'll just be able to do this and

379
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:09,100
you will be able to use it in all your

380
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:10,600
apps so I'm really excited about that

381
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,800
and this is just kind of the way you

382
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:18,100
define your little comment je s module

383
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:19,329
and the only thing I wanted to point out

384
00:14:19,329 --> 00:14:21,640
is that there's these objective J

385
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:23,110
frameworks and objective jadeybug

386
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:25,300
frameworks fields which let you say this

387
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:26,949
is my objective J stuff so you can shape

388
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:29,500
objective J and JavaScript so I'm really

389
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,360
looking forward to be able being able to

390
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,220
have you know like a nice package

391
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:35,079
website where people can you know easily

392
00:14:35,079 --> 00:14:38,199
install stuff the other big thing we

393
00:14:38,199 --> 00:14:39,910
wanted to focus on was performance and

394
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:41,620
the only aspect of that I'm going to

395
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:45,370
talk about today is spriting so spriting

396
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:47,050
is not just for images right it's kind

397
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:49,149
of this abstract concept and the one

398
00:14:49,149 --> 00:14:50,770
form of spriting that I think all

399
00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:52,420
JavaScript frameworks get right is

400
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:55,150
spriting of actual scripts right you

401
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:56,710
know you go in and you have a million J

402
00:14:56,710 --> 00:14:58,510
files and if you want something

403
00:14:58,510 --> 00:15:00,640
performing you kind of concatenate them

404
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:03,430
all together and that's you know poor

405
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:08,470
man's fighting for that so the one

406
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:10,420
that's more interesting though and fewer

407
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:13,720
frameworks get right is images so this

408
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,400
is exactly the same idea right you have

409
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:19,210
a bunch of images and if you leave them

410
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:21,520
all separate when you load them up you

411
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,380
get lots of latency because every single

412
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:26,680
image is a different request and more

413
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:29,080
importantly it looks really bad if you

414
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,700
don't sprite them right because your

415
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:32,590
website's loaded and then stuffs kind of

416
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:34,540
just starts coming in so this is

417
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:37,270
something that admittedly cappuccino 0.7

418
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:38,800
did really poorly and by really poorly I

419
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:42,280
mean not at all so one of the things we

420
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:44,020
want to do was get this right so the

421
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:45,640
benefits of spriting again are obvious

422
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,740
right you get less image overhead if you

423
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:49,270
put a bunch of images together all that

424
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:51,220
redundant stuff kind of goes away right

425
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:53,470
with all the headers of an image less

426
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:55,570
latency right you push one thing instead

427
00:15:55,570 --> 00:15:57,610
of many and again there's this proceed

428
00:15:57,610 --> 00:15:59,350
speed issue right your website feels

429
00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:02,860
faster because everything snaps in but

430
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:03,850
there are a bunch of problems with

431
00:16:03,850 --> 00:16:06,070
spriting to and I think spriting right

432
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:09,250
now is still kind of primitive in that

433
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:12,040
it's not so much an optimization is kind

434
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:13,600
of a manual task that you have to do

435
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,670
right when we first started spriting

436
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:17,770
script files together or no no I'm sorry

437
00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:19,690
when we first started doing minimization

438
00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:22,390
of JavaScript it was kind of broken

439
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:24,100
right like the the very first

440
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:26,500
minimizer's was sometimes mess up on

441
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:27,940
your code and then you know you had this

442
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:29,410
thing that worked when you just shipped

443
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:31,000
to JavaScript but then you minimized it

444
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,710
and it didn't work and you weren't sure

445
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:35,080
we weren't quite sure why and then you

446
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,460
went back and it's 0 it doesn't

447
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:37,960
understand global variable so I have to

448
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,460
do all this stuff and what I'm trying to

449
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:41,860
say by that is that with minimization

450
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:44,230
originally we had to do all this work to

451
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:45,940
work around the minimizer right because

452
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:47,170
it didn't really understand JavaScript

453
00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:49,060
that well and that's I think the stage

454
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:50,980
we're at right now with image spriting

455
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:52,690
because the spider doesn't know if your

456
00:16:52,690 --> 00:16:54,100
things going to repeat horizontally or

457
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:55,510
vertically we're going to need to be

458
00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:56,830
stretched or if it's going to be drawn

459
00:16:56,830 --> 00:17:00,280
to a canvas so it's it's not as easy

460
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:02,170
it's just saying take my images and make

461
00:17:02,170 --> 00:17:03,850
them optimized you actually have to

462
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:05,380
physically go in there and say okay this

463
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:07,240
one's for horizontal

464
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:09,100
so once for vertical blah blah blah then

465
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:10,569
someone goes in changes the code and now

466
00:17:10,569 --> 00:17:15,280
it's broken so that sucks we wanted to

467
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:18,130
fix that so the solution we came up with

468
00:17:18,130 --> 00:17:21,819
what oh yeah so sorry the result of all

469
00:17:21,819 --> 00:17:23,890
that is that this dream of you know you

470
00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:25,720
take all your images and you get kind of

471
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:28,270
one shippable image isn't really true

472
00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:31,059
right you end up with you take a bunch

473
00:17:31,059 --> 00:17:33,250
of images and you ship the horizontal

474
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:35,800
the vertical stretchable and whatever so

475
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,990
it's certainly better than shipping a

476
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:39,580
bunch of individual images but it's not

477
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:42,220
that dream of shipping one thing that

478
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:45,760
just works and on top of that you also

479
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,550
have to ship your code separately so

480
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:50,980
maybe five downloads instead of 25 it

481
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:52,830
would still be nice if it could be one

482
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:56,140
so this kind of solves that problem the

483
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:58,900
data URL allows you to put image data

484
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:04,210
right into text what's really nice about

485
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:05,380
this is that you can make it a hundred

486
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:06,700
percent automated right you can take all

487
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:08,320
your images and shove them into a text

488
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:11,500
file as data URLs not a problem you know

489
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:12,790
it doesn't matter how you if they're

490
00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:14,200
vertical if they're horizontal if you're

491
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,690
going to draw on the canvas they're just

492
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:18,190
basically binary data in your txt file

493
00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:20,530
so it just works the other really nice

494
00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:22,300
thing about this is that you always get

495
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:24,220
one file no matter what for that same

496
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:25,510
reason you can always shove everything

497
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:29,920
in one file what are the problems with

498
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:32,080
data URLs well one of the problems is

499
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,760
that the files get slightly bigger you

500
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,740
know base64 is slightly bigger than the

501
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:38,350
actual binary representation it's not so

502
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:40,300
bad when you turn G zipping on since it

503
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:41,559
handles a lot of the common stuff

504
00:18:41,559 --> 00:18:43,480
anyways but I think the main problem

505
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:44,950
that most people have on their minds as

506
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:46,690
I say this right now is but it doesn't

507
00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:48,760
work on aight well it does work in IE as

508
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,830
it turns out and it has since ie6 and

509
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:53,020
it's called em HTML and this is like

510
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:55,450
their format for basically shipping any

511
00:18:55,450 --> 00:18:57,760
arbitrary resource so what we've done is

512
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,679
actually built this into cappuccino you

513
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:00,880
know if you have images it'll

514
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:04,600
automatically mhtml them or base64 URL

515
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:09,040
fi them and so your entire app the whole

516
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:11,890
thing text images everything gets

517
00:19:11,890 --> 00:19:14,620
shipped in one download and we've been

518
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:15,910
trying this out and it's really amazing

519
00:19:15,910 --> 00:19:20,220
it feels great this is all of cappuccino

520
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:23,170
this is foundation app kid the default

521
00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:27,340
theme it's just 250k gzipped and what's

522
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:29,260
really nice is it's everything right its

523
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:32,350
images everything you're done with one

524
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:39,100
download yeah so the other nice thing

525
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:40,450
about this is that we built this into

526
00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:41,410
the build tool so if you have a

527
00:19:41,410 --> 00:19:42,580
cappuccino application will

528
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:44,860
automatically do this for you so I think

529
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:47,380
I think this is the way to do spriting

530
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:48,670
because the other way just doesn't scale

531
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:51,430
in my opinion the way of hey you know

532
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:52,960
this guy changes code and all of a

533
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,670
sudden the images show up incorrectly if

534
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:56,710
you the bigger and bigger your apps get

535
00:19:56,710 --> 00:19:57,820
your going to want something that just

536
00:19:57,820 --> 00:20:00,070
works and I'm really excited about

537
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:02,050
shipping the feature the other thing

538
00:20:02,050 --> 00:20:04,480
we've been focusing a lot on is one of

539
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:07,990
our users favorite tools which is nib to

540
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:10,030
save are you guys familiar with apples

541
00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:14,350
interface builder on the Mac no okay i

542
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:19,270
will show it to you right now so as I

543
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:21,820
said we kind of formed cappuccino

544
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:23,200
because we really like the way you make

545
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,480
applications on the mac and one of the

546
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:27,400
big differences between the way you make

547
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,630
applications on the mac and the way to

548
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:31,420
make applications elsewhere is this tool

549
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:34,630
called interface builder so the way

550
00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:36,130
actually start an application on the mac

551
00:20:36,130 --> 00:20:37,690
is you start up interface builder and

552
00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:38,950
you and you actually edit your interface

553
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:44,500
and this will take looks like in here so

554
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:46,870
this is kind of just a mac app right now

555
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:50,110
if i hit run there's the mac app it's

556
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:52,870
just as hello world on it and what you

557
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:56,620
can actually do with cappuccino is take

558
00:20:56,620 --> 00:21:01,900
this interface and convert it so that it

559
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:07,249
works on the web

560
00:21:07,259 --> 00:21:09,609
so if I double-click this this is

561
00:21:09,609 --> 00:21:10,929
actually like kind of the default way

562
00:21:10,929 --> 00:21:13,929
that you make applications on with

563
00:21:13,929 --> 00:21:15,789
cappuccino so as you can see there's a

564
00:21:15,789 --> 00:21:17,649
tiny bit of difference right this is

565
00:21:17,649 --> 00:21:20,709
kind of full screen instead of a little

566
00:21:20,709 --> 00:21:26,599
individual window the reason for that is

567
00:21:26,609 --> 00:21:29,349
here we just tell the window to get full

568
00:21:29,349 --> 00:21:31,570
screen but if I turn that off it'll look

569
00:21:31,570 --> 00:21:34,059
exactly like the one I just showed you

570
00:21:34,059 --> 00:21:36,070
right so let me show you how you

571
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:39,159
actually do stuff I'm going to build

572
00:21:39,159 --> 00:21:41,139
kind of a little contrived example you

573
00:21:41,139 --> 00:21:43,029
would never do this in real life I'm

574
00:21:43,029 --> 00:21:44,229
going to build a browser within the

575
00:21:44,229 --> 00:21:47,169
browser but i'll give you an idea of all

576
00:21:47,169 --> 00:21:48,969
the widgets and stuff so if we the first

577
00:21:48,969 --> 00:21:50,019
thing we want is our little browser

578
00:21:50,019 --> 00:21:51,429
window so i'm just going to drag out a

579
00:21:51,429 --> 00:21:56,469
window here this is my new window then

580
00:21:56,469 --> 00:22:00,009
make it a little bigger and now we want

581
00:22:00,009 --> 00:22:01,509
a URL field to actually be able to type

582
00:22:01,509 --> 00:22:04,149
the URL right so i'm going to grab this

583
00:22:04,149 --> 00:22:06,969
URL and I mean this text field and drag

584
00:22:06,969 --> 00:22:10,029
it out make it a little bigger now I'm

585
00:22:10,029 --> 00:22:11,709
going to grab a button this is our back

586
00:22:11,709 --> 00:22:19,659
button type back and I'm going to grab a

587
00:22:19,659 --> 00:22:27,220
web view

588
00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:29,960
so this is where interface builder

589
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:31,970
really shines because it's kind of with

590
00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:33,650
other UI builders this is where you stop

591
00:22:33,650 --> 00:22:35,990
like okay now I gotta assign an ID and

592
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:37,490
then I'll go get it into them that's not

593
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:38,390
what you do an interface builder

594
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:40,100
interface builder allows you to take the

595
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:41,390
next step of actually assigning

596
00:22:41,390 --> 00:22:44,480
behaviors to these elements so this is

597
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,160
my browser so what I'm going to do is

598
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:48,530
control click I'm going to connect this

599
00:22:48,530 --> 00:22:50,660
and say you know what just take the URL

600
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:52,669
from this text field I'm going to

601
00:22:52,669 --> 00:22:54,679
connect this button let's say well go

602
00:22:54,679 --> 00:22:57,559
back so the last thing we want to do is

603
00:22:57,559 --> 00:22:58,940
actually be able to show this window so

604
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:02,700
I'm going to open up my main menu and

605
00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:04,669
we'll go to the window here and we'll

606
00:23:04,669 --> 00:23:08,000
just type browser and I'm going to click

607
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,330
here and I'm going to hit command be so

608
00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:14,510
that's another way to open it up and now

609
00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:16,520
again I want to show this window so all

610
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:18,890
I do is control click from the menu item

611
00:23:18,890 --> 00:23:22,750
to the window and call order front and

612
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:26,600
the last thing I'm going to do is just

613
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:28,040
say that this window should not be

614
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:29,299
visible when we originally launched the

615
00:23:29,299 --> 00:23:33,169
program so I'll save this and I will run

616
00:23:33,169 --> 00:23:38,419
me up to sit once again and I want to

617
00:23:38,419 --> 00:23:42,380
refresh just out of the way we've got

618
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:47,980
this browser it is i can type in a URL

619
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:51,830
and it's a little slow but it's loading

620
00:23:51,830 --> 00:24:01,760
it slow

621
00:24:01,770 --> 00:24:04,300
no internet

622
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:06,460
alright guys stop stop torrenting for a

623
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:09,180
little bit so I can do my demo here oh

624
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:11,890
no but I'm ethernet it this should be

625
00:24:11,890 --> 00:24:14,920
you know rock solid alright well sorry

626
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:18,940
guys this would show apple com but the

627
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:20,320
other nice thing is I can close this

628
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,910
window and again I can hit command B and

629
00:24:21,910 --> 00:24:23,020
I'll just open up I don't need to worry

630
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:25,030
about the key presses or key commands or

631
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:26,680
whatever it's just going to work if you

632
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:30,460
have an internet connection so I wanted

633
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:31,750
to show you a real life example right

634
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:33,760
this is just a demo but sofa just

635
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:36,190
launched their own cappuccino

636
00:24:36,190 --> 00:24:38,440
application for their new app which is

637
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:42,070
building stores online and this is it so

638
00:24:42,070 --> 00:24:44,500
you kind of you know set up like how

639
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:48,820
people can buy sell or whatever it's

640
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:51,610
just like a management tool for for

641
00:24:51,610 --> 00:24:53,200
setting up a website and this was built

642
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,780
entirely using it to say so every single

643
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:57,010
piece of you I you see was actually

644
00:24:57,010 --> 00:24:59,410
built on a Mac tested first on a mac and

645
00:24:59,410 --> 00:25:01,600
then converted to the web so that's

646
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:02,860
pretty exciting and obviously written

647
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:04,600
with JavaScript and objective J and I'll

648
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:07,120
show you that in more detail in a second

649
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:10,600
as well so that's nip to sip it allows

650
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:12,370
you to use interface builder and this is

651
00:25:12,370 --> 00:25:13,690
all open source of course so you can

652
00:25:13,690 --> 00:25:16,750
download and just use it it makes making

653
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:19,930
these kind of apps a lot easier so now I

654
00:25:19,930 --> 00:25:21,310
want to talk about the product that

655
00:25:21,310 --> 00:25:22,390
we're going to be releasing pretty soon

656
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:26,170
which is called 280 Atlas came back to

657
00:25:26,170 --> 00:25:28,110
my presentation just to show that's like

658
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:31,810
so basically ninja tip is pretty cool

659
00:25:31,810 --> 00:25:34,270
and it got us you know part of the way

660
00:25:34,270 --> 00:25:36,850
there but it's not the full answer right

661
00:25:36,850 --> 00:25:39,730
it's designed for desktop apps you know

662
00:25:39,730 --> 00:25:42,010
the widgets don't look exactly the same

663
00:25:42,010 --> 00:25:43,960
as when we convert them for the web you

664
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:45,460
know it's not built to talk to web

665
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:47,350
services that sort of thing so we've

666
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:48,910
done is actually build our own version

667
00:25:48,910 --> 00:25:50,440
of this called atlas so I'm going to go

668
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:51,490
ahead and launch that and I'll show it

669
00:25:51,490 --> 00:25:57,640
to you right now so I'm going to make a

670
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:13,149
new project

671
00:26:13,159 --> 00:26:17,409
so this is the kind of project manager

672
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:20,419
here's our code you can type your

673
00:26:20,419 --> 00:26:22,309
JavaScript objective J or whatever but

674
00:26:22,309 --> 00:26:24,409
again the kind of what makes us

675
00:26:24,409 --> 00:26:26,779
different is the interface editing

676
00:26:26,779 --> 00:26:29,119
capabilities so I come here and they

677
00:26:29,119 --> 00:26:30,289
should look familiar it's kind of like

678
00:26:30,289 --> 00:26:32,499
interface builder if I double-click this

679
00:26:32,499 --> 00:26:38,720
week the window a little bigger this is

680
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,220
this is kind of like our browser window

681
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:41,450
right it looks like a little browser

682
00:26:41,450 --> 00:26:44,330
window so I can do just a quick example

683
00:26:44,330 --> 00:26:47,690
here I'll drag this in and I'll drag in

684
00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:50,929
a text field and these guides are really

685
00:26:50,929 --> 00:26:53,720
smart they're not just you know aligned

686
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:54,919
to something else to actually tell you

687
00:26:54,919 --> 00:26:56,210
you know this should be 10 pixels away

688
00:26:56,210 --> 00:27:01,940
from this guy or whatever so we have the

689
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:03,289
same connection technologies interface

690
00:27:03,289 --> 00:27:04,369
builder so I can actually connect these

691
00:27:04,369 --> 00:27:07,429
two and just say you know take the flow

692
00:27:07,429 --> 00:27:10,249
value from this and if I save it and hit

693
00:27:10,249 --> 00:27:15,060
run actually let me do one more thing

694
00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:18,080
just that's so it stays centered so now

695
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:25,550
if I hit run this will launch up Safari

696
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,900
and here we go this is our slider in our

697
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:29,520
text field and as you see if I how to

698
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:30,810
move it across it's just going to stay

699
00:27:30,810 --> 00:27:35,550
updated thanks to that connection so all

700
00:27:35,550 --> 00:27:36,870
these built-in connections are nice but

701
00:27:36,870 --> 00:27:38,280
obviously they can only do what the

702
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:39,900
original widget designer intended them

703
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:41,580
to do so i want to show you how to build

704
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:43,050
new kinds of connections so i'm going to

705
00:27:43,050 --> 00:27:46,020
do another kind of simple example the

706
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:47,700
first thing i'm going to make this just

707
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:50,280
an ordinary window like we did in

708
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:52,350
interface builder so I'm just going to

709
00:27:52,350 --> 00:27:54,120
say do not fill the browser window so

710
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:57,450
now it becomes a normal window and I'm

711
00:27:57,450 --> 00:28:00,570
going to drag out just an ordinary view

712
00:28:00,570 --> 00:28:08,220
that does nothing I got a button will

713
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:11,730
label this one blue I'll drag out

714
00:28:11,730 --> 00:28:15,960
another button label this one read now

715
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,580
again I want to write code that

716
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:19,080
interacts with these objects and that's

717
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:20,040
going to be hard to do because they

718
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:22,410
exist and you know layout land and not

719
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:24,240
code land so I'm going to do here is

720
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,460
just come to my code and create an

721
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:30,480
outlet so i'm going to say at outlet CP

722
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:34,620
view my view save that and if i come

723
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:37,320
back now here's that object that i just

724
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:40,500
edited it understands that this can be a

725
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:43,290
view so I'm going to connect that now

726
00:28:43,290 --> 00:28:44,850
I've connected that view so anytime I

727
00:28:44,850 --> 00:28:46,890
write in my code my view it's going to

728
00:28:46,890 --> 00:28:49,110
be talking about that object but now I

729
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:50,250
want to be able to do something from

730
00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:52,980
those buttons so if I show you I try to

731
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:54,990
make a connection from my button it

732
00:28:54,990 --> 00:28:57,780
doesn't work so I'm going to do is

733
00:28:57,780 --> 00:28:59,790
create an action so I'm going to come

734
00:28:59,790 --> 00:29:16,549
here and type ad action make you read

735
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:33,850
and I'll do another one for the blue

736
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:36,320
save that and now if I come back to my

737
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:40,220
interface I can connect and I can choose

738
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:44,360
make view read connect here select make

739
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:53,139
view blue and if I save and run

740
00:29:53,149 --> 00:29:55,399
here's the window I hit read it becomes

741
00:29:55,399 --> 00:29:57,109
rare if I did we become school there you

742
00:29:57,109 --> 00:30:00,889
go so one of the things that cappuccino

743
00:30:00,889 --> 00:30:02,869
gets really right is what we like to

744
00:30:02,869 --> 00:30:04,489
call document based application so

745
00:30:04,489 --> 00:30:05,960
things like marking birds that I showed

746
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:07,820
you where you make a document or Twitty

747
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:09,469
slides and you have to save and all that

748
00:30:09,469 --> 00:30:11,929
sort of thing so what I'd like to quit

749
00:30:11,929 --> 00:30:15,259
it so I'd like to do now is show you an

750
00:30:15,259 --> 00:30:17,089
example of making a document based

751
00:30:17,089 --> 00:30:19,070
application so when it come here i'm

752
00:30:19,070 --> 00:30:20,690
going to say new i'm going to choose

753
00:30:20,690 --> 00:30:22,909
document based app and we're going to

754
00:30:22,909 --> 00:30:28,909
make a text editor and all of you are

755
00:30:28,909 --> 00:30:31,609
familiar with best Phineas our friend

756
00:30:31,609 --> 00:30:37,639
Dion over here created so if i go to my

757
00:30:37,639 --> 00:30:40,519
resources i have the main interface just

758
00:30:40,519 --> 00:30:42,619
like before it has my menu and stuff but

759
00:30:42,619 --> 00:30:44,919
i also have another interface file

760
00:30:44,919 --> 00:30:47,599
specifically for my documents so if i

761
00:30:47,599 --> 00:30:50,299
come here right now it just has nothing

762
00:30:50,299 --> 00:30:54,769
so if I I click run just going to load

763
00:30:54,769 --> 00:30:56,149
kind of an empty document based

764
00:30:56,149 --> 00:30:58,849
application and I can make many of them

765
00:30:58,849 --> 00:31:01,269
but obviously they're pretty useless

766
00:31:01,269 --> 00:31:05,149
there you go so alice is really

767
00:31:05,149 --> 00:31:06,529
extensible with plugins so we've decided

768
00:31:06,529 --> 00:31:09,679
to do is just build investment so i can

769
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:11,960
drag that's been out straub drag and

770
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:13,759
drop it in i'm just going to make it the

771
00:31:13,759 --> 00:31:19,249
entire size of the window and i will set

772
00:31:19,249 --> 00:31:21,049
the resizing flags here to kind of

773
00:31:21,049 --> 00:31:22,759
stretch with the window so one of the

774
00:31:22,759 --> 00:31:23,659
nice things is you don't have to keep

775
00:31:23,659 --> 00:31:25,789
switching between browser and and atlas

776
00:31:25,789 --> 00:31:27,739
all the time we have this test button or

777
00:31:27,739 --> 00:31:29,989
you can just say test in place so it's

778
00:31:29,989 --> 00:31:32,210
all kind of ambiguous in place so there

779
00:31:32,210 --> 00:31:34,159
you go there's best been so we can make

780
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:35,330
sure that it works before we actually

781
00:31:35,330 --> 00:31:36,889
committed and trying the whole app and

782
00:31:36,889 --> 00:31:38,929
it seems to be okay so now let's

783
00:31:38,929 --> 00:31:40,519
actually go ahead and try it in the

784
00:31:40,519 --> 00:31:45,720
browser so

785
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:47,580
there is best bin and I can make you

786
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:49,200
know lots of them and I can come in here

787
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:53,310
and I can't i make syntax errors there

788
00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:56,220
we go and eat and these are also very

789
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:57,720
smart they all have their own individual

790
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:59,070
on deuce taks as you can see i'm on

791
00:31:59,070 --> 00:32:00,330
doing here and then i can come here and

792
00:32:00,330 --> 00:32:02,190
undo their and everything's just going

793
00:32:02,190 --> 00:32:06,330
to work so the other big problem we

794
00:32:06,330 --> 00:32:07,650
wanted to solve with atlas was you know

795
00:32:07,650 --> 00:32:08,880
you put in all this work and you make

796
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:11,430
this really great web app but at least

797
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:13,740
for the time being there's a really big

798
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:15,270
problem with well what happens when I'm

799
00:32:15,270 --> 00:32:17,400
offline right or what happens when you

800
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:19,290
know I want to sell to someone who

801
00:32:19,290 --> 00:32:21,690
doesn't really trust aiding my servers

802
00:32:21,690 --> 00:32:26,520
for their information so again cavatina

803
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:28,230
wasn't necessarily about the web it was

804
00:32:28,230 --> 00:32:30,510
about applications that happened to run

805
00:32:30,510 --> 00:32:33,270
on the web so we've done is you can come

806
00:32:33,270 --> 00:32:34,920
up here to this pop-up button and right

807
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,210
now it's set up to run on the browser

808
00:32:36,210 --> 00:32:38,880
but I can just select native desktop and

809
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,530
instead of hitting run I'm going to hit

810
00:32:40,530 --> 00:32:47,280
build this will take a second as you can

811
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:49,410
see this is the same exact JavaScript

812
00:32:49,410 --> 00:32:50,970
application this is all running

813
00:32:50,970 --> 00:32:52,710
JavaScript running natively on my mac

814
00:32:52,710 --> 00:32:54,240
and you know i can make new documents or

815
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,740
whatever so this is now a text editor

816
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:58,260
that runs both on my desktop and on the

817
00:32:58,260 --> 00:33:02,250
web and if you didn't notice before this

818
00:33:02,250 --> 00:33:03,840
is actually how we built atlas you know

819
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:05,340
when i was editing code this is actually

820
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:08,100
just a best bin view so we built atlas

821
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:10,170
in atlas every single line of code that

822
00:33:10,170 --> 00:33:11,310
i showed you today is one hundred

823
00:33:11,310 --> 00:33:13,140
percent JavaScript and objective J and

824
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:15,030
to give you one additional example of

825
00:33:15,030 --> 00:33:17,120
that I'm going to go ahead and open up

826
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,440
to 80 slides which we wrote a while ago

827
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:26,930
before we even started all this stuff

828
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:29,640
this is a tweety slides project and if

829
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:33,720
you recall here it was running in the

830
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:36,450
browser so now this is the exact same

831
00:33:36,450 --> 00:33:38,040
code I'm just going to select native

832
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:39,360
desktop I'm going to hit build this

833
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:40,200
one's going to take a little longer

834
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,760
because there's actual stuff in there

835
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:47,760
and sign a demo there we go so it

836
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,500
launches up I can say create new

837
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:53,130
application I can select this and here

838
00:33:53,130 --> 00:34:01,690
is 280 slides running as a desktop oops

839
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:04,050
about them so here's 20 slides running

840
00:34:04,050 --> 00:34:06,420
as a desktop application so if you're

841
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:07,920
not online you can still create and edit

842
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,780
your presentations do whatever here's

843
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:11,340
that little media panel it becomes a

844
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:12,750
real deal window so everything just

845
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:14,220
works the way you'd expect it to work

846
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:26,270
offline and online so that's atlas

847
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:33,220
thank computers crashing here we go

848
00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:37,750
yeah okay there we go so that's atlas

849
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:40,520
we're going to be releasing the beta as

850
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:42,710
I paid beta for twenty dollars November

851
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:44,659
15th that's a week from now so you won't

852
00:34:44,659 --> 00:34:46,310
see me online for that whole week as I'm

853
00:34:46,310 --> 00:34:49,040
fixing bugs it's really cool I think

854
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,720
we're going to be seeding stuff out

855
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:52,669
about once a week you're going to be

856
00:34:52,669 --> 00:34:54,020
able to test it out kind of help us

857
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:55,940
finish it along and then when we release

858
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:57,530
the final obviously the twenty dollars

859
00:34:57,530 --> 00:35:00,770
will be removed from that price so

860
00:35:00,770 --> 00:35:02,630
everything I showed you except for Atlas

861
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:06,290
is a completely open source you can

862
00:35:06,290 --> 00:35:07,609
check it out on twitter north /

863
00:35:07,609 --> 00:35:10,160
cappuccino on github if you go to just

864
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:11,600
280 north you'll see all our projects

865
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:14,090
and so include like commonjs we have a

866
00:35:14,090 --> 00:35:15,920
pretty far along implementation of that

867
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,570
called narwhal which tom will be talking

868
00:35:17,570 --> 00:35:19,550
about tomorrow Jake all these tools that

869
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:23,359
I showed you and yeah you can always hit

870
00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:25,640
cappuccino org it is the first hit for

871
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:27,770
cappuccino on Google if you spell it

872
00:35:27,770 --> 00:35:30,530
correctly and here are some more length

873
00:35:30,530 --> 00:35:51,530
thanks a lot guys

874
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:54,670
Thank You Francisco do you guys have any

875
00:35:54,670 --> 00:35:56,829
dealers have any questions for Francisco

876
00:35:56,829 --> 00:36:05,890
while he's up here

877
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:10,090
no no the Nate oh yes the question was

878
00:36:10,090 --> 00:36:12,650
when an atlas we turn web apps into

879
00:36:12,650 --> 00:36:14,480
desktop apps that they only run on OS 10

880
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:16,790
and the answer is no when we ship Atlas

881
00:36:16,790 --> 00:36:19,870
it will work both on OS 10 and windows I

882
00:36:19,870 --> 00:36:22,100
mean it's it's just web stuff guys

883
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:23,960
that's a whole point of who's relying on

884
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:32,930
standards the the best bin editor plugin

885
00:36:32,930 --> 00:36:36,410
will only run on the browsers that best

886
00:36:36,410 --> 00:36:38,810
in supports all of cappuccino works you

887
00:36:38,810 --> 00:36:41,360
know ie Firefox Safari everything but if

888
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:43,250
external parties build plugins that only

889
00:36:43,250 --> 00:36:58,460
work on one then the only work there

890
00:36:58,470 --> 00:37:03,840
yeah so when you run I wanted oh yeah so

891
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:06,300
the question was are there hooks for OS

892
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:09,420
specific things so the way again I don't

893
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:10,680
I don't have a lot of time to get into a

894
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:12,810
lot of detail how this desktop stuff

895
00:37:12,810 --> 00:37:14,099
kind of magically works and you can talk

896
00:37:14,099 --> 00:37:15,780
to the file system and stuff but

897
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:18,240
basically when you ship a web app you

898
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:19,770
have the client side component and the

899
00:37:19,770 --> 00:37:22,500
server component right and you do front

900
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:24,359
end stuff on the client side and then

901
00:37:24,359 --> 00:37:25,590
when you want to save a file or whatever

902
00:37:25,590 --> 00:37:27,780
it gets pushed to the server so we have

903
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:30,630
that exact same architecture on the

904
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:32,730
desktop apps so we actually ship your

905
00:37:32,730 --> 00:37:34,740
server code with your client side code

906
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:37,020
in these desktop apps and the server

907
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:38,460
code can do whatever it wants it can

908
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:40,020
write files it can read files it can

909
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:42,690
start other processes whatever so if you

910
00:37:42,690 --> 00:37:45,570
want to you know from your client side

911
00:37:45,570 --> 00:37:46,680
JavaScript do something you know

912
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:49,050
platform specific all you have to do is

913
00:37:49,050 --> 00:37:51,030
create a restful request to your own

914
00:37:51,030 --> 00:37:53,280
little private server which can then do

915
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,260
whatever it wants on any operating

916
00:37:55,260 --> 00:38:02,860
system right does that make sense

917
00:38:02,870 --> 00:38:08,340
um way better no um how would we compare

918
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:10,860
sprout core to cappuccino I mean they're

919
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:12,900
really two different approaches to a

920
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:18,150
problem we our approach was Coco is a

921
00:38:18,150 --> 00:38:19,710
really great framework we want to get

922
00:38:19,710 --> 00:38:22,080
that up and running as fast as possible

923
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:24,270
on the web it's kind of similar to what

924
00:38:24,270 --> 00:38:26,190
we did with Jake right we're not out

925
00:38:26,190 --> 00:38:29,070
here to reinvent build tools like that's

926
00:38:29,070 --> 00:38:30,450
not an interesting problem someone's

927
00:38:30,450 --> 00:38:32,340
already gotten it right you know people

928
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:34,320
a lot older than me and a lot wiser than

929
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:36,240
me have like figured out the api's and

930
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:38,310
gotten it all right there's not that

931
00:38:38,310 --> 00:38:39,840
much difference between the desktop and

932
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:41,370
the web let's just get it up and running

933
00:38:41,370 --> 00:38:43,920
and that's the reason that we're able to

934
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,270
do things like nib to save with

935
00:38:45,270 --> 00:38:46,830
interface builder the reason we're able

936
00:38:46,830 --> 00:38:48,840
to do Atlas all this stuff we have a

937
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:50,430
running head start because we're

938
00:38:50,430 --> 00:38:51,840
cheating we're using something that's

939
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:55,270
already proven to work really well

940
00:38:55,280 --> 00:39:02,700
answer your question well apples using a

941
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:03,780
lot of frameworks I mean they're using

942
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:05,730
jQuery on the main apple site and

943
00:39:05,730 --> 00:39:06,900
they're using dojo and other parts of

944
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:09,360
the site and for some reason the part of

945
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:10,590
the site that they hired a bunch of

946
00:39:10,590 --> 00:39:11,970
contractors who wrote Spratt for is

947
00:39:11,970 --> 00:39:21,010
using sprout board so cool
