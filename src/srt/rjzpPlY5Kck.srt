1
00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:08,910

alright a security carol it is near the

2
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:10,469
holidays so I thought we would do

3
00:00:10,469 --> 00:00:12,540
something a little bit different than

4
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:16,800
the traditional boring security talk so

5
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,890
gather round friends and I shall tell

6
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:21,779
you a tale it was a bleak december morn

7
00:00:21,779 --> 00:00:24,390
one year ago today that i was visited by

8
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:28,230
three spectres but these were not the

9
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:31,109
ghost of some Yuletide holiday what with

10
00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:32,730
their message of goodwill for all

11
00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:35,070
mankind and all that good stuff this

12
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:36,329
story isn't going to end with me

13
00:00:36,329 --> 00:00:38,640
flipping sub stack a Bitcoin and having

14
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,950
him buy us all at Christmas goose Plus

15
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:46,500
no Tiny Tim sorry that being said I I

16
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:47,940
totally was visited by three

17
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:49,739
otherworldly messengers at night the

18
00:00:49,739 --> 00:00:52,379
ghosts of security past present and

19
00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:55,860
future so press close friends for the

20
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:57,629
night is dark ignore the fact that it's

21
00:00:57,629 --> 00:01:00,690
like 2pm and even now I can sense their

22
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:02,969
ghastly presence roaming these halls I

23
00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:04,890
was a different man then I bore little

24
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:07,619
mind as I was a puppet to security needs

25
00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:09,630
I was pissing the night away playing

26
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:13,380
everquest uh and the cold wind swept

27
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:15,509
through my office the chill went up my

28
00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:18,470
spine along with a sense of foreboding

29
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:21,270
but I talked it all up to a bit of

30
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:23,580
underdone potato and a bad can of

31
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:27,770
redbull I said a bad can not a big can

32
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:30,329
but as soon as I rose and shut the door

33
00:01:30,329 --> 00:01:33,090
a ghastly countenance unknown to me swam

34
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:36,780
up from the dark ebenezer Baldwin it

35
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:39,990
said to me Sony I mean Sonny I gasped is

36
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:42,659
that you yes Baldwin I've come to warn

37
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:44,579
you about the grim consequences of your

38
00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:47,189
actions for you have not dedicated

39
00:01:47,189 --> 00:01:48,750
yourself to security you will end up

40
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:51,509
like me completely owned and dragging

41
00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:54,780
your volatiles around with you for all

42
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:57,509
eternity three ghosts will visit you

43
00:01:57,509 --> 00:02:00,119
tonight heed their words oh you mean

44
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:03,180
like a Christmas carol ah more like

45
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:05,549
Scrooged but keep an eye out anyway and

46
00:02:05,549 --> 00:02:10,550
he was gone

47
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:15,520
so sometime later I scarcely return to

48
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,620
my Labor's when the window blew open and

49
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:19,540
the first spectral visitor floated in on

50
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:23,380
the breeze on his feet he wore roller

51
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:25,690
blades and from his belt dangled a

52
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:28,150
jingling nest of lockpicks ignore the

53
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:29,620
fact that that's alignments hand said

54
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:31,780
Baldwin he said I am the ghost of

55
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:34,630
security past I've come to warn you not

56
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:36,040
to forget the lessons you have learned

57
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:38,500
from hackers past confidentiality

58
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:41,050
integrity integrity availability and

59
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:43,870
non-repudiation mind you Baldwin the

60
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:46,210
air-gapped the air-gap least some fool

61
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:49,140
gank your laptop and pretend to be you

62
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:52,000
hit the bricks ghost eyes told him I

63
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,240
already I already know that 99% of all

64
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,440
security issues that you're going to run

65
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,120
into have been solved in other languages

66
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:00,580
already the ghost looked shocked even

67
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:02,080
though even through his otherworldly

68
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,050
pallor what seriously he asked yeah

69
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:09,190
check it out I said so at this point I

70
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:12,640
decided to pontificate to set date

71
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:16,840
Murphy from hackers ghost many problems

72
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:21,520
in security have already been solved one

73
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,920
you know we're standing on the shoulder

74
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:28,860
of giants in node we are a very young

75
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:32,730
community and language and platform and

76
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:35,380
sometimes I like to go back I actually

77
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:37,390
have a book that I forgot to bring up

78
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:38,920
here it's like the fundamentals of

79
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:41,739
computer security from 1994 and it

80
00:03:41,739 --> 00:03:43,360
basically has all the cool in it

81
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,670
that we talked about in security every

82
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:47,320
day like and you know it's been going on

83
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:49,870
forever this principle sort of have

84
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:51,519
existed so I'd like to just kind of

85
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:53,320
remember that what those fundamentals

86
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:55,480
are and then the fact is that when you

87
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:57,220
go to implement things in your

88
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:58,750
application chances are you're going to

89
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:03,070
be looking at or are using these these

90
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:04,660
these concepts or building off of these

91
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:06,670
wrote these building blocks and they may

92
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:08,110
seem simplistic but they're they're

93
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:10,180
they're rather important the first one

94
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:12,900
is confidentiality right confidentiality

95
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:15,580
the security of data in transit and at

96
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:18,700
rest and it's something that that yeah

97
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:21,850
TLS we all know TLS is broken in

98
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:25,180
whatever but anyway so security of data

99
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:27,130
in transit and at rest but I like to

100
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:28,870
think what about in use what about in

101
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:32,770
memory and and one thing about

102
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:35,920
confidentiality that we have to remember

103
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,270
is that sometimes we're running in a

104
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:39,700
shared environment and we do have where

105
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:41,470
we have a sandbox environment Iran is

106
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:43,150
something interesting that just after

107
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:45,040
everyone familiar with heart bleed when

108
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,830
that can always yes so it had a

109
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:49,660
logo in like a website and that's why

110
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:52,660
all you know about it so that's cool uh

111
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:55,660
so after heartbleed I was like how does

112
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:57,190
this how does this impact note what's

113
00:04:57,190 --> 00:04:58,510
with some interesting patterns no and I

114
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:00,640
was like new buffer and so I was like

115
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:03,670
cool buffers aren't zero filled when you

116
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:05,890
when you say new buffer you say new

117
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:07,300
buffer and a link that like you just get

118
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:09,340
some you some cool random data back and

119
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:12,520
I was like John and I were talking after

120
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:15,250
that I was like I want to see this

121
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:18,310
pattern in real life so I started

122
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:19,930
looking at note core know they kind of

123
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:21,610
truncated things and couldn't find any

124
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:22,900
things were but things were being leaked

125
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:25,810
a while back we had a client engagement

126
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:27,310
we actually ran into this in a sandbox

127
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:29,800
environment where you could run new

128
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,900
buffer you just run buffer and just get

129
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:33,310
backed in and you could leak out all

130
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:35,920
kinds of memory and it was fantastic so

131
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,150
I've actually seen this so it's

132
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:38,890
something to know about sub-zero filling

133
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:41,320
buffers if you're not is cool so that's

134
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,540
you know confidentiality of data sort of

135
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:46,510
in use the next one being integrity

136
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:49,300
right so integrity of data being read or

137
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:55,630
written to by a subject who you're how

138
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:57,880
many how many integrity formal integrity

139
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:00,640
models do you think exists everyone from

140
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:08,170
one where is your hand to 33 Matthews

141
00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:10,150
right there's probably more but there's

142
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:12,190
there's three this this that are sort of

143
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:14,110
like the famous ones there's a model

144
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:16,240
called the bib amodel and the bell la

145
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,740
Padula model in the Clark Wilson

146
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:19,240
integrity model there's freaking

147
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,190
mathematical models about integrity that

148
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:22,780
exist that have existed for years and

149
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:25,330
years and years about about applying

150
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:27,400
integrity to your application a subject

151
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,530
and identified subject that you can

152
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:32,200
proof is an authenticated subject it

153
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,330
there's there's rules for reading or

154
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:35,800
writing depending on a higher and

155
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,930
level or lower integrity level if you

156
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:39,729
need to go implement these things those

157
00:06:39,729 --> 00:06:41,740
models already exist and now you know

158
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:42,849
about them and I'm not going explain

159
00:06:42,849 --> 00:06:44,259
them anymore you can look them up and

160
00:06:44,259 --> 00:06:48,970
there's math so one thing with integrity

161
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:50,560
that we find and something we're finding

162
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,879
a lot in the engagements that we're

163
00:06:51,879 --> 00:06:53,530
doing in the modules that we're testing

164
00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:55,870
and assessing is it input validation is

165
00:06:55,870 --> 00:07:00,009
just you know sort of crap and there's a

166
00:07:00,009 --> 00:07:03,009
good module there's joy joins a great

167
00:07:03,009 --> 00:07:04,150
module it's the best long-term that i

168
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:05,349
found i think to do just input

169
00:07:05,349 --> 00:07:10,870
validations for for typing what oh joy

170
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:14,620
alright so I the other thing the other

171
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:16,360
thing that I've had a kind of a struggle

172
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,099
with with the note security project with

173
00:07:18,099 --> 00:07:20,020
like input validation is let's say you

174
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:21,789
build a tiny composable little module

175
00:07:21,789 --> 00:07:23,530
that that takes in some input and then

176
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:26,440
does a child process exec is that is

177
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:30,389
that vulnerable to command injection yes

178
00:07:30,389 --> 00:07:33,099
depends on the context and so do we

179
00:07:33,099 --> 00:07:35,800
report that as a as a vulnerability to

180
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:39,280
that that project or an advisory on the

181
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:43,000
site or not it all bitch devout the

182
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,380
input should be validator it should be

183
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:46,389
reusing like exact file or something but

184
00:07:46,389 --> 00:07:47,590
something it's just something to think

185
00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:50,590
about if I haven't mentioned this sort

186
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:51,819
of going to be just random musings from

187
00:07:51,819 --> 00:07:55,569
the security guy so availability the

188
00:07:55,569 --> 00:07:58,150
last last sort of of the triad that the

189
00:07:58,150 --> 00:08:00,759
security industry likes to tout as being

190
00:08:00,759 --> 00:08:04,930
the big three availability this is the

191
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:07,509
most a sort of heartfelt aspect of

192
00:08:07,509 --> 00:08:11,050
security like when shits down you feel

193
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:13,840
it when something isn't available or 500

194
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:18,580
you feel it and we have a you know in

195
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:20,110
node we are the you know this async

196
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:21,520
thing just like in the first talk was

197
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,680
mentioned like like you know that's like

198
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,389
the note the node way right well we

199
00:08:25,389 --> 00:08:26,889
still have this event loop that we can

200
00:08:26,889 --> 00:08:29,650
block and if you if you say you know

201
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:31,629
call process next tick recursively a

202
00:08:31,629 --> 00:08:34,990
whole bunch of times that you're going

203
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:36,579
to get the event loop blocked of you if

204
00:08:36,579 --> 00:08:38,349
you call if you have n number of

205
00:08:38,349 --> 00:08:39,940
elements that are passing like a sink

206
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:42,250
parallel you should use a parallel limit

207
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:43,990
instead right you're going to you're

208
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:45,459
going to end up with with availability

209
00:08:45,459 --> 00:08:47,230
problems and that's why it streams are

210
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:48,710
so wonderful and

211
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:49,970
as cool because it can just chug on

212
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:52,580
stuff and never quit but yeah

213
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:54,980
availability is like like it's just

214
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:55,910
something to think about when you're

215
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:57,440
when you're designing the systems that

216
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,320
you're building and there's there's

217
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,720
there's others to like non-repudiation

218
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:04,280
where you can prove that a message was

219
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:06,020
from a person and there's there's these

220
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:08,150
there are these sort of core concepts

221
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:10,760
good resources of course shameless plug

222
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,710
from the security project but Orr has a

223
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:15,230
lot of good stuff however when you go

224
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:16,940
there you're going to see you be like

225
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:21,080
this is PHP wow this is Java why your

226
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,760
flip the table and you like this has

227
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:25,250
nothing to do a node well this you can

228
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:26,960
ignore that fact and try to apply those

229
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:29,780
patterns in node if you do write African

230
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:31,400
blog posts and tell us about it and will

231
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,630
link it so that we start having these

232
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:35,780
patterns showing up in node so with that

233
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:39,110
said we now move on to the ghost of

234
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:42,500
security present after i finished my

235
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,870
master class on the subject of those who

236
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:46,460
cannot remember the past are doomed to

237
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:48,320
repeat it the first ghost disappeared

238
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,920
but i had no sooner return to my task

239
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:54,020
that a great cacophony announced the

240
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:56,180
arrival of another ghost he piled

241
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:57,590
straight into the door frame which would

242
00:09:57,590 --> 00:09:58,840
have hurt if he had been corporal

243
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,860
because he was too busy frantically

244
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:03,140
swiping this laptop he wore a gray

245
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:06,710
hoodie and a paint expression uh hey he

246
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:11,330
said I'm supposed to be here to warn you

247
00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:14,030
about the dream necessities of security

248
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:17,270
present and all that but I I really have

249
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:19,550
no idea what damn problem is or what I'm

250
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:21,740
doing here dude I said glancing laptop I

251
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:25,820
see your problem already you need to

252
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:27,710
actively monitor self-report

253
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:29,570
vulnerabilities and keep up with the

254
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:31,640
community in general you're the ghost of

255
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:34,910
security present right I'm supposed to

256
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:37,160
be he said forlornly well then listen

257
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,510
I'll tell you about it and why it's so

258
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:41,900
important so this is where I go off

259
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:44,060
about the note core security project all

260
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,470
right notes good note core security

261
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:48,620
process I submitted and I would love

262
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:51,290
people to put comments on here this

263
00:10:51,290 --> 00:10:53,630
particular pull request and ask why it

264
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:56,000
hasn't been adopted in core yet this

265
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,860
pull request is six months old I asked

266
00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:02,510
court to adopt a security process

267
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:05,060
in which it basically communicated to

268
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:07,730
you how you would know about when

269
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:12,860
security releases were published and you

270
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:14,000
know maybe how they were going to deal

271
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,790
with like new v8 vulnerabilities and how

272
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:19,760
they're going to pull them in so into

273
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:20,570
how all that was going to be

274
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:23,060
communicated and executed and and so we

275
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:26,000
wouldn't have issues there well there's

276
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,580
nothing official I'm hopeful for I ojs

277
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:30,860
personally given the goals that they've

278
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:33,140
set forth on that which I will be

279
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:35,330
contributing the same damn thing to that

280
00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:39,050
repository as well and you'll respond he

281
00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:42,980
promises right there so this is this is

282
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:45,110
talking about security presence so we

283
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:47,960
talked about past and that and we and so

284
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:50,480
so once you've learned sort of you your

285
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,610
your past things and you you're coming

286
00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:56,150
to present you this is all about keeping

287
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:57,620
up this is all about understanding

288
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:59,150
what's going on in the community and one

289
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:01,400
thing that I wanted to mention with

290
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:04,490
permission is that what NPM is doing mpm

291
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:06,650
is a huge part of our ecosystem and note

292
00:12:06,650 --> 00:12:10,430
right like the majority of like no

293
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:11,930
course cool and everything but like the

294
00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:14,150
majority of the happenings are like it's

295
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:16,190
like the modules the eighty percent of

296
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:17,600
what you're building is is is all

297
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,950
somebody else's modules somebody else

298
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:21,040
code and it runs on this infrastructure

299
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:25,910
by and p.m. and I think just like pile

300
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:29,990
of them are here so that's cool and they

301
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:31,640
actually like you may not know it

302
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:33,340
they've written some blog posts about it

303
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:37,580
they care a very great deal about the

304
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:39,710
security of the infrastructure of that

305
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:42,560
from in terms of availability security

306
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,150
ever since we started working with them

307
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:46,520
even when it was no just just an open

308
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:49,390
source project years ago they've taken a

309
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:53,780
great sort of pains to respond well take

310
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:57,430
action be accountable for security and

311
00:12:57,430 --> 00:13:01,640
that's been through the whole process of

312
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:02,960
how they've built in design stuff

313
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:05,530
through the new the new npm dub dub dub

314
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:08,270
that's gone through extensive auditing

315
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:11,420
and testing from third parties and as

316
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:13,670
well as the new sort of the new registry

317
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:15,950
stuff coming up they care

318
00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:18,500
I deal to make that happen and I think

319
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:21,590
that I guess they should be applauded

320
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:23,150
for that that's that's sort of

321
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:32,630
unprecedented I think so Wow yeah there

322
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:35,150
you go okay so the other thing when

323
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:36,170
you're talking about keeping up with

324
00:13:36,170 --> 00:13:39,410
security present you're talking about

325
00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:40,970
also known vulnerabilities this is sort

326
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:42,320
of the shameless plug for like the node

327
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,000
security project and like understanding

328
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,770
like whose code you're running in

329
00:13:45,770 --> 00:13:48,380
production and is that bad or not if

330
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:49,430
you're not familiar with the note

331
00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:51,230
security project there's basically this

332
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:54,950
tool called nsp that you can install run

333
00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:56,390
against package file a shrink wrap file

334
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:59,570
it'll tell you if there's known known

335
00:13:59,570 --> 00:14:01,340
sort of blacklisted modules if there's

336
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:02,780
things that like this version has a

337
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:05,270
known vulnerability of course you may

338
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:06,260
not have the vulnerable because you're

339
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:08,030
using it differently but it's still this

340
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:09,830
is a good idea right to know about

341
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:11,900
what's what's going on there there's

342
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:13,250
another one I didn't put in here that

343
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:16,070
I'll mention call retire j/s that keeps

344
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:17,420
track of like your client side code abs

345
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:18,680
is your angular version out of date

346
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:19,970
using some stupid helper that's

347
00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:21,860
vulnerable those things that's really

348
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:26,000
good another way that I personally keep

349
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,540
up with things going on with my

350
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:31,640
dependencies my dependencies happen to

351
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:33,590
be the entire module base that's an NPM

352
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:35,110
because of the note security project I

353
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:40,100
wrote an app basically to keep track of

354
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:43,100
all of the issues in github and check

355
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:45,980
them for keywords so keep up on your

356
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:48,500
projects know when security-related

357
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,810
issues are opened we do this and

358
00:14:50,810 --> 00:14:53,180
constantly monitor it so we so we get

359
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:56,540
feedback so that's that's some things to

360
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:58,070
just sort of keep up on the community

361
00:14:58,070 --> 00:14:59,300
things that are going out on the

362
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:03,680
community with security so after the

363
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,180
ghost of security present take me friend

364
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:08,120
departed I began to grow anxious after

365
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:10,400
all I'd seen this movie before and I

366
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,140
knew what was coming next the room

367
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:15,260
darkened and a mist like a Kirby gantu

368
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:17,630
drift across the floor a figure who

369
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:20,330
looked not altogether unlike myself

370
00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:23,150
although it looks more like a Mel Gibson

371
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:27,020
Sifford emerged from the shadows his

372
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:29,540
face shadowed by a great hood in

373
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:37,820
handheld sit sighs he intoned gliding

374
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:40,779
towards me in an unearthly gate

375
00:15:40,779 --> 00:15:44,029
don'tdon't uh-huh I've comfort with fell

376
00:15:44,029 --> 00:15:46,040
tidings no matter what you do no matter

377
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,750
how you could try to prepare for the

378
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:50,720
unexpected you can't for every seven

379
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,240
layers of security you set up eight will

380
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:55,970
be hacked for every vulnerability find

381
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:57,350
10 more shall spring up in their place

382
00:15:57,350 --> 00:15:59,720
lament mortal for there's no way to

383
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:02,170
prepare for the unprepared ball yeah

384
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:06,440
that's kind of I said so yea

385
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:10,399
thou shalt wait what so it's true you

386
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:11,899
can you can't prepare for everything but

387
00:16:11,899 --> 00:16:13,310
security necessarily isn't about that

388
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:16,370
you can't it's not just going to happen

389
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:19,279
when you try to predict everything it's

390
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:20,630
more about doing everything you can to

391
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:24,130
set people up for success uh here listen

392
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:30,199
so the ghost says the ghost says you

393
00:16:30,199 --> 00:16:32,870
can't you know keep up with with

394
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:33,829
security you can't predict the future

395
00:16:33,829 --> 00:16:37,250
that's true like you can do all of these

396
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:39,079
great things in security and you're

397
00:16:39,079 --> 00:16:40,730
still going to make a mistake we're

398
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:43,730
still human uh that's fine that's that's

399
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:45,800
that's that's what it's about security

400
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:48,290
is a process it's not a destination it's

401
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:50,600
that the Penrose stairs where you're

402
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,220
just going to kind of keep climbing and

403
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:53,449
climbing climbing climbing climbing

404
00:16:53,449 --> 00:16:55,010
forever and just incrementally get

405
00:16:55,010 --> 00:16:56,750
better that's what it's all about it's

406
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:59,899
about applying security and every single

407
00:16:59,899 --> 00:17:01,490
one of these steps in your design phase

408
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:03,019
your build phase you deploy phase and

409
00:17:03,019 --> 00:17:04,669
your test phase your production and

410
00:17:04,669 --> 00:17:06,860
monitoring if you're if you're if the

411
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:08,209
only thing you're doing is hiring a

412
00:17:08,209 --> 00:17:09,829
company to do pen testing and catching

413
00:17:09,829 --> 00:17:11,809
your security bugs in production you're

414
00:17:11,809 --> 00:17:14,089
doing it wrong sure I love the business

415
00:17:14,089 --> 00:17:15,709
but no you're doing it wrong you have to

416
00:17:15,709 --> 00:17:17,870
push if to take that advice and start

417
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:19,370
pushing it back towards the developers

418
00:17:19,370 --> 00:17:21,740
pushing it back towards the the the

419
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:24,470
front end of your cycle the other thing

420
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:25,730
I'm going to harp on is audit logging

421
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:29,059
it's not done well enough I don't think

422
00:17:29,059 --> 00:17:32,150
in the majority of applications and

423
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:34,150
settings and traditionally what I hear

424
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:37,070
in larger enterprises out here that's an

425
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:39,860
ops problem let ops worry about

426
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:41,929
monitoring and detection we just built

427
00:17:41,929 --> 00:17:43,340
an app they run it

428
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:46,610
that's right what you have to

429
00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:48,650
enable them as a developer you have to

430
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:51,350
give them the who did what when and what

431
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:52,880
was the result you have to enable them

432
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,680
to have the tool they have the data to

433
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,510
make the to make the decisions if you're

434
00:17:56,510 --> 00:17:59,020
going to put that burden onto them and

435
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:03,680
lastly run fire drills that one of the

436
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,510
biggest things you can do is just sit

437
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:07,670
down and have that that sort of silly

438
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:09,770
theoretical discussion that fire drill

439
00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:12,680
of what happened if this was abused what

440
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:13,760
would happen if this was unavailable

441
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,800
what would happen if this was hacked how

442
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:18,260
would we respond to clients what logs

443
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:19,910
would we need what would we have to

444
00:18:19,910 --> 00:18:22,340
access how would we respond if you do

445
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:24,500
that you're going to stop trying to

446
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:25,940
predict the future and you're going to

447
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:27,950
start implementing those controls back

448
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:30,890
now and have an ability sort of to

449
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:33,590
respond to those future events I'll use

450
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:37,760
the word future proof I guess so with

451
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,040
that the last ghost departed and

452
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:42,470
although I had imparted knowledge unto

453
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:45,590
each of them I felt that I learned a

454
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:47,930
great lesson myself about what's

455
00:18:47,930 --> 00:18:49,580
important and what's not when it comes

456
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:52,600
to the great mystery that is security

457
00:18:52,600 --> 00:19:01,060
the end Mike Spiegel wrote all that

458
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:04,850
Jamie rofls Robles did all the art and

459
00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:10,310
Ben hacker did puppet thingies so thanks
