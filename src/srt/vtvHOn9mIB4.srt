1
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:43,609

yeah so my name is David Calhoun as you

2
00:00:43,609 --> 00:00:45,379
can read my talk is real-time satellite

3
00:00:45,379 --> 00:00:47,780
tracking in the browser and not real

4
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:50,030
time in the sense as a last talk but

5
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:52,160
real time is that in that it's updating

6
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,920
and you can get the current location but

7
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:57,890
not like the two-way you know nice data

8
00:00:57,890 --> 00:01:00,260
binding as described in the last time

9
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:03,649
but it's cool stuff I'm doing some basic

10
00:01:03,649 --> 00:01:05,750
JavaScript I'm not doing anything with

11
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:08,540
emoji or anything like that so as people

12
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:12,290
walk out the doors and so started

13
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:15,259
disappoint you but yeah I work at a

14
00:01:15,259 --> 00:01:17,479
place called skybox imaging and they

15
00:01:17,479 --> 00:01:19,009
wanted me to show you this fancy slide

16
00:01:19,009 --> 00:01:20,390
with a bunch of numbers and dollar signs

17
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:22,399
and stuff I just wanted to say like yeah

18
00:01:22,399 --> 00:01:23,840
we launched a satellite last year which

19
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,030
is pretty cool a microsatellite and

20
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:27,890
we're in a launch one soon this year

21
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:30,259
that's all I want to say so skip it okay

22
00:01:30,259 --> 00:01:34,040
so as for products we sell some cool

23
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:37,909
stuff we call these sky nodes on the

24
00:01:37,909 --> 00:01:39,950
very left side and we sell that to

25
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:42,259
customers who you know are interested in

26
00:01:42,259 --> 00:01:44,390
talking directly to our satellites and

27
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:46,880
actually processing images on server

28
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,520
racks that they actually own and control

29
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:50,990
pretty cool so and we saw the imagery

30
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:52,610
and video and of course we have like an

31
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:55,009
analytics component of all of that it's

32
00:01:55,009 --> 00:01:57,289
cool we have the right and mountain to

33
00:01:57,289 --> 00:01:59,359
view we have a clean room where we

34
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:00,950
constructed the satellites one of those

35
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:03,020
is in space know which is pretty crazy

36
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:05,450
to think about pretty smart people work

37
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:07,670
in there and as just a front end or UI

38
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:09,470
engineer I tend to think like at places

39
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:11,599
like this I'm overwhelmed by the amount

40
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:13,340
of intelligence in the room but I'm also

41
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:14,270
overwhelmed at sky

42
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:15,530
box because we have basically like

43
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:17,620
rocket scientists and they talk about

44
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:19,910
words I've never heard before and have

45
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:21,680
to go look them up and everything so

46
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,950
it's very very humbling very educational

47
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:27,710
experience we have this mission

48
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:29,000
operation center which is right in

49
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,340
Mountain View to and the screen in the

50
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:32,780
very back of the room actually I helped

51
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:34,460
develop that when I first joined skybox

52
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:36,500
it's a telemetry dashboard so it's

53
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:37,580
pretty awesome to see them actually

54
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:39,920
using that to to monitor communications

55
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,810
with the satellite as it makes it past

56
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:46,190
about every 90 minutes yeah and here's

57
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:48,590
some cool stuff like color infrared and

58
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:54,340
then we have this which is where is it

59
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:57,400
it's a little bit of a special slide

60
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:01,640
there goes so that's actually not an

61
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:04,850
image that's actually a video of the

62
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:06,890
tallest building in the world as a plane

63
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:08,900
flies by in the front so that's pretty

64
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:11,510
amazing and that's real parallax there

65
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:13,370
it's not parallax scrolling or anything

66
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:15,980
like that so i have to say these corny

67
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:19,130
jokes and i have to say we're hiring so

68
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:21,020
but i don't want to take too much time

69
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:23,480
Zanna but as a UI engineer I get to work

70
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,970
on cool stuff so I won't spend too much

71
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:27,320
time doing this I already mentioned the

72
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:29,750
telemetry dashboard some of these are

73
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:32,270
mapped based so it's actually quite

74
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:34,340
useful to understand some of the orbital

75
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:36,740
adji and the orbital mechanics mechanics

76
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:38,900
concepts behind the scenes even if I

77
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:41,240
don't fully understand the math which I

78
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:43,760
don't I could actually I could get the

79
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,620
words and get the terminology and just

80
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:47,300
to understand that is a huge leap so

81
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:49,550
we'll see a little bit of those concepts

82
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:52,220
in this but nothing too crazy no heavy

83
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:55,070
math so my goal is like to actually like

84
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:56,750
present something that everyone will be

85
00:03:56,750 --> 00:04:00,110
able to understand and build and yeah I

86
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:02,690
gave a link to the to the to the talk

87
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:04,730
actually online so do a search for Jas

88
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:08,150
conf yeah and one of mine will be on the

89
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:10,190
top live upload the slides I've also

90
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:11,959
uploaded like step-by-step so you can

91
00:04:11,959 --> 00:04:14,000
actually take this home and and do it

92
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,209
yourself nothing too crazy going on so I

93
00:04:17,209 --> 00:04:19,480
just want to step backwards literally

94
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:22,729
for like 50 years actually over 50 years

95
00:04:22,729 --> 00:04:24,470
ago so you're standing in your backyard

96
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:26,340
enjoying the dark black

97
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:30,000
sky the night sky um that's supposed to

98
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,210
happen that's okay you know it's very

99
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:35,270
early in the morning or late at night

100
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:38,190
and you tune your ham radio into the

101
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:41,160
right frequency and you know you look up

102
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,630
and you see this thing going across the

103
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:45,500
sky and you hear this do I have audio oh

104
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,880
I don't know if we can all hear this but

105
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:54,960
you hear this strange sound I should

106
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,699
have checked the audio first anyway it's

107
00:04:56,699 --> 00:04:58,950
this telemetry signal for something

108
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:00,870
strange out there what the heck is that

109
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:04,169
its 19th years 1957 who knows the name

110
00:05:04,169 --> 00:05:08,130
of what it is Sputnik exactly so this

111
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:10,020
guy this little unimpressive guy and

112
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:11,340
that's his only job to send that

113
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:13,530
telemetry signal out and from the

114
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:16,350
comfort of your own backyard in America

115
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:18,020
or wherever you are you can see this

116
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:21,389
soviet-built satellite go up across you

117
00:05:21,389 --> 00:05:23,100
can see this and potentially it can see

118
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:24,510
you it doesn't have any optics or

119
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:26,960
anything in the middle of the Cold War

120
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:30,360
freaky as hell like this you know this

121
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,220
thing that could be an ICBM it could

122
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:34,530
have some nuclear payload is going right

123
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:37,530
right over your backyard literally so

124
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:40,050
it's somehow you know it's like all of a

125
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:41,970
sudden suddenly becomes quite important

126
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:44,880
to know like what is this thing and can

127
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,680
I actually track where it's going to be

128
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,840
tomorrow and the next day where is it

129
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,880
where is it going to orbit over that

130
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,520
suddenly becomes important and it

131
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:57,150
becomes early front-page news so if you

132
00:05:57,150 --> 00:05:58,500
want to know if you want to keep up

133
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,630
today this is your main source as an

134
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:03,840
amateur you know person who has interest

135
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,490
in this and actually back then everyone

136
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:07,169
who hadn't had an interest in this

137
00:06:07,169 --> 00:06:10,620
because it's quite important and you get

138
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,539
this one orbit track line it shows you

139
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:15,450
okay there's the satellite but that's

140
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:17,400
not quite hopeful it's like okay at one

141
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:20,610
point in time sometime yesterday or

142
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:22,020
something like that there's where the

143
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:24,300
satellite was well where is it right now

144
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:26,160
you know isn't that more useful so you

145
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,229
keep up-to-date you look you checking

146
00:06:28,229 --> 00:06:29,849
another newspaper and you see this thing

147
00:06:29,849 --> 00:06:32,000
that gives you more details sorry okay

148
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,820
the satellite is going to cross the 40th

149
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:37,979
parallel at these times which is

150
00:06:37,979 --> 00:06:39,030
relevant for a mare

151
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:41,400
so it's like at those times you know you

152
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,630
can potentially go out in your backyard

153
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:45,840
and the Soviets were where they were

154
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,250
honest and saying if you had a cheap

155
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:49,260
pair of binoculars and you point in just

156
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:51,360
the right area extremely difficult but

157
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,190
you could actually see it or you could

158
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:54,630
see it with your eyes reflect off the

159
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:56,850
Sun if it was just the right right

160
00:06:56,850 --> 00:07:00,180
timing but that's all you had at you as

161
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:02,790
your resources as an amateur you had to

162
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:05,670
rely on the newspaper so like we can't

163
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:07,920
really do that nowadays when we launch

164
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,240
our satellites and newspapers don't

165
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,530
really care there's a bunch of space

166
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:12,210
debris floating around up there people

167
00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:13,620
you know newspapers aren't really

168
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:15,750
excited this is just because it was the

169
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:17,520
first time and it was especially

170
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:21,210
relevant for the Cold War so let's

171
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:24,840
fast-forward back 20 about last year in

172
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:33,230
November so should have Oh Dan play

173
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:38,120
there we go oh crap it's an ICBM

174
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:41,810
actually it's a decommissioned ICBM oh

175
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:45,270
stop playing ah it's a decommissioned

176
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:47,580
ICBM that's actually used for commercial

177
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:49,920
purposes and our satellite went up on

178
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:50,850
this with a bunch of other

179
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:53,970
microsatellites and someone in my

180
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:55,830
company had a good point they said that

181
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:58,560
the Russians former Soviets actually

182
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,330
turn into great capitalists because I

183
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:03,000
realized that they had all these ICBMs

184
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,320
lying around and they took out the

185
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:07,290
nuclear payload basically made contracts

186
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:08,760
with countries and companies and

187
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,650
realized I could profit like crazy off

188
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:12,630
of this so turned out to be fortuitous

189
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:16,170
on both sides so pretty amazing that we

190
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:18,750
came from the blaze of Sputnik and then

191
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:20,160
into the present day where were actually

192
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:24,180
passed the Cold War and actually doing

193
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:26,310
useful things with this in commercial

194
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:28,200
things with this but the goal is still

195
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,300
the same it's like back then you know I

196
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:32,340
was working on a project it happened to

197
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:34,170
be a map-based project that had orbit

198
00:08:34,170 --> 00:08:36,450
lines and everything but I really wanted

199
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:38,970
to know ok how difficult is it for

200
00:08:38,970 --> 00:08:41,760
someone like someone normal reasonably

201
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,280
normal like me who doesn't know a lot of

202
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:47,970
math who knows basic well some

203
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:49,710
JavaScript and can put some stuff

204
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:51,360
together and mash things together how

205
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,779
difficult is that so

206
00:08:52,779 --> 00:08:54,579
I became my goal as sort of like a hack

207
00:08:54,579 --> 00:08:58,209
date project my goal is to plot this the

208
00:08:58,209 --> 00:09:00,310
current position of sky SAT one which is

209
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:02,800
the name of our satellite stick it on a

210
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:06,399
map okay let's see how far we can go so

211
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:09,339
first we need a map that's useful we

212
00:09:09,339 --> 00:09:10,779
could use Google Maps that's another

213
00:09:10,779 --> 00:09:12,970
option we happen to use leaflet j/s

214
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:14,439
which is a little more flexible it's

215
00:09:14,439 --> 00:09:16,689
like a nice alternative very

216
00:09:16,689 --> 00:09:18,699
customizable and this is what you get

217
00:09:18,699 --> 00:09:20,079
straight out of the box in this pretty

218
00:09:20,079 --> 00:09:21,910
plain looking map with some zoom

219
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:25,029
controls nothing too fancy the code for

220
00:09:25,029 --> 00:09:27,040
this is pretty simple I copied it

221
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,689
straight out of there tutorial so

222
00:09:28,689 --> 00:09:30,610
there's nothing fancy going on here I

223
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:32,889
set a latitude longitude which is just 0

224
00:09:32,889 --> 00:09:35,559
0 to make it simple set a zoom level if

225
00:09:35,559 --> 00:09:37,329
you've ever used google maps it's the

226
00:09:37,329 --> 00:09:39,309
same concept zoom of one just happens to

227
00:09:39,309 --> 00:09:41,740
be completely zoomed out widest angle

228
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:44,589
possible and then we add a tile layer

229
00:09:44,589 --> 00:09:46,360
which which happens to be open street

230
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,370
map tiles and then that's what we get

231
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:51,579
out of it okay that's all well and good

232
00:09:51,579 --> 00:09:54,279
but so we want to customize the tiles

233
00:09:54,279 --> 00:09:56,970
and I don't like those colors maybe ok

234
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:59,649
we have an option to use matte box tiles

235
00:09:59,649 --> 00:10:01,360
so matte box is a service that takes

236
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,120
those open street maps and and lets you

237
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:06,639
customize it puts tiles on it not as

238
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:08,949
simple as sort of like putting CSS

239
00:10:08,949 --> 00:10:10,720
Styles on it but they help you with a

240
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,850
little interface you can customize it

241
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:14,470
you can go crazy you can do whatever you

242
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:17,470
want with the colors on here as an

243
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:19,149
example which something I wouldn't

244
00:10:19,149 --> 00:10:23,649
recommend hello kitty theme if you're

245
00:10:23,649 --> 00:10:25,329
really into hello kitty oh that looks

246
00:10:25,329 --> 00:10:27,699
term okay well anyway that's hello kitty

247
00:10:27,699 --> 00:10:30,009
colors you can go crazy and customize it

248
00:10:30,009 --> 00:10:31,689
it's up to it's up to your whim

249
00:10:31,689 --> 00:10:34,449
basically it's pretty simple you log in

250
00:10:34,449 --> 00:10:36,309
and create an account you get a free

251
00:10:36,309 --> 00:10:38,290
account to play around with you could

252
00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:40,929
you say create a project which ends up

253
00:10:40,929 --> 00:10:42,850
being your satellite tracker map and you

254
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:46,000
get an API key there so that just

255
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,839
happens to be my key so I copy and paste

256
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:52,749
it and paste it into my in it code so

257
00:10:52,749 --> 00:10:54,759
now I can take out the actual vanilla

258
00:10:54,759 --> 00:10:57,459
leaflet JavaScript include dump in Matt

259
00:10:57,459 --> 00:10:59,230
boxes which is actually like a wrapper

260
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:01,179
around leaflet so it takes care of

261
00:11:01,179 --> 00:11:03,129
everything for you it's still leaflet

262
00:11:03,129 --> 00:11:05,290
but with some extra functions on it and

263
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:07,540
mapbox titles which is sweet so I can

264
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:10,149
customize it the initialization is

265
00:11:10,149 --> 00:11:12,100
pretty much the same a little simpler

266
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:14,740
passing my api api key and i'm still

267
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:17,110
passing in the latin that long and the

268
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:21,519
zoom level so okay not too crazy so we

269
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:26,259
have our map now we probably want to put

270
00:11:26,259 --> 00:11:28,329
a custom icon on there for our satellite

271
00:11:28,329 --> 00:11:30,220
so I just grabbed a little icon of

272
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:32,620
that's roughly what sky SAT one looks

273
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:35,019
like with this door open it pops open

274
00:11:35,019 --> 00:11:38,230
when it's in space and points down and

275
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:41,079
it's hovering over a location it's kind

276
00:11:41,079 --> 00:11:43,420
of somewhere in northern Florida have no

277
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:45,519
idea where that would be probably around

278
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:48,490
here so i just took the latitude

279
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:51,160
longitude from amelia island plugged it

280
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:53,110
in there and then you can do it with

281
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:55,240
this don't let this frighten you if

282
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,709
you're new to java script or anything

283
00:11:56,709 --> 00:11:58,959
it's super simple there's a basic

284
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:00,970
example at the top so you can say i just

285
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:02,769
want to put like the default leaflet map

286
00:12:02,769 --> 00:12:04,720
marker on there at this latitude

287
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,449
longitude add it to my damn map and get

288
00:12:07,449 --> 00:12:09,490
it over with or you can say well i want

289
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:11,709
a custom icon so you can specify the

290
00:12:11,709 --> 00:12:13,779
path you know there's even one now for

291
00:12:13,779 --> 00:12:16,839
the retina or you know high quality

292
00:12:16,839 --> 00:12:19,560
displays high pixel density displays

293
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:22,779
specify the icon size and then the

294
00:12:22,779 --> 00:12:25,779
anchor point is actually where you want

295
00:12:25,779 --> 00:12:28,120
to position where you want to map the

296
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,399
latitude longitude relative to your

297
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:32,260
actual icon in this case we're just

298
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:34,540
putting it smack dab in the center some

299
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:35,800
cases you might want to put it on the

300
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,930
upper left or so forth but keeping it

301
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:42,339
simple now ok all set I think we got

302
00:12:42,339 --> 00:12:44,410
everything we need right I'll know what

303
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:47,649
actually ok we're kind of missing some

304
00:12:47,649 --> 00:12:49,660
things we're missing math some

305
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:52,660
astrophysics probably missing some more

306
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:53,760
math in there just for good measure

307
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:56,139
probably should throw that in there so

308
00:12:56,139 --> 00:12:58,300
we it turns out we actually have to

309
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:01,600
backtrack a bit just to give you the

310
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,540
concepts we have to do the fastest orbit

311
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:06,430
ology crash course in the history and

312
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:08,589
probably not one of the best but that's

313
00:13:08,589 --> 00:13:09,910
cool because you'll get a better

314
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:11,380
understanding of what's going on with

315
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:14,589
this math that we're going to use so way

316
00:13:14,589 --> 00:13:16,630
back when when the earth was the center

317
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:17,640
of the universe

318
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:22,290
at least philosophically they actually

319
00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:24,480
made the math work but with these crazy

320
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,850
epicycle things which end up looking

321
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:29,460
like little spirograph points so this

322
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:31,860
actually was a functional mathematically

323
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:34,980
like functional working model to predict

324
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:38,220
positions of planets and so forth but

325
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:39,510
they knew something was messed up

326
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:42,660
obviously you know the thing that they

327
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:44,580
have a philosophy that things in the

328
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:46,590
heavens were perfect it comes from

329
00:13:46,590 --> 00:13:48,180
philosophy it's like the heavenly

330
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:50,100
spheres and things they're all perfect

331
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:52,410
circles perfect spheres obviously this

332
00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:54,540
model doesn't have those perfect circles

333
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:55,650
in it so something is wrong with the

334
00:13:55,650 --> 00:13:57,780
model but hey the math works so we'll

335
00:13:57,780 --> 00:14:00,330
stick with it for about a thousand years

336
00:14:00,330 --> 00:14:06,030
or so or longer so until Copernicus

337
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:08,550
comes along and actually the Greek way

338
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:10,530
before him actually believed in a

339
00:14:10,530 --> 00:14:12,920
heliocentric Sun standard model of

340
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:15,600
everything but the the heliocentric

341
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,670
model actually rectified some of that

342
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:22,020
math so jumping past there took until

343
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:25,590
Kepler Kepler's first law says okay well

344
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:27,120
actually these orbits that go around the

345
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,310
Sun aren't perfect circle's turns out

346
00:14:29,310 --> 00:14:30,660
the heavens aren't perfect after all

347
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:33,150
sorry to break the news to their slight

348
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:35,280
ellipses they're slight when you look at

349
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:36,960
them it looks almost like perfect

350
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,490
circles but they're slightly ellipses

351
00:14:38,490 --> 00:14:40,020
and that makes the math work a little

352
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:42,690
better but we still can't make the

353
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:44,550
predictions we can't plug in numbers and

354
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,650
predict the position of where will this

355
00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:48,750
be at this point in time that took until

356
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:51,180
Newton and it Newton has something

357
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:54,950
called the two body two body problem

358
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:59,460
okay then so Newton solved for the math

359
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:01,380
for this I took out as much of the math

360
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:02,790
as I could on here there's still a

361
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:04,560
little bit but I took out the formulas

362
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,990
mean basically solved for this and made

363
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:08,820
this work so in this case we can say

364
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:10,950
okay the blue thing in the middle is the

365
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:13,230
earth and that sky SAT one around there

366
00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:15,270
so he did the math for that and that

367
00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:17,550
math is actually very elegant works very

368
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:19,770
well in a system when there's only two

369
00:15:19,770 --> 00:15:22,860
bodies but there's a problem that's not

370
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:24,750
actually reflective of reality there's

371
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:28,050
no actual to body system everything is

372
00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:29,130
connected to each other gravitationally

373
00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:30,850
everything's affecting each

374
00:15:30,850 --> 00:15:32,889
there it turns out to be a huge problem

375
00:15:32,889 --> 00:15:34,990
with the math and it makes things a

376
00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:37,089
little crazy it's what they're called

377
00:15:37,089 --> 00:15:38,920
it's what's called perturbations to the

378
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:41,560
orbit basically perturbations are things

379
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:43,569
that affect that two body problem and

380
00:15:43,569 --> 00:15:46,660
the big things would be like the Sun the

381
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:49,329
Moon the earth even the virtue of the

382
00:15:49,329 --> 00:15:51,399
earth be no blade which is not a perfect

383
00:15:51,399 --> 00:15:54,100
sphere an oblate spheroid it actually

384
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:56,170
affects that it's actually measured as a

385
00:15:56,170 --> 00:15:58,420
perturbation in itself it could be like

386
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:01,149
atmospheric drag little comets that go

387
00:16:01,149 --> 00:16:04,300
by everything is related to it so so in

388
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:06,190
reality we actually have an N body

389
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:08,410
problem there's so many things flying

390
00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:10,389
around out there they have an effect on

391
00:16:10,389 --> 00:16:12,430
this and if we want a perfect model we

392
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:14,259
have to throw all of those into the math

393
00:16:14,259 --> 00:16:16,540
into the perturbations formula which I

394
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:18,759
don't know how to do I'm not that good

395
00:16:18,759 --> 00:16:20,889
at math and it's literally like rocket

396
00:16:20,889 --> 00:16:23,740
science so not a lot of people can do

397
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:25,329
this but there's books about it and you

398
00:16:25,329 --> 00:16:27,579
can get the concepts so what's useful

399
00:16:27,579 --> 00:16:29,860
for us is that we have the what's called

400
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:32,649
this simplified perturbations model

401
00:16:32,649 --> 00:16:37,329
which is abbreviated as sgp for and the

402
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:38,439
formulas for these were actually

403
00:16:38,439 --> 00:16:40,120
released in the 80s i think it was right

404
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:43,779
in 1980 originally in fortran which

405
00:16:43,779 --> 00:16:45,730
shows you about how old that is it's

406
00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:47,980
been ported to so many things since then

407
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:51,250
to Joe about to see to MATLAB even and

408
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:53,290
of course now it's in JavaScript people

409
00:16:53,290 --> 00:16:57,040
have poured it to JavaScript and when I

410
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:00,329
say simplified you know maybe it's like

411
00:17:00,329 --> 00:17:02,980
someone's concept of simplified but that

412
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:04,510
does not appear to me to be like

413
00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:06,549
simplified it's it's scary stuff

414
00:17:06,549 --> 00:17:09,429
happening and yeah this is from

415
00:17:09,429 --> 00:17:11,650
satellite jas so this is a port this is

416
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:13,480
just a glimpse into the file of what's

417
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:16,150
actually going on and they left the

418
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:18,069
comments intact it actually at the top

419
00:17:18,069 --> 00:17:20,079
of the code blocks it still has comments

420
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:22,480
from the procedures from the fortran

421
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:25,360
code and from the port to c plus bus so

422
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:27,730
it's been ported like crazy and every

423
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:29,710
time it gets ported it has a run it has

424
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:31,299
a series of tests that you can test it

425
00:17:31,299 --> 00:17:33,250
against to make sure that the math is

426
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:35,110
still preserved even though it's you

427
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:37,510
know actually I like a port but it's

428
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:39,610
pretty it looks pretty crazy the good

429
00:17:39,610 --> 00:17:41,380
news is someone has already ported that

430
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:43,419
and we could theoretically interface to

431
00:17:43,419 --> 00:17:44,070
it in

432
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:47,070
easy way which we can but we need inputs

433
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:50,070
for those functions so the sgp for gives

434
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:52,110
us the functions we still need to put

435
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:55,080
inputs into it and what we use it as

436
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:57,930
inputs are these things called tles so

437
00:17:57,930 --> 00:18:00,210
there are two line element sets and I

438
00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:02,100
show a picture of a punch card which i

439
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:04,500
also saw way earlier this morning at the

440
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,900
beginning of the day oh this is where

441
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:09,180
they originated in punch card land and

442
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:11,130
then in this in the age of mainframe

443
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:12,600
computers that were churning and

444
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:15,390
processing out all these calculations it

445
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:17,700
turns out we still use the same format

446
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:20,130
so even when we get to JavaScript land

447
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:21,930
when we ported everything all the way

448
00:18:21,930 --> 00:18:24,450
through the tle still preserves the same

449
00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:26,700
format as the punch card it actually

450
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:29,490
things are spaced out exactly where

451
00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:32,460
they've been for so long like you know

452
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:35,040
decades and decades so it actually the

453
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:37,320
format exactly resembles it which is

454
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:41,940
pretty cool yeah so and what i'm doing

455
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:44,250
here is i'm basically saying okay the

456
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:46,560
tle gives us some information about the

457
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:48,810
satellite at a certain point of time and

458
00:18:48,810 --> 00:18:51,090
because this is a simplified model the

459
00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:53,940
math actually deviates over time so when

460
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:56,340
you have a tle for a certain day it's

461
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:58,740
been updated you get the updated tle you

462
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:01,650
plug it into the system that the math is

463
00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:03,510
going to deviate a little if there's

464
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:05,610
going to be some drift day by day so you

465
00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:07,290
after you have to keep the TL ease up to

466
00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:10,170
date and there's a place online where

467
00:19:10,170 --> 00:19:11,550
you can get these for free called

468
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:13,560
Celeste track actually if you just do a

469
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:16,500
search for any satellite like your

470
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,780
favorite satellite on Google like sky

471
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:21,630
SAT one tle or ISS for International

472
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:23,850
Space Station TLD they'll have tles that

473
00:19:23,850 --> 00:19:26,280
get updated very frequently because

474
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:29,340
everyone plugs them in to their sgp for

475
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:33,150
a models you know and they and this is

476
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:35,700
useful information it shows us the parts

477
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:37,740
of the it shows us a little bit about

478
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:39,960
the orbit what's called eccentricity

479
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:42,180
inclination all these things you could

480
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:43,410
look up I'm not going to explain it

481
00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:45,300
eccentricity is interesting one it

482
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:47,340
actually tells you how far does that

483
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:50,070
orbit deviate from a perfect circle so

484
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:52,470
there's there's no perfect circles of

485
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:54,570
course but there's there also there's

486
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:56,610
crazy orbits like for spy satellites

487
00:19:56,610 --> 00:19:57,020
that

488
00:19:57,020 --> 00:20:00,350
actually are hugely eccentric actually

489
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:02,960
the orbit goes way out here and it comes

490
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,700
when it comes back around the earth it

491
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:06,380
gets quite close to the earth and the

492
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:08,660
purpose is exactly for spying purposes

493
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:12,080
that is one purpose it goes with the

494
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:14,540
weight of the heck around comes swings

495
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:16,400
around really fast close to the earth

496
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,410
and comes out again so that number would

497
00:20:18,410 --> 00:20:21,260
be quite different but yeah that gives

498
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:24,050
you an idea of what those represent I do

499
00:20:24,050 --> 00:20:25,700
have a little tool down there I have a

500
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:27,410
link to it so you can check it out after

501
00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:29,690
but I do have a tool that kind of helps

502
00:20:29,690 --> 00:20:31,700
you like educate yourself about how the

503
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:34,190
others breaks down the first line turns

504
00:20:34,190 --> 00:20:35,600
out to be more descriptive it doesn't

505
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,980
change much it tells you what the

506
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:40,190
satellite number is like the year it was

507
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:44,270
launched is that 1366 is that is the

508
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:46,670
number of the launch for that year see

509
00:20:46,670 --> 00:20:49,100
is the piece of that launch so we were

510
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:51,500
also launched with Dubai sad and some

511
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,060
other satellites that have a different

512
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:55,670
number they might be B or D or something

513
00:20:55,670 --> 00:21:00,050
like that 14 is the is the year that the

514
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:02,180
tle was generated so it's in this year

515
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:05,450
and then one 48.1 77 it's a fractional

516
00:21:05,450 --> 00:21:07,970
number for what day of the year is it

517
00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:10,760
out of 365 days so it's quite

518
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:12,620
descriptive and you can see when it gets

519
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:15,980
out of date by you know check-in that so

520
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:18,290
that's our input that's what we need we

521
00:21:18,290 --> 00:21:19,820
have all the raw materials and we just

522
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,920
have to mash them together now we really

523
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:23,420
like standing on the shoulders of giants

524
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:26,810
so now at this point okay we plug them

525
00:21:26,810 --> 00:21:29,660
into our functions so we need to get sgp

526
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:33,830
sgp for functions in JavaScript and we

527
00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:35,780
have a couple options I found these two

528
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:37,340
main ones there's this one thing called

529
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:41,360
i SAT which is a nice NASA based

530
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:45,050
satellite viewer the end result of it is

531
00:21:45,050 --> 00:21:48,860
actually a WebGL based nice 3d globe and

532
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:51,170
it plots the position of any satellite

533
00:21:51,170 --> 00:21:53,750
on there I didn't use it because it's

534
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:57,710
not like a standalone sgp for library

535
00:21:57,710 --> 00:21:59,960
it's actually and it's not actually an

536
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:02,000
active development it has a lot of tests

537
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,440
and it looks like everything's pretty

538
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:06,110
pretty accurate but it's like okay it's

539
00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:08,780
just not in development now so I kind of

540
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:09,770
want to keep my hands off

541
00:22:09,770 --> 00:22:12,010
that and i am using satellite Jase

542
00:22:12,010 --> 00:22:14,090
alternatively because it's still an

543
00:22:14,090 --> 00:22:16,520
active development the API is not

544
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:19,180
perfect but you know it's getting better

545
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:21,470
you know and it serves a single purpose

546
00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:24,170
the purpose that I want so how do we

547
00:22:24,170 --> 00:22:26,600
interface to this it turns out to be not

548
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:29,330
as clean of API as we want it like

549
00:22:29,330 --> 00:22:31,070
ideally I have to write this little

550
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:33,470
helper wrapper function this thing that

551
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:34,850
don't let this frightened new nothing

552
00:22:34,850 --> 00:22:36,500
complicated is happening here it's

553
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:38,390
called a function called gets at lot

554
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:41,240
that long so I'm going to plug in at tle

555
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:44,810
no plug in an optional local time if I

556
00:22:44,810 --> 00:22:46,610
don't pass in a local time it's going to

557
00:22:46,610 --> 00:22:49,430
default and whatever is now and then

558
00:22:49,430 --> 00:22:50,900
it's going to take that local time and

559
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:52,550
this is an important step you have to

560
00:22:52,550 --> 00:22:54,800
convert that to UTC time which is

561
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:58,100
roughly equivalent to gmt time there's

562
00:22:58,100 --> 00:22:59,750
one catch here you have to there's off

563
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:03,560
by one thing in the library so so you

564
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:05,600
have to add one to the JavaScript month

565
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:08,240
the months in JavaScript are zeroth base

566
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,430
so you just add one and everything is

567
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:13,340
happy after that and then there's a lot

568
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:15,170
more to this function actually below but

569
00:23:15,170 --> 00:23:16,700
it's straight up copied from there read

570
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:18,560
me so I didn't really do that much work

571
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:20,600
here I just have to like sanitize it

572
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:22,940
massage the data a little bit all i did

573
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:24,650
is write a nice little wrap around for

574
00:23:24,650 --> 00:23:27,730
it and this is an example of the usage I

575
00:23:27,730 --> 00:23:31,060
plugged in our tle for the sky set one

576
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:33,080
just plugging it right into the function

577
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:35,210
so what that's going to return is an

578
00:23:35,210 --> 00:23:38,060
array of that lung that long of the

579
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:39,620
current position of the satellite

580
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:41,570
because I didn't passing at time I can

581
00:23:41,570 --> 00:23:43,700
optionally pass in whatever time I want

582
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:45,920
so i could say in one hour what's going

583
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,780
to be the lab that long and it will give

584
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:51,140
that and then i'm going to do a simple

585
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:55,550
interval on it nothing too fancy every

586
00:23:55,550 --> 00:23:58,340
two seconds update it and for that

587
00:23:58,340 --> 00:24:00,830
leaflet marker update the latitude

588
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:03,170
longitude and we get something that

589
00:24:03,170 --> 00:24:08,840
looks like i'm having a problem the

590
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:13,700
videos here dan you get something that

591
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:18,170
should be this ah very slight slightly

592
00:24:18,170 --> 00:24:21,200
moving along there and I put a nice

593
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,180
little CSS transition

594
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:25,010
animation on it every two seconds it

595
00:24:25,010 --> 00:24:26,720
gets updated and it kind of jumps a

596
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,970
little so all I did because leaf it

597
00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:30,500
behind the scenes is doing a translate

598
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:33,500
3d I know I can animate that in CSS and

599
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:36,470
I just put a little transition on it a

600
00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:38,960
two second transition so technically the

601
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:41,900
position is a little off but two seconds

602
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:43,280
but it's accurate enough where you get

603
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:45,110
the idea and it looks it moves pretty

604
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:47,660
gracefully across the screen okay that's

605
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:49,100
cool and it's supposed to stop there

606
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:52,220
because it's a video oh now it'd be nice

607
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:54,740
probably to have an orbit line just

608
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:57,560
because that would be nice where where

609
00:24:57,560 --> 00:25:00,530
has the orbit been you know for a period

610
00:25:00,530 --> 00:25:02,000
of time and where is it going to be

611
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,000
that's actually quite useful could be

612
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,160
useful for humanitarian purposes too we

613
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,510
know there's like some event in some

614
00:25:08,510 --> 00:25:10,760
country and we want to see ok we know

615
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:12,650
sky set is an imaging satellite we want

616
00:25:12,650 --> 00:25:14,390
to see when's the next opportunity when

617
00:25:14,390 --> 00:25:16,850
we can actually take an image of that

618
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:18,470
country when's when's the next pass

619
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:20,930
going to be so this turns out to be

620
00:25:20,930 --> 00:25:23,630
quite useful so we can generate what we

621
00:25:23,630 --> 00:25:25,460
call a ground track which is just a

622
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:28,100
basic orbit line nothing too fancy going

623
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:32,060
on here too so don't be afraid the steps

624
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:35,300
are basically how many so we're going to

625
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:36,740
learn a piggyback on the thing that's

626
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:38,090
about the very end of this function

627
00:25:38,090 --> 00:25:40,670
which is a polyline leaflet polyline

628
00:25:40,670 --> 00:25:43,100
accepts an array of latitude longitude

629
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:49,160
and plots them on a polyline and so we

630
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:50,600
have to generate all those latitude

631
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:52,520
longitude and we have to generate them

632
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:54,530
by step intervals so I'm going to say

633
00:25:54,530 --> 00:25:56,240
let's do one minute intervals because

634
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:58,040
that should be pretty enough line

635
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:59,420
especially when we resume doubt it

636
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:01,880
should be pretty smooth and we're going

637
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:03,560
to have a time upset so I'm just going

638
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:06,410
to say give me three hours in the past

639
00:26:06,410 --> 00:26:08,240
and give me three hours in the future

640
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,940
and plot this orbit line for me I'm

641
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:12,500
sticking them into this array that's

642
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:15,710
what that while loop is doing and stick

643
00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:17,450
the polyline on the screen give it a

644
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:20,720
blue color and we get something that's a

645
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:24,890
little ugly so it turns out leaflet has

646
00:26:24,890 --> 00:26:28,190
this problem when the map wraps around

647
00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:30,430
and also when the map goes across the

648
00:26:30,430 --> 00:26:32,900
International Date Line it's a famous

649
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:35,180
source of headaches and all the the

650
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:36,710
computations

651
00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:38,539
that breaks off there just happens to be

652
00:26:38,539 --> 00:26:41,299
the International Date boundary so you

653
00:26:41,299 --> 00:26:42,529
can see the lines at the bottom

654
00:26:42,529 --> 00:26:44,120
obviously aren't correct it's not going

655
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:47,360
to jump across there but with some

656
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,830
further refinements you can get it to a

657
00:26:48,830 --> 00:26:51,169
point where it's a little cleaner than

658
00:26:51,169 --> 00:26:53,630
that there's also some like some

659
00:26:53,630 --> 00:26:55,730
distortion there's some built-in

660
00:26:55,730 --> 00:26:57,529
distortion into these maps actually

661
00:26:57,529 --> 00:26:59,690
because this is a this is a projection

662
00:26:59,690 --> 00:27:02,299
of a 3d space of a sphere so there's

663
00:27:02,299 --> 00:27:04,669
gonna there's actually a huge distortion

664
00:27:04,669 --> 00:27:06,860
at the poles and you can see a little

665
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:08,360
bit of that because our step function

666
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:10,520
isn't precise enough and near the poles

667
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:12,830
you can see actually like the lines

668
00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:15,110
become even more jagged that's actually

669
00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:17,840
an indication of the map distortion and

670
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,399
that sort of leads to what would be the

671
00:27:19,399 --> 00:27:20,960
next steps with what do I do with this

672
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,970
like it actually turns out to be more

673
00:27:22,970 --> 00:27:24,980
useful I don't have time to get into it

674
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:27,080
but you it's actually more intuitive if

675
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:29,299
you go to 3d maps because you can see

676
00:27:29,299 --> 00:27:31,640
the orbits they actually intuitively

677
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:34,010
logically make more sense these orbits

678
00:27:34,010 --> 00:27:35,510
are kind of crazy because there are map

679
00:27:35,510 --> 00:27:38,659
projection doesn't seem right but with

680
00:27:38,659 --> 00:27:40,100
this you have you have a couple tools

681
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:41,600
there's one out there called cesium

682
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:44,390
cesium this is what powers that what I

683
00:27:44,390 --> 00:27:46,850
was talking about before i SAT it kind

684
00:27:46,850 --> 00:27:49,970
of does all the fun work for you so you

685
00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:51,830
don't have to do you can customize it

686
00:27:51,830 --> 00:27:53,720
but you don't have to do terribly a lot

687
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:55,520
of work there's another one that's more

688
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:58,970
customizable with three j/s which is

689
00:27:58,970 --> 00:28:01,909
more of a WebGL type of example and

690
00:28:01,909 --> 00:28:03,590
there's this awesome tutorial that

691
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:06,440
someone other than read it online they

692
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:10,340
start with a sphere and 3gs put a little

693
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:12,470
texture around it put put the map

694
00:28:12,470 --> 00:28:14,779
texture around it stretch it around they

695
00:28:14,779 --> 00:28:16,669
get some clouds as a separate layer that

696
00:28:16,669 --> 00:28:19,370
they can animate separately and the nice

697
00:28:19,370 --> 00:28:20,929
thing about three JSI don't have it here

698
00:28:20,929 --> 00:28:23,270
but you can plug in cad models in here

699
00:28:23,270 --> 00:28:25,730
so i actually found like the cad model

700
00:28:25,730 --> 00:28:27,409
on the share drive somewhere of the

701
00:28:27,409 --> 00:28:29,870
satellite which we've actually like we

702
00:28:29,870 --> 00:28:32,179
we don't have it there anymore and i

703
00:28:32,179 --> 00:28:34,240
can't show it to because of you know

704
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:37,159
restrictions but i was able to plug in

705
00:28:37,159 --> 00:28:39,289
that cad model it was way too big for my

706
00:28:39,289 --> 00:28:40,640
purposes because it had all the little

707
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,890
detailed components about the satellite

708
00:28:42,890 --> 00:28:46,549
inside but that actually worked very

709
00:28:46,549 --> 00:28:47,960
slowly on here and I could see it

710
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:48,960
floating around

711
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,240
up there so that's what you can spring

712
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:52,919
board off of you can do all sorts of

713
00:28:52,919 --> 00:28:54,240
stuff and everyone should be able to go

714
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:57,720
through the examples again I have the

715
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:01,340
link posted there jas kana its bit ly /

716
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:04,260
satellite and that shows all the steps

717
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:06,360
it corresponds to my slides through step

718
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:08,370
1 to the N so everyone should be able to

719
00:29:08,370 --> 00:29:09,960
load that up and be able to tweak it and

720
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:12,600
play around with it yeah ping me on on

721
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,580
Twitter if you have any questions or any

722
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:15,960
questions about what I've been working

723
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:19,799
on happy to to answer so yeah that's

724
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:21,450
about it thank you for thank you for
