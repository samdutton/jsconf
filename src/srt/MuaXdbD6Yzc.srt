10
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:32,079
I'm very excited to be here two parts of

11
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:34,239
my talk rely on real-time communication

12
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:36,520
between my phone my laptop and your

13
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:40,690
laptops and the Wi-Fi seems to be

14
00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:42,969
operating by courier pigeon here so

15
00:00:42,969 --> 00:00:45,940
perhaps if you could turn off the Wi-Fi

16
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:48,040
on your laptops just for the duration of

17
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:49,660
this talk look at this room for the

18
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:55,720
phones to actually work and it's just

19
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:59,070
stopped working okay all right so I work

20
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:02,829
for intercom in Dublin Ireland we also

21
00:01:02,829 --> 00:01:06,009
have offices in San Francisco and London

22
00:01:06,009 --> 00:01:08,619
you might recognize us from our

23
00:01:08,619 --> 00:01:10,180
messenger which is in the bottom

24
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:12,729
right-hand corner of a lots of great web

25
00:01:12,729 --> 00:01:14,770
businesses it's a react app to pay two

26
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:17,590
and a half years old we also have quite

27
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:20,620
a large amber app which is the app that

28
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:22,270
our customers use day in day out and

29
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:24,640
it's four and a half years old unlike

30
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,799
most amber apps that follow the six week

31
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:29,950
upgrade release cycle it's never been

32
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:32,650
healthier in terms of codebase

33
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:34,750
having had quite a few chats with some

34
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:37,180
of you in the last couple of days I know

35
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:39,090
a lot of you work for great companies

36
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:41,500
I'm proud to say the intercom is also a

37
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:44,320
great company we've a strong ambition to

38
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,180
become one of the great technology

39
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:48,460
companies unlike all great companies we

40
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:50,470
like to share our ideas these are some

41
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:53,310
books that we publish as an example

42
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:56,140
sharing stories helps us attract amazing

43
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:58,900
people to intercom everyone who joins

44
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:01,689
our under into under anniversary their

45
00:02:01,689 --> 00:02:03,490
entry to get an inter comic which kind

46
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:06,340
of celebrates some of the impact and fun

47
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:09,429
that they've had over a year these are

48
00:02:09,429 --> 00:02:12,150
my four inter comics they're all amber

49
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:15,909
themed the reason I'm telling you this

50
00:02:15,909 --> 00:02:17,319
in a little more detail than I normally

51
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:20,800
would is to give you some background for

52
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,739
this conference talk each year we hold a

53
00:02:23,739 --> 00:02:24,819
series of

54
00:02:24,819 --> 00:02:28,120
dr. focus events across the world where

55
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,530
we share our approach to building

56
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:32,079
products that hopefully people love this

57
00:02:32,079 --> 00:02:35,680
picture is from San Francisco and this

58
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,590
is London and Dublin and in November

59
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:41,049
last year again in Dublin in famous

60
00:02:41,049 --> 00:02:43,450
vicar street we had a first set of

61
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:46,480
technical talks about our approach to

62
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:50,109
building and iterating products in

63
00:02:50,109 --> 00:02:53,200
income this was a really amazing night

64
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,370
it was more like a Radiohead concert

65
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:57,849
than a typical tech event I'm forward I

66
00:02:57,849 --> 00:02:59,409
wanted to come up with something a

67
00:02:59,409 --> 00:03:02,250
little different and hopefully fun I

68
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:05,109
think it's amazing that we get to live

69
00:03:05,109 --> 00:03:06,669
in a time where it's possible to build

70
00:03:06,669 --> 00:03:08,949
an impactful career where the work

71
00:03:08,949 --> 00:03:10,719
rarely feels like work and I just want

72
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:13,739
to have a little fun with my talk so

73
00:03:13,739 --> 00:03:17,230
this was the first slide of my talk

74
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:18,639
gonna be good intro to the rest of this

75
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:21,340
talk my slides are an Amber app running

76
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:24,010
on my laptop I'm also running the same

77
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:26,169
app on my phone which allows me to

78
00:03:26,169 --> 00:03:30,370
control the presentation I'll soon ask

79
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:32,439
you to open the same web app on your

80
00:03:32,439 --> 00:03:34,689
phones too so you can interact with the

81
00:03:34,689 --> 00:03:44,169
presentation so when I trigger drum

82
00:03:44,169 --> 00:03:47,290
sound on my phone will send real-time

83
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:49,479
messages to all connected phones and

84
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:51,009
these messages are being relayed through

85
00:03:51,009 --> 00:03:54,639
a simple socket I own node server which

86
00:03:54,639 --> 00:03:57,189
is running in Amazon's California data

87
00:03:57,189 --> 00:04:01,720
center so the initial part of my talk

88
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:04,000
that I gave in Dublin went pretty well

89
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:12,519
this was a high point then a few seconds

90
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:30,939
later it actually no longer works

91
00:04:30,949 --> 00:04:35,069
so the server crashed I'd no way to get

92
00:04:35,069 --> 00:04:37,319
the presentation running again so I

93
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:38,729
couldn't complete the second part of my

94
00:04:38,729 --> 00:04:40,740
12th Jan not a huge deal one of the

95
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:43,680
themes of that night was risk-taking

96
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,069
this was a little bit of a risk

97
00:04:46,069 --> 00:04:48,900
after go home I realized my mistake I

98
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:50,699
was missing a guard there was a race

99
00:04:50,699 --> 00:04:52,889
condition and an exception brought down

100
00:04:52,889 --> 00:04:54,810
the server at the time I hadn't done

101
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:56,879
much node I've done a little more now

102
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:58,919
hopefully that is a lesson learned

103
00:04:58,919 --> 00:05:03,599
we'll see so I got to give my talk a

104
00:05:03,599 --> 00:05:05,069
second time earlier in the year and

105
00:05:05,069 --> 00:05:07,590
eMERCOM from Portland happily all the

106
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:10,199
major parts of the talk worked through a

107
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:34,979
few little issues luckily they were

108
00:05:34,979 --> 00:05:38,520
mostly minor UI issues and the broadly

109
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:41,580
worked as I'd hoped as luck would have

110
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:43,500
it the third instrument the orange one

111
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:44,099
at the bottom

112
00:05:44,099 --> 00:05:45,779
I was actually controlled by someone in

113
00:05:45,779 --> 00:05:48,599
Zimbabwe there was a live stream and

114
00:05:48,599 --> 00:05:51,449
Lennox happened to be you know picked

115
00:05:51,449 --> 00:05:54,469
randomly which is pretty special

116
00:05:54,469 --> 00:05:57,750
so before we try to here I want to talk

117
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:59,580
a little bit about the software that

118
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:01,909
allows these presentations to be created

119
00:06:01,909 --> 00:06:05,069
since amber calm I've begun extracting

120
00:06:05,069 --> 00:06:08,849
the guts there of that talk into an

121
00:06:08,849 --> 00:06:11,939
Amber add-on called Amber present and it

122
00:06:11,939 --> 00:06:13,860
allows anyone to create rich interactive

123
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:16,199
real-time presentations with Amber

124
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:19,259
components so amber knew to create an

125
00:06:19,259 --> 00:06:22,159
ember app and reinstall amber present

126
00:06:22,159 --> 00:06:25,319
allows it to become a slideshow an Amber

127
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:28,589
generate slide will generate at the root

128
00:06:28,589 --> 00:06:32,520
and the components so presentation

129
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,979
slides are defined much like amber

130
00:06:34,979 --> 00:06:37,370
routes just with slide instead of Rouge

131
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:42,480
and slide contents are defined in

132
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:45,640
so with a little content in style here's

133
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:53,620
those exact slides and as presentations

134
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:56,070
can be interactive they can also can

135
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:59,050
define multiple roles so in this case

136
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:01,060
there is a presenter role in a screen

137
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:04,030
role and running locally this is what

138
00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:13,420
that looks like and here's what this

139
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:14,800
talked and giving right now looks like

140
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,740
when running locally so at the top is

141
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:20,800
the screen on the very left is my phone

142
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,830
and then for phones in the audience as

143
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:25,270
you can see it's it's real-time it's

144
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:27,640
very easy to create like real-time polls

145
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:31,480
and things of that there's other useful

146
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,790
components so components for doing code

147
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:36,700
with highlighting and video components

148
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:40,030
and as real-time controls for playback

149
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:43,270
or setting sections and I can yeah by

150
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:45,820
pressing button change the video not

151
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:47,470
particularly useful you can do things

152
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:48,940
like change your background color in

153
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:50,770
real time as well I'm just clicking a

154
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:55,080
button there and represent comes with

155
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:59,950
tailwind CS CSS so it's very easy to

156
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:02,590
spin up and style slides and this should

157
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:04,510
help adding themes which I hope to do

158
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:11,980
soon slides scale keepo 69 ratio and

159
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:14,320
it's also because it's real-time I can

160
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:23,890
do like a real-time pointer this is an

161
00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:25,090
animated slide that I created for

162
00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:26,620
another talk that I gave two years ago

163
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:30,400
an animated guide to ember and the thing

164
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,110
I'm most excited about and I only

165
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:33,849
recently realized that whatever present

166
00:08:33,849 --> 00:08:37,590
is the possibility of publishing

167
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:39,880
presentations as NPM packages and

168
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,710
allowing others to import them into

169
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:44,800
their own presentations and reusing them

170
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,560
so I've created a lot of animations like

171
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:50,130
this that have only been seen once and

172
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:52,020
hopefully it can be useful to other

173
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:54,900
people when going to like local meetups

174
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:57,990
or conferences or whatever if you saw

175
00:08:57,990 --> 00:09:00,600
Chad's talk on compilers this morning

176
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:03,210
and performance this is a visualization

177
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:05,520
I made of a earlier version of the

178
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:09,150
glimmer VM and I'm kind of showing it

179
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:10,320
now because I wanted to be seen in a

180
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,850
second time because it took me like two

181
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:15,480
weeks to make it's a little out of date

182
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:18,300
now but it's showing the inner workings

183
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:21,180
of the glimmer VM as if initially

184
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:25,830
rendered as a page so I'm hoping to redo

185
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:28,020
these animations to bring them up to the

186
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:29,430
latest glimmer version so that other

187
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:30,960
people can use them

188
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:33,810
here's another example this is Alex Alex

189
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:36,090
Marcin ear giving a great talk on his

190
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:38,790
ember concurrency add-on and his

191
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:40,710
presentation was a custom-built Hammer

192
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:45,600
app to demonstrate his this was a real

193
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,640
inspiration to me at the time I wanted

194
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,260
to be able to put amber into my

195
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:52,560
presentations like his so with his

196
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,810
permission yesterday i extracted some of

197
00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:58,440
his components from his talk into and

198
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:03,120
amber presented on so here are those

199
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,620
slides here so you can just amber

200
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:08,340
install that add-on and you you get

201
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:11,160
slides like this so briefly amber

202
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:15,390
concurrency is a add-on for an API

203
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:17,810
declarative API for constraining

204
00:10:17,810 --> 00:10:20,760
concurrent tasks and the core primitive

205
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:24,270
is tasks which accept generator

206
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:25,950
functions so in this case it's just a

207
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:28,290
simple function that waits for two

208
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:32,220
seconds and I can click perform here and

209
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:33,870
actually you can see a visualization of

210
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:37,430
this running so by default they all run

211
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:39,900
concurrently amber concurrency isn't

212
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:42,600
doing anything but we get these task

213
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,760
modifiers so here is the drop modifier

214
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:48,450
and you can see if I run this it well if

215
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:49,740
there's already an instance of a task

216
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:52,140
running it will drop you tasks until

217
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:55,460
it's it's clear

218
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:58,470
here's another modifier and cue and you

219
00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:02,420
can guess what that does accuse them up

220
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:06,720
and probably the most reason we are most

221
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,690
commonly used one is restartable it

222
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:13,710
could be used for like depends search

223
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:17,430
and things that as a final example in

224
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:18,750
amber camp this year

225
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:21,529
Edward Falconer introduced his new

226
00:11:21,529 --> 00:11:42,240
add-on amber animation so like where

227
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,149
amber concurrency I created a few slides

228
00:11:45,149 --> 00:11:46,950
to demonstrate this as well so I the

229
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:48,360
left and right button here and if I

230
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:50,459
click left you'll see one of the logos

231
00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:52,860
randomly will move from less than the

232
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:54,930
right to the left if I hit it a few

233
00:11:54,930 --> 00:11:56,370
times left and right they kind of do a

234
00:11:56,370 --> 00:11:59,250
dance which is cool the amazing thing

235
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:01,200
about amber animated is that all I'm

236
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,910
doing here is defining where the list

237
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:05,070
should be rendered and then removing an

238
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:08,430
item and inserting it into your array in

239
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:10,470
a random location and the natural

240
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:14,220
movement emerges from the sprites which

241
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:17,010
are coordinating behind the scenes and

242
00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:19,620
this animation these animations can also

243
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:21,390
happen across routes here as we saw

244
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:24,750
there so amber and I made it as a core

245
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:29,310
primitive within amber present so soon

246
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:33,690
it will be easy to have nice animations

247
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:35,570
between slides

248
00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:40,980
alright so live demo time it's 2018 it's

249
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:43,650
like this will maybe work I don't know

250
00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:45,959
if you'd like to participate please take

251
00:12:45,959 --> 00:12:48,779
out your phone and load this web address

252
00:12:48,779 --> 00:12:55,829
bitly slash JSC 1:8 when it loads you

253
00:12:55,829 --> 00:12:57,870
can enter your name just click Next if

254
00:12:57,870 --> 00:12:59,610
your name is taken just put in a random

255
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:05,610
name will be triggering sounds in your

256
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:08,880
phone so please turn up the volume and

257
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:11,579
you can press the buttons to test the

258
00:13:11,579 --> 00:13:16,380
sound locally if you get an iPhone you

259
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:18,360
mean it may need to flip the lid the

260
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:28,829
mute switch you can see in the top right

261
00:13:28,829 --> 00:13:30,390
there's a count of the number of people

262
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:33,180
connected I know there's maybe 200

263
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:48,420
people in the rim so this demo will work

264
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:49,890
best if your phone doesn't go to sleep

265
00:13:49,890 --> 00:13:51,060
so every now and again you'll get a

266
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:52,890
little reminder just to touch the screen

267
00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:56,760
to keep it awake if it's not working VA

268
00:13:56,760 --> 00:14:00,270
for some reason perhaps you could record

269
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:02,160
some minutes for Twitter presuming it

270
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:05,550
works alright so this is a simple

271
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:07,800
example of triggering real-time drums on

272
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,959
your phones every time I press a button

273
00:14:09,959 --> 00:14:12,209
they'll send real-time messages to your

274
00:14:12,209 --> 00:14:19,170
phone to play a particular sound alright

275
00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:20,820
notice that the drum sounds are all

276
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:23,670
playing at the same time we're all

277
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:25,260
connected where we're connected to

278
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:26,760
arrange different networks or mobile

279
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,620
networks and even if we're on the same

280
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:30,270
network there's a range of different

281
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:32,640
Layton sees even on a single phone from

282
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:35,160
one request to the next and this will be

283
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:38,730
even clearer if I trigger drumbeat to

284
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:40,470
play and this will probably sound pretty

285
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:48,020
bad

286
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:53,200
yeah you can visualize the different

287
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,780
latencies on your phones by running some

288
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:57,040
tests so if you can click the test

289
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,670
latency button on your phone and it'll

290
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:03,010
do a series of request responses with

291
00:15:03,010 --> 00:15:07,300
the real-time server and you'll likely

292
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:10,830
see some variance in your own device

293
00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:16,960
hey the graph is sorted all right so

294
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,730
what's this saying

295
00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:20,830
most people are under 100 milliseconds

296
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:24,010
which bodes pretty well I think for the

297
00:15:24,010 --> 00:15:27,280
rest of the talk so one approach to

298
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:29,590
dealing with latency is to get a shared

299
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:31,270
understanding of what time it is on all

300
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:33,430
the phones if we can do that we can

301
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:35,350
schedule stands to play at a particular

302
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:39,430
time so phones generally keep the same

303
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:40,810
time but there's still enough of a

304
00:15:40,810 --> 00:15:43,630
difference across phones that it would

305
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:45,580
wouldn't work for a drum machine and

306
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:47,560
what we can't do though is ping the

307
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:49,300
server and measure how long it takes so

308
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:52,870
let's assume 20 milliseconds in toll and

309
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:54,670
we can assume that a request hop takes

310
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:57,300
about half the times 10 milliseconds and

311
00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:00,160
if the server includes its time in the

312
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,500
response and we add the 10 milliseconds

313
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:05,890
to that and the phone has a pretty good

314
00:16:05,890 --> 00:16:06,970
understanding of what time it is

315
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:08,920
compared to the server so this is the

316
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:11,470
strategy we took when we run those

317
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:15,460
latency tests in your phone this graph

318
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:17,620
is showing the difference in time across

319
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:20,530
phones so phones on the Left are behind

320
00:16:20,530 --> 00:16:22,710
the server time phones on the right are

321
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:25,360
ahead of it pretty amazing that

322
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:29,020
everyone's almost on the same time so

323
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:30,370
let's see if it works let's see if it's

324
00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:33,330
any better so I'll trigger trigger some

325
00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:39,860
sounds to play but in 1 seconds time

326
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:42,130
that seems better let's try the drum

327
00:16:42,130 --> 00:16:51,150
machine

328
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:57,740
all right thanks so actually when I've

329
00:16:57,740 --> 00:16:59,270
done that before this has more like

330
00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:03,050
that's not meant to work as well well

331
00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:11,959
let me try just the iPhones alright

332
00:17:11,959 --> 00:17:15,309
that's pretty good and the androids oh

333
00:17:15,309 --> 00:17:27,079
right and the androids well that's the

334
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:29,600
best Android is everyone I mean I I love

335
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:38,090
Android but their latency see I don't

336
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:40,070
think it's a real word but if it was I

337
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:42,290
think there's a it this is kind of a

338
00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:43,850
audio lies ation of Android

339
00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:46,670
fragmentation just like an iOS the

340
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:49,910
operating system receives our JavaScript

341
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:52,460
function to execute the send is received

342
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:54,380
and queued up at the right time it's

343
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:56,360
just that there's a range of different

344
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:58,220
onboard Layton sees when it comes to

345
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:02,120
stand on androids one of the reasons why

346
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:05,330
different lag times are so noticeable is

347
00:18:05,330 --> 00:18:07,640
that drum sounds have got a really sharp

348
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:09,860
attack time meaning all that sound kind

349
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:12,679
of happens at once if we take a sound

350
00:18:12,679 --> 00:18:16,100
that's got a more gradual attack like

351
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:19,130
orchestral sounds and it allows us some

352
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:21,410
leeway with the latency so I've put

353
00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:23,120
together twelve different orchestral

354
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,940
sounds from a section of Beethoven's

355
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:27,380
fifth symphony which I'll randomly

356
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:33,650
assign to different devices now alright

357
00:18:33,650 --> 00:19:16,650
so this is about 40 seconds here we go

358
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:18,560
it worked

359
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:25,230
[Music]

360
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:27,980
all right now we have the phone synced

361
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:30,980
up let's bring in the house speakers so

362
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:32,540
if you could choose which section of the

363
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:35,080
room you're in so left middle or right

364
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:40,010
if you'd like to participate so I'm

365
00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:43,130
going to randomly assign some MIDI

366
00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:44,990
devices which are running on my machine

367
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:46,910
so this is a piece of software called

368
00:19:46,910 --> 00:19:49,610
Ableton Live which is a digital audio

369
00:19:49,610 --> 00:19:51,410
workstation which is predominantly used

370
00:19:51,410 --> 00:19:54,530
for generating and performing electronic

371
00:19:54,530 --> 00:19:57,170
music and I've created a short track for

372
00:19:57,170 --> 00:19:59,420
this talk and others using for

373
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:02,270
synthesizers which you can see here if I

374
00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:23,049
just play

375
00:20:23,059 --> 00:20:29,940
okay okay odyo is working okay so the

376
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:32,790
black area on the right is also running

377
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:35,100
the same ember up just in a different

378
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:38,820
role and I'm also running a local node

379
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:42,179
server which is subscribed to real-time

380
00:20:42,179 --> 00:20:45,630
events and it translates these events

381
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:47,750
into MIDI signals which are sent to

382
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:52,110
Ableton Live so I've arranged it so for

383
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:53,760
people and the audience can control

384
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:57,120
different parts that he synthesizes so

385
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,210

386
00:20:59,210 --> 00:21:10,020
