00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,680

my name is jason chen and I'm from San

2
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,420
Francisco California in the United

3
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:17,050
States and I most

4
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:19,150
for developer I don't actually work out

5
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:22,150
any company right now I i started my own

6
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:24,640
company two and a half years ago sold

7
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,649
that or three and a half years ago so

8
00:00:26,649 --> 00:00:30,939
bad and then worked at worked at the

9
00:00:30,939 --> 00:00:32,769
acquiring company for two years which

10
00:00:32,769 --> 00:00:35,680
was salesforce.com and after leaving

11
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,019
that I just went to work on open-source

12
00:00:38,019 --> 00:00:40,269
full-time the company that i started i

13
00:00:40,269 --> 00:00:43,720
was i was the founder and i was a

14
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:46,899
software engineer so I took a lot of the

15
00:00:46,899 --> 00:00:49,989
product along with my co-founder and the

16
00:00:49,989 --> 00:00:51,670
company basically it was a collaborative

17
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:54,430
text editor of a code editor and so

18
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:56,620
people used it to do remote interviews

19
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:59,170
or any sort of code collaboration

20
00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:02,980
remotely and at some point we wanted to

21
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:05,649
transition that that into rich text

22
00:01:05,649 --> 00:01:08,860
which is what got me started what got me

23
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:11,200
started going with quill GS which is the

24
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,050
thing that I was talking about today

25
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:16,060
yeah it started it started at the

26
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:18,390
company that I started which ciebie on

27
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:21,700
and we continue to work on it because he

28
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:24,280
all source wanted to build that into

29
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:27,369
their product and so we continue to work

30
00:01:27,369 --> 00:01:29,110
on it at Salesforce although not as much

31
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:32,440
and then after i left i continue to work

32
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:35,500
on quill and so when we still sail

33
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:38,080
source open source it under bsd so it's

34
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,550
very permissive license and they're

35
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:42,160
they're very supportive even when we

36
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:44,800
were there of a bus working on it and so

37
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,509
but i decided i kind of wanted to do

38
00:01:46,509 --> 00:01:48,879
that more and things ended with the

39
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:50,379
project that we were working on at co

40
00:01:50,379 --> 00:01:52,929
source as well yeah so yeah so

41
00:01:52,929 --> 00:01:56,739
javascript is the editor that i'm

42
00:01:56,739 --> 00:01:58,660
working on quill j/s is completely and

43
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:01,450
in JavaScript or I guess technically

44
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:03,190
it's in CoffeeScript and it compiles to

45
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:04,530
JavaScript Oh

46
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:08,160
or of it on kind of other parts of it

47
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,470
are in JavaScript but yeah it's

48
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:13,250
completely front only JavaScript library

49
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:15,540
well so our company was sold to

50
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:16,980
Salesforce so it's not really mine

51
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:18,870
anymore and I don't have much control

52
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:22,950
over it um I'm not sure what their plans

53
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:25,920
are for it I've kind of not been a part

54
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,709
of that for a while so I guess I don't

55
00:02:28,709 --> 00:02:31,920
know okay yeah I'd like to start another

56
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,200
company i think currently i love working

57
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,270
on open source I've met amazing people

58
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:39,720
on it while working on it and I think

59
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,670
it's it's definitely something that I

60
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:44,040
wanted to I did I wanted to do and

61
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,690
didn't have much time to do before with

62
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:49,739
what kind of a for-profit profession and

63
00:02:49,739 --> 00:02:52,950
so I'm enjoying that now I do think that

64
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:55,410
a goal of any good open source project

65
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:57,959
is where for one it should have goals

66
00:02:57,959 --> 00:03:01,170
and once those goals are met it's not

67
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:02,910
like a product that you keep adding on

68
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:05,069
to it has a kind of a defined purpose

69
00:03:05,069 --> 00:03:06,989
and at some point it'll meet up that

70
00:03:06,989 --> 00:03:10,590
purpose and all you really need to do

71
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:14,329
after that is kind of make it faster or

72
00:03:14,329 --> 00:03:18,269
make it smaller or just the fixed bug so

73
00:03:18,269 --> 00:03:21,750
I'm not sure I see a lot to do in close

74
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:24,739
future before it gets to that point but

75
00:03:24,739 --> 00:03:27,320
eventually it'll get to that point and

76
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:29,070
eventually I'd like to start another

77
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:32,310
company um yeah so this first time I

78
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:35,640
I've been in Argentina in Buenos Aires

79
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:38,790
my second time in Latin America on so I

80
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:40,920
don't know that much about it I do know

81
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:41,490
you got

82
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:44,400
have really good food I like I'm almost

83
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,560
a carnivore and that I eat a lot of meat

84
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,560
and I don't like vegetables so I was one

85
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:53,010
of those kids I had one of the best

86
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:56,220
meals in my life yesterday last for

87
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:59,010
dinner we're just ate like four five

88
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:02,820
hours the red meat was non-stop and wine

89
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:05,610
and that was that was amazing so I would

90
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:08,040
love to see Argentina and Buenos Aires

91
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:11,850
continue that I think JavaScript I i

92
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:15,630
I've actually been I've been surprised

93
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:17,340
by what I've been able to learn at this

94
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:21,120
conference like you know I guess I like

95
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,600
as someone that is speaking here I guess

96
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,490
I kind of feel like on average two

97
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:27,870
speakers know a little more than the

98
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:30,060
attendees but even I was learning a lot

99
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:32,940
and I think it's very JavaScript

100
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:37,850
basically I mean it's kind of it has an

101
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:42,390
unavoidably important future because I

102
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:45,240
mean it's what everyone it's the one

103
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,770
language that you can use on the front

104
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:51,120
end so I be very I was very excited

105
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:55,320
about kind of the things in es6 that was

106
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:58,140
being talked about and I think that

107
00:04:58,140 --> 00:04:59,790
actually raised a lot of questions were

108
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:01,950
a lot of stuff like coffee script that I

109
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:07,560
was using another typescript etc there's

110
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,330
more questions about those types of

111
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:10,740
things but I think JavaScript

112
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:13,970
undoubtedly has a very important part in

113
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:15,270
what
