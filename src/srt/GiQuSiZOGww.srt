00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:12,680

hello Budapest and good afternoon

2
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:13,580
everybody

3
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:17,990
I'm sure you all had a good lunch I hope

4
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:20,210
you all don't sleep after the end of 30

5
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:22,580
minutes so I'll try my best to keep

6
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:26,329
y'all awake alright let's get started

7
00:00:26,329 --> 00:00:32,029
so yes technology has already become

8
00:00:32,029 --> 00:00:34,610
more productive and more natural more

9
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:37,130
intuitive the interfaces are more

10
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:40,670
intuitive more natural now having

11
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:42,800
interfaces this way makes the user

12
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,199
understand the product better or like

13
00:00:45,199 --> 00:00:48,980
come closer with it so here I am Prince

14
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:52,309
iam working for a solando in Berlin and

15
00:00:52,309 --> 00:00:55,280
to talk about natural user interfaces

16
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:02,499
using javascript so we typed we clicked

17
00:01:02,499 --> 00:01:07,540
touched next what next next could be

18
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:12,050
alright I will go to the next slide with

19
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:15,410
a demo and the demo is highly dependent

20
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:35,640
on light so I really hope it works

21
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:39,580
okay so two slides again so we typed

22
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:47,860
clicked touched next what yeah so this

23
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:49,960
is what I am going to talk to y'all

24
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:53,620
about natural user interfaces using

25
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:54,610
javascript

26
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:56,530
this demo will you go over your so let

27
00:01:56,530 --> 00:01:59,020
me just close it but yes it did its

28
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:03,240
purpose and yes so it could be gestures

29
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:07,150
right it could be a speech it could be

30
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:09,670
anything natural user interfaces could

31
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:13,390
include touch we typed we clicked touch

32
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:15,970
was more intuitive than click because it

33
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:18,090
was more direct next I would say

34
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:25,030
gestures or speech yes evolution of user

35
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:28,690
interfaces so somewhere this was coined

36
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:31,350
somewhere back in the 90s

37
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:35,050
wherein it started with CLI command line

38
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:37,420
interface wherein user had to understand

39
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:40,390
of an artificial medium that is the

40
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:42,820
keyboard to input something and to

41
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:44,070
interact with the interface

42
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:47,800
next came GUI graphical user interface

43
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,450
with the advent of the mouse

44
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:53,560
users could interact more closely better

45
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:56,260
than the keyboard with the interface and

46
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:59,230
understand the interface more better and

47
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:03,010
now we have this NUI with the advent of

48
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:05,620
a are we are perceptual computing we

49
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:07,989
hear that everywhere if we just do a

50
00:03:07,989 --> 00:03:09,850
search on the internet what is the state

51
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:11,830
of art what we are AR or perceptual

52
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:14,410
computing there are there is lot

53
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:18,459
happening out there and anyway has more

54
00:03:18,459 --> 00:03:21,850
space and it is more direct it is more

55
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:29,170
intuitive yes natural user interfaces to

56
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:30,850
coin it it is a system for

57
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:34,660
human-computer interaction wherein users

58
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:37,420
interact more intuitively more directly

59
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:41,769
perform more closer tasks these

60
00:03:41,769 --> 00:03:44,530
interfaces are yes are more natural and

61
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:47,750
more intuitive

62
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:51,930
yes a quick study about natural user

63
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:54,989
interfaces revealed this sub info graph

64
00:03:54,989 --> 00:03:58,950
this was taken from the internet a big

65
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:01,920
it was done and then yeah the results of

66
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,500
a link of a pretty cool because the work

67
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,709
areas where it's targeting that is

68
00:04:06,709 --> 00:04:08,909
entertainment education social

69
00:04:08,909 --> 00:04:10,319
connections health care environment

70
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:12,269
natural user interfaces has its impact

71
00:04:12,269 --> 00:04:18,329
everywhere so here I am to talk about

72
00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:22,019
anyway plus jeaious and I would coin at

73
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:23,930
us in you ijs

74
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:27,120
JavaScript has its broad appeal and it's

75
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,610
because of this broader appeal a lot of

76
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:33,330
people like to try it and we admit it or

77
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:36,479
not it is JavaScript which dominates the

78
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:40,470
web today and yes here is what we are to

79
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:43,770
celebrate javascript and may javascript

80
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:47,280
be with all of us so let's talk about nu

81
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:54,930
IJ s yes this is my the interesting

82
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:57,300
slide I like to talk about motivation

83
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:59,580
whenever I like to do something or I

84
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:01,169
have to do something or I have to

85
00:05:01,169 --> 00:05:04,620
motivate somebody yes so how did this

86
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:07,919
whole idea start any yjs how did it how

87
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:11,630
all of this started so it started with

88
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:14,370
me building trying to build a simulator

89
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:18,000
for motion control devices or in other

90
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,849
words 3d cameras I have a Whitney or

91
00:05:20,849 --> 00:05:23,490
leap motion today I will talk about more

92
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:28,020
about it later but yes so the any yjs

93
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:29,760
started when I was trying to build a

94
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:33,300
simulator for 3d cameras or motion

95
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:37,020
control sensors and yes there is another

96
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:40,410
motivation behind as to how I started to

97
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:41,639
come up with this idea of trying to

98
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:44,460
build a simulator so of what what so

99
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:45,030
happens

100
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:48,510
oh say oh you are a go yeah Oh your ago

101
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:51,449
I was trying to trying a talk about

102
00:05:51,449 --> 00:05:54,479
perceptual computing and then I was

103
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,960
trying this intel's realsense sdk and

104
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,820
two days prior to the talk and stole the

105
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:00,500
story

106
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:01,940
so please bear with me if you are

107
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:04,490
listening again two days prior to the

108
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:05,090
talk

109
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:07,490
windows and my system crashed and then I

110
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:10,610
didn't have a backup what to do and I

111
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:13,880
didn't have backup of my cord and this

112
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:16,790
SDK which I was trying to walk on solely

113
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:19,940
relied on Windows and then that's how I

114
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:23,000
started to think about how about trying

115
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,200
to build some simulator

116
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:27,620
where then maybe it is a platform

117
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:29,630
independent or and whether you don't

118
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:32,930
have to or it is not dependent on any

119
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:36,500
platform or you don't have to use any

120
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:39,560
device right so that's how this idea of

121
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:44,810
simulator originated and then yes the

122
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:47,900
simulator was there the next was what do

123
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:50,690
I do with the simulator so next was try

124
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:53,470
to build some apps for the simulator and

125
00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:56,780
down down those lights I'll be talking

126
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:59,480
about two apps that is one is the

127
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:02,150
slideshow which I just showed you all

128
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:04,400
about using gestures I controlled my

129
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,760
slide it's kind of bad it's like not

130
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:10,669
very neat it's highly dependent on light

131
00:07:10,669 --> 00:07:12,610
and after to control the frame rates

132
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:16,070
things like that but yes it's serving

133
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:19,520
its purpose and the other app I want to

134
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:22,580
talk about is draw how about imagine

135
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:26,270
this you grabbing a device and you open

136
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:28,880
an app do some doodles in the air and

137
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,310
watch your art appear on the screen yes

138
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:34,760
so I have I have come up with this app

139
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:36,979
called draw and the other one is slight

140
00:07:36,979 --> 00:07:40,550
so yes that's about like how it all got

141
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:45,620
started how any ideas started yes before

142
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:49,580
getting started I had to like try and

143
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:52,190
understand as to what is this all the

144
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:54,200
hype about right of method reality

145
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,630
virtual reality perceptual computing

146
00:07:56,630 --> 00:07:58,100
there are so many devices out in the

147
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:00,800
market augmented reality as the word

148
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,340
augmented says the reality or it is real

149
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:06,800
the environment is real but there now it

150
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,500
is augmented augmented as an added so

151
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,360
I'm standing here maybe I want to show

152
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,090
some background like Taj Mahal in India

153
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:16,669
or something else arise on a desert so

154
00:08:16,669 --> 00:08:18,710
I'm mending the reality and that is what

155
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:21,169
augmented reality is about that's why

156
00:08:21,169 --> 00:08:22,570
where we see augmented reality

157
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:25,820
applications in real estate things like

158
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:27,410
that right you're augmenting the reality

159
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:30,440
next it's about virtual reality what is

160
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:32,630
this virtual reality about virtual

161
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:35,599
reality the reality doesn't exist at all

162
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:37,610
you are like trying to create a virtual

163
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:39,409
environment you are simulating you are

164
00:08:39,409 --> 00:08:41,029
trying to build an environment which

165
00:08:41,029 --> 00:08:43,130
doesn't exist at all so it could be

166
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:46,820
assimilated environment then yes we have

167
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:49,100
this perceptual computing bringing

168
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:51,770
human-like senses to devices yes there

169
00:08:51,770 --> 00:08:53,510
are like so many devices out there with

170
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:55,279
support augmented reality virtual

171
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:57,279
reality perceptual computing

172
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:59,870
applications and perceptual computing is

173
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:02,630
making the device understand behave more

174
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:05,320
like human understand gestures wise

175
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,400
giving more of like human-like

176
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,350
capabilities into the device and that is

177
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:11,630
perceptual computing perceptual being

178
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:15,130
able to perceive being able to see oh

179
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:18,380
yes so I already said there are a lot of

180
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:24,290
devices out in the market and so yes

181
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:25,370
what next

182
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:27,230
there is this motivation somebody

183
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:29,770
standing here somebody got started and

184
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:32,959
out of nowhere somebody like got into

185
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:34,520
this new world there are like so many

186
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:36,620
devices out in the market people are

187
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:38,839
already talking about us there is so

188
00:09:38,839 --> 00:09:41,029
much hype about this everybody wants

189
00:09:41,029 --> 00:09:43,760
this baby to fly so there is perceptual

190
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,070
computing and the virtual reality

191
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:48,260
augmented reality devices everybody

192
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:51,200
there's so much hype so what next what

193
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,050
next next would be like how do I get

194
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:56,990
started right so I will tell you about

195
00:09:56,990 --> 00:10:03,500
how I got started and yes how I'll show

196
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,029
you the simulator and I'll show you the

197
00:10:05,029 --> 00:10:06,800
apps and maybe if you are interested

198
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:10,640
catch me after the talk yes

199
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:13,040
so as this great man says any

200
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,930
sufficiently advanced technology is

201
00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:18,589
indistinguishable from magic before we

202
00:10:18,589 --> 00:10:21,560
get into some technical aspects related

203
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:25,490
to this natural user interfaces I would

204
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:27,649
like to make a statement here you

205
00:10:27,649 --> 00:10:29,839
after my attempt to build a universal

206
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:31,970
simulator for all the devices out there

207
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:34,040
with this one-woman army standing here I

208
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:36,170
finally gave up and thought of you know

209
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:38,170
focusing on something one and trying to

210
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:40,790
really get it right and then maybe like

211
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:43,009
you know use the same old thing and Here

212
00:10:43,009 --> 00:10:45,050
I am I have chosen this leap motion

213
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:45,829
controller

214
00:10:45,829 --> 00:10:49,009
yes we are all here at a GS conf

215
00:10:49,009 --> 00:10:51,199
I'm not here to advertise about any

216
00:10:51,199 --> 00:10:53,689
device but please excuse me if I am

217
00:10:53,689 --> 00:10:55,519
talking about leap motion I don't want

218
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:57,740
to talk about it in particular but it's

219
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,949
a humble effort by a JavaScript

220
00:10:59,949 --> 00:11:02,329
enthusiast to try out something there

221
00:11:02,329 --> 00:11:04,490
and to share it with the community so if

222
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:07,040
at all I have chosen leap motion it is

223
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,749
just a random choice and yes I just got

224
00:11:08,749 --> 00:11:11,480
lucky I was gifted with this leap motion

225
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:13,519
and that was the first obvious choice to

226
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:16,790
try other sleep motion and try to build

227
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:19,220
a simulator for leap motion now when I'm

228
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:22,699
talking about simulator the simulator is

229
00:11:22,699 --> 00:11:25,759
nothing but so any of these devices they

230
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:27,860
will come with your SDK even this leap

231
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:30,829
motion comes with the SDK and my

232
00:11:30,829 --> 00:11:32,600
simulator what it does is you can try

233
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,550
out the SDK without actually using this

234
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:36,889
hardware so you have this service

235
00:11:36,889 --> 00:11:38,959
running or software running and then you

236
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:41,149
can get the whole SDK running without

237
00:11:41,149 --> 00:11:43,160
actually using the sleep motion and you

238
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,980
can see how to get started and who would

239
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:48,050
get benefit out of this say you're

240
00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:50,389
trying to create a workshop or next

241
00:11:50,389 --> 00:11:52,339
tutorial for a larger audience and then

242
00:11:52,339 --> 00:11:54,170
people don't have the actual hardware or

243
00:11:54,170 --> 00:11:56,600
are really interested to try something

244
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,459
and want to get their hands dirty first

245
00:11:58,459 --> 00:12:00,559
before like buying out something then

246
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:03,459
yes this is the solution

247
00:12:03,459 --> 00:12:06,949
alright so irrespective of if it's a

248
00:12:06,949 --> 00:12:08,839
leap motion or anything we need to

249
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:10,339
understand as to how the whole

250
00:12:10,339 --> 00:12:12,620
architecture works so there are all

251
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:15,290
these devices which we connect with to a

252
00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:18,589
computer using this USB cable and what

253
00:12:18,589 --> 00:12:21,139
happens is this USB controller reads the

254
00:12:21,139 --> 00:12:23,899
sensor data and these are devices it

255
00:12:23,899 --> 00:12:25,309
depends on the device depends on the

256
00:12:25,309 --> 00:12:26,899
manufacturer depends on the company or

257
00:12:26,899 --> 00:12:29,029
manufacturing of the device as to how

258
00:12:29,029 --> 00:12:33,879
they want to yeah its left at them yes

259
00:12:33,879 --> 00:12:37,129
there would be like few 2d or 3d cameras

260
00:12:37,129 --> 00:12:39,259
there would be infrared sensors to sense

261
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:41,520
your to recognize what's happening

262
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,529
and so this USB controller reads the

263
00:12:43,529 --> 00:12:45,959
sensor data the next what happens this

264
00:12:45,959 --> 00:12:49,620
data is stored in local memory next data

265
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:53,270
is then streamed by our USB to the SDK

266
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:56,310
it is the streaming thing which is of

267
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:58,380
prime importance and we need to

268
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:00,420
understand what happens when we actually

269
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:07,290
do the streaming so to understand more

270
00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:15,130
about how the sleep ocean would work

271
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:18,390
yeah so what happens here is we have

272
00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:20,550
this USB controller and then there is

273
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:22,110
sleep service running in there

274
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:25,589
now once the USB controller reads the

275
00:13:25,589 --> 00:13:27,300
sensor data stores it in local memory

276
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:29,279
and then again streams it back to the

277
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:31,950
usb so what happens is once the image

278
00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:35,100
data is streamed to your computer then

279
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:37,860
the whole of this mat world comes into

280
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:39,660
picture the bunch of these algorithms

281
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:43,649
which come into play which may be like

282
00:13:43,649 --> 00:13:46,980
eliminate noise and just give the region

283
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:48,959
of interest to you so there is this lot

284
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:51,690
of processing happening behind and then

285
00:13:51,690 --> 00:13:56,310
again it's device dependent as to how

286
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:57,990
they want to process and how they were

287
00:13:57,990 --> 00:14:00,480
in what format they want to or give the

288
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,329
data to the SDK so in this case what

289
00:14:03,329 --> 00:14:05,130
happens is there's a sleep service and

290
00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:07,579
the other good thing is all of these

291
00:14:07,579 --> 00:14:10,589
devices they are connected to the USB

292
00:14:10,589 --> 00:14:14,370
port and the way they stream data after

293
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:16,380
reading the sensor data storing local

294
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:18,120
memory are the way they stream it is

295
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:21,180
happening through a protocol slide up so

296
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:23,399
if it's a network or native than it is

297
00:14:23,399 --> 00:14:26,310
TCP protocol and then if it is web-based

298
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:28,649
it is WebSockets and I'm here to talk

299
00:14:28,649 --> 00:14:30,930
about a web-based solution so it's all

300
00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:34,649
about WebSockets all of these SDKs they

301
00:14:34,649 --> 00:14:37,620
create a WebSocket server and then they

302
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:38,940
do the streaming back to the application

303
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:41,250
and that is how the application is able

304
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:45,779
to get back the data in this case leap

305
00:14:45,779 --> 00:14:47,339
service would have its WebSocket server

306
00:14:47,339 --> 00:14:52,279
running in 6 4 3 7 port number 6 437 so

307
00:14:52,279 --> 00:14:54,990
next I'll show you

308
00:14:54,990 --> 00:14:58,290
some code and I have like uploaded it

309
00:14:58,290 --> 00:15:01,529
here I'll be sharing the slides and yes

310
00:15:01,529 --> 00:15:03,120
there were like few references which

311
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,670
have used there were this good open

312
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:08,190
source libraries out there webcam Swiper

313
00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:18,170
and GS object detector

314
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:21,240
so the first thing what I'm here to show

315
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:24,690
y'all about is the app called draw right

316
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:27,120
so I have this app called draw which

317
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,960
works the same code works with leap

318
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:33,360
motion and works without leap motion and

319
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,790
this draw what it does is right now I've

320
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:37,680
just enabled it for like one finger I

321
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,810
just move one finger and then I'm able

322
00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:41,760
to like you know track my finger

323
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:43,530
movements and draw something on the

324
00:15:43,530 --> 00:15:46,890
screen so this is what the app does and

325
00:15:46,890 --> 00:15:49,320
it's able to run with the device or

326
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:52,680
without the device now a little more

327
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:56,580
about the simulator all these devices

328
00:15:56,580 --> 00:16:00,600
they use this web sock they use this

329
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,490
WebSocket server for the streaming

330
00:16:02,490 --> 00:16:06,600
process and what I do is I create the

331
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,850
simulate the idea of the simulator is to

332
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:12,840
create a no J's WebSocket server and

333
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:15,000
this WebSocket server can run on any

334
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,250
port and all you have to do is you have

335
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:19,890
to configure your SDK to talk to your

336
00:16:19,890 --> 00:16:22,290
WebSocket server instead of the SDK

337
00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:25,740
server which works which works if a

338
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:27,600
device is connected so if your device is

339
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,640
not connected we run the web server

340
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:32,400
server and then we send in the or data

341
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:40,110
so let's see how this draw works so

342
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:43,470
first I will of shot show or draw with a

343
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:46,050
leap motion controller so now I'm

344
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:48,600
connecting the sleep motion I have this

345
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:53,730
connected and I have my WebSocket server

346
00:16:53,730 --> 00:17:00,660
running on port number 3000 and sorry so

347
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:03,270
now I'm using the leap motion so I don't

348
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:10,200
want my WebSocket server so this part by

349
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:12,180
default it talks to the leap motions

350
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:14,130
WebSocket server which is running on 6 4

351
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:23,040
3 7 and let's do this so ok I'm not sure

352
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:34,560
about the light

353
00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:36,820
yeah the demos okay now everything is

354
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:48,080
good maybe because of the light

355
00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:55,630
yeah okay so it's moving

356
00:17:55,640 --> 00:18:07,430
okay please move sorry

357
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:11,070
was that for me okay can someone turn

358
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:12,570
the lights up on the stage please

359
00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:18,460
I thought somebody's angry I'm sorry

360
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:29,230
okay let me just stand here and

361
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:37,400
okay

362
00:18:37,410 --> 00:18:43,410
oh no no it has to walk let's make it

363
00:18:43,410 --> 00:18:52,330
walk please bear with me

364
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:54,710
I think this is so unavoidable right no

365
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:59,360
matter how short that your demo is when

366
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:04,970
you are presenting it has to break this

367
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:13,670
is just not moving okay let me just try

368
00:19:13,670 --> 00:19:19,640
the leap motion yeah okay so uh fine the

369
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:21,590
motion is not working so I'll just try

370
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:23,450
my simulator and let's see if that is

371
00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:30,380
working to make my simulator run all I

372
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:33,050
have to do is I'll be telling look into

373
00:19:33,050 --> 00:19:35,780
the port 3000 I can obviously make my

374
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:38,120
WebSockets overrun at 6 4 3 7 where in

375
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:40,430
the leap motions default WebSocket

376
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:43,820
server is running at but yes I prefer

377
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:49,730
3000 here so I save it and I have this

378
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:54,650
my WebSocket running yes ok so now this

379
00:19:54,650 --> 00:19:57,470
application what I've done is it's

380
00:19:57,470 --> 00:19:59,630
basically WebSocket right so it is a

381
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:02,060
client-server model so this screen what

382
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:04,490
you see is a client and then there is

383
00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:06,890
the server which has to send signals to

384
00:20:06,890 --> 00:20:08,660
the WebSocket and then the WebSocket

385
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:10,160
will send back the signals to all the

386
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:12,320
connected clients so the architecture

387
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:34,970
looks like my two browsers

388
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:42,210
so long so and then it is so draw yeah

389
00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:50,580
okay

390
00:20:50,590 --> 00:21:03,740
okay this is not running either so the

391
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:06,320
idea was right now what I'm doing is

392
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:09,410
it's the same code but then I'll unplug

393
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:16,050
the sleep motion it's the same code I

394
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:18,290
just want to see the output

395
00:21:18,290 --> 00:21:29,210
but so the idea was I am passing the

396
00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:32,660
coordinates so I know what sort of data

397
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:37,160
format the leap motion expects I have my

398
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:39,800
server running so I'm you know moving

399
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:42,440
the mouse coordinates I'm moving the

400
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:44,060
mouse coordinates and then it's sending

401
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:46,820
the data to the WebSocket server and

402
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:48,770
then the WebSocket server sends back the

403
00:21:48,770 --> 00:21:51,560
data to the leaped line so in this case

404
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,840
this is my application what you see or

405
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:57,140
hear where when you see the blue dot is

406
00:21:57,140 --> 00:21:59,210
supposed to be the client and then this

407
00:21:59,210 --> 00:22:01,180
mouse part oh yeah

408
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:04,160
all right so right now it's the same

409
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:07,370
leap motion code I'm not using gestures

410
00:22:07,370 --> 00:22:08,990
so I'll come to the gestures part later

411
00:22:08,990 --> 00:22:12,920
I'm just a user using my mouse touchpad

412
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:15,260
and then I'm able to do this doodles on

413
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:17,450
the screen it's not a good noodle but

414
00:22:17,450 --> 00:22:19,160
yes the idea is they're being able to

415
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:22,400
draw something so I have my this server

416
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,950
sitting here which is taking coordinates

417
00:22:24,950 --> 00:22:28,670
taking the positions it would be the

418
00:22:28,670 --> 00:22:30,290
same way as though like you have your

419
00:22:30,290 --> 00:22:33,260
gestures and then the gestures are being

420
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:34,970
recognized by the leap motion and then

421
00:22:34,970 --> 00:22:38,300
it's sure you know it's taken by the

422
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:41,690
application yes

423
00:22:41,690 --> 00:22:46,460
so let's look into the code what happens

424
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:49,520
here this is my WebSocket server few

425
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:52,610
lines of code and this is all you need

426
00:22:52,610 --> 00:22:55,880
to create a WebSocket server and my

427
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:58,220
application the server part which acted

428
00:22:58,220 --> 00:23:01,010
like a server which had to give data to

429
00:23:01,010 --> 00:23:03,800
the WebSocket server and then this web

430
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:06,290
sockets over the one running at 3,000

431
00:23:06,290 --> 00:23:08,900
would give back to the application the

432
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:14,480
draw application so in this case yeah

433
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:17,390
all I'm doing is I'm just up getting my

434
00:23:17,390 --> 00:23:19,700
mouse coordinates and then I'm creating

435
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:22,130
this you know I'm sending through

436
00:23:22,130 --> 00:23:25,490
WebSocket server and I'm sending the

437
00:23:25,490 --> 00:23:27,530
hands and the point Able's so leap

438
00:23:27,530 --> 00:23:31,510
motion has this data or JSON format and

439
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:34,910
this is the kind of API which the leap

440
00:23:34,910 --> 00:23:37,460
motion expects so it will look for like

441
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:39,860
other any gestures are there hands hands

442
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:43,280
yes leap motion is able to okay it's too

443
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:47,300
much like leap motion is able to

444
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:49,370
identify which hand it is if it is right

445
00:23:49,370 --> 00:23:51,440
hand or if it is left hand and the point

446
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,990
tables refer to the fingers so I am

447
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:57,110
referring to the index finger and this

448
00:23:57,110 --> 00:24:01,340
is how I'm walking the data so I tell

449
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:03,500
you know the point Able's and I'm

450
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:06,770
passing up the index finger right so it

451
00:24:06,770 --> 00:24:10,490
will be like an array of 5 or 0 1 2 3

452
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:13,190
and forth so I'm passing up the data for

453
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:15,290
the first finger index finger and then

454
00:24:15,290 --> 00:24:17,090
I'm calling the tip position where it is

455
00:24:17,090 --> 00:24:19,160
the X and the y coordinates so the tip

456
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:21,380
position is actually a vector in 3d

457
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:23,810
space XYZ but then I'm capturing or 3

458
00:24:23,810 --> 00:24:25,520
coordinates and then I'm giving to a

459
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:27,500
WebSocket server and then this WebSocket

460
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:30,050
server gives to the leap so in the sleep

461
00:24:30,050 --> 00:24:31,820
what it happened was it's the same code

462
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:33,710
which you have to run if a device is

463
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:38,570
connected or no and yes so if you're

464
00:24:38,570 --> 00:24:40,430
connecting the device just uncommon the

465
00:24:40,430 --> 00:24:42,650
second line it will refer to the default

466
00:24:42,650 --> 00:24:44,330
port which is running on 6 4 3 7

467
00:24:44,330 --> 00:24:47,170
otherwise it will love there are four on

468
00:24:47,170 --> 00:24:51,170
three thousand so let the lights meet

469
00:24:51,170 --> 00:24:54,020
there I'll just try with leap motion

470
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:57,830
again so I am NOT referring to my local

471
00:24:57,830 --> 00:24:59,390
server but then I am referring to my

472
00:24:59,390 --> 00:25:07,740
leap motion now

473
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:10,750
in this case I would only need one

474
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:23,440
because okay yeah so okay

475
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:32,289
finally yeah so I think I don't know if

476
00:25:32,289 --> 00:25:34,990
I have time but yes the demo of just

477
00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:38,700
broke a bit and I got little nervous and

478
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:42,070
but yes it did its job so this is the

479
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:44,890
whole idea and you already saw how I

480
00:25:44,890 --> 00:25:47,350
control the slideshow with gestures so

481
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:48,940
then what's happening is in the first

482
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:50,830
draw app what I'm doing is I'm passing

483
00:25:50,830 --> 00:25:52,929
the coordinates okay excuse me from

484
00:25:52,929 --> 00:25:54,669
talking superfast now I'm excited

485
00:25:54,669 --> 00:25:57,850
because my demo work and enough running

486
00:25:57,850 --> 00:26:00,669
out of time but sure can I get five more

487
00:26:00,669 --> 00:26:05,860
minutes please okay okay fine so the

488
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:08,440
idea is the way the slides are connected

489
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:10,330
right so when I had to connect the

490
00:26:10,330 --> 00:26:12,309
slides it was gestures and not any mouse

491
00:26:12,309 --> 00:26:14,830
coordinates so here what happens is I

492
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:17,650
had to learn a few things about computer

493
00:26:17,650 --> 00:26:22,210
vision and the library saw which I've

494
00:26:22,210 --> 00:26:24,460
mentioned are already out there there is

495
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:26,970
also this ah good thing load OpenCV and

496
00:26:26,970 --> 00:26:29,679
two good libraries that is jeaious

497
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:35,270
object detect which were like very good

498
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:39,490
yeah so uh this is a very good object

499
00:26:39,490 --> 00:26:41,559
detection algorithm used in computer

500
00:26:41,559 --> 00:26:43,600
vision I'm not any open Seanie expert

501
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,520
but then yes when I was doing this up I

502
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:48,580
had to learn a little bit about this so

503
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:50,549
up in the gestures in the slideshow

504
00:26:50,549 --> 00:26:52,929
there were like two things so I had this

505
00:26:52,929 --> 00:26:56,260
my app running on a browser window and

506
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:59,350
then it obviously was talking to the

507
00:26:59,350 --> 00:27:03,580
leap motion or SDK but I didn't use the

508
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:06,429
leap motion device I had to uh I gave

509
00:27:06,429 --> 00:27:08,500
the signals through my hand now this

510
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:10,630
hand this hand signals obviously came

511
00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:12,940
from the load socket web server now how

512
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:14,770
this hand was detected was using this

513
00:27:14,770 --> 00:27:17,289
wire Jones algorithm and first it was

514
00:27:17,289 --> 00:27:19,390
feature selection I have to understand

515
00:27:19,390 --> 00:27:20,440
what my hand

516
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:22,810
and then creating uh you know we do the

517
00:27:22,810 --> 00:27:25,810
grayscale so that noise is eliminated

518
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:28,420
then do some math on it get an integral

519
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:30,580
image and do some other boosts training

520
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:32,080
like you know train it and get some

521
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:35,050
classifiers and make this up you know

522
00:27:35,050 --> 00:27:37,000
are features of the hand map to the

523
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,890
classifier which is already trained and

524
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:41,410
then yes you know it is a hand and then

525
00:27:41,410 --> 00:27:43,960
this hand coordinates of the hand I know

526
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:45,910
I can locate the coordinates of the hand

527
00:27:45,910 --> 00:27:48,100
it was this coordinate of the hand which

528
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:49,960
were sent to the WebSocket server and

529
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:53,440
the WebSocket server a knew which

530
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,630
position it was there was some logic

531
00:27:55,630 --> 00:27:57,340
written if it is this side then it is

532
00:27:57,340 --> 00:27:59,260
left or if it is this side it is right

533
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:01,840
and then now give back to my slide

534
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:05,200
application so this is all how it was

535
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:09,390
about so yes this was a humble effort

536
00:28:09,390 --> 00:28:11,530
and then there were few other things

537
00:28:11,530 --> 00:28:14,560
about web sockets and getusermedia to

538
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:16,480
know more about this I am doing this

539
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,700
session at the Mozilla hacker launch

540
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:20,470
tomorrow at 3:15

541
00:28:20,470 --> 00:28:23,500
if y'all are interested so come and

542
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:28,330
learn to learn to create a selfie or

543
00:28:28,330 --> 00:28:30,460
sharing session using WebSockets and get

544
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:33,010
user media so you will understand more

545
00:28:33,010 --> 00:28:34,210
about this client-server architecture

546
00:28:34,210 --> 00:28:37,020
water which is used in the simulator and

547
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:39,940
yes so this was a humble effort by a

548
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:42,090
JavaScript enthusiast to do something

549
00:28:42,090 --> 00:28:45,190
