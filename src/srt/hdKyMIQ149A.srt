1
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:22,120

I'm to be a Schneider from unique Toby

2
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:25,630
Taylor and Twitter I haven't repaired a

3
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:27,580
lot of slides so actually that's my only

4
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:31,300
slide for today so I have to watch it

5
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:41,110
for the next 20 minutes no okay yeah I

6
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:43,120
haven't repaired a lot of sliders said

7
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,370
am I just want to demo you a project

8
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:47,640
I've been working on for a while

9
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:50,310
actually I'm working on it seems about

10
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:58,329
four or five years so and it all started

11
00:00:58,329 --> 00:01:01,480
with the idea to create and VNC viewer

12
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:05,199
in JavaScript all of you guys know what

13
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:11,259
VNC is probably okay so it started the

14
00:01:11,259 --> 00:01:13,030
first version of that means if you in

15
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:19,780
JavaScript five years ago and bought and

16
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:23,440
it worked well but it wasn't really sexy

17
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:28,240
enough to release it so I was waiting

18
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:34,030
for some sugar to push it out and that

19
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:42,310
chica came in form of noches so if you

20
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:45,459
have expected to see a remote desktop

21
00:01:45,459 --> 00:01:47,259
solution which our script that's not

22
00:01:47,259 --> 00:01:48,580
what I'm showing you what I'm showing

23
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:51,220
you a tool that lets you create your own

24
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:54,160
services based on wii and see with no

25
00:01:54,160 --> 00:02:03,920
chairs so

26
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:07,470
so I think the most of you has used VNC

27
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:09,950
in the past as a remote desktop solution

28
00:02:09,950 --> 00:02:13,860
but under the roof what it basically

29
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:17,880
does means he it's just a frame buffer

30
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:20,880
that is shared with the clients that are

31
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:30,410
connected to it so it's switch to the

32
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:36,239
text mode and reduce chosen some demo so

33
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:41,310
what I first created is a implementation

34
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:43,200
of the remote frame buffer protocol

35
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,500
which is the protocol that is used by

36
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:51,330
VNC to stream all the changes on a on a

37
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:54,620
screen or on a buffer to all its clients

38
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:59,690
so I can show you a little demo of that

39
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:07,060
so just start a little vincy server

40
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:21,600
adventure and first using a native in

41
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:24,570
decline to connect it just to see how it

42
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:28,350
looks like with a regular VNC client so

43
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:36,890
let's connect to local host okay nice

44
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:40,950
that is just a little trying demo now

45
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:42,870
you connect to the ravine see climbing

46
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:48,230
can draw on a screen and you can also

47
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:54,900
connect to it let the Chavez with a

48
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:57,090
shell script view well let's see if it

49
00:03:57,090 --> 00:04:05,670
works yet so

50
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,189
so what you see here at the left is Oh

51
00:04:09,189 --> 00:04:16,070
where's my mouse pointer here this is

52
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:19,130
the browser is the VNC implementation in

53
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:20,690
JavaScript which using web socket to

54
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:24,590
connect to the VNC server for the

55
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:27,229
project I'm using a modified version of

56
00:04:27,229 --> 00:04:29,539
a modified version of living seas

57
00:04:29,539 --> 00:04:33,350
library that is a native c library which

58
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:41,180
is used by by ro rhe in CT server and as

59
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:50,870
you can see and I let's reconnect so you

60
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:53,180
can see you can draw on the right that's

61
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:54,680
the native in C server and that's the

62
00:04:54,680 --> 00:05:00,320
choice between c0m0 all the changes are

63
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:08,120
in retail but that's not all so as I

64
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:11,810
said before you can with my to you can

65
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:15,320
create your own services with note based

66
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,330
on the VNC or the remote frame buffer

67
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:22,130
protocol so and I give you a little demo

68
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:31,400
how easy it is so after you checked out

69
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:34,849
the project and get up you can start a

70
00:05:34,849 --> 00:05:40,220
new project and first you have to

71
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:45,740
require the note screen module so let's

72
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:49,480
do this

73
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:51,830
hmm

74
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:58,700
okay and then you can create a VNC

75
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:06,800
server a frame buffer just by let's save

76
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:19,320
it in a real so screen that crude server

77
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:23,080
I'm passing an object and an option and

78
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:27,620
keyboard object as the first parameter

79
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:30,230
and let's set the dimensions of the

80
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:36,490
frame buffer so with 800 and height of

81
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:41,960
600 and the second argument is a

82
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:44,780
callback which gets fired every time a

83
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:46,640
new client is connecting to the VNC

84
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:50,960
server and that callback is taking a

85
00:06:50,960 --> 00:07:02,580
client object as its argument so this so

86
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:07,040
so let's print out a little console

87
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:09,320
message every time a new client is

88
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:17,090
connecting to sue sue and then you can

89
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:23,680
start a server on localhost

90
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:35,660
on port so let's start this over ouch

91
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:47,189
Charles what is narrow

92
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:50,930
mm-hmm let's just let's have a look in

93
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:56,650
here

94
00:07:56,660 --> 00:08:04,600
what happens okay yeah I did port first

95
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:11,960
hostname a second so okay so now our VNC

96
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:16,610
server is running and we can't connect

97
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:21,370
to it first with the native VNC client

98
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:27,110
today so it's an empty screams let's

99
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:31,850
just just a black screen having the

100
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:34,849
dimensions we pass to the create several

101
00:08:34,849 --> 00:08:39,410
method we can also connect to it with

102
00:08:39,410 --> 00:08:53,960
the new JavaScript viewer so rip so once

103
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:56,630
a new client is connected and it fires

104
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:59,960
the the callback you pass to the create

105
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:03,220
server function as the second argument

106
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:06,050
you can listen on that client object you

107
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:07,700
can add event listener and callbacks and

108
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:09,530
can listen to all Mouse events and

109
00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:12,830
pointer events so for example you can

110
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:29,430
say client on pointer move

111
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:36,740
yep three star server

112
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:42,820
reconnecting should I should use this

113
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:49,510
like I know what okay let's connect into

114
00:09:49,510 --> 00:10:00,889
it move it a little bit with a mouse

115
00:10:00,899 --> 00:10:13,060
oh yeah let's go damn it sorry yeah

116
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:17,630
so we connect and you can see all the

117
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:21,770
pounder events or fired we can also lock

118
00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:27,230
the current mouse position by this minor

119
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:41,920
works

120
00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:44,570
term

121
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:54,590
hip

122
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:57,630
so now we've graded our first green sea

123
00:10:57,630 --> 00:11:02,279
server and what a note screen provides

124
00:11:02,279 --> 00:11:07,050
you is access to a frame buffer in form

125
00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:11,029
of a node buffer which is just a

126
00:11:11,029 --> 00:11:13,709
allocated bunch of memory which presents

127
00:11:13,709 --> 00:11:16,500
a frame of it just presents a pixel

128
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:19,829
array when you have worked with a canvas

129
00:11:19,829 --> 00:11:21,540
on client site or canvas in the browser

130
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:23,310
you know the pixel array when you have a

131
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:26,370
2d context and you're calling the metal

132
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:29,610
get image data and accessing the data

133
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:34,050
property so then you get back kind of

134
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:35,910
array which represents the pixels in the

135
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:45,779
canvas so and that's what you get in not

136
00:11:45,779 --> 00:11:50,990
screen and once you've created a server

137
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:58,500
you can listen to refresh event and that

138
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:04,319
event is fired 25 times per second you

139
00:12:04,319 --> 00:12:06,630
can define that frame rate by passing it

140
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:10,939
here in that option object you can see

141
00:12:10,939 --> 00:12:16,470
refresh rate 10 so that's that means

142
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:17,939
daddy with the Refresh you when it gets

143
00:12:17,939 --> 00:12:25,079
fired 10 times per second and the frame

144
00:12:25,079 --> 00:12:30,089
buffer the pixel array is passed to that

145
00:12:30,089 --> 00:12:32,639
call back as the first argument so

146
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:40,730
that's the frame buffer

147
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:43,500
so now at that point you can put any

148
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,910
pixel the sources you want into that

149
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:48,160
frame buffer and it gets synced with all

150
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,350
the clients that are connected to the

151
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:56,200
server so I mean let's make a little

152
00:12:56,200 --> 00:13:01,089
little game which just puts a white

153
00:13:01,089 --> 00:13:03,010
rectangle on the screen for each client

154
00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:04,750
that is connected to the VNC server and

155
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:07,540
all the connected clients can just move

156
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:15,829
their own rectangle over the screen so

157
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:18,730
so frame buffer is just a regular bother

158
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:20,910
you can put in there whatever you want

159
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:30,310
that's so we can't use for example note

160
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:34,720
canvas to draw into the buffer so let's

161
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:42,730
require no cameras of course you have to

162
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:46,900
install it first wire NPM I did that

163
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:54,940
before so let's have an array of players

164
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:58,060
that are connected to the game just an

165
00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:01,000
arrow so when every time a new client is

166
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
gay connects to the server we create a

167
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:11,740
new player object I'm storing the

168
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:19,600
current position started 0-0 adding at

169
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:29,589
it to the list of players so and let us

170
00:14:29,589 --> 00:14:32,170
control our rectangle with the arrow

171
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:41,830
keys so that's at some look un's on it

172
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:49,230
on key down

173
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:56,930
so we check in a switch block which key

174
00:14:56,930 --> 00:15:04,790
we have breast this q sim case screen

175
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:13,310
key no chain also provides some key

176
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:15,170
constants because we don't have to know

177
00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:18,470
which key fires which kick-out so you

178
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:22,940
can just use the key object which is

179
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:24,470
exported by not scream by the note

180
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:29,490
scream module so you can say I'm down

181
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:40,660
just increase the stakes by 50 pixels so

182
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:53,050
let's copy that okay on up that's

183
00:15:53,050 --> 00:16:01,310
decrease it okay and we add on for damn

184
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:09,500
it I hate text made for right okay put

185
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:22,259
you increase why not x plus

186
00:16:22,269 --> 00:16:30,759
when you put a left is it okay okay and

187
00:16:30,759 --> 00:16:34,069
he in the Refresh loop we draw all the

188
00:16:34,069 --> 00:16:39,500
players on the canvas so first we have

189
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:46,190
to get T now that's wrong here canis so

190
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:54,800
we can create a canvas 800 600 and we

191
00:16:54,800 --> 00:17:12,020
need a context 2d ok let's clear the

192
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:15,799
screen first maybe that's not the most

193
00:17:15,799 --> 00:17:20,140
efficient code but it's okay for demo I

194
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:38,380
sorry clear right 600

195
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:40,570
nope

196
00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:45,490
okay so let's iterate through the

197
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:48,039
players array and throw by electric

198
00:17:48,039 --> 00:17:51,909
rectangle for each player let's do a

199
00:17:51,909 --> 00:17:59,940
fill style let's make them all white CDX

200
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:10,659
correct we're position let's make 100

201
00:18:10,659 --> 00:18:19,389
and 100 white height said okay okay and

202
00:18:19,389 --> 00:18:21,700
then we have to copy the pixel data out

203
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:24,000
of the canvas in India or frame buffer

204
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,559
so let's do that by creating a new

205
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:33,090
buffer out of the pixel data image data

206
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:39,720
position know so just wonder you have to

207
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:45,549
Jehol cameras and copy it into the frame

208
00:18:45,549 --> 00:18:48,980
buffer

209
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:55,289
looks good let's give it a try okay

210
00:18:55,289 --> 00:19:06,900
let's connect with the native plant okay

211
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:12,940
there's our white rectangle it's not

212
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:20,559
working why is it not working okay it's

213
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:33,080
not this it's player of course

214
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:44,620
so let's see if it works now yeah you

215
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:51,429
can control it so let's connect with the

216
00:19:51,429 --> 00:20:00,460
web client let's damn it over there

217
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:22,600
it is Oh mr. school yeah here you can

218
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,580
grade your own games you can grade your

219
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:27,669
own remote desktop solution base w just

220
00:20:27,669 --> 00:20:29,620
have to write some simple note bindings

221
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:32,919
that perhaps your your mac screen or

222
00:20:32,919 --> 00:20:37,360
your x11 screen and and cup just copy

223
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:40,450
that into the frame buffer and it synced

224
00:20:40,450 --> 00:20:42,190
to all the clients using the VNC

225
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:50,190
protocol and or creating a super fancy

226
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:55,980
canvas super mario game or whatever and

227
00:20:55,980 --> 00:21:01,480
let it run on the outside or on browsers

228
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:03,100
that support canvas you can run it and

229
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:05,289
client site in the web browser and for

230
00:21:05,289 --> 00:21:06,549
clients that doesn't support canvas you

231
00:21:06,549 --> 00:21:09,700
can run it on outside and connecting

232
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:12,159
with even with all the devices like a

233
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:15,549
Nokia Symbian s60 device they all have

234
00:21:15,549 --> 00:21:19,600
been seat lines in Java and you can play

235
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,309
together with other with iphone users

236
00:21:21,309 --> 00:21:25,120
with chrome or WebKit users or Firefox

237
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:30,070
