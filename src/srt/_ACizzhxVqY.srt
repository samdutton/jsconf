1
00:00:08,309 --> 00:00:11,670

all right I can actually the the Iraq

2
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:13,410
this is the first time in about thirty

3
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:16,260
years that Kilauea has stopped erupting

4
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:21,900
so alright so my talk is about offline

5
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:24,180
peer-to-peer mapping and some work that

6
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:26,970
I've been doing for I don't know four

7
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:27,899
years now

8
00:00:27,899 --> 00:00:31,439
geez it's been a long time so my slides

9
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:33,600
are online if you want to check them out

10
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,520
later I've got a lot of links at the end

11
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,899
so this is me I'm a member of bits co-op

12
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:43,530
we do consulting work as a worker owned

13
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:45,390
cooperative and I've been working with

14
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:47,909
this nonprofit NGO Digital democracy

15
00:00:47,909 --> 00:00:51,480
since 2015 or so building these

16
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,460
peer-to-peer mapping tools used by

17
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:57,329
indigenous communities so the groups

18
00:00:57,329 --> 00:00:59,699
that I'm going to be focusing on are

19
00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:02,819
based out of Guyana and Ecuador with

20
00:01:02,819 --> 00:01:06,930
Alianza Sabo in the Ecuador region of

21
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:08,880
the Amazon and also into Peru a little

22
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,090
bit here's a map of that just to give

23
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:15,509
you some idea so I also got the

24
00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:18,270
opportunity to travel to Guyana to meet

25
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:20,540
some of the environmental monitoring

26
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:27,869
team there and the mapping team so I'm

27
00:01:27,869 --> 00:01:29,549
gonna start with some of the issues

28
00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:34,159
facing the the wattage on communities

29
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:37,920
nations in Guyana in the South Rupununi

30
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,130
it's near Brazil so there's a huge

31
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:44,130
problem right there right now with gold

32
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:47,009
mining both illegal and also through

33
00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:50,520
mining concessions so the environmental

34
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,530
monitoring team that we've been working

35
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:56,850
with has reported over 250 observations

36
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:59,159
of illegal activity or harmful activity

37
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:03,020
the mercury gets into the water supplies

38
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:06,890
damage to cultural sites sacred sites

39
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:09,720
deforestation there's a lot of problems

40
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,340
with this kind of extractive industry

41
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:15,780
and at here at the end over 50 percent

42
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:17,340
of those have been caused by this mining

43
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:19,890
activity in the wattage on right now are

44
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:20,980
working

45
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:22,810
they're in talks with the government of

46
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:26,560
Guyana to push back against this

47
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,720
Canadian gold mining company that wants

48
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,490
to come in and mine

49
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:33,510
Rudy Mountain which is a site of

50
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:37,930
considerable cultural significance so

51
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:41,340
here's here's a quote from Ron James the

52
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:44,470
the sort of person who does a lot of

53
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:47,110
mapping work with ArcGIS and like lugs a

54
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:50,110
bunch of maps when he goes when he takes

55
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:52,209
the plane ride from Georgetown to let

56
00:02:52,209 --> 00:02:56,320
them and you know also is doing a lot of

57
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,060
good work with plotters and that's

58
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:02,050
difficult on generator power and I'm

59
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:03,280
just gonna read this quote really fast

60
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,560
because I think it's important to quote

61
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:08,110
directly from our partners that we work

62
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:10,209
with so by mapping the mining pollution

63
00:03:10,209 --> 00:03:11,769
sources we now understand how it affects

64
00:03:11,769 --> 00:03:13,780
wider river systems and water supplies

65
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:15,519
that are essential to our villages for

66
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:20,260
fishing bathing and drinking we're

67
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:22,420
bringing this monitoring information to

68
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:23,950
the attention of the environmental and

69
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:25,209
mining authorities yet the problem

70
00:03:25,209 --> 00:03:27,400
continues unabated and to give you some

71
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,500
more idea of what we're talking about

72
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:33,790
here so this is a map of the whole map

73
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:36,360
pretty much is the traditional

74
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:39,730
territorial extent of the Whopper Chang

75
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:43,390
and the blue areas are formal titles

76
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:44,709
that have been granted by the government

77
00:03:44,709 --> 00:03:48,549
and down there in pink are the mining

78
00:03:48,549 --> 00:03:50,320
the existing mining concessions that

79
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,900
they've had to deal with and Maruti

80
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:55,030
mountain where this new bout of gold

81
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:56,890
mining that they're organizing to resist

82
00:03:56,890 --> 00:04:00,220
is in an area that the one of the

83
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:03,269
communities in the middle I Shelton is

84
00:04:03,269 --> 00:04:05,709
requested a territorial extension for it

85
00:04:05,709 --> 00:04:06,940
and it's you know it's it's a

86
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:11,730
complicated difficult political problem

87
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:14,440
but importantly this work has been going

88
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:17,200
on for a while since 2000 this

89
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,989
particular mapping effort so it's not I

90
00:04:19,989 --> 00:04:23,919
think it's important for technologists

91
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:25,510
like me who want to work on these

92
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:28,050
projects that you're coming when

93
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:30,760
presence is requested for technical

94
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:33,370
assistance and kind of just listening

95
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:34,490
and understand

96
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:39,080
and working with existing political

97
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:45,580
projects so the other another group that

98
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:47,750
digital democracy has been partnered

99
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:49,970
with is Alianza Sabo this is a group

100
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:55,639
that operates out of Ecuador and the

101
00:04:55,639 --> 00:04:58,400
main problem for the Huaorani and also

102
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,710
the kafan and other groups in the area

103
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:04,930
is oil Maya is oil drilling and so

104
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:07,370
there's been drilling since about the

105
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:09,590
60s and it causes all kinds of problems

106
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:12,229
as you can imagine like damage to

107
00:05:12,229 --> 00:05:15,949
ecosystems deforestation and the new

108
00:05:15,949 --> 00:05:17,750
concessions that are going in are for

109
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,910
block 22 and this is something that the

110
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:23,410
Huaorani and other communities in

111
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:26,000
Alianza sabo and also neighboring areas

112
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:32,090
are trying very hard to resist and their

113
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:34,639
message is quite clear our message for

114
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:36,139
the oil companies our land is not for

115
00:05:36,139 --> 00:05:36,770
sale

116
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:42,080
and so here is a map that they put

117
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,550
together and I'm going to start to talk

118
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:46,130
about how this map was put together so

119
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:48,020
this map is really cool this is a map of

120
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:51,169
Huaorani traditional territory and here

121
00:05:51,169 --> 00:05:53,030
is a village this is an interactive map

122
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:55,520
that the Huaorani have chosen to publish

123
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,349
to share with the world hopefully to

124
00:05:57,349 --> 00:05:59,120
share with you you can see that there's

125
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,570
a lot going on in this map we've got

126
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:04,130
we've got the locations of important

127
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:07,430
plants for making thatched roof we've

128
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:11,419
got tapir tracks Jaguar tracks important

129
00:06:11,419 --> 00:06:13,430
medicinal plants here with a tree with

130
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:17,530
the plus where snakes sometimes occur

131
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:20,240
the locations of villages this one is

132
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,830
really cool you can't see it too well

133
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:25,340
but that's a cell phone icon and so this

134
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:27,710
is a location where you can pick up a

135
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:29,599
cell phone signal maybe you have to hold

136
00:06:29,599 --> 00:06:32,060
it in the air or maybe you have to stand

137
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:33,979
on top of a car to get it but you can

138
00:06:33,979 --> 00:06:35,330
get it and that's really important

139
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:38,150
because if someone in the community gets

140
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:39,680
a snakebite and they don't have any

141
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,110
anti-venom then they can call for a

142
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:44,449
helicopter to come in and hopefully save

143
00:06:44,449 --> 00:06:45,229
someone's life

144
00:06:45,229 --> 00:06:48,080
so this map is

145
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,759
there's a link to it in the in the notes

146
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:52,909
it's you can see this is quite full of

147
00:06:52,909 --> 00:06:54,830
resources but if you look on a

148
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:57,860
government map this area is empty they

149
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:00,440
don't put things like you know where

150
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:02,750
these important resources are on their

151
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:06,919
maps and this gives the Huaorani and

152
00:07:06,919 --> 00:07:08,240
other groups an important bargaining

153
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,090
tool for talks with the government to

154
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:13,669
stroh hey we are using this land for

155
00:07:13,669 --> 00:07:16,340
these important purposes and we don't

156
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:18,560
want this extractive industry to come in

157
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:28,849
and you know and harm us so for in terms

158
00:07:28,849 --> 00:07:31,159
of what technology is needed you know

159
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:34,780
technology in itself is only a tool for

160
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:39,050
informing these other processes like

161
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:41,389
local decision making like the community

162
00:07:41,389 --> 00:07:43,219
needs to be well-informed to have

163
00:07:43,219 --> 00:07:46,539
meetings like not only with external

164
00:07:46,539 --> 00:07:50,569
parties like governments but also for

165
00:07:50,569 --> 00:07:53,029
just you know having good information

166
00:07:53,029 --> 00:07:57,110
about your territory part of that is

167
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:58,819
gathering evidence like with smartphones

168
00:07:58,819 --> 00:08:00,740
looking at the locations of oil spills

169
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:03,560
and things like that or mining like

170
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:08,419
mercury equipment and also preserving

171
00:08:08,419 --> 00:08:10,250
traditional knowledge is an important

172
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:12,680
component of this especially with the

173
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:16,340
older generation passing on and the

174
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:18,050
younger generation in many cases

175
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:19,520
unfortunately moving to the cities

176
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,409
without without learning these things so

177
00:08:21,409 --> 00:08:25,219
technology tools are useful for kind of

178
00:08:25,219 --> 00:08:26,900
preserving that knowledge before it

179
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:31,940
might be lost so there's two main

180
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:33,770
components for these technology tools

181
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:35,539
there's the mapping components and then

182
00:08:35,539 --> 00:08:37,159
the environmental monitoring components

183
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:40,339
so for the mapping tools loading

184
00:08:40,339 --> 00:08:44,180
satellite imagery so that people can you

185
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:46,670
know trace our rivers and paths and the

186
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:47,899
locations the villages is pretty

187
00:08:47,899 --> 00:08:53,449
important and like I said paper maps are

188
00:08:53,449 --> 00:08:55,040
also a big important component of this

189
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:58,370
any maps that are made it's good to have

190
00:08:58,370 --> 00:09:00,380
a hard copy because hard copies work

191
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:01,490
very well offline

192
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:02,899
in these in these sorts of environments

193
00:09:02,899 --> 00:09:05,209
you can pass them out to families in the

194
00:09:05,209 --> 00:09:10,779
villages and you can also you know

195
00:09:10,779 --> 00:09:13,100
document the locations of important

196
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:15,950
traditional medicines or important

197
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:19,940
cultural cultural sites that's that sort

198
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:23,630
of thing so in in terms of environmental

199
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:26,450
monitoring that might consist of taking

200
00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:29,779
photos or taking video gathering GPS

201
00:09:29,779 --> 00:09:32,089
coordinates with GPS proper GPS devices

202
00:09:32,089 --> 00:09:33,860
and smart phones because the sensors

203
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:36,260
aren't quite as good and also taking

204
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:39,140
like quick notes either sometimes via

205
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:41,480
text but often voices is a bit easier

206
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:44,470
when you're out doing the field work and

207
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:47,240
some of the communities are also using

208
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:52,010
drones to do aerial surveys a big

209
00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:55,040
problem with this work which is sort of

210
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:59,120
what what I and what digital democracy

211
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,620
has been working on is kind of shoring

212
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:02,390
up the shortcomings with tools that are

213
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:05,930
broadly available so tool professional

214
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:08,060
GIS tools are quite difficult to learn

215
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:10,850
the learning curve is very steep they're

216
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:13,399
generally not collaborative so you know

217
00:10:13,399 --> 00:10:15,290
you can't involve a whole community or

218
00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:17,990
you can involve neighboring communities

219
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:20,500
in with a big group mapping project and

220
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:24,320
very often there are poor online

221
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:27,290
assumptions like some of the drone the

222
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:29,180
drone imaging tools require an internet

223
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:32,600
uplink for the purposes of you know

224
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:35,810
having a licensing tracker thingy and it

225
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:37,670
just doesn't really work very well if

226
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:41,360
you've got a really spotty solo signal

227
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,730
or if you have a satellite internet that

228
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:47,230
has an aggressive cap so there's also

229
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:50,000
power sources are a big challenge so

230
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,980
most of the villages have solar panels

231
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:55,190
and like many of family homes have small

232
00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:58,070
solar panels or people often like use

233
00:10:58,070 --> 00:10:59,839
their motorbike or they use their truck

234
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:01,970
to power like cell phones usually

235
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:06,079
sometimes small laptops internet access

236
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:09,650
is difficult it's quite expensive most

237
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:11,870
of the villages like in Guyana have a

238
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:13,480
village office that has a satellite

239
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:17,139
blink but they're they after you go over

240
00:11:17,139 --> 00:11:18,760
a certain point like 20 gigabytes it

241
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,560
just stops working completely so you

242
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,300
know if there's a new Android update

243
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:23,620
available and all of the phone's

244
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:25,600
individually download the exact same

245
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,180
data maybe like 20 times then you've

246
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:29,829
spent your whole cap for the month so

247
00:11:29,829 --> 00:11:31,990
it's it's quite challenging working with

248
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:34,180
those sorts of constraints and also the

249
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:36,040
devices themselves have to be quite

250
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:39,310
durable you might drop your phone in a

251
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:42,339
river or ants are a huge problem we have

252
00:11:42,339 --> 00:11:43,899
this problem on the Big Island - ants

253
00:11:43,899 --> 00:11:46,570
love electronics they live to like get

254
00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:48,279
in there and lay a bunch of eggs and

255
00:11:48,279 --> 00:11:52,990
I've had SDR card full of ants this

256
00:11:52,990 --> 00:12:00,339
happens quite often so these these tools

257
00:12:00,339 --> 00:12:02,019
have to work offline they have to be

258
00:12:02,019 --> 00:12:03,970
able to collect important information

259
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:05,680
and they have to be easy to learn and

260
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,329
that also means that they have to be

261
00:12:07,329 --> 00:12:09,100
easy to teach so these communities

262
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:11,980
ideally should be teaching each other

263
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:13,269
they shouldn't have to rely on these

264
00:12:13,269 --> 00:12:16,660
external parties to kind of come in and

265
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:19,060
swoop in and and do things that that's

266
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:22,870
not a very good way to set up this this

267
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:25,480
sort of a project which is anti-colonial

268
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,920
in nature so you really don't want to be

269
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:29,019
reproducing that kind of dynamic as much

270
00:12:29,019 --> 00:12:31,720
as possible and it's important too that

271
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,940
the map presets are based on local

272
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:36,670
knowledge so all of the maps in the

273
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:38,319
Huaorani map that i just showed you were

274
00:12:38,319 --> 00:12:40,029
designed by the local community on paper

275
00:12:40,029 --> 00:12:43,569
and then a designer came in and made SVG

276
00:12:43,569 --> 00:12:46,959
versions of those so here's a great

277
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:47,829
quote from Tessa

278
00:12:47,829 --> 00:12:50,769
who's the monitoring coordinator in

279
00:12:50,769 --> 00:12:54,639
Guyana for the septa technology changes

280
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:56,079
every day and I'd like to learn more

281
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:57,519
about developing software and writing

282
00:12:57,519 --> 00:12:58,930
commands because right now we are

283
00:12:58,930 --> 00:13:00,310
dependent on people coming from the

284
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:02,069
outside to do this for us

285
00:13:02,069 --> 00:13:04,930
it's kind of an important power

286
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:06,540
dimension to be aware of that

287
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:10,879
technologists have these skills that

288
00:13:10,889 --> 00:13:14,680
that put us in a position of privilege

289
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:18,880
and power and it's important to point at

290
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,500
that and think about how to remedy it

291
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:23,260
and Tessa is great and she's already

292
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:26,720
running Linux and learning programming

293
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,800
another important consideration with

294
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,079
this is that the data belongs to

295
00:13:31,079 --> 00:13:33,959
communities it's not the sort of we kind

296
00:13:33,959 --> 00:13:36,600
of have this idea of open data that can

297
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:40,259
be quite problematic if you're putting a

298
00:13:40,259 --> 00:13:41,970
sacred site on a map means that a bunch

299
00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:43,589
of vandals will show up which happens

300
00:13:43,589 --> 00:13:47,100
then or you know if you're pointing if

301
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:49,769
you're including the locations where

302
00:13:49,769 --> 00:13:52,139
gold can be found you certainly don't

303
00:13:52,139 --> 00:13:55,829
want to have a gold rush coming on to

304
00:13:55,829 --> 00:13:57,779
indigenous territory and causing all

305
00:13:57,779 --> 00:13:58,709
kinds of problems

306
00:13:58,709 --> 00:14:01,529
so it's important that the communities

307
00:14:01,529 --> 00:14:04,649
decide how their data is shared so as

308
00:14:04,649 --> 00:14:06,360
far as data transfer goes for these

309
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,999
projects there's of course the internet

310
00:14:08,999 --> 00:14:11,639
but it has caps with satellite service

311
00:14:11,639 --> 00:14:12,990
or sometimes cell phone service and

312
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:14,399
sometimes the cell phone service is

313
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:18,509
using the satellite network or people

314
00:14:18,509 --> 00:14:20,249
might drive into like the next big town

315
00:14:20,249 --> 00:14:23,129
like in to let them or into a town

316
00:14:23,129 --> 00:14:26,129
that's on the road system in Ecuador USB

317
00:14:26,129 --> 00:14:28,110
drives are fantastic way to transfer

318
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:30,899
data in these environments and our

319
00:14:30,899 --> 00:14:32,699
database our peer-to-peer database tools

320
00:14:32,699 --> 00:14:35,879
work really well with USB drives you

321
00:14:35,879 --> 00:14:37,290
might have a local offline router or

322
00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:39,809
Bluetooth or etc ADB is also a fantastic

323
00:14:39,809 --> 00:14:42,179
tool for communicating with an Android

324
00:14:42,179 --> 00:14:44,790
smartphone you can copy files and you

325
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:46,860
can do a lot of you can run unix

326
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:48,449
commands on the phone so we've been

327
00:14:48,449 --> 00:14:51,509
using that a lot to install to install

328
00:14:51,509 --> 00:14:53,819
the software onto the devices okay so

329
00:14:53,819 --> 00:14:56,100
why given all of that background context

330
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:59,550
why does peer-to-peer p2p makes sense

331
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:02,850
for this kind of a problem space well

332
00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:05,279
importantly there's no critical or

333
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:10,829
privileged devices so nothing that can't

334
00:15:10,829 --> 00:15:12,839
get lost in a river can't get covered in

335
00:15:12,839 --> 00:15:15,420
ants you know you have many devices

336
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:17,549
making writes offline and everybody

337
00:15:17,549 --> 00:15:20,819
every device has a backup and the

338
00:15:20,819 --> 00:15:22,649
devices can talk to each other in this

339
00:15:22,649 --> 00:15:24,089
kind of a network called the gossip

340
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:27,629
network in order to transfer information

341
00:15:27,629 --> 00:15:30,809
you have implicit backups and it's it's

342
00:15:30,809 --> 00:15:31,879
pretty great

343
00:15:31,879 --> 00:15:36,600
so the tool that I've been working

344
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:39,120
partly on mostly in the database layer

345
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:39,600
is

346
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,180
called Matteo it's for desktop and

347
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:44,430
mobile it uses ID editor which is a tool

348
00:15:44,430 --> 00:15:46,410
for OpenStreetMap and so the data model

349
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:48,870
for OpenStreetMap is used in ID editor

350
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:50,880
and we have some glares iOS and p2p DB

351
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:54,540
that use peer-to-peer techniques so just

352
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:55,769
to give you a quick idea of what that

353
00:15:55,769 --> 00:15:57,870
looks like here's a just a quick

354
00:15:57,870 --> 00:16:03,449
screenshot of the tool to make an

355
00:16:03,449 --> 00:16:05,220
offline peer-to-peer network you can use

356
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:07,290
this thing called a CAPA architecture

357
00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:08,930
that's where you have an append-only log

358
00:16:08,930 --> 00:16:11,279
tools like git have this sort of

359
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:13,440
structure internally also and you build

360
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,910
materialized views on top of that log

361
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:17,790
things that might be like a key value

362
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:19,860
store or a spatial index for mapping

363
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:23,250
data we use the Open Street Map model

364
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:24,930
because a lot of the tools are based on

365
00:16:24,930 --> 00:16:27,029
that so it has nose nodes ways and

366
00:16:27,029 --> 00:16:28,980
relations and here's some examples of

367
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:31,500
that we do have to kind of change this

368
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,540
model a little bit so for example IDs

369
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:35,490
you can't monotonically increase IDs

370
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:39,240
because two devices might try to create

371
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,980
the same ID so what you can do is

372
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:43,139
generate very long cryptographically

373
00:16:43,139 --> 00:16:47,189
random IDs instead for that versions

374
00:16:47,189 --> 00:16:49,230
also have a similar problem so you can

375
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:51,990
use the hash of the previous document or

376
00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:54,750
you can use the location in a in a

377
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:56,490
vector clock like the sequence number in

378
00:16:56,490 --> 00:16:59,459
your version entries and with this few

379
00:16:59,459 --> 00:17:02,639
small changes like this you can build

380
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:06,030
these kind of networks so awesome pizza

381
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:07,829
P was our first iteration it uses an

382
00:17:07,829 --> 00:17:10,199
appendant log based on this tool NPM

383
00:17:10,199 --> 00:17:11,939
module called hyper log and we have some

384
00:17:11,939 --> 00:17:14,850
materialized views for a KB store a join

385
00:17:14,850 --> 00:17:16,500
model that kind of lets you deal with

386
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,780
more normalized data like osm data is

387
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:23,819
and spatial index that kdb tree the

388
00:17:23,819 --> 00:17:26,189
thing is with peer to peer with this

389
00:17:26,189 --> 00:17:28,260
kind of gossip network right performance

390
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:30,690
is actually very important because every

391
00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:33,299
time that two devices sync up you have

392
00:17:33,299 --> 00:17:35,250
to write all of the records in and we

393
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:37,710
got to the point where with one of the

394
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:40,350
prototypes it was taking 15 minutes to

395
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:42,809
sync a database with about a quarter

396
00:17:42,809 --> 00:17:45,690
million records on it and so for the the

397
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:48,299
new version that's right performance has

398
00:17:48,299 --> 00:17:50,850
been really important and here's some of

399
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:51,980
the components in the new

400
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:57,110
version other future applications

401
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:59,570
include building unordered materialized

402
00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:01,549
views so things that were kind of out of

403
00:18:01,549 --> 00:18:03,590
order because that's useful if you need

404
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:06,160
to use encryption to kind of have a

405
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:09,200
sharing model that where you might want

406
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,059
to also have remote backups and not

407
00:18:11,059 --> 00:18:12,710
necessarily share that information with

408
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:15,919
the whole public so here in the in the

409
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:17,240
slide notes I'm gonna skip over this

410
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:19,549
real quick but have just a quick example

411
00:18:19,549 --> 00:18:21,200
of like how you can build this kind of a

412
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,080
key value materialized view if you're

413
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:27,110
interested and it's important to think

414
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:28,429
of it in terms of like you might think

415
00:18:28,429 --> 00:18:30,799
about it get repo where you can have

416
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:32,660
Forks of the data and then also tools

417
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:37,120
for merging the content back into place

418
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:40,520
spatial index are a big part of this

419
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:41,780
work because they have to work really

420
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:44,740
fast have to work really well offline

421
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:46,880
everything that we've done is built on

422
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,520
the debt project tools like hyper core

423
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:55,250
and random access storage modules and as

424
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:59,870
far as future work goes the sparse

425
00:18:59,870 --> 00:19:01,520
replication is also a big element of

426
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,230
this because as these databases grow

427
00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:07,040
then you can't store the entire database

428
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:11,660
on a single device so as far as future

429
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:13,669
work goes we've also recently got a

430
00:19:13,669 --> 00:19:16,280
grant for this other related project

431
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:19,850
called peer maps and this is matéo the

432
00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:22,730
tool also got a 50k grant from Samsung

433
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:25,400
so get to work on this more full time

434
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:28,580
and as far as the database go as far as

435
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:30,230
the project goes this is more of a tool

436
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:36,020
for building something that can take in

437
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:37,790
all of the planet awesome the

438
00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:39,770
OpenStreetMap data and kind of

439
00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:41,210
distributed over these peer-to-peer

440
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:43,040
networks in a way that's also going to

441
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:46,429
benefit the mapping work with matéo

442
00:19:46,429 --> 00:19:48,350
because a lot of the core components are

443
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:51,350
the same so and this is just a great

444
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:52,970
quote I wanted to end on this is from

445
00:19:52,970 --> 00:19:55,160
Opie our mapping coordinator I just want

446
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:57,980
to read it really fast we wrote you why

447
00:19:57,980 --> 00:20:00,380
Ronnie like my pay oh because it is an

448
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:02,059
open program and it's not too difficult

449
00:20:02,059 --> 00:20:04,400
to learn it's been really helpful to us

450
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,600
to allow us to manage or

451
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,190
mapping program and for the first time

452
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:09,020
people in all the villages including the

453
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:11,090
local technicians but also even the

454
00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:13,400
elders who don't speak Spanish or know

455
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,169
how to read have been able to understand

456
00:20:15,169 --> 00:20:17,390
it it is also the first program we've

457
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:19,490
ever seen where we can use our own icons

458
00:20:19,490 --> 00:20:21,200
for things and for it to be in our own

459
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,789
language rather than in English or

460
00:20:22,789 --> 00:20:25,280
Spanish with Matteo we have for the

461
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,900
first time a tool that we can use to

462
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:28,730
make our own maps and we can build a

463
00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:30,140
strong team of people who can train

464
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:32,360
others to map the mapping project has

465
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:34,190
United many villages to defend and

466
00:20:34,190 --> 00:20:36,470
manage their lands together and it is a

467
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:38,600
process which is leaving a legacy for

468
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,400
the future both the maps and the skills

469
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,440
that our people can use to fight for our

470
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:46,549
livelihoods and our rights and I have a

471
00:20:46,549 --> 00:20:48,200
bunch of links if you're interested in

472
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:52,100
more of the projects and also in some of

473
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:53,960
the activism here locally on Hawaii

474
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:56,450
that's indigenous life thank you very

475
00:20:56,450 --> 00:20:57,280
much
