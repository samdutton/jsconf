my name is Jennifer Dewalt I am from San

2
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:16,970
Francisco California in the United

3
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:20,420
States and I taught myself to code by

4
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:22,100
making 180 websites and a hundred eighty

5
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:23,840
days javascript was the first

6
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,430
programming language that I really

7
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:27,290
learned through the hundred eighty

8
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:30,230
websites project and most of the

9
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:32,239
websites that I did in that project use

10
00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:34,370
JavaScript very heavily although I did

11
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:38,329
use Ruby on Rails these days I do a lot

12
00:00:38,329 --> 00:00:41,810
of hacks using node.js and client-side

13
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:44,809
JavaScript working with hardware so I

14
00:00:44,809 --> 00:00:46,910
gave a talk about how I taught myself to

15
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:50,420
code by making 180 websites 180 days and

16
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:52,519
so I gave a little bit of a history of

17
00:00:52,519 --> 00:00:54,920
myself I came from a small farming

18
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:57,769
community and ended up studying fine art

19
00:00:57,769 --> 00:01:00,739
in school but after I graduated I

20
00:01:00,739 --> 00:01:02,690
realized that I wasn't content with just

21
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:06,950
using all these amazing web and Internet

22
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:08,360
products that I actually want to start

23
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:09,950
building them myself so I decided I

24
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:12,380
wanted to learn to code and I decided to

25
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:14,960
do a self-directed project where I would

26
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,580
make one website a day every single day

27
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:19,400
for 180 days so in my talk I went

28
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:21,920
through a handful actually 40 of my

29
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,200
websites that I made during that project

30
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,670
starting from the very beginning and

31
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:27,770
going to the very end of the project

32
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:32,060
exploring things like the toys games

33
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:35,780
data visualizations tools and even real

34
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:39,110
time communication apps so recently I

35
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:40,790
have been working for a company called

36
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:43,610
wits at AI and we make an API that makes

37
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:45,320
it really easy for developers to add

38
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:47,270
voice interfaces to their Internet of

39
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:50,030
Things products so I've been focusing a

40
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:54,320
lot on how JavaScript can be applied to

41
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:57,260
hardware and IOT devices to make

42
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:59,990
interfaces better and so I've really

43
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:03,110
focused on how the JavaScript is going

44
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:05,600
to grow alongside the Internet of Things

45
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,119
movement and I'm really excited to be

46
00:02:08,119 --> 00:02:09,140
kind of on the cutting edge of that
