00:00:15,379 --> 00:00:18,180

hello my name is common bond effing I'm

2
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:20,850
a front-end developer working on kendo

3
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:24,150
UI mobile at T lyric and today I'm going

4
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:26,040
to help you enter the dark forest of

5
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:28,619
mobile browser books and keep your head

6
00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:32,640
on you will need it later when you do do

7
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:37,510
you when you delve deeper alone

8
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,840
smartphones change the web landscape

9
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,600
they introduced smaller screens and weak

10
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:45,210
processors and to their exponential

11
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:47,670
growth Foster's the developers to

12
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:49,980
provide special treatment treatment for

13
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:53,579
them we grew to love them and support

14
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:57,980
them but it's a love-hate relationship

15
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:05,190
we love them and they hate us last year

16
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:06,870
there were at least three major

17
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:08,909
smartphone parroting systems on the

18
00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:11,909
global mobile landscape that's roughly

19
00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:14,130
amount for about eighty percent of the

20
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:17,250
market if we count symbian the number

21
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:21,090
grows above 19 the good news is that all

22
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:23,310
the major players are using the WebKit

23
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:27,149
engine and the bad news the engine and

24
00:01:27,149 --> 00:01:29,640
manufacture implementations vary a lot

25
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:33,469
as you can see from the table above

26
00:01:33,469 --> 00:01:35,880
features that supposed to work

27
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,860
everywhere are actually not supported on

28
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:40,469
some platforms every operating system

29
00:01:40,469 --> 00:01:43,170
vendor decides to what to include in

30
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:45,539
their web key distribution thus leading

31
00:01:45,539 --> 00:01:48,899
to such inconsistencies only the

32
00:01:48,899 --> 00:01:51,270
blackberry playbook OS to support every

33
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:53,700
feature from the ones listed above but

34
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,439
its market share is most likely below

35
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:59,700
five percent so to be sure that

36
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:02,729
everything works as you identity to test

37
00:02:02,729 --> 00:02:04,439
everything you create on every device

38
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:08,310
you can get your hands on but the coat

39
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:11,460
hat truth is far worse even unsupported

40
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:13,530
mobile platforms one of these features

41
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:16,620
can be close to Anu zabal how many of

42
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:18,270
you created the web application and

43
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:20,130
turned into strange or even impossible

44
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:23,070
issues that forced you to abandon the

45
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:26,100
original approach

46
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:30,500
some of you okay issues like slow

47
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,720
performance broken rendering missing

48
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,510
events freezes and crashes plagued the

49
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:38,300
mobile web development world and prey

50
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:42,050
upon our time in our money the most

51
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:43,820
irritating ones are the performance

52
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:45,680
issues without hardware acceleration

53
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,620
customs curling can't animations grind

54
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:51,709
to a halt fortunately all that is needed

55
00:02:51,709 --> 00:02:54,020
to speed up the rendering is a 3d

56
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:56,630
transform a carefully placed WebKit

57
00:02:56,630 --> 00:03:00,560
transform translate Z 0 such transform

58
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,750
chiggers card or acceleration on this

59
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:04,130
element and it's rendering gets

60
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:07,270
offloaded to the mobile GPU however

61
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:09,739
translate these becoming damnation as

62
00:03:09,739 --> 00:03:12,530
much as salvation welcome the new zoom

63
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:16,459
one of the mobile web among the many

64
00:03:16,459 --> 00:03:18,200
issues caused by hard acceleration are

65
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:21,020
these transforming bigger elements can

66
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:22,940
lead to bad performance and can break

67
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:24,640
the renderings of WebKit masks

68
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:28,160
especially on Android sometimes the 3d

69
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,959
transform is not enough to trigger

70
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:31,640
hardware acceleration on some platforms

71
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:35,330
and transforms also may lead to

72
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:37,370
artifacting can break form elements or

73
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:40,549
android versions before jellybean and

74
00:03:40,549 --> 00:03:42,650
finally 3d transforms do not work in on

75
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:48,019
droid 2 but what else work there I'll

76
00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:52,160
now go over this one by one first we

77
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,950
start with the performance issues

78
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:56,180
imagine this scenario you have a rather

79
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:58,579
large list of images on a page with the

80
00:03:58,579 --> 00:04:01,130
custom scroller to speed up the

81
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:03,320
scrolling we apply translate Z on the

82
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:05,480
list instead of speeding up the

83
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:06,890
scrolling gets much worse and you can

84
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:09,200
actually see part of the Patriots

85
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,110
drawing Queen scroll by the issue you've

86
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:15,950
just run into its code next exercise all

87
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:17,989
graphics chips have just exercise limit

88
00:04:17,989 --> 00:04:19,970
in when you reach it your texture is

89
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:21,910
split into several smaller textures

90
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:24,590
which are rendered separately resulting

91
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:26,600
in more calculations and generally worse

92
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,600
performance this especially visible in

93
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,990
high resolutions on ipad 3 as they're

94
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:35,360
the graphics chip has to move four times

95
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,010
more pixels per texture than on previous

96
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:39,889
models even though it's slightly faster

97
00:04:39,889 --> 00:04:42,379
even though the max texture size on iPod

98
00:04:42,379 --> 00:04:44,960
trees four times bigger it's two covers

99
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:48,770
only slightly more than the screen to

100
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:50,629
avoid this you need to use smaller

101
00:04:50,629 --> 00:04:52,370
elements that are sure to fit into the

102
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:54,529
texture size in this case apply the

103
00:04:54,529 --> 00:04:57,560
transform on the list items instead of

104
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:02,779
on the whole list for we already saw

105
00:05:02,779 --> 00:05:04,789
that most native smartphone browsers

106
00:05:04,789 --> 00:05:07,189
that webkit-based this may change in the

107
00:05:07,189 --> 00:05:09,409
future with Internet Explorer 10 and

108
00:05:09,409 --> 00:05:12,050
firefox mobile advancing but now it

109
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:13,400
drives the usage of some proprietary

110
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:16,340
WebKit functionality for instance WebKit

111
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:20,360
masks WebKit masks are just images with

112
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,949
alpha transparency which apply a

113
00:05:21,949 --> 00:05:24,080
non-rectangular clip mask on their

114
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,419
element they are supported in all mobile

115
00:05:26,419 --> 00:05:28,460
webkit-based browsers with the exception

116
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:32,719
of all blackberry OS with 70 versions in

117
00:05:32,719 --> 00:05:36,199
which they don't work at all how remiss

118
00:05:36,199 --> 00:05:39,259
that escapes me fortunately they do work

119
00:05:39,259 --> 00:05:43,219
okay in 60 and 71 however most issues

120
00:05:43,219 --> 00:05:45,020
with a bit masks you'll probably see

121
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:49,069
young in Android again 3d transforms in

122
00:05:49,069 --> 00:05:50,990
maths just don't get together there an

123
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:53,000
example applying WebKit back face

124
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,860
visibility on a must element in android

125
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:58,580
for results in a colored rectangle on

126
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:00,020
the other hand the plank WebKit

127
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:02,389
transform translate Z on a single mask

128
00:06:02,389 --> 00:06:04,629
element breaks all the masks on the page

129
00:06:04,629 --> 00:06:07,879
but wait there's more if you applied

130
00:06:07,879 --> 00:06:10,819
translate Z 0 on a container the masks

131
00:06:10,819 --> 00:06:13,310
inside it will work but the rest of the

132
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:16,219
mask will break and the best part all

133
00:06:16,219 --> 00:06:19,839
this may vary between Android versions

134
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:23,029
so to avoid breaking WebKit mass in

135
00:06:23,029 --> 00:06:25,580
Android you need to take extra care

136
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:27,139
where you apply them and preferably

137
00:06:27,139 --> 00:06:31,909
don't mix them with transforms with the

138
00:06:31,909 --> 00:06:34,129
advancement of HTML mobile applications

139
00:06:34,129 --> 00:06:35,750
and the usage of hardware acceleration

140
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:38,599
for better responsiveness the graphics

141
00:06:38,599 --> 00:06:40,849
chip is eating smart phone batteries

142
00:06:40,849 --> 00:06:44,569
somewhat faster an attempt to avoid that

143
00:06:44,569 --> 00:06:46,490
manufacturers sent operating system

144
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:48,469
vendors are limiting the CSS properties

145
00:06:48,469 --> 00:06:50,589
that trigger the hardware acceleration

146
00:06:50,589 --> 00:06:53,810
you probably heard that for iOS 6

147
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:55,910
but some soon did something similar in

148
00:06:55,910 --> 00:07:00,190
galaxy s3 the limiting more properties

149
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:03,230
turns out 3d transforms are not enough

150
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:05,680
to trigger hardware acceleration there

151
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,440
after some testing we were able to do so

152
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:11,150
with a transition of a transformed

153
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:14,000
tellement any children at least a little

154
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,290
even for one millisecond it's ugly but

155
00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:21,620
this works so to be able to turn

156
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:23,000
hardware acceleration in your web

157
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,270
application samsung galaxy s3 apply one

158
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:28,639
millisecond or shorter transition on the

159
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:31,040
transformed element but make sure you

160
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:34,010
don't activate accidentally for instance

161
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:35,840
you can use web controls asian property

162
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:40,790
to limit it several times I've run into

163
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:42,650
a heart reproduce problem on older

164
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:46,910
Android 2.3 it's really hard to

165
00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:48,919
reproduce but it usually happens when

166
00:07:48,919 --> 00:07:50,930
you have transforms applied in a webview

167
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:53,690
then you open a new activity with

168
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:56,060
another web viewing it and then later

169
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:59,450
closet the transformer on the page

170
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:01,789
afterwards are frozen they doesn't get

171
00:08:01,789 --> 00:08:05,060
updated on screen even though the page

172
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:07,520
on the read or no underneath works ok

173
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:11,840
and fires events so if you run into this

174
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,260
issue while testing your web application

175
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:16,970
be sure to remove old transforms before

176
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:19,039
opening the new activity and then you

177
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:24,169
cannot tell them again almost all modern

178
00:08:24,169 --> 00:08:26,419
mobile browser secluded support for

179
00:08:26,419 --> 00:08:29,419
html5 form elements like date and time

180
00:08:29,419 --> 00:08:34,039
Pickers for instance html5 form elements

181
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:36,349
were introduced in iOS 5 and blackberry

182
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:39,380
weighs 60 however the default Android

183
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:42,380
Browser didn't join the party we will

184
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:44,390
introduce from as the default browser on

185
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:47,240
Nexus 7 but mostly most of the jelly

186
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,680
bean phones out there are still using

187
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:51,920
the alternate browser which still

188
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,720
doesn't have support for html5 form

189
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:57,110
elements even the nexus l7 webview used

190
00:08:57,110 --> 00:09:00,620
in phonegap is no exception this leads

191
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:04,400
to another unfortunate conclusion if you

192
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,530
really want to use html5 five for

193
00:09:06,530 --> 00:09:07,580
Pickers

194
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:09,440
you will have to fall back to external

195
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,200
libraries for them or use simples of

196
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:15,930
type text with some kind of validation

197
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:18,620
you may have noticed to enjoy its native

198
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:20,450
browser that when you place an HTML

199
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:22,340
input on a page and focus it you can

200
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:25,970
style the focus state this happens

201
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:27,910
because it is not actually a state

202
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:30,380
Android surrenders and another input

203
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:32,990
this time native on top of the one in

204
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:35,480
the page this fake native element

205
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,880
possess your typing and sends it back to

206
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:40,520
the page you can easily observe that if

207
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,560
you know that the fake fake input

208
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,720
doesn't position correctly when the

209
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:48,980
original element is transformed hideous

210
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:51,290
disease you can avoid this in Android

211
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:53,960
for for a price you can use the

212
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,880
little-known CSS property WebKit user

213
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:59,410
modify to remove the fake input on focus

214
00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:02,630
however just work around that's kind of

215
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:06,140
a trade off custom keyboards like swipe

216
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:10,460
for instance stop working completely so

217
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:12,440
you must carefully carefully weigh the

218
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:17,270
processing cost of using that in Android

219
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:20,750
to the solution gets even uglier the CSS

220
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:23,180
property is not supported so the only

221
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:24,860
thing you can do to avoid the second

222
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:27,260
team put this translation of the input

223
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:29,360
container to get it out of the screen

224
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,510
and then return it back with absolute

225
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:35,480
positioning thus removing the fake

226
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:38,870
element don't translate the input itself

227
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:42,800
or there will be dragons the negative

228
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,600
effects of such work around or even

229
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:47,300
worse ranging from broken non-english

230
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:49,400
keyboards through most HTML inputs

231
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:52,070
turning to type text and to the ability

232
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:55,700
to type the number 9 why is that I don't

233
00:10:55,700 --> 00:11:01,100
know fortunately all this mess is fixed

234
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:03,080
in jelly bean but in the default browser

235
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:06,050
and in webview and we just have to wait

236
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:11,390
a few years for everyone to update if

237
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:13,040
you're building a single page web

238
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,110
application you surely need a way to

239
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:17,810
navigate in it unfortunately the history

240
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:20,150
op is not consistently supported by all

241
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:22,379
WebKit browsers

242
00:11:22,379 --> 00:11:24,459
for instance it doesn't work properly

243
00:11:24,459 --> 00:11:28,240
now s the plan including 4.3 well it

244
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,389
should work for your newer versions

245
00:11:30,389 --> 00:11:32,709
interesting though the history AP works

246
00:11:32,709 --> 00:11:36,190
ok in Android too contrary to everything

247
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:39,759
else the Gustav there it is broken

248
00:11:39,759 --> 00:11:42,910
Android three and four and traditionally

249
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:45,459
hashes also partially broken Android 4

250
00:11:45,459 --> 00:11:48,759
plus the others bar doesn't get updated

251
00:11:48,759 --> 00:11:50,920
every time well the location do updates

252
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:54,790
internally to avoid this mess better

253
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:56,560
don't use the history of before mobile

254
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,899
apps and she wit matures new sketches

255
00:11:58,899 --> 00:12:04,660
instead they are mostly harmless iOS is

256
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:08,170
no safe haven from strange and obscure

257
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:11,500
browser books non example of that is the

258
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:15,670
input label book on every other platform

259
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:17,319
if you click on even if you click on a

260
00:12:17,319 --> 00:12:19,360
label which is associated with an input

261
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:22,899
the input gets focused however in iOS

262
00:12:22,899 --> 00:12:25,180
this is not true nothing happens when

263
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:28,569
you click the label only unless it has

264
00:12:28,569 --> 00:12:32,680
an on-click event actually you can skip

265
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:35,050
the event an empty onclick attribute is

266
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:38,050
all that it takes even better if you

267
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:39,880
have a container around all your inputs

268
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:42,310
and labels you can add empty on click

269
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:44,589
attribute to it and all labels will

270
00:12:44,589 --> 00:12:49,689
suddenly start working the next issue is

271
00:12:49,689 --> 00:12:53,889
not really really an issue it's it is

272
00:12:53,889 --> 00:12:58,000
part of how modern browsers work when

273
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,680
you change your CSS style on element

274
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,930
with JavaScript the browser doesn't

275
00:13:01,930 --> 00:13:04,600
hurry a way to actually change it but

276
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:07,329
instead weights are some cycles for more

277
00:13:07,329 --> 00:13:09,490
such changes then groups them and set

278
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:12,730
them in one go however you sometimes

279
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:14,500
need to force the browser to apply the

280
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,959
changes before doing something else for

281
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:18,910
instance if you show an element and set

282
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:21,370
the transition and some Styles after it

283
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:23,709
they all will be set at the same time

284
00:13:23,709 --> 00:13:28,540
and the transition won't run so to avoid

285
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:30,430
that you can request the elements

286
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:31,839
computer style for the property or

287
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:34,120
setting or you can check one of the

288
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:34,960
elements dimension

289
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:37,870
like most a tweet for instance at the

290
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:39,130
browser will be forced to apply the

291
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:41,830
changes immediately in order to return

292
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:44,260
you the correct results you can now

293
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:45,940
safely trigger the transition and it

294
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:52,840
will run that was it we're back on in

295
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,430
the open and managed to escape the dark

296
00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:57,180
forest labyrinth of mobile browser books

297
00:13:57,180 --> 00:14:00,880
barely stumbling into a dozen of them

298
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,090
but the forest is deep and hungry and

299
00:14:03,090 --> 00:14:06,760
inviting and we know that we'll have to

300
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:09,280
venture alone into it at some point make

301
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:11,620
sure you prepare for every Jenkins armed

302
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:14,140
with sharp weapons like patience and

303
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:17,200
creativity or you can bring bring a

304
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,330
friend along for a guide like Kendra

305
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:22,750
mobile either way note that every

306
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:24,610
problem has a solution you just haven't

307
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:37,840
found it yet thank you if you have

308
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:45,139
questions

309
00:14:45,149 --> 00:14:47,140
could you tell me a little bit more

310
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:49,390
about the push their issues in Android

311
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:51,700
three and four plays the push state

312
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:55,209
teachers yeah well they mostly don't

313
00:14:55,209 --> 00:15:01,329
work again the the Dodgers bar is not

314
00:15:01,329 --> 00:15:03,820
updated but location changes internally

315
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:07,149
so if you click refresh refresh you'll

316
00:15:07,149 --> 00:15:11,860
be going somewhere else so again thank

317
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:17,170
you thank you for some interesting

318
00:15:17,170 --> 00:15:20,500
tricks and I was wondering uh as a

319
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:23,620
developer of Kendall you I how do you go

320
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:25,149
about to find all these things do you

321
00:15:25,149 --> 00:15:27,820
have like a hundred devices on a wall or

322
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:32,920
how does that work well we have about 20

323
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:35,560
devices different mostly Android because

324
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:38,050
they have most change changes between

325
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:40,660
them and in different versions different

326
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:44,470
things break so I'm about to start a

327
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:47,110
device lab an open device lab in Malmo

328
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:49,810
and we're just a bunch of guys

329
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:52,000
collecting devices and then sharing them

330
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,010
so that you can come and test your

331
00:15:54,010 --> 00:15:56,350
website on a bunch of devices at the

332
00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:58,000
same time and I think I would just

333
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,649
encourage people in the audience if you

334
00:15:59,649 --> 00:16:02,890
also feel they need to do the same thing

335
00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:04,660
then you know start your own device lab

336
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:06,399
or check it out maybe there's already a

337
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:09,880
device lab in your city because I mean

338
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:11,500
this is awesome and it's great that

339
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:13,810
you're actually doing this research by

340
00:16:13,810 --> 00:16:15,370
yourselves but I think many of us

341
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:18,130
developers we don't just we don't have

342
00:16:18,130 --> 00:16:21,399
the we don't own 20 devices and we're

343
00:16:21,399 --> 00:16:25,779
not going to pay for the 20 devices yeah

344
00:16:25,779 --> 00:16:28,270
thanks for your tips and I was also an

345
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:31,540
additional question just these tips are

346
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:33,760
there just inside of this presentation

347
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:37,209
or do have you collected these tips on

348
00:16:37,209 --> 00:16:40,690
others for there are several demos in

349
00:16:40,690 --> 00:16:42,760
the demonstration you can find them on

350
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:46,990
the site and we don't have a repository

351
00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:49,779
for them unfortunately we do have some

352
00:16:49,779 --> 00:16:51,550
workarounds integrated thinking we are

353
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:58,420
mobile they're in there in phonegap wiki

354
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:15,520
okay great more questions Thanks what

355
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,620
was the activity we're referring to well

356
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:21,069
talking about android browser thank you

357
00:17:21,069 --> 00:17:24,160
and sorry it was the microsoft tech

358
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:29,440
scanner it was it is a it's a kind of

359
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,870
cure code scanner which scans for

360
00:17:31,870 --> 00:17:36,940
microsoft tak colts and it later opens

361
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:40,720
webview which when you close it the

362
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:43,510
whole application freezes all right so

363
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:47,710
it was about web views the no it doesn't

364
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:49,360
happen if you don't open the web view

365
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:53,799
but i didn't reproduce it consistently

366
00:17:53,799 --> 00:17:56,290
with only opening her with you so i said

367
00:17:56,290 --> 00:18:07,139
thats it's not how to reproduce thanks

368
00:18:07,149 --> 00:18:09,460
okay I think we're good so thank you
