[Music]

00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:14,009
hello thanks for the warm welcome it's

3
00:00:14,009 --> 00:00:15,750
great to be here my first time visiting

4
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:17,970
Berlin as well so what a brilliant

5
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:30,310
occasion to be here and thank you

6
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:45,540
just one moment we will try this again

7
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:49,720
rias great so hi I am Sarah hey Gary I

8
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:51,850
am a web developer I work at the BBC

9
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:53,920
news it's been about a year and a half

10
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,290
I've been working there and it's my

11
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:58,000
first web development role so it's been

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,930
pretty fun pretty fun real severe so

13
00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:04,600
i've the project that I've been working

14
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:06,910
on for the duration of the my time there

15
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:09,160
has been the redesign rebuild of the

16
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:13,300
news front page so as pretty cool so and

17
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:15,520
what's been part of this is that there's

18
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,710
the whole set of the backend so it's a

19
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:19,390
reaction server side but also the

20
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:21,580
front-end so a whole new CSS framework

21
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:25,479
and setting up walls from scratch so I'm

22
00:01:25,479 --> 00:01:27,070
going to start with a little bit of a

23
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:30,160
question first off how many of you have

24
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:32,320
ever visited the BBC News website hands

25
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:36,250
up cool so that's pretty much one with

26
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:39,280
Trivedi and okay so and half again if

27
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,060
you've used it in like say the last week

28
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:45,310
okay cool see you also still good number

29
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:46,119
cool

30
00:01:46,119 --> 00:01:48,399
so just to give a bit of context is like

31
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:52,149
you're not alone there are 650 676

32
00:01:52,149 --> 00:01:54,910
million weekly visitors to the site and

33
00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:57,009
actually what surprised me when I first

34
00:01:57,009 --> 00:01:58,539
found out it's actually about around

35
00:01:58,539 --> 00:02:00,580
two-thirds of them from outside of the

36
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:03,369
UK so that song found that pretty

37
00:02:03,369 --> 00:02:04,840
surprising last time when I was looking

38
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:08,289
at with that so another question how

39
00:02:08,289 --> 00:02:10,990
many of you have ever visited one of

40
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:12,790
these web service sites

41
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:18,340
hands up okay I think one or two great

42
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:21,550
cool some more single people maybe great

43
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:24,700
so these these sites these are all

44
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:29,319
separate and new sites are around 29 of

45
00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:33,490
them and 29 different sites they have

46
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:36,370
different languages different kind of

47
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:39,340
news agendas and news stories being

48
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:41,560
shared on them and what's pretty cool

49
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,090
about them is that they're actually all

50
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:46,180
have a based on the same code base as

51
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:50,410
like the English recited so for example

52
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:52,300
under abuse among those the Spanish

53
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:54,400
language site and that's got around 16

54
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,629
million monthly visitors site

55
00:02:58,629 --> 00:03:03,260
so yeah so as a half around almost 60

56
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:05,420
million monthly visitors to all of those

57
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:07,969
sexes with nine different languages odd

58
00:03:07,969 --> 00:03:10,250
service sites and what's pretty cool is

59
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:13,189
that almost all of 99% of users are

60
00:03:13,189 --> 00:03:14,689
actually from outside the UK so

61
00:03:14,689 --> 00:03:17,980
interesting challenges there and and

62
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:20,150
what's pretty cool is that we're going

63
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:24,349
to launch a few more sites are very soon

64
00:03:24,349 --> 00:03:28,549
and we're in South of Asia and look

65
00:03:28,549 --> 00:03:30,680
through Africa as well so areas which we

66
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:34,819
had little connections bandwidth perhaps

67
00:03:34,819 --> 00:03:36,590
memory some slower connections and

68
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:38,299
things like that so really really

69
00:03:38,299 --> 00:03:39,650
interesting challenges in terms of

70
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:44,480
scaling to different regions and then

71
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,310
generally if you not just BBC news and

72
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:48,409
what service there's like other services

73
00:03:48,409 --> 00:03:51,019
so that do you see kind of losses or a

74
00:03:51,019 --> 00:03:52,579
night air and things and then there's

75
00:03:52,579 --> 00:03:54,709
this kind of really high target to kind

76
00:03:54,709 --> 00:03:56,599
of get some chance empty million like

77
00:03:56,599 --> 00:03:59,329
users worldwide so like within a little

78
00:03:59,329 --> 00:04:02,510
about five years or so so yeah so huge

79
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:04,340
numbers kind of difficult to kind of put

80
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:06,290
them into context so that's going to be

81
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:09,409
enough of this just the big statistics

82
00:04:09,409 --> 00:04:11,629
really and I'm just going to like just

83
00:04:11,629 --> 00:04:13,549
all that down to like what what that

84
00:04:13,549 --> 00:04:15,650
intro review about so lots of users lots

85
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:17,840
of pages what we really care about is

86
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,880
like reusing things so as you can

87
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,500
imagine like having lots of their sites

88
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,949
it's like it doesn't make sense to

89
00:04:23,949 --> 00:04:27,020
rebuild everything for for all of those

90
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:28,490
things it will be like a maintenance

91
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:29,539
nightmare

92
00:04:29,539 --> 00:04:32,930
so as much of a reusability that we can

93
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:36,289
get in our systems are better and want

94
00:04:36,289 --> 00:04:39,349
our sites be localizable which is so to

95
00:04:39,349 --> 00:04:42,830
be able to just change the script some

96
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:44,539
languages and things and to make them

97
00:04:44,539 --> 00:04:47,870
lightweight so especially for some of

98
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:49,520
the different regions that we're going

99
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,430
into where they're outside of Europe and

100
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:55,070
outs of the US and things that are slow

101
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:57,349
connections that we can can ensure that

102
00:04:57,349 --> 00:04:59,210
our pages are able to get to them as

103
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:03,380
fast as possible so and so these things

104
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:05,120
you might say thinking alright I'm not

105
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,740
actually working on a big site I'm

106
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:08,599
actually working on a breeze like like I

107
00:05:08,599 --> 00:05:10,040
don't have like 60 million

108
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:12,920
what is this like relevant to you how is

109
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:15,710
this talk actually gonna be relevant and

110
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:17,780
what I think more like the last three

111
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:19,610
are actually relevant to like no matter

112
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:21,680
what kind of site you're you're so well

113
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,260
could be thinking about kind of and in

114
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:25,760
terms of our little lightweight

115
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,980
lightweight like who doesn't want a site

116
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:29,690
that low class that's pretty liberal

117
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:33,590
user experience really feasible to our

118
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:35,300
player cave in this life that if you're

119
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:37,370
thinking you know the next billion users

120
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:38,720
are probably going to be in different

121
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,040
reasons why why wouldn't you want to

122
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,080
tabs be able to write some content

123
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,970
outside from your services to like

124
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:46,630
different in different languages

125
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:49,220
Andrey's ability like we want to make

126
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:50,870
our life easy right we don't want to

127
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:52,640
keep like building the same things over

128
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:55,160
and over again and if we can reuse

129
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:58,100
things that's just next mixing Center so

130
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:01,160
yes I think this although like the main

131
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:03,170
case I'm going to be talking about my

132
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:04,820
examples I'm going to be talking about

133
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:06,950
over out the BBC news site I think that

134
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:08,270
lot are there will be things that you

135
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:09,710
can take away to like whatever kind of

136
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:11,060
size of projects that you're working on

137
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:12,950
you know if there's like a Hobby weekend

138
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:16,790
thing as well right so that's a bit of

139
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:18,350
the introduction and this is kind of how

140
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:20,210
I'm going to talk through the rest of

141
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:23,240
this so I'm going to like introduce

142
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:25,970
brand sound so BBC Grand Stand is the

143
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:29,090
CSM framework that we've using and it

144
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:33,800
was actually built by BBC Sports so

145
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,800
separate team and the main creator Sean

146
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,890
bent he was he he thought that as well

147
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:41,810
and used for like live pages and things

148
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:44,750
which are kind of like line updates to

149
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:47,180
like sports events so you can get up to

150
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:49,310
the minute as assortments and then that

151
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:51,140
was like kids use the news and things

152
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:53,000
like that so we're like okay you use

153
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,700
really well we should like think about

154
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:58,220
reusing this for for our new sites in

155
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:00,560
general so that's the kind of background

156
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:04,040
so well I'll talk a bit about the ins

157
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:07,370
and outs of grandstand and then how it

158
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:10,370
has helped us to to ensure it to be like

159
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:12,500
a CSS for our site to be like

160
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:15,220
lightweight localizable reusable and

161
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:16,990
touching on at the end about how would

162
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:19,260
you actually go about building your own

163
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:23,020
yeah so how did you where would you get

164
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:25,870
started like can you just pick up grass

165
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:27,460
and use it or do would you actually need

166
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:30,100
to start from scratch so what kind of

167
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:33,250
all the topics we'll talk about soon so

168
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:38,110
grandstand yep so this is a kind of an

169
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:40,660
intimidating list okay you don't need to

170
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:42,310
know all of these things we kind of

171
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:43,540
going through them a little bit of time

172
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:45,580
I found it pretty difficult when

173
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:47,590
starting out understand like these

174
00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:52,510
abstract concepts and things so instead

175
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:54,040
of just kind of going through the

176
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,900
one-by-one and just talking about the

177
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:57,130
theory behind it all

178
00:07:57,130 --> 00:07:59,400
I thought I'd start off with examples

179
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,500
because I find it much easier to

180
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:05,200
understand things for examples alright

181
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,540
so as you surfaces like the front pages

182
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:10,060
we've seen years on some desk looks like

183
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:12,040
a bit more of an industry breeze that

184
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:14,260
will be a lot of people do that set

185
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:15,030
films

186
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:19,330
remember so let's actually look at three

187
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:21,550
different parts of the of the page

188
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:24,220
layout and this will three things up

189
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:27,610
close so the first one is like a live

190
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:30,250
poll so actually on that website it does

191
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:33,400
also it's got CSS animations the second

192
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,589
one is the timestamp soul or clock icon

193
00:08:35,589 --> 00:08:38,229
with like how long text saying how long

194
00:08:38,229 --> 00:08:41,760
ago the story replaced last updated and

195
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:45,120
finally like a media icon like media

196
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:50,440
play video icon with the heading so okay

197
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,760
you might look at these and think all

198
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,530
right so these are actually very

199
00:08:53,530 --> 00:08:55,360
different like the different colors this

200
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,430
like a different like and typography

201
00:08:57,430 --> 00:09:00,010
that the sponsor like the different

202
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:01,680
iPhones do like there's nothing really

203
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,839
similar with this but actually if you

204
00:09:04,839 --> 00:09:06,490
look kind of a bit closer you can

205
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:07,810
actually see that under the hood

206
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:12,430
counseling and there are similarities

207
00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:17,260
here so for example you'll see that

208
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:21,940
there is the text and to the left of

209
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:23,740
that there is an icon which is exactly

210
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:25,580
the same height as the text

211
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:28,190
in which some of that and it fit the

212
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:30,290
spacing between them right so that's a

213
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:31,930
very similar hand so that's like

214
00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:33,830
different components because ever

215
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:35,899
they're not nests they're not identical

216
00:09:35,899 --> 00:09:37,490
you know different styling some things

217
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:41,300
but other hoods those have a similar

218
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:44,209
base pattern so we can actually use that

219
00:09:44,209 --> 00:09:46,310
we can actually extract that out it's

220
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:48,620
like a bullet patterns school a bullet

221
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:50,690
pattern because like Phillip points

222
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:52,399
something so it kind of reminds you of

223
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:54,290
like kinda web came up some bullet

224
00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:56,050
points and all that kind of thing so

225
00:09:56,050 --> 00:09:59,779
yeah so what was this pattern a block of

226
00:09:59,779 --> 00:10:01,940
text icon with the same height of it and

227
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:04,670
space et and I'm so pretty pretty simple

228
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:07,160
but it's been used in multiple places so

229
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:11,660
actually this is this is the kind of

230
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:12,920
emblem atmosphere this is actually a

231
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:16,149
memetic of like what this grandstand

232
00:10:16,149 --> 00:10:20,720
framework allows us to do so we separate

233
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:25,100
out lookup of the abstract so what we

234
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:28,070
want is to make sure that component so

235
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:29,269
those three different components that

236
00:10:29,269 --> 00:10:32,390
look pretty different they you don't

237
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:34,190
actually repeat that CSS from the

238
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:37,160
structure all of the time so we pull out

239
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:40,520
the common part right so that's that's

240
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:42,200
the whole list of all everything can

241
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,480
grandstand and actually the bullet

242
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,070
pattern that we just looked at is an

243
00:10:46,070 --> 00:10:49,550
object it's it's it's basically it falls

244
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:52,430
under objects and actually there are 11

245
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:54,140
different objects in I had in the

246
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:56,089
network instead of going through all of

247
00:10:56,089 --> 00:10:57,529
them are just like refer you to the

248
00:10:57,529 --> 00:11:00,709
doctor because but I think swivel it

249
00:11:00,709 --> 00:11:02,660
happened kind of this is just the Matic

250
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:04,250
sort of one that's a flag so you can

251
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:05,930
have an image that makes the text align

252
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:07,670
of the middle because we know we don't

253
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:09,079
want to all center-aligned things

254
00:11:09,079 --> 00:11:11,390
basically all the time I hand we'd like

255
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:12,709
to just have something quickly to see

256
00:11:12,709 --> 00:11:17,500
you and breathe so there's the objects

257
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:20,420
before we go onto the next subject I

258
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:22,399
want to just have a look quick aside

259
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:25,760
that in grants and we want to namespace

260
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,459
all the things so what does that mean so

261
00:11:28,459 --> 00:11:30,399
you want to namespace all of our classes

262
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:33,019
you know we don't want to have a class

263
00:11:33,019 --> 00:11:34,430
name that actually conflicts with

264
00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:35,690
another class that's something that

265
00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:37,040
somebody else for a double go because

266
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,259
see yet so you know every

267
00:11:38,259 --> 00:11:40,199
class name in existence as enough edges

268
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:43,029
maybe maybe you do that's brilliant

269
00:11:43,029 --> 00:11:45,009
but I don't know working the blue team

270
00:11:45,009 --> 00:11:47,769
maybe I like say that I don't know

271
00:11:47,769 --> 00:11:49,749
exactly every class meeting but every

272
00:11:49,749 --> 00:11:52,749
other cumber member to member his room

273
00:11:52,749 --> 00:11:56,619
so so this is actually name spacing

274
00:11:56,619 --> 00:12:01,029
really helps so GF gfs so this is the

275
00:12:01,029 --> 00:12:03,160
kind of start of what we have the start

276
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:05,350
of our class name I've ever think in the

277
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:09,189
free book so first an and because we are

278
00:12:09,189 --> 00:12:10,959
dealing with like the absolutes a

279
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:13,949
pattern which is an object and we

280
00:12:13,949 --> 00:12:17,169
actually do fix it with GFO so when you

281
00:12:17,169 --> 00:12:18,879
look at the class in your email into

282
00:12:18,879 --> 00:12:20,709
your inspector or something like that

283
00:12:20,709 --> 00:12:22,479
you can you know exactly what it is it's

284
00:12:22,479 --> 00:12:25,629
like a person object happens and we

285
00:12:25,629 --> 00:12:28,209
actually use them so so there's a gso

286
00:12:28,209 --> 00:12:30,009
bullets and Lizzie assumes let's

287
00:12:30,009 --> 00:12:32,259
understand of the icon and there's also

288
00:12:32,259 --> 00:12:35,439
GSA's billet underscore text and all

289
00:12:35,439 --> 00:12:39,089
that so that's how it kind of builds up

290
00:12:39,089 --> 00:12:41,979
so okay those are our objects

291
00:12:41,979 --> 00:12:44,169
what else does grandstand have really

292
00:12:44,169 --> 00:12:48,249
what else can you use so there's a whole

293
00:12:48,249 --> 00:12:52,359
other set of paths called utilities as

294
00:12:52,359 --> 00:12:54,309
you might expect the chaotically you so

295
00:12:54,309 --> 00:12:58,449
it's the GS you starts off with all the

296
00:12:58,449 --> 00:13:02,220
classes start with the GS s you so

297
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:04,629
what's included so this link reads

298
00:13:04,629 --> 00:13:06,959
everything like margins padding slopes

299
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:10,929
display all of that why do we need to do

300
00:13:10,929 --> 00:13:13,359
that why can't we just just write by the

301
00:13:13,359 --> 00:13:15,939
name enlarge and write 15 pixels from

302
00:13:15,939 --> 00:13:17,199
all of that it's really straightforward

303
00:13:17,199 --> 00:13:21,489
right well what we want is we want to

304
00:13:21,489 --> 00:13:24,429
standardizing so for example margin

305
00:13:24,429 --> 00:13:27,249
right we've got GS um are large and

306
00:13:27,249 --> 00:13:30,089
right is short we want short class name

307
00:13:30,089 --> 00:13:34,869
cz and so when you add that GS um are to

308
00:13:34,869 --> 00:13:38,199
that like live the live pulse section

309
00:13:38,199 --> 00:13:41,109
and you get that full orange gap so that

310
00:13:41,109 --> 00:13:42,789
there aren't margin that the pair so

311
00:13:42,789 --> 00:13:44,259
it's pretty straightforward it just adds

312
00:13:44,259 --> 00:13:45,879
it to the you don't need to kind of

313
00:13:45,879 --> 00:13:49,070
write custom CSS for this particular

314
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:54,210
component to do that you and likewise I

315
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:56,460
mean it doesn't necessarily look look

316
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:58,770
the best idea to design here because I

317
00:13:58,770 --> 00:14:00,510
just wanted to show the same example but

318
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:04,230
if you change the GS um are two GS u ml

319
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:07,400
so margin left then it all put the same

320
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:11,850
margin on the other side so that's how

321
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:14,450
you can kind of look at them service

322
00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:17,070
that's just margin but they're the same

323
00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:20,070
kind of setup for padding like padding

324
00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:21,630
top and bottom and all that as well and

325
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:24,300
display display block and display:none

326
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:26,850
and relays as well so all of the things

327
00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:29,250
that you kind of need to to get get

328
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:33,990
running early so okay so there's the

329
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:38,810
utility now what assessable so we

330
00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:42,000
grandstand isn't just and like compiled

331
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,430
CSS is actually fast that we for

332
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:45,330
pentathol down

333
00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:50,010
and so what SAS tools well they have a

334
00:14:50,010 --> 00:14:51,900
lot like color variables and things so

335
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:55,320
we have like Evan which is like columns

336
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:58,260
dark very dark gray and you'll have mix

337
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:00,330
ins which I will talk about later and

338
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:01,740
how they are relevant and how they're

339
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:05,600
useful particularly related to

340
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:09,090
localizing localizing our grids and

341
00:15:09,090 --> 00:15:14,550
things so so ok the staff tools and then

342
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:16,110
there are like three other sections of

343
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:19,800
the parts of grandstand and I actually I

344
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,570
don't like technically like passive

345
00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:23,070
grandson activity grand centers though

346
00:15:23,070 --> 00:15:27,120
it built up but it's you can see the

347
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,010
select gel typography gel grid and gel

348
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:31,410
iconography so these are this like cool

349
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:32,940
the beauty like global experience

350
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:36,720
language and this is decided across the

351
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,820
whole organization safe knees for

352
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:41,220
iPlayer music all of the different kind

353
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:43,710
of big products of the BBC have decided

354
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:46,200
on like like a share typography a chef

355
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,600
grid system all of this so that there's

356
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:52,490
continuity between the site and so that

357
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:54,900
there is continuing with us throughout

358
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:58,790
the kind of BBC exterior

359
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:00,890
so that's what that means global

360
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:05,210
experience language so I'm a typography

361
00:16:05,210 --> 00:16:10,040
so we've got a census so the the UX

362
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:12,350
themes have got together and created

363
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:14,480
results out of typography what's pretty

364
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:17,750
cool about it is if you clicked into the

365
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:21,070
sunlight design systems and things it

366
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:23,480
decides is actually the pixel sizes and

367
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:24,770
the line height change at different

368
00:16:24,770 --> 00:16:27,230
break points so to enable you if you're

369
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:29,180
on the mobile to have a large enough

370
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:31,540
larger kind of size so it's clear

371
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:33,500
whereas if you're definitely probably

372
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,600
want it smaller so that so that's it

373
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:39,230
so so there's a lot a lot of works on

374
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:43,360
behind the scenes to to set us up

375
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:47,960
there's a job for it so if you use

376
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,730
different different observers just like

377
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:53,690
a percentage brave spirit which so but

378
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:56,210
you've got one column if extent two

379
00:16:56,210 --> 00:16:59,720
columns etc and we've got like set

380
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:02,000
gutters between them to make sure at all

381
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,880
of our libraries looks like unique

382
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:09,770
toothpaste and gel iconography so SVG

383
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:12,290
icons that shared across the board this

384
00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:15,110
is just a one very small selection there

385
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:16,940
are all sorts of different ones and like

386
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:19,640
every sport imaginable has an icon that

387
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:22,810
we use for uses in news we're pretty

388
00:17:22,810 --> 00:17:25,250
we're basically in use of some of these

389
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:26,990
for like videos audios images things

390
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:33,230
like that so okay so that was a bit of a

391
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:35,960
whistle-stop tour of different parts of

392
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:39,300
Grand Stand

393
00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:41,630
actually you might notice things just

394
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:42,920
rearranged a bit I talked to little

395
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,060
through them and like that particular

396
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:46,250
order because I thought that made more

397
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:49,100
sense in my head anyway and but actually

398
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:51,050
what Grand Stand the structure and

399
00:17:51,050 --> 00:17:53,480
grandstand is that you pull in all the

400
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:56,030
gel like Google and gel foundation so

401
00:17:56,030 --> 00:17:57,650
the grid photography item in the first

402
00:17:57,650 --> 00:18:00,740
and then you have your like your like

403
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:02,900
product specific things so the objects

404
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:05,810
in utilities afters and tassels that's

405
00:18:05,810 --> 00:18:07,220
the kind of

406
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:11,300
hierarchy of items and there is a much

407
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:16,130
much more detailed like write-up of why

408
00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:18,820
this is kind of like inverted triangle

409
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:22,010
CSS and how roberts has given numerous

410
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:24,080
talks on that so do recommender I'll

411
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,570
sort of share the notes and slides of

412
00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:30,890
that so to explain why a particular our

413
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:34,120
Iraq is needed when you're reporting in

414
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:35,300
okay

415
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:36,680
so we've talked about all of you

416
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:39,080
separately right okay there's typography

417
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:41,300
classes and all of these things well how

418
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:42,710
did you actually build a page with them

419
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:44,810
how do you build build components so

420
00:18:44,810 --> 00:18:49,400
that you need to make a site lookit you

421
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,570
need to first make sure that these

422
00:18:50,570 --> 00:18:54,530
classes don't really overlap because if

423
00:18:54,530 --> 00:18:56,660
you have lots of classes that kind of do

424
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:58,250
the same thing that's kind of overwrite

425
00:18:58,250 --> 00:18:59,960
each other then you just end up there's

426
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:02,480
a little bit of a muddle and it takes a

427
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:05,200
while to for all the specificity stuff

428
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:08,420
try to avoid conflicts especially if you

429
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:10,780
see as much as we can so just go with

430
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:13,100
things that the class society you don't

431
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:16,610
overlap so when we actually implement

432
00:19:16,610 --> 00:19:20,060
them you can add these kind of classes

433
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:22,280
and different combinations that builds

434
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:24,650
up your components so what does actually

435
00:19:24,650 --> 00:19:29,240
mean so for example here this is like

436
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:32,810
example headline for example and the

437
00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:35,570
font so the gel will salute gel is the

438
00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:37,520
prefix for like the typography and

439
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:38,120
things like that

440
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:40,250
which is let's base in jail so gel

441
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:42,110
Waterloo is the typography size and

442
00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:43,820
there's the bullet pattern because you

443
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:45,590
have the bullet icon in your text and

444
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:47,450
there's a marginal write to seem like

445
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:49,460
the live path as we like

446
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:51,620
so before there's like a lot of space

447
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:53,840
there thank you great so you've got this

448
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,790
for like save the main heading of your

449
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:57,980
server your main page but what if you

450
00:19:57,980 --> 00:19:59,780
wanted like a small heading further down

451
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:02,720
do you need to actually redo this

452
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,640
component but with a smaller typography

453
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:07,670
and actually you do all you really need

454
00:20:07,670 --> 00:20:10,130
to do is you replace that one class the

455
00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:11,810
one typography class you replace the

456
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:12,590
dill

457
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:16,010
what's a little Vidal pica and it just

458
00:20:16,010 --> 00:20:16,720
gets down

459
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,940
perfectly and it'll work so some

460
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:20,559
breakfast so you can actually just reuse

461
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:23,289
something we're just replacing that one

462
00:20:23,289 --> 00:20:29,470
class okay so that was a bit about how

463
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:32,440
you build up things now we're talking a

464
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:34,360
bit more about how you can actually

465
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:45,309
localize the system right so what does

466
00:20:45,309 --> 00:20:48,909
the localization actually mean okay so

467
00:20:48,909 --> 00:20:50,860
you might think okay if it need to me

468
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:52,330
like as I need to write write stuff in a

469
00:20:52,330 --> 00:20:53,679
different language what content needs to

470
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:55,780
be perhaps a different language so you

471
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:58,419
might have your navigation saying like a

472
00:20:58,419 --> 00:21:00,280
home busing rules their home is in the

473
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:02,860
difference which Anu you might have a

474
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:04,169
different script UMass different

475
00:21:04,169 --> 00:21:08,590
typography if your writing so for

476
00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:10,630
example the BBC Arabic site has an

477
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:14,350
Arabic script so that's different and

478
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:16,720
layout so you might think okay wait wait

479
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:17,980
a minute why doesn't my whole layout

480
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:20,350
interchange that makes no sense I would

481
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:22,120
just rather have one layout and for it

482
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:24,340
to just work for everything that's

483
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:26,590
almost true that's why you can't do that

484
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:28,590
in lots of different circumstances

485
00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:31,870
except some languages are right-to-left

486
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:33,789
and not just right and you might have

487
00:21:33,789 --> 00:21:36,130
hard-coded margin-left everywhere so

488
00:21:36,130 --> 00:21:38,380
what do you do if something like that

489
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:40,510
just a bit like like how can you can

490
00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:42,250
change this it's a property like how can

491
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:45,130
I have can you handle that so so it sort

492
00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:46,570
through different different kind of

493
00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:48,669
issues that are here and how with

494
00:21:48,669 --> 00:21:50,440
grandstand so you can resolve that you

495
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:55,330
can solve them okay so first I'll show

496
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:57,789
you what it what the result is so these

497
00:21:57,789 --> 00:21:59,919
are like these slices of content so the

498
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:02,169
top line is in Thai and from Thai site

499
00:22:02,169 --> 00:22:05,320
and the bottom one is impatient to meet

500
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:08,700
steep Asian yes and then you can you can

501
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:11,500
for all the different kind of products

502
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:13,679
that you that we have the web service

503
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:17,409
sites you can also create places so you

504
00:22:17,409 --> 00:22:20,590
might notice that ty is left to right

505
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:23,020
that's a heading there and the person

506
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:25,330
one is right to left so it looks kind of

507
00:22:25,330 --> 00:22:25,840
thing

508
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:29,470
but you know under the hood they are

509
00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:31,750
slightly different and let's talk about

510
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:35,860
why so so the first point on

511
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:38,020
localization was type what something

512
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:41,530
with typography life okay so let's look

513
00:22:41,530 --> 00:22:44,440
at these two examples one less is in

514
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:46,060
English and then the one on the right is

515
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:48,910
in Persian they have the same font size

516
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:50,980
they have the same line height they have

517
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:54,000
the same all of that however if you read

518
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,710
through both languages you'll notice

519
00:22:56,710 --> 00:22:59,800
that it's actually much harder to read

520
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,960
the text on the right because of the

521
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:04,270
style of the type of real word you need

522
00:23:04,270 --> 00:23:06,160
to kind of focus a lot more and it's

523
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,810
just it's really like bunched together

524
00:23:07,810 --> 00:23:10,180
and things like that so it's more as a

525
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:12,760
as a reader of that type by by just

526
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:17,230
having the typography that works well in

527
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:19,180
English and for latin scripts with the

528
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:21,070
spacing between letters and pay online

529
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:23,410
and that doesn't really work when you've

530
00:23:23,410 --> 00:23:26,650
got different different scripts so it

531
00:23:26,650 --> 00:23:29,140
wouldn't work for a locker sort four or

532
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:31,780
four become things and for us are the

533
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:33,070
scripts so we've got different them

534
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:35,260
Chinese and Japanese and all sorts of

535
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:37,500
different scripts that we care about so

536
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:40,660
what do you do

537
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:43,240
so you actually adapt them depending on

538
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:47,920
with what setup cube if you decide okay

539
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:53,340
now I'm actually I want the Latin CSS

540
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:56,590
file and what can I do to get that right

541
00:23:56,590 --> 00:24:00,670
and if I want the Arabic script CSS what

542
00:24:00,670 --> 00:24:03,460
do I do to get that right there are a

543
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:05,680
few different things so the line Heights

544
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:08,800
font sizes and H breakpoints so what we

545
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:12,430
do in practice is that developers and UX

546
00:24:12,430 --> 00:24:15,130
designers less closely and usually with

547
00:24:15,130 --> 00:24:18,010
editorial staff so because not everybody

548
00:24:18,010 --> 00:24:21,370
in as multilingualism some of the team

549
00:24:21,370 --> 00:24:24,160
are not everyone speaks all 29 of the

550
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:26,620
languages so it's usually best to get

551
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:27,970
somebody from editorial you actually

552
00:24:27,970 --> 00:24:29,680
speaks language to come out and give

553
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:31,960
their opinion on whether it's clear or

554
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:34,730
not so yes so that

555
00:24:34,730 --> 00:24:37,130
so to get actual feedback woman is this

556
00:24:37,130 --> 00:24:38,600
clear enough can you see it well in your

557
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:42,470
salon you're fit mobile phone so we

558
00:24:42,470 --> 00:24:47,540
localize typography sir so about the

559
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:50,090
grid what does that mean to localize a

560
00:24:50,090 --> 00:24:53,450
grid so you might have noticed ferns in

561
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:55,220
Seleucia certain grants are definitely

562
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:57,110
in the grid we've got direction left to

563
00:24:57,110 --> 00:25:00,830
right and we have text-align:left to

564
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:02,240
make sure the text is aligned properly

565
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:05,270
to the side of the side of the page side

566
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:08,929
of what block but what do you do when if

567
00:25:08,929 --> 00:25:10,970
you want to create if you want to just

568
00:25:10,970 --> 00:25:12,799
swap it so that the fifth component

569
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:15,679
works with everything on the right well

570
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:17,929
what we use and we have users not

571
00:25:17,929 --> 00:25:19,820
specific grants and we use the elf

572
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:21,410
flower and the previous iterations of

573
00:25:21,410 --> 00:25:24,530
the site but it is in Gulu included here

574
00:25:24,530 --> 00:25:27,340
in grandstand is this the split function

575
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:31,850
so it's it's the function that you it

576
00:25:31,850 --> 00:25:35,030
takes two parameters if it's like if the

577
00:25:35,030 --> 00:25:37,760
site is left to right which is in most

578
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:40,220
of our sites are like the all but four

579
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:43,130
of them all over so like 20 25 of the

580
00:25:43,130 --> 00:25:45,080
sites are left to right so we kind of

581
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:47,929
default to that being the main default

582
00:25:47,929 --> 00:25:51,080
selector right system and if it's not if

583
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:53,780
it's right to left so that Arabic pêche

584
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:58,100
do and will do and Persian and then we

585
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:01,820
choose the value the second value second

586
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:04,429
argument so this is a function as a

587
00:26:04,429 --> 00:26:06,590
whole so takes two values in if

588
00:26:06,590 --> 00:26:09,440
right-to-left is true then return the

589
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,679
right to left value in all other cases

590
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:14,570
you return the first one so so just like

591
00:26:14,570 --> 00:26:17,809
a single like if statement since to make

592
00:26:17,809 --> 00:26:21,700
that work and that is really useful so

593
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:24,650
so yeah so so basically that will double

594
00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:28,010
flip so all of your values you can flip

595
00:26:28,010 --> 00:26:30,130
them around so they work out of the box

596
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:32,840
but what happens to properties well if

597
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:34,220
you've actually got a property with

598
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:39,219
margin right how do you make that work

599
00:26:39,229 --> 00:26:43,159
so in a school setting you use that

600
00:26:43,159 --> 00:26:44,389
right to left is false

601
00:26:44,389 --> 00:26:46,849
initially for example and the margin

602
00:26:46,849 --> 00:26:49,190
right value start off with for example

603
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:53,029
is this margin right and if if it's

604
00:26:53,029 --> 00:26:55,429
actually right to left so in an Arabic

605
00:26:55,429 --> 00:26:57,440
case or for personal cases or all of

606
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:59,779
these cases it just flips the value

607
00:26:59,779 --> 00:27:02,389
around so that value becomes the the

608
00:27:02,389 --> 00:27:05,539
opposite story and that just kind of

609
00:27:05,539 --> 00:27:09,619
works which is cool and so yeah so same

610
00:27:09,619 --> 00:27:11,629
with margin same with padding you just

611
00:27:11,629 --> 00:27:14,809
you interpolate it with that syntax so

612
00:27:14,809 --> 00:27:17,509
the hash brackets telephones and and

613
00:27:17,509 --> 00:27:22,279
then it works that way so those are the

614
00:27:22,279 --> 00:27:24,649
two ways the first one is to have in

615
00:27:24,649 --> 00:27:26,059
something the value is the second one is

616
00:27:26,059 --> 00:27:28,159
how to interpret for properties to

617
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:33,440
localize them cool ok so let's talk

618
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:37,609
about how it can be localized a little

619
00:27:37,609 --> 00:27:39,619
bit of that reusability and the

620
00:27:39,619 --> 00:27:41,839
lightweight being lightweight because

621
00:27:41,839 --> 00:27:43,489
we're reusing all of these classes they

622
00:27:43,489 --> 00:27:44,509
don't overlap so you don't need to

623
00:27:44,509 --> 00:27:47,359
override a lot of things all the time ok

624
00:27:47,359 --> 00:27:50,299
so that's a bit of a tour about that how

625
00:27:50,299 --> 00:27:51,859
do you actually get started building

626
00:27:51,859 --> 00:27:54,139
your own and why would you want to build

627
00:27:54,139 --> 00:27:55,729
your own can't you just use this out of

628
00:27:55,729 --> 00:27:59,329
the box well a lot of stuff you can some

629
00:27:59,329 --> 00:28:00,979
of the colors say you might not want to

630
00:28:00,979 --> 00:28:04,249
start your sites the BBC News red you

631
00:28:04,249 --> 00:28:06,709
might want to have your own colors or

632
00:28:06,709 --> 00:28:08,929
the object patterns you you might

633
00:28:08,929 --> 00:28:11,359
realize when looking at the style of

634
00:28:11,359 --> 00:28:13,009
designs that you that you want to have

635
00:28:13,009 --> 00:28:15,409
on your site that you don't really have

636
00:28:15,409 --> 00:28:17,959
lots of I con next to text that you have

637
00:28:17,959 --> 00:28:20,149
you have lots of images next to like big

638
00:28:20,149 --> 00:28:21,769
chunks of text although just lot it

639
00:28:21,769 --> 00:28:23,599
something else that you might want to

640
00:28:23,599 --> 00:28:25,429
abstract into it into a different

641
00:28:25,429 --> 00:28:27,289
pattern you just basically look at what

642
00:28:27,289 --> 00:28:29,749
you what you want to use a lot and

643
00:28:29,749 --> 00:28:33,979
decide what patterns are worth pulling

644
00:28:33,979 --> 00:28:38,089
out so that they're reusable ok so

645
00:28:38,089 --> 00:28:39,650
building your good

646
00:28:39,650 --> 00:28:42,890
jaren grandstand so to set up it's

647
00:28:42,890 --> 00:28:44,960
really cool really important and free

648
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:47,870
useful she set the standard spacing unit

649
00:28:47,870 --> 00:28:53,510
so no more one pixel Edison yes this has

650
00:28:53,510 --> 00:28:55,820
been a bit of a point of contention but

651
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:57,440
everyone's now kind of slightly on board

652
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,150
because it becomes more more unified

653
00:28:59,150 --> 00:29:00,800
across across different pages and

654
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:04,120
different components just good

655
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:06,020
breakpoints on time for presenting this

656
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:07,280
will this would be like a whole other

657
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:09,170
tool in itself and probably somebody who

658
00:29:09,170 --> 00:29:11,120
will they use experience to have a

659
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:14,210
background it will be best to let safe

660
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:16,550
to talk about it but really you'd want

661
00:29:16,550 --> 00:29:18,320
to have very points that are suited to

662
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:20,750
your context so if you've got lots of

663
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:23,450
text that that you break it up in

664
00:29:23,450 --> 00:29:26,870
there's enough as enough of spacing

665
00:29:26,870 --> 00:29:30,140
between the two even lines of text and

666
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:32,390
things like that so that's like a whole

667
00:29:32,390 --> 00:29:35,270
arts and science in itself and your

668
00:29:35,270 --> 00:29:37,429
color palettes so yes you don't want to

669
00:29:37,429 --> 00:29:39,320
just be clumps with the BBC news read as

670
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:42,080
much as everybody I'm sure loves it you

671
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:45,650
you feel choose your own right and for

672
00:29:45,650 --> 00:29:47,600
localization then you'll have the

673
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:50,450
traffic census variables and typography

674
00:29:50,450 --> 00:29:53,809
sizes styles and sizes so the things we

675
00:29:53,809 --> 00:29:56,300
talked about you can just use the ones

676
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:58,220
from grandson come over because they

677
00:29:58,220 --> 00:29:59,600
should be just like a little box for

678
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:05,059
your posts as well right and kind of sum

679
00:30:05,059 --> 00:30:07,670
over how to make sure you keep it

680
00:30:07,670 --> 00:30:08,360
lightweight

681
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:10,610
I think this is very important because

682
00:30:10,610 --> 00:30:13,280
and we we start off with the system it's

683
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:16,370
very sensitive easy to to just keep

684
00:30:16,370 --> 00:30:17,960
adding to it because you like great it

685
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:20,480
works it's awesome let's just go any I

686
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:21,890
thought this other use case let me just

687
00:30:21,890 --> 00:30:24,380
add that one thing and all that's like a

688
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:25,820
few months later there's another you see

689
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:27,500
it let me add that other one thing and

690
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:29,840
then it could end up being a really not

691
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:31,730
lightweight this sort of pretty heavy

692
00:30:31,730 --> 00:30:36,110
assistance so so really the discussions

693
00:30:36,110 --> 00:30:38,420
to have and I do say discussions even if

694
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:41,780
it is as to yourself or with other

695
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:43,940
teammates as do you really need that

696
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:45,740
extra variation is there any way that

697
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:47,330
you can use the current building blocks

698
00:30:47,330 --> 00:30:49,590
to get close to what you need

699
00:30:49,590 --> 00:30:54,140
and and finally and I think most

700
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:56,520
importantly is communicating with others

701
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:59,160
so if you're a developer to communicate

702
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:02,040
constantly into the designers and a

703
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:04,440
product advocate your users so in our

704
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:05,940
case that can be editor or it can be

705
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:09,810
like like you us users and can you think

706
00:31:09,810 --> 00:31:13,470
you taking on feedback and even if you

707
00:31:13,470 --> 00:31:15,780
are actually working by yourself and

708
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:18,510
it's their own project communicating to

709
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:22,890
future you if such an important and it's

710
00:31:22,890 --> 00:31:24,840
such an important thing and I don't

711
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:28,680
think can be like overestimated business

712
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:31,470
because you will write a class you will

713
00:31:31,470 --> 00:31:33,510
add something to add ie 11 support and

714
00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:35,610
you will forget six months down the line

715
00:31:35,610 --> 00:31:37,230
if you don't add a comment next to it

716
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:38,730
and you'll be like why do I need this I

717
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:40,470
should remove this to cake mix my CSS

718
00:31:40,470 --> 00:31:43,040
lightly and you break I 11 support so

719
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:46,050
yes so we definitely like to communicate

720
00:31:46,050 --> 00:31:48,930
to our future selves so we add comments

721
00:31:48,930 --> 00:31:50,250
and things throughout our code and

722
00:31:50,250 --> 00:31:53,340
install that helps of onboarding us last

723
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:55,020
so so many members of your team and

724
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:56,220
things or if you want to share your

725
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:58,140
project with other people online and

726
00:31:58,140 --> 00:32:00,060
that they can understand that you're

727
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:01,560
coming from on what the citizens you've

728
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:06,410

730
00:32:09,210 --> 00:32:11,790

00:32:11,790 --> 00:32:13,860
different sections and and why they're

00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:18,000

733
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,490

734
00:32:20,490 --> 00:32:22,080
