00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:03,060

Hey yeah thanks everyone

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:04,350
uh yeah so my name's Bryan Hughes

3
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:06,299
Technical Evangelist at Microsoft like

4
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:08,580
Vanessa said you can find me at neveri

5
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:10,349
us on Twitter github and basically

6
00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:12,509
everywhere else and so today I'm gonna

7
00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:15,150
talk about basically like privilege and

8
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:17,279
tech and kind of really boiling that

9
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:20,100
down and looking at how that works and

10
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:21,660
kind of what we can do about it now a

11
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:23,100
question you might be asking yourself

12
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:25,650
though before I get into that is why me

13
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:27,570
why am I actually here talking to you

14
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:29,519
about this today you know especially as

15
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:32,969
someone who is pretty privileged you

16
00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:34,950
know it's a good question to ask and I

17
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:38,820
think two key reasons one is that well

18
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:40,950
I'm bisexual and I'm an atheist and I

19
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:42,600
was also born and raised in multiple

20
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:45,539
places in Texas which is one of the most

21
00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:47,489
conservative places in the entire United

22
00:00:47,489 --> 00:00:49,620
States one of the cities I lived in was

23
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:50,899
actually ranked as the second most

24
00:00:50,899 --> 00:00:53,039
conservative city in the entire country

25
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:55,530
so I let you piece together what that

26
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:57,210
was like growing up it was not pleasant

27
00:00:57,210 --> 00:00:59,670
let's just say a little more recently

28
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:01,050
though I was involved in the node.js

29
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:03,030
project for about two years where I

30
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:05,040
focus specifically on diversity and

31
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,500
inclusivity and the project I helped to

32
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,270
found the inclusivity working group

33
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:11,189
which was the first group that kind of

34
00:01:11,189 --> 00:01:13,650
was working on culture and then later on

35
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:15,960
as we kind of restructured some things I

36
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,640
helped to found the community committee

37
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,170
which is the current group that is

38
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:21,479
responsible for culture in the project

39
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:24,060
as well as a number of other things so I

40
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:25,590
like to think that I've learned a few

41
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:27,720
things along the way throughout all this

42
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:32,130
process right so privilege this is a

43
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:33,990
topic that gets in a word that gets

44
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:37,110
thrown around quite a bit and sometimes

45
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:39,390
the ingenuously sometimes in less

46
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:41,670
tenuous ways shall we say and I think

47
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:42,810
there's a lot of misconceptions about

48
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:45,450
what it is and what it represents so

49
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:47,189
want to spend some time boiling that

50
00:01:47,189 --> 00:01:48,720
down it just really talking about what

51
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,009
it actually means in the way it

52
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:53,310
manifests itself and I'm gonna do so by

53
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:55,950
making analogies with bug reports

54
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:57,630
actually because I think they're as it

55
00:01:57,630 --> 00:01:58,710
turns out are actually quite a few

56
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:02,100
similarities so this is a problem that

57
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:03,329
we tend to have a lot let's say we've

58
00:02:03,329 --> 00:02:05,399
got a user they're using you know our

59
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:07,590
product or say or managing an open

60
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:09,660
source project and so these users are

61
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:11,520
using our library so they try and use

62
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,160
this thing and they run into problems

63
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,480
they get a cryptic error message when

64
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,490
they try to log in to a site maybe the

65
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:19,500
library is crashing on startup you know

66
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,900
whatever it is something got in the way

67
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:23,280
a bud got in the way of the user being

68
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,610
able to use our product and so you know

69
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:27,810
this is bad enough that they go and they

70
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:30,030
file a support issue or they open an

71
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:31,890
issue on github and they say hey I'm

72
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:33,510
trying to use your thing and it's not

73
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:36,180
working so you is the engineer you know

74
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:37,950
you pick up this bug and you go and you

75
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:39,810
try to reproduce it so you know you

76
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:41,460
follow the same steps they did to get to

77
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:44,010
it and well it just works for you

78
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:46,410
right you can't reproduce this bug at

79
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:48,600
all it works on your machine so mark the

80
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:51,270
bug as closed can't reproduce and move

81
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:54,090
on we've all been there I have certainly

82
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:55,590
done that a number of times in my

83
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:57,720
engineering career so far but there's

84
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,480
like two sort of simultaneous truths

85
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,500
that I think are important to keep in

86
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,750
mind the first one is that it's true it

87
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:04,410
worked

88
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:06,420
for you like you know it worked on our

89
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:08,760
machines and so you know we are not

90
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,530
encountering that bug ourselves like

91
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:12,870
that is absolutely true the other thing

92
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:14,670
that is also true at the same time is

93
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:17,100
that this user that was using the

94
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:19,740
library or product or whatever did

95
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:22,110
encounter that bug like that bug exists

96
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:24,660
right even if we can't reproduce it that

97
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:27,180
bug still exists and the reason this

98
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:30,240
typically happens is because the context

99
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,890
of the user like the technical context

100
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:33,209
of the user is different than the

101
00:03:33,209 --> 00:03:35,190
technical context of you you know we

102
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:37,709
typically tend to develop on really you

103
00:03:37,709 --> 00:03:40,470
know new fast MacBook Pros or something

104
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:42,120
similar to that like we have powerful

105
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,730
machines that are new we also typically

106
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:48,150
have very fast internet access and a lot

107
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:49,380
of times users don't necessarily have

108
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:50,190
that you know they might have a

109
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:52,920
ten-year-old Dell running yo Windows 7

110
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:56,160
that is like heavily locked down and

111
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:58,260
perhaps they have really poor internet

112
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:00,000
speeds or very intermittent internet you

113
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,440
know there's these differences in

114
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:04,560
context this technical context that

115
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,510
caused the user to encounter the bug and

116
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:07,980
we didn't you know it could have been

117
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:11,220
say a race condition in our code but

118
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:13,050
this race condition was only exposed

119
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:14,640
whenever the performance was slow enough

120
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,700
for the network was slow enough and so

121
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:19,680
it was like the bug absolutely exists in

122
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,419
the code regardless of whether or not we

123
00:04:21,419 --> 00:04:23,100
encountered it and the difference is

124
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:26,400
that context and that's basically what

125
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,750
privileges in a

126
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:29,670
in a nutshell it's the case where we

127
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:31,860
exist in a context in the broader world

128
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:34,470
you know we live in the country we lived

129
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:36,420
and we had the parents that we had with

130
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:38,340
their financial situation you know we

131
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:40,520
are the gender we are they are the

132
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,960
ethnicity we are we are the sexual

133
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,340
orientation we are and so on and so

134
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:46,590
forth so like we all exist within these

135
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:49,170
contexts and there's a lot of bugs in

136
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:51,750
society you know bugs that trace back

137
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:54,240
thousands and thousands of years and so

138
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,820
depending on the context that we live in

139
00:04:56,820 --> 00:05:00,030
we may or may not encounter these bugs

140
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:02,040
in society and that's what privilege is

141
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,630
is when we exist in a context that

142
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:05,340
allows us to sidestep this bug

143
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:07,710
oftentimes without us even realizing

144
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:09,930
that we have done that and one thing I

145
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:12,000
would note is there is nothing you know

146
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,860
there's not a value judgment that I'm

147
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:16,020
placing on the person here just like you

148
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:17,040
know we don't judge the value of a

149
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,960
person based on whether their employer

150
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,660
issued them a new MacBook Pro or an old

151
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:23,250
dell laptop like that doesn't say

152
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:25,590
anything about the person but that is

153
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:27,150
the context and that is how they view

154
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:31,770
the world at the same time so speaking

155
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:33,330
of contacts a lot of times like as

156
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:35,130
engineers we don't know what the users

157
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:36,930
context is at least not fully you know

158
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:39,210
the user files this bug you know we

159
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:40,650
hopefully will figure out you know what

160
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:42,330
browser they're running on you know for

161
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:43,500
really lucky we'll figure out which

162
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,090
browser version in which operating

163
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:47,010
system and we oftentimes don't know the

164
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:49,080
rest we don't know what their ISP is we

165
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,310
especially don't know what their

166
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:51,990
networking conditions were at the time

167
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:53,850
of that bug and sometimes there's even

168
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:56,340
things that could contribute to the bug

169
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:57,990
that we don't even know are things that

170
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:00,360
could contribute to a bug a really good

171
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,860
example actually ran into one last week

172
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:03,360
when I was doing some technical work I

173
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,280
was working with Asher file storage

174
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,930
which is a way of storing files in the

175
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:09,030
cloud pretty straightforward I was

176
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:10,229
following the documentation and I'm

177
00:06:10,229 --> 00:06:11,760
trying to connect to the service to

178
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:14,340
upload some files and I just couldn't

179
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:16,169
connect I was trying everything reading

180
00:06:16,169 --> 00:06:18,270
the documentation following the steps in

181
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:20,040
the azure documentation and what

182
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,840
should've work just was not working for

183
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:22,190
me

184
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:24,360
turns out it was actually a problem with

185
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,850
my ISP they were blocking port 445

186
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:29,340
outbound and I didn't even realize that

187
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:31,260
like I didn't even think to think about

188
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:32,729
that problem and I spent about a day on

189
00:06:32,729 --> 00:06:34,050
it until I realized what was going on

190
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:36,510
and so a lot of times you know it's not

191
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:38,370
that we just that we don't know the

192
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:40,650
users context but we don't know the

193
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:41,460
things

194
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:43,169
that we don't know that are contributing

195
00:06:43,169 --> 00:06:46,319
to the bug so that's basically what this

196
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:49,319
concept of unconscious biases so in

197
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:51,210
society there's a lot of times a lot of

198
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:53,250
things that affect certain groups of

199
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:56,520
people that we don't even think or we

200
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,199
aren't even aware of that is an actual

201
00:06:58,199 --> 00:06:59,789
problem

202
00:06:59,789 --> 00:07:02,190
I think perhaps a good example of this

203
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:03,930
is if we there have been some studies

204
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:05,970
that have shown in meetings you know men

205
00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:07,889
tend to talk a lot more than women do

206
00:07:07,889 --> 00:07:10,770
and sort of the intuitive reaction that

207
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:12,090
a lot of us men will have is that Oh

208
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:14,310
women should just speak up more but

209
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:15,509
there's a whole bunch of other things

210
00:07:15,509 --> 00:07:16,830
that actually play into it a lot of

211
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:18,539
societal dynamics that make that a lot

212
00:07:18,539 --> 00:07:20,400
more complicated and the things that you

213
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,289
know we as men are just not aware of you

214
00:07:22,289 --> 00:07:23,910
know we're unconscious to this and

215
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:25,889
because we're not aware of them we end

216
00:07:25,889 --> 00:07:27,599
up having these biases that come into

217
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:30,360
play now like I said this is unconscious

218
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,310
if we're not doing this on purpose at

219
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:37,139
all but it is still there so another

220
00:07:37,139 --> 00:07:38,789
thing that we tend to see a lot is that

221
00:07:38,789 --> 00:07:41,280
a lot of small bugs can add up to really

222
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,139
big frustrations you know I think we've

223
00:07:43,139 --> 00:07:44,490
all used these services you know we

224
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:46,080
start we log in for the first time we

225
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,970
might encounter a small bug along the

226
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:49,949
way say we log in it goes through a

227
00:07:49,949 --> 00:07:52,500
redirect flow from off and that redirect

228
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:53,880
just like stalls in the middle for some

229
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,740
reason you know we may not know why but

230
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:58,110
it just it sticks and so you know we

231
00:07:58,110 --> 00:07:59,729
have to go up manually hit that refresh

232
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:01,710
button and then it loads and goes along

233
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:04,259
its merry way that's a bug it's not a

234
00:08:04,259 --> 00:08:06,030
very big one it's a small detail you

235
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:07,110
know it didn't get in the way of us

236
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:09,449
using our product well that's just kind

237
00:08:09,449 --> 00:08:11,280
of annoying but then we logged it then

238
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,509
once we're in we start encountering a

239
00:08:12,509 --> 00:08:14,639
lot more of these little things you know

240
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:16,620
maybe there's a label that's just kind

241
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:18,419
of cutting off screen a little bit or

242
00:08:18,419 --> 00:08:19,889
maybe there's a button that you had to

243
00:08:19,889 --> 00:08:21,539
click on twice before it'll actually

244
00:08:21,539 --> 00:08:23,430
activate you know once again every

245
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:24,930
single one of these bugs is a low

246
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:27,500
priority bug but when added up together

247
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:30,659
they add up to a really big frustrating

248
00:08:30,659 --> 00:08:32,310
application you know we tend to say that

249
00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:33,539
these kind of applications like oh that

250
00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:35,669
is so buggy I hate this app you know

251
00:08:35,669 --> 00:08:38,099
it's not we don't approach this as like

252
00:08:38,099 --> 00:08:39,779
oh yeah there's a bunch of little things

253
00:08:39,779 --> 00:08:41,250
but overall the app is great no that's

254
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:44,880
not how our brains actually work you

255
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,589
know that each of those bugs sort of

256
00:08:46,589 --> 00:08:48,329
they they're not even just like a linear

257
00:08:48,329 --> 00:08:50,040
additive thing they kind of multiply

258
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:50,940
against each other

259
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:53,339
and it becomes a really serious issue

260
00:08:53,339 --> 00:08:54,710
and you know we end up lose

261
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:57,440
users and things like that so that's

262
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,760
basically what the concept of

263
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:01,010
microaggressions is so what

264
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:03,200
microaggression is something where

265
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,150
someone will do something to an

266
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:07,400
underprivileged person that just kind of

267
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,110
adds up to a little bit I think a

268
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:11,120
classic example of this is whenever we

269
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,070
use the word guys to refer to all

270
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:16,640
developers like viewed in a vacuum this

271
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,640
is not that big of a deal yeah you know

272
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,810
there's definitely much worse things

273
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:23,000
that a lot of people have to face you

274
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,860
know such as like wage disparity and

275
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:26,990
discrimination things like that so in

276
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:28,340
the grand scheme of things saying guys

277
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:30,050
isn't that big of a deal when viewed in

278
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:30,530
a vacuum

279
00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:33,170
but the thing is it doesn't exist in a

280
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:33,620
vacuum

281
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:36,470
it exists in this broader context you

282
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:38,060
know it is one of those you know little

283
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:40,520
bugs that adds up to a really bad

284
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,080
application you know it's death by a

285
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,330
thousand paper cuts and so you know I

286
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:45,320
think it's really important that we

287
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,750
remember that you know these little

288
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:49,640
things do matter even if they don't seem

289
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:51,500
like a big deal because in aggregate

290
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:54,620
it's just a further reminder that you

291
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:56,330
know underprivileged people are in fact

292
00:09:56,330 --> 00:10:01,010
underprivileged so another thing that we

293
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:03,830
tend to see a lot especially you know if

294
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:05,180
you've done a lot of open source work

295
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:07,070
you'll see this is that users rarely

296
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:08,960
report bugs it was something I'm

297
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,820
actually guilty of myself I was even

298
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:12,460
chatting with Anna last night about this

299
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:15,050
you know we encounter a bug we get kind

300
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:16,520
of frustrated by it but we just move

301
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:19,400
along you know we could take the time

302
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,320
out of our day to open an issue on

303
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,600
github or file an issue with the support

304
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,060
team but we usually don't and because

305
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:27,770
our time is valuable and so we're always

306
00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:29,480
doing these little judgment calls in our

307
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:32,990
head of should I invest my time to see

308
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:35,090
that someone else fixes the problem by

309
00:10:35,090 --> 00:10:37,250
reporting this issue or bug and the

310
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:39,470
answer is almost always now sometimes

311
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:41,450
it's yes but it's almost always no so

312
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:43,670
when we look at what is being reported

313
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:45,500
you know we have to remember that this

314
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:47,300
is sort of a represent a small

315
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:49,700
representation of much bigger problems

316
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:52,160
that you know this is a fraction of the

317
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:56,090
actual bugs users encounter and we see

318
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:57,710
the same thing when we're talking about

319
00:10:57,710 --> 00:11:01,160
culture issues as well and so is the way

320
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,590
I tend to say it is like when we see an

321
00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:05,300
underprivileged person who is calling

322
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:08,240
out bad behavior this is never

323
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,550
the first offense it's the first Hill

324
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:13,880
worth dying on so well when I say that

325
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:17,149
I'm basically saying that someone goes

326
00:11:17,149 --> 00:11:18,680
public writes a blog post let's say

327
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:20,630
condemning a company for certain bad

328
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:22,700
behavior there's oftentimes this

329
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:25,040
instinctual reaction that you know

330
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,390
people working on the company tend to

331
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:29,360
have and that's to dismiss it we say

332
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,890
like okay well that person had a problem

333
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:32,750
but well it's because of yada yada

334
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:34,700
whatever reasons that come up and most

335
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:36,260
important let's say and no one else

336
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:38,600
complained you know we say like well

337
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,640
okay so you know this career person was

338
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:43,970
complaining about homophobia and company

339
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:45,500
but yo there's all these other creepy

340
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:46,820
people and they didn't say anything

341
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:48,770
therefore it should be fine but that's

342
00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:51,560
not how it actually works what was going

343
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:52,910
on with those individuals with those

344
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:55,430
other queer folks is that you know we

345
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:57,260
were doing that analysis in our head and

346
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:59,510
being like is it worth it to call this

347
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:02,060
out is it worth the lost time in

348
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:04,520
productivity perhaps even you know loss

349
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,500
of respect loss of job even in some

350
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,510
cases that go along with it and a lot of

351
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:10,640
times the answer is actually no like you

352
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:12,440
know I certainly see stuff on a pretty

353
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:16,490
regular basis that you know it makes me

354
00:12:16,490 --> 00:12:17,839
uncomfortable it makes me feel isolated

355
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:20,300
and singled out as a queer person in a

356
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:22,910
mostly straight world but I ignore it I

357
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:25,160
don't call it out I just kind of go on

358
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:27,380
my way because you know I'll analyze the

359
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:29,980
situation and realize it's not worth it

360
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:31,970
and so it's important to realize that

361
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:33,380
when we see someone who is calling

362
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:35,630
something out it's not just that this is

363
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:37,490
a thing that happened it's that a thing

364
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:39,529
that happened that was bad enough that

365
00:12:39,529 --> 00:12:41,180
it crossed this threshold where it

366
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:43,790
became worth it to call it out so

367
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:44,990
there's a numbers game there's an

368
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:48,860
aggregate game going on here so that's

369
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:50,480
kind of a couple of the core concepts

370
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,579
that go into you like why we have a lot

371
00:12:52,579 --> 00:12:54,649
of the disparities that we have in tech

372
00:12:54,649 --> 00:12:58,100
and in societies and as a whole but what

373
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:00,860
do we do about it there's a lot of

374
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:02,480
different things we can do and so I'm

375
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,890
gonna focus on a very specific aspect

376
00:13:03,890 --> 00:13:05,329
and this is what we can do as

377
00:13:05,329 --> 00:13:07,970
individuals there's entire conversations

378
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:10,160
we had about what large organizations

379
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,810
and companies can do but that's a

380
00:13:11,810 --> 00:13:14,149
different talk and the big thing we can

381
00:13:14,149 --> 00:13:18,050
do is to develop empathy and so empathy

382
00:13:18,050 --> 00:13:20,660
is a word that gets thrown around a lot

383
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:22,070
and it can mean a lot of

384
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:23,510
different things depending on context

385
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:26,900
but in short empathy is whenever we can

386
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:29,420
emotionally relate to another person you

387
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:31,490
know we are technically it is we are

388
00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:33,340
feeling what another person is feeling

389
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:36,040
and it's having that shared experience

390
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:38,420
now in practice you know no one will

391
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:40,580
ever feel exactly what another person is

392
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:41,660
feeling but you know we'd get a rough

393
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:44,420
idea it's about you know kind of bonding

394
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:46,040
together and creating a shared

395
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:48,050
experience even though we are different

396
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:49,970
we exist in different contexts within

397
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:53,870
the world and so a way that I like to

398
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:56,030
think about it is that we have you know

399
00:13:56,030 --> 00:13:58,370
the privileges that we have and every

400
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:01,070
single person has some privilege in some

401
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:03,170
form or fashion every single person in

402
00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:05,690
this room does have privilege and once

403
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:07,130
again like I said earlier this is not a

404
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:09,320
value judgment on you as an individual

405
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:11,480
like having privilege in and of itself

406
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:13,520
is not a bad thing it's just a state of

407
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:16,070
being what matters is what we do with

408
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:18,680
that and how we act on that that's what

409
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:20,900
really matters

410
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:23,030
but so everyone has privilege and it

411
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:25,370
forms this way that we view the world it

412
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:27,830
colors every interaction we have in

413
00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:29,840
everything we see and so I like to think

414
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,460
of it it's like a lens it's like looking

415
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:33,530
through a pair of binoculars you know we

416
00:14:33,530 --> 00:14:36,110
can see one little thing really really

417
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:38,600
well but we can't see everything that

418
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,700
exists beside it you know we're missing

419
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:43,580
most of the world but we have a lot of

420
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:45,890
insight into this one small part that we

421
00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:49,340
can see and everyone's lens is different

422
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:50,690
just like everyone's privilege is

423
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:52,460
different so the way everyone sees the

424
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:53,510
world is different we are seeing

425
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:56,720
different things and there actually can

426
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,050
be I think a lot of power in that

427
00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:01,310
because if we can really develop our

428
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:03,560
empathy then we this is how we create

429
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:05,510
this lens to someone else like the lens

430
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:07,490
we have is to the lens we have there's

431
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:09,320
nothing we can really do to change that

432
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:12,020
innately but we can talk to someone else

433
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:13,670
who has a different lens we can form a

434
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:15,050
relationship with them we can create a

435
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:17,330
bond with them so that we can together

436
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:20,150
hopefully create a fuller picture of

437
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:21,650
what's going on we can start to see the

438
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:26,330
world in 360 degrees and so the thing

439
00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:28,220
about empathy some people do think all

440
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:30,050
right it's often expressed at least that

441
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:32,150
empathy is just a natural trait we have

442
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:34,910
either you have it or you don't there

443
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:35,930
can be some true

444
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:37,700
to that but empathy is also a skill that

445
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:40,430
can be nurtured it's a skill that can be

446
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:42,380
developed and grown and I think I'm

447
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:43,990
actually a pretty good example of this

448
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:46,190
in the past when I was a lot younger I

449
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:48,110
really was did not have very much

450
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:49,460
empathy and I wasn't very good at

451
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:51,230
expressing that but it's something I've

452
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:52,790
been working at you know pretty hard

453
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:54,770
over the last I don't 10 years or so

454
00:15:54,770 --> 00:15:57,200
maybe 7 years something like that and

455
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,690
I'm by no means perfect of course but

456
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:00,920
you know I have certainly made a lot of

457
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:02,330
progress and I think this is something

458
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:05,300
we all can do and there's a lot of

459
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:07,010
different ways that we can really work

460
00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:10,820
on training our empathy as well way too

461
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:12,290
much to go over into a talk here but I'm

462
00:16:12,290 --> 00:16:14,779
gonna give three specific tips you know

463
00:16:14,779 --> 00:16:15,890
like if there's anything that you can

464
00:16:15,890 --> 00:16:17,959
remember about how to kind of work on

465
00:16:17,959 --> 00:16:21,440
your empathy it's these three things the

466
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,060
first thing is to listen to you and

467
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:24,890
believe marginalize people whenever they

468
00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:27,410
say that there's an issue you know like

469
00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:28,820
I said we all have a different lens we

470
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:30,709
and we exist in these different context

471
00:16:30,709 --> 00:16:33,110
so whenever someone else is saying that

472
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:35,120
you know there's a problem you know at

473
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,170
our company we have a culture problem

474
00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:37,910
this company on our team and it's

475
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:40,910
project our first reaction shouldn't be

476
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:43,430
to say like oh that's not a problem I'm

477
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:44,630
not experiencing that I mean

478
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:46,220
unfortunately this is what we often do

479
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:48,320
though this is how our brains work this

480
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,760
is how human beings are just kind of

481
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,980
wired we always Center ourselves and

482
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:54,320
everything we do because we are the only

483
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,150
person where we have a complete

484
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:57,910
understanding of our own experiences so

485
00:16:57,910 --> 00:17:01,220
our first reaction typically is to say

486
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:03,260
well I don't have that problem therefore

487
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:06,110
it's not a problem but that's not how it

488
00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:07,339
works because we exist in these

489
00:17:07,339 --> 00:17:09,079
different contexts and sometimes we

490
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:10,400
encounter these societal bugs and

491
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,300
sometimes we don't

492
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:14,209
based on that context so what we should

493
00:17:14,209 --> 00:17:16,699
do instead is to start by recognizing

494
00:17:16,699 --> 00:17:19,069
that this person exists in a different

495
00:17:19,069 --> 00:17:21,470
context I may not be experiencing that

496
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:24,679
issue myself but they are and so that

497
00:17:24,679 --> 00:17:26,510
issue does exist you know just like

498
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:28,400
whenever a user reports a bug our first

499
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,679
reaction should be to believe the user

500
00:17:30,679 --> 00:17:32,990
that the bug exists you know and then we

501
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:34,309
could do some investigation and figure

502
00:17:34,309 --> 00:17:37,190
out how together we can actually try to

503
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:38,410
make things better

504
00:17:38,410 --> 00:17:40,940
so yeah just try to really work on that

505
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:43,850
innate reaction to say oh that's not a

506
00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:45,260
problem because I'm not experiencing it

507
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:47,720
and replace that instead with oh that's

508
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,070
interesting and it's like oh I see

509
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:49,850
you're experiencing

510
00:17:49,850 --> 00:17:51,559
this or you're telling me that tell me

511
00:17:51,559 --> 00:17:53,240
more about that because I don't

512
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,380
experience that and I don't quite

513
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:56,990
understand what's going on so listen and

514
00:17:56,990 --> 00:18:01,669
believe first the next bit of advice I

515
00:18:01,669 --> 00:18:03,500
have is to put your ego aside because

516
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,390
really it's not about you as an

517
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:07,850
individual you know these bugs that we

518
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:09,799
have in society have existed for

519
00:18:09,799 --> 00:18:12,230
thousands of years you know there is

520
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:14,120
basically the whole of human history

521
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:16,130
that has led to a lot of the societal

522
00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:18,260
issues that we have now like this is not

523
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:20,750
about the individual this really is

524
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:24,530
about systemic issues you know systemic

525
00:18:24,530 --> 00:18:27,370
issues means it's a bug in the system so

526
00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:29,929
you know whenever you know a person of

527
00:18:29,929 --> 00:18:31,880
color is calling out white people for

528
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:35,600
racism as an example you know this isn't

529
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,760
like we are criticizing you know John

530
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,830
Smith specifically this is saying like

531
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:41,539
there are these - semuc issues that

532
00:18:41,539 --> 00:18:44,780
pervade all of society that's some when

533
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:48,260
we hear that you know try to not feel

534
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:49,820
personally attacked because it's not a

535
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:52,580
personal attack you know unless you're

536
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:54,320
someone who is say on the shitty medium

537
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,520
in list or something like that in that

538
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,620
case okay maybe it is about you but

539
00:18:57,620 --> 00:18:59,210
assuming you're not an asshole like that

540
00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:00,860
which I hope none of you are then

541
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:03,169
realize that this is much bigger than

542
00:19:03,169 --> 00:19:06,710
any individual so try not to get

543
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:08,630
defensive it once again it's human

544
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:10,250
nature to get defensive when someone is

545
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:12,320
criticizing us but you know just like

546
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,610
whenever we're working on a pull request

547
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:16,159
like a really good skill as an engineer

548
00:19:16,159 --> 00:19:18,200
when we get critical feedback in a pull

549
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,850
request is not to get angry at the

550
00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:21,980
person who gave us that feedback but

551
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:24,380
instead to go fix our code you know and

552
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:26,659
update our pull request exact same thing

553
00:19:26,659 --> 00:19:29,000
here really is we're getting feedback

554
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,530
and then we want to work on this

555
00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:35,870
together to improve things and finally

556
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:38,360
the last tip I have is to actively work

557
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:41,809
to create inclusive teams so the thing

558
00:19:41,809 --> 00:19:43,159
about creating like inclusive and

559
00:19:43,159 --> 00:19:45,350
diverse teams is that they don't happen

560
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:47,480
on their own they take work like it

561
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:49,429
takes work to get different types of

562
00:19:49,429 --> 00:19:51,230
people together you know we have network

563
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:52,940
effects you know we tend to typically

564
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:56,299
know people who are mostly like us so if

565
00:19:56,299 --> 00:19:57,850
we want to bring in people to our team

566
00:19:57,850 --> 00:20:00,350
that are not like us you know we have to

567
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:03,470
work a little harder at it and it's

568
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:04,640
just about getting people there it's

569
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:07,309
also making sure that people stay as

570
00:20:07,309 --> 00:20:09,799
well and so you know not only do we have

571
00:20:09,799 --> 00:20:11,299
to reach out to more people to build

572
00:20:11,299 --> 00:20:13,280
these better teams we have to work on

573
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,690
our culture you know just like creating

574
00:20:14,690 --> 00:20:16,880
a really good culture around a pool

575
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,620
request takes working and we have to get

576
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:20,960
over that defensiveness and instead you

577
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,010
know work towards you know more of a

578
00:20:22,010 --> 00:20:23,360
common good we have to do that when

579
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,330
we're creating inclusive teams as well

580
00:20:25,330 --> 00:20:28,010
and that's also another topic where that

581
00:20:28,010 --> 00:20:29,750
would take me a couple of talks to

582
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:32,030
really go through but just you know I'll

583
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:33,350
say it takes work there's a lot of

584
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:34,610
resources out there as well where you

585
00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:37,429
can figure out how to do that and we

586
00:20:37,429 --> 00:20:39,080
really want to do this because we are so

587
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:41,500
much stronger together than we are apart

588
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,880
there's been a lot of studies that have

589
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,650
come out that have shown that when you

590
00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:47,990
control for other variables more diverse

591
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:50,390
teams will always outperform less

592
00:20:50,390 --> 00:20:52,340
diverse teams like there's a very very

593
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:54,620
strong correlation there and so you know

594
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:56,059
when we talk about building inclusive

595
00:20:56,059 --> 00:20:57,740
and diverse teams you know we're not

596
00:20:57,740 --> 00:20:59,659
just doing this for the sake of a metric

597
00:20:59,659 --> 00:21:01,700
or the sake of some statistics we want

598
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:03,049
to do this because it makes things

599
00:21:03,049 --> 00:21:06,260
better genuinely better and you know

600
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:07,940
when we kind of think about on this it

601
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:09,320
actually makes a lot of sense

602
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:10,340
you know especially when we take this

603
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:13,010
lens view of the world you know we're

604
00:21:13,010 --> 00:21:15,049
trying to solve problems and a lot of

605
00:21:15,049 --> 00:21:16,400
the problems that we're trying to solve

606
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,409
with our products and our province or

607
00:21:18,409 --> 00:21:22,610
projects are hard problems and in order

608
00:21:22,610 --> 00:21:24,620
to fix a problem in order to solve a

609
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:26,150
problem we first have to understand it

610
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:28,760
and so we gain a better understanding of

611
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:31,460
any given problem if we can get people

612
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:32,990
who view those problems in different

613
00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:34,429
ways you know they have these different

614
00:21:34,429 --> 00:21:36,470
lenses in different ways of looking at

615
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:38,750
things so we get more diverse teams in

616
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:41,419
place we solve problems faster and we

617
00:21:41,419 --> 00:21:43,159
solve them more completely because we

618
00:21:43,159 --> 00:21:45,799
have a better understanding and I'm not

619
00:21:45,799 --> 00:21:47,270
saying this is easy you know it's not

620
00:21:47,270 --> 00:21:48,530
just you get a more diverse team than

621
00:21:48,530 --> 00:21:50,390
its unicorns and rainbows it is hard

622
00:21:50,390 --> 00:21:52,580
because we get these more diverse teams

623
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:54,200
that means our ideas are going to be

624
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:57,289
challenged more not less but that's a

625
00:21:57,289 --> 00:21:57,830
good thing

626
00:21:57,830 --> 00:22:00,590
I mean having our ideas be challenged is

627
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:02,690
not easy it's tough you know once again

628
00:22:02,690 --> 00:22:04,820
we get defensive and reactive we don't

629
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:07,490
like people saying that we're wrong but

630
00:22:07,490 --> 00:22:09,020
that's actually kind of the point though

631
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:10,850
is that you know when people are saying

632
00:22:10,850 --> 00:22:12,289
well I don't think this is right you

633
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:13,429
know and we're saying the same thing

634
00:22:13,429 --> 00:22:16,039
back we're all challenging each other we

635
00:22:16,039 --> 00:22:17,420
get rid of the bad idea

636
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:18,920
as quickly and we'd get to those good

637
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:21,530
ideas a lot faster we create better

638
00:22:21,530 --> 00:22:23,000
products we create more well-rounded

639
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,400
products and things like that but this

640
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,200
is also even more than just a business

641
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,750
case you know when we create these more

642
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:30,770
diverse teams you know we're bringing

643
00:22:30,770 --> 00:22:32,780
more people to the table we're uplifting

644
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:35,000
all of society and not just a single

645
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,640
segment in it I think there's all these

646
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:39,220
kinds of network effects that we get

647
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:41,330
whenever we're just bringing more people

648
00:22:41,330 --> 00:22:43,700
into the fold and you know as we've seen

649
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:46,370
there's oftentimes a lack of talent in

650
00:22:46,370 --> 00:22:48,200
engineering you know it's hard to find

651
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,810
people to fill roles we need more people

652
00:22:50,810 --> 00:22:53,030
and if we can start reaching out to more

653
00:22:53,030 --> 00:22:54,560
people to fill those roles that need to

654
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:56,870
be filled not only are we getting the

655
00:22:56,870 --> 00:22:58,640
people we need we're able to build

656
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:02,240
better products and at the same time and

657
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,950
we're just we're helping out a lot of

658
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:05,570
these individuals too we're addressing a

659
00:23:05,570 --> 00:23:07,400
lot of these systemic issues that we

660
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:10,070
have Asus's in society so hopefully we

661
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:12,230
can get to a point someday where we

662
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:13,940
actually are working on fixing these

663
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:18,200
bugs and society and there's a lot of

664
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,880
ways to do that like I said before if

665
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,440
you want to learn more Mozilla has an

666
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,150
inclusion lounge that's going on there's

667
00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:24,710
a panel discussion going on right after

668
00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:27,320
this in fact and I'm gonna be there and

669
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:28,640
with that I want to thank you all for

670
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:32,760
listening
