00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:09,630

hello my name is the Ginga and I'm

2
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:12,300
either and I want to tell you today oh

3
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:13,830
but first I want to tell you about the

4
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:17,570
law that we have in Norway actually and

5
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:20,369
inaccessible websites are illegal in

6
00:00:20,369 --> 00:00:23,070
Norway this is a law that has been in

7
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:30,119
effect this is a lot of in effect since

8
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:33,960
July 2014 it had unanimous support in

9
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:37,020
our Parliament it was backed by NGOs and

10
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:38,730
also the industry in Norway so the hold

11
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:40,290
industry and everyone is really

12
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:41,610
basically agreed this is a good idea

13
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:42,629
let's do it

14
00:00:42,629 --> 00:00:44,640
and then what's interesting also is

15
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,160
often laws like these are just applied

16
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:49,260
to the public sector but Norway it also

17
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:52,260
applies to the private sector so if

18
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:55,379
you're a bank if you're airline you also

19
00:00:55,379 --> 00:00:57,809
have to follow the law and how its

20
00:00:57,809 --> 00:01:00,780
defined is that anything that is can be

21
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:03,329
considered a main channel to offer

22
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:05,250
services or information to the general

23
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:07,680
public has to be accessible that's

24
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,479
pretty broad and thing also so when we'd

25
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:14,460
say accessibility in this context is

26
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:17,400
based on the world the web content

27
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:20,759
accessibility guidelines - oh and not

28
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:22,860
all of the double-a criteria but most of

29
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:24,299
them so all the ones that are in green

30
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:27,659
are under the law we have like a bunch

31
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:29,340
of links and resources so that were a

32
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:30,600
link that we share afterwards and then

33
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:31,829
you can get all of the details if you

34
00:01:31,829 --> 00:01:34,020
want to know and there's the thing is

35
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:36,000
there's a bunch of countries that also

36
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,220
have these laws but in Norway they can

37
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:40,470
also have consequences so there's a

38
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:43,290
state agency called Die fight they make

39
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:45,780
random controls and check the websites

40
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:48,119
according to the criteria and published

41
00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:50,880
a report online as this this is the

42
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,159
things that this company has to fix and

43
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:56,549
his old public and online and I think

44
00:01:56,549 --> 00:01:59,219
it's a year or two years ago v CAG was

45
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:02,009
actually making headlines in Norway

46
00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:04,890
these are headlines from two of Norway's

47
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:07,320
largest newspapers on the headline SAS

48
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:09,179
as a Norwegian airline and the headline

49
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:13,950
says SAS fails SS as risking fines

50
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:15,599
interesting thing is like it was in all

51
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:16,860
of the newspapers it was making

52
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:19,140
headlines on the story was not only that

53
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:20,970
it made them look well you know

54
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:22,440
following the law but it also made them

55
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,630
look incompetent you don't understand

56
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:26,430
technology because was such a broad

57
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:28,140
support from the industry and also from

58
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:29,340
the Parliament it just made them look

59
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:29,940
stupid

60
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:33,810
so accessibility is something it's not

61
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:35,910
really something just a question about

62
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:37,980
morals anymore in Norway because

63
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:38,970
something you should I think it's

64
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:40,170
something you should do anyway but it's

65
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:43,380
also you're risking bad press finds

66
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:48,360
stuff like that so back to us this is

67
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,610
our company and this time this is our

68
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:53,660
entire company will fit into a selfie

69
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:56,220
and we're based out of Norway that's

70
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:57,720
what we have to care about this law this

71
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,519
is a Norwegian fjords for you if in case

72
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:00,959
you were doubting where we were from

73
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:04,739
Norway and so as its mentioned what

74
00:03:04,739 --> 00:03:06,720
we're trying to do is I just to give you

75
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,890
a little bit of context what we're

76
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:10,470
trying to do is to make a super easy

77
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:14,280
video calling so the thing is and is

78
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,440
that it's in the browser so you can just

79
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,870
like send someone a link and they can

80
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:20,970
open it on any device and then you're in

81
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:23,340
the call oh I have to be careful with a

82
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:26,459
clicker here yeah in the call so the

83
00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:27,720
thing is and there's a couple of people

84
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:30,780
that do this but why colours comes into

85
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:32,790
this is that the people that use our

86
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:34,920
service our businesses or professionals

87
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:37,170
so could for instance be your physician

88
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:39,410
there's offering video appointments

89
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:42,870
maybe you have a cold like I have today

90
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:44,970
actually and maybe you want to talk you

91
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:45,989
a therapist even though you're

92
00:03:45,989 --> 00:03:48,540
travelling or maybe sometimes you would

93
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:49,709
want to learn something from a

94
00:03:49,709 --> 00:03:51,180
professional and the person was best

95
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:52,980
suited to teach you this it's on the

96
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:54,750
other side of the world like if I want

97
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:56,100
to learn Japanese it's probably better

98
00:03:56,100 --> 00:04:00,090
to get a teacher that's in Japan and the

99
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:02,790
thing also these people they have the

100
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:03,959
brands you know they already have

101
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:05,549
businesses so if they're going to offer

102
00:04:05,549 --> 00:04:07,590
the services they would like to brown

103
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:10,920
their video calls so just to give you a

104
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:13,350
little bit more like an image of who our

105
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:16,440
client could be this is Siri she's

106
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,829
amazing Siri funk-rock she's a midwife

107
00:04:18,829 --> 00:04:22,109
she's been running giving advice to

108
00:04:22,109 --> 00:04:24,479
people about pregnancy and newborns for

109
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:26,990
like on the instant almost 20 years now

110
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:29,630
this is a Google it's called everything

111
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:32,000
from mom doctor I know this is a Google

112
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,470
Translate so this is what she does she

113
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:35,300
knows she's the mid-foot she knows

114
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:37,580
everything about giving advice as a

115
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:40,310
midwife she doesn't she's not a designer

116
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:44,180
she's not a developer so maybe cuz she

117
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:45,740
lets people ask questions about

118
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:47,300
pregnancy online maybe that's a good

119
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:48,470
format for video too

120
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:52,280
okay so it's the case so okay how does

121
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:54,199
this what does this have to do with

122
00:04:54,199 --> 00:04:56,300
accessibility so let's look wheel it all

123
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:59,900
up the thing is if you let people brand

124
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,070
something the first thing you would

125
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:04,599
think of is Cola but if we let people

126
00:05:04,599 --> 00:05:06,560
pick any Cola

127
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,410
what about the contrasts in a bunch of

128
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:11,750
services I'm not here to bash just to

129
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:14,419
give some well-known examples if you for

130
00:05:14,419 --> 00:05:16,430
instance avoid shoes our gel yellow for

131
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:18,680
my profile at Twitter that the contrast

132
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,150
is not good enough or if I choose yellow

133
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:21,800
for our intercom messenger the contrast

134
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:22,970
really isn't good enough I have to pick

135
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:25,669
another color to make sure that the

136
00:05:25,669 --> 00:05:29,539
contrast is sufficient and then then I

137
00:05:29,539 --> 00:05:31,370
and I have to know that that's specialty

138
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:33,080
knowledge you know what contrast is not

139
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:37,280
everybody knows that so here we are CEO

140
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:40,070
I was like well I won't post I wanted to

141
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:42,650
pee can we just let people just pick any

142
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:45,949
color and then we just make sure that is

143
00:05:45,949 --> 00:05:49,009
accessible so the questionnaire for my

144
00:05:49,009 --> 00:05:51,560
CEO and then us in will our senior

145
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,630
engineer Ivan isn't a designer and

146
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:55,610
looking and I was also here because I

147
00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:58,250
took the photo yeah so that's was the

148
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:00,580
thing that were we trying to figure out

149
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:02,690
okay but to get everyone on the same

150
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:05,530
page I think a lot of us know that

151
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:08,509
intuitively colors have contrast towards

152
00:06:08,509 --> 00:06:12,409
each other but what does actually the V

153
00:06:12,409 --> 00:06:14,750
CAG requirements say for contrast color

154
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:17,330
so it says that the visual presentation

155
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:19,580
of text and images of text has to have a

156
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:21,469
contrast ratio of at least four point

157
00:06:21,469 --> 00:06:24,349
five to one and for large text the same

158
00:06:24,349 --> 00:06:26,990
requirement is three to one one of the

159
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:28,880
new things now is that in 2.1

160
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,919
specification that just came out also

161
00:06:30,919 --> 00:06:32,780
non-text elements like interface

162
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:35,240
elements buttons and the likes and icons

163
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,279
also have to have sufficient contrast

164
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:38,730
ratio

165
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:42,810
but yeah so what exactly is contrast so

166
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:44,490
it turns out that contrast has a

167
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:46,320
definition but together that it's

168
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,940
important to understand one thing first

169
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:50,160
and that is that according to V CAG

170
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,410
every single color has what's called

171
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:54,750
their relative luminance or a lightness

172
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:58,110
ratio basically telling you how light a

173
00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:01,620
color is from 0 which is pitch black to

174
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:05,070
1 which is bright white and get the

175
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:07,140
contrast between two colors you do it

176
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:09,750
like this so you take the luminance of

177
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:13,260
the lighter color plus a constant 0.05

178
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:15,660
that's just to avoid any division by

179
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:18,330
zero issues and stuff like that and then

180
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:20,520
I divide that by the luminance of the

181
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:23,640
darker color like here and that gives

182
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:28,230
you the color contrast ratio to give you

183
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:30,480
a proper example let's look at this

184
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,310
button right here it's the yellow button

185
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:35,370
with black text on it so together the

186
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:37,320
contrast ratio between the text color

187
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:39,000
and the background here we take the

188
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,820
luminance of the yellow and divide that

189
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:44,070
by the luminance of the black and we

190
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:49,260
arrive at 12.4 as we know that is larger

191
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:50,910
than 4.5 which means that this has

192
00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:52,470
sufficient contrast according to

193
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:55,370
requirement and according to the law

194
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:57,420
actually researching this and

195
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:58,860
understanding what where that number

196
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:01,020
came from was just so cuz we always put

197
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:02,790
it into some calculator no yeah that's

198
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:04,230
the right number ones like but where

199
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:07,230
does it come from now we know and so the

200
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:08,640
thing is this there's nothing really

201
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,990
wrong with this yellow button this is

202
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:12,450
our default it's just and then maybe

203
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:14,340
someone comes along that's like a doctor

204
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:16,560
or something doctors like blue and there

205
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,470
Brian color is dark blue and now it's

206
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:21,480
suddenly kind of hard to read the button

207
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,100
but if you're a designer and you've met

208
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:25,380
so this is a quite easy solution to this

209
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:27,210
from a design perspective let's just

210
00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:29,910
flip the call of the text of the button

211
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:32,220
to white and said and then the contrast

212
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:34,560
is sufficient and then we were trying to

213
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:37,800
thinking about well what about grey does

214
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,180
would it will will it work for

215
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:40,349
everything but actually if you think

216
00:08:40,349 --> 00:08:43,410
about the math that we just went to when

217
00:08:43,410 --> 00:08:46,140
the criteria is 4.5 if you have either

218
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:49,110
black text or white text it will

219
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:52,500
actually validate against any color Eve

220
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,450
any color your shade of gray will either

221
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:57,390
violate against white or a black so

222
00:08:57,390 --> 00:08:59,670
there you have the solution maybe you

223
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:04,050
can just fix that for me sure okay so

224
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:05,760
you and I we sat down and we started

225
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,310
going about this problem and we started

226
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:10,200
thinking this is way before we knew

227
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,030
anything about color contrast or how

228
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:14,850
that was defined I started thinking what

229
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:16,530
if we could do math on colors wouldn't

230
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:17,400
that be kind of cool

231
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:20,610
I mean intuitively colors in computing

232
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:22,590
are bits or numbers you should be able

233
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:26,040
to do calculations on numbers right and

234
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,480
it turns out we're not the first one to

235
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:30,540
think of this there's an NPM package for

236
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:32,580
that actually because of course there's

237
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:36,060
an NPM package for that so the NPM

238
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:38,040
package color lets you do a lot of cool

239
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:41,700
stuff with colors it can manipulate or

240
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:44,730
convert colors it can rotate them it can

241
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:46,620
mix them with other colors you can check

242
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:49,140
your lightness ratio you can also test

243
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:53,040
their VK color contrast and more but

244
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,210
there's one problem here all of this is

245
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:55,830
in JavaScript and we don't really want

246
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:57,839
to do all these calculations for every

247
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:00,830
single component on our entire page

248
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:03,540
ideally we'd want to do this once and

249
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:06,450
then apply that or store that in some

250
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:08,370
kind of variable that we can use in our

251
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:10,880
sauce sheets and as Mike just told you

252
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:14,100
we can do that now so just in case you

253
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:16,530
are out for that talk I'm gonna go run

254
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:18,300
through it for like one minute and just

255
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:20,850
tell you the basics again so CSS custom

256
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:22,500
properties allows you to define

257
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:26,730
variables in CSS basically you know that

258
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:28,290
means you can reuse color definitions

259
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:30,420
and more that can be complex values

260
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:33,480
throughout your stylesheet and they are

261
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,480
cascading and they can be overwritten

262
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:38,339
the syntax looks like this used a double

263
00:10:38,339 --> 00:10:39,990
dash notation to define our custom

264
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:42,570
property and you assign it a value then

265
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:44,070
you can use that using the VAR keyword

266
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:48,750
like so you can also manipulate these

267
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:51,089
from JavaScript using the set property

268
00:10:51,089 --> 00:10:54,240
function the first argument is the name

269
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,880
of the custom property and of second one

270
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,850
is the value this also works for inline

271
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:01,770
styles if you're using JSX that is one

272
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:04,230
approach you can use as well I think

273
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:05,540
that's pretty nice

274
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:08,970
but back to our problem so to solve this

275
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:11,040
first things first we should import the

276
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:15,210
color library then we create an instance

277
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:18,390
of the of color with our brand color or

278
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:20,310
whatever brown color

279
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:23,640
the customer wanted it can either be

280
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,560
hard-coded like here or do like us we

281
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,630
load it from the back end and apply it

282
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:29,700
asynchronously at runtime for our entire

283
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:33,210
application then we can simply check if

284
00:11:33,210 --> 00:11:35,550
the primary color is white and if it is

285
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:37,950
the contrast color is designed to black

286
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:41,779
and if it isn't is assigned to white

287
00:11:41,779 --> 00:11:44,640
then we simply set that using the set

288
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:48,300
property tag back to your CSS and in

289
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:50,310
your button component you set the

290
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:52,980
background color with war and a text

291
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:55,310
color to the contrast color like so and

292
00:11:55,310 --> 00:11:59,100
automatically updates now there's a

293
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:01,589
bunch of different best use cases here

294
00:12:01,589 --> 00:12:05,400
and Mike talked a lot about those but be

295
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,170
diligent and use custom variables

296
00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:08,160
throughout if you're going for this

297
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,200
approach for theming otherwise you get

298
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,870
into issues later and such sensible

299
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:14,700
defaults to avoid any flash of and water

300
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:16,980
content what's neat about this is that

301
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:18,060
when we change this at runtime

302
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:19,950
everything updates at the same time

303
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:24,209
which is very good so that was a bunch

304
00:12:24,209 --> 00:12:25,800
of buttons and that was the talking

305
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:29,670
thanks for coming or wait a second the

306
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:31,740
thing is what we have guaranteed now is

307
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:34,230
that you will always be able to read the

308
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:37,380
text on the button but what if someone

309
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:40,250
comes along and they have a really light

310
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:45,540
Frank color where did that button go so

311
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:47,130
even you can still read the text your

312
00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:48,600
mail might not even understand that it

313
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,459
is a button at all so the thing that we

314
00:12:50,459 --> 00:12:52,500
figure then is well what we would

315
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,779
typically do and maybe what if we could

316
00:12:54,779 --> 00:12:56,430
have like a darker version of the same

317
00:12:56,430 --> 00:12:59,130
color and add an outline so that we will

318
00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:00,570
be sure that people will still see the

319
00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:02,310
button even if the brown color is really

320
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:06,209
light you want to fix that too right so

321
00:13:06,209 --> 00:13:08,580
this problem is a bit more complex right

322
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:11,010
because there's actually two problems

323
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:12,810
here first we need to generate a

324
00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:15,270
secondary color now a darker primary

325
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:17,339
color which is as close to a primary

326
00:13:17,339 --> 00:13:18,790
color as possible

327
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:20,170
but still validates against our

328
00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:21,490
background color which in this case is

329
00:13:21,490 --> 00:13:24,250
white and the second problem is that we

330
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:26,380
want to add a conditional border that

331
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:28,690
only gets applied if the primary color

332
00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:31,240
is lighter than the current minimum

333
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:34,630
constant ratio how do you do that well

334
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:37,540
remember colors yes again so I told you

335
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:39,550
that it allows you to mix colors and

336
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:42,580
test contrast oh I was supposed to click

337
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:47,380
here yeah so but intuitively if you want

338
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:50,110
to make a darker color in real life this

339
00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:51,850
is the first problem if you have a

340
00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:53,650
palette with a color that you want to

341
00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:55,210
make darker you take a little bit of

342
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:57,670
black and mix that in until you get the

343
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,380
desired color there are sort of the

344
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:01,350
thing for that

345
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:04,390
okay so let's try to make a function

346
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:06,310
that can do this for us is that a

347
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:08,200
function get validate the color takes a

348
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,390
couple of arguments it takes the color

349
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:13,210
that we want to change in this case our

350
00:14:13,210 --> 00:14:15,100
primary color it takes the color that we

351
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:16,780
want to validate against it defaults to

352
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:19,240
white there's the minimum contrast ratio

353
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:21,490
that we want to achieve and it takes a

354
00:14:21,490 --> 00:14:25,180
mixing amount mmm this is 0.5 it's quite

355
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:26,740
important that this is cool it's a bit

356
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:29,020
low because imagine the same palette

357
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:30,520
that you had earlier and you take a

358
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:32,530
bucket of black paint and pour it all

359
00:14:32,530 --> 00:14:34,240
over the end result is going to be black

360
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,610
and you made a mess right so that's not

361
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:37,810
gonna work you have to do it in small

362
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:42,610
baby steps to get a proper color and

363
00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:44,020
then of course last you take the mixing

364
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:47,380
color so let's look at the body of this

365
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:50,020
function so first things let's generate

366
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:53,020
a new color using the mix function so if

367
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:55,270
the color to want to change mix and we

368
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:56,650
mixed up with the mixing color and the

369
00:14:56,650 --> 00:15:00,730
mixing amount then we check if the new

370
00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:03,640
colors contrast towards white is less

371
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:05,830
than a minute constant ratio and if it

372
00:15:05,830 --> 00:15:09,070
is we call the function again this time

373
00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:10,780
with a new color as the color we want to

374
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:13,090
change and a smaller mixing amounts we

375
00:15:13,090 --> 00:15:16,960
just do it very very close until

376
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:19,890
eventually we get a color that validates

377
00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:21,860
against white

378
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:24,110
someone engineers serum I think well

379
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:25,310
haven't you made a function that could

380
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:27,380
potentially run forever and the thing is

381
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:30,320
that black will always validate against

382
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,000
white lease for the minimum conscious

383
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,410
ratio there is no chance that this

384
00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:34,880
actually running forever you always end

385
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,370
up with a color that does validate

386
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:42,380
against white and once we have that we

387
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:43,790
can simply call the function with a

388
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:45,620
primary color and get the primary color

389
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:48,350
darker primary color back and we set

390
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:55,010
that back into our CSS so onto our next

391
00:15:55,010 --> 00:15:56,510
problem adding a conditional button

392
00:15:56,510 --> 00:16:00,140
border how would you does well in the

393
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:03,440
normal case there is no border at all so

394
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,360
let's tackle that problem first so we

395
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:08,480
create a custom variable custom property

396
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,530
that has the button border which has the

397
00:16:11,530 --> 00:16:14,930
default value of none and then we assign

398
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:16,430
that to the border property of our

399
00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:19,100
button and now presto we have a button

400
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:23,780
with no border but in our CSS we can say

401
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:26,210
if the primary colors contrast against

402
00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:27,980
white is less than minimum constant

403
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:31,790
ratio update that property and set it to

404
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:34,160
2 pixels solid and our second or are

405
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,950
darker primary color and that means that

406
00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:39,560
now we have a conditional border that

407
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:41,600
will only show up if the color that the

408
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,400
customer set is less than the minimum

409
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:48,440
contact ratio so just to sum it up a

410
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,790
little bit so for instance if we have

411
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:52,490
the Year color yellow we will generate

412
00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:54,230
lighter and darker versions of that

413
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:55,600
because we also you suffer other

414
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,920
interface moments like hovering and

415
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,870
stuff like that if we have a darker

416
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:02,300
color we would change the text to white

417
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:03,830
and then also have the lighter in the

418
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:05,839
darker if the color is really light we

419
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:07,640
add a border and also have these lighter

420
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:10,010
and darker ones but then you know so

421
00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:11,449
they're doing the math in the back here

422
00:17:11,449 --> 00:17:12,589
and mean the design you're working

423
00:17:12,589 --> 00:17:13,970
together and you would also think well

424
00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:15,830
aren't you done now what more is there

425
00:17:15,830 --> 00:17:17,480
like how many colors you really need on

426
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:19,070
the website and this time I was like

427
00:17:19,070 --> 00:17:22,910
well what about secondary colors and you

428
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:25,310
should never base any functionality on a

429
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:26,750
color alone because of colorblindness

430
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:28,760
but for people that do see the whole

431
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,620
spectrum it can actually be kind of

432
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:31,940
confusing if everyone thing is like

433
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:33,620
really strong in the same yellow it's

434
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:35,180
gonna be overwhelming

435
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:38,000
and and he's like if we have a brand you

436
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,430
typically have more colors and I'm I

437
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:41,870
really rolled in the companies to work

438
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:43,730
with user friendliness and usability in

439
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:46,700
UX and they're like oh my god I'm trying

440
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:48,320
to imagine how I'm gonna explain to you

441
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,540
sir yeah pick one color and we're gonna

442
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:52,370
use this for that and pick another color

443
00:17:52,370 --> 00:17:54,080
maybe is gonna use this for that and

444
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,400
like it was like this is never gonna

445
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,290
wouldn't work just we have to make it so

446
00:17:57,290 --> 00:17:59,330
simple if we just ask them for one color

447
00:17:59,330 --> 00:18:01,520
and every we just fix the other one so

448
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,020
again we're looking well we've figured

449
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:05,000
these other things out how can we go

450
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,190
about can we try to generate the

451
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:10,490
secondary colors somehow and so just to

452
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:12,500
give you an example this is like our

453
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,360
default colors so what we would want

454
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:17,810
we're using the secondary colors here

455
00:18:17,810 --> 00:18:19,820
for instance if there's a notification

456
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:21,500
or like a warning or something like that

457
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:24,410
so ideally we want to color the face

458
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:25,850
with the original brown color that

459
00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:28,130
doesn't crash too much but it also seems

460
00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:31,910
like a different color and when you

461
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:33,680
think about it like looks nice together

462
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:36,170
it's kind of different where's the

463
00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:39,530
where's the math in that the other ones

464
00:18:39,530 --> 00:18:41,210
required clear was like is that is there

465
00:18:41,210 --> 00:18:43,310
a number for that looks nice together if

466
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:46,400
it's kinda different and so I just we

467
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,810
were discussing trying to like bullet

468
00:18:47,810 --> 00:18:49,460
has to be a pattern here so we discussed

469
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:50,810
this with our design you like so when

470
00:18:50,810 --> 00:18:53,360
you make brands you know from the ground

471
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,190
up how do you go about choosing the

472
00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:57,380
secondary colors and you started talking

473
00:18:57,380 --> 00:19:00,500
about color wheels and there's like a

474
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,420
bunch of different people for hundreds

475
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:03,500
of years people have thought about

476
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:06,950
colors and concept of color wheels it's

477
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:08,300
not really important what color wheel

478
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:09,290
we're talking about they're just the

479
00:19:09,290 --> 00:19:11,570
concept of color wheels and the thing

480
00:19:11,570 --> 00:19:13,790
isn't how all of these are represented

481
00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:16,730
if you go on the top here and then you

482
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:18,650
try to move what he said it's like well

483
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:20,270
I try to just move slightly down the

484
00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:22,580
circle until we find something that

485
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:26,270
looks like a new color but it still goes

486
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:28,970
good together you know so you don't go

487
00:19:28,970 --> 00:19:30,710
all the way around the circle could then

488
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:33,800
is gonna look quite horrible and then

489
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,390
I'm gonna introduce you to on your color

490
00:19:35,390 --> 00:19:37,310
wheel these are quite old but then here

491
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:40,370
we have the HSL color wheel so HSL color

492
00:19:40,370 --> 00:19:44,300
is built up by tree values you have Q

493
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:46,910
which is a degree from 0 to 360 degrees

494
00:19:46,910 --> 00:19:48,600
so that's important for us and RL

495
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:52,770
saturation and then we have lightness so

496
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:54,570
actually this color wheel expresses

497
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:56,370
exactly what our designer was talking

498
00:19:56,370 --> 00:19:59,130
about because what if we could just

499
00:19:59,130 --> 00:20:01,500
rotate to hue so for instance if we

500
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:04,170
repair the brown color is red we would

501
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:06,750
rotate it and we're like and some I

502
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:08,640
discussed this with like a developer

503
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,900
like how did you come up with this

504
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:12,840
number of sixty degrees just like no we

505
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,730
just went with sixty degrees that's just

506
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:16,590
like a gut feeling thing so like there's

507
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:18,090
no math behind sixty that's just

508
00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:20,670
intuition that's just competence of our

509
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:22,500
designer six degrees we looked around

510
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:24,140
the circle like yeah that's gonna work

511
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:27,060
and you know mid there was the math

512
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:31,260
there after all yeah so going into this

513
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:32,760
we thought well this is gonna be super

514
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:35,430
hard to do but turns out it really isn't

515
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:38,160
because you just use only color jazz you

516
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:40,890
can use to rotate property and get

517
00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:42,600
another color and what it does

518
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:46,110
essentially is just add the hue degrees

519
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:49,440
in CSS and actually funny thing is we've

520
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,790
been fretting about this talk for maybe

521
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:53,310
two months now and try to go over and

522
00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:55,140
find stuff we could improve never meet

523
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:59,130
Mike earlier and then we've been talking

524
00:20:59,130 --> 00:21:00,570
about but he shows me this demo I've

525
00:21:00,570 --> 00:21:02,220
actually can do all of this in CSS and

526
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:04,770
I'm like damn it I wish I'd done that

527
00:21:04,770 --> 00:21:08,790
I've told her that before yeah so with

528
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:11,010
this you get a secondary color you can

529
00:21:11,010 --> 00:21:13,410
set that back into our CSS and we can

530
00:21:13,410 --> 00:21:14,790
also use the same functions to generate

531
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:16,620
darker or lighter variants of that as

532
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:20,340
well okay so now we have a bunch of

533
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:23,220
rules how can you actually bring that

534
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:25,620
back in together into a team engine so

535
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:27,450
what we did is they created a rack

536
00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:30,360
component that we call theme and what

537
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,580
this component does is that it takes a

538
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:34,260
property brown color which we load

539
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:36,750
asynchronously and it uses that to

540
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:38,880
calculate all other colors according to

541
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:43,290
our rule sets and when working this like

542
00:21:43,290 --> 00:21:46,350
this it's important to remember that you

543
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:48,000
never hard-coded values anywhere here

544
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,150
CSS you always use CSS custom properties

545
00:21:50,150 --> 00:21:53,190
because what you get out of it is a

546
00:21:53,190 --> 00:21:55,140
single style sheet that is infinitely

547
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:57,480
brandable we can apply to any color and

548
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:00,120
it gives you a decent result back

549
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:02,309
and it also means that you can do a lot

550
00:22:02,309 --> 00:22:04,159
of cool performance things for example

551
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:06,240
you don't have to do server-side

552
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,970
rendering to generate a new CSS for

553
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:10,770
every single customer you can just store

554
00:22:10,770 --> 00:22:13,890
one value and then apply it at runtime

555
00:22:13,890 --> 00:22:16,380
this means you can cache at CSS forever

556
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:19,529
for example you can also do critical

557
00:22:19,529 --> 00:22:22,140
path rendering and stuff like that and

558
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:23,190
you don't have to do that for every

559
00:22:23,190 --> 00:22:27,330
single organization you might serve and

560
00:22:27,330 --> 00:22:28,620
using the thing component looks like

561
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:29,039
this

562
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:31,289
so theme applies all these custom

563
00:22:31,289 --> 00:22:33,779
properties to its own element and thanks

564
00:22:33,779 --> 00:22:36,570
to CSS when we wrap our entire Apple

565
00:22:36,570 --> 00:22:39,899
component in it every rule will or every

566
00:22:39,899 --> 00:22:41,820
color will apply to every component ins

567
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:44,159
and outs and this is also infinitely

568
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:46,140
nests table so for example we want to

569
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:48,899
give a rich preview the updates in real

570
00:22:48,899 --> 00:22:50,549
time for the customer to see how their

571
00:22:50,549 --> 00:22:54,210
color looks in real time we can do that

572
00:22:54,210 --> 00:22:57,720
we just wrap the preview in a new theme

573
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,580
component and it doesn't affect anything

574
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:02,600
else on the page which is really neat

575
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:05,669
yeah yeah so the thing is now we could

576
00:23:05,669 --> 00:23:08,039
like to confidently say to see yeah just

577
00:23:08,039 --> 00:23:10,380
pick any color you like it's not her job

578
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:12,270
to think about the accessibility law

579
00:23:12,270 --> 00:23:14,730
that's our job and what I think is

580
00:23:14,730 --> 00:23:16,799
really fun here is that when we put in

581
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:21,059
her brand color which is pink look can

582
00:23:21,059 --> 00:23:23,610
you see this automatically generated

583
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:25,649
secondary color there in the progress

584
00:23:25,649 --> 00:23:29,309
bar and then look at her logo so the

585
00:23:29,309 --> 00:23:31,289
algorithm actually went for a secondary

586
00:23:31,289 --> 00:23:33,240
color that's basically the same that was

587
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:35,039
already in her logo so it's like it's

588
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:37,380
something's nice to have a designer and

589
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:38,520
your team they just give you the

590
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:40,110
algorithm that's how you make your

591
00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:42,929
brands oh maybe not that easy but anyway

592
00:23:42,929 --> 00:23:46,770
so this is a with the simple thing now

593
00:23:46,770 --> 00:23:49,020
like if people pick different colors it

594
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:51,840
still has like really this clear picture

595
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,460
of their brand it looks very differently

596
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:55,169
depending on the color that you pick but

597
00:23:55,169 --> 00:23:57,299
it's still the same elements and really

598
00:23:57,299 --> 00:24:01,230
like brings the brand forward so of

599
00:24:01,230 --> 00:24:03,179
course there's gonna be a demo so now if

600
00:24:03,179 --> 00:24:06,360
you can pray to the demo god I promised

601
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:08,130
myself I would never do a live demo on

602
00:24:08,130 --> 00:24:10,520
stage and I'm gonna do it anyway and

603
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:13,340
gonna work I promise yeah so here we

604
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:15,920
build a tester that lets you test out

605
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:17,600
all these colors using the color picker

606
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,790
for input and you can see in real time

607
00:24:19,790 --> 00:24:22,430
here that now we have applied the border

608
00:24:22,430 --> 00:24:25,360
property live and if ever example go

609
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:28,820
here you have some darker colors and it

610
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:30,200
works you can see all the code if you

611
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:32,000
scroll down you see the buttons - yeah

612
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,050
ok so here are some test things so even

613
00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:37,790
if I pick bright white that actually

614
00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:40,130
works and you can rotate this around and

615
00:24:40,130 --> 00:24:42,260
it's really fast and snappy thanks - we

616
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:44,360
only do this once we started into CSS

617
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:46,010
and it automatically updates everywhere

618
00:24:46,010 --> 00:24:47,930
and we can try looking at with

619
00:24:47,930 --> 00:24:51,580
colorblindness - yeah so we have a

620
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:53,240
what's it called again

621
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:56,630
oh yeah but if I click there we go oh

622
00:24:56,630 --> 00:25:00,230
yes let's try for example red week yeah

623
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:02,800
that works good how about monochromatic

624
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:08,360
yeah that looks good yeah so this also

625
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:11,200
works for different kinds of

626
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:15,440
colorblindness and so there's a link

627
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,090
where you can test this we'd be really

628
00:25:17,090 --> 00:25:19,130
fun if like if someone manages to break

629
00:25:19,130 --> 00:25:22,250
it or like find the color where the like

630
00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:23,900
automatic thing just makes like a

631
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:26,480
there's a horrible job that would be fun

632
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,300
and just tweet us with it and like

633
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:32,510
there's a hole but it looks it doesn't

634
00:25:32,510 --> 00:25:33,860
look that good with red I don't know

635
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:35,300
what's wrong with red than yellow

636
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:37,900
something the algorithm fails there yeah

637
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:40,970
definitely not done yeah so the thing is

638
00:25:40,970 --> 00:25:42,560
so we're gonna leave this link up a

639
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:44,180
little bit hmm

640
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:45,410
so we've been talking here about

641
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:47,870
accessibility and accessibility law and

642
00:25:47,870 --> 00:25:50,480
and of course important for me to just

643
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,970
underline it this means in the way that

644
00:25:52,970 --> 00:25:54,500
I believe that our team is done with

645
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:56,470
accessibility and I don't think

646
00:25:56,470 --> 00:25:58,160
accessibility is a thing that you can

647
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:00,950
never think of us done it's it's but it

648
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:02,330
does goes for everything that we do

649
00:26:02,330 --> 00:26:04,100
online if it's performance or usability

650
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:05,540
and accessibility just has to be

651
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:06,890
intertwined with the work that you do

652
00:26:06,890 --> 00:26:09,740
and something you do continuously but I

653
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:12,590
think that I want to come bring to you

654
00:26:12,590 --> 00:26:15,710
is through this process it became really

655
00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:18,410
clear to us that Jesus all right yeah

656
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:21,320
sorry he just pressed the keyboard what

657
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:23,280
I thought I saw the many on time

658
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:25,710
is that it's the team effort yes yes you

659
00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:28,040
can see here a great time effort and

660
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:30,030
thanks so much better when you work

661
00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:31,470
together someone gonna click the keys

662
00:26:31,470 --> 00:26:35,220
for you but the thing is we we are and

663
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:36,960
we were an interdisciplinary team and I

664
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,220
don't think we would ever have come up

665
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:39,780
with the solution if we would have been

666
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:41,040
working on it on our own that's a

667
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:43,260
combination that made this possible and

668
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:46,800
I also want to I really love this law I

669
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:48,990
think it's wonderful I don't see it as

670
00:26:48,990 --> 00:26:51,540
like a constraint or something oh no we

671
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:52,860
have to make it accessible it's not a

672
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:55,850
deterrent to us at all and I think that

673
00:26:55,850 --> 00:26:58,740
for developers and or designers I think

674
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:02,040
would almost always really love with our

675
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:04,620
jobs it's this challenge it's like when

676
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:06,600
you get these puzzles like how am I

677
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:08,340
gonna solve this and suddenly you find

678
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:10,500
the aha moments and that's such a

679
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:13,350
satisfying feeling and accessibility can

680
00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:15,720
give you a bunch of those and in that

681
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:17,700
perspective you know this is one of the

682
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:20,420
most fun things that I've done and and

683
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:23,610
and it's a good thing for someone let

684
00:27:23,610 --> 00:27:25,290
that's like a bonus it's fun and you're

685
00:27:25,290 --> 00:27:27,150
making the product accessible for more

686
00:27:27,150 --> 00:27:30,120
people as I mentioned here like a demo

687
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:34,430
resource and yeah thank you thank you

688
00:27:34,430 --> 00:27:34,480
[Applause]

689
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,070
[Music]

690
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:37,560
[Applause]
