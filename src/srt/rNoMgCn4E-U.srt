00:00:08,110 --> 00:00:13,519

hi thank you for the intro as she said

2
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:15,530
my name is Antoine Butler and I'm a

3
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:17,750
front-end developer for an advertising

4
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:22,310
agency outside of DC called HD DG we

5
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:26,710
build you know websites and apps for

6
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:28,310
organizations like National Football

7
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:33,109
League Volkswagen and so on and I'm

8
00:00:33,109 --> 00:00:34,519
really excited to be here because I'm on

9
00:00:34,519 --> 00:00:36,890
a team of 14 developers who are

10
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:40,489
primarily full-stack they do really

11
00:00:40,489 --> 00:00:44,480
crazy javascript stuff node and Python

12
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:45,949
development and I'm one of the few

13
00:00:45,949 --> 00:00:48,379
dedicated front-end developers which

14
00:00:48,379 --> 00:00:50,809
makes something like CSS comp really

15
00:00:50,809 --> 00:00:53,569
awesome so I'd like to say thank you to

16
00:00:53,569 --> 00:00:58,639
everyone for having me and not doing a B

17
00:00:58,639 --> 00:01:02,960
track right now instead so thank you so

18
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,119
on to while I'm actually here my talk

19
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:07,399
embraced the vertical the future of hi

20
00:01:07,399 --> 00:01:11,869
Pia queries when I went around to my

21
00:01:11,869 --> 00:01:14,810
team I kind of asked them if you were

22
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:15,710
here what do you want to know about

23
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:19,479
vertical media queries and how to use my

24
00:01:19,479 --> 00:01:23,930
things slipping here and pretty much the

25
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:28,130
consensus was what are vertical media

26
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:30,710
queries and I thought you know what

27
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:32,990
that's a really good question so maybe

28
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:34,969
I'll backtrack and make sure we're all

29
00:01:34,969 --> 00:01:36,950
on the same page as far as what about

30
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:40,810
media query is so apologize if this is a

31
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:44,390
very entry-level introduction to the

32
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:47,659
subject matter so again what is a

33
00:01:47,659 --> 00:01:49,640
vertical media query I'm going to

34
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,259
paraphrase the spec because it's

35
00:01:51,259 --> 00:01:55,369
entirely too wordy which reads a media

36
00:01:55,369 --> 00:01:56,929
query allows you to tailor your layout

37
00:01:56,929 --> 00:01:58,869
based on any number of conditions

38
00:01:58,869 --> 00:02:02,270
against a media type and those available

39
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:04,969
conditions are of course aspect ratio

40
00:02:04,969 --> 00:02:08,659
orientation resolution color and size

41
00:02:08,659 --> 00:02:11,599
and while I'm here is to talk to you

42
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:13,590
guys about size

43
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:15,480
because it's not just the whiff that

44
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:20,370
counts I had to that gift that gives me

45
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:22,890
a moment to breathe so a part of me if I

46
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:25,200
sound ridiculously nervous or if I don't

47
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,230
in the Amy because this is also my first

48
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:36,090
talk ever yeah and luckily I think we're

49
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:38,430
kind of running a little over so I might

50
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:39,599
be able to make this short you can get

51
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:42,510
everyone to lunch long time but I wanted

52
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:47,220
to quote Chris koya from a article I

53
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:49,790
think two years ago where he said

54
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:52,769
measuring width is a nice practical

55
00:02:52,769 --> 00:02:54,360
example of media queries but it's not

56
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,730
the only thing available but despite

57
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:58,829
that if you go to any CSS gallery your

58
00:02:58,829 --> 00:03:01,579
littered with websites that are

59
00:03:01,579 --> 00:03:04,440
responsive based entirely on its width I

60
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:08,840
mean even media queries media query I es

61
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:12,180
peptides that are responsive almost

62
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:16,650
entirely based on their width so to kind

63
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:21,000
of reiterate what a media query is this

64
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,340
this is what we all typically do what we

65
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:27,569
see on the CSS galleries are we running

66
00:03:27,569 --> 00:03:29,069
a media query and we're testing against

67
00:03:29,069 --> 00:03:32,459
a width size the max with or men with a

68
00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:34,709
vertical media query does the

69
00:03:34,709 --> 00:03:36,750
perpendicular I'm just checking against

70
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,849
the hike hence the name and brace the

71
00:03:38,849 --> 00:03:45,120
vertical so what why does it matter it's

72
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,590
that's a good question because I mean if

73
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:48,780
you look we what we all in this room

74
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:51,720
have done some amazing things using the

75
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:54,919
width as our primary condition but I

76
00:03:54,919 --> 00:03:57,000
don't think that's good enough I think

77
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,109
there's opportunities for us do some

78
00:03:58,109 --> 00:04:01,230
really cool things with our layout based

79
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:05,400
on height so one of the reasons that I

80
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,660
don't think the width is good enough and

81
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:08,790
while height is important is one because

82
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:11,000
content size is variable not intrinsic

83
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,940
and by content I mean words not images

84
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:16,889
because of course if we sell I image to

85
00:04:16,889 --> 00:04:18,450
be one percent with and we make our with

86
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:20,160
more narrow the image gets smaller our

87
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,790
content our words

88
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:26,420
don't scale I we make our with scenario

89
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:29,150
and the content gets solar another

90
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:31,070
reason is that we increase the scrolling

91
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:33,950
which isn't a bad thing because the fold

92
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:37,100
doesn't exist but it is an opportunity

93
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:38,860
for us to improve upon the users

94
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:44,180
scrolling experience another reason is

95
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:45,920
device fragmentation and by device I

96
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:48,080
mean any electronic or mechanical device

97
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,380
that we use to consume web content so

98
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:53,960
not just handheld tablets but also the

99
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,150
laptops and eventual TVs that we will

100
00:04:56,150 --> 00:05:00,710
peruse the internet with and a shameless

101
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:04,810
plug for my wife who is a rabid fan of

102
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:09,020
Wizard of Oz netbooks apples and

103
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:11,630
androids oh my these are the devices

104
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:14,600
that we're talking about not just the

105
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,340
handheld stuff that's in our pocket

106
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:18,590
right now also the laptops that or a

107
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:24,470
desk and yeah so question who here

108
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:26,510
remembers this I think it actually

109
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:29,600
originally was posted around 2010 but

110
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,750
they did a another article in 2013 to

111
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:37,010
discuss device fragmentation when this

112
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:39,170
came out I mean there was blog posts

113
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:41,300
left and right about how responsive web

114
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:43,190
design was destined to fail because it

115
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:45,710
was just too many variables if to me it

116
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:47,300
felt like responses fear-mongering it

117
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:48,550
wasn't like we could just go out and

118
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:53,000
settle the break the breakpoints so I

119
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,040
always hated that grab because it was it

120
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,150
was overwhelming you couldn't you

121
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:59,780
couldn't really grasp what needed to

122
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:02,990
happen what I like better was this

123
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:05,870
graphic from the same article which kind

124
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:07,370
of does a better job of explaining what

125
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:11,600
we do because it shows the list amount

126
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,690
of widths that we all have to deal with

127
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:17,480
doing responsive web your time but even

128
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,850
this only tells half the story which is

129
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:21,590
why this graphic is actually my favorite

130
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:24,830
because it shows that the height is just

131
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:27,200
as variable as the width I throw these

132
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,940
devices move from both directions and it

133
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:30,020
doesn't even account for the fact that

134
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:31,910
we can change the orientation of our

135
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:33,449
advices

136
00:06:33,449 --> 00:06:35,340
which then makes art with our height and

137
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:40,979
our height width well my last reasons

138
00:06:40,979 --> 00:06:43,650
why this is important is because squishy

139
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:46,379
is not good enough unless we're talking

140
00:06:46,379 --> 00:06:48,629
dodgeball because I've watched my kids

141
00:06:48,629 --> 00:06:50,639
play and doesn't matter how soft the

142
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:56,999
ball is so to quote myself and take a

143
00:06:56,999 --> 00:07:02,939
drink of water delicious squishy is a

144
00:07:02,939 --> 00:07:04,860
legacy solution but it is also the

145
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:08,180
foundation of responsive web design

146
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:12,150
basically show of hands who here has

147
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:18,629
ever done this not in an email so this

148
00:07:18,629 --> 00:07:20,580
is old-school I mean I'm glad there was

149
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:21,900
a lot of hands because that means I'm

150
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,550
not the only old one here even though I

151
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:27,240
have less hair than most people this

152
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,159
this is what we all used to do to make

153
00:07:29,159 --> 00:07:31,620
fluid websites this was what we did

154
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:34,279
before responsive web design was a thing

155
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:38,189
this is pre wide UK pre squishy this is

156
00:07:38,189 --> 00:07:41,099
when tables were in and in this the same

157
00:07:41,099 --> 00:07:43,409
premise of just filling your your your

158
00:07:43,409 --> 00:07:45,539
browser's with is all that responsive

159
00:07:45,539 --> 00:07:49,050
web design kind of relies on its core

160
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:52,050
tool and that's why we're here to this

161
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:54,749
side with a sky with his accordion which

162
00:07:54,749 --> 00:07:56,159
is supposed to be a metaphor for how

163
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:59,240
websites like an accordion or squishy

164
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:02,399
horizontally even though you could hold

165
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:04,199
your accordion this way them still work

166
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:05,729
but anyway I wanted to keep in there

167
00:08:05,729 --> 00:08:10,009
because he looks awesome and he's happy

168
00:08:10,009 --> 00:08:12,719
anyway my point is that you can only be

169
00:08:12,719 --> 00:08:16,259
squishy in one direction or reliably in

170
00:08:16,259 --> 00:08:18,050
one direction and that's along the wit

171
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:20,939
so what do we do with that being our

172
00:08:20,939 --> 00:08:24,479
limitation we actually can't be

173
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:28,409
responsive instead we have to adapt or

174
00:08:28,409 --> 00:08:31,319
die trying I'm going to paraphrase

175
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:32,849
actually not perfect we want to

176
00:08:32,849 --> 00:08:35,190
repurpose a quote from Karen McGrane for

177
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:37,560
a list of parts responsive web design I

178
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:40,319
won't fix your content problem where she

179
00:08:40,319 --> 00:08:43,199
said smart organizations will see this

180
00:08:43,199 --> 00:08:45,959
as a benefit not a drawback and we use

181
00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:46,790
this

182
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:49,400
to make a better website not just a

183
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,620
squishy one she wasn't talking about

184
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:54,350
vertical media queries or going back to

185
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:56,420
adaptive design but the sentiment is

186
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:59,930
true here so again I want to go back and

187
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:03,050
then redefine get again what exactly a

188
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:05,150
vertical media query is a vertical media

189
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:08,750
query is not a responsive tool it is

190
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:12,010
actually an adaptive solution to our

191
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:14,000
content design and user experience

192
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,350
problems so now on to the meat and

193
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:20,960
potatoes of my talk why everyone is here

194
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,970
hopefully is to see some potentially

195
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:26,930
cool coat and this would be the fun part

196
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:29,900
this part I haven't practiced so much so

197
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:32,630
here we go so first up I wanted to kind

198
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:36,080
of investigate a an existing site an

199
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,180
existing opportunity for vertical media

200
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:41,930
queries and I wanted to make sure I

201
00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:44,300
picked a website where the developers

202
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:47,450
who involved in it won't hate me so I

203
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:52,100
picked Wikipedia so the use cases

204
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:54,500
long-form reading the solutions that

205
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:58,130
Wikipedia actually do themselves can be

206
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:00,620
used on blogs articles research papers

207
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:03,680
it's not unique to Wikipedia anything

208
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,110
that has a lot of content this approach

209
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:08,540
that they do to their to the layouts we

210
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:11,750
all can adapt in some way for our own

211
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:15,050
purposes so I needed an article to use

212
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:19,250
as my example and since we have a party

213
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:21,260
tonight I figured I'm going to use my

214
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:24,550
drink of choice which was bourbon and

215
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:29,300
yeah finally tonight if I make it

216
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:32,810
through this talk so I search for

217
00:10:32,810 --> 00:10:36,380
bourbon whiskey and the Wikipedia

218
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:39,560
article looks something like that when

219
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:46,610
you scroll it on your desktop yep yeah

220
00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:49,820
ok now we're finished that was fast we

221
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:51,350
didn't read anything so imagine trying

222
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:54,220
to experience that on your mobile device

223
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:56,620
luckily we don't have to because

224
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:59,740
Wikipedia zone Mobile Pay

225
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:02,410
says users of supported mobile devices

226
00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:04,630
automatically redirected to the official

227
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:09,070
mobile version of Wikipedia com which

228
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:12,310
looks like a much more pleasing and

229
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:18,340
consumable that when I when I inspected

230
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:26,500
the V iOS simulator I realized two

231
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:30,190
things one the markup was ridiculously

232
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:33,100
simple and simple enough that it could

233
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:36,460
actually serve desktop but instead they

234
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:37,780
give us two entirely different code

235
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:40,030
bases two entirely different URLs and

236
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:43,950
they redirect so I wanted to compare the

237
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:49,300
mobile versus desktop solution or UI and

238
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:50,620
essentially all they did was they

239
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:53,380
simplify the navigation they use an

240
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:55,120
accordion layout they Center their

241
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,590
images and they change the font to it

242
00:11:56,590 --> 00:12:00,550
more readable serif all those things we

243
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:02,080
can do without our separate URL in a

244
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:04,660
separate code base so what I want to do

245
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:06,130
is build a prototype very bare-bones

246
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:10,020
kind of showcasing a use case for

247
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:11,920
vertical media queries but what I'm

248
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,210
going to do is not worry about the

249
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:16,390
simplified navigation because oh that's

250
00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:19,840
just too much backward for day so here

251
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:22,630
we go so what we have here is very

252
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:25,570
dumbed down version of the Wikipedia

253
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:29,050
mobile HTML which is basically a div

254
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:31,180
with an ID content we've got an h1 for

255
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:34,030
our article title they've put all their

256
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:38,110
images inside of class thumb got an

257
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:41,680
introductory text and h2s Aria roles

258
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:45,250
that match the ID of the sibling div and

259
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:48,910
that's where their content is I don't

260
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:50,950
want to deal with that so I converted to

261
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:52,630
something a little more readable yay for

262
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:56,920
semantics and we with an article keeping

263
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,960
the h1 we're using figures instead of

264
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:03,250
divs we got the introductory text we

265
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:06,220
have an ID on our h2 and we're using

266
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:08,860
sessions for the content separation

267
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:10,370
instead of dips

268
00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:14,570
and if anyone wants to actually follow

269
00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:17,290
along from this point to see the more

270
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:21,560
fleshed out stylized prototype just bit

271
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:28,310
ly / wiki proto you all five seconds to

272
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:31,550
not do that and never going to just go

273
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:33,830
to some base CSS to kind of get us there

274
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:35,900
so first thing I did was again this is

275
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:37,250
kind of roughly based on the actual

276
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:41,720
existing Wikipedia com I just set a font

277
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,779
font weight font size line height

278
00:13:43,779 --> 00:13:46,400
sans-serif font we're going to put a

279
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:49,250
border under our h2s and we're going to

280
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:51,170
flow to our figures to the right and

281
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:54,260
center of the text there's more in the

282
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:57,770
actual code example in that URL that you

283
00:13:57,770 --> 00:14:00,560
can mess around with but basically what

284
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:03,080
we end up getting is a very Wikipedia

285
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:06,350
light layout this is essentially

286
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:08,630
Wikipedia I mean with links and more

287
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:12,760
images and really robust navigation so

288
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:15,320
this works now I'm going to go and throw

289
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:19,100
in some some media queries so the first

290
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:20,570
thing we do is I'm going to go with an

291
00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:22,930
actual traditional with base media query

292
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:26,690
first that will essentially just tell

293
00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:28,610
our figure to be full width and we

294
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:31,100
already have our content centered so if

295
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:33,110
you're on a device that's six hundred

296
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:35,420
fifty pixels small small or a browser

297
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:36,920
that is six hundred and fifty percent

298
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:40,490
power pixels wide it will Center your

299
00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:42,440
figure elements and then we're going to

300
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:45,140
use a vertical media query and all we're

301
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:48,580
really doing is font family serif and

302
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:50,900
hiding all the sections and mind you

303
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:54,050
this display none is exactly what

304
00:14:54,050 --> 00:14:56,029
Wikipedia is doing there's no animations

305
00:14:56,029 --> 00:14:57,410
there's there's no nothing there just

306
00:14:57,410 --> 00:14:59,839
toggling display non-display bak on

307
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:06,730
their div and it turns this into this

308
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:09,140
again if you check out the the URL

309
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:12,830
you'll see it's that I only do anything

310
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:15,470
else there's no redirect there's no

311
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:19,850
nothing so you throw in some some some

312
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:21,410
image loading love

313
00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:28,370
slick nav and maybe actual images you

314
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:30,230
you would potentially render the mobile

315
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:34,699
version of Wikipedia calm unnecessary so

316
00:15:34,699 --> 00:15:36,649
the benefits of an adaptive

317
00:15:36,649 --> 00:15:39,490
wikipedia.com were adaptive anything

318
00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:41,480
really comes down to you don't have to

319
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:42,829
worry about device detection which has

320
00:15:42,829 --> 00:15:45,470
its own woes you work with a single code

321
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:47,750
base and since all of us in here write

322
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:49,819
code for us coach right the better right

323
00:15:49,819 --> 00:15:53,089
and you get improved SEO and share

324
00:15:53,089 --> 00:15:57,980
ability and it's great so Wikipedia calm

325
00:15:57,980 --> 00:16:01,490
that's my first example my next example

326
00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:09,019
is VW calm so much for picking sites

327
00:16:09,019 --> 00:16:11,600
that people will be mad at me but this

328
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,509
is actually a internal project as well

329
00:16:14,509 --> 00:16:17,269
so I think it warrants a little

330
00:16:17,269 --> 00:16:22,879
backstory so VW con was recently

331
00:16:22,879 --> 00:16:25,459
redesigned and this is their their nav

332
00:16:25,459 --> 00:16:27,500
we did not design it we didn't build it

333
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:30,949
or anything like that and this this

334
00:16:30,949 --> 00:16:32,569
fixed nav on the left they absolutely

335
00:16:32,569 --> 00:16:34,430
love they met all the requirements of

336
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:37,910
the of the clients the UX everything

337
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:40,449
work you click more and you got the

338
00:16:40,449 --> 00:16:42,769
navigation of slide out off the screen

339
00:16:42,769 --> 00:16:45,709
this is not a mobile or tablet approach

340
00:16:45,709 --> 00:16:48,980
this is just desktop and they liked it

341
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:51,860
so much that when they came to us for

342
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:53,060
the properties that we are responsible

343
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:55,970
for they wanted to reuse that exact same

344
00:16:55,970 --> 00:16:59,209
nav except it had entirely different

345
00:16:59,209 --> 00:17:02,500
requirements and those requirements just

346
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:05,240
don't work with what was designed and

347
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:08,679
approved so those new requirements were

348
00:17:08,679 --> 00:17:11,480
primary navigation must support up to

349
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:18,260
six items and if we actually go back was

350
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:22,079
too fast ninja

351
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:25,289
there we go so this is actually full

352
00:17:25,289 --> 00:17:29,399
screen on my 15-inch macbook pro I've

353
00:17:29,399 --> 00:17:31,799
got enough room for two more items there

354
00:17:31,799 --> 00:17:34,950
but if a mouth full screen don't have

355
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:37,950
room for two items and if I have my my

356
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:40,679
doc expose might have room for one more

357
00:17:40,679 --> 00:17:42,929
item and if i'm on a 13-inch macbook pro

358
00:17:42,929 --> 00:17:44,870
I don't have any more room for anything

359
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:47,760
so we're talking a desktop experience

360
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:53,070
that needs to be adaptive the second

361
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:55,500
requirement was that the secondary

362
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,149
navigation which is what you will see

363
00:17:57,149 --> 00:17:59,669
when you click on more I needed to be

364
00:17:59,669 --> 00:18:01,110
able to support an unlimited number of

365
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:03,539
items which means you can scroll within

366
00:18:03,539 --> 00:18:05,909
it means the navigation can have 10

367
00:18:05,909 --> 00:18:09,779
items and it can have 100 that's a whole

368
00:18:09,779 --> 00:18:13,320
nother design problem but the third

369
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:14,789
reason and this is actually something

370
00:18:14,789 --> 00:18:16,649
that i added to the requirements because

371
00:18:16,649 --> 00:18:19,470
i used to do front-end development for a

372
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:21,029
government so i like to try to make sure

373
00:18:21,029 --> 00:18:23,490
things are as accessible as possible I

374
00:18:23,490 --> 00:18:24,980
wanted everything to be keyboard

375
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:28,139
accessible didn't want to have to rely

376
00:18:28,139 --> 00:18:31,080
on JavaScript to to build out my UI or

377
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:35,820
to access content so this is what the

378
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:38,610
navigation on their current site looks

379
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:41,159
like when you when it's fully exposed

380
00:18:41,159 --> 00:18:44,669
we've got the four primary navigation

381
00:18:44,669 --> 00:18:46,200
which you'll see on the right and we've

382
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,510
got the list of secondary navigation

383
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:51,690
which is on the left and again if you

384
00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:53,940
want to follow along from this point

385
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:58,019
with my own prototype please go to bit

386
00:18:58,019 --> 00:19:01,620
ly / sticky nav I'm really surprised

387
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:05,880
that wasn't taken already people are

388
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:11,789
lazy so again bare-bones HTML this is

389
00:19:11,789 --> 00:19:15,809
what I started off with nav element on

390
00:19:15,809 --> 00:19:21,690
order list I chosen to keep my li for

391
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:24,389
the logo inside the the list instead of

392
00:19:24,389 --> 00:19:26,309
using a separate header and then all the

393
00:19:26,309 --> 00:19:29,100
additional navigation items are marked

394
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:31,740
up white so we're going to Li link an

395
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:33,360
image for the icon

396
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:37,559
and the link text within a span now we

397
00:19:37,559 --> 00:19:40,380
can handle that image the whole tons of

398
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:43,200
different ways but from my prototype

399
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,700
that's the way I want with it that's the

400
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:48,120
way it is and like said there can be a

401
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:51,270
hundred of those if you want and now for

402
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:54,090
my disclaimer my following slides of

403
00:19:54,090 --> 00:19:57,750
code are using less not sass because I

404
00:19:57,750 --> 00:20:01,020
bet on the dark horse so anyone in here

405
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:05,520
with me oh and some of your lying you're

406
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:09,120
lying lying lying lying alright so first

407
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:12,690
thing I did was kind of easily themify

408
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:15,270
this created a theme variable just so i

409
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:18,090
can save colors and funny to meddle with

410
00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:20,040
them later for hover states and things

411
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:21,900
like that the next thing i did was i set

412
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:23,970
a font size and you'll see that these

413
00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:27,330
ian values go ridiculously long at a

414
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:30,419
point but i'm going to put the pixel

415
00:20:30,419 --> 00:20:31,770
value affairs and comments you know

416
00:20:31,770 --> 00:20:34,500
we're working with but essentially it

417
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,540
comes down to our nav based font sizes

418
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:40,350
11 pixels each individual nav item is 95

419
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:42,960
pixels by 95 that is a design

420
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,179
requirement which also makes the the

421
00:20:45,179 --> 00:20:47,429
button potentially fragile if the the

422
00:20:47,429 --> 00:20:51,900
text get gets too long and then the

423
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:56,130
exception to our primary nav size is

424
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:58,290
that the logo height has to have its own

425
00:20:58,290 --> 00:21:00,419
so I put that in a variable I think we

426
00:21:00,419 --> 00:21:02,580
set the drawer with which is the NAB

427
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:06,630
that sits outside of your view to 21

428
00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:11,970
point 36 36 36 or 235 pixels and the two

429
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:14,040
magic numbers at the bottom which is

430
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:15,240
which are my favorite because this

431
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,380
actually allows this prototype to be

432
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:18,929
really flexible since this NAB has to

433
00:21:18,929 --> 00:21:21,260
exist on multiple sites with multiple

434
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:23,820
requirements one site might say we only

435
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:26,190
want for nav items one site might say we

436
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:28,530
want to have ten so at any point you can

437
00:21:28,530 --> 00:21:30,299
just change that that highlight number

438
00:21:30,299 --> 00:21:33,480
or even the minimum number and enforce a

439
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:38,280
new set of rules on that nav so up next

440
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:42,960
we have the nav based styles this is why

441
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,870
I gave up writing notes on

442
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:47,360
gonna try to run through each a line of

443
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:51,080
CSS quickly but we're going to transform

444
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:54,650
the beam ave I'm going to move it to the

445
00:21:54,650 --> 00:21:57,860
left so that the drawer nav the

446
00:21:57,860 --> 00:21:59,570
secondary nav is out of view when a

447
00:21:59,570 --> 00:22:02,690
position it fix to the top I'm going to

448
00:22:02,690 --> 00:22:05,300
set the width and some typography

449
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:07,640
choices here so it kind of matched what

450
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:12,080
was on VW calm then saw the actual

451
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,970
individual navs the images in the spans

452
00:22:13,970 --> 00:22:16,190
within them so I just go ahead and put

453
00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:18,880
the padding's on there I've got some

454
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:23,620
text treatments another transition and

455
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:27,320
we're going to position our our imaging

456
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:31,460
spans to be in line so this is that

457
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:33,620
secondary nav with the the text is not a

458
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:36,860
perfect square it's actually kind of a

459
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:42,110
stack stack nav single line and the CSS

460
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:44,990
for the UL itself we set our width we

461
00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:47,600
wanted to scroll that way it can grow

462
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,429
forever can just scroll within that side

463
00:22:49,429 --> 00:22:55,309
pane and I chose to use CSS content to

464
00:22:55,309 --> 00:22:57,710
actually style the separator between the

465
00:22:57,710 --> 00:23:00,530
secondary nav in the primary and all

466
00:23:00,530 --> 00:23:03,559
that pretty much just gives us this this

467
00:23:03,559 --> 00:23:07,670
is our default navigation that appears

468
00:23:07,670 --> 00:23:10,580
off-screen so that is our native state

469
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:12,890
with no other work done that is all we

470
00:23:12,890 --> 00:23:15,559
end up well with and now for we're a

471
00:23:15,559 --> 00:23:20,210
little adjustment to our variables for

472
00:23:20,210 --> 00:23:23,120
minimum number and highlight number in

473
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:27,110
this incidence since I kept the logo in

474
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:29,690
the nav when we're counting how many nad

475
00:23:29,690 --> 00:23:31,460
the limits we want to have have to add

476
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:33,800
one to account for the logo that's just

477
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:35,630
deeper into the CSS no one should be

478
00:23:35,630 --> 00:23:37,130
meddling with that it's kind of like

479
00:23:37,130 --> 00:23:39,679
part of the framework in a way so next

480
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:42,260
we had to create a outfits on that good

481
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:45,020
yeah I had to create a mixin that

482
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:47,570
basically was stylized this native nav

483
00:23:47,570 --> 00:23:49,610
to look like a primary square and a

484
00:23:49,610 --> 00:23:52,670
vital and I did so by using display

485
00:23:52,670 --> 00:23:55,510
table which is our new old friend

486
00:23:55,510 --> 00:23:58,120
we position it absolute and we're going

487
00:23:58,120 --> 00:23:59,590
to position it off to the right notice

488
00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:02,830
I'm not setting its top position because

489
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:04,990
we're going to automate that later and

490
00:24:04,990 --> 00:24:08,380
then I tell the individual links to

491
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:11,140
display table cell vertical align them

492
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:14,020
in the middle and then just set the

493
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:16,690
padding and size on them and now I'm

494
00:24:16,690 --> 00:24:18,040
telling my image to be displayed block

495
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:22,690
so everything looks like that when it

496
00:24:22,690 --> 00:24:25,090
gets it's the highlight mixer and apply

497
00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:27,160
to it so now we actually have to worry

498
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:29,290
about how to position everything since

499
00:24:29,290 --> 00:24:30,640
we're taking a whole bunch of stack

500
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,310
navigation items on the left and

501
00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:35,680
positioning absolute on the right and we

502
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,240
want to do that in a way that's not

503
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:42,670
fragile so I wrote a two mix-ins that

504
00:24:42,670 --> 00:24:44,740
will basically do all work for me one is

505
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:48,450
called position nav yay for readability

506
00:24:48,450 --> 00:24:51,490
that essentially just counts the number

507
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:55,980
of items that we want to be primary and

508
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:58,030
calculates how far from the top they

509
00:24:58,030 --> 00:25:00,130
should be which is easy to do because we

510
00:25:00,130 --> 00:25:01,900
already know how tall enough height is

511
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:03,910
the logo height is how tall each

512
00:25:03,910 --> 00:25:07,390
individual nav item is so when we apply

513
00:25:07,390 --> 00:25:10,900
that say position six items we get a top

514
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:12,850
position for all six they know exactly

515
00:25:12,850 --> 00:25:16,510
where they need to be nice and the mix

516
00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:18,520
in itself does all the work for us and

517
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:22,750
the less is a mixin to position the more

518
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:24,460
button because the more button now needs

519
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:28,150
to know where all the nav items above it

520
00:25:28,150 --> 00:25:30,100
are and how many nav items are actually

521
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:35,620
visible so now this is just kind of like

522
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:38,830
a base well not really based this is

523
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:42,820
kind of a CSS to kind of kick start

524
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:44,050
everything so we're going to take our

525
00:25:44,050 --> 00:25:45,940
first ally that we know is our logo

526
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:47,590
we're going to set the height on it

527
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:50,710
we're going to call the mixin highlight

528
00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:53,860
so we're telling it to be 95 pixels wide

529
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:56,200
to go absolutes go to the right and our

530
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,820
exception here is that we're telling it

531
00:25:57,820 --> 00:26:00,790
how tall it needs to be and then the

532
00:26:00,790 --> 00:26:02,500
other exception is that the image

533
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:04,610
actually needs to fill the container

534
00:26:04,610 --> 00:26:09,070
not be this tiny little icon and the

535
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:12,320
next line is based on our minimum offset

536
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,150
we need to make sure we stylized the

537
00:26:14,150 --> 00:26:16,970
minimum amount of primary a map items

538
00:26:16,970 --> 00:26:18,590
that we want in this case it's three

539
00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:20,510
that's what gets passed to the mixin so

540
00:26:20,510 --> 00:26:22,340
we tell the first three nav items after

541
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:25,610
the logo to be stylized and move to the

542
00:26:25,610 --> 00:26:29,870
right and now we kick start the position

543
00:26:29,870 --> 00:26:32,750
magic where we're saying all right as of

544
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:36,080
the second one start positioning all the

545
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:41,120
nav items and now for the fun part where

546
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,400
I had to pull back my little school math

547
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:50,000
and reverse engineer the a.m value for

548
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,860
for the body essentially I'm just trying

549
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:55,850
to get back to the root am I don't know

550
00:26:55,850 --> 00:26:57,290
how I walk through this but it's in

551
00:26:57,290 --> 00:27:00,110
there so I figured I should show it but

552
00:27:00,110 --> 00:27:01,760
I'm essentially just figuring out the

553
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:07,700
first fraction for how much how tall the

554
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:09,830
nav is accounting for all the items that

555
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:12,440
you want to show and putting that

556
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:16,790
against the font size and then giving me

557
00:27:16,790 --> 00:27:20,540
the e/m back to what our body is instead

558
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:22,370
of the actual nav the nav thinks

559
00:27:22,370 --> 00:27:24,950
everything is based off of 11px but my

560
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:26,179
media query is going to be based off of

561
00:27:26,179 --> 00:27:29,660
the body which is typically the browser

562
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:33,440
default of 16 pixels and then in that

563
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:38,179
same media query we are going to at this

564
00:27:38,179 --> 00:27:41,150
point decide when there's no longer

565
00:27:41,150 --> 00:27:45,320
enough room for the nav items to remove

566
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:47,660
them from the primary section and let

567
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:49,910
them go back into their the native

568
00:27:49,910 --> 00:27:52,970
position off the screen and essentially

569
00:27:52,970 --> 00:27:55,610
I'm just saying you know using an inch

570
00:27:55,610 --> 00:27:59,660
child saying show the first four if

571
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:01,160
there's no space so the first five

572
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:03,860
there's enough space and in order to do

573
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:05,720
that I'm actually counting backwards in

574
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:07,520
my ad media query instead of a typically

575
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:12,080
adding one and another thing worth

576
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,040
noting is that I actually had to

577
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:16,190
position the more button based on a max

578
00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:16,730
hi

579
00:28:16,730 --> 00:28:18,590
and we're doing the opposite for the

580
00:28:18,590 --> 00:28:20,150
individual primary items where we're

581
00:28:20,150 --> 00:28:21,260
doing it on a minimum height so if

582
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:22,850
there's at least this one enough room

583
00:28:22,850 --> 00:28:24,679
before show for if there's enough room

584
00:28:24,679 --> 00:28:31,280
five show five and here is video that I

585
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:37,669
think will plays with showing then have

586
00:28:37,669 --> 00:28:55,340
an action so yeah that's that's my best

587
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:58,580
use case actually for for for vertical

588
00:28:58,580 --> 00:29:00,770
media whores right now and as you saw

589
00:29:00,770 --> 00:29:02,660
it's not a responsive solution it's not

590
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:06,260
squishy we were originally going to go

591
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:08,929
with a squishy solution because it's the

592
00:29:08,929 --> 00:29:10,490
easy solution in this instance we could

593
00:29:10,490 --> 00:29:12,230
just make the more button fixed to the

594
00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:14,450
bottom and then tell the client that no

595
00:29:14,450 --> 00:29:16,100
it's really cool actually you can scroll

596
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:18,790
with in this 95 pixel wide container

597
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:21,410
which would have worked but the

598
00:29:21,410 --> 00:29:24,350
experience wouldn't have been great so

599
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:29,320
now instead we have a perfectly flexible

600
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:32,600
component that can live on any VW

601
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:36,020
property based on a really simple set of

602
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:39,020
rules and it's my best use case right

603
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:43,070
there so what else can we do just some

604
00:29:43,070 --> 00:29:45,230
ideas because really what I wanted to do

605
00:29:45,230 --> 00:29:47,150
in this talk is kind of motivate other

606
00:29:47,150 --> 00:29:49,750
people to start thinking about height

607
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:54,110
it's easy to overlook it let's stop so

608
00:29:54,110 --> 00:29:55,700
other options are single page

609
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:58,730
navigations galleries you know you have

610
00:29:58,730 --> 00:30:00,860
captions that sit on top of your image

611
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:03,980
based on your screen size you might not

612
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:06,260
have room for that text anymore what are

613
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:07,790
you going to do with it you just hide it

614
00:30:07,790 --> 00:30:09,500
and say oh no you know mobile no one

615
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:10,970
wants to read the caption no we could

616
00:30:10,970 --> 00:30:12,440
probably do some really interesting

617
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:17,510
things figure it out scrolling sites and

618
00:30:17,510 --> 00:30:20,380
and takeovers those kind page

619
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:22,020
interstitial

620
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:25,710
or messages that are very subject to

621
00:30:25,710 --> 00:30:28,140
limited height because typically we

622
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:31,770
design them to hold 100 words and the

623
00:30:31,770 --> 00:30:36,180
client puts in a thousand so that's that

624
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:39,510
that's that's my argument for vertical

625
00:30:39,510 --> 00:30:41,730
media queries and I don't know how long

626
00:30:41,730 --> 00:30:44,520
that was hoping it was like 20 of 20

627
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:48,450
minutes so I thought and I said thank

628
00:30:48,450 --> 00:30:56,140
you

629
00:30:56,150 --> 00:30:57,760


630
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:57,770
you
