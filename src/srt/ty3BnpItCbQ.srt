00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:23,240

alright thanks for having me let's get

2
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:26,000
started so as he mentioned I'm Thomas

3
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,510
Reynolds this is me on github and also

4
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:31,310
my blog which has a bunch of additional

5
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:33,910
content kind of on 3d and middleman and

6
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:38,629
preprocessor topics I'm the creator

7
00:00:38,629 --> 00:00:41,180
middleman which is a static blogging

8
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:43,610
prototyping and front-end development

9
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:45,379
framework it basically gives you

10
00:00:45,379 --> 00:00:47,480
something like the power of rails and

11
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:49,640
allows you to use it in a static context

12
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:52,909
or if you're a purely web context or

13
00:00:52,909 --> 00:00:56,809
thick client I work at instrument which

14
00:00:56,809 --> 00:00:58,580
is a digital creative agency in Portland

15
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:01,100
Oregon we work on a whole host of

16
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:02,809
different things from film to

17
00:01:02,809 --> 00:01:08,219
Interactive's to web and also physical

18
00:01:08,229 --> 00:01:10,670
one of the things we just released

19
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:12,350
recently for the Google at i/o was the

20
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:15,950
Google map dive the map dive is seven

21
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:18,320
large instances of Chrome each running

22
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:21,200
on a different screen which is allows

23
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,289
you to dive 3d through this world and

24
00:01:23,289 --> 00:01:28,180
it's built in both WebGL and also CSS 3d

25
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:30,439
and something we worked on a little bit

26
00:01:30,439 --> 00:01:32,750
longer ago last November was Google

27
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:35,299
zeitgeist for this year which is a site

28
00:01:35,299 --> 00:01:36,590
that which you explored search trends

29
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:38,990
for Google over the past year and we

30
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:41,420
also embraced CSS 3d in here to kind of

31
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:46,520
bring a little extra spark so let's talk

32
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:49,850
about some 3d we're gonna talk about

33
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:52,460
WebGL WebGL is this massive topic you

34
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:54,710
write all your code and see or it

35
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:56,090
compiles down the C it runs on the

36
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:57,740
graphics card you can make video games

37
00:01:57,740 --> 00:01:59,420
you can do pretty much anything you want

38
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:01,880
in WebGL but this is CSS conference so

39
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:04,570
we're just gonna completely ignore that

40
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:08,740
so what does CD 3d CSS actually mean

41
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:11,300
it's written in CSS this most obvious

42
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:15,140
part it works with CSS so what that

43
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:18,920
means is like anything else in CSS by

44
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,569
just adding some 3d components you're

45
00:02:20,569 --> 00:02:21,950
not going to trample over the rest of it

46
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:23,390
and it's going to cascade so if you have

47
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:25,310
a style well you have an anchor tag that

48
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:26,780
looks a certain way when you move it

49
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:28,430
into 3d it's not going to stop working

50
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:29,750
that way it's going to work exactly the

51
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,610
same

52
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:33,689
interactions still work you can still

53
00:02:33,689 --> 00:02:37,230
attach hover pseudo selectors to things

54
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:39,180
that are in 3d the system will figure it

55
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:40,530
out your mouse will go where it's

56
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:41,879
supposed to go and everything will react

57
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:45,959
as expected and any other content in

58
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:47,609
there is also interactive so if you can

59
00:02:47,609 --> 00:02:49,409
tab through your forms you can have

60
00:02:49,409 --> 00:02:51,120
animations going that are controlled by

61
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,530
some entirely different system like

62
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:54,959
JavaScript and CSS is simply just moving

63
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:59,579
these things around for you one of the

64
00:02:59,579 --> 00:03:00,389
reasons I think this is really

65
00:03:00,389 --> 00:03:02,879
interesting is for mobile transitions so

66
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:04,859
we talked about 3d it's really easy to

67
00:03:04,859 --> 00:03:07,109
overdo everything and just a little bit

68
00:03:07,109 --> 00:03:08,459
of movement and you throw it on a

69
00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:09,689
website this is the size of like a

70
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:12,419
27-inch monitor then it's it's

71
00:03:12,419 --> 00:03:13,950
overbearing and it's too much and it's

72
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:15,930
everywhere but and mobile were

73
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:19,169
constrained and we're used to these side

74
00:03:19,169 --> 00:03:21,090
to side up and down for and backwards

75
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:23,189
page transitions a lot so I think 3d

76
00:03:23,189 --> 00:03:26,609
fits in here really well users expect a

77
00:03:26,609 --> 00:03:29,790
little bit of flair Apple maybe does a

78
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:31,109
little too much Flair but at least

79
00:03:31,109 --> 00:03:32,549
everyone's accustomed to seeing some of

80
00:03:32,549 --> 00:03:34,829
these kind of movements in a mobile

81
00:03:34,829 --> 00:03:38,790
context and the lack of transitions is

82
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:39,780
one of the things that screams to me

83
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:42,329
that it is not a native app or it does

84
00:03:42,329 --> 00:03:43,949
not behave the way users expect it to

85
00:03:43,949 --> 00:03:46,409
behave so it doesn't necessarily mean 3d

86
00:03:46,409 --> 00:03:48,030
but things should move and animate

87
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:50,310
smoothly and that's something we can do

88
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:52,139
it's not out of the realm of possibility

89
00:03:52,139 --> 00:03:56,150
for mobile web apps

90
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:59,190
there's plan I'm gonna discuss 3d

91
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:00,870
coordinate systems and how things move

92
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:03,419
in 3d and what that means in CSS every

93
00:04:03,419 --> 00:04:05,840
system is a little different the

94
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,220
definition of which direction is up is

95
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:10,709
not well-defined across multiple systems

96
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:13,650
CSS has its opinion on this but it may

97
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:16,530
not be the same as 3GS or any other kind

98
00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:20,430
of 3d modeling system and talk about the

99
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:23,250
transform style and how this which is

100
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:25,409
the only way you can access 3d

101
00:04:25,409 --> 00:04:29,009
transforms from CSS going to go over a

102
00:04:29,009 --> 00:04:31,979
couple really popular mobile transitions

103
00:04:31,979 --> 00:04:35,430
and how to reimplemented CSS then

104
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:37,560
finally I'm going to talk about some the

105
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,870
far future or near future possibilities

106
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:43,139
for this stuff looping back around to

107
00:04:43,139 --> 00:04:44,129
running code

108
00:04:44,129 --> 00:04:48,989
the GPU so this is your basic

109
00:04:48,989 --> 00:04:54,360
three-dimensional access system Z is

110
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:57,209
coming out towards you from the screen x

111
00:04:57,209 --> 00:04:58,679
and y are about how you expect it if

112
00:04:58,679 --> 00:04:59,729
you've ever done anything with

113
00:04:59,729 --> 00:05:02,309
positioning and CSS or a canvas except

114
00:05:02,309 --> 00:05:03,689
for everything is oriented around the

115
00:05:03,689 --> 00:05:05,550
center of this object as opposed to the

116
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:08,369
top left which is common in normal CSS

117
00:05:08,369 --> 00:05:13,919
and also in canvas to move things around

118
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:16,919
in 3d use the translation so the

119
00:05:16,919 --> 00:05:18,269
commands that you can pass in to

120
00:05:18,269 --> 00:05:21,119
transform which is the style element

121
00:05:21,119 --> 00:05:23,309
that allows us to do 3d transforms it's

122
00:05:23,309 --> 00:05:26,159
not prefixed here it's not prefixed

123
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:28,439
everywhere so I'm just going to leave it

124
00:05:28,439 --> 00:05:29,909
as its root version here which I believe

125
00:05:29,909 --> 00:05:31,469
runs in the most recent versions of

126
00:05:31,469 --> 00:05:34,050
Chrome and Firefox but the WebKit prefix

127
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:37,139
would still be necessary for mobile so

128
00:05:37,139 --> 00:05:38,879
what you pass into the transform style

129
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:41,309
is a series of commands and unlike a lot

130
00:05:41,309 --> 00:05:44,309
of CSS they don't overwrite each other

131
00:05:44,309 --> 00:05:45,959
if you do one too many and you don't

132
00:05:45,959 --> 00:05:47,969
need commas to separate them rather it's

133
00:05:47,969 --> 00:05:50,099
a set it's a series of steps that you're

134
00:05:50,099 --> 00:05:52,379
telling the object to make so the first

135
00:05:52,379 --> 00:05:55,759
step is you say I translate along X 100%

136
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:58,259
these translations are relative to the

137
00:05:58,259 --> 00:06:00,719
object being moved so it's not saying a

138
00:06:00,719 --> 00:06:02,159
hundred percent of the screen saying 100

139
00:06:02,159 --> 00:06:03,360
percent of the thing that's moving and

140
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:10,559
then you move it down by 10 pixels so if

141
00:06:10,559 --> 00:06:12,689
both these are normal you have to

142
00:06:12,689 --> 00:06:15,149
remember which direction Z is Z as it

143
00:06:15,149 --> 00:06:17,309
increases comes towards you as the as

144
00:06:17,309 --> 00:06:19,439
the viewer a negative puts you back

145
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:25,199
deeper into the scene and the common

146
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:26,249
units that we passed this are both

147
00:06:26,249 --> 00:06:31,199
percentages and pixels second most

148
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:32,429
important thing you can do in addition

149
00:06:32,429 --> 00:06:34,199
to moving in 3d is also rotating in 3d

150
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:36,689
here again we have commands rotated X

151
00:06:36,689 --> 00:06:38,999
rotate Y and rotate Z these can be

152
00:06:38,999 --> 00:06:40,889
stacked on top of each other and in

153
00:06:40,889 --> 00:06:45,689
order these rotate around the axis which

154
00:06:45,689 --> 00:06:48,479
means it's not entirely intuitive what

155
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:50,369
that means so I have a demo in just a

156
00:06:50,369 --> 00:06:52,610
second and I'll show you what that means

157
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:54,580
there

158
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:56,560
there are degrees you can go negative

159
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,379
and go positive zeros is facing directly

160
00:06:59,379 --> 00:07:02,229
as you would expect forward you can also

161
00:07:02,229 --> 00:07:04,120
use radians but unless you have a

162
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:07,780
preprocessor or something or CSS math

163
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:09,580
library then it's going to be kind of a

164
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:13,539
pain to work with radians and finally

165
00:07:13,539 --> 00:07:14,680
there's a perspective the perspective

166
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:17,139
sets the distance of the viewer from the

167
00:07:17,139 --> 00:07:24,189
scene without this the browser won't

168
00:07:24,189 --> 00:07:25,629
even kick in the GPU you won't get any

169
00:07:25,629 --> 00:07:27,610
3d animations at all so you have to put

170
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:29,650
this on a parent somewhere above the

171
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:34,419
elements you're animating this number it

172
00:07:34,419 --> 00:07:36,819
basically it's saying how far you are

173
00:07:36,819 --> 00:07:39,099
from the object and so if you're closer

174
00:07:39,099 --> 00:07:40,810
to it things would be more exaggerated

175
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:43,300
if you're far away big movements are

176
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:46,779
going to look smaller there's some magic

177
00:07:46,779 --> 00:07:49,240
numbers somewhere between 400 and 2,000

178
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:52,180
usually you look just about right so I

179
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:59,979
know that was all very abstract so

180
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:01,389
here's some actual code and some

181
00:08:01,389 --> 00:08:03,009
interactive elements so we have a square

182
00:08:03,009 --> 00:08:04,180
and we're going to apply these

183
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:07,719
transforms that aren't on top to it so

184
00:08:07,719 --> 00:08:09,550
if we move X and move left to right like

185
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:11,740
you would expect Y is up and down and

186
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:14,289
the magic is in Z as we increase it it

187
00:08:14,289 --> 00:08:16,389
comes closer to you or recedes into the

188
00:08:16,389 --> 00:08:21,039
background the rotation is along those

189
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:23,319
three dimensional axes so X which runs

190
00:08:23,319 --> 00:08:24,909
from left to right means that it'll flip

191
00:08:24,909 --> 00:08:28,180
over the top Y runs from top to bottom

192
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:31,719
it'll flip from side to side Z runs

193
00:08:31,719 --> 00:08:34,029
towards you and you get just a normal

194
00:08:34,029 --> 00:08:40,060
kind of rotation so you can see that as

195
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:43,360
we start to rotate something the thing

196
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,649
that tricks our brain and thinking that

197
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:47,140
it's actually a 3d object is is the

198
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:50,400
angle

199
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:52,390
perspective right now is is pretty huge

200
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:53,860
we can we can increase it and get

201
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:55,150
further away from the object and you'll

202
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:58,000
see that that angle increases a little

203
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,220
bit if we get really close up into it it

204
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:08,200
becomes kind of absurd as I mentioned

205
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,570
before transform applies these commands

206
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:12,520
in order so if you translate something

207
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:14,020
then rotate it's different from rotates

208
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:15,220
and rotating something and then

209
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:18,780
translating it so for example if we take

210
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:21,550
this and rotate it off to the side and

211
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:24,280
then we move it out along Z it doesn't

212
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:26,020
move towards the camera per se that's

213
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:27,220
right it does in this case it moves

214
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:28,990
first camera exactly like I said it

215
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:32,170
would but if we reversed order commands

216
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:33,670
so that we rotate it first and then

217
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:38,170
translate it basically are picking your

218
00:09:38,170 --> 00:09:41,560
angle Z according to the object is still

219
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:42,790
straight out in front of it even though

220
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:44,470
it's off to the side for us so now when

221
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:55,960
we move Z it moves along its own axis

222
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:59,160
so can you actually use this thing it's

223
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:02,130
great it's in all modern browsers it's

224
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:04,560
on mobile I haven't included opera here

225
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,820
but I assume it'll basically look

226
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:07,380
exactly like Chrome as soon as they're

227
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:09,810
done with that currently opera doesn't

228
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:12,300
support it but it's a niche thing

229
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:15,839
don't kill me if you work for opera it

230
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:17,640
also works on Mobile Safari and Chrome

231
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:18,630
for Android and iOS

232
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:22,910
for Android that means 3.0 and newer

233
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:26,250
there is the asterisk though ie10 has

234
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:27,450
not supported a property called

235
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:29,940
preserved 3d and I'm going to show why

236
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:31,620
this is so important that it basically

237
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:33,630
means that ie10 can't really even use

238
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:37,920
any of this stuff so preserve 3d is one

239
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,690
of only two options for the transform

240
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:43,980
style style the system basically says if

241
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:45,990
an item is nested beneath me in the Dom

242
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:48,810
how do i render it and the default is

243
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:51,360
flat which means ignore it if

244
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,800
something's transformed everything else

245
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,750
get below it gets the same transform so

246
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:56,430
the cascading transform over rights

247
00:10:56,430 --> 00:10:59,100
everything below it what you might

248
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:00,420
expect would actually be the default is

249
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:03,000
preserved 3d reserve 2d says if I rotate

250
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,170
something and then I rotate it's

251
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:05,880
apparent the original transform is

252
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,920
maintained and it just removes inside of

253
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:11,520
it so this isn't in 3d or in ie10

254
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,800
which means it's you can only do the

255
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:17,010
motors the surface kind of animations in

256
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:24,360
ie10 so here's four elements and they

257
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:28,350
live in a parent element and I rotate

258
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:31,170
them all I move them to Center I rotate

259
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:32,730
them and I just changed their Z like I

260
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:34,170
did before to push them out to the edges

261
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:36,750
of this cube now if I start trying to

262
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:39,300
rotate it they collapse back down into a

263
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:41,130
single cube which doesn't make any sense

264
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:44,130
at all if we turn on preserved 3d

265
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:46,140
they'll maintain their internal

266
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:48,089
transform in addition to the parent

267
00:11:48,089 --> 00:11:49,260
transform that's rotating the entire

268
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:57,129
object

269
00:11:57,139 --> 00:12:00,920
alright so I'm gonna show off a couple

270
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:03,240
transitions common transitions on mobile

271
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,589
applications and show how to implement

272
00:12:04,589 --> 00:12:06,929
them this is Michael receding layers

273
00:12:06,929 --> 00:12:10,319
basically says in mobile like you eyes

274
00:12:10,319 --> 00:12:12,179
we often have layers on top of each

275
00:12:12,179 --> 00:12:13,589
other and they're revealed beneath them

276
00:12:13,589 --> 00:12:16,050
we could just slide this top off off of

277
00:12:16,050 --> 00:12:18,959
it but it's from behind so it actually

278
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:20,160
feels kind of nice to actually have it

279
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,350
moving forward towards you as if coming

280
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:28,679
from behind I've been watching our

281
00:12:28,679 --> 00:12:31,199
development all week and on the plane

282
00:12:31,199 --> 00:12:33,600
instead of cramming all right so here's

283
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:38,790
our animation tap on an object and it

284
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:39,929
moves off to the side and something

285
00:12:39,929 --> 00:12:41,910
comes from behind it so how do we

286
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:45,540
implement that so here's a two up view

287
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:46,920
of what's actually going on we have two

288
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:49,110
layers and then top right there's an

289
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:53,189
overhead view of the scene so it'll help

290
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:54,119
you know when something's behind

291
00:12:54,119 --> 00:12:55,679
something else so you can see that

292
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:56,929
they're beside each other right now

293
00:12:56,929 --> 00:12:59,819
there's the magical perspective value

294
00:12:59,819 --> 00:13:00,540
off in the corner

295
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:02,939
the first one is translated 100% of its

296
00:13:02,939 --> 00:13:04,709
own self off to the right so it

297
00:13:04,709 --> 00:13:06,929
basically takes it off screen and the

298
00:13:06,929 --> 00:13:10,740
other one is not moving at all so if we

299
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:11,939
go ahead and run that animation again

300
00:13:11,939 --> 00:13:14,100
all we're doing is translating the Z

301
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:16,319
negative 250 pixels back into the scene

302
00:13:16,319 --> 00:13:19,199
and you can see it moves back also in

303
00:13:19,199 --> 00:13:24,540
the overhead view so our default state

304
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:26,129
for this animation is when you come to

305
00:13:26,129 --> 00:13:28,799
this it's placed behind it and shrunken

306
00:13:28,799 --> 00:13:34,470
down already and then as it comes

307
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:36,509
forward we basically run a CSS

308
00:13:36,509 --> 00:13:38,249
transition from the negative to 250

309
00:13:38,249 --> 00:13:40,259
degree or negative to knit 50 pixel

310
00:13:40,259 --> 00:13:43,259
translation of Z back to 0 where you

311
00:13:43,259 --> 00:13:54,780
expect it to be

312
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:57,320
second super common animation especially

313
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:01,100
on iOS is the card flip so this demo has

314
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:03,019
been out for css3 forever and ever and

315
00:14:03,019 --> 00:14:04,850
ever it's it's pretty representative of

316
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:06,260
a bunch of more complicated things

317
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:08,209
you'll do so I'll show you how to put

318
00:14:08,209 --> 00:14:13,230
one of these together

319
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:19,310
so here's Tobias look in pert and we can

320
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:20,720
flip them around by interacting with

321
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:25,070
this and double-clicking so again we

322
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:26,810
have two objects we have a friend in the

323
00:14:26,810 --> 00:14:29,120
back and we bring off side to side from

324
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,410
each other so you have to get an idea of

325
00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:34,370
what's going on we rotate this it

326
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:37,519
rotates in place and rather than seeing

327
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:39,800
some unknown backside of this object we

328
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:47,449
actually see the mirror image so when we

329
00:14:47,449 --> 00:14:48,860
move it put it back and we flip it on

330
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:50,540
backwards and put it behind itself it

331
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:52,370
ends up clipping over at the top of the

332
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:54,860
original images because they're both at

333
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:57,920
the same translation of Z equals zero so

334
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,120
the system doesn't know which one's

335
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,750
actually in front of the other what we

336
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:04,310
can do is use a property called back

337
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:06,050
phase visibility which basically tells

338
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:08,149
the object if we can see the back side

339
00:15:08,149 --> 00:15:09,740
of it we actually want to see through it

340
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:12,860
so that way when this back face as you

341
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:14,529
can see is facing the other direction

342
00:15:14,529 --> 00:15:16,970
it's invisible facing it from the front

343
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:20,269
direction now we can take the parent

344
00:15:20,269 --> 00:15:22,370
object of both of these objects and we

345
00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:24,890
can animate that and it'll move the

346
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:25,670
things inside of it

347
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:29,660
because we have reserved 3d so they both

348
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:31,519
move together this isn't two separate

349
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:32,949
animations you're just moving the parent

350
00:15:32,949 --> 00:15:36,740
and running the CSS transition one thing

351
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:38,060
you might notice is we're actually

352
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:39,760
clipping at the top of this animation

353
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:46,189
which is pretty cool pretty tacky

354
00:15:46,199 --> 00:15:48,639
alternatively if we wanted to avoid

355
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:51,069
clipping as we animate we can just move

356
00:15:51,069 --> 00:15:53,110
our camera back or the object back

357
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:54,459
however you want to think about it

358
00:15:54,459 --> 00:15:56,740
while the animation is running so in

359
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:58,660
this case we have a little CSS animation

360
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:01,149
that says very quickly we're going to

361
00:16:01,149 --> 00:16:03,670
move this whole thing back to no pixels

362
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:06,279
and continue on rotating and because the

363
00:16:06,279 --> 00:16:08,440
order we've given it it doesn't affect

364
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:12,100
how the rotation actually looks so goes

365
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:25,670
back rotates comes forward

366
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:29,200
third example our carousels so these are

367
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,940
used rather sparingly but you can see

368
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:32,890
that the animation at the top is

369
00:16:32,890 --> 00:16:36,430
rotating on a cube so as it folds in it

370
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:38,140
looks like it has four sides and gives

371
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:46,730
it a nice little bit of depth

372
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:50,850
I'd say here's Jobe so we have two sides

373
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:54,060
job's on each and they rotate as if on a

374
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:57,270
cube so we want to inspect this scene

375
00:16:57,270 --> 00:16:58,250
you can see what's actually going on

376
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:01,470
we've got a center point which is zero

377
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:02,010
zero zero

378
00:17:02,010 --> 00:17:05,189
we've moved one the first frame closer

379
00:17:05,189 --> 00:17:07,050
and we've rotated and move the second

380
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:09,329
one off to the side in a square to be

381
00:17:09,329 --> 00:17:15,120
acute I've also kept some of the code

382
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:16,470
from the last slide where they move back

383
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:18,929
in space before continuing so it doesn't

384
00:17:18,929 --> 00:17:26,600
clip so terribly but cubes are boring so

385
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:30,510
here's a Pentagon it's exact same except

386
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:33,809
for the math to make anagon is a little

387
00:17:33,809 --> 00:17:36,090
different than to make a square so

388
00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:37,920
there's some math in here that you can

389
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,840
review later it's pretty basic

390
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:42,600
it basically says I've given in number

391
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,550
of sides what is the position of the

392
00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:46,200
rotation of each object so that they

393
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,450
meet each other and make a shape so in

394
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:51,240
this case we have five sides so the

395
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:53,220
angle between them is 360 divided by

396
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:55,080
five and the distance from the center

397
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:57,150
point so that they meet up nicely is

398
00:17:57,150 --> 00:18:04,320
this nice trig function here's an

399
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,970
octagon it's pretty much the same thing

400
00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:07,350
to plug in new values if you're using

401
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:08,910
this is all written and all the demos

402
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:10,920
are in SAS so I just ran through some

403
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:14,640
loops and ran some math you can do a

404
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:19,620
more complicated transition shape and

405
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:21,360
then here's the clipped version as

406
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:24,470
opposed to extending outside the frame

407
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:26,640
you may notice that as we got to a

408
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,610
larger number of sides the center point

409
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:32,280
has disappeared way up into the top to

410
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:44,580
maintain the relationship between them

411
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:46,400
all right so that's what you can do now

412
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,550
and I think it looks great on mobile

413
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:51,710
runs great on mobile so it's it's worth

414
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:54,470
including on your apps but I will talk

415
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:55,820
about the near future and things that

416
00:18:55,820 --> 00:19:01,130
may not be entirely about CSS so as I

417
00:19:01,130 --> 00:19:02,270
mentioned we worked on the Google

418
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:04,940
zeitgeist site which was actually

419
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:05,900
written in three.js

420
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:08,240
and it uses a component called the CSS

421
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:11,570
3d renderer to translate the system of

422
00:19:11,570 --> 00:19:13,820
3gs which is a scene graph that lets you

423
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:16,070
move objects and nest them inside of

424
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:21,780
each other and what's that apply to CSS

425
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:24,500
and so all the JavaScript this giant

426
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,530
pile of JavaScript it outputs to just

427
00:19:26,530 --> 00:19:29,180
you know transforms and perspectives and

428
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:50,990
other styles inside of your CSS

429
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,550
this should not be this is responsive

430
00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:55,200
and it's responding correctly the screen

431
00:19:55,200 --> 00:20:25,880
is too small

432
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:36,240
all right I'm gonna give up on that one

433
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:38,410
all right so basically what we had was a

434
00:20:38,410 --> 00:20:40,930
2d map which would look kinda like a

435
00:20:40,930 --> 00:20:42,250
Google map and you're staring at it

436
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:43,960
with items on it as you interact with

437
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:46,600
the scene it folds down to appear if

438
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,570
it's laying on a table and all the

439
00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:56,320
Google map pins pop up from it another

440
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,710
thing we've done with the heavy use of

441
00:20:58,710 --> 00:21:01,240
3d and CSS and also in three.js

442
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:03,400
is a Google map dive I'll show a short

443
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,650
little video of how that project

444
00:21:05,650 --> 00:21:12,240
actually worked if the Wi-Fi cooperates

445
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:21,760
nice gonna RAM for 27 seconds all right

446
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,590
so the interesting thing about 3GS is

447
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:25,120
that you can render to multiple

448
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,730
renderers at the same time so it has a

449
00:21:27,730 --> 00:21:30,250
canvas renderer which tries to draw a 3d

450
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:33,100
scene in a 2d canvas api it has the 3GS

451
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:35,830
that sorry the CSS renderer which takes

452
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:38,140
CSS objects and rotates in 3d and it

453
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:40,450
also does WebGL all at the same time so

454
00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:42,160
we can do is you can combine these two

455
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:44,740
and stack them up because weird thing

456
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:46,180
about CSS 3d is that everything remains

457
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:48,190
interactive so if you want to have a 3d

458
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:50,290
scene you know objects on the cube or

459
00:21:50,290 --> 00:21:52,150
something you can still select text on

460
00:21:52,150 --> 00:21:53,290
them you can still interact with them

461
00:21:53,290 --> 00:21:54,910
you can still do hover events you can do

462
00:21:54,910 --> 00:21:56,680
all these great things but in WebGL

463
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:58,840
you're just drawing pixels basically and

464
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:01,150
doing UI in WebGL is super hard so you

465
00:22:01,150 --> 00:22:03,150
can do a hybrid approach where you do

466
00:22:03,150 --> 00:22:05,350
WebGL for all the fancy graphics and you

467
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:08,440
just CSS for all the UI 3GS matches them

468
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:10,060
up so they sit on top of each other and

469
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:12,820
they move like each other so this is the

470
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:16,390
map dive the bottom layer is the actual

471
00:22:16,390 --> 00:22:19,120
Google map this is just chrome running

472
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,280
here nothing fancy

473
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,500
the foreground the video game portion is

474
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:26,830
all int in WebGL and 3j s so these are

475
00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:29,110
3d models there's a camera chasing a

476
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:31,900
little man throughout the scene but it's

477
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:35,380
also it's confining the Google map which

478
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:44,960
was pure HTML with WebGL

479
00:22:44,970 --> 00:22:47,080
and finally the New York one of the near

480
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:48,940
future items is a CSS custom filter so

481
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:51,850
CSS custom filters is a means of taking

482
00:22:51,850 --> 00:22:53,650
the same kind of techniques and things

483
00:22:53,650 --> 00:22:55,900
that we can do in WebGL and moving them

484
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:59,500
to CSS and to be called from CSS so

485
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:01,900
these filters are little C functions

486
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:05,170
that run on the GPU and they change the

487
00:23:05,170 --> 00:23:07,960
positioning shape and colors of any

488
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:11,410
object they're run directly on GPU that

489
00:23:11,410 --> 00:23:13,450
means they're super fast you can make it

490
00:23:13,450 --> 00:23:14,920
I mean entire video games are made this

491
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:17,890
way currently there are only in chrome

492
00:23:17,890 --> 00:23:26,830
and they're behind a dev flag but

493
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:33,370
there's a ton of possibilities sorry

494
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:37,610
so adobe has given us the CSS filter lab

495
00:23:37,610 --> 00:23:39,540
which is a place where you can go play

496
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:45,510
with these animations so for example we

497
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:48,030
have a normal scene on the left hand

498
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:50,880
side we can apply a spherify CSS custom

499
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:55,200
filter at the bottom you can see how

500
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,330
that's applied so there's a vertex

501
00:23:57,330 --> 00:23:58,650
shader there's a fragment shader these

502
00:23:58,650 --> 00:24:00,210
are two little C functions one was

503
00:24:00,210 --> 00:24:02,460
responsible for taking a flat plane of

504
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:04,980
content from HTML and wrapping it in a

505
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:07,260
sphere the other responsible for doing

506
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:08,850
things like colors which gives it the

507
00:24:08,850 --> 00:24:15,990
shadow and the gradients across that you

508
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:18,420
can pass functions and numbers into

509
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:21,090
these shaders because they're in C there

510
00:24:21,090 --> 00:24:22,590
they run on the graphics card you can't

511
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:24,630
inspect them they're hard to use but you

512
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:26,250
can pass variables in from your side and

513
00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:28,050
you can run CSS transitions and CSS

514
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:30,150
animations on these values so you could

515
00:24:30,150 --> 00:24:31,350
have a transition that rotates this

516
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:41,080
sphere

517
00:24:41,090 --> 00:24:43,940
there's some other ones in here and

518
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:51,080
they're pretty great but the idea B is

519
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:52,610
basically being that we can in the near

520
00:24:52,610 --> 00:24:54,460
future take existing content and

521
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:57,220
transform it in a 3d way without

522
00:24:57,220 --> 00:24:59,210
breaking the content or interacting with

523
00:24:59,210 --> 00:25:02,330
so well 3d CS has to let us do planes

524
00:25:02,330 --> 00:25:04,490
and squares and simple rotations this

525
00:25:04,490 --> 00:25:06,049
will actually let us put things on a

526
00:25:06,049 --> 00:25:08,629
sphere you know light them on fire have

527
00:25:08,629 --> 00:25:10,190
them burst into confetti all kinds of

528
00:25:10,190 --> 00:25:15,549
crazy animations but we're gonna need

529
00:25:15,549 --> 00:25:19,039
GLSL C programmers to actually empower

530
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:20,299
us through that unless everyone wants to

531
00:25:20,299 --> 00:25:26,179
learn C it's made of a quick demo I

532
00:25:26,179 --> 00:25:27,379
don't know how long how quickly this

533
00:25:27,379 --> 00:25:29,869
will get into chrome but maybe my next

534
00:25:29,869 --> 00:25:31,519
year we'll be able to do the Fancy Pants

535
00:25:31,519 --> 00:25:34,639
page curl natively instead of as an

536
00:25:34,639 --> 00:25:42,890
image

537
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:44,850
all right and that's actually the end

538
00:25:44,850 --> 00:25:48,070
slides are up there on slides had that

539
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:50,920
URL all the code is in github it's all

540
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:52,090
run through middleman so you can get a

541
00:25:52,090 --> 00:25:54,970
boot course in that really quick but

542
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:56,590
it's also compiled there if you want to

543
00:25:56,590 --> 00:25:58,420
inspect any of the math and the sass

544
00:25:58,420 --> 00:26:00,700
functions it's also there all right
