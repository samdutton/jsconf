00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:13,240

hi thank you for having me here my name

2
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:17,110
is Tobias vice I'm working as a software

3
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:22,119
developer forex evil and one year ago we

4
00:00:22,119 --> 00:00:26,259
open sourced bonsai chess graphics and

5
00:00:26,259 --> 00:00:29,770
animation library and I think it's fair

6
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:34,270
to ask why yet another graphics and

7
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:36,310
animation library I mean there it feels

8
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:39,460
to be there tons of 2d expertly 2d

9
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:40,870
graphics animation lab without there

10
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:43,780
some claim to be really the fastest one

11
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:46,450
in certain situations on certain

12
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:49,960
platforms certain browsers and def mode

13
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:53,920
but i'm not going to compare performance

14
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,280
today and it's more about the api and

15
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,700
the architecture I think that's well

16
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:03,280
kind of unique at least the architecture

17
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:09,030
of bonsai Jas but first I I want to

18
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:13,479
introduce bonds edges a little bit so

19
00:01:13,479 --> 00:01:16,780
it's it's written in JavaScript I'm not

20
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:18,460
coffeescript or typescript or whatever

21
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:20,200
script at all it's a it's written in

22
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:23,219
JavaScript and it has an SVG renderer

23
00:01:23,219 --> 00:01:28,479
also written by bias it's open source

24
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:31,329
yep since one year so feel free to

25
00:01:31,329 --> 00:01:33,969
contribute for you to fall back sir

26
00:01:33,969 --> 00:01:37,149
issues whatever and even so we have

27
00:01:37,149 --> 00:01:41,590
tests and and use it in production eip I

28
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:43,719
is not finished yet we still try to

29
00:01:43,719 --> 00:01:45,700
learn from our use cases and the use

30
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:50,469
cases from the user's phone from bonds

31
00:01:50,469 --> 00:01:54,009
ideas yeah and the website is sponsor

32
00:01:54,009 --> 00:01:59,200
gesture dark so you can are a lot of

33
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:03,389
stuff Afonso Jess you can draw shapes

34
00:02:03,389 --> 00:02:07,140
shapes have attributes you can apply

35
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:12,030
filter the filters like this drop shadow

36
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:15,160
you can animate your attributes and the

37
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:17,260
whole thing is to express your

38
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:22,680
creativity for example to

39
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:29,030
to to create infographics or to do maybe

40
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:36,680
little games or educational software yet

41
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:40,240
it it is supposed to work by the way I

42
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:47,120
don't know whatever that the funny thing

43
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:51,620
about that movie by the way is it's it's

44
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:56,360
created in the flesh ide so how did that

45
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,190
work and that brings me to another

46
00:02:58,190 --> 00:03:00,920
product that is not open sourced it's

47
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:03,440
for also for mock Sybil and it's picks

48
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,860
the plant and picks the plant is a flash

49
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:10,940
to html5 converter so by flesh I mean

50
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:14,930
swf files so we really take the binary

51
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:20,660
and yeah so we can work actionscript to

52
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:28,750
as well as actionscript-3 swf 12 11 and

53
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:32,239
and bonsai is the graphics library

54
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:35,739
behind pixel plant so pics van actually

55
00:03:35,739 --> 00:03:39,709
transforms the abscess wf2 bonsai code

56
00:03:39,709 --> 00:03:43,700
and that's one reason also one reason

57
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:45,920
why we did why we did it why we build it

58
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,810
because other graphical a breeze didn't

59
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:51,470
provide all the API we need to to draw

60
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:55,730
our flash movies and and yeah that's one

61
00:03:55,730 --> 00:03:57,200
reason by bonsai is flavored with some

62
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,420
API that looks familiar to some flash

63
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:01,820
developer you can find pixel plan on

64
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:07,970
pixel plant calm ok let's dive into the

65
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:12,230
the API yeah first of all that's the

66
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:13,970
entry point of every movie its bonsai

67
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:19,190
run and any pass a Dom element I'm yeah

68
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:22,790
we take the Dom element place the movie

69
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:25,340
there we create a graphics context there

70
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:27,890
and second parameters this movie of

71
00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:30,410
course it kind of reference can be a

72
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:33,440
reference to to a file it can also be a

73
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,690
function

74
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:42,770
and I will go I become to the reason why

75
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:46,580
we don't we don't apply drawing

76
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:51,250
instructions on on the constructor I

77
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:55,190
will tell about it right now and let's

78
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:58,040
really let's I think it's one of the

79
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:02,990
smallest bonsai scripts possible and in

80
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:04,700
your movie in your bonsai movie you have

81
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:06,950
you have a global stage object and

82
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:11,120
whatever you add to the stage this yeah

83
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,490
it's supposed to be drawn on your screen

84
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:20,330
and and you a new movie runs in on

85
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:23,750
sandbox so what does that mean and that

86
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:25,490
means that yes you have actually no

87
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:27,950
access to the rest of your website you

88
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:32,060
don't have access to the dumb but it

89
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:35,410
allows us to take your movie and run it

90
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:37,970
nearly wherever we want so for example

91
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:41,180
an iframe of course okay that's that's

92
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:43,280
fair enough but also in a bad worker for

93
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:48,020
example so and of course on the server

94
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:51,169
but would be possible as well so yes we

95
00:05:51,169 --> 00:05:55,039
can execute your movie in these three

96
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:58,780
environments and and still able to draw

97
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:01,550
your drawing instructions to the screen

98
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:05,000
and there is a way to communicate

99
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,120
between your website which I call the

100
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:12,919
main thread and you your bonsai code

101
00:06:12,919 --> 00:06:15,020
there's API for that and I will show you

102
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:18,890
that a little bit later first of all I

103
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:23,360
thought okay how can I show API so let's

104
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,090
play pong okay I create a little game

105
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:29,360
and I'm by there to show you the API if

106
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:33,169
bonsai first of all I thought okay we

107
00:06:33,169 --> 00:06:35,360
need a background image of course the

108
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,720
rejection logo and so we simply create

109
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,030
in your bitmap and yeah we add it to the

110
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:44,270
stage and that and that's it so what's

111
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:45,289
next

112
00:06:45,289 --> 00:06:47,180
okay so we want to put it in the

113
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:50,029
background so I decided to apply filters

114
00:06:50,029 --> 00:06:52,389
wellness opacity the other one is blur

115
00:06:52,389 --> 00:06:56,059
the rest remains the same we also have

116
00:06:56,059 --> 00:06:58,729
other filters as well for example

117
00:06:58,729 --> 00:07:04,669
grayscale or CPR or or invert there are

118
00:07:04,669 --> 00:07:09,439
others as well please have a look at the

119
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:13,039
the docs and boxed up bonsly just a

120
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:16,399
torque and yeah you can draw simple

121
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:20,539
shapes I use the wrecked API to draw the

122
00:07:20,539 --> 00:07:24,680
pedals for pond and circle API to draw

123
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:29,930
the ball fill them there are more shapes

124
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:32,479
then what let's actually convenient API

125
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:36,770
right so star ellipse polygon we can we

126
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:39,199
could add more you as a user can add

127
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:44,830
more wild plugins the a generic object

128
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:49,389
for drawing shapes path is a path object

129
00:07:49,389 --> 00:07:51,860
the cool thing about the path object is

130
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:58,699
it takes SVG like syntax and and

131
00:07:58,699 --> 00:08:00,620
something you know from the canvas API

132
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:03,409
the PostScript like operators so what

133
00:08:03,409 --> 00:08:04,899
does it mean it means you can actually

134
00:08:04,899 --> 00:08:09,649
copy and paste your existing shapes to

135
00:08:09,649 --> 00:08:12,830
the path and pass it to the path object

136
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:22,490
and it is supposed to work okay yeah as

137
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:26,749
there's a Calliope I of course but it's

138
00:08:26,749 --> 00:08:32,659
kind of rich and and it turns out it

139
00:08:32,659 --> 00:08:34,370
solves a communication problem between

140
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:38,959
the designer and the developer and by

141
00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:41,060
that I mean in South iterations when a

142
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:43,130
designer says can you please take the

143
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:44,630
following color and in develop a service

144
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:48,290
okay cool I take it and he says oh well

145
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:50,449
it's not exactly color one can you

146
00:08:50,449 --> 00:08:53,149
please make a little bit darker okay now

147
00:08:53,149 --> 00:08:54,949
that you've all possess will convene

148
00:08:54,949 --> 00:08:57,740
please just give them the color and yeah

149
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:58,950
we can help

150
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:03,690
we have lighter darker and midpoint hey

151
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:05,610
what about midpoint and if you just

152
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:09,140
can't agree you can also randomized

153
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:14,130
that's still possible and that is very

154
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:17,700
handy especially for gradients because

155
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:20,220
you now can say okay my first call is

156
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:24,480
blue my second color is also blue but a

157
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,090
little bit darker and that makes a

158
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:29,550
beautiful gradient I think I applied

159
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:35,640
those gradients on the pedals bonds are

160
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:43,250
also supports gradients okay utter is

161
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:46,800
the function we need to change any kind

162
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,950
of attributes so for example to change

163
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:57,690
the position we take x x and y it was

164
00:09:57,690 --> 00:09:59,490
also responsible for any other

165
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:05,520
transformations like scale or rotate and

166
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:10,830
it is also responsible for any styles

167
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:16,230
like colors for example and yep pointing

168
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:22,040
events are built in so that means we

169
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:25,290
abstracted the point events for touch

170
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:31,790
devices and for i say most devices and

171
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:35,700
that should work and it works yep so you

172
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:39,450
listen to the stage the stage is is that

173
00:10:39,450 --> 00:10:42,450
what is strong so we abstracted that by

174
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:45,870
by the word stage and then you can

175
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:47,580
listen to those events like pointer you

176
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:54,090
like pointer move just to be able to

177
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:56,610
show you the animation especially

178
00:10:56,610 --> 00:10:58,890
nonlinear animations I decided to

179
00:10:58,890 --> 00:11:00,840
animate the ball so we never read the

180
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:05,100
game start the ball is like this new you

181
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:10,260
cool so the API looks may be familiar to

182
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:11,769
most of you because

183
00:11:11,769 --> 00:11:13,809
is nothing new also used by other

184
00:11:13,809 --> 00:11:16,499
graphic libraries so you have a duration

185
00:11:16,499 --> 00:11:19,779
you pass all you attributes you want to

186
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:23,410
animate and have some options to also

187
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:27,069
change easing and end stuff we also have

188
00:11:27,069 --> 00:11:29,739
you frame animations that's nothing else

189
00:11:29,739 --> 00:11:32,589
it's it's just animation where you can

190
00:11:32,589 --> 00:11:35,319
decide to change the attribute at a

191
00:11:35,319 --> 00:11:38,769
certain time but it's still all about

192
00:11:38,769 --> 00:11:40,929
changing attributes and this is really

193
00:11:40,929 --> 00:11:43,480
just convenient API it's what we do

194
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,910
inside is we change an attribute which

195
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:48,399
is path so what you can do with more

196
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:51,309
tools actually you can switch from Earth

197
00:11:51,309 --> 00:12:00,549
to ball by mopping all the shapes yep

198
00:12:00,549 --> 00:12:02,649
this is this is a the abstraction layer

199
00:12:02,649 --> 00:12:05,579
of the timeout or interval or

200
00:12:05,579 --> 00:12:08,350
requestanimationframe you can listen on

201
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:13,509
the tick you can listen and a tick event

202
00:12:13,509 --> 00:12:17,589
and and place all your business logic

203
00:12:17,589 --> 00:12:20,889
within that callback for example yeah I

204
00:12:20,889 --> 00:12:24,249
decided to write a plug-in and now we

205
00:12:24,249 --> 00:12:29,049
have walls and the ball yeah I think we

206
00:12:29,049 --> 00:12:32,709
can you can play now right so I will do

207
00:12:32,709 --> 00:12:39,009
that just to proof it's possible yeah

208
00:12:39,009 --> 00:12:45,480
okay go um thank you very much

209
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:48,490
so I think it's much more fun if you

210
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:51,190
have if we would have sound so um the

211
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:53,410
thing is you you create new sound and

212
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:57,149
you edit tools to the stage as if it

213
00:12:57,149 --> 00:13:00,010
should be drawn so that's the way we do

214
00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:01,660
it and then when it's when it's there

215
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:04,000
and you can listen on the call back like

216
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,060
load it's alcoholic and then you okay

217
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:09,760
it's available and you can play pause

218
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:13,060
and play whatever you want so I don't

219
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:18,330
you need to play and it still works and

220
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:21,790
and I think that is very important

221
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:25,300
regarding rich rich media to come on and

222
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:29,560
I think that that's I think that's very

223
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:34,810
important eragon rich media and it ends

224
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:38,290
are using this heavily so and i think

225
00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:41,200
that's that's a really cool feature okay

226
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:48,610
so now as i said before we need a way to

227
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:51,520
communicate between the dom and your

228
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:54,940
bonsai movie for several reasons for

229
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:58,180
example if you want to listen on certain

230
00:13:58,180 --> 00:14:00,490
Dom events that are not available within

231
00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:05,020
bonsai what i did is i use the

232
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:08,050
orientation api by the dome which allows

233
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:12,070
me now to not use the arrow keys but

234
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:17,560
well just my device and now i can change

235
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:23,079
x and y and and use methods it's nice

236
00:14:23,079 --> 00:14:26,529
for this for this demo and but it's

237
00:14:26,529 --> 00:14:31,480
really nice for your touch devices so

238
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:35,260
this is about a custom messages it's

239
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:40,870
also useful for those abstraction layers

240
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:43,959
for for your data you normally use to

241
00:14:43,959 --> 00:14:48,000
update your dumb for example angular JS

242
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,579
that's also a way to update your movie

243
00:14:51,579 --> 00:14:54,370
when something happens within your main

244
00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:55,360
threat within

245
00:14:55,360 --> 00:15:02,500
you're within your website okay last I

246
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,720
think laughing I want to show you is a

247
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:10,660
smoothie API so most of who a few is

248
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:15,070
flash developer oh okay this is a

249
00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:20,980
JavaScript conference so I think it

250
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:24,670
would be okay if you're okay whatever

251
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:27,850
and so there's the movie ipi and there's

252
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:31,690
this playlist kind of an array and it's

253
00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:33,790
really from familiar to those flash

254
00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:36,730
developers and the cool thing is you can

255
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:40,959
load a synchronously movies which are

256
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:43,990
nothing else then bonsai movies which is

257
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:47,560
which is a container let's say container

258
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:49,959
for another movie and you can load them

259
00:15:49,959 --> 00:15:53,350
within your bonsai movie so what this is

260
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:58,560
a very simple example where we have a

261
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:03,160
load in metro and and whenever the game

262
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:05,230
pong is completely loaded we're going to

263
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:07,899
get rid of that intro and start the game

264
00:16:07,899 --> 00:16:10,390
so I destroy my intro and play the game

265
00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:13,540
so to simulate it like clicks Oh Zeebo

266
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:16,180
presents is the intro and bam ok here we

267
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:19,449
are that's the game and that's one part

268
00:16:19,449 --> 00:16:23,320
of the movie API there is a timeline and

269
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:25,990
you can specify the timeline by frames

270
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:32,050
by in percent or I don't know and and

271
00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:35,860
and n seconds of course if you use

272
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:38,230
percent please don't forget to set the

273
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:42,300
length of the weekly weather in one work

274
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:46,540
ok let's sum it up we have this player

275
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:50,860
object path bitmaps we have text we have

276
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:53,529
audio we also have experimental video

277
00:16:53,529 --> 00:16:56,769
yes we do support that's the display

278
00:16:56,769 --> 00:16:58,949
objects you can put this play object in

279
00:16:58,949 --> 00:17:02,740
I come to it later this project have

280
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:06,470
attributes for changing the style

281
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:10,770
transforms and transform and and those

282
00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:15,600
attributes are animatable you can put

283
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,010
those display objects in the speed

284
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:20,699
objects containers which our group very

285
00:17:20,699 --> 00:17:22,260
simple container with but you can also

286
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:26,760
apply attribute on the container and of

287
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:29,640
course the movie which has a timeline

288
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:36,840
for linear any linear animation ok let's

289
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:39,929
go to the architecture and you already

290
00:17:39,929 --> 00:17:43,049
knows it's ok so there is the renderer

291
00:17:43,049 --> 00:17:46,350
ok cool and my script is executed in

292
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:49,500
another environment yeah we decided to

293
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,690
to give this a name we call it runner

294
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:54,240
because it's not clear if we run it in

295
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,940
an worker in an iframe or on the server

296
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:59,490
so we said okay run out and between the

297
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:02,159
renderer which is supposed to be your

298
00:18:02,159 --> 00:18:04,830
website your main threat and the runner

299
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:09,789
there's of course a messaging protocol

300
00:18:09,799 --> 00:18:12,570
and so we can send the drawing

301
00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:15,360
instructions to from runner to the

302
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:18,149
renderer and events from renderer to the

303
00:18:18,149 --> 00:18:19,710
runner and your custom messages of

304
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:25,409
course that looks like this you use new

305
00:18:25,409 --> 00:18:29,789
path as an API it is executed we make it

306
00:18:29,789 --> 00:18:31,770
we transform it to a drawing instruction

307
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:37,100
it looks like Jason at the moment um

308
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:40,289
that's nothing you really supposed to

309
00:18:40,289 --> 00:18:43,020
touch to be honest and using an SVG

310
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:45,390
renderer it looks like this yeah you

311
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:52,110
have SVG path yep ok one more reason why

312
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:54,899
we do this because if you want to

313
00:18:54,899 --> 00:19:00,549
benefit from an web worker for example

314
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:04,549
we think it could be faster and

315
00:19:04,549 --> 00:19:07,140
regarding the frame budget so what is

316
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:09,510
the frame budget the frame budget is the

317
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:11,640
time the amount of time you have with a

318
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:14,520
new frame and the frame could be maybe

319
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,429
just six

320
00:19:16,429 --> 00:19:19,820
milliseconds that's not much and you do

321
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:21,499
a lot of stuff in that 60 milliseconds

322
00:19:21,499 --> 00:19:24,820
you have for example your timer

323
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:27,559
requestanimationframe whatever another

324
00:19:27,559 --> 00:19:30,470
javascript stuff you have a lot of

325
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:33,049
painting especially regarding an SVG

326
00:19:33,049 --> 00:19:36,289
renderer you are as I'm by painting I

327
00:19:36,289 --> 00:19:41,559
mean layout pane compositing styling and

328
00:19:41,559 --> 00:19:44,419
you definitely need to compute the next

329
00:19:44,419 --> 00:19:47,360
frame yeah and and that's what I'm going

330
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:57,080
to talk about whoops yeah thank you I

331
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:59,299
just want to talk about the next frame

332
00:19:59,299 --> 00:20:03,289
so why are we doing this in the renderer

333
00:20:03,289 --> 00:20:06,409
yes that's the question why don't we

334
00:20:06,409 --> 00:20:08,659
shift the computation of the next frame

335
00:20:08,659 --> 00:20:13,460
to another threat which can be run side

336
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:18,559
by side so now we have much more time

337
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:22,460
for painting we can do more stuff we can

338
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:25,639
use the SVG renderer even longer and and

339
00:20:25,639 --> 00:20:27,379
okay that graphic is not actually

340
00:20:27,379 --> 00:20:29,840
completely a fair there's still some

341
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:32,269
overhead by sending the data from the

342
00:20:32,269 --> 00:20:35,570
runner to the renderer so okay let's put

343
00:20:35,570 --> 00:20:38,570
it like this so we need to send the data

344
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:42,110
and we need to receive the data through

345
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:45,559
the messaging channel and then we can

346
00:20:45,559 --> 00:20:48,259
draw our drawing instruction so that's

347
00:20:48,259 --> 00:20:50,570
another reason why you think our

348
00:20:50,570 --> 00:20:55,460
architecture makes sense ok let's go in

349
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:57,110
a little bit of the detail about runner

350
00:20:57,110 --> 00:20:59,299
I think you most of the informations are

351
00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:01,669
already clear so what is what can the

352
00:21:01,669 --> 00:21:06,289
context be web web worker is used by

353
00:21:06,289 --> 00:21:12,289
default so an iframe environment I would

354
00:21:12,289 --> 00:21:13,999
choose the I for environment while

355
00:21:13,999 --> 00:21:21,039
developing because mostly the dev tools

356
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:25,609
support of your browser is much better

357
00:21:25,609 --> 00:21:27,859
for an iframe than in web borracha I

358
00:21:27,859 --> 00:21:30,410
think a chrome does a quite good job

359
00:21:30,410 --> 00:21:34,040
even console lock works now but yeah

360
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:40,160
that's that's one that's one point but

361
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:42,590
in production i would say web burkas is

362
00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:46,880
the choice and yeah note for example

363
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:52,010
with socket i/o whatever and yeah we

364
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:54,740
have one render piranha means whenever

365
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:57,950
you whenever you say bonsai run you

366
00:21:57,950 --> 00:22:02,780
actually spawn another bad broker but

367
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:05,150
it's still possible to have mild will

368
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:07,970
render us but just one runner let's

369
00:22:07,970 --> 00:22:10,670
that's kind of interesting if you wanna

370
00:22:10,670 --> 00:22:13,130
have a a multiplayer game for example

371
00:22:13,130 --> 00:22:17,120
then you just compute the next frame on

372
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:20,060
the server and you get all information

373
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:22,880
from the different devices and send the

374
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,800
drawing only the drawing and stretch and

375
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:29,470
structures nothing more to the devices

376
00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:33,230
please don't expect me to claim this is

377
00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:37,580
really a good idea for I don't know age

378
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:41,450
of empire or stuff like that and there

379
00:22:41,450 --> 00:22:44,330
are too many drawing instructions but it

380
00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:49,370
should be really work very well with for

381
00:22:49,370 --> 00:22:53,210
example a ticker or something like pong

382
00:22:53,210 --> 00:22:58,690
I think that's let's let's fair enough

383
00:22:58,690 --> 00:23:04,850
okay renderer first of all via renderer

384
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:10,010
agnostic that's that's that's a big

385
00:23:10,010 --> 00:23:13,240
message because we are able to exchange

386
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:16,460
the renderer so we what we did is we

387
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:19,760
wrote an SVG renderer but we are able to

388
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:22,640
take any other renderer out there as

389
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:25,280
long as the renderer understands our

390
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,590
drawing instructions we sent from the

391
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:32,420
runner to to the renderer and html5 is

392
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:35,510
in work menu using CSS and HTML and

393
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:38,360
canvas and SVG and everything

394
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:42,310
canvas I was a near future let's see

395
00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:44,510
also depends on how many people are

396
00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:47,000
contributing to the project and well

397
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:51,440
WebGL in the future he's feel free to

398
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:54,700
add and WebGL render I would be happy

399
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:59,390
why SVG yeah ok as we love with SVG API

400
00:23:59,390 --> 00:24:03,500
it's so rich that's why there are so

401
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:05,270
many bugs and implementation I think

402
00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:07,730
it's just too rich but it has all the

403
00:24:07,730 --> 00:24:11,780
API we need to be able to transform the

404
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:16,340
flash instructions to html5 instructions

405
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:21,590
and there yeah that's that's that's the

406
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:24,290
thing about the SVG renderer and we used

407
00:24:24,290 --> 00:24:27,260
it before and yeah we will really like

408
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:32,660
it okay um so let's sum it up what are

409
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:36,800
the benefits of bonsai Jess ok we have

410
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:41,420
the computation decoupled and like logic

411
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:45,650
decoupled from the actual drawing we

412
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:50,030
have one messaging protocol for that's

413
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:53,630
cool I think what I want to say is we

414
00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:56,810
have just one messaging protocol and we

415
00:24:56,810 --> 00:24:59,540
have multiple renderer so we only need

416
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:04,430
to let the renderer speak the protocol

417
00:25:04,430 --> 00:25:08,690
and then we can use it the renderer may

418
00:25:08,690 --> 00:25:12,320
block the main threat but it is not

419
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:13,820
supposed to block the runner when you

420
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:15,890
run your movie in the worker for example

421
00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:19,940
that can happen for different reasons

422
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:23,120
for example a lot of events most events

423
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:27,290
touch events whatever events it's it's

424
00:25:27,290 --> 00:25:30,980
kind of a rich and simple API because we

425
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:32,810
have been forced to support the minimum

426
00:25:32,810 --> 00:25:35,270
API to to render all the flash movies

427
00:25:35,270 --> 00:25:38,690
and yeah it's open source so you can see

428
00:25:38,690 --> 00:25:42,320
the code change it you can also see the

429
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:48,220
tests which are the spec um yeah and

430
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:51,910
there's a list of links

431
00:25:51,910 --> 00:25:58,810
I i prepared orbit bondages org this is

432
00:25:58,810 --> 00:26:01,810
where you can play around around a

433
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:04,180
little with bondages it's an editor on

434
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:05,620
the left side you see your script on the

435
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:12,010
right side you see what's what's going

436
00:26:12,010 --> 00:26:15,910
to be drawn and this is actually quite

437
00:26:15,910 --> 00:26:22,180
good to see a lot of example code so we

438
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:34,430
also have orbit let's let's take group

439
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:41,770
this is a path yep the on the right side

440
00:26:41,770 --> 00:26:43,210
you can also see the folder commutation

441
00:26:43,210 --> 00:26:44,740
whenever you select something on the

442
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:47,860
left side and so we want to give a lot

443
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:50,710
of example code I think that's one of

444
00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:52,300
the most entering parts when you're new

445
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:54,220
to a library you want to see example

446
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:55,540
code you won't execute something you

447
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:58,450
want to play with it and that's what we

448
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:03,300
try it with orbit em so here a lot of

449
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:09,220
example movies for a lot of use cases

450
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:18,950
audio and info graphics and animations

451
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:27,790
some sweet pictures and I can't scroll I

452
00:27:27,790 --> 00:27:33,130
can scroll sometimes even we go into

453
00:27:33,130 --> 00:27:39,040
detail how we we tried to implement a

454
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:42,730
flash API I think it's kind of

455
00:27:42,730 --> 00:27:46,600
interesting to just scroll through the

456
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:54,440
list of example movies and I would say

457
00:27:54,450 --> 00:27:58,030
thank you very much please follow

458
00:27:58,030 --> 00:28:02,010
voltages for quite more informations and

459
00:28:02,010 --> 00:28:12,470
and that's it
