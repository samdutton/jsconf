[Music]

2
00:00:16,369 --> 00:00:21,180
hello all right awesome so like they

3
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:23,640
said we ate webassembly and the future

4
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,740
of JavaScript and a multi-language web

5
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:31,019
so as I mentioned I'm Casper ch besides

6
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:33,809
being a developer avocado at CloudFlare

7
00:00:33,809 --> 00:00:37,040
I am also a robotics author and addict

8
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,540
I've written two books on using

9
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:40,860
javascript with robotics

10
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:42,809
I also twitch stream hardware and

11
00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:45,809
software on Sundays from node botanist

12
00:00:45,809 --> 00:00:49,170
so yeah I'm also a parent of two cats

13
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:51,420
and like they're my favorite like

14
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:53,219
animals Laurel so that's ace on the left

15
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:54,780
and that's Aria on the right and they're

16
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:56,579
very angry with me because I've been

17
00:00:56,579 --> 00:00:59,160
gone for like three weeks and I may be

18
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:00,449
done for like another week they're

19
00:01:00,449 --> 00:01:03,210
really mad at me right now anyway yeah

20
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:05,250
that's not what you're here to here here

21
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:08,820
to here about come on what even is

22
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:09,840
webassembly

23
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,330
this is a five-year-old technology and

24
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:14,040
we're still answering I and the quiet

25
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,299
when you when you think about why it's

26
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:17,009
because no one's figured out how to use

27
00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:19,770
it until now oh people who are very very

28
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:21,659
hard to make this more accessible but we

29
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:22,830
still need to kind of have this talk

30
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:25,740
about like what is it even because I

31
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:28,049
think it's easier to answer what it's

32
00:01:28,049 --> 00:01:31,290
not first it's not a programming

33
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:34,560
language like you don't you ever run

34
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,570
LinkedIn recruiters would say like you

35
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:39,119
need ten years of nodejs experience like

36
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:43,320
in 20 in 2008 like it's it's like saying

37
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,869
I'm a web assembly programmer like you

38
00:01:45,869 --> 00:01:48,000
don't you don't program and webassembly

39
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,399
you don't write web assembly the second

40
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:52,290
is web assembly is not going to kill

41
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:54,000
JavaScript if javascript is the

42
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,390
cockroach of everything it's never going

43
00:01:57,390 --> 00:01:59,880
to die but especially not to web

44
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,439
assembly because it's not meant to kill

45
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:04,920
javascript and what assembly is not

46
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,719
something you can just ignore because

47
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:09,479
it's gonna go away I hope to convince

48
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:11,430
you in the next you know 28 or so

49
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:12,510
minutes

50
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:14,909
if anything you should be embracing it

51
00:02:14,909 --> 00:02:18,220
because it's the future

52
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:20,819
so whatever sorry button

53
00:02:20,819 --> 00:02:23,010
what webassembly is it is a compilation

54
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:25,920
target for other languages to compile to

55
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,890
you compile other languages to

56
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:31,650
webassembly and it's a specification and

57
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:32,700
a compiled target

58
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:35,730
it's an augmentation of the abilities of

59
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:38,069
JavaScript far from replacing JavaScript

60
00:02:38,069 --> 00:02:41,280
it is there to let JavaScript do what it

61
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,989
is good at and then do things that

62
00:02:42,989 --> 00:02:45,450
javascript is not good at and give back

63
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:49,500
the results but most importantly it's

64
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:53,760
pretty literally magic not literally

65
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,769
literally but like I'll explain it a bit

66
00:02:55,769 --> 00:02:57,510
there's a pun involved you know it's

67
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:58,760
fine

68
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:02,160
so web assembly has a compilation target

69
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:04,019
you write code in other languages and

70
00:03:04,019 --> 00:03:06,090
then compile them into web assembly rust

71
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:07,799
which is pretty much written for web

72
00:03:07,799 --> 00:03:11,879
assembly C and C++ go C sharp those are

73
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:13,500
just a few of the languages that have

74
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,209
web assembly available is like a pile

75
00:03:15,209 --> 00:03:17,700
target there are way too many to mention

76
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:19,799
and I'm certainly forgetting a few but

77
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:21,269
those are the four main ones that I can

78
00:03:21,269 --> 00:03:22,680
think of just right off the top of my

79
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,930
head especially with rust being pretty

80
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:27,989
much written to be optimized for web

81
00:03:27,989 --> 00:03:29,430
assembly though it's also just a pretty

82
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:30,870
cool programming language if you ever

83
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:33,060
get a chance to try it but then the

84
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:38,040
question you have to ask is what why why

85
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,139
would you write code for the web and

86
00:03:40,139 --> 00:03:42,299
other languages why would you do this

87
00:03:42,299 --> 00:03:44,609
why would you take pictures of Laurie

88
00:03:44,609 --> 00:03:46,290
Voss while he's giving talks like this

89
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:49,769
and then use them in other dogs there

90
00:03:49,769 --> 00:03:51,840
are so many reasons you would a want to

91
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,819
take pictures you Laurie Voss and B have

92
00:03:53,819 --> 00:03:57,870
webassembly in your life this is the

93
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:02,519
next Ajax for the browser and like I've

94
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:04,290
been seeing that a lot this weekend I've

95
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:06,000
gotten this reaction quite a few times

96
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,430
like oh yeah sure cats the next Ajax

97
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:11,970
okay cool but I mean it I'm I'm very

98
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:15,690
serious in the sense that Ajax gave huge

99
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:18,660
credibility and made client-side

100
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:21,150
applications possible and this is an

101
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:23,280
evolution of that this is the next step

102
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,690
of that

103
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:26,850
and that is an adorable Pokemon gift

104
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:28,140
that I found this morning and I was like

105
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:29,610
oh well now I gotta stick that in there

106
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:31,680
and so I had to pick the word evolution

107
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,980
to like stick I write slides around

108
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:38,940
gifts if you haven't noticed so now

109
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:42,420
you're like alright maybe maybe it's

110
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:45,090
like eight the next Ajax but like I'm

111
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:48,240
not whatever percent committed this is a

112
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,570
drawing that I did in OneNote this

113
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:55,500
morning of this is what I call ancient

114
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:59,970
dot PNG so this is back when we had HTML

115
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:02,240
renderers CSS engines and we had

116
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,520
JavaScript and all JavaScript did was

117
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,790
play mp3s in the browser annoyingly when

118
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:10,730
you opened a page thanks to MySpace and

119
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:13,890
back then the server had literally

120
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:17,190
everything everything was over here

121
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:20,490
where did my G go anyway um so you click

122
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:21,990
a link and it would return a page and

123
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:23,160
you click a link and it would return a

124
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,780
page and so on and so forth

125
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:27,330
you get a browser refresh every time you

126
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:29,990
needed new information from the server

127
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:35,030
so now this is what I call then dot PNG

128
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:39,750
we got Ajax which that's not the right

129
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:42,260
button that's the right button got Ajax

130
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:44,340
request the page and then get the page

131
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:46,680
and then we make an AJAX request without

132
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,540
refreshing the page and we'd get back a

133
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:50,970
result Ajax result a grx result maybe

134
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:53,250
there'd be another page request we got a

135
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:55,320
lot of single page applications out of

136
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,240
that as well and then the server became

137
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,280
a REST API that also served up the

138
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,250
occasional HTML CSS and J's file right

139
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:05,790
so this is what I call now this is what

140
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:08,790
I call now because now we have and web

141
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:10,890
assembly and I ran out of like sparkly

142
00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:12,510
colors so I have to use like this like

143
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:15,570
red and black super goth but it sticks

144
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:18,240
out so it works see a request the page

145
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,830
returned the page and then you use WebP

146
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:22,020
is simply to do some computation but

147
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:23,100
you're still over here in the browser

148
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:25,290
and use the serviceworker for your

149
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:26,820
third-party module and you're still over

150
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:28,470
here in the browser you use some Ajax

151
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:30,390
and your servers like lawl okay I'm not

152
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,190
even actually a server I'm just a server

153
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:33,900
list function sitting on someone else's

154
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:38,110
server and then gives back your results

155
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:42,879
we're heading ok now you're thinking ok

156
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:43,389
I get it

157
00:06:43,389 --> 00:06:44,919
ok this is starting to make a little

158
00:06:44,919 --> 00:06:47,050
more sense being able to compute things

159
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:49,210
in the browser and not necessarily have

160
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:51,099
to do it in JavaScript it's kind of a

161
00:06:51,099 --> 00:06:55,270
big deal this is kind of important but

162
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:57,250
why does this matter why why do we

163
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:00,370
really care we care because we need to

164
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:02,800
augment Jaso that's not so strong points

165
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,180
because I know this is something you've

166
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:05,770
probably either heard a million times

167
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:07,810
and is sick of hearing or it's blasphemy

168
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:09,639
or whatever but there's some things that

169
00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:12,520
jeaious isn't really good at not

170
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:14,740
rewriting entire code bases to use them

171
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:17,139
on the web who wants to rewrite an

172
00:07:17,139 --> 00:07:19,539
entire code base of any library that's

173
00:07:19,539 --> 00:07:21,159
like more than five years old and has

174
00:07:21,159 --> 00:07:24,280
unit tests yeah Eli hands me neither

175
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:27,159
there's no good fewer calls as a server

176
00:07:27,159 --> 00:07:29,199
means less latency and it means faster

177
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:31,150
web applications for your users that's

178
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:33,009
always important performance is good

179
00:07:33,009 --> 00:07:34,569
not having go back to the server a

180
00:07:34,569 --> 00:07:38,680
billion million times is good so let's

181
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,330
talk about augmenting JavaScript it it's

182
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:42,759
not so strong points I'm sure you've

183
00:07:42,759 --> 00:07:44,229
seen this at least once in your

184
00:07:44,229 --> 00:07:46,599
JavaScript career 0.1 plus point two is

185
00:07:46,599 --> 00:07:48,340
actually point three zero zero zero zero

186
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:51,639
zero zero zero zero four so that's false

187
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:54,129
and so if you're running anything that

188
00:07:54,129 --> 00:07:56,020
relies on mathematical numerical

189
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:59,469
accuracy financial applications anything

190
00:07:59,469 --> 00:08:01,990
they with socks or bond trading Kirt

191
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:04,659
currency conversion anything really that

192
00:08:04,659 --> 00:08:07,330
requires games require a lot of math

193
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:11,500
precision it's not really a JavaScript

194
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:14,949
strong point obviously you would need an

195
00:08:14,949 --> 00:08:16,810
ajax call back to a server that would

196
00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:18,039
run a different language and give you

197
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:20,770
back the actual result which then you

198
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:22,779
know might get converted incorrectly

199
00:08:22,779 --> 00:08:26,409
even though with web assembly you can do

200
00:08:26,409 --> 00:08:28,120
this in the browser with the correct

201
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:30,909
tool for the job with rust with see with

202
00:08:30,909 --> 00:08:33,219
with languages that have float types

203
00:08:33,219 --> 00:08:37,779
that are more than 32-bit other not so

204
00:08:37,779 --> 00:08:39,310
strong points we've got type coercion

205
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:42,490
side-effects empty string equals equals

206
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:45,220
zero is true it's really hard if you're

207
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:47,260
trying I can like say did they enter a

208
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:49,610
number other than zero

209
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:52,910
oops API overloads so it's this one is

210
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:55,810
new to me actually so if you oneplus

211
00:08:55,810 --> 00:08:57,890
document.getelementbyid II value it

212
00:08:57,890 --> 00:08:59,990
concatenates but if you put number

213
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:02,209
around that it adds it even though

214
00:09:02,209 --> 00:09:04,430
that's not really like a number or it

215
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:06,230
might not be a number it might be an an

216
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:09,279
and then it's 1 plus 9 which is nan

217
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:13,430
probably see I mean like tight coercion

218
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:16,190
can be tricky and then speaking of types

219
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:20,720
the mystery that is type of like that

220
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,970
last one it has infuriated so many

221
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:25,860
people over the years

222
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:28,279
using webassembly means using the right

223
00:09:28,279 --> 00:09:30,019
tool for the job if you've ever seen me

224
00:09:30,019 --> 00:09:31,370
speak before you might have seen me to

225
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:32,899
have a talk about fanaticism and I

226
00:09:32,899 --> 00:09:34,339
talked about using the right tool for

227
00:09:34,339 --> 00:09:37,399
the job and webassembly is using the

228
00:09:37,399 --> 00:09:39,950
right tool for the job on the web we are

229
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:42,380
no longer forced to use JavaScript for

230
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:44,630
things that it is not good at and that

231
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:47,630
is a big deal that is huge for the web

232
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:50,950
that is huge for browser applications

233
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:53,930
but this will kill JavaScript oh we're

234
00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:55,730
gonna have all these applications that

235
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:57,320
are only written and web assembly and

236
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:00,380
it's gonna no just calm down calm down

237
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:01,640
it's not gonna kills us

238
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:04,010
it makes JavaScript better by letting it

239
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:05,870
do what it's good at Dom manipulation

240
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:07,850
react and other frameworks have made Dom

241
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:10,160
manipulation ridiculously fast and GIS

242
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,630
engines have made Dom manipulation

243
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:12,680
ridiculously fast

244
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:14,180
I don't think web assembly is gonna beat

245
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:16,699
JavaScript and Dom manipulation anytime

246
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:19,160
soon it might in the future distant

247
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,750
future but I don't think it's gonna do

248
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:23,060
it anytime soon and it's good at

249
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:25,310
manipulating classes CSS things like

250
00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:26,690
that it's not gonna replace CSS is

251
00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:28,970
either certainly under play CSS so it's

252
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:31,610
a good at augmenting websites that use

253
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:33,380
JavaScript and you will still probably

254
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:35,449
use JavaScript on top of that it's just

255
00:10:35,449 --> 00:10:37,310
letting JavaScript kind of like take a

256
00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:39,589
load off on things that's not so great

257
00:10:39,589 --> 00:10:42,589
at it's like so my fiance and I but if

258
00:10:42,589 --> 00:10:44,480
you don't say hates doing laundry like

259
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,329
with a burning passion and he's bad at

260
00:10:47,329 --> 00:10:50,000
it like a really bad at it and I hate

261
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,240
doing dishes and I'm really bad at it so

262
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:55,610
I do all the laundry and he does all the

263
00:10:55,610 --> 00:10:59,120
dishes everything's fine except right

264
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,829
now because he has to do his own laundry

265
00:11:00,829 --> 00:11:03,320
because I've been gone for three weeks

266
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:08,070
he only has two weeks worth of clothes

267
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:11,240
it makes the web better by creating

268
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:13,370
better browser experiences which is

269
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:16,610
exactly what Ajax did these better

270
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:19,280
browser experiences are mind-blowing

271
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:21,740
when you think of the implications like

272
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:25,760
Jeff Goldblum mind-blowing but let's

273
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,560
take a closer look at what I mean by

274
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:30,620
this with a demo this demo is using Waze

275
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:33,080
image magic if you haven't used image

276
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:35,180
magic before it is a command line and

277
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:38,360
see library that is extremely good at

278
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:41,180
creating and manipulating images it can

279
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:42,770
create animated gifs

280
00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:46,610
don't at me about that pronunciation it

281
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:48,890
can create images of its cell I can

282
00:11:48,890 --> 00:11:51,020
create fractal images it's a very

283
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:53,960
powerful library that I don't want to

284
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,850
rewrite in any language much less

285
00:11:55,850 --> 00:11:58,340
JavaScript we're gonna manipulate images

286
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:00,560
in the browser up to ten times faster

287
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,240
than JavaScript can and in some ways

288
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,280
that JavaScript just can't at least

289
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:06,590
certainly not performing Lee and it's

290
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:07,970
kind of show the real power of not

291
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:09,740
having to rewrite code and being able to

292
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:12,020
let us use the right tool for the job so

293
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:16,070
let's take a look and hope it works

294
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:18,230
because it's worked every other time so

295
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:20,030
it won't work this time you know what I

296
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:23,630
mean okay get my webcam turned on say

297
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:26,440
select an image and I'm gonna go down to

298
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:31,760
Ken oh I always look silly in photos so

299
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,790
like I look silly on my terms

300
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:36,920
okay so these buttons say I'm going to

301
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:38,000
make this a little bigger so you can see

302
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,180
so I guess my tongue and the buttons so

303
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:44,270
we're gonna rotate right and below it

304
00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:45,590
you'll see it's rotated right and that

305
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:48,260
was really really fast rotate left same

306
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:49,730
thing you can do that with CSS really

307
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:51,020
quickly though right like this is not

308
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:52,700
that impressive let's do a grayscale

309
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:54,830
boom grayscale

310
00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:58,880
right no flash let's add some contrast

311
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:02,570
BAM added contrast let's remove some BAM

312
00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:05,030
removed contrast can't chance do that

313
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:10,400
that quickly nope so yeah that's my demo

314
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:13,010
I will tweet out a link to the github

315
00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:15,590
repo this is entirely open source so you

316
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:16,130
are more than wha

317
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:20,920
to play with it yeah so that's my demo

318
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:25,480
yeah thank you but what about nodejs

319
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:29,960
wait but but what about nodejs like this

320
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,370
is a browser thing right like this is

321
00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:33,110
this is just this is a browser

322
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:34,430
technology I just did all that talk

323
00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:36,410
about the browser why am i bringing up

324
00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:39,290
nodejs because this is a note cough I'm

325
00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:40,400
in the wrong spot right that's an

326
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:43,130
Ireland that's also he's gonna smoke up

327
00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:46,610
of you yeah yeah why am i okay the

328
00:13:46,610 --> 00:13:48,530
reason I'm bringing it up is native heck

329
00:13:48,530 --> 00:13:51,850
in modules who has ever seen a C

330
00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:54,380
compilation error when running npm

331
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:56,270
install' most of your hands should be

332
00:13:56,270 --> 00:13:57,620
going up because this has happened to a

333
00:13:57,620 --> 00:14:00,170
lot of people native heck in modules are

334
00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:04,210
a huge pain point in node and they are

335
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:06,710
ridiculous and they make you want to

336
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:10,280
yell what Bryan Cranston is yelling you

337
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:11,690
can probably read his lips on this one

338
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:14,480
because it's like and he's saying blah

339
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,820
obviously he's not saying you know the

340
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:20,570
other word blogger native modules of

341
00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:23,300
Japan they have to be recompiled on

342
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:24,620
download and they have to be recompiled

343
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:27,320
for every single architecture there is

344
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:29,210
that includes the raspberry pi that

345
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:31,190
someone will inevitably file an issue on

346
00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:32,810
your library because it doesn't work on

347
00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:34,460
the Raspberry Pi it wasn't meant to well

348
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:36,500
it didn't well it isn't meant to and

349
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,240
then you have that argument for TOEIC

350
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:41,120
days on github they either have to

351
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,800
compile for your platform or leave left

352
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,480
platforms for support and that can be

353
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,830
kind of tricky again that's the same

354
00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:47,360
github argument or you could just feel

355
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,770
bad does it means heater because like

356
00:14:48,770 --> 00:14:50,810
I'm sorry this doesn't work on Windows

357
00:14:50,810 --> 00:14:53,780
who's been like I'm sorry but this

358
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:56,810
doesn't work on Windows it's not a fun

359
00:14:56,810 --> 00:15:01,070
feeling to say that and no chip

360
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:03,980
disclaimer I respect the heck out of the

361
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:05,810
people who work on no chip like that

362
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:08,270
they have an insert they with Sisyphean

363
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:11,540
task like an insurmountable task so I

364
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:15,010
respect the heck out of them but

365
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:18,050
webassembly works on node anything

366
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:23,780
higher than 8.0 so this is math why why

367
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:25,430
this might matter why does it matter

368
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:29,620
that webassembly works on node 8.0 knob

369
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:33,170
webassembly modules are precompiled for

370
00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:36,920
note j s not for the architecture so

371
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:39,770
they're portable to any platform that

372
00:15:39,770 --> 00:15:43,340
runs node so no more recompilation on

373
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:46,010
download for every architecture yes for

374
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:49,010
reals yes I tried it you can try it too

375
00:15:49,010 --> 00:15:51,520
it's pretty awesome

376
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:54,140
so this quote is from Laurie this

377
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:55,120
morning

378
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,590
everyone wants to deprecate note chip

379
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:59,690
and webassembly would allow us to do

380
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:05,030
this that's huge for know jazz that is

381
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:08,900
and that's the near future note 8 is at

382
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:11,240
the end of life and anything below no 2

383
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,610
8 is not being supported that doesn't

384
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:14,720
mean people don't use it I mean people

385
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:18,290
still use Android like 300 off of water

386
00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:21,190
literally just hit me on the head sorry

387
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:23,240
this confusing thing that's ever

388
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:25,250
happened to me there's an arrow it's

389
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:27,050
actually okay I'm just gonna not stand

390
00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:28,760
there cuz there's water dripping up that

391
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:36,590
spot okay so webassembly is even

392
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:38,930
invading serverless for instance I work

393
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:40,880
at CloudFlare and we have clouds where

394
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,950
workers which run the v8 engine so you

395
00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:44,510
can run webassembly on serverless which

396
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:47,990
is pretty cool we have a free tier now

397
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:50,420
for those of you not in this audience

398
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:52,490
and I mean a hypothetical those of you

399
00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:53,570
like maybe those of you who are watching

400
00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:55,730
this video or a live stream whoever like

401
00:16:55,730 --> 00:16:57,350
but you don't have a free tier and I

402
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:58,820
don't want to pay and I get that don't

403
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:00,140
get me wrong I hate paying for things

404
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:02,900
too if you scan this QR code you can

405
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:04,459
reserve a sub-domain

406
00:17:04,459 --> 00:17:08,120
of workers not dev which it guarantees

407
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:10,100
30 workers and a hundred thousand

408
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:11,449
requests a day which is slightly more

409
00:17:11,449 --> 00:17:14,180
than one a second I did the math without

410
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:18,079
using javascript and I will show this

411
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,699
again later and it is also at our booth

412
00:17:19,699 --> 00:17:21,530
but I will pause for a moment until I

413
00:17:21,530 --> 00:17:24,140
stop seeing cameras plus I'm like

414
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:26,540
running super super early so like I'm

415
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:29,960
just gonna like pause for a second yeah

416
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:32,090
for the QR code obviously not because

417
00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:36,710
I'm like running away anyway all right I

418
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:40,400
see very few cameras out now so the

419
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,130
point of this talk trial of assembly I

420
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:45,620
like rust the more things I learned

421
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:47,060
about rust like what I learned a new

422
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:48,590
thing I keep standing in the spot with

423
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:51,860
the water the more I learn about Russ

424
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:53,300
every new thing I learned I'm like wow I

425
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:55,310
was really well thought out it's like

426
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:58,640
this wasn't created in 13 days no more

427
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,960
I'm not dissing JavaScript it's one of

428
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,430
the best languages ever but it was made

429
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:03,680
in 13 days and rust was definitely not

430
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:06,440
made in 13 days it was definitely well

431
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:08,570
well-thought-out webassembly is the

432
00:18:08,570 --> 00:18:10,850
future of Jay s and all of its forms

433
00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:12,260
though that I hopefully have shown you

434
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:13,970
it's it's going to create better browser

435
00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:16,580
experiences it's going to deprecate no

436
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:19,340
chip don't quote me on that five years

437
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:20,480
from now when it doesn't actually do

438
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,730
that but it could deprecated no chip you

439
00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:24,020
can quote me on that one

440
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:26,450
and the last one is that if you are a

441
00:18:26,450 --> 00:18:28,580
hiring manager watching this right now I

442
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:30,260
would like you to do something very

443
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:31,790
important and that is hire someone

444
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:32,990
different from you they might look

445
00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:34,220
different from you they might believe

446
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:36,230
different things from you they might be

447
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:38,420
different they might have a gender

448
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:40,040
identity different sexuality than you

449
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:42,170
hire them and before you tell me it's

450
00:18:42,170 --> 00:18:44,390
hard I'm gonna refer you to mr. LaBeouf

451
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:48,110
on this just do it it's not that hard

452
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:49,600
just do it

453
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,880
there's higher someone who is different

454
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:58,430
from you somehow anyway thank you for

455
00:18:58,430 --> 00:18:58,820
listening

456
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:04,160
I Laurie I hope you're gonna run over I

457
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,800
tend to be succinct and that's my nice

458
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:07,970
way of saying I tend to run early

459
00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:09,620
there's water dripping everywhere on

460
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:11,450
this stage now by the way Lou so like we

461
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:13,040
might want to look at that we might want

462
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,360
to spend that ten minutes looking at

463
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:18,410
that danced around over here so Carl

464
00:19:18,410 --> 00:19:20,150
Sagan and I both think you're super

465
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:22,670
awesome for watching this talk I can be

466
00:19:22,670 --> 00:19:26,540
found at Kas at CloudFlare comm and also

467
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:28,190
at Noda botanist

468
00:19:28,190 --> 00:19:32,120
I don't grow plants with knowed it was a

469
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:34,370
discussion with like Rick Waldron and

470
00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:35,930
some other folks from Johnny Five we

471
00:19:35,930 --> 00:19:36,950
were trying to figure out what to call

472
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:38,990
people who didn't know BOTS and I was

473
00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:42,290
like two drinks in and I went no

474
00:19:42,290 --> 00:19:46,580
platanus and Rick was like no but that

475
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:48,050
would make a great handle so that's my

476
00:19:48,050 --> 00:19:50,300
handle and then if you search meetup.com

477
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:52,640
for server lists there's a meet-up on

478
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:55,010
Tuesday at Frazier's tower in Singapore

479
00:19:55,010 --> 00:19:56,900
that's where the CloudFlare offices

480
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:59,090
and I will actually be doing a workshop

481
00:19:59,090 --> 00:20:00,530
there where I will teach you how to

482
00:20:00,530 --> 00:20:02,630
write a worker that controls a robot and

483
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:04,040
it's the same robot that's at our booth

484
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:07,010
there currently only I control moi but

485
00:20:07,010 --> 00:20:08,900
you can learn to control it on Tuesday

486
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:10,130
if you happen to be in the Singapore

487
00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:12,980
area still and then the QR code is back

488
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:15,050
up for anybody who missed it on the last

489
00:20:15,050 --> 00:20:15,410
slide

490
00:20:15,410 --> 00:20:17,570
now I'm only 10 minutes early and I'm

491
00:20:17,570 --> 00:20:19,070
feeling much better about that so I'm

492
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:22,680
gonna say thank you very much
