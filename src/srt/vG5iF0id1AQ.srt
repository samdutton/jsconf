my intro to this whole thing and it's

7
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:24,190
been an amazing ride just to see the

8
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:25,420
conference grow and the community grow

9
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:27,820
on the conference super amazing which is

10
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:30,850
why i am super-psyched Chris and I have

11
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:32,290
been working on this for a while and I

12
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:34,180
want to let you guys know that Chris and

13
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:43,190
I are taking can Henderson open source

14
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,149
it's not ready yet but next month on

15
00:00:46,149 --> 00:00:51,239
github the entire genome as a JSON file

16
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:53,860
if you want llamo he's got an issue a

17
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:56,680
full request so thank you can sorry

18
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:59,020
about that we can truncate if you want

19
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:01,510
or at school darn it but no seriously I

20
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:02,950
was actually gonna give a talk about the

21
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:05,710
this tech like I di had that was like a

22
00:01:05,710 --> 00:01:07,660
thing but like I was like well this

23
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:08,950
seems like really really good timing to

24
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:10,330
give a talk about building community

25
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:13,990
this is last call which do you rember

26
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:18,310
the Semisonic song closing time you

27
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:20,020
don't have to go home but you can't stay

28
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:23,860
here so the idea is well if it is

29
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:26,470
closing time let's what do you do in a

30
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:29,080
bar closes you go home and you drink at

31
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:31,420
home hopefully with other people but

32
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:33,310
definitely not in the bar that's closed

33
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:35,860
so I want to talk I want to talk to you

34
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:38,410

49
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:13,090

you a kind of a flavor of that Queens if

55
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:29,310
you don't know Queens it's very

56
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:31,770
interesting because it's kind of a

57
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:33,420
holding pen when your price out of

58
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:34,710
Brooklyn but before you retire to

59
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:37,080
Florida that's you live in queens and

60
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,760

66
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,300
a dead cat in New York without hitting a

67
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:53,490
javascript meetup now it is amazing

68
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:57,000
every week of the year there is a

69
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,860
javascript meetup it is so amazing and

70
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:00,180
it's like just it's an amazing so I want

71
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,920
to tell you the story of these ten

72
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,320
people this is that 10 did I kept that

73
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,870
right off by one no okay I know how what

74
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:08,340
we'd like how we took you know the

75
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:09,960
JavaScript community from like kind of

76
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:13,470
lame to like pretty cool so I'm gonna

77
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:17,220
take it all the way back to 2013 i was

78
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:20,910
living in tokyo i was there was my first

79
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:23,340
tech job and I you know I decided to

80
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:26,550
actually move to Brooklyn and so I was

81
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:27,690
super super psyched you know in Japan

82
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:30,120
Brooklyn is like a huge brand like

83
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,610
there's like bars named Brooklyn and you

84
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:34,290
can go and have a cocktail name type of

85
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:36,390
Brooklyn and then when you're hungover

86
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:37,590
the next day you can have Brooklyn

87
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:41,010
pancakes and then like you'd only have

88
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:42,510
pancakes you know mister donuts and they

89
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:44,850
give you as like swag like Brooklyn jar

90
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:46,250
which is just literally a mason jar

91
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:48,960
called they call it a Brooklyn jar cuz

92
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:51,630
it's more of a Brandon Mason who I

93
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:53,520
actually looked up he has nothing to do

94
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,780
with Brooklyn except he died there

95
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:58,170
that's it this is probably my favorite

96
00:03:58,170 --> 00:03:59,910
they have Brooklyn roasting company is

97
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:01,470
an actual Brooklyn legit Brooklyn

98
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:04,680
roaster in brooklyn on j street an at

99
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,570
brooklyn roasting company in tokyo they

100
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:08,820
sell brooklyn brewery beer which they

101
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:10,110
didn't do it in america so it's like

102
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:12,450
clearly just a brand i scrub stuff i was

103
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:13,530
interesting that i was interested in

104
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:15,840
moving in brooklyn because John Resig

105
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,950
the guy who basically taught me

106
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:18,960
JavaScript lives there he lives in Park

107
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:21,420
Slope this guy Jeremy ashkenaz who like

108
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:22,770
built all the stuff that I was using at

109
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:24,270
the time like backbone and coffee script

110
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:26,490
and underscore he bought that he lives

111
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:27,270
in

112
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:30,629
brooklyn heights this guy Ryan doll you

113
00:04:30,629 --> 00:04:32,729
know 2009 where note came out that was

114
00:04:32,729 --> 00:04:34,500
Ryan doll to give you some perspective

115
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:38,980
here this is after he was John Lennon

116
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:41,490
but before he was sleepy Douglas

117
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:48,000
Crockford kind of in the middle so I get

118
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,409
to Brooklyn and there's a thing because

119
00:04:49,409 --> 00:04:51,990
yes I'm like awesome I'm gonna go meet

120
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:53,550
all these folks at meetups and like it

121
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:56,580
had been defunct a year leader because

122
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:58,080
their final meetup can actually do this

123
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,120
Yazoo min herre their final meetup was a

124
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,220
beer Jess Brian LaRue and that's when

125
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:06,389
the meat offended no don't invite deer

126
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:08,490
meat up so that was kind of faded by the

127
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:09,630
wayside I was like okay let's cast the

128
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:10,560
net a little wider there's got to be

129
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,750
like and my CC no I CJ s actually really

130
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:14,460
good meetup actually went long time ago

131
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:15,690
I met Aaron Quint there that was super

132
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:18,000
awesome and I checked their website and

133
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,080
you look at their last year meetups and

134
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,729
they're all sencha touch meetups which

135
00:05:20,729 --> 00:05:21,900
is like that that's what kind of ass

136
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,940
code smell for a for a meetup if it's

137
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:25,319
like literally one technology so that

138
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:27,479
was kind of not cool basically it was a

139
00:05:27,479 --> 00:05:30,120
total wasteland there was no one okay

140
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,469
maybe Will Smith in his dog but always

141
00:05:31,469 --> 00:05:34,590
no one and so I was like well that's

142
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:36,449
kind of sad that we don't have seen here

143
00:05:36,449 --> 00:05:37,530
oh well I guess they moved you for

144
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:40,169
nothing but then I decided to let go to

145
00:05:40,169 --> 00:05:41,819
some other parts of the world and see

146
00:05:41,819 --> 00:05:43,889
how they did commute me and conferences

147
00:05:43,889 --> 00:05:45,599
and stuff i went to austin by the way

148
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:47,310
this is tilt shift from Apple maps it's

149
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:48,840
amazing that sort of like not an actual

150
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:51,990
photo I went to Austin that was super

151
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:53,969
cool i went to TX JSI met brian j

152
00:05:53,969 --> 00:05:56,479
Brennan who is I will talk about later

153
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:59,069
txt is a super awesome a regional

154
00:05:59,069 --> 00:06:00,360
conference I highly highly highly

155
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,789
recommend it I guess it's now again

156
00:06:02,789 --> 00:06:05,699
maybe the one of the largest in the US

157
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:08,400
now coming in 2016 went here to amelia

158
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,009
island that was super cool because like

159
00:06:11,009 --> 00:06:12,630
there's all you awesome folks and i had

160
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:15,690
a really good time here and then i went

161
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:18,630
to Berlin and then I went to reject jas

162
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:20,130
which is inspired by a conference that's

163
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:23,159
inspired by this one which is kind of

164
00:06:23,159 --> 00:06:24,630
amazing then I went to see us coffee you

165
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:25,949
and that was another conference it was

166
00:06:25,949 --> 00:06:28,949
inspired but kind of inspired by me

167
00:06:28,949 --> 00:06:32,190
jaise conf EU inspired cska vu they kind

168
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:33,810
of run as a pair that was really cool

169
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:35,039
they let me do some cool stuff I gave an

170
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:37,289
entire presentation in CSS about the

171
00:06:37,289 --> 00:06:38,460
Berlin Wall and I use the border

172
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:39,800
collapse that was a

173
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:44,909
it was it's funny in German okay hey I

174
00:06:44,919 --> 00:06:47,770
went to JS conf they let me crowd surf

175
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:50,720
they let me sing songs this one is I

176
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:57,050
sang nice that's nice this is me singing

177
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:59,960
under the sea with many Lauderdale to

178
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:03,620
say an objective-c I'm not going to do

179
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:06,199
it now so don't ask that was super super

180
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:07,699
fun and then I got back to Brooklyn like

181
00:07:07,699 --> 00:07:09,080
wait a minute this is still kind of a

182
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:11,030
wasteland that kind of sucks we should

183
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:12,590
totally change this all of this inspired

184
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:14,870
stuff that I had done for you know over

185
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:16,069
the course of a few months it was super

186
00:07:16,069 --> 00:07:17,030
super awesome and totally wanted to

187
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:18,949
bring that home so I was want to take

188
00:07:18,949 --> 00:07:21,169
jeaious comp and like shrink it down to

189
00:07:21,169 --> 00:07:25,759
8.3 3 333333 percentage size and then

190
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:27,770
like spread it over a year that was kind

191
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:29,240
of like the idea take that vibe and that

192
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,009
was that was my idea behind Brooklyn J

193
00:07:31,009 --> 00:07:33,379
yes and so I ran into this garbage

194
00:07:33,379 --> 00:07:38,780
monster Brian J Brennan future at that

195
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:40,550
point future speaker at JS coffee gave

196
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:43,280
he closed Jeff last year in 2014 with

197
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,449
the talk called being human which is

198
00:07:44,449 --> 00:07:45,529
weird cuz he's not a human he's a

199
00:07:45,529 --> 00:07:49,810
garbage monster he's in a shoegaze band

200
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:52,610
he's super cool shoegaze they call

201
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:54,050
shoegaze because they look at their

202
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:55,490
shoes while they're playing guitar he

203
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:58,310
didn't even see the shoes because he has

204
00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:00,770
so much hair sorry he appreciates craft

205
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:06,440
beer he he appreciates his pictures of

206
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:07,940
him appreciating craft beer that's

207
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:09,319
really cool he also owns one shirt

208
00:08:09,319 --> 00:08:12,830
little secret her yeah so we're like

209
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:14,240
Ryan let's do this let's let's take this

210
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,409
Jess calm flavor which are both familiar

211
00:08:15,409 --> 00:08:16,849
with and let's like shrink it down and

212
00:08:16,849 --> 00:08:18,529
like turn it into like a like a monthly

213
00:08:18,529 --> 00:08:20,900
thing so what do we do of course copy

214
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:24,889
everything Chris Williams does so

215
00:08:24,889 --> 00:08:26,539
weekend so yes basically let's take this

216
00:08:26,539 --> 00:08:28,969
model and you know it's it i mean he's

217
00:08:28,969 --> 00:08:31,430
basically i mean he would you know the

218
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:32,659
two of us did it together was he was

219
00:08:32,659 --> 00:08:34,219
basically the laura williams to my chris

220
00:08:34,219 --> 00:08:35,870
williams except for the fact that i did

221
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:37,159
all the work so he was basically chris

222
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:38,599
way as to my laura wings that's cool

223
00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:39,860
we're not give you know the details

224
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:41,719
there but we went to chris's repo and we

225
00:08:41,719 --> 00:08:44,089
and we copied his logo and we made our

226
00:08:44,089 --> 00:08:45,940
own and like a kind of a subway motif

227
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:48,290
after the j train in the s train neither

228
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:49,940
which i recommend taking we made a

229
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:51,560
website that's kind of like a like a

230
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,030
metro like a subway map

231
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:56,690
we made posters we copy the code of

232
00:08:56,690 --> 00:08:58,310
conduct which is like that's like such a

233
00:08:58,310 --> 00:09:00,530
no-brainer slam dunk now that like you

234
00:09:00,530 --> 00:09:01,760
know if you have JavaScript community

235
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,950
they're probably probably been here and

236
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:05,090
they probably are familiar with it so

237
00:09:05,090 --> 00:09:05,900
that makes everything so much easier

238
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:08,930
it's one less thing to shave a yak on

239
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:10,790
which is really nice or bike shed no no

240
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:12,050
or the same thing I leavin now anyway

241
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:13,880
j/s code of conduct is such a slam dunk

242
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,710
it's basically it's like it's a no

243
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:17,420
smoking sign for your meetup like it's

244
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:19,220
like just it's like it's so easy so I

245
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:21,710
really am so glad that I Chris did that

246
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:23,060
because it makes it easier for the

247
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:24,980
organizers to not just the attendees

248
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:27,410
because you can you don't have all sort

249
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:28,400
of fuzzy think and while you're doing

250
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,840
the event you got a fine line which is

251
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,490
super super nice so we got the code of

252
00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:32,990
conduct we got the logo get the posters

253
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:35,600
we found a really nice venue we totally

254
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,340
lucked out on this it is a super super

255
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:39,800
cool bar they have all sorts of awesome

256
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:42,940
craft beer like set bud light lime

257
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:45,230
that's like local this is actually a map

258
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:47,240
of like a distorted map where Brooklyn

259
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:50,330
zoo JH of basically the mid-atlantic and

260
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:51,680
New England stage super cool it's like a

261
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,630
really awesome vibe you know it's cool

262
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:55,310
because it's like in Japanese magazines

263
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:57,260
that are like all about Brooklyn that

264
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:59,540
was really cool oh cool so we found a

265
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:01,310
venue that was awesome oh yeah rap

266
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:03,370
battle had a rap out with Oakland

267
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:06,020
Oakland is basically the Brooklyn of San

268
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:09,110
Francisco I guess and so I was talking

269
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:11,540
smack to sub stack that was cool yeah

270
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:12,860
and that was it and then we were like so

271
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:15,230
we deal of planning and we said you know

272
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:16,940
we look put tickets on and like it was

273
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:20,600
free awful idea and then lit literally

274
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,310
sold out in like an hour and like you

275
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:23,270
know I had to send an email everyone

276
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:24,470
like hey guys remember the thing was the

277
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:25,370
tickets for free well guess what they're

278
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:27,350
not for you got to pay five dollars and

279
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:28,640
then tickets allowed again I was like ah

280
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:32,450
so anyway it was fine there were five

281
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:33,560
dollars which is such a bargain

282
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:35,750
especially New York City so the idea is

283
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:37,220
this we would do five talks it would

284
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:39,380
just be 5 10 mint lightning talks of

285
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:40,460
course gonna start with John Resig

286
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:42,830
because he likes started it all for me

287
00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:44,690
at least don't start of meet up without

288
00:10:44,690 --> 00:10:46,070
having him speak at your first meetups

289
00:10:46,070 --> 00:10:48,740

talk after that she's super awesome

293
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:56,360
person to have in the committee I can't

294
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,130
imagine the New York scene without her

295
00:10:58,130 --> 00:10:59,720

00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,880

we have really awesome folks in the area

318
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:50,209
as his amigos cook doing stuff a code

319
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:52,279
Lauren we had tiny subversions come down

320
00:11:52,279 --> 00:11:54,529
from Boston this is he makes these

321
00:11:54,529 --> 00:11:55,730
amazing apps this is where we're kind of

322
00:11:55,730 --> 00:11:56,959
leaving JavaScript doing like more like

323
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:58,339
webby stuff kind of broadening a little

324
00:11:58,339 --> 00:11:59,959
bit he does this thing where it like

325
00:11:59,959 --> 00:12:01,549
literally takes definitions from a

326
00:12:01,549 --> 00:12:03,470
dictionary and like girl you must be a

327
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:05,509
blank because definition of thing it's

328
00:12:05,509 --> 00:12:08,749
an amazing go to that website it it's so

329
00:12:08,749 --> 00:12:11,029
good other things we have Bloomberg

330
00:12:11,029 --> 00:12:15,230
sponsor of this conference Bloomberg had

331
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:16,759
this amazing article called what is code

332
00:12:16,759 --> 00:12:17,920
who read this did anyone read this

333
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,970
you're lying you did not read the whole

334
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:22,429
thing it's like 38 thousand words no way

335
00:12:22,429 --> 00:12:24,319
and actually so he came in he gave a

336
00:12:24,319 --> 00:12:26,629
talk about like how the color background

337
00:12:26,629 --> 00:12:28,249
color actually changes the more you

338
00:12:28,249 --> 00:12:29,869
scroll down the more you read so if you

339
00:12:29,869 --> 00:12:31,040
take a screenshot he knows that you

340
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:34,279
didn't read it it's amazing anyway so he

341
00:12:34,279 --> 00:12:35,569
gave a talk about that that was really

342
00:12:35,569 --> 00:12:37,160
really cool that was by the way the

343
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:39,529
best-selling issue of Bloomberg of 2015

344
00:12:39,529 --> 00:12:43,160
so awesome awesome work we had marine

345
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:45,529
have Rebecca come talk about all the

346
00:12:45,529 --> 00:12:47,029
stuff he's doing with whiskey whiskey

347
00:12:47,029 --> 00:12:49,610
whims that was really cool we had oh

348
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:51,919
this guy oh yeah oh yeah Brendan Eich in

349
00:12:51,919 --> 00:12:55,699
my meetup that was really cool who he

350
00:12:55,699 --> 00:12:57,319
had this these are all hot takes this is

351
00:12:57,319 --> 00:12:59,839
amazing this is so true Microsoft is

352
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:01,639
Mozilla right am i right oh it's amazing

353
00:13:01,639 --> 00:13:03,410
so you heard it a Bricklin Jays first

354
00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:05,329
and then so he spent about two and a

355
00:13:05,329 --> 00:13:06,679
song about that and he literally spent

356
00:13:06,679 --> 00:13:08,239
about like ten minutes playing video

357
00:13:08,239 --> 00:13:12,499
games so I'm just saying you're warned

358
00:13:12,499 --> 00:13:13,610
if you would invited her to your meetup

359
00:13:13,610 --> 00:13:15,799
he's going to play video games we had

360
00:13:15,799 --> 00:13:17,389
really cleared these two guys we

361
00:13:17,389 --> 00:13:18,829
actually so we started doing let's do

362
00:13:18,829 --> 00:13:19,880
stuff with other languages

363
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:22,730
go for those of you not familiar with Go

364
00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:25,460
Go is basically the language to which

365
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:27,350
javascript is retire to when they get

366
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:32,180
old it's the Florida of programming

367
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:35,810
languages basically as I'm saying that's

368
00:13:35,810 --> 00:13:39,260
cool we had this guy can't see him

369
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:41,000
because it's so dark that's not neo

370
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,420
that's Martin klebba this is the thing

371
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:45,830
it's a quine it's like running itself to

372
00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:47,380
create the whole thing that blew my mind

373
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:49,970
this is van Newman doing stuff is like

374
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:51,350
we did like we started doing a hardware

375
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:52,670
themed event so here this thing where

376
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:54,080
like he had a camera that filmed all

377
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,310
these random lights in the wall and then

378
00:13:55,310 --> 00:13:56,960
like calibrated it and would like move

379
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,370
his hand like light would change in like

380
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:01,430
Aaron goes yeah the guy who runs the bar

381
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:03,740
that we hold a meetup in actually made a

382
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:05,780
custom popsicle sticks tamper like an

383
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:07,760
automated one so like he we had like

384
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,290
custom popsicles with booze in them that

385
00:14:09,290 --> 00:14:11,510
was super awesome but the best part and

386
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:12,890
probably the best thing we've ever had

387
00:14:12,890 --> 00:14:15,410
was this one this is super mario

388
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:17,630
brothers world 22 if you're familiar

389
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:20,150
with that that's the underwater one you

390
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:23,690
can tell from all the water and so Kris

391
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:26,840
Williams came up from the DC area and

392
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:30,950
what he did is he actually had a instead

393
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:32,570
of a controller he had a bunch of wires

394
00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:35,330
rigged two glasses of beer there was a

395
00:14:35,330 --> 00:14:36,830
beer for left there was a beer for right

396
00:14:36,830 --> 00:14:38,570
and there was a perfect jump and we had

397
00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:40,820
Rachel and Jen sheffer and Mike and what

398
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:42,740
they would have to do is actually drink

399
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:44,690
to get Mario like through this thing

400
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:47,590
right but that's not even the best part

401
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:51,160
the best part is while we were doing it

402
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:53,930
this one was actually playing the Korean

403
00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:56,329
which I was playing the actually

404
00:14:56,329 --> 00:14:59,839
from the board it was it was the most it

405
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:01,790
was like the biggest moment of synergy

406
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:05,019
and like a meetup history was amazing

407
00:15:05,019 --> 00:15:07,549
and then yeah all sorts of cool stuff

408
00:15:07,549 --> 00:15:09,259
started to happen here's Jenna's eigen

409
00:15:09,259 --> 00:15:12,199

410
00:15:12,199 --> 00:15:13,790
then that talk actually got picked up by

00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:15,589
Jace conf use and now she's speaking to

412
00:15:15,589 --> 00:15:17,179

418
00:15:26,629 --> 00:15:29,509

419
00:15:29,509 --> 00:15:32,149

us a thing she made us a thing that was

426
00:15:47,269 --> 00:15:48,619
really really cool we started doing

427
00:15:48,619 --> 00:15:50,239
different kinds of formats because like

428
00:15:50,239 --> 00:15:52,189
CSS cough came into town and scheduled

429
00:15:52,189 --> 00:15:53,389
for the same night his Brooklyn Jas and

430
00:15:53,389 --> 00:15:54,709
I was like what but like let's do

431
00:15:54,709 --> 00:15:56,329
something together so we did we had a

432
00:15:56,329 --> 00:15:58,220
panel gencha fermanagh Amador there's

433
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:00,290
Chris coiour and cloudiness awry and we

434
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:02,329
just did like a chat about you know

435
00:16:02,329 --> 00:16:04,549
various issues it was a it was just a

436
00:16:04,549 --> 00:16:06,079
panel thing it was a new for us but it

437
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:07,459
was amazing and actually what I just

438
00:16:07,459 --> 00:16:09,079
found out the other day this guy mando

439
00:16:09,079 --> 00:16:11,989
Amador speaking at Queen's jas last week

440
00:16:11,989 --> 00:16:14,299
told us that he because of that gig got

441
00:16:14,299 --> 00:16:15,949
a job the CTO of the company that he

442
00:16:15,949 --> 00:16:18,919
works at was at that meet up and so that

443
00:16:18,919 --> 00:16:20,540
was actually really easy for him to just

444
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:22,100
slide into that job so it was like super

445
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:24,169
awesome so yeah we try to get

446
00:16:24,169 --> 00:16:25,369
interesting speakers in in one of the

447
00:16:25,369 --> 00:16:27,230
ways we do it is by the same way very

448
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:28,610
similar to what Jays conf does it's like

449
00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:30,139
a huge basically a pull request it's

450
00:16:30,139 --> 00:16:31,639
basically you just propose it instead of

451
00:16:31,639 --> 00:16:33,049
us curating the talks with the talks

452
00:16:33,049 --> 00:16:35,419
come to us so you just go to gab you

453
00:16:35,419 --> 00:16:36,980
edit two lines and that's it and you're

454
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:39,559
in so then we have you know talks but

455
00:16:39,559 --> 00:16:41,959
you know it cuz not enough so you know

456
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:43,579
after the talks because you know people

457
00:16:43,579 --> 00:16:44,600
can always get tickets so we need to

458
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,769
have like a beer j/s thing afterwards

459
00:16:45,769 --> 00:16:47,809
people can't get tickets but we decided

460
00:16:47,809 --> 00:16:50,239
to innovate here and instead of bjs we

461
00:16:50,239 --> 00:16:53,449
now call it beverages

462
00:16:53,449 --> 00:16:56,629
wow that's that's great Willman Duffy

463
00:16:56,629 --> 00:16:58,129
women Duffy I don't don't follow on

464
00:16:58,129 --> 00:16:59,629
Twitter just look at his thing but don't

465
00:16:59,629 --> 00:17:00,859
click the follow button he's an amazing

466
00:17:00,859 --> 00:17:02,419
amazing guy if you like this by the way

467
00:17:02,419 --> 00:17:04,279
you will love his twitter feed it's all

468
00:17:04,279 --> 00:17:08,209
puns music so yeah that was really cool

469
00:17:08,209 --> 00:17:09,380
and it's funny because it's like better

470
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:10,850
just because well people who don't drink

471
00:17:10,850 --> 00:17:12,169
beer you know one of the organizers are

472
00:17:12,169 --> 00:17:14,480
broken jest doesn't drink beer also like

473
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:19,029
half of Brooklyn is gluten-free so beers

474
00:17:19,029 --> 00:17:24,589
literally literally literally so yeah we

475
00:17:24,589 --> 00:17:26,360
did that so we added the beverages and

476
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:27,829
then what else is going on here up there

477
00:17:27,829 --> 00:17:29,600
were just you know it kind of extends

478
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,760
like we closed the tab at 1am it's it's

479
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,350
fun and there's people just get tickets

480
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:34,760
doesn't matter they'll show up anyway we

481
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:35,659
have a table for him we have some snacks

482
00:17:35,659 --> 00:17:37,070
they can chill out and talk to folks and

483
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:38,149
then when everyone floods out after the

484
00:17:38,149 --> 00:17:40,549
events over it's a super cool thing um

485
00:17:40,549 --> 00:17:42,320
what's going on so now it's you know

486
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,480
it's me and Brian and it's basically

487
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,220
like the me and Brian show and like you

488
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:47,480
know we try to work a little bit of

489
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,190
comedy and here we're explaining how far

490
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:50,960
away Queens is like for people who give

491
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,519
Jersey about being not a borough

492
00:17:52,519 --> 00:17:55,220
like Queens is like super far away so we

493
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:56,090
try to make it a little bit entertaining

494
00:17:56,090 --> 00:17:58,639
so the intro actually is is it kind of

495
00:17:58,639 --> 00:18:00,980
metastasized to this it's like literally

496
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:03,230
for talks worth of time but the audience

497
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:05,990
seems to enjoy it and if you're in the

498
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:08,240
audience you know it's hard to see

499
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:12,620
sometimes but that's cool that's cool

500
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:15,320
this is the sea as the hazard of come to

501
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:17,090
Brooklyn jayus sometimes it reports out

502
00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:19,700
pretty weird but people like it here's a

503
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:22,909
marine have Rebecca saying he just came

504
00:18:22,909 --> 00:18:25,610
like last month any he said this like

505
00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:26,960
super super nice thing because I met him

506
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,990
at berlin's is like way long ago and I

507
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:31,700
was like that's super sweet until I saw

508
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:35,210
the follow-up tweet

509
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:38,380
let's go in whoa thanks for coming to my

510
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:42,310
meetup yeah so we can add I got

511
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:43,840
beverages what else yeah the interest a

512
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,990
lil bit longer fine sign no good school

513
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:51,580
but but yes hey shut your mouth you see

514
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:53,020
all those black lines between the talks

515
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:55,090
that was kind of an issue I don't know

516
00:18:55,090 --> 00:18:57,640
if you've seen this crate recently but

517
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,770
we have the same projector literally

518
00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:01,390
same projector and so between the talks

519
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:04,090
we have these sponsors in like we pay us

520
00:19:04,090 --> 00:19:05,530
money to like have their logo on the

521
00:19:05,530 --> 00:19:06,880
screen and yet viewsonic who pays us

522
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,040
nothing is literally on the screen for

523
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:11,230
like 15 minutes a night so that was like

524
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:12,880
kind of not cool so we wanted to let me

525
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,230
kind of like smooth it over and so we

526
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:16,240
decided to basically take our format and

527
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,890
basically fill in the gaps with music

528
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:19,600
okay so these are 10 minute talks really

529
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,070
fast people talk as fast as I do you

530
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:22,060
need because everyone's trying to

531
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:23,020
squeeze all their ideas in 10 minutes

532
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:24,190
you need something to like decompress

533
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:26,110
between talks and fill that awkward

534
00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:27,910
silence of people setting up so what we

535
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:29,320
started we look to the community to find

536
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:31,480
people who could do music so this guy

537
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:33,580
Vince Allen who presented here I believe

538
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:35,680
recently and he was an EU recently he

539
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:37,420
talking about like a tornado simulation

540
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:41,370

562
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:33,010
had this band come and play is like a

563
00:20:33,010 --> 00:20:36,060
old timey what would you call it the

564
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:38,230
trio thing that was really cool we

565
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:39,670
actually got a guy in the community John

566
00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:41,320
Kay Paul to come in just saying I've

567
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:44,220
been working on a rails app that was fun

568
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:46,660
and then well the thing is we have a

569
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:47,770
house band actually and it's

570
00:20:47,770 --> 00:20:50,380
like barbershop quartet because if I

571
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:52,150
didn't if I didn't bring them to

572
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:53,380
Brooklyn joyous we wouldnt have any gigs

573
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:57,280
so so I was like guys throw move on and

574
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,320
so we are called the four fives but you

575
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:00,790
wouldn't know that because every time we

576
00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:03,750
sing it's the viewsonic logo everywhere

577
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:06,040
so now everyone in New York is

578
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:07,300
conditioned to know that when they see

579
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:09,190
the view sonic logo that I'm going to

580
00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:14,800
sing for them which is not true but yeah

581
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,240
we're the viewsonic quartet and one of

582
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,470
the really cool things about running a

583
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:19,450
meetup in 2015 is you actually get to

584
00:21:19,450 --> 00:21:21,070
engage with brands that or saw that

585
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:26,050
feeling that was super awesome we pay

586
00:21:26,050 --> 00:21:29,350
this venue 61 local awesome bar fifty

587
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:32,110
bucks a day the entire day and we use

588
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:34,240
like literally like two hours upstairs

589
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,040
so what we're like well if we have the

590
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:37,330
thing all day let's actually make an

591
00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:39,100
event and so what we did is we actually

592
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:40,360
decided to instead of just having the

593
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:41,530
evening event we have the evening that

594
00:21:41,530 --> 00:21:43,480
we literally pregame the entire thing

595
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:46,300
from 10 am-10 a.m. on with programming

596
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:48,550
do you guys programm programm programm

597
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:52,260
yeah so we are all programming all day

598
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:55,480
in the borough of Brooklyn we're trying

599
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:59,550
to reclaim programming it's like a right

600
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:02,680
take off the edge this is bro gramming

601
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,900
and so yeah it's cool so here's the

602
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:06,070
actual bar downstairs you come in

603
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:07,480
through this door you know the sign that

604
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:08,980
tells you where it is you come up this

605
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:10,780
venues empty anyway let's fill it with

606
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:12,550
tables let's fill the tables of people

607
00:22:12,550 --> 00:22:14,200
and let's just hang out you know they

608
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,000
have fios internet which is super cool

609
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,280
cuz that for America is really fast for

610
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:21,010
those of you out of town the best thing

611
00:22:21,010 --> 00:22:22,780
about the speed test thing is that it

612
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:24,190
literally literally looks like this news

613
00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:29,820
pissing on New Jersey

614
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:40,570
I don't blame him but we have food they

615
00:22:40,570 --> 00:22:42,130
said like this this venue 61 local has

616
00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:44,799
this amazing kitchen and so they started

617
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:46,690
just doing catering for us and so they

618
00:22:46,690 --> 00:22:48,010
have a triple kale salad because you

619
00:22:48,010 --> 00:22:50,049
can't have enough kale in Brooklyn with

620
00:22:50,049 --> 00:22:51,340
roasted veggies and like awesome fruits

621
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:53,140
and like meats and stuff and you know we

622
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:54,940
hang out we work and we chat and we and

623
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:57,669
we danced and you know at 5pm go down to

624
00:22:57,669 --> 00:23:01,240
the bar for beverages and then you know

625
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:02,350
we start actually developing a

626
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:03,639
relationship with this venue where they

627
00:23:03,639 --> 00:23:05,049
actually start catering to us they

628
00:23:05,049 --> 00:23:06,399
actually started making a menu for us

629
00:23:06,399 --> 00:23:08,169
because we have so many people there in

630
00:23:08,169 --> 00:23:09,399
such a short time that they need

631
00:23:09,399 --> 00:23:11,200
actually food that turns around fast so

632
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,340
they make our own menu for us they

633
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:14,019
reserve a table for us they are super

634
00:23:14,019 --> 00:23:15,220
super awesome so my recommendation

635
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:17,710
you're doing me to find a home getting

636
00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:19,510
that out of your brain and not having to

637
00:23:19,510 --> 00:23:21,010
worry about you know having a meetup in

638
00:23:21,010 --> 00:23:22,029
a start-up we're like they're not

639
00:23:22,029 --> 00:23:23,409
recruiting this month so like get out of

640
00:23:23,409 --> 00:23:24,639
here or like you know they go to

641
00:23:24,639 --> 00:23:26,679
business or get out of here like not

642
00:23:26,679 --> 00:23:28,539
dealing with that 60mm local is happy to

643
00:23:28,539 --> 00:23:31,090
have us because we bring people with

644
00:23:31,090 --> 00:23:34,120
money who are not bankers right because

645
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:35,649
in New York the people with money or the

646
00:23:35,649 --> 00:23:40,480
bankers there so in San Francisco the

647
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,370
tech people are the douchebags in New

648
00:23:42,370 --> 00:23:44,350
York right finance or the douchebags so

649
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:47,039
like we're like Thoratec it's awesome so

650
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:49,179
thank you Tom Dale for teaching me that

651
00:23:49,179 --> 00:23:52,090
I didn't realize that I was amazing yeah

652
00:23:52,090 --> 00:23:53,860
and so what we'd so would like ok cool

653
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:55,000
so now I have this meetup for charging

654
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,279
money where's his money going to go we

655
00:23:57,279 --> 00:23:58,899
decided we there's an organization

656
00:23:58,899 --> 00:24:00,490
called scripted and what they do is they

657
00:24:00,490 --> 00:24:01,510
go into schools and they bring

658
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:03,940
volunteers to teach web skills and they

659
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:05,830
actually help place those kids into

660
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:06,940
internships in New York and companies

661
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:09,039
super super super awesome so we're like

662
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:11,169
well how can we actually we're charging

663
00:24:11,169 --> 00:24:12,130
money we're giving it to them but how

664
00:24:12,130 --> 00:24:13,000
can I actually take you to the next

665
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,590
level what we started doing is instead

666
00:24:14,590 --> 00:24:16,090
of getting people tickets so that you

667
00:24:16,090 --> 00:24:17,740
buy a ticket and you get a beer so like

668
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:19,059
check your ticket and give a beer that's

669
00:24:19,059 --> 00:24:20,440
it we're like well what if we actually

670
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:23,019
spent more money to actually make custom

671
00:24:23,019 --> 00:24:25,659
3d printed tokens custom for each event

672
00:24:25,659 --> 00:24:27,940
and then give those out like it's going

673
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:29,080
to cost us two hundred dollar more these

674
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:30,610
things I got like a dollar piece it

675
00:24:30,610 --> 00:24:32,169
costs us more money but it actually

676
00:24:32,169 --> 00:24:34,240
makes the bar tab go down which is

677
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,620
really really cool and it's also it's a

678
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:36,850
keepsake that you actually get to keep

679
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:38,500
so we actually it's almost like Google

680
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:40,750
Analytics here but you can actually see

681
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:42,850
how many tokens each month are being

682
00:24:42,850 --> 00:24:44,110
redeemed and you actually see like how

683
00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:46,690
successful you are and actually getting

684
00:24:46,690 --> 00:24:48,940
people to to hold on to them we want

685
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:50,440
them to hold on to the token instead of

686
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:52,030
paying for a beer a beer in Brooklyn at

687
00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:53,740
this place is like eight bucks so if

688
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:55,180
they can hold on token that's like money

689
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:56,410
that we say which is super awesome but

690
00:24:56,410 --> 00:24:57,550
what happens is we end up with all these

691
00:24:57,550 --> 00:25:00,250
tokens I don't need so this is actually

692
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:03,910
a cruel thing I actually decided to up

693
00:25:03,910 --> 00:25:06,100
source up upcycled these things into an

694
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:08,020
actual thing what we did is I got

695
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:10,480
together with my fellow organizers and

696
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:13,240
we made plaques at some brooklyn brewery

697
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:16,390
beer as one does and we took all the

698
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:18,130
tokens after our token run ended and we

699
00:25:18,130 --> 00:25:19,930
made a plaque theme and we went we sold

700
00:25:19,930 --> 00:25:21,820
the plaque so take all the unwanted

701
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:23,500
tokens put them in plex sell the plaques

702
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:25,810
back to people to make more money for

703
00:25:25,810 --> 00:25:27,430
scripted right so the idea is now that

704
00:25:27,430 --> 00:25:28,420
you have a place where the money goes

705
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:29,770
and they're doing awesome stuff you want

706
00:25:29,770 --> 00:25:30,490
to give them as much money as possible

707
00:25:30,490 --> 00:25:32,170
you start looking for opportunities to

708
00:25:32,170 --> 00:25:33,520
actually like tweak the algorithm to

709
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,260
actually send them more money so you

710
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:36,370
know and we change things as another

711
00:25:36,370 --> 00:25:38,140
learning opportunity we don't do tokens

712
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:40,480
anymore we do wouldn't Metro cards which

713
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:43,540
is just the most precious thing ever and

714
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:44,500
that was actually a really good

715
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:46,570
opportunity to learn how to use laser

716
00:25:46,570 --> 00:25:49,110
etcher laser cutter which is super nice

717
00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:52,930
it doesn't always work this is I'm sure

718
00:25:52,930 --> 00:25:54,910
you work with I work with bits and bytes

719
00:25:54,910 --> 00:25:56,140
and work with but like it don't always

720
00:25:56,140 --> 00:26:00,700
work out yep oh hey whoa oh well there

721
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:02,560
it is so yeah that was no learning

722
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:04,480
experience but through all this stuff

723
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,880
through all the stuff that we did uh to

724
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,710
send money by you know getting basically

725
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:11,020
our event is a black box that takes

726
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:12,610
developer intention and turns it into

727
00:26:12,610 --> 00:26:16,000
money for new developers cynically but

728
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,320
that's basically what we do and over the

729
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:18,550
course of our existence we've been able

730
00:26:18,550 --> 00:26:20,050
to raise this much money for scripted

731
00:26:20,050 --> 00:26:22,510
yeah they're an amazing organization

732
00:26:22,510 --> 00:26:25,030
they're super cool and because we're

733
00:26:25,030 --> 00:26:26,110
tweaking this algorithm are actually

734
00:26:26,110 --> 00:26:27,460
trying to find ways to send them more

735
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:29,440
money by actually getting people to not

736
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:32,860
drink beer it's really cool so basically

737
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:35,350
our bar tab as you know you'll see it go

738
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:36,790
up as even gets more popular but then

739
00:26:36,790 --> 00:26:38,410
actually in the past few months the bar

740
00:26:38,410 --> 00:26:39,850
tab has gone way down and for the first

741
00:26:39,850 --> 00:26:42,880
time last week went down to ninety

742
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,650
dollars that's literally like of the

743
00:26:44,650 --> 00:26:46,480
swag that we make like everyone is

744
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,040
keeping it no one is redeeming it for a

745
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:50,290
beer so that's like a total success so

746
00:26:50,290 --> 00:26:51,310
that's a really cool thing we did if you

747
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:53,230
want to see our finances it's all in one

748
00:26:53,230 --> 00:26:54,640
gigantic javascript Express

749
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:59,470
as one does our entire budget is one

750
00:26:59,470 --> 00:27:02,790
giant JavaScript expansion that exits I

751
00:27:02,790 --> 00:27:04,990
hopefully an integer probably not it'll

752
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:06,400
coerce don't worry about its JavaScript

753
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:10,420
but if you end up with any money like

754
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:12,460
basically travesty I yells at you

755
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:13,690
because you exited with a code that's

756
00:27:13,690 --> 00:27:16,030
not zero does that make sense and so

757
00:27:16,030 --> 00:27:17,350
that's how we do our budget it's like so

758
00:27:17,350 --> 00:27:18,760
just like you know if I'm embezzling

759
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:20,170
money like Travis is going to snitch on

760
00:27:20,170 --> 00:27:21,610
me so that's how that's how we figure

761
00:27:21,610 --> 00:27:23,260
that out and we're starting to if you

762
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:24,340
guys want to support the cause we

763
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:25,480
actually have a few of these left over I

764
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:27,940
believe we made sucks check it out socks

765
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:30,040
and you can buy them if you go to

766
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,240
Brooklyn jest are you wearing your socks

767
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:34,450
is wearing the socks oh yes Oh excellent

768
00:27:34,450 --> 00:27:38,290
thank you they look great on Bo as they

769
00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:40,120
look great on Tom Dale if you're one of

770
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:42,760
those people awesome but no we have

771
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:43,690
talked in so they come with a free

772
00:27:43,690 --> 00:27:44,740
ticket so that's a really cool because

773
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:46,240
tickets go really fast tickets for our

774
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:48,070
last event with Brendan Eich went in two

775
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:49,630
rounds the first one was 28 seconds in

776
00:27:49,630 --> 00:27:50,770
the second round was seven seconds and

777
00:27:50,770 --> 00:27:52,630
that's 100 tickets so tickets sometimes

778
00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:53,680
based on the speakers are super super

779
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:55,870
hard to get so by a tying it to the well

780
00:27:55,870 --> 00:27:57,100
you can get a ticket now be get to spend

781
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:58,060
more money in that money goes to

782
00:27:58,060 --> 00:28:00,160
scripted total win-win so find the wind

783
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:02,680
winds that has been awesome so that's

784
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,000
basically what we did and then Brian and

785
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,000
I we grew the family so we should and so

786
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,800
now we have a marie cocco soccer right

787
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:12,570

00:28:21,430 --> 00:28:24,760
organizer and smc uh so it's my last

792
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:29,350

793
00:28:29,350 --> 00:28:31,270
the the meetup is an amazing capable

794
00:28:31,270 --> 00:28:32,890
hands and I'm sure you won't have seen

795
00:28:32,890 --> 00:28:36,550
the last of me but but yeah not only did

796
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:37,810
we grow the Brooklyn Jas family but we

797
00:28:37,810 --> 00:28:40,240
grew the other family the bore ojs

798
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:41,620
family we basically now have siblings

799
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:43,510
and this is basically what i want to say

800
00:28:43,510 --> 00:28:45,100
this is like the best part of this whole

801
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:47,200
thing is we created this community you

802
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,640
know we tweaked some knobs to get things

803
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,530
to work and then it just created this

804
00:28:50,530 --> 00:28:51,760
environment where people can like

805
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:54,130
interact and meet and like get jobs and

806
00:28:54,130 --> 00:28:55,840
like hang out and like there has been

807
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:58,600
such demand for this I don't know why it

808
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:00,370
wasn't the thing even when I showed up

809
00:29:00,370 --> 00:29:02,710
but we made the thing and so now it's a

810
00:29:02,710 --> 00:29:04,270
thing until like now there are you know

811
00:29:04,270 --> 00:29:06,700
every week there is a meet-up so tell

812
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:07,539
you a little about a few

813
00:29:07,539 --> 00:29:08,619
they have different like we're all doing

814
00:29:08,619 --> 00:29:09,580
a difference if llings like siblings

815
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:12,190
have different personalities Manhattan

816
00:29:12,190 --> 00:29:14,799

817
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:17,649

prayers on the mic they do different

822
00:29:25,239 --> 00:29:26,649
thing instead of doing music between cuz

823
00:29:26,649 --> 00:29:28,509
like the filling is a good idea but you

824
00:29:28,509 --> 00:29:31,570
know music is maybe not their thing they

825
00:29:31,570 --> 00:29:33,220
do battle decks which is like power

826
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:35,499
karaoke PowerPoint so like they'll just

827
00:29:35,499 --> 00:29:37,389
do like have Zara will choose random

828
00:29:37,389 --> 00:29:38,710
slides and like some people have just

829
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:39,669
riff as if they're giving a presentation

830
00:29:39,669 --> 00:29:41,679
that's like super super fun crowd loves

831
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:43,989
it and instead of doing ten minute talks

832
00:29:43,989 --> 00:29:45,249
five of them they do 20 minute talks

833
00:29:45,249 --> 00:29:47,049
three of them so you can actually have

834
00:29:47,049 --> 00:29:48,669
like a real talk Brooklyn say has a 10

835
00:29:48,669 --> 00:29:50,289
