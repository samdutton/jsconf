[Music]

2
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:12,570
I'm excited to be back it's my second

3
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:16,080
year at CSS calm and welcome to my talk

4
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:19,920
why do we call HTML tags tags I'm Andres

5
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,830
Cuervo and before we get started I want

6
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:24,000
to tell you a little bit about a little

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,300
bit about myself I'm an XOR artist a

8
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:29,689
software engineer and an HCI researcher

9
00:00:29,689 --> 00:00:31,859
so that means that I spend most of my

10
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:35,360
time building web-based VR and AR

11
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,489
experiences demos artworks stuff like

12
00:00:38,489 --> 00:00:40,920
that but I also really like nerding out

13
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:44,190
about the history of HTML and CSS and so

14
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:46,399
that's what this talk is gonna be about

15
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:52,110
so before we answer the question that's

16
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:54,239
the name of this talk even though I'm

17
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:56,460
sure this audience being says CSS comp

18
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:58,770
is already familiar it's always good to

19
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:02,550
be really explicit so we'll talk about

20
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:04,680
talk a little bit about what tags with

21
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,119
the dad the tags that we're talking

22
00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:09,720
about are so if we view the source of

23
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:13,920
any web page you'll see a giant HTML

24
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,590
document and it'll have two two types of

25
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:19,080
things the first will be the doctype and

26
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,790
that tells you what version of HTML

27
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:23,040
you're looking at and the rest of the

28
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,560
document will be composed of tags so if

29
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,960
we take for example the title the

30
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:30,869
content of the content of the tag is

31
00:01:30,869 --> 00:01:33,720
example domain and that's what appears

32
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:36,659
in your browser tab in your browser tab

33
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:39,150
is the name but the tags themselves are

34
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:43,950
pieces of XML that are surrounded by by

35
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:46,850
greater than and less than symbols and

36
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:49,530
yeah so this is what I mean when I'm

37
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:51,810
referring to a tag and everyone who

38
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:54,420
works on the web has to know this and

39
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:56,939
works it works with this very intimately

40
00:01:56,939 --> 00:01:58,799
and

41
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:01,799
a few months back I was thinking about

42
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:04,950
why we call these things tags though

43
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:08,580
only two sort of example or only two

44
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:10,560
like definitions for the word tag that I

45
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,390
can think of outside of this are the

46
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:13,950
tags like the things that come on your

47
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:17,610
clothing and tags are tagged like the

48
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:18,930
children's game where kids run around

49
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:21,569
and tap each other and neither of those

50
00:02:21,569 --> 00:02:24,060
seem like obviously related to what

51
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:26,040
we're talking about here

52
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:29,370
and after some googling I couldn't

53
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:31,440
really find a simple answer and that's

54
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,890
what led to the development of this talk

55
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:37,319
so in order to answer where that word

56
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:39,569
where this word comes from we have to

57
00:02:39,569 --> 00:02:41,190
take a short trip through the history of

58
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:47,010
HTML and the so the first document to

59
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:49,769
actually standardize HTML was published

60
00:02:49,769 --> 00:02:52,410
by Tim berners-lee in November of 1995

61
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:54,360
and it was called hypertext markup

62
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:57,299
language 2.0 and that's because HTML

63
00:02:57,299 --> 00:02:58,950
itself had already been around since

64
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:02,640
around 1990 and in it there's one

65
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,989
particular line that's pretty

66
00:03:03,989 --> 00:03:06,480
interesting to us which is HTML

67
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,820
documents our sgml documents with

68
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:10,320
generic semantics that are appropriate

69
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,030
for representing information from a wide

70
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:13,890
range of domains and that's just a

71
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:16,709
long-winded way of saying that hTML is

72
00:03:16,709 --> 00:03:18,000
good at representing a bunch of

73
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,100
different information types so at this

74
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:23,100
time there were only 18 HTML tags but

75
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:25,019
even with that limited set people were

76
00:03:25,019 --> 00:03:26,430
able to express a bunch of different

77
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:28,769
document types and that would only grow

78
00:03:28,769 --> 00:03:30,299
with the later introduction of more tags

79
00:03:30,299 --> 00:03:34,470
and CSS but for our purposes this is

80
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:35,940
interesting because it mentions that

81
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:39,859
hTML started off as an sgml document and

82
00:03:39,859 --> 00:03:42,810
so that needs to the limit that the next

83
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:45,650
natural question which is what is sgml

84
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:48,810
so it stands for standard generalized

85
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:52,470
markup language and it preceded HTML

86
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:56,010
being standardized in 1986 and it

87
00:03:56,010 --> 00:03:58,290
contains it's it's actually not a markup

88
00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:01,150
language itself but rather it's a meta

89
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:03,540
Markham it's it's it's meant to define

90
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:06,489
the medicine tax for markup languages

91
00:04:06,489 --> 00:04:08,440
that hope to be general themselves and

92
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:12,970
so it contains to in in that mission to

93
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:14,920
stay really broad it only contains two

94
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:17,079
types of things the first are called

95
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:20,199
type valid in the document and these are

96
00:04:20,199 --> 00:04:23,020
things that with that this is a tag at

97
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:24,430
the top of the document that tells you

98
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:25,990
what type of document you're looking at

99
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:29,020
and this sounds really familiar because

100
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:31,120
it's the doctype that we saw at the

101
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:35,080
beginning in our example HTML file and

102
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:38,290
then everything else in sgml is known as

103
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:40,780
tag valid where all of the content in

104
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:43,320
the document is surrounded by an XML tag

105
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:46,240
and those are the two sorts of things

106
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,840
and this sounds really familiar because

107
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,610
this is what the first version of HTML

108
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:54,100
was SPECT against but this doesn't

109
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:56,440
really answer our question because there

110
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,630
is something that even precedes sgml

111
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:00,699
which is GML and both of them were

112
00:05:00,699 --> 00:05:03,220
created by this person Charles Goldfarb

113
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:07,510
at IBM and he talks as early he talks

114
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:10,930
about talking about tags as early as

115
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:14,320
1969 as in the this like sentence

116
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,389
fragment where he talks about quote

117
00:05:16,389 --> 00:05:18,820
using an unfilled in outline of tags as

118
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:20,530
a prompter from which to create a new

119
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:24,669
document and so this is where we sort of

120
00:05:24,669 --> 00:05:28,210
first see the word tag resemble resemble

121
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:29,710
a thing that we would look we would look

122
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:32,020
at in HTML and recognize which is as a

123
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:34,419
container for data and if we were to

124
00:05:34,419 --> 00:05:37,419
stop here this is what the chain would

125
00:05:37,419 --> 00:05:40,389
look like and that's pretty short but we

126
00:05:40,389 --> 00:05:42,370
can we can go further down the rabbit

127
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:45,370
hole and ask where did the tag the rid

128
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:47,910
of the usage of tag in 1969 come from

129
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:51,130
and this was easy when we were asking it

130
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:53,500
about HTML because there's a document

131
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:56,250
that tells us it's it's an sgml thing

132
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:59,169
but so far as I could find there was no

133
00:05:59,169 --> 00:06:00,820
there was really no reference to where

134
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:02,789
the word tag came from in

135
00:06:02,789 --> 00:06:05,970
in the original versions of GML and XML

136
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:07,349
which were developed alongside each

137
00:06:07,349 --> 00:06:09,900
other and so in order to get at this

138
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:13,289
question I took I borrowed a page from

139
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:15,750
the field called etymology so let's talk

140
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,580
about that for a second

141
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:20,310
etymology is defined as the study of the

142
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:22,169
origin of words and the way in which

143
00:06:22,169 --> 00:06:23,490
their meanings have changed their

144
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:26,610
history and so typically etymology is

145
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:30,090
used to study words through hundreds of

146
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:31,889
years or thousands of years of change

147
00:06:31,889 --> 00:06:34,590
and so if we take the word cascade as in

148
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:37,289
cascading stylesheets then we can see

149
00:06:37,289 --> 00:06:39,629
that it comes to English from this long

150
00:06:39,629 --> 00:06:44,039
series of French Italian and Latin for

151
00:06:44,039 --> 00:06:46,319
to fall and that makes sense because the

152
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:48,509
definitions are pretty related and that

153
00:06:48,509 --> 00:06:50,580
it's actually pretty old word in English

154
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:52,590
coming in sometime in the mid s'en in

155
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:56,190
mid 17th century and so while this is a

156
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:58,830
much more involved process we can take a

157
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:01,229
cue from what etymologists and linguists

158
00:07:01,229 --> 00:07:03,779
do here by trying to find the earliest

159
00:07:03,779 --> 00:07:06,199
instance of the word tag in computing

160
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:11,430
and so in in trying to research this

161
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:13,529
question the earliest instance that I

162
00:07:13,529 --> 00:07:16,800
can find it was credited to this person

163
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:21,479
emile leon post and post was a computer

164
00:07:21,479 --> 00:07:24,560
scientist a or he was a mathematician

165
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:28,139
but he made sort of fundamental inroads

166
00:07:28,139 --> 00:07:30,810
in theoretical computer science he was a

167
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:34,139
contemporary of Alan Turing's and he was

168
00:07:34,139 --> 00:07:37,949
a logician and a mathematician so he

169
00:07:37,949 --> 00:07:40,830
introduced this idea of a tag system in

170
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:44,550
a paper in 1943 called formal reductions

171
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:46,110
of the general combinatorial decision

172
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:47,729
problem and while we won't go through

173
00:07:47,729 --> 00:07:49,860
the whole paper it's useful to

174
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:52,620
understand what it's doing in order to

175
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:54,659
understand why why the why the word tag

176
00:07:54,659 --> 00:07:57,629
is appropriate here so the paper itself

177
00:07:57,629 --> 00:07:59,940
is describing a computational model for

178
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:02,759
producing words arbitrary words from

179
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:04,620
production rules and that sounds really

180
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:07,500
abstract and hand-wavy so here is a very

181
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:10,080
very minified example

182
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,720
if we have a if we have a very simple

183
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,729
alphabet that only has four letters in

184
00:08:14,729 --> 00:08:19,349
it ABC and H and we we say that whenever

185
00:08:19,349 --> 00:08:21,840
we see an A we add on this string si si

186
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,479
bah and whenever we see a B we add on

187
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:28,139
CCA and so on with Si and si si then we

188
00:08:28,139 --> 00:08:30,270
can take any initial word and start

189
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:33,209
transforming it so if we start with baa

190
00:08:33,209 --> 00:08:35,490
then we take a look at that first letter

191
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:38,550
and we see that B goes to C CA and so we

192
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:41,159
tack that on and then there is a formula

193
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:43,019
for every time we pick a production rule

194
00:08:43,019 --> 00:08:45,810
we truncate the front of the string with

195
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:47,820
some amount of letters or by some amount

196
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:49,290
of letters and that changes throughout

197
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:51,149
the string but the one fundamental thing

198
00:08:51,149 --> 00:08:53,459
is that you keep tacking on the end of

199
00:08:53,459 --> 00:08:55,740
to the end of the string that preceded

200
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:58,560
it until you finally hit a letter that

201
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,149
you can no longer produce a production

202
00:09:00,149 --> 00:09:02,660
rule for or you reach a chain that you

203
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:05,220
that is so small but you can't delete

204
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:10,200
anything from it and so yeah if we look

205
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,149
at this sequence not only does this look

206
00:09:12,149 --> 00:09:14,339
like a little stack but it looks like

207
00:09:14,339 --> 00:09:17,160
the ends of each each successive word

208
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:19,980
are sort of chasing each other and in

209
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:21,930
fact there is a footnote from that

210
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:24,060
original paper footnote 12 if you're

211
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:28,170
curious where post-credits this person

212
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:33,390
BP gill with with noting that the that

213
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:34,770
the axioms look like they're chasing

214
00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:37,110
each other and so he gave he suggested

215
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:39,720
the name tag and so in fact in this

216
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:42,390
usage we post would have called this a

217
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:45,570
tag operation and while this usage is

218
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:48,260
slightly different it's it's probably

219
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:53,600
fair to say that one Emil posts work was

220
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,370
really well received during his time and

221
00:09:56,370 --> 00:09:58,350
too it was it would go on to influence

222
00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:01,680
language designers in the next in the

223
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:05,160
preceding decades and so yeah there's

224
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:09,170
there's sort of two possibilities one is

225
00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:11,530
that the word tag comes from the common

226
00:10:11,530 --> 00:10:14,420
the common word for like a tattoo tag a

227
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:17,860
piece of clothing but this introduced

228
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:21,380
find like finding this evidence seems to

229
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:23,360
point to the children's game of tag

230
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,990
influencing BP guilt and so this is the

231
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:29,540
final chain of etymology that I came up

232
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:32,600
with for where we get the word tag in

233
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:36,050
HTML and the word for the children's

234
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:37,580
game actually comes as far back as the

235
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:41,360
1700s and so that led BP Gill to suggest

236
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,820
to post to use the word tag for his

237
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:47,020
seminal paper and that I'm speculating

238
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:49,640
sort of made its way into the lexicon of

239
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:51,560
computer scientists where someone at IBM

240
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:55,160
would later create GML and sgml and that

241
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:57,320
would go on to influence the very first

242
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:03,530
specs of HTML and so yeah this is I I

243
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:05,750
hope that this talk sort of does two

244
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:07,040
things for you

245
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,560
one that interests you in item ology a

246
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:11,330
little bit because I think it's really

247
00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:15,740
cool and that too I hope that it sort of

248
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:18,260
encourages you to take a look at the at

249
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:19,580
the history of things that you might

250
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:21,250
have overlooked or seen as mundane

251
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:24,110
because if you whether it's in your

252
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:25,520
worker in your personal life there are

253
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,080
probably a million things around you

254
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:29,930
that you don't realize have probably

255
00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:31,070
surprising and pretty interesting

256
00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:36,640
histories yeah and that's all I have

257
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:40,160
[Applause]

258
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,020
you

259
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:41,850
[Applause]
