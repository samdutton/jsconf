1
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:15,800
all right I'm just gonna get straight to
it so when you assume you make an error

2
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:21,560
out of you and me I thought this was a
really catchy top title you know it's a

3
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:26,840
play on words on a play on words about
the pitfalls of assumptions which is

4
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:32,570
what I wanted to talk about how we can
communicate wrongly when we assume so

5
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:37,130
it's a great title right Rico but it
turns out that it's actually really not

6
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:42,260
it's a really bad title because what
I've done is I've assumed that everybody

7
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:48,500
listening to me speak and reading this
title is one familiar with English to a

8
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:53,680
high degree we're talking first language
levels here and too familiar with

9
00:00:53,680 --> 00:01:00,770
informal English phrases such as when
you assume you make an ass out of you

10
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:06,590
and me this is the phrase guys in case
you didn't know it but I'm really sorry

11
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:13,909
I assumed that you knew so let's just
move on from that unfortunately there is

12
00:01:13,909 --> 00:01:18,560
a positive twist to this because it's a
great example of what I'm here to ask

13
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:24,920
you to try and be aware of so let's
agree that anything I say from here on

14
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:31,030
out can and most definitely will be
applied to myself there's a small caveat

15
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:36,350
there these little asterisks that will
show up when there is a flashing visual

16
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:43,010
on the following slide just as a trigger
warning so I'm Gabby I work at the

17
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:47,690
Financial Times we are the world's
leading news organization and Business

18
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:52,190
and Economic Affairs I've been there for
a couple of years now and I've been very

19
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:56,540
lucky to work in a company that values
its culture very strongly because it

20
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:59,210
means that the people that work there
care about the people that work there

21
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:05,180
and it's a great environment to learn
and develop in so I work specifically on

22
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:10,670
a team called origami we are the FTS
component library and essentially our

23
00:02:10,670 --> 00:02:16,040
work is geared at simplifying other
people's work and we try to be as

24
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:19,410
accessible as possible in every sense of
the word because our

25
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:24,940
users are developers but developers from
various different backgrounds developing

26
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:30,100
various different ft products for
various different ft customers so that

27
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:34,630
means that we need to make our
components as clear as possible in their

28
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:39,910
functionality and their documentation
one of the ways in which we do this is

29
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:44,530
by maintaining a public registry
it houses information on all of the

30
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:51,070
components that we own and develop and
it provides demos to assist others in

31
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:58,420
their implementation earlier this year
we rewrote and redesigned this registry

32
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:02,770
you want to make it fast and sleek and
cool to use and stuff and on the day

33
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:08,320
that we launched it we got a cake to
celebrate with our users unfortunately I

34
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:12,340
didn't get a picture of the cake when it
was whole because it was a good cake but

35
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:16,870
I figured I would use that opportunity
to get some feedback from our users on

36
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:24,070
our registry and I wrote on the cake box
right so I wrote for cake slice please

37
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:27,760
to leave nice feedback on post-it note
and I thought I was being really

38
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:34,570
charming and like I'd got my point
across and we got feedback but all of

39
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:37,769
our feedback was on the cake

40
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:50,159
so it's amusing to see people compliment
cake for sure they get creative but

41
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:58,709
because I made an assumption about what
people knew I didn't get the feedback

42
00:03:58,709 --> 00:04:03,260
that I had asked for it so we have been
working on the registry for a while and

43
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:07,049
because of that we knew why there was
cake everybody else just saw you know

44
00:04:07,049 --> 00:04:13,920
delicious chocolatey and free cake and
that really complicates things for us

45
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:21,060
because what I really want to highlight
is that it's very easy to forget that we

46
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:25,740
don't know what others know and that
others don't know what we know and at

47
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:29,070
one point or another we all make
assumptions that we believe to be an

48
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:34,080
offensive and because of what we don't
know these assumptions can be harmful to

49
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:39,470
our interactions so I'm going to talk
about a few aspects of our industry

50
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:46,880
where we may frequently make assumptions
starting with error message it's mm-hmm

51
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:52,200
so I'll venture it guess that nobody
really wants to see error messages but

52
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:57,450
at one point or another we all need them
and we may even secretly be grateful for

53
00:04:57,450 --> 00:05:04,200
them when they make sense so when they
do make sense they have the ability to

54
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:09,150
help us improve our code and learn from
the mistakes that we make when they

55
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:14,580
don't make sense
maybe one of two things can happen one

56
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:18,419
we've seen the error or the type before
and we can have a guess at what went

57
00:05:18,419 --> 00:05:22,610
wrong and the odds are that this is
going to sink a potentially unnecessary

58
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:27,240
amount of time into debugging the issue
because we didn't have the relevant

59
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:34,680
information from the start or we don't
understand the error and the wording

60
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:40,889
makes us feel bad about something that
we've done just gonna be this there for

61
00:05:40,889 --> 00:05:43,220
a second

62
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:49,740
so we can feel like we don't know how
the language works and we can possibly

63
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:53,550
feel embarrassed that we don't
understand the error or what we've done

64
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:59,790
wrong both of which do nothing for our
drive to improve and learn and it can be

65
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:05,220
detrimental to our belief in our
capability so I've asked Donnie so let

66
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:08,790
me share their tweet because I was
immediately struck by it when I first

67
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:15,990
read it and it says as tool builders
we're gatekeepers every time we print an

68
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:20,490
incomprehensible error message someone
decides they're not good enough at

69
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:26,370
coding and even though I've been working
in this industry for a few years I come

70
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:30,030
across error messages pretty frequently
that make me feel like I have no idea

71
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:34,500
what I'm doing and they make my faith
and what I think I understand pretty

72
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:40,950
wobbly so today I want to focus on point
number two when error messages make us

73
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:45,780
feel bad I want to highlight what I
think are some of the problems in the

74
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:49,560
way that error messages are communicated
and I've picked a few examples to

75
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:53,670
illustrate my point so try to consider
what I'm saying as a blanket statement

76
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:59,370
for error messages you might have seen
out in the wild so let's begin type

77
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:06,990
error undefined is not a function
problem we've got here is ambiguity to

78
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:10,169
one extent or another all of the error
messages that I'm going to show you are

79
00:07:10,169 --> 00:07:15,870
ambiguous they aren't specific about
what has gone wrong and this wording

80
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:21,180
implies that we know where to start if
we see this error and while this might

81
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:26,669
be true for some we could all just be
helped along if we knew what the context

82
00:07:26,669 --> 00:07:32,820
was the message here is being ambiguous
by not telling us what the air were

83
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:37,110
undefined is referencing and little
caveat to be fair most bravura browsers

84
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:41,280
have implemented a referencing system
but this doesn't detract from the fact

85
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:47,720
that this still applies to other error
messages uncaught error object object

86
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:56,760
yay so big problem that we have here is
succinct Ness in most cases unhelpful

87
00:07:56,760 --> 00:08:01,000
error messages
our short perhaps their short and to the

88
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,710
point for some but it's entirely
possible that the point is completely

89
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:11,139
missed by others and I don't mean we
need to write a novel about the details

90
00:08:11,139 --> 00:08:14,830
of the error message but a sentence or
two could help shed a lot of light onto

91
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:19,960
the problem whatever the real error is
here it's been shrunk down to two

92
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:27,189
generally unhelpful words and finally
unexpected token comma expected comma

93
00:08:27,189 --> 00:08:33,430
guys this doesn't even look like a real
sentence but big problem we have here is

94
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:39,519
obfuscation this is on par with
ambiguity the specifics of what has gone

95
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:45,910
wrong are hidden away somewhere so
useful information is being withheld and

96
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:51,190
this is gonna add a complication from
the start in this example logically a

97
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:55,839
comma is a comma so something else must
have gone wrong I just don't have the

98
00:08:55,839 --> 00:09:02,560
information to know what that is or how
to deal with it so let me reiterate what

99
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:08,620
I'm saying by creating an imaginary
scenario for you okay picture yourself

100
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:14,230
at the entrance of a hedge maze in
daylight there are no threats in this

101
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:21,360
maze and your objective is to get to the
center of it when you get lost a

102
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:26,769
mystical Boulder will materialize with
directions on it so you step into the

103
00:09:26,769 --> 00:09:33,310
maze and after a few right turns and a
few wrong turns you come to a fork but

104
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:38,680
you find that you've lost your sense of
direction boom magical Boulder has a

105
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:45,870
sentence on it and that sentence says
turn north

106
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:52,779
and so this is how I feel when I deal
with an error message that I don't

107
00:09:52,779 --> 00:09:58,540
understand so next time we write error
messages let's try to keep these things

108
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:05,800
in mind context to counter ambiguity
have we provided a connection between

109
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:13,900
the problem and what is causing it
elaboration to counter what was it that

110
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:18,279
I said it's a sickness
sorry good are we being sufficiently

111
00:10:18,279 --> 00:10:25,140
verbose have we provided relevant
details about the problem and finally

112
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:32,110
clarity to counter obfuscation overall
is our message clear have we surfaced

113
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:37,620
all of the things that are important
about the error in our explanation of it

114
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:42,640
I've raised these points to aid us in
moving away from general assumptions

115
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:46,390
that we can make about what our users
understand and this will allow our

116
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:49,890
wording to be as inclusive as possible

117
00:10:50,339 --> 00:10:56,290
but these points also apply to our
documentation which brings me to the

118
00:10:56,290 --> 00:11:03,279
read me read knees are pretty crucial to
our projects they're often the single

119
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:07,870
source of documentation that a user will
come across so what we say and how we

120
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:13,570
choose to convey it is very important I
know I bragged about my company a little

121
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:16,750
bit at the beginning but it's mostly so
that I can point out that we also make

122
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:21,570
these mistakes and take for example this
readme

123
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:26,680
it belongs to a public repository that
the FT owns and this is it there's

124
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:36,850
nothing more to it I want everyone to
focus on this bit of it I have so many

125
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:47,380
questions so what is this library what's
wrong with installing it globally what

126
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:53,620
package manager a moment to use what is
n B T or n bt5 for that matter and why

127
00:11:53,620 --> 00:12:00,110
does it get its own patches so who is
this even for and first off

128
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:04,700
just because I work there when I know
this this read me assumes that everyone

129
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:10,820
knows where the library should be used
no context it gives you a warning about

130
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:16,690
installation but no installation
instructions so there's no elaboration

131
00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:21,019
and ultimately there's no explicit
explanation for what this library

132
00:12:21,019 --> 00:12:26,180
actually does so there's no clarity
either and the fact is that this whole

133
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:33,110
project assumes that you work for the FT
it assumes that you know what our

134
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:37,940
workflow is like it assumes that you
know what our tools are and is done

135
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:41,990
really unhelpful but while all of that
may be true for the people that already

136
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:48,440
work there it's just not helpful helpful
for someone that may have just joined

137
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:56,180
for example but after raising all of
this in-house we've changed it so if you

138
00:12:56,180 --> 00:13:01,660
guys go looking for it it's not gonna
look like this anymore we've specified

139
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:06,649
what this project is used for and we've
provided further information for anyone

140
00:13:06,649 --> 00:13:12,740
that might need it or might want it and
not only were installation instructions

141
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:20,060
vague there were two years out of date
so we've elaborated and provided and

142
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:26,930
explicit installation commands and we've
provided clarity so we've emitted

143
00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:30,670
abbreviations and there's more
information

144
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:36,709
overall we've been more explicit about
the functionality of this project so we

145
00:13:36,709 --> 00:13:41,899
facilitator other people's use of it I'm
aware that there's a lot more that we

146
00:13:41,899 --> 00:13:48,010
should add to this readme but I don't
have time and it doesn't fit on one side

147
00:13:48,010 --> 00:13:54,589
so even if we don't have time to go
through everything right now remembering

148
00:13:54,589 --> 00:14:00,110
to supply context elaborate where
relevant and provide clarity will help

149
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:07,850
us improve the way in which we write but
writing isn't the only way in which we

150
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:13,690
communicate in this industry we talk a
lot to exhibit a

151
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:18,010
so in addition to what we've covered so
far

152
00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:26,780
the next equally important point to
consider is who is your audience and I

153
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:35,020
can't stress this enough whom are we
speaking to and who are we writing for

154
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:41,660
everybody in this audience exists in a
different spectrum of experience and

155
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:48,620
understanding so when we talk to someone
from our version of the spectrum we talk

156
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:51,680
through the filters of our own
experience and this is really important

157
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:57,770
to be aware of these are our own
experiences and conversely when we talk

158
00:14:57,770 --> 00:15:01,520
to somebody else we're talking to
somebody that has a spectrum all of

159
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:08,390
their own and that is made up of their
experiences so if we want to have a good

160
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:14,840
exchange we need to find common ground
together instead of assuming there is

161
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:21,380
common ground and we probably don't
intend it badly when we assume someone

162
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:25,790
else will know what we're talking about
and hey maybe they do but we could be

163
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:30,650
clear from the beginning and there are a
few things that we can do to improve our

164
00:15:30,650 --> 00:15:36,950
communication firstly we can start by
acknowledging that we do make

165
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:43,250
assumptions at one point or another this
means that we can begin to notice the

166
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:50,300
things that we can improve second when
we are talking about something we should

167
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:58,310
work to elaborate without judgment it
takes practice absolutely but it's

168
00:15:58,310 --> 00:16:02,330
important to learn not to assume that
the person you are speaking to knows

169
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:08,960
what you were talking about and thereby
provide more information that was loud

170
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:14,450
sorry
so I have found myself explaining to

171
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:19,130
something to someone in a way that makes
perfect sense to me until I look up and

172
00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:25,430
I see the person looking a little bit
like this and I've had that look on my

173
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:28,910
face a few times as well
and usually it's because I didn't get

174
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:33,770
that extra bit of elaboration I didn't
understand the context I may have missed

175
00:16:33,770 --> 00:16:41,440
the Darden perhaps I just didn't know
what they were saying but just

176
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:50,899
elaborating isn't enough we need to pay
attention to how we say what we say we

177
00:16:50,899 --> 00:16:56,510
understand the world through the words
we use through the words we hear and

178
00:16:56,510 --> 00:17:02,000
through the words that we read so
consider that very carefully in this

179
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,530
case it doesn't matter who you talk to
but the words that you choose to speak

180
00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:12,439
with are far from inconsequential and
this brings me to a few examples of

181
00:17:12,439 --> 00:17:19,579
language that we can learn to avoid as
outlined in the Code of Conduct for this

182
00:17:19,579 --> 00:17:25,250
conference commentary like you would be
crazy to think you would have to be

183
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:31,670
blind not to notice is a list
it's ablest and it's alienating if you

184
00:17:31,670 --> 00:17:36,140
do think in a particular way or if you
don't notice something whether or not

185
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:45,080
you have a disability and it's degrading
language so please leave this out words

186
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:53,450
and phrasing like all you need to do
just obviously clearly simply they

187
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:59,540
trivialize what may not be obvious or
clear to someone else and they're filler

188
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:11,360
words and we can omit these too and
finally everyone knows or any developer

189
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:14,050
worth their salt

190
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:25,900
there are examples of career
generalizations that can be exclusionary

191
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:31,490
we've already covered the fact that we
don't know what others know and setting

192
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:36,100
arbitrary benchmarks for someone's
knowledge or worth is just destructive

193
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:46,100
so let's not use these either make sure
that you give your interactions your

194
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:58,010
full attention with that we can start
picking up on the things that we say we

195
00:18:58,010 --> 00:19:01,940
may use some of the language that I just
talked about unconsciously and in fact I

196
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:07,669
know that I do I probably just said just
somewhere like there it happens but the

197
00:19:07,669 --> 00:19:14,120
beauty of interacting with somebody else
is that we can ask questions so do ask

198
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:20,870
ask questions about the content of your
conversations and provide your listeners

199
00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:25,250
with the opportunity to correct you
where you may not notice that you might

200
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:31,480
have made a mistake and when we do ask
those questions and provide that chance

201
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:37,309
there's benefit in it for us as well we
can take that opportunity to learn about

202
00:19:37,309 --> 00:19:41,080
what our assumptions were in that
scenario and begin to correct ourselves

203
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:45,490
when we notice that our language might
have slipped

204
00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:49,820
so with these points and lines we can go
into our conversations with more

205
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:59,690
awareness make them more productive more
effective and more inclusive I need to

206
00:19:59,690 --> 00:20:03,850
let this slide because it's a good gift

207
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:15,549
so I'd like to stress that this is a
learning process and it takes practice

208
00:20:15,549 --> 00:20:20,499
and we will probably make mistakes
throughout that process but it also

209
00:20:20,499 --> 00:20:25,090
doesn't cost you anything to practice
and you lose nothing by making the

210
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:32,460
effort unlike this cat so if we practice
acknowledging our assumptions

211
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:38,440
elaborating without judgment asking
questions and paying attention to the

212
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:43,480
words that we use will benefit from
richer and more constructive

213
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:54,129
interactions going forward I am
definitely pouring a lot of energy into

214
00:20:54,129 --> 00:20:58,149
pointing out assumptions an overall
implying that they have negative effects

215
00:20:58,149 --> 00:21:05,490
and while this is true it is also true
to a large extent that assumptions are

216
00:21:05,490 --> 00:21:10,720
simplifications that make life possible
for example if we're walking along a

217
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:15,490
sidewalk we do so relatively confidently
because we assume that the drivers

218
00:21:15,490 --> 00:21:20,139
aren't gonna drive up in front of us and
the drivers drive confidently assuming

219
00:21:20,139 --> 00:21:22,259
that people aren't gonna leap out in
front of a street in front of them

220
00:21:22,259 --> 00:21:27,940
helpful so if we had to double check
with every driver going by that that was

221
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:34,929
the case nobody would ever get anywhere
and it would be equally unrealistic to

222
00:21:34,929 --> 00:21:38,710
try and have an answer for every
possible situation that we find

223
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:46,029
ourselves assuming in which really begs
the question once you start where do you

224
00:21:46,029 --> 00:21:54,369
stop the correct answer that everybody
really wants to know is that there is no

225
00:21:54,369 --> 00:22:01,480
correct answer ultimately we don't have
the brain power or the time to come up

226
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:07,779
with a solution to every scenario but we
can lay the foundations in the word

227
00:22:07,779 --> 00:22:14,710
choices that we make for our errors for
our documentation and our speech which

228
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:21,070
can cover a lot of ground where we can't
cover every eventuality which

229
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:27,039
for the last time brings me back to we
don't know what others know and others

230
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:29,880
don't know what we know

231
00:22:29,909 --> 00:22:38,049
so in all types of communication let us
strive to provide context to elaborate

232
00:22:38,049 --> 00:22:45,149
freely to convey clarity to be aware of
the words that we communicate with and

233
00:22:45,149 --> 00:22:52,720
to ask so that we can learn and apply
what we learned to ourselves with that

234
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:57,669
will be setting ourselves up for better
interactions and will already be at a

235
00:22:57,669 --> 00:23:04,480
huge advantage finally I would like to
leave you with a quote by American

236
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:11,169
novelist Ursula Guin which I might have
browsed incorrectly words transform both

237
00:23:11,169 --> 00:23:16,620
speaker and hearer they feed energy back
and forth and amplify it

238
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:26,019
they feed understanding or emotion back
and forth and amplify it so remember the
