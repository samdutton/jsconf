00:00:07,139 --> 00:00:09,550

I'm gonna talk today about style guide

2
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:11,590
driven development on a project that

3
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:14,740
I've been working on at pivotal labs how

4
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:15,970
many people here have done test-driven

5
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:19,060
development Oh awesome so a whole bunch

6
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:21,579
of you do you mind if you haven't done

7
00:00:21,579 --> 00:00:22,810
test-driven development raising your

8
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:27,759
hand I see a few ok so basically and

9
00:00:27,759 --> 00:00:28,989
this is gonna be my summary of

10
00:00:28,989 --> 00:00:31,119
test-driven development because from

11
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:32,710
what I've seen so far everybody that

12
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:34,059
I've ever asked about it comes up with a

13
00:00:34,059 --> 00:00:35,530
different answer for exactly what it

14
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:37,870
means but the rough idea is how do you

15
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:40,359
work incrementally and write tests that

16
00:00:40,359 --> 00:00:42,250
are going to figure out whether you're

17
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:44,019
on the path to getting your code to do

18
00:00:44,019 --> 00:00:46,120
what you want it to do or not and then

19
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:49,199
how do you then later use those tests to

20
00:00:49,199 --> 00:00:51,489
to make sure that your code still works

21
00:00:51,489 --> 00:00:53,649
when you make other changes and that

22
00:00:53,649 --> 00:00:55,300
sounds fantastic but sometimes it kind

23
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:56,920
of works with CSS and other times it

24
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:59,050
doesn't really and so in my project we

25
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:00,249
came up with something called style

26
00:01:00,249 --> 00:01:02,079
guide style guide driven development

27
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:04,480
which I think the pivotal labs New York

28
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:06,760
office actually sort of started using

29
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:08,530
that term first and I'm not even really

30
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:10,390
sure where they got it but it's been

31
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:11,770
working out pretty well so I want to

32
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:13,800
tell you a little bit about it I'm

33
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,940
sewing to talk about a few things first

34
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:19,870
the goals the challenges our plan how we

35
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:22,330
execute it on it and the results that we

36
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:24,160
got and it gets super important to focus

37
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:26,050
on results because it's something that's

38
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:28,060
really the right approach then it has

39
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:31,510
good results so our goal was to reskin

40
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:34,420
the site to match some new branding we

41
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:37,300
had this site which was you know very

42
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:41,230
heavy and was loading super slow and

43
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:43,030
generally weren't happy with it there

44
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:44,350
were a bunch of things that that just

45
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:45,940
weren't right and the designers really

46
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:49,060
wanted to change it too these were the

47
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:50,770
sort of intermediate designs we came up

48
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:52,720
with we had a two-phase project the

49
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,060
first one we called we called B flat

50
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:56,410
because we knew that we weren't going to

51
00:01:56,410 --> 00:01:59,740
get to do a huge change in the way any

52
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:01,320
of the UX worked we just needed to

53
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,690
flatten things out and get some of the

54
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:07,150
excess UI stuff out of there and then

55
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:09,160
very shortly after we did another

56
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:11,050
redesign which this is what we ended up

57
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:12,060
with

58
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:15,150
basically we didn't know for sure that

59
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:16,680
this would be such a different design

60
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:19,170
when we were going through it but even

61
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:20,790
still the component system that we built

62
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:22,920
and the style guide really helped us get

63
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:25,349
through two major redesigns in something

64
00:02:25,349 --> 00:02:29,430
like three or four months so the

65
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:31,440
challenges there were a lot of them

66
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:35,670
actually first there was so much CSS 91%

67
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:38,069
of it unused but on a standard page it

68
00:02:38,069 --> 00:02:43,200
was like 314 KB uncompressed it was not

69
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,030
so much slowing the page down I mean

70
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:46,379
that was part of it but it was just

71
00:02:46,379 --> 00:02:49,019
really unwieldy to work with we had

72
00:02:49,019 --> 00:02:51,569
custom CSS per view it's a rails app and

73
00:02:51,569 --> 00:02:53,640
rails really wants to encourage you to

74
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:57,000
write CSS a separate CSS file for every

75
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,530
single view that you have in your app

76
00:02:58,530 --> 00:02:59,819
and you kind of have to fight it to get

77
00:02:59,819 --> 00:03:02,519
it not to not to have you do that source

78
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:05,129
CSS tended to be either deeply nested

79
00:03:05,129 --> 00:03:08,400
and specific and so not reusable at all

80
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,579
or it was extremely global almost

81
00:03:11,579 --> 00:03:13,170
impossible to know the scope and where

82
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:15,000
it was used and what in fact you'd break

83
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,690
if you changed any of it we also had a

84
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:20,190
problem with layout proliferation

85
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:21,660
layouts and rails are your sort of

86
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:23,519
top-level templates that your starting

87
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:25,560
points for your app it seemed like for

88
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,120
basically every single page we had

89
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,650
created a new a new starting point

90
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:31,230
layout even though they weren't actually

91
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:32,489
substantially different

92
00:03:32,489 --> 00:03:34,169
what tended to be different in them was

93
00:03:34,169 --> 00:03:37,349
actually the content area and when we

94
00:03:37,349 --> 00:03:38,669
would make changes we've quite

95
00:03:38,669 --> 00:03:40,799
frequently forget that we had another

96
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:43,349
layout for you know some random page and

97
00:03:43,349 --> 00:03:45,629
end up with end up with one of our

98
00:03:45,629 --> 00:03:47,400
layouts being broken because it wasn't

99
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:51,180
up to date we also kind of had partials

100
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:55,139
inception someone on the team before we

101
00:03:55,139 --> 00:03:56,849
all started must have really loved

102
00:03:56,849 --> 00:03:58,769
creating partials we had partials for

103
00:03:58,769 --> 00:04:01,199
things that weren't shared anywhere we

104
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:03,959
had we had like nested layers like each

105
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:06,120
partial would have like a line or two in

106
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,169
it and then it would point to another

107
00:04:07,169 --> 00:04:08,879
partial a line or two and it would point

108
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:11,099
to another partial you get like 12 deep

109
00:04:11,099 --> 00:04:13,079
before you could finally see anything

110
00:04:13,079 --> 00:04:15,919
about what was going on in your partial

111
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:19,620
we also had a sort of more buttons more

112
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:22,109
better philosophy we had like 20 or 30

113
00:04:22,109 --> 00:04:23,729
different kinds of buttons different

114
00:04:23,729 --> 00:04:24,760
sizes you couldn't

115
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:25,990
and always see that they were different

116
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:27,700
they look like the same orange button

117
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:31,210
but actually they were you know pixel

118
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:32,950
difference or they looked exactly the

119
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:34,510
same but they were actually coded twice

120
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:36,760
and so you'd end up with extra images

121
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,590
because of course everything was done

122
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:41,830
with images it didn't have any css3 so

123
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:44,080
it's really hard to change designers

124
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,030
would ask for what should be a simple

125
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:48,550
thing like I'd like to update the button

126
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:50,350
styles for the small green buttons and

127
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:51,820
we would give them estimates like well

128
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:53,320
that'll probably take a week which is

129
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,940
just not the amount of time it should

130
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:58,900
take to change a button style over we

131
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:01,740
also had jQuery soup and a lot of it

132
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:04,990
everything was these custom widgets and

133
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:07,240
one-offs setup on the page rather than

134
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,970
reusable we had like six different ways

135
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:12,970
of toggling something which just seemed

136
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:16,390
a little bit crazy we've also put our

137
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:18,430
frameworks in our assets file which in

138
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:19,930
rails that's where your own code is

139
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:21,940
supposed to go which meant that people

140
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:23,350
felt like it was ok to change them

141
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:25,390
because the Heron assets and so we end

142
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:27,010
up with like all these different

143
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:29,590
frameworks all in assets and slightly

144
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:31,210
modified from their originals so

145
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:35,590
basically impossible to upgrade we also

146
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:38,170
had a sort of epic stories that were

147
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:40,240
sort of difficult to estimate they give

148
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,800
us a story that was along the lines of

149
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,050
redesigned the marketplace page and

150
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:46,210
we're like yeah that could be you know

151
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:48,040
that could be a few days or that could

152
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,750
be a few weeks it's super hard to tell

153
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:52,900
how long that's going to take we also

154
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:54,760
had a crazy deadline constraint we had

155
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:57,070
about six weeks and the design wasn't

156
00:05:57,070 --> 00:05:59,350
complete when we got started basically

157
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:01,000
our PM was supportive but at the same

158
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,410
time he knew that we had to get the

159
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:04,570
first version of the site out and he

160
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:06,640
basically said I need to see some

161
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:09,040
progress by January first and if I don't

162
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:12,250
then I'm gonna have to call the project

163
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:14,740
off and we're gonna just have to you

164
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:16,510
know reskin it whatever we have to do

165
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:18,760
whatever crazy terrible CSS we have to

166
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,980
write and I was like no no please give

167
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:23,350
me time we're gonna do it definitely

168
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:25,120
didn't want to write more crazy on top

169
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:28,960
of the crazy that we already had it was

170
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,580
a little overwhelming the constraints

171
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:33,190
were pretty tough so we started thinking

172
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:35,380
about how to get there we know what we

173
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:37,580
wanted to look like

174
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:39,439
what we have was too fragile and brittle

175
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:42,370
to really get it there incrementally so

176
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:44,569
what did we want to do we basically

177
00:06:44,569 --> 00:06:46,099
decided that we needed to build

178
00:06:46,099 --> 00:06:48,949
components and start using style guide

179
00:06:48,949 --> 00:06:51,379
driven development to sort of rescue our

180
00:06:51,379 --> 00:06:53,449
project from the the chaos that had gone

181
00:06:53,449 --> 00:06:55,520
into I should mention as well our

182
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,800
velocity was really low we were having

183
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,300
trouble releasing features which is

184
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:00,889
something that happens to teams when

185
00:07:00,889 --> 00:07:01,909
they get into a place where their

186
00:07:01,909 --> 00:07:04,189
front-end code is really messy it gets

187
00:07:04,189 --> 00:07:05,810
really hard to get something new out

188
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:07,250
because you're having to work around all

189
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:11,750
this legacy to get anything released and

190
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:13,849
some components helped us structure the

191
00:07:13,849 --> 00:07:15,650
site and now I'll give you a little demo

192
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:18,259
and this style guide is actually live on

193
00:07:18,259 --> 00:07:24,770
the web so you can check it out I will

194
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:26,360
tweet out the link later but it's at

195
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,819
console run pivotal do and it's slash

196
00:07:28,819 --> 00:07:31,250
style guide and we decided to build on

197
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:33,110
top of bootstrap mainly because the

198
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:36,169
product wasn't defined yet we didn't

199
00:07:36,169 --> 00:07:37,639
know exactly what it was going to be or

200
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:39,169
what it was for the designers were still

201
00:07:39,169 --> 00:07:40,759
doing a lot of user testing and still

202
00:07:40,759 --> 00:07:42,830
figuring out like why would somebody use

203
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:45,889
this it's a tool for the product that I

204
00:07:45,889 --> 00:07:48,770
work on is a tool for being able to

205
00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:50,539
scale cloud applications adding

206
00:07:50,539 --> 00:07:52,669
instances and and things like that being

207
00:07:52,669 --> 00:07:54,080
able to check the health of your system

208
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,839
and make sure that your your apps are

209
00:07:56,839 --> 00:07:58,580
running well and that they you know

210
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:01,370
being able to change different setup of

211
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:05,569
them live and on the cloud and so it's a

212
00:08:05,569 --> 00:08:07,490
funny product to be working on because a

213
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:09,020
lot of people who are going to want to

214
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:10,400
change these things are going to be much

215
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,199
more comfortable in a CLI than they are

216
00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:14,599
in a web app and they're going to want

217
00:08:14,599 --> 00:08:17,330
to go to a CLI so our designers we're

218
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:18,710
still doing a lot of research to figure

219
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:23,360
out why would somebody use this over you

220
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,979
know over the CLI over the tool that

221
00:08:24,979 --> 00:08:27,050
they're pretty comfortable with and some

222
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:28,520
of the things that we'd found out were

223
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:30,770
people said they'd use it on mobile so

224
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:32,719
you know what if I need to scale the app

225
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:34,640
because I get an incident report on my

226
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,469
mobile phone I get an alert but I don't

227
00:08:36,469 --> 00:08:38,269
actually have my computer with me

228
00:08:38,269 --> 00:08:40,519
I could add instances or I could restart

229
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:42,380
the app from my mobile phone and so

230
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:43,490
that's some of the stuff that we're

231
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:45,890
still figuring out what it's for and so

232
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:47,420
building on top of bootstrap meant that

233
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:48,480
we didn't have to know

234
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,699
what we were doing ahead of time we

235
00:08:50,699 --> 00:08:52,589
weren't making the most optimized system

236
00:08:52,589 --> 00:08:54,570
we were trying to make a system that we

237
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:56,880
could iterate with and then and then get

238
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,829
better swim a whole bunch of different

239
00:08:58,829 --> 00:09:00,959
kinds of components in here from alerts

240
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:03,449
to app status this is where you would

241
00:09:03,449 --> 00:09:06,110
stop or restart your app different

242
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:08,070
different kinds of things that we would

243
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:11,070
use all different sorts of buttons fewer

244
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:12,769
than we had before which is fantastic

245
00:09:12,769 --> 00:09:15,510
our colors and things like that so this

246
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:17,579
may seem like a lot of colors but we had

247
00:09:17,579 --> 00:09:20,160
way way way more before so this is sort

248
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,589
of continuing to constrain it down to

249
00:09:22,589 --> 00:09:25,170
sort of a more reasonable number and

250
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:27,000
different different kinds of things

251
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,740
Gravett ours and grids and health

252
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:33,180
indicators all kinds of stuff oh and

253
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:34,649
we've since broken it up into different

254
00:09:34,649 --> 00:09:36,180
areas because we're having trouble

255
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:38,339
finding things but the categories aren't

256
00:09:38,339 --> 00:09:39,720
necessarily working that well because

257
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,430
you still don't know where something's

258
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:44,130
going to be anyway so that's roughly how

259
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:45,959
the style guide works so you know we

260
00:09:45,959 --> 00:09:47,610
might have progress bars or whatever

261
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:50,190
else so when somebody needs that we

262
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:53,069
actually use Hamel for the most part so

263
00:09:53,069 --> 00:09:56,040
they have a Hamel example exactly what

264
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,510
they'd have to copy/paste in order to

265
00:09:57,510 --> 00:10:00,480
get that into a particular page and then

266
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,519
we have the rendered versions of each of

267
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:04,949
those so the goal is to make it really

268
00:10:04,949 --> 00:10:06,810
super easy for people to use existing

269
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:09,569
components much easier than it is for

270
00:10:09,569 --> 00:10:12,120
them to make up their own stuff

271
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:19,709
basically um so here are some of the

272
00:10:19,709 --> 00:10:21,600
results some of the numbers that we got

273
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,420
we had a lot fewer layouts we moved from

274
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:26,490
about seven layouts to two which felt a

275
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:28,199
lot better we needed to have one

276
00:10:28,199 --> 00:10:30,300
simplified layer States so that we

277
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:31,170
didn't have

278
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:33,360
we weren't dependent on having data

279
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,279
available for our error states to render

280
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:37,380
correctly but still we were pretty happy

281
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:41,130
with that change we had 21 image

282
00:10:41,130 --> 00:10:44,639
requests before at 82 KB down to 2 image

283
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:47,819
requests at 21.9 KB so pretty good

284
00:10:47,819 --> 00:10:49,589
pretty good improvement in image size I

285
00:10:49,589 --> 00:10:51,360
think frankly we could go a little bit

286
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,670
further but you know we've got a little

287
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:56,310
work to do in order to do that our CSS

288
00:10:56,310 --> 00:11:00,149
moved from 314 KB to 128 from to me

289
00:11:00,149 --> 00:11:01,520
that's still big that's

290
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:04,220
a lot but we're not at the point in our

291
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:05,990
app where we're ready to be optimizing

292
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:08,330
for like the the high use case we're

293
00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:10,220
right now still like figuring out what

294
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:11,930
we are and what we're gonna do and what

295
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:14,030
we're building and why people use it and

296
00:11:14,030 --> 00:11:15,410
stuff like that so that seems like a

297
00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:18,860
good middle ground for us right now we

298
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:21,860
also moved the compressed CSS from 44 KB

299
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:25,130
down to 22 yeah still a little high

300
00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:27,440
especially given that we don't have a

301
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,570
mobile version of the site the the

302
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:32,600
site's responsive and just works well

303
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,880
you know as best we can just works on

304
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,250
mobile so that means that you know

305
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:39,680
unfortunately that much that much CSS

306
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,030
getting sent over the wire is kind of

307
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:42,590
high definitely something we're looking

308
00:11:42,590 --> 00:11:44,450
at for that inflection point when it'll

309
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:45,560
be the moment where we should really

310
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:49,460
start reducing that and so we went from

311
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:53,510
90% unused CSS to 69% the unfortunate

312
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:55,220
thing is 53% of that comes from

313
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:55,990
bootstrap

314
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:59,720
which is a little bit we don't want to

315
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,640
modify the framework because that would

316
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:04,400
make the upgrade path hard but if we use

317
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,840
the framework we get a lot of stuff we

318
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,640
don't want and that's in spite of

319
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,650
actually having pulled in all of

320
00:12:09,650 --> 00:12:11,420
bootstrap commented out all the at

321
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:14,030
includes and then uncommenting them as

322
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:15,710
we use them so we're not pulling in

323
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:18,350
everything just what we need but any one

324
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:20,330
bootstrap file actually has quite a bit

325
00:12:20,330 --> 00:12:23,090
of stuff in it and so you know while we

326
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:26,360
might not need like maybe we only want

327
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:28,400
regular progress bars or not animated

328
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,080
progress bars it all sort of comes

329
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:33,320
lumped in together so it's something

330
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,780
where we're thinking about and starting

331
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:37,370
to contribute back to bootstrap so that

332
00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:41,030
we can make it a little more granular so

333
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:42,500
how did we do it that's that's a little

334
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:43,940
bit of the results and how it turned out

335
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:46,100
but how did that happen

336
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:48,020
our hypothesis was basically that

337
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:50,330
components are hard and and pages are

338
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:52,700
relatively easier and that components

339
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:54,680
are actually a feature that should be

340
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:56,840
validated when they're documented in our

341
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:59,930
style guide faster design feedback meant

342
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:01,220
then we'd had a better sense if we were

343
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:02,720
going to make our release if we were on

344
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,200
the right track we basically started

345
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,730
having a story first that would be crate

346
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:09,620
X component and put it in the style

347
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:11,600
guide and that became really helpful

348
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,970
because straightaway if

349
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:15,740
sort of built it wrong the designer got

350
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:17,689
a chance to see it before we were you

351
00:13:17,689 --> 00:13:19,310
know eight miles deep into building a

352
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:21,769
particular page the the PM got to

353
00:13:21,769 --> 00:13:23,480
validate that it fit with what he was

354
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,699
expecting it to look like we would also

355
00:13:25,699 --> 00:13:27,470
kind of skip a bunch of the fine-tuning

356
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:29,720
of the animations and then do that in a

357
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:32,269
final pass with the designer once it was

358
00:13:32,269 --> 00:13:34,040
in the style guide but before it was on

359
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,959
the page and that worked out pretty well

360
00:13:35,959 --> 00:13:40,009
for us so the result was smaller more

361
00:13:40,009 --> 00:13:41,930
manageable stories a much more

362
00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:43,730
predictable delivery and our velocity

363
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:45,019
shot up

364
00:13:45,019 --> 00:13:48,680
I think the funny thing about about when

365
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:50,689
a team starts moving faster is that just

366
00:13:50,689 --> 00:13:52,069
moving faster and itself is super

367
00:13:52,069 --> 00:13:53,990
motivating and when you get that

368
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:55,459
motivation like you're like oh we're

369
00:13:55,459 --> 00:13:56,870
getting work done where we're churning

370
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:59,240
through things all of a sudden it feels

371
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:02,750
much more viable to be able to output a

372
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:06,589
large volume of work we also moved to

373
00:14:06,589 --> 00:14:08,509
bootstrap three tip they could take

374
00:14:08,509 --> 00:14:10,970
advantage of better support for modern

375
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:12,980
browsers and some of the responsive

376
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:15,230
stuff which I found really cool

377
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:17,569
we had a dependency on something called

378
00:14:17,569 --> 00:14:19,689
Rails admin which unfortunately wanted

379
00:14:19,689 --> 00:14:22,670
bootstrap too which is super annoying

380
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:24,230
but we ended up being able to break that

381
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:25,790
by only including that in the admin

382
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:28,610
pages which are not actually accessed by

383
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:32,000
real users and put it in the agenda to

384
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,009
later build our own admin pages so that

385
00:14:34,009 --> 00:14:37,639
we wouldn't be dependent on that we also

386
00:14:37,639 --> 00:14:38,959
used something called hologram from

387
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:42,019
Trulia for our style guide and Susan Lin

388
00:14:42,019 --> 00:14:44,389
is in the audience today and she she

389
00:14:44,389 --> 00:14:46,639
worked with me at Trulia just before

390
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:49,279
they actually created hologram so I had

391
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:51,230
made a style guide generation tool in my

392
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:53,329
company and I thought it was awesome

393
00:14:53,329 --> 00:14:55,009
it was so complicated you wouldn't even

394
00:14:55,009 --> 00:14:57,649
believe it and I was like oh this is

395
00:14:57,649 --> 00:14:59,300
fantastic this is the best style guide

396
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:01,399
generator ever and the moment I stopped

397
00:15:01,399 --> 00:15:02,870
working with truly they were very polite

398
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:04,579
while I worked there but the moment I

399
00:15:04,579 --> 00:15:06,350
stopped working with them they switched

400
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:07,670
away from that style guide tool

401
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:09,199
immediately and built their own and I

402
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:12,110
was like oh but then I tried theirs and

403
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:14,029
it was actually fantastic it was so much

404
00:15:14,029 --> 00:15:16,189
better than mine you wouldn't believe so

405
00:15:16,189 --> 00:15:18,040
then I switched over to theirs instead

406
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:21,170
it's a really great tool it basically

407
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:23,120
allows you to have markdown and your CSS

408
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,040
so if you look up here I know it's a

409
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,560
little bit light to see

410
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,690
you basically have a markdown comment

411
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:30,700
doc and it gives you the title the name

412
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:33,190
in the category and so based on the

413
00:15:33,190 --> 00:15:34,540
things that you put in there and you can

414
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:36,250
put tables in as well and you can put

415
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:37,900
your actual documentation and markdown

416
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:40,420
right near the CSS that it's actually

417
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:42,760
documenting which for us was a big key

418
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:44,290
to actually keeping the two synched up

419
00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:46,960
as long as those were in separate files

420
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:49,750
it was just too easy for them to get out

421
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:52,690
of sync with each other one cool thing

422
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:54,460
you can do is also have a sub component

423
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:56,950
so here you have the same the title name

424
00:15:56,950 --> 00:15:58,300
and category that you could have skipped

425
00:15:58,300 --> 00:15:59,890
the category in this case because it has

426
00:15:59,890 --> 00:16:02,380
a parent panel so it's a square panel

427
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:03,820
and it's a parent of panel and that

428
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:05,920
allows us to do the the nesting and the

429
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,630
style guide automatically without needed

430
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:09,310
to do any work to actually make that

431
00:16:09,310 --> 00:16:12,490
happen we also found that the

432
00:16:12,490 --> 00:16:14,680
combination of this and bootstrap 3

433
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:16,630
we're actually writing very very little

434
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:19,089
CSS and yet having a pretty clean

435
00:16:19,089 --> 00:16:22,600
experience the generated style guide is

436
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,580
going to look something like this with

437
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:27,310
all of our different classes documented

438
00:16:27,310 --> 00:16:29,860
in the table the modifier class that you

439
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:31,870
need to make that happen there and then

440
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:35,020
underneath the rendered example & hamill

441
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:38,530
example we've since taken on a larger

442
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:40,420
scope which is to be used by a bunch of

443
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:41,950
projects that are actually not written

444
00:16:41,950 --> 00:16:43,930
in rails so now we're going to be used

445
00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:46,270
by a project in Java project and go and

446
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:48,670
that's just too stupid so we're going to

447
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:51,480
be fully front-end and we're going to

448
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:54,250
basically break any dependence we have

449
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:57,270
with with any back-end languages so

450
00:16:57,270 --> 00:17:01,000
gonna have to have HTML examples in

451
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,160
there and full JavaScript rendering

452
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:04,780
which is sort of an interesting

453
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:09,130
challenge we'll see how that one goes so

454
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:10,510
what we found was the designers really

455
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:13,569
work in a view related world they work

456
00:17:13,569 --> 00:17:15,910
on a page at a time or a flow at a time

457
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:18,069
they're really thinking page by page by

458
00:17:18,069 --> 00:17:20,260
page and that that needed to be

459
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:22,089
translated for developer consumption

460
00:17:22,089 --> 00:17:23,829
like basically we needed it broken down

461
00:17:23,829 --> 00:17:25,780
into components but they really needed

462
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:27,850
to be thinking globally and so we did a

463
00:17:27,850 --> 00:17:31,060
lot of sort of work on how to do that so

464
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:32,770
basically this is our marketplace page

465
00:17:32,770 --> 00:17:35,560
and they're different sorts of services

466
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:37,420
that you can add to your AB databases

467
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:38,259
and

468
00:17:38,259 --> 00:17:40,149
testing services and things like that

469
00:17:40,149 --> 00:17:43,509
sort of standard things and so the

470
00:17:43,509 --> 00:17:45,190
designer might look at this and sort of

471
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:47,739
be thinking you know of this as an

472
00:17:47,739 --> 00:17:49,950
entire page an entire experience but

473
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:51,970
when we thought about it we were

474
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:54,129
thinking of it as little pieces and so

475
00:17:54,129 --> 00:17:56,080
there was a lot of tension of whose job

476
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,789
it was to actually break it down into

477
00:17:57,789 --> 00:18:01,480
component stories one of our PM's felt

478
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,830
like it really should be done by the

479
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:05,259
designers but they hadn't had experience

480
00:18:05,259 --> 00:18:06,340
in breaking something down into

481
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:08,769
components so that didn't quite work and

482
00:18:08,769 --> 00:18:11,350
then you know on the developer side we

483
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:13,149
wanted to take responsibility for it as

484
00:18:13,149 --> 00:18:14,470
well but we weren't always aware of

485
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:16,480
where the design was going and when it

486
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:19,149
was ready to be broken down so it kind

487
00:18:19,149 --> 00:18:22,239
of ended up being everybody's job so we

488
00:18:22,239 --> 00:18:23,590
would start breaking something down we

489
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:25,509
would build you know boxes and we'd

490
00:18:25,509 --> 00:18:27,159
build the media block and some of this

491
00:18:27,159 --> 00:18:28,629
existing and bootstraps some of it

492
00:18:28,629 --> 00:18:30,399
needing to be modified we'd build

493
00:18:30,399 --> 00:18:33,580
headings and body copy and three column

494
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:35,679
grids getting them just right for us

495
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:37,029
making sure they have the right gutters

496
00:18:37,029 --> 00:18:39,369
and making sure that they they layout

497
00:18:39,369 --> 00:18:41,679
properly in the way that we need that

498
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:42,759
they're going to flow and change

499
00:18:42,759 --> 00:18:45,700
according to page size so that ended up

500
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:48,190
being a lot on me at first I ended up

501
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:49,989
doing a lot of the translation step and

502
00:18:49,989 --> 00:18:52,059
actually found it really hard to teach

503
00:18:52,059 --> 00:18:54,009
that to people I'm I would love

504
00:18:54,009 --> 00:18:56,200
suggestions if you guys have it for good

505
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:58,840
ways to teach people to break down pages

506
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:01,899
into components still not 100% sure but

507
00:19:01,899 --> 00:19:04,090
I know that they're they're a lot better

508
00:19:04,090 --> 00:19:05,830
at it from pairing and working together

509
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:09,429
doing it very definitely are several

510
00:19:09,429 --> 00:19:10,779
people are starting to be able to do

511
00:19:10,779 --> 00:19:12,249
that and the designers started to talk

512
00:19:12,249 --> 00:19:14,619
about components once the once the page

513
00:19:14,619 --> 00:19:16,600
is done and the the experience has been

514
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,460
sort of crafted been the conversation

515
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:20,950
turning to practical things started to

516
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:23,259
naturally turn to components which is

517
00:19:23,259 --> 00:19:25,749
great but still I think we have a ways

518
00:19:25,749 --> 00:19:29,409
to go and that um so this is an example

519
00:19:29,409 --> 00:19:30,820
of a story that we would have in in

520
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:33,279
pivotal tracker the tracking software

521
00:19:33,279 --> 00:19:36,129
that we use but you could have it in any

522
00:19:36,129 --> 00:19:38,230
kind of tracking settest software like

523
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:41,320
my company used to use github issues and

524
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:44,230
and that works fine too so basically

525
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:45,850
create box components and document

526
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:48,279
document them in the style guide so

527
00:19:48,279 --> 00:19:49,299
boxes

528
00:19:49,299 --> 00:19:51,039
it says at the bottom boxes only include

529
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:52,690
borders background should go in

530
00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:54,340
background components and contents will

531
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:56,739
be created separately so this is a kind

532
00:19:56,739 --> 00:19:58,840
of instruction isn't necessary now but

533
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:00,340
in the beginning it was really hard for

534
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:02,169
people to tell from a mock-up which bit

535
00:20:02,169 --> 00:20:03,820
of the thing they were supposed to be

536
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:05,889
building we had all these crazy sketches

537
00:20:05,889 --> 00:20:07,690
weird people would outline in magenta

538
00:20:07,690 --> 00:20:10,059
that was supposed to be built and try to

539
00:20:10,059 --> 00:20:11,679
X out the bit that wasn't supposed to be

540
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:13,779
built and now I think people just have a

541
00:20:13,779 --> 00:20:16,149
natural sense for it but it was a little

542
00:20:16,149 --> 00:20:19,269
bit difficult in the beginning and so

543
00:20:19,269 --> 00:20:20,799
then we would have examples of the

544
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:23,769
different boxes images of them uploaded

545
00:20:23,769 --> 00:20:25,330
to the bug because no matter how you

546
00:20:25,330 --> 00:20:27,009
describe something it's just much better

547
00:20:27,009 --> 00:20:28,480
to see it when you're building something

548
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,669
visual and that that worked out pretty

549
00:20:30,669 --> 00:20:33,309
well and we create tasks sometimes for

550
00:20:33,309 --> 00:20:35,019
each of the kinds of boxes that we were

551
00:20:35,019 --> 00:20:36,970
going to build and that helped just keep

552
00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:38,739
us sort of organized and see how much

553
00:20:38,739 --> 00:20:42,359
closer we were getting to to being done

554
00:20:42,359 --> 00:20:46,059
so how many people here have seen me

555
00:20:46,059 --> 00:20:48,749
talk about object oriented CSS at all

556
00:20:48,749 --> 00:20:51,669
okay so a fair number but not everybody

557
00:20:51,669 --> 00:20:53,769
forgive me a little bit I kind of wanted

558
00:20:53,769 --> 00:20:55,509
to add a little detour into what makes a

559
00:20:55,509 --> 00:20:57,730
good component some of you if you've

560
00:20:57,730 --> 00:20:59,799
seen me talk about oo CSS are probably

561
00:20:59,799 --> 00:21:01,330
gonna have seen this before but I didn't

562
00:21:01,330 --> 00:21:03,580
want anybody to be left behind so added

563
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:06,489
about 10 slides of this so let's get

564
00:21:06,489 --> 00:21:06,970
into it

565
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:08,830
so basically if we think about building

566
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:10,809
boxes we have to figure out what is a

567
00:21:10,809 --> 00:21:12,399
good component and what makes a good

568
00:21:12,399 --> 00:21:14,590
component how do you define how much do

569
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:16,119
you put into it and how much do you

570
00:21:16,119 --> 00:21:18,909
break it into separate pieces and this

571
00:21:18,909 --> 00:21:21,100
is something that I find you know when

572
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:23,350
you first get started in CSS or maybe in

573
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:25,090
any language because I find myself doing

574
00:21:25,090 --> 00:21:28,090
it in Ruby for sure you really want

575
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:29,830
rules you want someone to tell you like

576
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:33,399
X is the way to do this thing and so

577
00:21:33,399 --> 00:21:35,230
people will ask me should I make this

578
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:37,690
into one component or should I break it

579
00:21:37,690 --> 00:21:40,359
into into two classes or should it be

580
00:21:40,359 --> 00:21:42,809
one component and then a modifier and

581
00:21:42,809 --> 00:21:47,980
often my answers are sort of sort of

582
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:49,749
like trade offs you know I'll say okay

583
00:21:49,749 --> 00:21:51,399
well the positives of putting it all in

584
00:21:51,399 --> 00:21:53,200
one are that you would only have one

585
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,580
class to apply and you get all that

586
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:56,559
behavior the negatives are if you want

587
00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:57,879
to use that separately from this you

588
00:21:57,879 --> 00:21:58,899
really can't you're going to have to

589
00:21:58,899 --> 00:21:59,990
make yet another new

590
00:21:59,990 --> 00:22:02,120
and then talking about breaking it out

591
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:04,910
saying well you know would it make sense

592
00:22:04,910 --> 00:22:08,810
to a user - for me a user as a developer

593
00:22:08,810 --> 00:22:11,600
sorry would it make sense to a developer

594
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,640
who's using the system to know what

595
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:16,010
those individual pieces mean my sort of

596
00:22:16,010 --> 00:22:18,440
guideline on that side is not having

597
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:20,240
anything that can't be shown and

598
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,430
understood in a style guide and the

599
00:22:22,430 --> 00:22:23,990
reason for that is you know float:left

600
00:22:23,990 --> 00:22:25,910
might feel like a really really great

601
00:22:25,910 --> 00:22:28,040
class to have you know how floats work

602
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,510
and you know that you have to clear them

603
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:31,130
and you know all the ins and outs of

604
00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:32,660
what might break if you float something

605
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:34,940
but I don't want to assume that the

606
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:37,870
people using my style guide to build

607
00:22:37,870 --> 00:22:40,430
functionality know what a float means I

608
00:22:40,430 --> 00:22:41,510
don't want them to have to think about

609
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:43,670
the guts of how CSS works when they're

610
00:22:43,670 --> 00:22:46,730
interacting with it um so that's sort of

611
00:22:46,730 --> 00:22:48,350
the trade-offs that I kind of try to

612
00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:50,000
think of and try to walk them through

613
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,670
but it's hard right it's it's it turns

614
00:22:52,670 --> 00:22:54,590
out like nothing really replaces a smart

615
00:22:54,590 --> 00:22:57,020
developer making good decisions in a in

616
00:22:57,020 --> 00:23:01,040
a given situation and I think that it's

617
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:03,020
it's difficult there are pros and cons

618
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:05,990
on both sides it's a little bit of the

619
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:07,820
anatomy of a good component let's look

620
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:10,550
at an example from Facebook this is

621
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:13,430
basically a media block example so it's

622
00:23:13,430 --> 00:23:15,050
an image on the left and stuff that

623
00:23:15,050 --> 00:23:17,450
describes it to the right this is in the

624
00:23:17,450 --> 00:23:19,550
Oh CSS open source project on github

625
00:23:19,550 --> 00:23:21,860
it's also in bootstrap now so you can

626
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:25,160
check it out there as well all of these

627
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:26,900
are actually a media blocks they're all

628
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:29,120
images with stuff that describes it to

629
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:32,330
the left or to the right they may look

630
00:23:32,330 --> 00:23:34,760
different they may be different sizes

631
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:36,050
and things like that but they but

632
00:23:36,050 --> 00:23:38,090
they're the same object so the first

633
00:23:38,090 --> 00:23:39,020
thing to think about when you're trying

634
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:41,300
to figure out if something is a good

635
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:42,560
component is to figure out what do you

636
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:44,750
know about it now with these we know

637
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:46,340
they can be nested right because we've

638
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:48,770
got we've got a nested one over here

639
00:23:48,770 --> 00:23:51,590
with a little envelope inside of that

640
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:54,230
particular that particular media block

641
00:23:54,230 --> 00:23:56,120
we know that they have an optional right

642
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:57,410
button because that one also has a

643
00:23:57,410 --> 00:23:59,360
little X on it where you can close it

644
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:01,640
away we know it's got a clear fix

645
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,800
because you don't want some content sort

646
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:06,740
of running up inside of the the media

647
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:08,950
blocks that you already have on the page

648
00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:11,150
but maybe a little bit more important to

649
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:12,290
think about what we don't know

650
00:24:12,290 --> 00:24:13,670
about it because what we don't know

651
00:24:13,670 --> 00:24:14,990
about this object it's where it's gonna

652
00:24:14,990 --> 00:24:17,630
be flexible where it's gonna solve more

653
00:24:17,630 --> 00:24:19,280
than one problem rather than just the

654
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:20,380
problem at hand

655
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:22,580
so what we'll notice is the image width

656
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:24,410
and decoration vary we don't have any

657
00:24:24,410 --> 00:24:26,360
idea how big the images in fact it could

658
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:28,030
be it could be a movie it could be

659
00:24:28,030 --> 00:24:30,740
anything it could be video or other kind

660
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:32,710
of content as long as it's fixed with

661
00:24:32,710 --> 00:24:35,870
the right contents also unknown in some

662
00:24:35,870 --> 00:24:37,610
cases it's a list in some cases it's

663
00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:39,920
just a simple link in some cases it's

664
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:42,500
fairly complex with links and lists and

665
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:44,660
all sorts of things put in it so we

666
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:45,890
don't want to assume anything about

667
00:24:45,890 --> 00:24:47,960
what's gonna be contained inside of this

668
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:50,750
media block and the other thing is that

669
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:52,490
the width is unknown so we've got one

670
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:53,750
little one up there but we've got

671
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:55,730
another one that's really wide and if we

672
00:24:55,730 --> 00:24:58,400
made this exactly 467 pixels wide

673
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,050
because that's how wide the sidebar

674
00:25:00,050 --> 00:25:01,280
happened to be in this particular

675
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:03,920
iteration of a particular design and you

676
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,510
could only use that media block in a

677
00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:07,910
case where that was true and that's

678
00:25:07,910 --> 00:25:09,500
gonna be a really limited subset of

679
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:12,680
times so making the width be flexible is

680
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:16,700
super important as well we also want to

681
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:19,880
separate structure from chrome in the

682
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:21,740
top example it's a little hard to see

683
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:23,240
here there's a blue background and in

684
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:24,500
the bottom example there's a white

685
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:27,020
background we don't want to tie those

686
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:28,550
things together because then if we need

687
00:25:28,550 --> 00:25:30,170
to make a green one or whatever other

688
00:25:30,170 --> 00:25:32,480
color we would basically have to rewrite

689
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,580
all of the media block code and we don't

690
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:37,460
want to have to duplicate it so it's a

691
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:40,010
few lines of HTML this is the CSS

692
00:25:40,010 --> 00:25:41,510
example rather than the bootstrap

693
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:43,400
example they weren't basically the same

694
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,900
the class names are just a little bit

695
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:47,990
different and then it's just a few lines

696
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:50,870
of CSS as well really simple on the

697
00:25:50,870 --> 00:25:52,940
media there's a clear fix in this case

698
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:54,710
it's an overflow:hidden clear fix but it

699
00:25:54,710 --> 00:25:56,930
really could be anything I found out

700
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:59,720
from talking to now at CSS coffee you

701
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:02,210
that from Facebook that they're now

702
00:26:02,210 --> 00:26:04,460
using an overflow:hidden clear fix but

703
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:05,450
there are several different ways that

704
00:26:05,450 --> 00:26:07,670
you can do it and all of them again have

705
00:26:07,670 --> 00:26:09,980
positives and negatives good things

706
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:11,630
about them and things that are that are

707
00:26:11,630 --> 00:26:14,060
harder and that you have to work with so

708
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:15,590
then it's just some float left and float

709
00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:17,030
right and a little bit of margins to

710
00:26:17,030 --> 00:26:18,860
separate out your your images from the

711
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:20,990
content there next to I'm so pretty

712
00:26:20,990 --> 00:26:23,630
simple all in all and yet this is my

713
00:26:23,630 --> 00:26:25,150
this is my facebook stream

714
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:26,559
on the right-hand side I've highlighted

715
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:28,420
everywhere that they used a media block

716
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:31,300
in order to layout content and I made it

717
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:33,250
a partial opacity so you can see where

718
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:35,110
it's darker red that's basically where

719
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:36,730
they're nesting media blocks inside of

720
00:26:36,730 --> 00:26:39,240
each other so with just this one little

721
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:41,860
component it's pretty powerful and you

722
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:44,200
can you can actually do a whole bunch of

723
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:46,000
different kinds of layouts just with

724
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,940
this this one thing I think of it as one

725
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:50,350
of the most fundamental building blocks

726
00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:52,150
of the web because almost every site or

727
00:26:52,150 --> 00:26:54,809
app that I've worked on has one of these

728
00:26:54,809 --> 00:26:57,910
the Facebook HTML size reduced by about

729
00:26:57,910 --> 00:27:02,290
50% when they were working on this it's

730
00:27:02,290 --> 00:27:03,429
kind of interesting because a lot of

731
00:27:03,429 --> 00:27:04,840
people will say to me oh but you're

732
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:06,280
gonna have a lot of class names and your

733
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:07,990
HTML size it's gonna go up but

734
00:27:07,990 --> 00:27:09,820
consistently with the different clients

735
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:11,770
I've worked with I ate CML size actually

736
00:27:11,770 --> 00:27:14,230
goes down I think the reason is that

737
00:27:14,230 --> 00:27:15,880
sure you may have a case that's super

738
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:18,100
optimized where you have like oh I only

739
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:20,170
needed one link and I was able to put

740
00:27:20,170 --> 00:27:22,510
the icon in as a background image so you

741
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:25,480
only had to have that one that one node

742
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:28,110
in order to do it but the truth is that

743
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:30,760
usually if you have multiple ways of

744
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:32,800
coding the same component over and over

745
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:35,020
some may be coated really well and some

746
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:36,910
may be coated by a back-end developer

747
00:27:36,910 --> 00:27:38,530
who would really rather not be writing

748
00:27:38,530 --> 00:27:40,540
any CSS at all and who knows how they'll

749
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:41,620
end up doing it or how many nodes

750
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:43,690
they'll add so my feeling is that

751
00:27:43,690 --> 00:27:46,270
overall the size reduces because the

752
00:27:46,270 --> 00:27:49,090
consistency increases but that's you

753
00:27:49,090 --> 00:27:50,620
know sort of me making up a story around

754
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:53,200
it all I really know numbers-wise is

755
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,360
that it does reduce you know when you

756
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:58,660
when you componentize so what makes a

757
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:00,970
good component correct granularity is

758
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:04,000
really really important how do you solve

759
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,700
only one problem and solve it well when

760
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:07,840
which problem are you going to have

761
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:09,460
solved by this component which things

762
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:11,700
aren't you going to try and make it do

763
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:13,780
flexibility what don't you know

764
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:15,490
particularly width and height you want

765
00:28:15,490 --> 00:28:16,870
to let the content control your height

766
00:28:16,870 --> 00:28:18,970
and grids control your width rather than

767
00:28:18,970 --> 00:28:21,330
having individual components have sizes

768
00:28:21,330 --> 00:28:24,550
you want to keep your specificity low if

769
00:28:24,550 --> 00:28:25,360
you want to be able to combine

770
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,040
components it's really important to have

771
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:28,390
low specificity so they're not

772
00:28:28,390 --> 00:28:31,080
constantly overriding each other

773
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:33,460
encapsulation is important to which

774
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:35,110
nodes actually belong to this media

775
00:28:35,110 --> 00:28:36,730
block and which are just they happen to

776
00:28:36,730 --> 00:28:38,269
be children but they're not

777
00:28:38,269 --> 00:28:41,469
part of the media block itself and

778
00:28:41,469 --> 00:28:43,849
modularity and predictability as well

779
00:28:43,849 --> 00:28:45,200
the media block shouldn't behave

780
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,269
differently just because you put it into

781
00:28:47,269 --> 00:28:49,279
a different column or you put it into a

782
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:51,619
different page developers won't trust

783
00:28:51,619 --> 00:28:53,989
your code if they think that something

784
00:28:53,989 --> 00:28:56,929
may not behave the same way on different

785
00:28:56,929 --> 00:29:01,219
parts of the site so here's the the tile

786
00:29:01,219 --> 00:29:03,769
panel that we built and the designs for

787
00:29:03,769 --> 00:29:06,440
it it was sort of interesting I think

788
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:08,629
it's typical of designs and illustrator

789
00:29:08,629 --> 00:29:11,479
when we got it from the designer we

790
00:29:11,479 --> 00:29:14,929
noticed that the the icon and the text

791
00:29:14,929 --> 00:29:17,959
was always centered even when the footer

792
00:29:17,959 --> 00:29:19,519
showed and didn't show on hover and

793
00:29:19,519 --> 00:29:21,799
we're at first said oh goodness like how

794
00:29:21,799 --> 00:29:24,829
are we going to do that and we at first

795
00:29:24,829 --> 00:29:26,119
tried not to but it looked really bad

796
00:29:26,119 --> 00:29:29,089
you had a big gap under there when when

797
00:29:29,089 --> 00:29:31,309
the footer wasn't showing then we made

798
00:29:31,309 --> 00:29:32,570
it like a Plinko board where it just

799
00:29:32,570 --> 00:29:34,309
showed on hover like you know really

800
00:29:34,309 --> 00:29:36,079
fast and that didn't work either

801
00:29:36,079 --> 00:29:38,269
so iterating with the designer we were

802
00:29:38,269 --> 00:29:39,799
able to come up with an animation that

803
00:29:39,799 --> 00:29:43,129
showed the the footer slowly it faded in

804
00:29:43,129 --> 00:29:45,859
and faded out and the content rose up

805
00:29:45,859 --> 00:29:48,409
and rose down along with it something

806
00:29:48,409 --> 00:29:53,029
like a 300 millisecond animation and so

807
00:29:53,029 --> 00:29:54,619
by working with them and actually having

808
00:29:54,619 --> 00:29:56,599
them sit down and do design dev pairing

809
00:29:56,599 --> 00:29:58,729
we were able to get something that felt

810
00:29:58,729 --> 00:30:01,279
like it worked pretty well but without

811
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:02,959
having to have it specified to the ends

812
00:30:02,959 --> 00:30:05,539
degree I really hate the illustrator

813
00:30:05,539 --> 00:30:07,369
with the red line marks on it that say

814
00:30:07,369 --> 00:30:08,839
exactly how many pixels should be

815
00:30:08,839 --> 00:30:10,700
between this thing and that thing

816
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:13,070
it drives me crazy I don't think that we

817
00:30:13,070 --> 00:30:14,690
always know that and I think it's really

818
00:30:14,690 --> 00:30:17,559
hard to keep it consistent across pages

819
00:30:17,559 --> 00:30:19,639
there's no way to do a DIF of an

820
00:30:19,639 --> 00:30:21,440
illustrator file and to figure out that

821
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:23,209
oh whoops we used a slightly larger

822
00:30:23,209 --> 00:30:24,919
heading in this one or we've added an

823
00:30:24,919 --> 00:30:27,169
extra Pixlr to of space below this guy

824
00:30:27,169 --> 00:30:28,969
so I think it's much more important to

825
00:30:28,969 --> 00:30:30,440
define the default spacing for the

826
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:32,629
components and then put them together

827
00:30:32,629 --> 00:30:34,279
and let them let them sort of deal with

828
00:30:34,279 --> 00:30:38,479
themselves so we then did a sort of

829
00:30:38,479 --> 00:30:40,609
visual acceptance of the components so

830
00:30:40,609 --> 00:30:42,559
in the style guide context the PM the

831
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:45,249
design took time to review and

832
00:30:45,249 --> 00:30:47,509
independent of the individual page it

833
00:30:47,509 --> 00:30:49,700
was used on this felt really good to us

834
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:52,100
because we were struggling when we try

835
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:54,620
two views based CSS with ending up

836
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:56,330
calling things really specific stuff

837
00:30:56,330 --> 00:30:58,460
like it would it would be like the the

838
00:30:58,460 --> 00:31:00,890
marketing marketing footer and things

839
00:31:00,890 --> 00:31:02,240
like that and then we'd end up using it

840
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:03,679
on another page and it started to feel

841
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:05,390
weird because it wasn't a marketing page

842
00:31:05,390 --> 00:31:06,830
anymore they just happen to want to have

843
00:31:06,830 --> 00:31:09,770
the same footer so doing that acceptance

844
00:31:09,770 --> 00:31:12,110
independently helped us write cleaner

845
00:31:12,110 --> 00:31:15,860
more generic code so we converted the

846
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:18,830
marketing page first mainly because it

847
00:31:18,830 --> 00:31:21,320
got designed first and it was a little

848
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:24,860
more concrete because and mainly because

849
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:26,630
as well all the components for that page

850
00:31:26,630 --> 00:31:29,059
got done first we really wanted to start

851
00:31:29,059 --> 00:31:31,460
converting pages as soon as possible

852
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:32,900
because we were afraid the PM would pull

853
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:34,370
the plug on the project if we took too

854
00:31:34,370 --> 00:31:36,230
long and so we wanted him to start to

855
00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:38,570
see project progress and to see that we

856
00:31:38,570 --> 00:31:41,030
were getting somewhere so we basically

857
00:31:41,030 --> 00:31:43,250
then at a story once we'd done the

858
00:31:43,250 --> 00:31:44,870
stories for all the components for that

859
00:31:44,870 --> 00:31:45,440
page

860
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,360
we had another story which was implement

861
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:49,340
the marketplace page design with

862
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:54,110
components it was it was quite cool to

863
00:31:54,110 --> 00:31:56,030
get a story like this because once we

864
00:31:56,030 --> 00:31:57,830
had all the components together it was

865
00:31:57,830 --> 00:32:00,470
like hooking up Legos and you know we

866
00:32:00,470 --> 00:32:01,760
would put all the components together

867
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:05,090
and in basically a plain HTML or plain

868
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:08,000
Hamel document with lorem ipsum in it

869
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,919
and then we separated out actually

870
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:11,570
hooking up the backend and hooking up

871
00:32:11,570 --> 00:32:13,520
the data side of things and doing that

872
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:15,710
again in two steps helped it to be

873
00:32:15,710 --> 00:32:18,020
faster and cleaner especially for the

874
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:19,580
developers who weren't as familiar with

875
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:21,440
component systems they got a chance to

876
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,480
just figure out components not have to

877
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:25,130
do that along with figuring out hooking

878
00:32:25,130 --> 00:32:27,530
up the data and from my side where I'm

879
00:32:27,530 --> 00:32:29,299
less familiar with back-end it was great

880
00:32:29,299 --> 00:32:31,340
because I got to do the hooking of the

881
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:33,110
data side without having to also think

882
00:32:33,110 --> 00:32:35,000
about whether I'd properly indented my

883
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,950
panel and that kind of stuff all that

884
00:32:36,950 --> 00:32:41,000
was solved ahead of time we had feature

885
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,500
flags for all of this so that we could

886
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:45,110
still regularly deploy usually we like

887
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:47,059
to do incremental deploys but in this

888
00:32:47,059 --> 00:32:48,710
case it was just such a big change that

889
00:32:48,710 --> 00:32:50,630
we couldn't have some one page of the

890
00:32:50,630 --> 00:32:52,250
site be green and another page of the

891
00:32:52,250 --> 00:32:54,950
site or all the other pages be blue so

892
00:32:54,950 --> 00:32:56,570
we decided to feature flag the whole

893
00:32:56,570 --> 00:32:59,840
thing and do one big giant deploy I'm

894
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:01,549
sort of considering that incremental

895
00:33:01,549 --> 00:33:04,070
release or the big bang approach and I

896
00:33:04,070 --> 00:33:05,510
like incremental release

897
00:33:05,510 --> 00:33:07,010
I think it's a lot easier to be sure

898
00:33:07,010 --> 00:33:08,210
you're not doing something crazy or

899
00:33:08,210 --> 00:33:10,370
users are going to hate but in this case

900
00:33:10,370 --> 00:33:11,900
it wouldn't it wouldn't work for us with

901
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:15,530
the constraints of time that we had so

902
00:33:15,530 --> 00:33:16,790
the thing that we were trying to do more

903
00:33:16,790 --> 00:33:18,320
than anything was to make an unsightly

904
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:20,870
clean spot and this is something that a

905
00:33:20,870 --> 00:33:22,370
friend of mine came up with years ago

906
00:33:22,370 --> 00:33:25,400
when he loved to restore old cars and he

907
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,600
would talk about when he'd gotten a

908
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:29,060
really junky old car and he would clean

909
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:31,550
part of it and how just cleaning that

910
00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:33,770
part made such a contrast so that you

911
00:33:33,770 --> 00:33:35,390
could actually see how dirty and how

912
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:37,640
much attention and time other parts of

913
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:40,060
the antique car needed to bring it up to

914
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:43,970
to restored condition and so we kind of

915
00:33:43,970 --> 00:33:45,500
did that with our site we had some

916
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:48,260
pretty messy code it felt pretty

917
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:50,480
overwhelming and a bunch of people had

918
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:52,070
sort of tried to start getting things

919
00:33:52,070 --> 00:33:53,810
cleaner and it no one had gotten

920
00:33:53,810 --> 00:33:56,120
traction our velocity was super low and

921
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:58,910
we just weren't getting things done and

922
00:33:58,910 --> 00:34:00,770
so then we decided the unsightly clean

923
00:34:00,770 --> 00:34:02,420
spot approach we weren't gonna try to

924
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:05,030
get everything better we were just gonna

925
00:34:05,030 --> 00:34:06,500
focus on getting the front end code

926
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:08,540
better just gonna focus on components

927
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:09,950
and we're gonna completely ignore the

928
00:34:09,950 --> 00:34:12,110
Ruby for a while and once we did that

929
00:34:12,110 --> 00:34:14,240
and we actually made an unsightly clean

930
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:16,909
spot we could see oh wow that's the Ruby

931
00:34:16,909 --> 00:34:18,620
our endpoints are not working for us

932
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:20,659
because we need we actually need this in

933
00:34:20,659 --> 00:34:21,980
the front end and we're not getting it

934
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:24,500
in the way that we need so I think it's

935
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:26,510
actually a pretty good way of starting

936
00:34:26,510 --> 00:34:29,419
to starting to clean up a messy code

937
00:34:29,419 --> 00:34:32,179
bases don't try to like spread your your

938
00:34:32,179 --> 00:34:34,250
refactoring around the entire code base

939
00:34:34,250 --> 00:34:37,159
evenly focus it on one bit and like

940
00:34:37,159 --> 00:34:39,770
really get that bit making sense I think

941
00:34:39,770 --> 00:34:45,990
at least for us that worked really well

942
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,760
so when converting a page first we

943
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,590
created the layout with the static

944
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:53,270
components and then second we wired up

945
00:34:53,270 --> 00:34:55,340
the page to the back-end dynamic content

946
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:57,139
so we would end up with something like

947
00:34:57,139 --> 00:35:00,680
this where we had a Hamel but it you

948
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:03,590
know was all basically first lorem ipsum

949
00:35:03,590 --> 00:35:05,270
and then we would actually hook it up to

950
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:07,340
our endpoints and get our you know

951
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:09,110
service offering names and descriptions

952
00:35:09,110 --> 00:35:13,430
and things like that once we finally had

953
00:35:13,430 --> 00:35:15,650
put together everything so we had we had

954
00:35:15,650 --> 00:35:17,810
all the components we had the page done

955
00:35:17,810 --> 00:35:18,589
with we

956
00:35:18,589 --> 00:35:20,029
components and then we had all the data

957
00:35:20,029 --> 00:35:22,039
hooked up then we did another stage of

958
00:35:22,039 --> 00:35:23,539
acceptance where our p.m. would look at

959
00:35:23,539 --> 00:35:25,339
the actual page and test all the flows

960
00:35:25,339 --> 00:35:27,319
and make sure they made sense as well I

961
00:35:27,319 --> 00:35:28,969
would give design a chance to look at

962
00:35:28,969 --> 00:35:32,359
the entire page in in its context and

963
00:35:32,359 --> 00:35:33,920
make sure that the decisions we'd made

964
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:36,410
in the in the microcosm of a particular

965
00:35:36,410 --> 00:35:37,999
component actually made sense when they

966
00:35:37,999 --> 00:35:42,079
were blown up to a page level design dev

967
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:44,660
pairing was amazing for this we got to

968
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:46,460
do refinements we got to do animation

969
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:48,710
timing and interactions it just wasn't

970
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:50,390
possible to communicate that in static

971
00:35:50,390 --> 00:35:53,359
mock-ups Adobe products are really tough

972
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:55,729
for for anything where you want to

973
00:35:55,729 --> 00:35:57,380
communicate about how something changes

974
00:35:57,380 --> 00:36:00,910
over time or or anything like that so we

975
00:36:00,910 --> 00:36:03,469
found that it was much better to do a

976
00:36:03,469 --> 00:36:06,589
rough version in pure HTML with just

977
00:36:06,589 --> 00:36:08,509
some basic design feedback and then

978
00:36:08,509 --> 00:36:10,759
actually sit with the designer and do it

979
00:36:10,759 --> 00:36:13,670
together and then we discovered our

980
00:36:13,670 --> 00:36:15,140
designer could code as well which was a

981
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:17,960
fantastic thing to find out now we're

982
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:19,910
making him code all the time

983
00:36:19,910 --> 00:36:22,670
so we all scented color and spacing

984
00:36:22,670 --> 00:36:23,960
tweaks when they didn't match the

985
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:26,450
mock-ups so sometimes he do things like

986
00:36:26,450 --> 00:36:29,660
change the background color when you

987
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:31,460
know normal iterations right he had used

988
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:33,170
a pretty dark grey kind of a battleship

989
00:36:33,170 --> 00:36:35,089
gray for our background and it really

990
00:36:35,089 --> 00:36:37,130
looked cool but in a bunch of cases with

991
00:36:37,130 --> 00:36:38,359
different content and didn't work very

992
00:36:38,359 --> 00:36:40,789
well so slowly over time he'd lightened

993
00:36:40,789 --> 00:36:42,619
it in the mock-ups but we didn't realize

994
00:36:42,619 --> 00:36:44,930
so in design death pairing he would pick

995
00:36:44,930 --> 00:36:46,190
up things like that and say oh you

996
00:36:46,190 --> 00:36:47,779
didn't notice I'd lightened this we need

997
00:36:47,779 --> 00:36:49,489
to change the gray that's the background

998
00:36:49,489 --> 00:36:55,640
of our our page and so more sort of

999
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:57,589
mushy results like less numbers based

1000
00:36:57,589 --> 00:36:59,420
but I think just as important if not

1001
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:01,969
more important we now have no view

1002
00:37:01,969 --> 00:37:04,489
specific CSS at all it's it's completely

1003
00:37:04,489 --> 00:37:07,519
gone making making changes to the CSS

1004
00:37:07,519 --> 00:37:09,680
isn't terrifying anymore I mean I have

1005
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:11,779
like 10 years or 13 years of experience

1006
00:37:11,779 --> 00:37:14,539
writing CSS and the CSS that we had in

1007
00:37:14,539 --> 00:37:16,279
the beginning I didn't dare change it I

1008
00:37:16,279 --> 00:37:17,359
felt like I was going to break

1009
00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:19,460
everything if I touched it anywhere

1010
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:21,079
nevermind people who were just getting

1011
00:37:21,079 --> 00:37:22,549
out of college or who had done back end

1012
00:37:22,549 --> 00:37:24,619
and hadn't done a lot of front end it

1013
00:37:24,619 --> 00:37:26,059
was really rough

1014
00:37:26,059 --> 00:37:28,430
and so now changing our CSS you know

1015
00:37:28,430 --> 00:37:30,079
exactly what's going to change as a

1016
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:30,710
result

1017
00:37:30,710 --> 00:37:33,040
the scope is a lot easier to determine

1018
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:35,450
all of the components are in the style

1019
00:37:35,450 --> 00:37:36,950
guide which in terms of a testing

1020
00:37:36,950 --> 00:37:38,960
strategy has worked out really well it

1021
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:40,430
means that when we add a new component

1022
00:37:40,430 --> 00:37:42,080
we can check the style guide rather than

1023
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:43,790
having to check every page of the entire

1024
00:37:43,790 --> 00:37:47,270
site and that has been really super in

1025
00:37:47,270 --> 00:37:49,400
terms of having I spent less time on

1026
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:50,630
testing and more time actually getting

1027
00:37:50,630 --> 00:37:53,690
features out there way fewer partials

1028
00:37:53,690 --> 00:37:55,820
it's possible to actually tell what's

1029
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:57,350
going on in a page because we made

1030
00:37:57,350 --> 00:37:59,750
sensible partials when something was

1031
00:37:59,750 --> 00:38:01,640
reused we made it into a partial when it

1032
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:04,430
wasn't we didn't and that has been

1033
00:38:04,430 --> 00:38:07,730
that's been pretty helpful oh we got rid

1034
00:38:07,730 --> 00:38:10,730
of jQuery UI and bootstrap too which is

1035
00:38:10,730 --> 00:38:12,950
fantastic I think one framework is

1036
00:38:12,950 --> 00:38:15,170
enough for anybody and we did not need

1037
00:38:15,170 --> 00:38:17,810
to have so many hanging around and more

1038
00:38:17,810 --> 00:38:19,190
importantly maybe for the user the

1039
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:20,870
design is consistent and now when the

1040
00:38:20,870 --> 00:38:22,400
designer wants to change something like

1041
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,870
he just came up with a new design for

1042
00:38:23,870 --> 00:38:26,480
all of the buttons we can do that and we

1043
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:27,410
can do that quickly

1044
00:38:27,410 --> 00:38:29,600
you know that's now in our story instead

1045
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:33,980
of a multi-day or possibly week story so

1046
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:36,140
before when people were starting a new

1047
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:37,250
story the question they were asking

1048
00:38:37,250 --> 00:38:39,920
himself was what markup and CSS do I

1049
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,630
need to write now when they're starting

1050
00:38:41,630 --> 00:38:43,310
a new story they say which components is

1051
00:38:43,310 --> 00:38:45,320
this page made of and that's a really

1052
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:47,720
fantastic change that's that's made a

1053
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:50,060
huge difference in terms of how we work

1054
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:51,320
together and how much fun we're having

1055
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:53,420
building things not wasting time

1056
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:54,980
reinventing the wheel but instead

1057
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:57,320
spending our time making the stuff

1058
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:58,580
that's really going to make the product

1059
00:38:58,580 --> 00:39:00,680
different and innovative and you know

1060
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:01,850
building the new thing instead of

1061
00:39:01,850 --> 00:39:03,790
building the old things over and over
