1
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:37,579

hey jay is calm how are you doing how's

2
00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:41,230
the wife i holding up all right awesome

3
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:44,390
so yeah welcome to our presentation on

4
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:47,239
conference Wi-Fi redux we're going to

5
00:00:47,239 --> 00:00:50,390
talk about how we try to you know fix

6
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:52,129
this Wi-Fi problem that you sometimes

7
00:00:52,129 --> 00:00:55,339
have a conferences let's start with a

8
00:00:55,339 --> 00:00:59,329
quick introduction of us to so this is

9
00:00:59,329 --> 00:01:02,030
me know you might know him from on

10
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:04,580
Twitter as fast and fearless as a you

11
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:08,119
know there's this you know a friend of

12
00:01:08,119 --> 00:01:09,590
him once described him it's the only

13
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:11,840
person in the world that can enter you

14
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,840
in a revolving door one spot behind you

15
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:19,130
and can exit before you so be aware of

16
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:22,009
this guy and I'm not so and thanks for

17
00:01:22,009 --> 00:01:23,930
Brendan for the introduction so let's

18
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:27,350
start with a short voting who in this

19
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:30,770
room has one Wi-Fi device attached to

20
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:37,490
the network how about two how about

21
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:48,860
three anybody 45 the palm guy everyone

22
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:58,780
nice awesome so yeah right so I mean

23
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:01,760
Wi-Fi on conference is likely to break

24
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,830
right so we actually made two

25
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:07,430
presentations this web page right so we

26
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:09,590
can now click on the on the right one

27
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:12,560
and we basically choose between

28
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,060
everything's already not not really

29
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:17,750
working the you know if you're very

30
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:20,030
familiar with us you know where the

31
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:23,840
photo on the left happened and but I

32
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,849
kind of get the feeling we're in the

33
00:02:25,849 --> 00:02:28,189
better than dojo department right now so

34
00:02:28,189 --> 00:02:33,049
let's do that yeah we have a story to

35
00:02:33,049 --> 00:02:35,420
tell about conferences Wi-Fi of course

36
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:39,319
it's very hard to make these first of

37
00:02:39,319 --> 00:02:41,749
all it is absolutely temporary it's the

38
00:02:41,749 --> 00:02:43,669
setup which made for two or three days

39
00:02:43,669 --> 00:02:45,350
so you have to bring in

40
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:46,910
everything and you have to pick out

41
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:49,430
everything and you don't know exactly

42
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:52,310
how the setup on the location are

43
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:55,750
working so it's tough first of all

44
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:58,460
what's with the backbone so you have no

45
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:00,800
cables installed we in this in this

46
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,040
location we have but in general we

47
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,690
didn't had so we have to build a

48
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:08,780
backbone by on our own and secondary of

49
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:11,150
course then the Wi-Fi of course the

50
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:13,940
frequency stuff is coming up and we have

51
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:16,460
to build a coverage of all the Wi-Fi

52
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:20,480
spots and it should work all around the

53
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:24,530
area and this is usually done in longer

54
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:27,500
set up in commercial environments out of

55
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:32,150
these it is a very complicated thing to

56
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:34,400
think about a conference set up of

57
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,660
course you you are crowded you are

58
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:37,220
sitting in one room there are a lot of

59
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:39,460
people you need a lot of bandwidth and

60
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:42,320
first of all you read what's on the

61
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:45,680
Wi-Fi technical things and you get its

62
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,510
imagine there's enough bandwidth in the

63
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:50,510
air but that's only terror ethically in

64
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:53,810
practical you have we discovered we

65
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:56,780
don't get more than 220 megabits through

66
00:03:56,780 --> 00:04:01,730
a room and this this sounds affordable

67
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:05,590
and much but it isn't and all of these

68
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:09,620
we also learned that the bandwidth in

69
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:12,800
the air is one thing but there are a lot

70
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:17,060
of other things to do with the back end

71
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:20,989
and the connections to oust outside

72
00:04:20,989 --> 00:04:24,470
world and the internet and out of these

73
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:28,100
we had a couple of strange things

74
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:29,690
discovered with the usage pattern

75
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:31,580
usually we would like to say okay it's

76
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:35,510
just HTTP traffic but it isn't at all so

77
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:39,080
that's all learnings we had and all of

78
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:43,610
these we try to solve these right so

79
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:45,740
basically in Berlin the situation worse

80
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:47,660
we was at these you know really nice

81
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:50,420
lofty industrial building if the problem

82
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:51,440
was it didn't have an internet

83
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,500
connection so you know we basically went

84
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:57,260
the route of taking whatever you can get

85
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:58,820
right so we enter

86
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:01,610
with two like microwave radio directed

87
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:04,280
radio up links to the internet and then

88
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:07,130
we also bought for dsl consumer lines

89
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:09,770
which as you might know especially in

90
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:11,720
Europe there are a synchronous they have

91
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,550
much more downstream bandwidth a nap

92
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:18,380
streets bandwidth right and what you do

93
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:21,680
is you do load balancing right so you

94
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:25,730
all those lines and and you know how do

95
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:27,500
you get the traffic across yeah that's

96
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:33,680
uh that's let's load balancing yes and

97
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,980
how do how do you done that of course

98
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:39,440
it's similar to http but it's it's in

99
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,810
Reverse style so we have a link

100
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:46,040
aggregation facility which is means okay

101
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:48,380
on a web server the requests are coming

102
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:50,510
in from the internet and they are spread

103
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:52,880
it out of your server cloud or server

104
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,550
farm and what we does is a different one

105
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:56,960
of course we get the packets from the

106
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,640
conference and we have to spread it out

107
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,590
over the pipes we have to the internet

108
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:03,770
so and then we have to rejoin them on

109
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:06,230
the other part in the internet so this

110
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:08,870
is done with link aggregation and it's

111
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:10,370
happening in both directions so it's

112
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,320
inbound and outbound traffic which we

113
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:15,770
are observe all of these that the

114
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:18,170
connections are as a matrix so there's a

115
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:20,510
lot of things to do we think this is the

116
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:22,220
first implementation of this kind so we

117
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:24,440
you know there's several other packages

118
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:26,180
around that do this but we didn't really

119
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:29,450
find one so um it might be the first and

120
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:32,240
the good thing on it it is JavaScript

121
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:36,800
and it is written in node so so it's

122
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,780
matt all traffic running over a node or

123
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:44,000
what could go wrong right yeah awesome

124
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,430
so we're introducing what we call

125
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:50,960
sashimi sashimi is a packet knife and

126
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,990
it's written it's using the colonel tune

127
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:58,310
interface which is exposing IP

128
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:00,050
interfaces for the traffic on your

129
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:02,690
external interfaces to user land and

130
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:04,730
what that gives you and this is like the

131
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:07,010
main part of sashimi it gives you a note

132
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:10,600
api to do userland javascript level IP

133
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,330
stuff you

134
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:14,639
no we use it for link aggregation but

135
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:16,139
you could do all kinds of things and you

136
00:07:16,139 --> 00:07:18,240
could also use it for like packet

137
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,069
inspection packet inspection all kind of

138
00:07:20,069 --> 00:07:21,780
higher-level things that could be done

139
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:23,819
in JavaScript and which you know you

140
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:25,710
don't want to do and see if you're a

141
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:28,770
Java confer ins and to explain what what

142
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:32,159
what what sashimi is doing it's

143
00:07:32,159 --> 00:07:36,330
basically using HTTPS TCP streams on

144
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:39,210
those various connections and is sending

145
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:41,250
IP traffic though whether it's tcp UDP

146
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:44,639
whatever over those TCP streams so we're

147
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:48,690
doing IP over tcp/ip between the both

148
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:54,120
sides we need to go deeper yeah um right

149
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:57,030
so this this very uncomplicated picture

150
00:07:57,030 --> 00:07:59,370
kind of explains the situation we had in

151
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:02,099
Berlin so up there is the guy in the

152
00:08:02,099 --> 00:08:05,069
conference and down here is the internet

153
00:08:05,069 --> 00:08:08,330
where you can download kittens right so

154
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:12,389
there's two sashimi processes one is

155
00:08:12,389 --> 00:08:14,250
running inside the conference the other

156
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:16,560
one is running outside the conference

157
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,690
some were also at the conference so we

158
00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:21,719
had on the left-hand side those radio

159
00:08:21,719 --> 00:08:23,940
links two of them and on the right side

160
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:26,460
our dsl connections so we actually

161
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:28,680
decided that because the dsl connections

162
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,750
have so little upstream bandwidth we

163
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:32,279
don't want to use it at all for user

164
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:34,140
traffic we just use it for the

165
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:36,959
confirmation packages in tcp/ip so what

166
00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:39,570
you see up there is from the upper to

167
00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:42,300
see me the links going out all outgoing

168
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:44,190
traffic all outgoing traffic is going

169
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:46,199
through the microwave links and it's

170
00:08:46,199 --> 00:08:47,910
coming back and it's you know the the

171
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:49,649
traffic lens and the sashimi you

172
00:08:49,649 --> 00:08:52,050
download the kitten so you have the

173
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:56,279
returning TCP IP packet and right now

174
00:08:56,279 --> 00:08:59,160
we're using all our links for the return

175
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:01,860
so it might very well happen and I go

176
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:05,250
out of the camera but I have to it's

177
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:07,380
that you know your packet is here and it

178
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,540
might always come through here but it

179
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:11,850
might go actually back through the dsl

180
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:14,010
connections so you can give full load

181
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:16,079
balancing and what we have those

182
00:09:16,079 --> 00:09:17,970
multiple lines because we actually we

183
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:20,130
open for TCP streams on these

184
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:22,800
connections and two on these and then we

185
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,260
do round-robin load balancing on them so

186
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:26,220
that you get choices

187
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:27,990
much traffic back through the microwave

188
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:30,120
links then we see through the dsl

189
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:36,480
connections and it worked yeah of course

190
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,190
we are on the technical conference so we

191
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:42,240
need some code and the this is about the

192
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,490
packet packet streaming protocol it's a

193
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:47,580
general protocol that it's mad just have

194
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:49,680
the header which say okay the packet

195
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,720
will be half the size of thousands bite

196
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:54,210
and then the packet is transmitted and

197
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:56,250
in general this is the code which is

198
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:58,920
running in sushi me which receives data

199
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:02,640
somehow and are further on it it

200
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,580
receives the header and then the packet

201
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:07,170
and then a header and then the packet

202
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:09,630
that's why these active switches

203
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:13,230
happening there and the QA at call does

204
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:16,230
we will have a further look to later on

205
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:18,780
the next slide or to it it does just

206
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:20,850
collecting the incoming data of course

207
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:22,890
the TCP fragments could be different to

208
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:25,350
the sizes of the packets so the colds

209
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:28,530
which are coming in are given to the

210
00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:30,750
queue ad and the queue ID say okay I now

211
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:32,340
receive four byte for example for the

212
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:34,170
Harrow and then it calls a call back

213
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:36,390
header complete and had a complete just

214
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:38,850
switch around and sets a packet length

215
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:40,980
for the next packet and then the packet

216
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:44,520
will be received so with so the

217
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:47,550
synchronization on a stream with a

218
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:54,120
packet is established in somehow the the

219
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:59,660
whole code is not much longer than these

220
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:02,460
it's a little bit tweaking around with

221
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:05,280
buffers and having some offset

222
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:08,340
calculation of the incoming buffers and

223
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:11,190
dust of the callbacks to all these

224
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:13,830
things so what you say you drop in their

225
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:16,950
data and use wait for 4 bytes and like

226
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:19,290
the the Kohlberg is issued this might be

227
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:21,330
a little hard to read but you know may

228
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:22,950
know he's one of those guys he doesn't

229
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:25,650
like semicolons and but I made him put

230
00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:29,190
them in there so maybe we can get some

231
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:34,860
learnings always anyway yeah nice so we

232
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:37,440
talked about this one problem that is

233
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,720
that you know you

234
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,610
kind of have those different connections

235
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:44,009
and you solve it right so we experienced

236
00:11:44,009 --> 00:11:45,720
that other problem many was talking

237
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,879
about that earlier and that is that

238
00:11:47,879 --> 00:11:49,860
people sometimes do weird things on the

239
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:52,920
conference Wi-Fi and you you wouldn't

240
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:55,319
really expect that it's it's you know

241
00:11:55,319 --> 00:11:57,720
your backup your stuff and what and

242
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,370
we're experiment that's actually right

243
00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:01,589
now people do have backup agents running

244
00:12:01,589 --> 00:12:03,360
on their computer and they're constantly

245
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,639
pushing traffic into the internet which

246
00:12:05,639 --> 00:12:07,170
is you know absolutely different from

247
00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:08,370
what you would expect from somebody

248
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:12,000
checking trigger right so what happens

249
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:19,050
is we experience this congestion and you

250
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:20,339
know what what do you do if you get

251
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:22,889
congestion right so on the first day has

252
00:12:22,889 --> 00:12:24,629
come for you Mina was sitting in this

253
00:12:24,629 --> 00:12:27,660
corner the whole time and was inspecting

254
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:29,910
target IP addresses trying to block them

255
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:31,800
so what we experienced actually two

256
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:34,139
weeks ago is that basically ninety

257
00:12:34,139 --> 00:12:35,939
percent of the interent runs on amazon

258
00:12:35,939 --> 00:12:39,540
right so once you discover that those

259
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:41,310
guys are all backing up their stuff to

260
00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:43,110
amazon and then you decide to block

261
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:45,180
amazon you block the internet basically

262
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:49,379
right so you can't do that so and you

263
00:12:49,379 --> 00:12:52,620
know it's 2011 right so what do you do

264
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:56,730
if things are broke you know you need to

265
00:12:56,730 --> 00:13:00,180
add more social to the experience so you

266
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:03,389
might have noticed that you guys had to

267
00:13:03,389 --> 00:13:05,730
make a twitter or lost connection to get

268
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:09,360
on the Wi-Fi so and we were pretty clear

269
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,250
about on the page what this means that

270
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:13,350
means that you guys aren't anonymous

271
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:16,410
anymore right if we see that one of you

272
00:13:16,410 --> 00:13:18,180
guys is sending our huge amounts of

273
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:20,370
traffic through the internet we're going

274
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:22,649
to come back to you and tell you please

275
00:13:22,649 --> 00:13:24,660
stop because before that we just end up

276
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:26,850
here address we didn't know who it is so

277
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:31,740
now we know right and so coming from

278
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:34,350
this we actually you know we have all

279
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:35,670
this data and its associated with

280
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:37,790
twitter names you can do fancy things

281
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:40,559
like on the next page you must forget

282
00:13:40,559 --> 00:13:41,620
google

283
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:45,730
he does obviously he does I didn't

284
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:50,430
mention that on purpose and I helped him

285
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:54,700
right so he's the evil guy I'm just he's

286
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:58,300
a good guy I'm just a search engine okay

287
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:03,190
so let's look at this um here it doesn't

288
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:05,350
start out to be very fancy so this is an

289
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:06,820
application that we call social traffic

290
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:09,220
occasionally see it now at social desh

291
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:12,250
traffic streaming org and the first

292
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:14,290
graph is showing the you the overall

293
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:16,779
traffic that went through the pipes of

294
00:14:16,779 --> 00:14:18,730
this conference throughout the time

295
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:20,860
right can you move on to the second

296
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:24,070
graph yes this is showing you the short

297
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:25,420
term traffic so this is actually the

298
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:27,850
last three minutes what went through the

299
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:30,120
pipes it's kind of a weird unit it's

300
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:33,820
bytes per 10 minutes but it doesn't

301
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:35,980
really matter right so moving further

302
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:40,660
down we see actual twitter names

303
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:43,900
associated with the traffic that they

304
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:46,750
pursued and it's very interesting stay

305
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:48,459
on top seven tops and okay that's it

306
00:14:48,459 --> 00:14:50,529
bound traffic I want to go to no no go

307
00:14:50,529 --> 00:14:53,170
to the go there because there's a new

308
00:14:53,170 --> 00:14:55,750
thing yeah because you know fast and

309
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:57,670
feelings and cramp oh sorry Niles right

310
00:14:57,670 --> 00:15:00,120
we were on position one because we were

311
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:03,339
you know we were testing this but who is

312
00:15:03,339 --> 00:15:08,560
jas john st ooh bad guy bad guy way to

313
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:15,910
go no no no what did you do demos it's a

314
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:20,560
pretty good excuse you uploaded 1 point

315
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,920
3 gigabytes of demos to the Internet

316
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:30,250
awesome do that let's let's go to the

317
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:34,180
outbound traffic so you see all the

318
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:36,339
names are in that it's a long list it's

319
00:15:36,339 --> 00:15:39,790
around 260 users we discovered and talk

320
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:43,150
about little how we go this so whenever

321
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:45,490
you go through the signup oh oh you out

322
00:15:45,490 --> 00:15:49,540
first so it's fine you're still the

323
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:51,640
first are awesome it's this outgoing or

324
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:55,150
in bond inbound honestly

325
00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:57,310
so let's talk about how this works so

326
00:15:57,310 --> 00:15:59,080
you know you go through the signup

327
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:02,170
process we open up iptables for your mac

328
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:06,040
address and store in a couch to be what

329
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:08,170
you know what you're always token is

330
00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:10,120
what your trigger idea is with your name

331
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:13,090
and then you know we get those flow

332
00:16:13,090 --> 00:16:15,880
packages flow files from the firewall

333
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:18,850
and we associate them back with your

334
00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:21,280
true name and write all of that into a

335
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,750
culture be so don't worry about it we

336
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:24,580
don't you know we don't actually store

337
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:27,580
the payload data which would be kind of

338
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:29,380
hard but we do store the amounts of

339
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:30,850
bytes that you're sending in and out of

340
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:32,890
the internet he's a good guy from google

341
00:16:32,890 --> 00:16:36,190
right so we are really then we resync

342
00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:38,140
that database outside of the conference

343
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:41,170
to a data center using couch to be

344
00:16:41,170 --> 00:16:43,330
replication and this application is

345
00:16:43,330 --> 00:16:45,370
actually just the HTML file that's

346
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:47,980
looking at the data it's on github you

347
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:50,530
get the URL later and you might have

348
00:16:50,530 --> 00:16:52,540
other fine ideas what you could do with

349
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:56,350
that data if you get it yeah you were

350
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:59,650
like I wanted to see others people right

351
00:16:59,650 --> 00:17:03,220
so spoon so this was this thing you know

352
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:04,810
what we didn't show you it is you can

353
00:17:04,810 --> 00:17:07,300
actually click those names I can do that

354
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:10,810
and then you will see in the graph of

355
00:17:10,810 --> 00:17:12,430
course I switch off the OL and all

356
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:15,610
inbound and all outbound traffic oh I'm

357
00:17:15,610 --> 00:17:18,640
one too high he doesn't it Oh where's

358
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:23,350
I'm gone maybe it broke it broke no it

359
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:28,240
doesn't it doesn't I don't know

360
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,950
interesting it's interesting I see so

361
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:36,760
many else maybe spoon is evil what's up

362
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:39,580
with this guy that's me it's also gone

363
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:43,440
gone so we are not here so the things

364
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,450
right it's probably the couch to be that

365

the internet please check your internet

374
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:32,830

could he is a good guy I'm the bad one

376
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:39,760
of course so we flipped a coin and we

377
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,400
decided not to we should still do this

378
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:45,130
world record maybe if when everybody is

384
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:01,660
these stuff first of all it's a bit

385
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:03,700
pre-alpha no it's not pre-alpha it's

386
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:05,560
tailor-made for conferences like these

387
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:07,960
so you cannot stand it but don't expect

388
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:10,120
that is completely done and everything

389
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:12,820
is in the first of all sushime is on my

390
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:14,980
github account and the social traffic

391
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:18,580

his mom and we are would be it would be

393
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:24,520
nice if we get some pull requests for

394
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:26,950
the social traffic stuff or sashimi are

395
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:29,680
we will integrate that and we will see

396
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:32,590
where it's working the next time there

397
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:35,440
are a lot of ideas to do with a to deal

398
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,720
with all these information it's really

399
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:40,300
interesting once you have traffic and

400
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:42,460
identity you can do interesting self

401
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:45,820
with it and you know who knows what's

402
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:49,780
going to happen yes thank you that's it

403
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:56,080
there are there are any questions

404
00:19:56,090 --> 00:19:58,950
this is this is the on the plane that

405
00:19:58,950 --> 00:20:02,700
the test set up of course on the plane

406
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:05,190
you John don't that you don't allow to

407
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:08,090
enable the Wi-Fi so we choose the cable

408
00:20:08,090 --> 00:20:16,890
and it works okay we're here for for the

409
00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:20,429
Wi-Fi access points are where we have a

410
00:20:20,429 --> 00:20:24,419
lot of hardware the the hardware here

411
00:20:24,419 --> 00:20:27,570
around is from all we didn't install it

412
00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:29,700
here but Wright the actual Wi-Fi routers

413
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:33,809
are delivered by a vendor so it's not

414
00:20:33,809 --> 00:20:36,750
our business Germany we will have x up x

415
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:41,750
own and so there's a foxconn computer

416
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:43,919
you probably know more about it you're

417
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:45,600
earning inside this conference it's a

418
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,309
very small system which which just

419
00:20:47,309 --> 00:20:48,870
collecting the idea and to just the

420
00:20:48,870 --> 00:20:53,520
backbone Rajan that's all another

421
00:20:53,520 --> 00:21:00,950
