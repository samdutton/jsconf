1
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:24,790
I'm Mathias.

2
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:27,220
I live in sunny Copenhagen.

3
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:29,369
Also known as Mafintosh.

4
00:00:29,369 --> 00:00:34,860
That is the way to get in touch with me.

5
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:46,030
We are going to talk about 3 things today.

6
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:52,390
Javascript, bittorrent and a little bit of
mad science.

7
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:53,390
Stag Vm represent.

8
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:54,390
Whoe.

9
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:55,390
All right.

10
00:00:55,390 --> 00:01:01,440
So, we are on a tight schedule.

11
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,890
We are going to dive straight into it.

12
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:06,170
What is bittorrent?

13
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:09,000
How does it work?

14
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,040
How many people have heard about Bittorrent?

15
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:15,390
All right.

16
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:19,590
Usually when I ask this question, what is
bittorrent?

17
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:25,950
People tend to think this one thing.

18
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:28,140
Which is not completely untrue.

19
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:29,610
It is a bit sad.

20
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:35,140
Actually bittorrent is just like way more
than this.

21
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:37,460
Application is way beyond piracy.

22
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:44,200
So, yeah, let's talk about how it works.

23
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:48,690
Normally when you fetch a file online it could
be any file.

24
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:50,790
Video of this talk.

25
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:57,030
You have the scenario where you have a server
and you trust this server and you go to the

26
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:00,119
server and do send me this file.

27
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:01,830
Yes, here is the file.

28
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:05,110
It is kind of nice.

29
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:07,620
It is super simple and nice.

30
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:11,040
A diagram with 2 things on it.

31
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:13,190
Awesome.

32
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:15,190
What's the problem?

33
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:20,060
Well, what happens when 1 million clients
come in.

34
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:23,160
We want to watch the video.

35
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:29,510
I don't know if you saw the Apple keynote.

36
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:37,020
They had this experience zozer The server
is like, sending the files to everybody.

37
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:38,449
It is going okay.

38
00:02:38,449 --> 00:02:45,919
You can see some of the iPhone things going
on.

39
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:50,270
One natural thing that can happen, the server
explodes.

40
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:56,389
It is not really viral anymore.

41
00:02:56,389 --> 00:02:57,630
How about we improve that?

42
00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:02,710
And a simple way would be to have every client
send data to eachother.

43
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:05,510
It looks like this.

44
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:08,310
We call them peers.

45
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:10,621
They are sending and receiving data.

46
00:03:10,621 --> 00:03:14,040
Swapping data around.

47
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,040
That's awesome.

48
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,630
This is what we call P2P.

49
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:22,970
I mean, there are problems.

50
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:27,040
Because, now we are sending data from arbitrary
people.

51
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,320
Getting data.

52
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:36,200
How do we know that no one will come in and
be like, this is the other talk that nobody

53
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,810
likes.

54
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:41,880
Coffeescript talks.

55
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:46,979
So, there is a simple solution.

56
00:03:46,979 --> 00:03:49,419
Take the file.

57
00:03:49,419 --> 00:03:51,590
We split it into equally sized pieces.

58
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:54,040
Half or 10 megs.

59
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:57,180
And hash them.

60
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:00,380
People know what it is.

61
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:01,620
Digest.

62
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:05,160
So, we can just get a piece from everybody.

63
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:07,260
Assuming we had these hashes.

64
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:13,360
If the hash doesn't match, it is a bad peer.

65
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,130
Throw it away.

66
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:21,280
We have to take this list of hashes, what
we call torrent file.

67
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:23,050
And we put it on the server.

68
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:28,120
It needs to distribute that.

69
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,480
That's pretty nice.

70
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:32,530
But it has to do with the problem.

71
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:36,759
You need people to talk to, to get the stuff.

72
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:37,900
How do we do that?

73
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:39,080
Well, dht.

74
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,850
Distributed hash table.

75
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:43,810
You know what it is?

76
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:44,990
All right!

77
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:52,780
So, it is basically a table that is dristributed.

78
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:55,250
So like a table, you put a key and value in.

79
00:04:55,250 --> 00:05:01,850
And you can get the things that are stored,
you get the values back.

80
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:04,200
We can just do something like this.

81
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,880
Take the torrent file and hash that.

82
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,700
A hash of hashers.

83
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:11,910
20 byte thing.

84
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:14,820
We store an address.

85
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:19,990
If we want to find out to share this file,
we do a list of keys.

86
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:24,130
On the torrent file and we get peers back.

87
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:25,130
Supersimple.

88
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:32,120
And the bittorrent Dht is huge.

89
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,160
Crazy.

90
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,040
There are around 10 million nodes.

91
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:43,360
The database at any time is a database where
you have 1 million nodes distributing data.

92
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:47,500
You need to take the 1 million people down
to bring it down.

93
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:54,000
The biggest database out there.

94
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,010
It is how it works.

95
00:05:56,010 --> 00:05:57,990
It is pretty simple.

96
00:05:57,990 --> 00:05:59,900
All right.

97
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:03,720
So, let's move on.

98
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:07,920
So, bittorrent is good for distributing a
bunch of data.

99
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:13,240
There is a huge amount of data on bittorrent.

100
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,050
That's cool.

101
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:18,610
But wouldn't it be cool if we could access
all this data instantly.

102
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:23,050
That we don't have to wait to download all
the data?

103
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:25,070
If we can make a bittorrent stream?

104
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:27,760
It would be cool.

105
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:31,550
So, how can we do that?

106
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:33,080
All right.

107
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:39,920
So, streaming bittorrent means that we have
these pieces, each equal pieces.

108
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:42,090
We fetch the piece we need.

109
00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:48,700
If someone wants piece 5, we get piece 5.

110
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:51,060
You have a peer with piece 5.

111
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:54,610
You ask that peer to give it.

112
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:56,780
Again this introduces a problem.

113
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:58,550
This guy can become evil.

114
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:01,950
And start being slow.

115
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:03,470
We are not getting our data.

116
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:07,400
If this peer is slow, we are not streaming.

117
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,110
That is a problem.

118
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:12,510
Luckily it is easy to improve this.

119
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:15,060
We fetch the piece from multiple peers.

120
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:19,910
We take the top 5 peers.

121
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:22,770
Rank them based on speed or something.

122
00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:26,880
And we fetch the same piece from multiple
people.

123
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:34,450
If one of the peers becomes slow, we can detect
it and swap him out.

124
00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:36,080
With someone else.

125
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:40,090
That's pretty cool.

126
00:07:40,090 --> 00:07:42,800
This gives the scenario where we waste bandwidth.

127
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,620
We are fetching the same data more than we
need.

128
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:47,930
It doesn't really matter.

129
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:50,200
It is for critical pieces.

130
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:55,460
Only for when we have a...

131
00:07:55,460 --> 00:08:01,560
It turns out it is a good algorithm.

132
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,770
As a module.

133
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:04,770
That's what we do these days.

134
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:07,290
It is called torrent-stream.

135
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:13,080
It is a node module that allows you to fetch
data.

136
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:16,480
And do this nice thing.

137
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:18,880
Where you just patch a torrentfile to a constructor.

138
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:26,490
You get the list of files in the torrent.

139
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:30,210
You can create streams right away.

140
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:32,070
You can do random access.

141
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:33,289
10 files.

142
00:08:33,289 --> 00:08:34,500
Whyf wait?

143
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:42,510
It is transmitting data when it is ready.

144
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:44,540
What can we use that for?

145
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:48,700
It turns out streaming is pretty big on internet.

146
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:52,210
It is a billion dollar industry.

147
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:54,370
There are huge players out there.

148
00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:56,300
People like Netflix.

149
00:08:56,300 --> 00:09:01,330
And as it turns out that during peak hours
when everybody is trying to watch House of

150
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:07,900
Cards it consumes 1/3 of internet traffic.

151
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:10,490
If you think about this number.

152
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:12,470
Fucking huge.

153
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:15,910
1/3 of the internet!

154
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:17,089
What?

155
00:09:17,089 --> 00:09:26,420
So, natural conclusion, wouldn't it be cool
if we take it if we use P2P.

156
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:29,529
Instead of Netflix?

157
00:09:29,529 --> 00:09:32,740
I implemented this, peerflix.

158
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:42,900
It is a program that streams video using P2P
and Bittorrent to Vlc.

159
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:46,029
I try to do a demo of that.

160
00:09:46,029 --> 00:09:50,130
It is a live demo.

161
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:53,270
So, things might blow up.

162
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:55,550
There we go.

163
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:57,070
All right.

164
00:09:57,070 --> 00:10:00,110
Just do like peerflix

165
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:04,850
You pass it a torrent.

166
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:13,810
What it will do now...

167
00:10:13,810 --> 00:10:19,010
Go out and start fetching data from peers.

168
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:24,440
What you will see, it is on my screen here.

169
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:28,790
This is actually streaming now live, no caching.

170
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:30,589
This is like a video.

171
00:10:30,589 --> 00:10:31,630
Documentary.

172
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:38,120
We can even do cool things like skip in the
movie.

173
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:44,130
Even though we are streaming.

174
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:46,310
Hopefully.

175
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:48,490
(applause)

176
00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:59,399
so, yeah, that's pretty awesome.

177
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:04,850
And this gives us, I was watching the worldcup
a couple of months back.

178
00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:09,010
Germany won I think.

179
00:11:09,010 --> 00:11:10,010
It was noticeable.

180
00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:12,000
Where you had a game a lot of people were
watching.

181
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:20,899
The quality, their online broadcasting dropped.

182
00:11:20,899 --> 00:11:23,920
We can flip this around and do something opposite.

183
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:28,050
The more are watching, the better it runs.

184
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:30,070
We can actually increase quality.

185
00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:31,990
Which is crazy.

186
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:36,240
The more people watch, the better it runs.

187
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:40,560
It is really cool.

188
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,750
And I mean, this is streaming video.

189
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:45,580
I have seen it before.

190
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:49,630
There were some guys built a UI on top of
my thing.

191
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:50,710
Popcorn time.

192
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:54,500
I don't know if you know it.

193
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:59,130
To work around this video.

194
00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:02,130
It can become a gimmick.

195
00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:04,760
I like to try to push things.

196
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:12,120
It takes us to the next segment, mad science.

197
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:17,990
So, when you are in the space li little while
you get the realisation.

198
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:22,930
We can stream anything out there that is on
bittorrent.

199
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:25,190
Which is kind of cool.

200
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:29,560
So, week ago I was preparing for this talk.

201
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:34,100
And I need some cool datastream.

202
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:39,620
So I went on Wikipedia to try to find some
good datasets.

203
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:41,830
Googled around.

204
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:44,790
It hit me.

205
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:47,140
Everything on Wikipedia is on bittorrent.

206
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:51,500
There is a torrentfile containing everything
on Wikipedia.

207
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:54,740
It's huge.

208
00:12:54,740 --> 00:13:00,750
So, I implemented Peerwiki.

209
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:09,660
It is a program that allows you to browse
Wikipedia using bittorrent realtime.

210
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:16,790
I am going to try to demo that.

211
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:18,120
It is bleeding edge.

212
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:27,490
I'm crossing my fingers here.

213
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:45,660
So, what it does now is, it is connecting
to Dht finding Wikipedia.

214
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:48,700
It creates a webserver.

215
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:52,780
That runs on this thing.

216
00:13:52,780 --> 00:14:00,160
So, what you are seeing here is the Wikipedia
article, using Bittorrent.

217
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,930
There is no centralized server.

218
00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:05,600
This is peer to peer.

219
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:10,790
If wou went to went to Wikipedia, please give
us money.

220
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:19,050
Because of the servers.

221
00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:21,390
We can even click the links here.

222
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:22,540
Hopefully.

223
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:26,650
So, there is latency involved.

224
00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:32,880
It needs to get out and fetch this link I
clicked on.

225
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,080
So...

226
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:37,280
(applause)

227
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:45,399
i mean like, this torrent is crazy.

228
00:14:45,399 --> 00:14:47,280
It contains everything on Wikipedia.

229
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,280
Even the assets.

230
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:49,280
This picture.

231
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:53,670
I don't know if you can see it.

232
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:56,350
That's a file in the bittorrent thing.

233
00:14:56,350 --> 00:14:57,760
That is fetching when I browse.

234
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:00,040
There are so many things happening here.

235
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:02,790
It is like, we are reading this article.

236
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:06,860
I know what is going on, it is like crazy.

237
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:08,050
Again we get the property.

238
00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:12,459
The more people browse this page, the better
Wikipedia runs.

239
00:15:12,459 --> 00:15:17,680
It is awesome.

240
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:28,050
So, let's try to stop that before we kill
the network.

241
00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:35,750
There is actually, the first use case for
bittorrent.

242
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:41,300
It turns out like, all of Linux is on Bittorrent.

243
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:45,430
And it is the case we hear.

244
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:49,610
You should download Ubuntu using Bittorrent.

245
00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:58,160
There is virtual box.

246
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:01,839
It allows you to spin up VM.

247
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:04,029
Using an Iso file.

248
00:16:04,029 --> 00:16:10,940
A Linux Iso file and virtual machine.

249
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:20,540
What if we could somehow take virtualbox and
max it use bittorrent instead.

250
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:25,850
What if we can make it on the streams.

251
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:28,790
Actually, it is lame.

252
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:34,360
Because virtual box already has a nice feature,
it deals with files.

253
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:39,480
What if we didn't do anything to virtualbox.

254
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:47,180
What if we somehow made this thing, that would
make bittorrent transparent on your machine.

255
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:51,720
And then make everything appear as regular
files.

256
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,860
A bittorrent file system.

257
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:57,100
It is colled torrent-mount.

258
00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:01,720
It allows you to take any bittorrent file.

259
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,080
The Wikipedia one.

260
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:05,449
Could be any of the files.

261
00:17:05,449 --> 00:17:07,610
And pass this to the prograr.

262
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:12,120
It will create a virtual file system, Fuse.

263
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:17,390
A thing that allows you to build filesystem
in userspace.

264
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:20,649
And you can browse this using a browser.

265
00:17:20,649 --> 00:17:23,040
Let's try to do that.

266
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:31,749
I need to open a finder.

267
00:17:31,749 --> 00:17:39,700
So, I just run Torrentmount.

268
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:45,590
And pass the ubuntu image.

269
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:47,940
Downloading from 40 peers.

270
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:51,230
I can go to my finder now.

271
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:59,330
I don't know if you can see it, it is there
in the finder.

272
00:17:59,330 --> 00:18:03,169
It is an abstract file.

273
00:18:03,169 --> 00:18:04,299
We are still downloading.

274
00:18:04,299 --> 00:18:09,309
We can boot up virtualbox.

275
00:18:09,309 --> 00:18:17,399
That was the wrong one.

276
00:18:17,399 --> 00:18:21,679
And I can go in and create a new virtual machine.

277
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:25,629
And I can find storage.

278
00:18:25,629 --> 00:18:26,649
I can click on browser.

279
00:18:26,649 --> 00:18:29,659
What I usually do.

280
00:18:29,659 --> 00:18:32,909
I can click, open finder.

281
00:18:32,909 --> 00:18:38,259
And select this iso file.

282
00:18:38,259 --> 00:18:39,549
Launch virtualbox.

283
00:18:39,549 --> 00:18:41,659
It is launching...

284
00:18:41,659 --> 00:18:54,119
So, what is happening here...

285
00:18:54,119 --> 00:18:56,619
(applause)

286
00:18:56,619 --> 00:18:58,179
i don't know if you can see it.

287
00:18:58,179 --> 00:19:03,370
We downloaded 80 MB so far.

288
00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:05,159
I should select German.

289
00:19:05,159 --> 00:19:08,590
Because we are in Germany.

290
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:12,850
It is like the Ubuntu install thing.

291
00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:15,220
I see we have a little bit more time.

292
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:18,990
We can even do more fun things.

293
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:25,629
I should probably shut it down.

294
00:19:25,629 --> 00:19:32,259
We can also take stuff like, we can take the
torrentfile.

295
00:19:32,259 --> 00:19:40,009
Mount that.

296
00:19:40,009 --> 00:19:42,000
And here is the video.

297
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,320
An mp4.

298
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:48,379
I should be able to...

299
00:19:48,379 --> 00:19:49,940
Open this with Vlc.

300
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:51,840
It is not even there yet.

301
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:52,840
And it is playign.

302
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:53,940
It is live streaming in.

303
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:54,940
From Bittorrent.

304
00:19:54,940 --> 00:20:06,600
And actually, this gives us this nice property.

305
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:10,909
If we skjip in the file and try to find some
dialogue.

306
00:20:10,909 --> 00:20:12,669
Hopefully.

307
00:20:12,669 --> 00:20:15,630
If we just...

308
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:20,919
Wait for someone to speak.

309
00:20:20,919 --> 00:20:23,929
You see there are subtitles there.

310
00:20:23,929 --> 00:20:30,539
It is because Vlc is seeing, there is another
file in the torrent, the subtitle file.

311
00:20:30,539 --> 00:20:33,139
That file is also on Bittorrent.

312
00:20:33,139 --> 00:20:39,990
What is happening, torrentmount says, you
want to read the subtitle file, let me try

313
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:42,330
to fetch it live.

314
00:20:42,330 --> 00:20:44,279
And stream it back to Vlc.

315
00:20:44,279 --> 00:20:50,029
Vlc doesn't care, it is reading it like a
regular file.

316
00:20:50,029 --> 00:20:51,820
You get this really transparent thing.

317
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:58,919
Where programs don't know what they are doing
but reading files.

318
00:20:58,919 --> 00:21:01,169
Awesome.

319
00:21:01,169 --> 00:21:03,409
Yeah.

320
00:21:03,409 --> 00:21:07,909
That's Torrentmount.

321
00:21:07,909 --> 00:21:09,990
That's it for me.

322
00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:17,889
I am already interested in talking Node, Bittorrent,
JS, anything.

323
00:21:17,889 --> 00:21:22,320
Find me at the hallway or at the party before
I get too drunk.

324
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:27,710
Or after, how mad the science should be.

325
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:33,159
You should check out these cool things.

326
00:21:33,159 --> 00:21:35,509
Webtorrent, went into alpha.

327
00:21:35,509 --> 00:21:37,309
Trying to do this thing.

328
00:21:37,309 --> 00:21:39,889
But only in the browser.

329
00:21:39,889 --> 00:21:40,889
Using no native things.

330
00:21:40,889 --> 00:21:45,020
That's going to be crazy.

331
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:53,200
There are substacks, That we hacked during
our conference a while back.

332
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:56,710
Let's take Google Maps and put it on Bittorrent.

333
00:21:56,710 --> 00:21:58,399
We don't need Google maps.

334
00:21:58,399 --> 00:22:00,809
That's it.
