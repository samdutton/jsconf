00:00:01,490 --> 00:00:06,930

reject for me personally reject is way

2
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:08,760
more than just the conference it's it's

3
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:11,010
a very special place with very special

4
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:12,690
people and they're all gathering here

5
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:15,719
and it's it's about much more than just

6
00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:17,670
technology it's really about the people

7
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:19,710
that are here and that's very very dear

8
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:23,430
to my heart so reject chess used to be a

9
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:25,619
tiny community conference and it has

10
00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:28,500
become a big conference over the years

11
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,179
now it's still run by people from the

12
00:00:30,179 --> 00:00:32,099
community for the community and it's a

13
00:00:32,099 --> 00:00:35,070
very special time this year because it's

14
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:37,140
the fifth anniversary and it's a big

15
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:42,260
celebration music they started as like

16
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:44,700
overflow conference to jay's calm you

17
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:47,129
give people a chance to reject it at

18
00:00:47,129 --> 00:00:49,500
jess come to you or either ticket prices

19
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:52,890
or by like not getting accepted so this

20
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:54,210
is very good idea to get more people

21
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:55,469
into the community and give them a

22
00:00:55,469 --> 00:01:16,429
chance to be part of a solo thing

23
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:19,869
actually this projector is the first

24
00:01:19,869 --> 00:01:22,539
protect yes and we're celebrating a

25
00:01:22,539 --> 00:01:26,560
birthday but unfortunately it's the last

26
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,840
one they're very sad about that but we

27
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:33,340
think it's time to move on and there are

28
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:35,890
also so many amazing things that went

29
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:38,259
out like started with the rejecters and

30
00:01:38,259 --> 00:01:41,319
