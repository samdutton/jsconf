00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:15,299

the script Mallinckrodt ingestible I

2
00:00:15,299 --> 00:00:18,660
work every right webrip i love what mr.

3
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:21,210
Brendan Eich malaga internets we write

4
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:24,240
about technology and bad dolores park

5
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,130
basically what am I talking about it

6
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:28,230
that's to ride out for keeping it real

7
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:31,410
big goes to joy you painting off big

8
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:33,840
just to my room then you get up I seen

9
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,309
infested route yeah that's my first

10
00:00:35,309 --> 00:00:43,530
slide stop you cannot because I heard

11
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:46,350
this one before / odds if you want a

12
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:48,840
copy to install packages use the module

13
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:52,140
system it was good so uh this is my

14
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,449
first slider here this is actually the

15
00:00:54,449 --> 00:00:57,690
default image for this scene right here

16
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:02,250
and I had to include it because it

17
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:08,700
looked cool and it's a ducati so yeah so

18
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:13,700
yeah I'm not the best programmer ever I

19
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:17,939
kind of just like a kind of make it up

20
00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:20,939
as you go kind of guy and so that's why

21
00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:23,659
I'm on the B track and not over there I

22
00:01:23,659 --> 00:01:26,189
just like that like put modules together

23
00:01:26,189 --> 00:01:30,299
and try to make them work so I love

24
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:35,090
github can see I've like 57 repos and

25
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:44,670
dub it's a lot of crap actually okay so

26
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:46,619
these are just pretty much all the

27
00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:48,840
modules that I use on a daily basis for

28
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:52,740
all my different projects and it's all

29
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:54,180
about standing on the shoulders of

30
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:55,890
giants I really like that phrase because

31
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:58,530
it's like all the good people are down

32
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:07,900
here

33
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:10,019
so I add these some of the modules i'm

34
00:02:10,019 --> 00:02:11,730
just going to like give you a look at

35
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:13,019
you probably already seen it before or

36
00:02:13,019 --> 00:02:15,690
maybe not they're really good to have in

37
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:18,150
your arsenal though so you got coffee

38
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:20,700
script by does anybody know how to

39
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:25,950
pronounce his name Josh kennice Josh

40
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:28,799
ganache alright second chain saw my sub

41
00:02:28,799 --> 00:02:32,610
stack Express TJ Holloway Chuck reddit's

42
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:37,709
by a Salvador then send Phillip bow now

43
00:02:37,709 --> 00:02:42,000
jazz request by Michael and discovery to

44
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,349
the shameless plug that I wrote like

45
00:02:43,349 --> 00:02:45,150
yesterday and I decide to throw in here

46
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:50,760
it's my first npm not module so alright

47
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:54,540
and that does not really fit on the

48
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:56,970
screen okay anyway this is CoffeeScript

49
00:02:56,970 --> 00:03:01,109
and no one here has already used

50
00:03:01,109 --> 00:03:04,140
coffeescript before ok so like half

51
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:07,079
about essentially what it does is it

52
00:03:07,079 --> 00:03:10,290
like JavaScript the good parts will only

53
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:13,109
let you use like the non crap parts of

54
00:03:13,109 --> 00:03:15,450
JavaScript like it will pass like jslint

55
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:18,420
like strict mode on everything so you're

56
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:20,099
like actually have good JavaScript

57
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:22,079
without really even trying and that's on

58
00:03:22,079 --> 00:03:24,419
the left side there that's like the copy

59
00:03:24,419 --> 00:03:26,790
script and then on the right side is

60
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:29,790
like the what it evaluates to and like

61
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:33,000
normal JavaScript and then you'll see

62
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:40,950
that like over here like Eddie yeah it

63
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:43,709
puts everything in its own scope so you

64
00:03:43,709 --> 00:03:45,239
don't have any global variables which is

65
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:51,030
pretty cool alright the next one is a

66
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:53,299
sec this is part of like flow control

67
00:03:53,299 --> 00:03:55,349
subsec wrote this and essentially what

68
00:03:55,349 --> 00:03:58,260
it does is you'll see that you require a

69
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:03,209
sec and then oh is this home awesome

70
00:04:03,209 --> 00:04:05,250
okay so you require sec right here right

71
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:09,419
and that means sequential power is

72
00:04:09,419 --> 00:04:11,970
parallel so it does the first one right

73
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:14,850
and then after it executes that it has a

74
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:16,320
little thing inside of it says okay I'm

75
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,810
done go down to the next one but if you

76
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:20,850
parallel one it go does both them at the

77
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:23,970
same time and it passes both of these

78
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:26,430
guys right here as these guys right here

79
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:30,660
and so it does a sec on do two of those

80
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:32,850
right there after both of them are done

81
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:34,950
at the same time so you don't have a

82
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:36,450
bunch of like callback and stuff like

83
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:39,450
that you can just do flow control code

84
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:41,070
oh and it over here you can't really see

85
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:44,130
it cuz it's up the screen it's a dot

86
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:47,060
catch which is awesome because like

87
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:50,340
normally you'd have to do like a catch

88
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:51,720
on each one of these but if you have a

89
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:55,320
catch up there that it'll catch any

90
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,639
errors you have in here so you only have

91
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:58,470
to have one catch statement to catch any

92
00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:00,600
air you have in that whole spiel over

93
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:06,780
there there's another example of the SEC

94
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:10,919
modulator just using different stuff and

95
00:05:10,919 --> 00:05:13,139
you can see at the bottom that's taking

96
00:05:13,139 --> 00:05:24,639
a B and C and doing them all at once

97
00:05:24,649 --> 00:05:28,409
alright this is express it's a pretty

98
00:05:28,409 --> 00:05:30,839
much the backbone of every like web type

99
00:05:30,839 --> 00:05:35,459
of thing that I do it just gives you

100
00:05:35,459 --> 00:05:37,619
like really simple dsl kind of like

101
00:05:37,619 --> 00:05:40,169
Sinatra if you guys are familiar with

102
00:05:40,169 --> 00:05:42,839
like Ruby Sinatra so you just have an

103
00:05:42,839 --> 00:05:44,129
appt up there they can't really see

104
00:05:44,129 --> 00:05:46,369
where you just require Express and then

105
00:05:46,369 --> 00:05:49,409
you just create app we didn't doing a

106
00:05:49,409 --> 00:05:51,659
new create server on your Express object

107
00:05:51,659 --> 00:05:53,849
and then you just listen on a port and

108
00:05:53,849 --> 00:05:55,289
then it's just really simple you know

109
00:05:55,289 --> 00:05:57,509
get post whatever your method is

110
00:05:57,509 --> 00:05:59,759
whatever the route is and then your

111
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:08,129
callback alright chainsaw this is really

112
00:06:08,129 --> 00:06:09,779
cool mod I actually built my module

113
00:06:09,779 --> 00:06:11,759
using chainsaw what it does it's for

114
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:14,009
creating modules so you can use flow

115
00:06:14,009 --> 00:06:15,569
control in your module when you create

116
00:06:15,569 --> 00:06:18,119
it so this is an example of a function

117
00:06:18,119 --> 00:06:21,359
called add do and it has two methods add

118
00:06:21,359 --> 00:06:25,229
and do and it over here is an example of

119
00:06:25,229 --> 00:06:28,709
like it works so you you do add do you

120
00:06:28,709 --> 00:06:30,449
instantiate it with a zero so it sets

121
00:06:30,449 --> 00:06:32,819
your thumb up there 20 and then you add

122
00:06:32,819 --> 00:06:37,559
five and then it does some plus equals n

123
00:06:37,559 --> 00:06:39,869
so adds five to it and then it goes to

124
00:06:39,869 --> 00:06:41,939
the next one so it's like okay I'm done

125
00:06:41,939 --> 00:06:43,860
this is now five and it's like add 10

126
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:47,639
alright so it's like 15 now and then

127
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:50,909
they do it actually gives a result of

128
00:06:50,909 --> 00:06:53,999
some back from your this new method

129
00:06:53,999 --> 00:06:57,659
right here where it says a saw nest so

130
00:06:57,659 --> 00:06:59,459
it returns that back into your thumb and

131
00:06:59,459 --> 00:07:01,319
it's like okay if sum is greater than 12

132
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:04,949
then add a negative 12 so subtract 12

133
00:07:04,949 --> 00:07:08,579
and then add two and then back down here

134
00:07:08,579 --> 00:07:11,399
do your some and it's like five or

135
00:07:11,399 --> 00:07:19,829
something like that redis this is one of

136
00:07:19,829 --> 00:07:20,969
my favorite libraries in the whole world

137
00:07:20,969 --> 00:07:22,759
well actually the whole system of Redis

138
00:07:22,759 --> 00:07:26,549
I'm coming from Ruby so I use this a lot

139
00:07:26,549 --> 00:07:31,169
in Ruby it's pretty much just a key

140
00:07:31,169 --> 00:07:33,449
value store so like if you want to set

141
00:07:33,449 --> 00:07:36,239
like a string you just do set the key

142
00:07:36,239 --> 00:07:37,080
the value

143
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,970
just persist it to the disk so you can

144
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:41,430
what I should persist to memory and then

145
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:43,050
like X amount of Rights later you can

146
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:45,599
sit in the configuration file you can be

147
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:47,129
like okay after like five thousand right

148
00:07:47,129 --> 00:07:48,810
or whatever then like persist it to a

149
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:52,080
file but uh you have different things

150
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:56,009
like hashes and sets and lists and it's

151
00:07:56,009 --> 00:08:00,930
really fun to like do just like in

152
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:02,340
memory storage stuff it's kind of like

153
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:04,650
memcache bit different actually my big

154
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:05,909
issues for this I don't even put up

155
00:08:05,909 --> 00:08:08,879
there is like pub/sub it's like for like

156
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:12,780
inter process communication like I'll

157
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:15,389
have one process go okay anytime one

158
00:08:15,389 --> 00:08:18,330
event happens I'm going to publish like

159
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:20,520
hey yo this happened and then the other

160
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:22,469
process will have a listener on it and

161
00:08:22,469 --> 00:08:26,099
it will accept a subscriber over here

162
00:08:26,099 --> 00:08:27,659
and say okay that happened and then do

163
00:08:27,659 --> 00:08:28,919
something else so i can have stuff on

164
00:08:28,919 --> 00:08:30,960
like two different things going on like

165
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,789
so I've architecture shredder classic

166
00:08:32,789 --> 00:08:34,769
like the whole system or whatever and

167
00:08:34,769 --> 00:08:36,329
then they're all talking to each other

168
00:08:36,329 --> 00:08:39,690
in real time and they can all just be

169
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:42,320
event driven using the pub sub

170
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:49,260
capabilities of brightest okay now Jas

171
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:51,829
is anybody ever using out Jason here

172
00:08:51,829 --> 00:08:53,910
alright it's kind of a new library

173
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:56,040
alright like three people so anybody

174
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:59,519
heard of stock and I oh okay so this is

175
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:01,760
like an abstraction on top of socket i/o

176
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:05,250
so ressaca diyos you know there's a

177
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:06,600
server in the client and it talked to

178
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:09,839
each other well this is for the server

179
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:11,220
the client also but it's a lot more

180
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:13,050
shorter as you can see right here like

181
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:15,240
on the server side you just do okay now

182
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:18,329
Jas eagles require now everyone it's

183
00:09:18,329 --> 00:09:20,730
just kind of like magical variable that

184
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:23,850
stores this namespace inside of it so

185
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:25,709
everybody is synchronized so if i do

186
00:09:25,709 --> 00:09:29,040
like everyone dot foo equals bar on the

187
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,199
server all the connected clients now

188
00:09:31,199 --> 00:09:32,850
have everyone up foo equals bar without

189
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:35,160
actually explicitly like telling the

190
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,920
clients to set that so everybody is in

191
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,769
sync so everybody has the same namespace

192
00:09:39,769 --> 00:09:45,750
variables so like this is the defining a

193
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:47,520
method right here so like everyone now

194
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:50,459
get server info in a function callback

195
00:09:50,459 --> 00:09:50,910
would

196
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:54,150
so what I can do on the client is I can

197
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:57,180
do all right now dot get server info and

198
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:58,620
I'll look on the client say okay do I

199
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:01,260
have this function defined on the client

200
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:03,450
and if not then automatically looks on

201
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:05,070
the server for that function in and

202
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:07,170
execute it so it kind of blurs the line

203
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:08,760
between having a function on the

204
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,620
client-side and server-side because

205
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:12,660
essentially to the client they're all

206
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:15,570
the same so you can do some really cool

207
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:17,340
like real-time stuff with like multiple

208
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:23,460
people doing that kind of thing so

209
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:26,460
here's an example of like server-side to

210
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:29,430
client-side suicide to client side so on

211
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:33,150
the server side you define distribute

212
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:35,310
message in then everyone now namespace

213
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:37,920
and then on the client side you're like

214
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,660
all right now not named prompt what's

215
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:42,120
your name and then they click the button

216
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:44,430
and then it does now that distribute

217
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:47,160
message and see since it's not set on

218
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,750
the client automatically jump it up to

219
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:51,720
the server and xq set function with this

220
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:55,650
argument and in it we turn down value

221
00:10:55,650 --> 00:11:01,500
and then everyone got nada shouldn't

222
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,540
matthew so that's on the server side and

223
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:07,140
then it calls the received message was

224
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:11,310
set up there and then receive message

225
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:14,880
down here so regardless of what side

226
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,230
it's set on you can call it from

227
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:20,310
wherever so it I use a lot for like

228
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:27,750
games and stuff like that request this

229
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:32,070
one's by Michael Rogers it's just a

230
00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:35,880
really cool utility for doing like HTTP

231
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:38,550
requests on stuff so you can use like

232
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:41,300
the standard like nodejs HTTP library

233
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:44,550
but uh I like this one because one of

234
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:46,080
the big things that does it follows

235
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,810
redirects so if you get like a 301 or

236
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:53,790
302 it'll automatically follow that and

237
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:55,410
here's some example code of how to use

238
00:11:55,410 --> 00:11:58,530
it so like requests and you can put the

239
00:11:58,530 --> 00:12:00,660
method in there in the URI and you can

240
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:02,610
send multi-part messages and then it's

241
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:04,350
just an array of what

242
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:08,250
what you want to send it and then

243
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:10,340
there's a response body so it gives you

244
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:13,260
three different variables in your

245
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:15,330
callback and you're going to evaluate

246
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:17,130
those and do different things depending

247
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:25,440
on what they evaluate to all right this

248
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,770
is a module that I made using chainsaw

249
00:12:28,770 --> 00:12:30,240
so you can kind of see the flow control

250
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,130
up here so what it does is you just

251
00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:37,560
require the module and then non-black

252
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:40,410
equals discover and then what is doing

253
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:44,160
is it's looking for the the RSS and atom

254
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:47,220
feeds in the main page all is looking

255
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:50,240
for like the link rel equals application

256
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:56,850
Adam XML application RSS xml but instead

257
00:12:56,850 --> 00:12:58,500
of doing like callbacks you can just do

258
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:01,500
the fine method and then when you run

259
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:02,730
that this is what you get so it looks

260
00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:04,620
goes to the first line look ma no

261
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:07,020
blocking and do another stuff now so

262
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:09,030
you're not blocking or halting up your

263
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:10,650
execution I mean one of those and then

264
00:13:10,650 --> 00:13:12,810
at the very end where it says dot do

265
00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:15,780
feeds four feet of feeds call it's a log

266
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:19,680
feeds is this what it outputs so just a

267
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,710
really terse way to kind of just like

268
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:27,720
process stuff and this is written in

269
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,130
CoffeeScript right here so it might look

270
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:30,300
a little bit different if you're not

271
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:38,770
used to seeing CoffeeScript syntax oh

272
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:43,460
yeah and this is this slide is for max

273
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:48,960
yeah all right I'm probably like not

274
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:52,950
even close to be in 30 minutes but 15

275
00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:55,530
minutes good anybody have any questions

276
00:13:55,530 --> 00:14:01,740
or anything

277
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:12,410
what do you mean by feet aggregation

278
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:16,420
we have some things like we'll have like

279
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:18,250
a big list of like a couple thousand

280
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:21,579
feeds where we go through and we splice

281
00:14:21,579 --> 00:14:23,589
all of them together to make one big

282
00:14:23,589 --> 00:14:26,319
feed it's kind of like all the current

283
00:14:26,319 --> 00:14:28,149
data from like all the different foods

284
00:14:28,149 --> 00:14:29,740
we have been different topics and then

285
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:33,590
we can look at what's going on with that

286
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:42,460
but that's like not so open source

287
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:55,540
first slide yeah

288
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:59,520
so I were because ed and I always felt

289
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:01,290
like all these scripts is going to be in

290
00:15:01,290 --> 00:15:06,050
my ass that's valid or not I think it I

291
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:08,340
think it depends on like your style

292
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:10,320
right like if you like the syntax and

293
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,870
like it feels good doing it like do it

294
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:15,570
and if not then not and because I mean

295
00:15:15,570 --> 00:15:17,670
it's like they're kind of saying for

296
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:19,080
CoffeeScript just coffee script which is

297
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:22,410
JavaScript so like it evaluates the

298
00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:23,850
JavaScript so it's not like a different

299
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:25,460
language or anything so I mean it's just

300
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:29,400
way of generating JavaScript so like if

301
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,260
people don't like it like I'm not trying

302
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:33,420
to like proselytize and like tell them

303
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:34,860
that they have to use coffeescript like

304
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:38,820
it just whatever feels right you make

305
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:41,250
some extra copy strip goth chick and

306
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:43,920
regular yes what not really everything

307
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,650
that I write is a mostly coffee scripts

308
00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:48,570
so all these examples I just copy and

309
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:50,160
paste it from the like the website for

310
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,560
the example code because I didn't really

311
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:53,970
want to make my own code since it is

312
00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:58,620
already there so uh so yeah like as you

313
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:01,680
can like on my module like that's why

314
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,570
it's coffee script because like that's

315
00:16:03,570 --> 00:16:04,950
pretty much all i right just cuz I like

316
00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:07,590
the the syntax of it I didn't notice I

317
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:20,530
was like that's all true yeah yeah

318
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:23,400
par seemed like how to find what the

319
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:30,450
feeds were whatever um I did it's a good

320
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:39,090
question i use the sum I forget what

321
00:16:39,090 --> 00:16:40,650
libraries I can pull that up real quick

322
00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:46,020
actually yeah it was a 10pm librarian

323
00:16:46,020 --> 00:17:20,540
producer share

324
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:23,130
it's a nut module called HTML parser is

325
00:17:23,130 --> 00:17:29,190
what I used and this is all coffee

326
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:30,630
scrutineers this is the library itself

327
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:34,380
is not that big so like right here I do

328
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:39,840
like where's HTML parser handler new

329
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:42,240
HTML polisher default handler right here

330
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:45,290
and let's do it creates a Dom element

331
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:49,740
and then I just can do a select on that

332
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:52,410
dumb for link elements and then I do a

333
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:55,140
for each link and it gives me element as

334
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:56,970
my return and then just a regular

335
00:17:56,970 --> 00:18:00,360
expression match for RSS or atom and I

336
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:03,240
yank out the the hof for that in and I

337
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:22,909
return it in a an array yeah

338
00:18:22,909 --> 00:18:28,279
yeah yeah i've used step in sec I like

339
00:18:28,279 --> 00:18:31,729
sec a lot I haven't really used it in

340
00:18:31,729 --> 00:18:33,080
anything in production I just played

341
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:38,269
around with it before oh because sec is

342
00:18:38,269 --> 00:18:40,909
for like actually riding your program

343
00:18:40,909 --> 00:18:42,769
whereas chainsaw is made for writing

344
00:18:42,769 --> 00:18:45,590
your modules so like it's one that's

345
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:54,210
like different sides of the same coin

346
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:57,859
this soup select like a bloody of HTML

347
00:18:57,859 --> 00:19:03,559
parser or oh yeah super select is a it's

348
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:06,080
a weight cuz like HTML parser gives you

349
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:09,159
a Dom element like right here and then

350
00:19:09,159 --> 00:19:11,929
select is worth soup so that comes in

351
00:19:11,929 --> 00:19:13,729
and it just allows you to easily select

352
00:19:13,729 --> 00:19:15,889
your Dom elements so it gives you really

353
00:19:15,889 --> 00:19:18,470
like terse way to just too I just do

354
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:20,389
select Dom blank for each and then that

355
00:19:20,389 --> 00:19:27,470
will go through every dump for every for

356
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:28,970
every link element just give me the

357
00:19:28,970 --> 00:19:31,159
properties for that without having to do

358
00:19:31,159 --> 00:19:35,989
a whole lot of code RV vision jizzed on

359
00:19:35,989 --> 00:19:55,119
g4 now right

360
00:19:55,129 --> 00:20:03,830
we mean like

361
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:10,660
yeah I'm going to say probably I mean I

362
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:12,520
haven't really used that library just

363
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:14,860
because I needed a quick Dom element and

364
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:16,750
I read on like some blog that that was a

365
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:19,030
quick way to do it so I'm really played

366
00:20:19,030 --> 00:20:20,560
with it enough to know like how fully

367
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:23,760
featured HTML parser DOM is but I mean

368
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:26,140
since it's a dominantly one of the

369
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:28,210
dependency of dependencies of it is

370
00:20:28,210 --> 00:20:30,010
probably J is dumb and that's probably

371
00:20:30,010 --> 00:20:32,170
just the Jays Dom element but I don't

372
00:20:32,170 --> 00:20:34,690
know for sure anybody else got any

373
00:20:34,690 --> 00:20:45,240
questions comments or concerns yes ooh

374
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:50,140

375
00:20:50,140 --> 00:21:02,890

376
00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:04,480
