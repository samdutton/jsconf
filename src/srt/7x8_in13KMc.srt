00:00:07,849 --> 00:00:11,610

hello so it's been quite a few days

2
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:13,530
already and it's the first time next

3
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:15,150
year I'm Jose conf which is amazing

4
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:16,529
because everybody thought I'm part of

5
00:00:16,529 --> 00:00:19,740
the crowd already so my talk today after

6
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:21,570
I'd found all your computers here around

7
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:24,420
me with the Bonjour thing originally I

8
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:25,560
wanted to call it how to teach

9
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,000
JavaScript without sounding like a dick

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,640
but I didn't think it was a good idea so

11
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:30,869
I just called a community chairs

12
00:00:30,869 --> 00:00:34,739
reloaded if you remember last year we

13
00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:37,500
had Chris here on stage who talked about

14
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:38,700
he loved the pirate and damn the

15
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:42,690
privateers so he started to remind us

16
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:45,000
that as a community we're not quite

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,219
there yet we're not quite public people

18
00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:49,140
don't see JavaScript developers as a

19
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:51,420
community much like we see you

20
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:54,149
excommunicate a community or the flash

21
00:00:54,149 --> 00:00:57,539
community and we did some good things

22
00:00:57,539 --> 00:00:59,699
about this and we changed it a bit and

23
00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:01,739
that was good so first thing we did is

24
00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:03,539
we did an operation cleanup where we

25
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:06,299
actually put badges on our own blocks

26
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:08,700
that linked to a documentation of

27
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:11,220
JavaScript on mdn to make sure that

28
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:12,840
certain websites that have bad

29
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:15,210
JavaScript information are not showing

30
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:16,770
up in google as the first results

31
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:19,110
anymore and well done we've worked

32
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:20,909
around that and we have a better thing

33
00:01:20,909 --> 00:01:24,060
we actually went further with that and

34
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:26,340
we call these websites out on the

35
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:27,689
problems that they have with their

36
00:01:27,689 --> 00:01:30,810
website so that was this w3c fools com

37
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:32,430
which actually showed all the errors

38
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:35,400
that are on w3 schools and allegedly

39
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,630
they are looking at that and actually

40
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:38,939
fixing the w3 schools as it is right now

41
00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:41,220
so this is even better rather than

42
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:43,140
replacing something we didn't believe in

43
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:45,210
we're trying to fix something that is

44
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:47,220
out there and people use and find is the

45
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:49,259
first information piece and it's pretty

46
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:52,170
good that we managed to get there so

47
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:54,240
thank you thank you for doing that great

48
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,130
job everybody we really really go out

49
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:58,259
there and javascript is becoming more

50
00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:00,750
understood by people as a technology

51
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:03,149
that runs the web and is therefore the

52
00:02:03,149 --> 00:02:04,740
web and not something that should be

53
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:06,930
compiled into something else or you have

54
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:07,640
to ride a real

55
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,380
language to turn into JavaScript which

56
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:11,240
is always a fascinating approach a few

57
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:15,620
years ago so well done us so we now can

58
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:17,600
say great we've done it we have can pat

59
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,160
on back and say we've done something

60
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:22,490
great this is a real patent you could

61
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:24,350
look that up on the website it's a pat

62
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:26,330
on the back machine this is what we got

63
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:28,880
Peyton's for that's why it's good to get

64
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,500
Peyton so you can sue each other over

65
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:34,640
stuff like that challenges however are

66
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,260
they are there still we have new

67
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:38,270
challenges to face right now because we

68
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:40,970
have the old one of asthma being seen as

69
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:44,239
a community but we still are in a world

70
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:47,000
right now where Travis crypt is being

71
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,500
seen as something that is running

72
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,840
everything but the web is not quite

73
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:53,480
there the web is now in danger of being

74
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:55,970
something that has to change people say

75
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:57,980
it's not fast enough we don't have

76
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:00,290
access to things on Hardware the web is

77
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:02,090
dying some people said already and

78
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:03,950
you're like okay fair enough i heard

79
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:05,930
that several times but looking at

80
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:07,310
technology and looking at some of the

81
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:09,019
languages that other people use i'm

82
00:03:09,019 --> 00:03:11,000
starting to think we have to ramp up a

83
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,700
bit and go out there and our challenges

84
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:15,620
the stuff that stops us from being

85
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:17,750
listened to and stops us from just

86
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:19,579
calling out that some of the things in

87
00:03:19,579 --> 00:03:22,060
the press are wrong are actually all

88
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:24,530
homemade more or less and these are the

89
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:26,239
challenges we've got a lot of fanboyism

90
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:28,280
going on the meshing with other

91
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,019
communities is not working the way it

92
00:03:30,019 --> 00:03:33,530
should be we quickly social skills is

93
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:35,120
something we normally have to work on

94
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,340
and sadly now if we don't because it's a

95
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:40,730
very well why should I change a passion

96
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:43,220
forget thing is going on and official

97
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:45,680
educational materials are painful then

98
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,450
there's a siren song of natives native

99
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:49,250
development like everybody like okay I

100
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:50,630
could do the web and learn about

101
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:52,400
everything around me or I can run an

102
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,019
iphone app and make millions of dollars

103
00:03:54,019 --> 00:03:55,670
when I listen to TechCrunch that's how

104
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:57,950
you do it but sadly enough its lucky

105
00:03:57,950 --> 00:04:00,110
enough it's not that way and tools are a

106
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:02,299
big problem to me as well so let's cover

107
00:04:02,299 --> 00:04:05,239
the basics before we start doing

108
00:04:05,239 --> 00:04:06,859
anything as a community what are the

109
00:04:06,859 --> 00:04:08,600
things that we as the JavaScript web

110
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:12,230
community actually want to come from and

111
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:13,579
what did how did we learn it when it

112
00:04:13,579 --> 00:04:15,170
became from

113
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:17,290
one of the things like view source wins

114
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:19,880
nobody here can tell me that they sat

115
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:22,130
down and they're in their kitchen with a

116
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:24,200
nice pipe and read a book about

117
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,030
JavaScript and started learning in from

118
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:27,800
scratch that way we looked at other

119
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,840
people's view source we copied and

120
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,760
pasted stuff hours until it broke and

121
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:34,010
then we read out why it broke then we

122
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:36,080
understood why there are the problems so

123
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,330
the view source is the main thing how

124
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:40,430
people get into what we're doing and the

125
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:41,810
view source doesn't only happen in the

126
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:44,210
browser it happens now on github it

127
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:46,160
happens on google code it happens on

128
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,200
whatever you wherever you put your code

129
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,930
in your in your in your blocks people

130
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:54,410
learn from what you do so it pains me

131
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:56,270
when I see new demos of cool new

132
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:58,370
technology to have really bad code and

133
00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:00,440
really badly written code because people

134
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,600
learn bad mistakes from copying and

135
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:05,810
pasting collaboration wings of course

136
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:07,880
it's like you put things on github and

137
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,440
the day later somebody put something

138
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,630
cool out there and added something new

139
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:13,970
did you didn't think about and all the

140
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:15,620
stuff that I do my slides are all

141
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:17,780
creative commons my books are all all

142
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:19,340
the articles that I write a creative

143
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:20,750
comments so you can translate them into

144
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:22,789
other languages and people do that for

145
00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:25,190
me so work together not be that one

146
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:27,650
guided does something and doesn't allow

147
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:30,140
people to add through the work they've

148
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:32,810
been writing and trial and error wins a

149
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:35,570
lot of times we throw things out and we

150
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:37,190
say it's awesome and then after three

151
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:38,780
comments on the blog we realize it's

152
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:41,060
actually not that awesome so stop

153
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:43,220
writing blog posts with one simple

154
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:44,930
example saying that's the best way of

155
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:46,340
doing it ever they're great

156
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:49,039
collaboration tools jsfiddle for example

157
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:51,289
is a wonderful thing that shows somebody

158
00:05:51,289 --> 00:05:52,820
when they have a problem on an IRC

159
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:55,940
channel oh I it doesn't work in HTML you

160
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:59,510
can show them HTML Javascript and CSS in

161
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:01,760
one screen and an executable version of

162
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:04,220
that problem that it has and anybody can

163
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:06,770
fork that then in jsfiddle itself and

164
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:09,200
update it and fix it with you the other

165
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,810
day I asked for rotating headlines like

166
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:14,810
90 degrees rotated headlines in CSS that

167
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:16,880
also work in aid in older browsers and I

168
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,840
just pulled up on jsfiddle put it up on

169
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,970
twitter and like 20 people sent me

170
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:22,710
different versions of it and 50 minutes

171
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:24,449
later we had one that's now going into

172
00:06:24,449 --> 00:06:27,150
the mdn documentation I could have done

173
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:29,010
that with on my blog and be awesome

174
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:30,780
would be the great blogger but in that

175
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:32,400
tool we just did it in 10 minutes

176
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,380
together in an afternoon on twitter and

177
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:37,530
you can all do that which brings me to

178
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:40,139
fanboyism and fanboys do something that

179
00:06:40,139 --> 00:06:42,600
is actually a real problem to me because

180
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:45,419
we all have our why don't I go full

181
00:06:45,419 --> 00:06:47,970
screen we all have our little things

182
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:49,680
that we like and everything else is not

183
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:54,570
as good and we shouldn't especially with

184
00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:59,430
browsers working for Firefox I have so

185
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:01,380
many people coming up to me and the

186
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:03,479
first sentence is like oh I'm sorry I

187
00:07:03,479 --> 00:07:05,729
use Chrome I'm like I'm not sorry for

188
00:07:05,729 --> 00:07:07,110
you if you're happy with chrome fair

189
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:08,970
enough there's nothing sorry about it

190
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:11,010
you don't have to use the browser that I

191
00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:12,930
work for you have to use a browser that

192
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:14,760
is modern and you have to update your

193
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,380
browser and when you find something

194
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:18,180
wrong with that browser you have to file

195
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:20,610
a bug about that problem then you then I

196
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:22,440
have no problem with it if you write

197
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,750
code that only works in one browser send

198
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:26,039
it out on the web and say like that's

199
00:07:26,039 --> 00:07:27,840
the future that I'm sorry this is the

200
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,360
past this is what we did in 1997 that's

201
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,070
why we have these websites that only run

202
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:35,039
on 1990s an Internet Explorer and we do

203
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:36,360
the same thing right now with a lot of

204
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,789
WebKit demos and demos with experimental

205
00:07:38,789 --> 00:07:40,979
stuff and said well of course it's

206
00:07:40,979 --> 00:07:42,750
broken in other browsers because it's

207
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:44,970
experimental in this browser yeah then

208
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:46,889
write your code that it detects the

209
00:07:46,889 --> 00:07:48,840
features and shows and if it doesn't

210
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,910
show it then show a video show the

211
00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:53,010
people what the other browser that you

212
00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:56,340
love actually can do with a video best

213
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:58,169
example canvas you do anything cool in

214
00:07:58,169 --> 00:08:00,060
canvas make a screenshot of what you're

215
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:01,770
doing canvas and put it inside the

216
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:04,289
canvas element as the fall back not only

217
00:08:04,289 --> 00:08:05,910
for people who don't have canvas but

218
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:08,550
also if somebody links that on facebook

219
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:11,130
that's the thumbnail so somebody sees

220
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:12,660
already what's happening in your canvas

221
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:16,080
thing before they go to it so love the

222
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,180
web this is the connectivity of the web

223
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:20,280
ended on this planet this is how many

224
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,110
people are connected and how fast they

225
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:24,419
are connected the how light it is is the

226
00:08:24,419 --> 00:08:27,060
speed of it isn't that awesome is it

227
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:29,310
amazing why should I write things that

228
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:30,340
only work in one car

229
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:32,260
tree and a lot of native code das said

230
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:33,909
right now sorry you can't watch that

231
00:08:33,909 --> 00:08:36,550
video because in America that is not the

232
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:38,680
web to me so we should fight these kind

233
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:40,330
of things we're a community that is

234
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:41,770
worldwide and talk to each other

235
00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:44,169
worldwide in several languages we should

236
00:08:44,169 --> 00:08:48,790
tell companies the same thing so www is

237
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:51,070
the World Wide Web never forget this

238
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:53,230
it's worldwide people with random

239
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:55,630
computers bad connectivity really old

240
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:57,400
browsers that cannot upgrade that don't

241
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,560
even know how to upgrade and they should

242
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:00,940
get something they should not get

243
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:02,260
everything you should not get the best

244
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:04,000
experience but it should get a

245
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,560
experienced you shouldn't block out

246
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:08,230
people so it's not we love WebKit and

247
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:10,990
it's not windows windows windows like

248
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:13,600
some companies tell us like oh look at

249
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,400
internet explorer 9 and 10 they're great

250
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,980
to use html5 or on windows XP sorry

251
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:19,630
about this you can buy a new operating

252
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:22,630
system then you get html5 as a community

253
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:24,370
we should say no this is not working I'm

254
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:28,570
sorry so you can't we have to fight ie6

255
00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:31,420
and XP users every single day and we

256
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:32,800
should get some support in that as well

257
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,620
and it's not welcome Western world so if

258
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:36,790
something doesn't work in other

259
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:38,980
languages it will have to work in other

260
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:40,900
language slew sooner or later and I

261
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:42,040
don't see many talks about

262
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,600
internationalization in JavaScript

263
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,890
because there's a lot of stuff happening

264
00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:48,790
there so stop following rock stars

265
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:50,740
that's another fanboyism that annoys me

266
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:53,410
like Oh Chris Hyneman said this Paul

267
00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:55,600
Irish said that that pie said dad that

268
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,089
guy said that we make gimmick rock stars

269
00:09:58,089 --> 00:09:59,589
out of developers and when you meet

270
00:09:59,589 --> 00:10:01,180
these guys they're all down on the

271
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:03,370
ground they're all nice people they make

272
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:06,160
mistakes they make public mistakes so

273
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,750
don't just take verbatim of what

274
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:09,310
everything about everybody says what I

275
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:11,770
say what anybody else says become one of

276
00:10:11,770 --> 00:10:14,410
those guys talk to us talk to other

277
00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:17,320
people communicate over mdn over other

278
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:19,450
communities to become part of the band

279
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:21,550
and not just the one rock star that will

280
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:23,170
basically be in rehab in two years

281
00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:27,100
because you just work too much meshing

282
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:29,680
with other communities there's a danger

283
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,540
to inbreeding

284
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:34,480
and this is an example this is a

285
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,430
JavaScript only community conference

286
00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:38,290
great we talk to each other and get very

287
00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:40,360
excited we release five different

288
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:42,670
libraries on every chase conf that never

289
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:44,769
get used in any product but it's awesome

290
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:46,930
this is innovation is great designers do

291
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:48,550
the same thing UX people do the same

292
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:50,920
thing symantec people do the same thing

293
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,870
we don't talk to each other if you look

294
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:54,430
at products that we build later on

295
00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:56,740
though it's a mixture of skills you work

296
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:58,269
with designers to work with your ex

297
00:10:58,269 --> 00:11:00,040
people you work with the semantic HTML

298
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,720
guys you work with the back end

299
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:04,000
developers and why why are we had

300
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,190
conferences on our own things and and

301
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:07,870
build things that only we are impressed

302
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:09,699
with rather than having talks with a

303
00:11:09,699 --> 00:11:11,800
designer and a developer together look

304
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,240
what we built together and this is how

305
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,709
we worked with each other that's

306
00:11:14,709 --> 00:11:16,600
something you can take back home so I

307
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,250
want all of you after this what you

308
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:20,500
learned here to infiltrate as much as

309
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:24,060
you can go to your ex meetups go to a

310
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:26,589
enterprise-level java architecture

311
00:11:26,589 --> 00:11:28,569
meetups and just tap talk to them about

312
00:11:28,569 --> 00:11:30,459
the cool stuff we've seen here because

313
00:11:30,459 --> 00:11:32,199
if we don't do that we're going to be

314
00:11:32,199 --> 00:11:33,850
this little geek group in the corner

315
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:35,769
that nobody cares about we now have to

316
00:11:35,769 --> 00:11:37,930
spread the word out out of our community

317
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:40,120
into the world and that's very important

318
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:42,730
and its technology is always a pick and

319
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:45,790
mix it's never one technology I saw this

320
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:47,680
in the park in Poland I really liked it

321
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:48,880
I'm just kind of keep winning like

322
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,720
physics stuff like ooh it's wonderful so

323
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:55,029
this is the result it's basically took

324
00:11:55,029 --> 00:11:57,790
canvas had some circles and rotated them

325
00:11:57,790 --> 00:12:00,010
so I realized I do everything in

326
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:01,600
JavaScript cuz I'm a JavaScript guy and

327
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,670
then somebody you can rotate that in CSS

328
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:05,260
as well and I'm not okay so rotate in

329
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:07,389
CSS wrote ten thousand lines of years as

330
00:12:07,389 --> 00:12:08,860
for every browser out that might or

331
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:11,170
might not support animation and I

332
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:13,000
thought why not actually mix the two so

333
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,439
if you look at the JavaScript of this

334
00:12:14,439 --> 00:12:17,529
one I actually do the painting in canvas

335
00:12:17,529 --> 00:12:21,100
but I do a rotation in in CSS when it's

336
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:23,260
available so i write out the CSS

337
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:24,730
animation only when it is available

338
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:26,920
because then i don't have to worry about

339
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,660
it the animation runs in the background

340
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:31,360
so i see a lot of talks about CSS

341
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,370
animation alone talks about javascript

342
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:36,279
animation not much mixing going on again

343
00:12:36,279 --> 00:12:38,199
and this is what we should be doing use

344
00:12:38,199 --> 00:12:40,220
browsers to their

345
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:42,680
they can do not what you like them to do

346
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:46,850
mostly so a little bit of respect for

347
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:49,070
other people is another very important

348
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:51,920
thing so whenever we release things as a

349
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:54,650
community and you have this great thing

350
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:57,890
with like a great imation in 3d and then

351
00:12:57,890 --> 00:12:59,540
you look at the thing and all the

352
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:01,340
buttons are actually just like diffs

353
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:03,370
with a click handler on them and

354
00:13:03,370 --> 00:13:05,330
somebody like me so I said okay how

355
00:13:05,330 --> 00:13:07,220
about a keyboard user how about somebody

356
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:09,410
who can't see a blind user why don't you

357
00:13:09,410 --> 00:13:10,610
use a button when there's a button

358
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:12,920
element and people say like well yeah it

359
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:15,080
doesn't matter that's only the HTML so

360
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:17,420
these people will not use our demos when

361
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:19,370
they don't apply to their rules so

362
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:21,080
partner with the designer partner with

363
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:23,420
with somebody who understands markup to

364
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:25,760
build really cool stuff together and you

365
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:28,130
see people like like Leia does that and

366
00:13:28,130 --> 00:13:29,930
she's you see how good her stuff is I

367
00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:31,540
can only do like nine cats in my slides

368
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:33,710
so there's part of a designer's and

369
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:36,530
others and stop selling our solution as

370
00:13:36,530 --> 00:13:38,840
the only legit ones every community does

371
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:42,050
that PHP versus python vs Ruby Wells's

372
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:44,630
Java versus pearl yeah so did I mean

373
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:45,800
when you're small in there in it when

374
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,450
you work in a small agency you have to

375
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:49,160
jump from technology to technology all

376
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:51,650
the time so be at least aware of the

377
00:13:51,650 --> 00:13:53,240
boundaries of what other people do

378
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,830
instead of saying like you should write

379
00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:56,000
this in pies and I'm not going to take

380
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,730
it if you use it in PHP only or you

381
00:13:58,730 --> 00:13:59,990
should do it in JavaScript I don't

382
00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:00,980
understand what you're doing with your

383
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:03,440
stuff there which brings me to social

384
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,320
skills there's a big problem in the geek

385
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,850
community which is called well actually

386
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:10,100
and there's a really good blog post

387
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,720
about this linked from these slides who

388
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:14,570
already online that explains to us that

389
00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:17,330
we always accumulate information we love

390
00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:19,040
information that nobody else cares about

391
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,650
and they tell something interesting or a

392
00:14:21,650 --> 00:14:23,300
tell a joke and we're like well actually

393
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:25,940
what you're saying is like we should be

394
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:28,310
doing this and that the interjection of

395
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:30,020
trying to force our knowledge on to

396
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:32,480
other people as eeks stops us from being

397
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,550
in meetings work where decisions are

398
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:36,350
being done that actually mean we have

399
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:38,600
eight more works 28 more works weeks to

400
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,340
do on something that could be one week

401
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:44,170
so think about before you intercept in

402
00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:46,640
communications and also on our mailing

403
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:48,920
spreads and stuff like that I parties

404
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:51,620
douchebag isms and a lot of them are

405
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:53,400
actually being called all the time

406
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,140
when you start a sentence with in the

407
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:57,990
real world you lost because you're real

408
00:14:57,990 --> 00:14:59,910
world is your own planet it's not like

409
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:02,490
anybody else's real world it's very

410
00:15:02,490 --> 00:15:04,140
dangerous to start with that sentence

411
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:06,330
because it's very arrogant show me the

412
00:15:06,330 --> 00:15:08,850
code don't talk about it another thing

413
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:11,010
like oh yeah well why would I commute to

414
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:12,660
communicate with you I just look at your

415
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:14,490
code thank you for before doing it by

416
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:16,410
the way but I don't understand care

417
00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:18,660
about you at all good code explains

418
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:20,820
itself best example ever when you talk

419
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:22,980
about documentation yeah well everybody

420
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:25,050
understands my coat well if it has to

421
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:26,460
same knowledge as you have the same

422
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:28,380
experience in the same style of coding

423
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:30,210
yes it's probably you then that

424
00:15:30,210 --> 00:15:32,100
understands your own code not the other

425
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:35,460
person that is very simple no need to

426
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:38,100
explain everybody knows this who's him

427
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:41,250
last talked earlier I went through her

428
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:42,960
slides with her and halfway through

429
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,790
she's like everybody knows this stuff

430
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:49,140
did you know everything in there no it's

431
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:51,600
the simplest things need explanations

432
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,520
over and over again because we forget

433
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,920
them we hunt after the new cool stuff we

434
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,950
don't explain the basics anymore go file

435
00:15:58,950 --> 00:16:00,780
a bug another good thing like why should

436
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:03,240
I talk to you designers my favorite like

437
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,740
designers come to me and say like

438
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:07,230
Firefox looks like numnah okay well

439
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:10,710
go to a go to box Scylla and file a bug

440
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:13,080
like sending a designer to box Allah is

441
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:16,280
like not gonna get into anything nice so

442
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:19,530
stop that as well it's all on the wiki

443
00:16:19,530 --> 00:16:21,720
like somewhere in the documentation we

444
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,880
have it just try to find it not a single

445
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,980
wiki engine I know has a search that

446
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:29,640
works they're all awful we fix that

447
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:31,770
later have you ever fix anything later

448
00:16:31,770 --> 00:16:33,780
after you shipped it no you went to the

449
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:37,110
next project nobody needs that and you

450
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:38,850
know everybody right it's like there's

451
00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:40,590
no use case when you haven't used it

452
00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:42,060
because everybody else should be you and

453
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:44,520
if not it doesn't count and that never

454
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:46,260
worked before is another big thing that

455
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:48,090
we do all the time if we did this we

456
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:49,680
wouldn't have no choice we wouldn't have

457
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,560
CSS animations we wouldn't have anything

458
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:55,080
so nobody uses XY set nobody use

459
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,610
Internet Explorer what are you talking

460
00:16:56,610 --> 00:16:57,990
about all my friends use chrome and

461
00:16:57,990 --> 00:16:59,810
firefox yeah good friends I

462
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:01,040
all my friends were chrome and firefox

463
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,170
users but sadly enough there's people

464
00:17:03,170 --> 00:17:04,520
out there still that haven't seen the

465
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:06,020
light or are not allowed to go to the

466
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:09,589
light that's what you get for using X Y

467
00:17:09,589 --> 00:17:11,270
said you should have you should buy a

468
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:13,640
mac well you're homeless but you should

469
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:15,140
buy a Mac then you can show and you see

470
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:18,890
what I've been doing and my favorite I

471
00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:20,209
will give you a script to you don't need

472
00:17:20,209 --> 00:17:22,130
to worry about it have you ever

473
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:24,020
considered that and we done that so many

474
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:25,550
times people come to the office and

475
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:27,350
annoy us with something and a simple

476
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:28,880
task that doesn't work that doesn't work

477
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,530
we'll raju a bit of code you have a

478
00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:32,120
button then depress it so you shut up

479
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:34,880
and you don't come back to me and that

480
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,620
way that person never learns and we're

481
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:38,120
the person that actually has to fix that

482
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:41,020
which is called patch and forget

483
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:44,090
libraries poly filter API so my we write

484
00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:46,160
all these cool things to fix things and

485
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,290
the poly fields that layers talked about

486
00:17:48,290 --> 00:17:49,490
are not the ones that I'm talking about

487
00:17:49,490 --> 00:17:51,590
I'm talking about the ones that give web

488
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:54,350
sockets to Internet Explorer 6 and talk

489
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:56,150
to the ones that give 3d animations to

490
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:58,910
intermix for a 5 and the ones that

491
00:17:58,910 --> 00:18:01,190
actually we touch input in somewhere and

492
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:02,960
say ok that's fixed now we don't worry

493
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,970
about it anymore we never test in these

494
00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:06,679
old browsers we never see if these

495
00:18:06,679 --> 00:18:09,080
things work and we just put the polyfill

496
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:11,360
or the API or the library somewhere and

497
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,250
then we never care about them and don't

498
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:14,840
fix them and don't upgrade them whereas

499
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:16,520
a new browser out because we're already

500
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:19,070
chasing the next library to build and we

501
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:20,360
do that all the time look at the

502
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:22,490
statistics of what shake very is in use

503
00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:25,490
in the reel web jquery 10 has lots and

504
00:18:25,490 --> 00:18:27,800
lots and lots of websites and nobody

505
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,570
upgrades even jquery although it's

506
00:18:29,570 --> 00:18:31,660
Institute was linked to the slash recent

507
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:34,190
so if you offer a quick solution for

508
00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:35,960
everything people love you they're like

509
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,190
out great i don't have to worry about it

510
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:39,260
but that geek friend of mine that gave

511
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:40,880
me that polyfill i put it in the page

512
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,150
and now everything rotates in 3d awesome

513
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:45,650
they also expected to maintain that for

514
00:18:45,650 --> 00:18:47,270
eternity because if something breaks

515
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:48,650
they don't know what's going on they

516
00:18:48,650 --> 00:18:50,270
just come back to you five years later

517
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:52,340
and sent you an email oh my company

518
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:55,160
website that sells are no sweaters for

519
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:57,200
budgies actually doesn't work right now

520
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,640
because of your script that you've

521
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:59,929
written eight years ago can you please

522
00:18:59,929 --> 00:19:01,940
fix that for me cause it's holding me

523
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:04,160
back and if your patch becomes an issue

524
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,780
than other people wrote a patch on top

525
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:07,880
of it so I've seen libraries that extend

526
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,350
other libraries to fix around issues

527
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:11,030
rather than fixing the original library

528
00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:11,870
go into the core

529
00:19:11,870 --> 00:19:14,750
that one and it's not really useful on

530
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:16,370
all because we patch and shift and

531
00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:18,260
release release release without looking

532
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:21,610
at it actually so educational material

533
00:19:21,610 --> 00:19:24,740
the joy of tech editing I'm just writing

534
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:26,870
a book right now I'm tech editing a book

535
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:29,059
right out as in use in every University

536
00:19:29,059 --> 00:19:31,160
in every high school in America they

537
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:33,020
make truckloads of money with that book

538
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:35,059
and it's basically by the thousands it

539
00:19:35,059 --> 00:19:36,920
gets ordered because in order for seven

540
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,630
years and it's been seen as good cause

541
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:42,380
material the event handler chapter had

542
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:45,980
as an example a table that got generated

543
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:49,130
with 10,000 table cells and a mouse a

544
00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:51,380
mouse move handler on each of them in

545
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:53,600
line that allows you to either color

546
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:56,390
them with blue or red depending on shift

547
00:19:56,390 --> 00:19:59,030
or ctrl key that you pressed the video

548
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:02,000
chapter or as HTML 5 1 now the video

549
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,980
chapter shows a video of a game of craps

550
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:06,080
what the rules are and rides a game of

551
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,370
craps that was written in that in

552
00:20:07,370 --> 00:20:10,220
javascript in 1997 this is the stuff

553
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:12,620
that people learn in universities this

554
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:14,059
is the stuff that they get graded on

555
00:20:14,059 --> 00:20:15,860
they don't want to learn it they just

556
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:17,600
have to get the grade so they have to

557
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:20,090
read that stuff so I hope that the book

558
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:21,530
is a bit better now but this is the

559
00:20:21,530 --> 00:20:23,809
things where we are so ask the people in

560
00:20:23,809 --> 00:20:27,770
a no that's called universities let's

561
00:20:27,770 --> 00:20:29,570
offer guest lectures let's go to

562
00:20:29,570 --> 00:20:31,760
university conferences and tell people

563
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,980
this is not what you teach the folk out

564
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:35,360
there this is what we should be teaching

565
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,429
them is what the market wants and this

566
00:20:37,429 --> 00:20:39,320
is what we have to learn every engineer

567
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:41,000
that I hire I have to re-educate for the

568
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,220
first half year how is that useful how

569
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:45,440
is that sensible it does it shouldn't

570
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,929
have to be that way and let's bring the

571
00:20:47,929 --> 00:20:49,760
enterprise and universities up to speed

572
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,710
I just spoke at a Java conference Java

573
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:53,210
Enterprise conference everybody in a

574
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:55,100
suit don't know what I did there but I

575
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:56,809
talked about new technologies people

576
00:20:56,809 --> 00:20:58,940
came up to me I now have video

577
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:01,580
conferences with s AP and a few other

578
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:02,990
big companies about these new

579
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:05,030
technologies and they have to learn

580
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:06,920
about a date they have to hear what we

581
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,780
have to say we can talk to each other

582
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:09,830
but we're not going to have an impact

583
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:11,450
because we have to use their room

584
00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:13,220
booking systems and their ticketing

585
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:14,870
systems and all that crap that they put

586
00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:18,980
on the web desk gold there you can make

587
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:20,480
money with this look at think vitamin

588
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,799
code school and code cat

589
00:21:21,799 --> 00:21:23,509
me which is a very hard to pronounce

590
00:21:23,509 --> 00:21:25,669
name it's a very cool website so these

591
00:21:25,669 --> 00:21:27,830
are all video tutorial websites that do

592
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:29,600
five minute of video tutorials on things

593
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,789
that we considered extremely easy and

594
00:21:31,789 --> 00:21:33,860
everybody knows and they are really

595
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:35,239
really successful with that they're

596
00:21:35,239 --> 00:21:36,919
making money with that some of them are

597
00:21:36,919 --> 00:21:39,080
incredibly bad as well and they could

598
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:42,200
feed back then from me mostly but think

599
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,029
rittiman for example had a PHP primer

600
00:21:44,029 --> 00:21:45,860
that told you in like five lines how to

601
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:47,419
get your server hacked because it was

602
00:21:47,419 --> 00:21:49,700
like passwords not even in a text file

603
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:52,539
not encrypted no filtering was wonderful

604
00:21:52,539 --> 00:21:55,820
now native things show you it's wrote a

605
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:57,799
blog post that web technologies need an

606
00:21:57,799 --> 00:22:00,139
owner that only technology is good when

607
00:22:00,139 --> 00:22:01,460
it has one owner Apple is only

608
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:02,960
successful because they control the

609
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,789
hardware and software and control

610
00:22:04,789 --> 00:22:06,169
everything that's why they're awesome is

611
00:22:06,169 --> 00:22:08,899
the web doomed is it doomed let's

612
00:22:08,899 --> 00:22:10,970
discuss that with him I don't think so

613
00:22:10,970 --> 00:22:15,019
so taking action on these points web

614
00:22:15,019 --> 00:22:17,809
intents you saw yesterday something we

615
00:22:17,809 --> 00:22:20,239
really need I really really want to have

616
00:22:20,239 --> 00:22:22,429
web applications then can just say I

617
00:22:22,429 --> 00:22:24,619
want to have a photo I don't care what

618
00:22:24,619 --> 00:22:26,899
photo sharing service you use you can

619
00:22:26,899 --> 00:22:29,149
use the stuff that you have in my web

620
00:22:29,149 --> 00:22:30,980
application rather than going to Flickr

621
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:33,169
where you have no photos or going to

622
00:22:33,169 --> 00:22:35,330
picasa where you have no photos puto

623
00:22:35,330 --> 00:22:38,179
gecko is mozillas thing right now well

624
00:22:38,179 --> 00:22:39,529
we want to build an operating system

625
00:22:39,529 --> 00:22:41,509
that runs on mobile devices that is

626
00:22:41,509 --> 00:22:43,190
completely open because we all have

627
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:44,869
mobile devices none of them are open

628
00:22:44,869 --> 00:22:47,809
android is open ish but the hardware is

629
00:22:47,809 --> 00:22:49,129
still not ours we don't know what's

630
00:22:49,129 --> 00:22:50,359
going on in there we don't have access

631
00:22:50,359 --> 00:22:52,460
to it so we're trying to work work

632
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:54,710
around that open web apps and I'm

633
00:22:54,710 --> 00:22:56,090
talking at future web apps tomorrow

634
00:22:56,090 --> 00:22:59,899
actually about this is web apps that can

635
00:22:59,899 --> 00:23:01,369
actually use the web and can be

636
00:23:01,369 --> 00:23:03,529
installed from any website and then

637
00:23:03,529 --> 00:23:05,269
dragged onto your desktop and send to

638
00:23:05,269 --> 00:23:07,009
your mobile phone that's something else

639
00:23:07,009 --> 00:23:09,830
we're working on web api switches api's

640
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:11,480
that are in boot to gecko de allows you

641
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:12,590
to access the camera or the

642
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:14,899
accelerometer all these code stuff that

643
00:23:14,899 --> 00:23:16,580
the native kids use and we're not

644
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:19,309
allowed to use somehow and browser ID is

645
00:23:19,309 --> 00:23:21,799
a way to actually log in into a web

646
00:23:21,799 --> 00:23:23,509
sites and into web applications without

647
00:23:23,509 --> 00:23:25,730
having to use a password because the

648
00:23:25,730 --> 00:23:27,980
password is stored much like open ID in

649
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:29,960
a secret with you and you can take your

650
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:32,119
identity with you throughout the web we

651
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:33,560
have full screen API we have

652
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:35,780
notifications API we've got context

653
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:37,310
menus in the browser that's what I'm

654
00:23:37,310 --> 00:23:39,470
working on right now in a few demos to

655
00:23:39,470 --> 00:23:41,390
right-click and have a context menu to

656
00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:43,640
do things that real applications do we

657
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:45,200
don't have sudden browsers yet but it's

658
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,720
coming which brings me to tools we have

659
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:50,570
a few talks about that already and I

660
00:23:50,570 --> 00:23:53,450
think the thing about tools is that a

661
00:23:53,450 --> 00:23:54,920
lot of the things that came in the last

662
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:57,620
few years taught people how to build for

663
00:23:57,620 --> 00:23:59,000
websites because the tools in the

664
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,460
browser's were better let's talk about

665
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:05,360
this one quickly adobe muse anybody seen

666
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,810
that adobe released a

667
00:24:07,810 --> 00:24:09,590
what-you-see-is-what-you-get editor that

668
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:12,410
is new and cool and creates html5 ish

669
00:24:12,410 --> 00:24:15,650
things and everybody was in a tizzy and

670
00:24:15,650 --> 00:24:17,270
and basically had a good laugh about it

671
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:18,620
and said like oh my God look at that

672
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:21,440
code that's awful and why do you do and

673
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:24,080
the question is why do they do why does

674
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:26,150
a company like Adobe who is not stupid

675
00:24:26,150 --> 00:24:28,790
who made software tools for years and

676
00:24:28,790 --> 00:24:30,860
years and years really good ones why do

677
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:33,380
they think 2011 is a good year to

678
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:35,150
release and what you see is what you get

679
00:24:35,150 --> 00:24:37,250
editor when we've been telling the world

680
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:39,380
for years that web technologies are easy

681
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:41,690
and HTML is easy and see us as it's easy

682
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:43,670
and javascript is easy you don't need a

683
00:24:43,670 --> 00:24:45,860
tool to paint and what you see is what

684
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:47,540
you get editor on the web is the most

685
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:48,980
stupid thing you can ever think of

686
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:50,690
because the power of the web is that

687
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:52,520
your web application your websites your

688
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:55,010
web your app can actually change

689
00:24:55,010 --> 00:24:57,560
according to what the end user uses we

690
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:59,390
can give people the best experience in

691
00:24:59,390 --> 00:25:01,040
all in their environments rather than

692
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:02,900
one experience for all so the whole

693
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:04,430
concept of what you see is what you get

694
00:25:04,430 --> 00:25:06,590
is broken but adobe still had the idea

695
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:08,300
there's a market out there people need

696
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:10,580
this so we failed at reaching a lot of

697
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:12,560
people with these things that are so

698
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:15,890
simple and everybody knows debugging

699
00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:18,200
tools are a big thing Firebug I think

700
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:20,090
was the main thing that made us as a

701
00:25:20,090 --> 00:25:22,640
community starts to build things much

702
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,560
much better before they're with alerts

703
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:26,360
in the page and like we did not know

704
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:28,460
what's going on why does that thing not

705
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:30,950
green why is it blue what is that layout

706
00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:32,960
doing you're right click did you looked

707
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,430
at it and it worked out Firebug is

708
00:25:34,430 --> 00:25:37,040
getting old it's also slow it's actually

709
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:39,320
a it's maintained still we have a full

710
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:41,030
person on it a full-time person on it

711
00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:42,770
but it's it's one of the main things

712
00:25:42,770 --> 00:25:43,910
that people complain about

713
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:47,270
so to me developer tools that we have

714
00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:49,430
right now are much more than debugging

715
00:25:49,430 --> 00:25:50,990
so it's great that we have wonderful

716
00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:52,670
IDEs but wouldn't it be awesome if we

717
00:25:52,670 --> 00:25:54,770
just in the browser can start editing

718
00:25:54,770 --> 00:25:56,540
and understanding things and

719
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:58,370
understanding what's going on there and

720
00:25:58,370 --> 00:25:59,690
start fiddling with the page and having

721
00:25:59,690 --> 00:26:01,910
fun with it so here's a preview of the

722
00:26:01,910 --> 00:26:03,230
stuff that's coming in the next

723
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:06,320
Firefox's there's actually a demo game

724
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,300
GT you can download so this is now the

725
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:11,660
the picker the the element picker that

726
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:13,010
we had before so instead of

727
00:26:13,010 --> 00:26:14,870
right-clicking in the HTML having the

728
00:26:14,870 --> 00:26:16,760
blue and green bars that fall over all

729
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:18,020
the time when you move your mouse you

730
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:19,790
don't pick it anymore you have a real

731
00:26:19,790 --> 00:26:21,920
animation thing going on here you've got

732
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:25,490
you've got some breadcrumbs to navigate

733
00:26:25,490 --> 00:26:26,900
through the Dom to make people

734
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:28,550
understand it block the Dom in the page

735
00:26:28,550 --> 00:26:29,930
is more less like a file system on your

736
00:26:29,930 --> 00:26:32,600
computer as well we have a style

737
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,100
inspector which I'm not going to go into

738
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:35,630
much it's basically give you the same

739
00:26:35,630 --> 00:26:37,610
things here and you can do the styles

740
00:26:37,610 --> 00:26:40,370
what's really cool is that with with the

741
00:26:40,370 --> 00:26:42,860
style editor you can start styling a

742
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:45,350
document life in the browser and saving

743
00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:48,020
it back to your hard drive I always use

744
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:50,030
the web toolbar for that I always wrote

745
00:26:50,030 --> 00:26:51,470
my sister styles and they are copied and

746
00:26:51,470 --> 00:26:53,120
pasted in safe to them to my hard drive

747
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,670
put it up on ftp so that's now coming in

748
00:26:55,670 --> 00:26:57,110
the browser and you can actually edit

749
00:26:57,110 --> 00:26:58,910
that you see it transitions from one to

750
00:26:58,910 --> 00:27:00,950
another so showing people some cool gear

751
00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:03,590
CSS stuff just use that don't write any

752
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:05,630
slides to do it or that you have to do

753
00:27:05,630 --> 00:27:08,510
there okay we went overboard with a 3d

754
00:27:08,510 --> 00:27:10,340
display of your document that actually

755
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:12,740
is using the accelerometer of your

756
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:15,110
computer as well so you can actually it

757
00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:16,940
shows the dome as a three-deep you and

758
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:18,260
you can actually fly through your

759
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:25,710
website right now but in a music

760
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:28,130
it actually Souls you when your

761
00:27:28,130 --> 00:27:30,170
navigation is 40 levels deep that is a

762
00:27:30,170 --> 00:27:32,150
 idea so that is pretty good about

763
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:33,980
idea so that is pretty good about
this so this would use his WebGL as well

764
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:37,730
and the web console is the same as we

765
00:27:37,730 --> 00:27:39,230
have a fire before so you can

766
00:27:39,230 --> 00:27:40,640
actually do all the alert stuff the

767
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,770
warning stuff and all the things that

768
00:27:42,770 --> 00:27:44,750
you expected but actually getting much

769
00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:46,730
better now because you can filter things

770
00:27:46,730 --> 00:27:48,470
down that is already in the life Firefox

771
00:27:48,470 --> 00:27:52,670
right now in browser scratchpad fair

772
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:54,170
enough you can write JavaScript you can

773
00:27:54,170 --> 00:27:55,880
put it in the page why can't you trust a

774
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:58,160
bit of JavaScript in the console you can

775
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,510
do that but it comes really unreadable

776
00:27:59,510 --> 00:28:01,760
so we put a scratch pad in that it

777
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,559
allows you to actually build things in

778
00:28:03,559 --> 00:28:05,929
the browser itself and what you can do

779
00:28:05,929 --> 00:28:07,520
with it and there's colors here as well

780
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:10,760
you can also highlight lines and I say

781
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:12,920
only execute those lines in the document

782
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:15,470
right now so you can debug bit by bit

783
00:28:15,470 --> 00:28:17,179
without having to comment it out like we

784
00:28:17,179 --> 00:28:19,100
did in the past or go through a hard to

785
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:21,290
understand debugger with like with like

786
00:28:21,290 --> 00:28:23,240
stock points and these kind of things so

787
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:24,800
you can highlight parts of it and run

788
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:27,620
them in there as well source mapping now

789
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:29,690
this is really cool this is not coming

790
00:28:29,690 --> 00:28:34,370
that soon fun let's write some coffee

791
00:28:34,370 --> 00:28:36,110
script and have some JavaScript

792
00:28:36,110 --> 00:28:38,030
generated from it and we have an error

793
00:28:38,030 --> 00:28:41,450
in both of them and once we have the

794
00:28:41,450 --> 00:28:43,100
error and it actually runs and we see

795
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:45,860
there was an error going on in the tools

796
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:47,750
it tells me that there's something went

797
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:49,250
wrong I haven't seen the video much yet

798
00:28:49,250 --> 00:28:50,990
so i'm waiting a bit here so I tias

799
00:28:50,990 --> 00:28:52,940
knowledge the era India and if I click

800
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:54,740
on the error message right now on this

801
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:56,179
thing it shows me two lines it shows

802
00:28:56,179 --> 00:28:57,620
with JavaScript and shows me a coffee

803
00:28:57,620 --> 00:28:59,600
script so I can click on that and

804
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,550
directly edit the coffee script without

805
00:29:01,550 --> 00:29:03,500
having to realize that the javascript

806
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:05,170
error is somewhere in the generated code

807
00:29:05,170 --> 00:29:10,610
and this is exactly what I want

808
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:13,570
and of course as is a geek tool all of

809
00:29:13,570 --> 00:29:14,920
these things have a command line in

810
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:17,290
itself so you can turn on and turn off

811
00:29:17,290 --> 00:29:19,240
all the things with different commands

812
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:20,560
if you don't want to use your mouse at

813
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:22,900
all so you can highlight nodes by giving

814
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:25,270
it a have using a highlight f function

815
00:29:25,270 --> 00:29:28,930
and all these kind of things so I always

816
00:29:28,930 --> 00:29:30,790
remember one thing that mediocre teacher

817
00:29:30,790 --> 00:29:33,250
tells i can tell you cool a good

818
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:35,950
teacher explains why it is a superior

819
00:29:35,950 --> 00:29:37,810
teacher demonstrate all of what i can do

820
00:29:37,810 --> 00:29:39,490
a can live code for an hour you can't

821
00:29:39,490 --> 00:29:40,870
follow it you won't have anything from

822
00:29:40,870 --> 00:29:43,570
it but I'm and I awesome the great

823
00:29:43,570 --> 00:29:46,090
teacher inspires so with tools in the

824
00:29:46,090 --> 00:29:48,040
browser showing people what's going on

825
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:50,560
with us talking to developers and

826
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:52,690
designers and people we don't want to

827
00:29:52,690 --> 00:29:54,490
talk about we have a chance that we

828
00:29:54,490 --> 00:29:55,780
could listen to it but not this geek

829
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:57,370
community that does their own events and

830
00:29:57,370 --> 00:29:59,550
actually only talks to it to themselves

831
00:29:59,550 --> 00:30:01,570
that's all I have the slides are online
