1
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:15,450

hey everybody um I was

2
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:18,780
who it with an old joke so our

3
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:20,880
programmer is about to leave to the

4
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,360
grocery stores and and her husband asks

5
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:27,210
her honey can you please buy some bread

6
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:30,869
and if there are any eggs

7
00:00:30,869 --> 00:00:35,640
could you please buy a dozen and ash and

8
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:38,520
she goes to the store she comes back and

9
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:41,370
you can imagine he his or his surprise

10
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:45,030
when she brings back a dozen loaves of

11
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:50,610
bread so we obviously have a have a

12
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:54,059
problem here right so what if the

13
00:00:54,059 --> 00:00:58,949
problem is in the earth right if he if

14
00:00:58,949 --> 00:01:01,920
he didn't give her any choice there

15
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,339
wouldn't have been any any trouble right

16
00:01:04,339 --> 00:01:09,330
so unfortunately computers are really

17
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:12,810
bad at at working without if a closest

18
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:15,690
or without branching in general without

19
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:17,909
switch without ternary operators and

20
00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:21,359
stuff like this because they will be

21
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:29,280
able to do only one thing this is not

22
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,270
really good right and culturally people

23
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:37,590
we also really like choice because we

24
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:39,329
currently further otherwise without

25
00:01:39,329 --> 00:01:43,320
choice right we we are we really needed

26
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:46,829
so we will have to look at the problem

27
00:01:46,829 --> 00:01:50,429
somewhere else and where else would will

28
00:01:50,429 --> 00:01:55,710
be would be the problem people talk

29
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:59,189
about if a lot but people rarely talk

30
00:01:59,189 --> 00:02:02,999
about else and you can see that in in

31
00:02:02,999 --> 00:02:09,060
English books the word if he is actually

32
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:12,210
seen more than 10 times more than than

33
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:16,560
the word else which is a lot so people

34
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:22,050
like if a lot more than else and however

35
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:27,390
in in computer programs the world the

36
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:29,290
word if is actually seen on

37
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:33,459
or only four times more than else which

38
00:02:33,459 --> 00:02:35,379
is which means the team computer

39
00:02:35,379 --> 00:02:37,780
programs we have two point five times

40
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:42,040
more else clauses then if clauses why is

41
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:44,049
there such a such a big difference

42
00:02:44,049 --> 00:02:46,379
between natural language and code

43
00:02:46,379 --> 00:02:50,170
because we're kind of supposed to eat to

44
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:52,239
express with code war what we want to

45
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:57,220
say with natural language right and I'll

46
00:02:57,220 --> 00:03:01,930
try to to give you a few reasons but but

47
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:05,040
first let us try to track a typical

48
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,810
logic statement with ifs and else's

49
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:14,530
right we we have on if with condition

50
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:16,900
one and this piece of code will will be

51
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:19,480
executed if condition number one is true

52
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:23,829
right then this piece of code will will

53
00:03:23,829 --> 00:03:26,620
be executed if if both conditions one

54
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:29,980
and two are true right then we go to

55
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:33,819
announce where we have to change our

56
00:03:33,819 --> 00:03:37,739
context in in in in the sense that

57
00:03:37,739 --> 00:03:40,510
condition number two now now he has to

58
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:43,840
be false when when we are trying to read

59
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:48,459
the code and and this help and the same

60
00:03:48,459 --> 00:03:50,620
thing happens for the rest of the

61
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:55,720
Earth's closest we have to always do a

62
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:58,510
context which every time we are we are

63
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:03,340
reading an else and historically context

64
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:05,319
switches has been really hard both for

65
00:04:05,319 --> 00:04:10,359
computers and for people doing doing of

66
00:04:10,359 --> 00:04:14,949
our everyday jobs so before we continue

67
00:04:14,949 --> 00:04:17,829
on letter let us look at war what would

68
00:04:17,829 --> 00:04:19,720
a statement containing only only if

69
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:23,590
clauses would look like without any

70
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:27,360
analysis we will have to remember that

71
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,009
this code will basic execute it only

72
00:04:30,009 --> 00:04:31,720
when only when the first connect

73
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,699
condition is true this code will be

74
00:04:33,699 --> 00:04:35,470
executed when both the first and the

75
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:38,380
second conditions are true the next

76
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:40,539
piece of code will be well when all of

77
00:04:40,539 --> 00:04:42,580
the first three conditions are true

78
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:45,039
and finally the last piece of code will

79
00:04:45,039 --> 00:04:48,159
be executed only the only the only way

80
00:04:48,159 --> 00:04:51,129
when all four conditions are true so we

81
00:04:51,129 --> 00:04:52,750
don't do any context which is we just

82
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:55,500
we're just adding more more context and

83
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:59,259
in general for four people and

84
00:04:59,259 --> 00:05:03,969
historically change is bad people never

85
00:05:03,969 --> 00:05:07,599
never like change but people actually

86
00:05:07,599 --> 00:05:09,909
like building stuff and they like adding

87
00:05:09,909 --> 00:05:12,909
more and more stuff nobody likes my

88
00:05:12,909 --> 00:05:15,879
grating laptops but everybody likes new

89
00:05:15,879 --> 00:05:22,810
new laptops right and so now I will out

90
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:25,330
take another try at explaining why there

91
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:28,870
are so many more else Clause is in

92
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:30,879
programming compared to in in natural

93
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:34,300
language and I think the reason is that

94
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:38,319
else clauses help us help us explain a

95
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:43,509
much more complicated logic and and we

96
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:47,139
use a more complex logic a lot more when

97
00:05:47,139 --> 00:05:50,319
when we talk to computers then when when

98
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:53,349
we talk to people because computers are

99
00:05:53,349 --> 00:05:55,750
a lot better at at understanding logic

100
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:59,110
right and unfortunately people are not

101
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:04,610
at all great at at understanding logic

102
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:08,589
we were just too lazy we are too bored

103
00:06:08,589 --> 00:06:09,759
too too easily

104
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:12,879
and people also fall really easy for our

105
00:06:12,879 --> 00:06:16,990
logical fallacies but I don't know how

106
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:20,770
many times have you tried to trace an

107
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:23,440
algorithm you wrote and it is always

108
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,779
incredibly annoying to to keep all of

109
00:06:25,779 --> 00:06:30,250
the state of in our minds and and is

110
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:33,190
because people are just inherently not

111
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:36,180
great at following state just ask the

112
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:43,690
reality guys however people are really

113
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:49,270
great at at recognizing patterns I'm

114
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:52,149
pretty sure you can all read this even

115
00:06:52,149 --> 00:06:55,390
though it is not any meaningful

116
00:06:55,390 --> 00:07:00,070
texts right just people are really good

117
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:04,510
at for example as you can see they're

118
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:07,270
really good at recognizing text even

119
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:09,730
though all of the letters in the middle

120
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:11,950
have been scrambled there are also

121
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:14,760
really good at recognizing at

122
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:19,750
recognizing faces immediately I'm always

123
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:23,560
amazed how border control officers let

124
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,780
me in and out of countries really

125
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:28,270
quickly even though in my passport my

126
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:32,920
photo looks like this but but it usually

127
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:35,650
takes them like half a second to make

128
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:37,960
sure and to know that I'm just the same

129
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:41,230
person and usually it takes solver

130
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:43,600
software because they they now have

131
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,640
those small cameras it takes the

132
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:48,180
software usually a few seconds at least

133
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:50,770
people are are also really good at

134
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:55,150
recognizing sounds if you know a song

135
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:57,970
usually you you can recognize it just

136
00:07:57,970 --> 00:08:01,000
from a--from a few beats and usually it

137
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,920
takes it takes some like 15 second

138
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:10,320
excerpt right so in all of sense we are

139
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:15,650
even a lot better than computers

140
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:19,890
recognizing various patterns and

141
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:23,200
Sciences has totally confirmed that our

142
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:26,590
brain is basically a huge and amazing

143
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:29,610
and really fast

144
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:33,520
pattern recognition machine actually

145
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,200
there have been some studies showing

146
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,020
that that our brain works were works

147
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:40,530
really like recursive probabilistic

148
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:43,150
refractor which actually science is

149
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:47,420
trying to use for for recognizing faces

150
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:53,260
so from Modi's week we can draw a pretty

151
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:56,080
simple rule that if in our programs we

152
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:00,100
use more patterns and less else clauses

153
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:03,010
it will be much easier and it will take

154
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:05,890
a lot less time for the person who reads

155
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:08,350
them to understand what is what is going

156
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:09,420
on

157
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:12,390
and by patterns I certainly not

158
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:15,330
necessarily mean design patterns but

159
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:18,960
from the Ganga for book if you're fans

160
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:23,970
of those in in my remaining time I would

161
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:28,170
try to show you a few examples of tricks

162
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:31,800
about how you can eliminate else clauses

163
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:35,700
from your progress the the first one

164
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,380
which is probably the most common and

165
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:42,990
easiest is is to emphasize the essential

166
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:46,310
part toward or the main flow of our code

167
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:49,740
here is a really typical example where

168
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:54,420
we if some data is is valid we do we we

169
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:57,150
do something with it and it's and if

170
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:59,880
it's not we return false right or no

171
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:04,080
sorry I'm sure everybody has has written

172
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,600
a lot of code for it for situations like

173
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:11,280
this and see we can the essential part

174
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:16,470
of the code is is now in pink and this

175
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:19,200
way we actually process the data the

176
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,290
rest is like there is a really neat term

177
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:24,810
called accidental complexity which is

178
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:27,120
all of the stuff we need to write all of

179
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,830
the plumbing we need to put so that our

180
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:32,100
our programs work the way we intended

181
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:35,280
them and here is a very quick way to

182
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:38,160
make sure that that our essential come

183
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,080
complexity the important part of the

184
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:44,970
code is emphasized if we if we first

185
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:48,780
bail if there are any any errors we can

186
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:51,510
achieve a few things first all of our

187
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:53,490
essential code can be can be together

188
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:56,730
also it will not be indented some

189
00:10:56,730 --> 00:10:59,100
somewhere further in in our program so

190
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:02,070
that we know if if something is is in

191
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:04,680
the mainland indentation level it is

192
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,510
probably something important and not

193
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:10,440
just a error reporting code or error

194
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:17,040
checking code the other another trick to

195
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,860
eliminate health clauses is to use

196
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:21,939
polymorphism

197
00:11:21,939 --> 00:11:24,539
actually you used to think that that

198
00:11:24,539 --> 00:11:27,309
polymorphism was a multi-headed master

199
00:11:27,309 --> 00:11:30,999
from the Greek mythology but it turned

200
00:11:30,999 --> 00:11:36,479
out that it is it is the method of of

201
00:11:36,479 --> 00:11:41,229
being able to use the same logic for for

202
00:11:41,229 --> 00:11:46,479
a data with different types and I'll

203
00:11:46,479 --> 00:11:48,429
give you another example here I'm sure

204
00:11:48,429 --> 00:11:50,769
everybody has done something like this

205
00:11:50,769 --> 00:11:53,709
we have to render a field or or whatever

206
00:11:53,709 --> 00:11:56,379
object and this field can be can be in

207
00:11:56,379 --> 00:11:58,720
different types like in our case if it's

208
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,539
a text we render an input if it's a if

209
00:12:01,539 --> 00:12:03,789
it's a number we we have our special

210
00:12:03,789 --> 00:12:06,519
component if it's a text area where we

211
00:12:06,519 --> 00:12:09,279
render a text area or we throw some some

212
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:15,399
exception so if if our goal is to

213
00:12:15,399 --> 00:12:17,889
eliminate else clauses here it'll be

214
00:12:17,889 --> 00:12:22,359
pretty hard and we can go back to

215
00:12:22,359 --> 00:12:24,909
polymorphism which to remind you it is

216
00:12:24,909 --> 00:12:27,159
to find a piece of code which can work

217
00:12:27,159 --> 00:12:30,339
somehow with with any type and the

218
00:12:30,339 --> 00:12:33,189
common pattern here is that for each

219
00:12:33,189 --> 00:12:35,859
type we have a specific component we

220
00:12:35,859 --> 00:12:40,179
just render and free for example we

221
00:12:40,179 --> 00:12:42,279
instead of keeping all of our structure

222
00:12:42,279 --> 00:12:45,159
in if clauses we can keep it in an

223
00:12:45,159 --> 00:12:49,409
object and we can use the type as a key

224
00:12:49,409 --> 00:12:52,779
I'm sure all of you have have done this

225
00:12:52,779 --> 00:12:55,029
all a lot of times it is not rocket

226
00:12:55,029 --> 00:12:57,069
rocket science and I see a lot of people

227
00:12:57,069 --> 00:13:00,159
actually do it but it's important to

228
00:13:00,159 --> 00:13:02,499
remember those tricks when when we have

229
00:13:02,499 --> 00:13:05,159
a bigger application or or we have a

230
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:08,049
really complicated to expression and we

231
00:13:08,049 --> 00:13:12,179
wanna end you want to eliminate this one

232
00:13:12,179 --> 00:13:18,159
bye-bye so if you are into into

233
00:13:18,159 --> 00:13:21,039
classical P books and stuff there are

234
00:13:21,039 --> 00:13:22,869
two things which can help you with using

235
00:13:22,869 --> 00:13:24,970
polymorphism and give you a lot of

236
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:27,429
background on this subject one of them

237
00:13:27,429 --> 00:13:30,629
is the classic strategy design pattern

238
00:13:30,629 --> 00:13:33,519
you can check out gank of the for book

239
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:35,800
if if you are

240
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,570
before just please take it with a huge

241
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:42,130
grain of salt the other classic thing

242
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:44,110
which can help you with this is the

243
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:46,570
refactoring book by Martin flower and

244
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:49,209
one of the refactoring is there is code

245
00:13:49,209 --> 00:13:51,120
replace conditional with with

246
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:54,399
polymorphism there are a ton of ideas

247
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:58,690
there about how to do that so people

248
00:13:58,690 --> 00:14:03,579
really love up patterns and actually

249
00:14:03,579 --> 00:14:06,339
they will often see patterns where none

250
00:14:06,339 --> 00:14:10,360
where no patterns actually exist for

251
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:12,870
examples for example there is

252
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:15,459
experiments showing that if you start

253
00:14:15,459 --> 00:14:19,089
showing people random dots when when

254
00:14:19,089 --> 00:14:21,700
people are overwhelmed they actually

255
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:24,730
start seeing patterns because because

256
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:26,709
our brain cannot handle a really

257
00:14:26,709 --> 00:14:29,680
complicated world how our brain is

258
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,480
always trying to make sense of the world

259
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:33,820
around us and for example way when you

260
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:36,310
get more and more dots which are totally

261
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:40,420
random for example here you don't know

262
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:42,279
that a lot of people do not see random

263
00:14:42,279 --> 00:14:44,940
dots but they start seeing poodles right

264
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:48,279
or you've seen people looking at the

265
00:14:48,279 --> 00:14:50,860
cloud and seeing are no monsters bears

266
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:54,250
or people looking at it already drunken

267
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:56,829
coffee coffee cups and trying to predict

268
00:14:56,829 --> 00:15:02,140
the future it's our way of telling it's

269
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:05,709
our way of that our brain tells us oh

270
00:15:05,709 --> 00:15:08,079
it's so too

271
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:10,510
too complicated I want to make it simple

272
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:15,310
again and here is an example where it

273
00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:18,760
could be a problem in programming let's

274
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:22,300
say we have this these are a lot of you

275
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:27,190
a lot of even our statements right so if

276
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:30,579
if a person is reading it after probably

277
00:15:30,579 --> 00:15:32,769
the second or the third they will get

278
00:15:32,769 --> 00:15:33,880
the general pattern

279
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:36,730
oh we're just checking about type right

280
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:40,180
and then something happens for for a

281
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:43,360
specific type but there is a great

282
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,570
chance they will not see that we

283
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:50,120
actually broke the pattern in few places

284
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:52,860
so with this it is really important to

285
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:55,560
have our patterns in um in in in a much

286
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:58,290
simpler ways like for example if this

287
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:02,520
was in an object we couldn't he wouldn't

288
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:06,570
be so easy for us for us to break the

289
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:14,700
pattern the next trick is to is to put

290
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:18,210
more focus on on on reaction we are

291
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:21,270
doing and not so much on the intricacies

292
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:26,640
of the logic here is an example here is

293
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:31,410
the logic of a kid in us in the ass

294
00:16:31,410 --> 00:16:33,600
spring season basically anywhere in the

295
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,120
world if it's a weekday it goes to

296
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:39,450
school if it's not a weekday but if it's

297
00:16:39,450 --> 00:16:42,120
a Saturday it plays it plays football

298
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:44,640
and if it's raining it watches TV

299
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:47,610
because they can play food football and

300
00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:50,400
on Sunday obviously kids have to do

301
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,980
their homework some some times and if

302
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:55,110
it's winter we like like birds really

303
00:16:55,110 --> 00:17:00,720
like to hibernate so how how can we make

304
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:04,290
this simpler because when you look at it

305
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:07,410
you don't see any any actual pattern it

306
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:09,660
is just a random logic going back and

307
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:13,590
back and forth and here is what we can

308
00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:15,630
do we can just focus on the action

309
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:20,070
themselves and and not so much on the

310
00:17:20,070 --> 00:17:28,560
conditions people humans are are pretty

311
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:30,900
bad at keeping state so they usually try

312
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:33,600
to avoid it and very often we are pretty

313
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:38,520
explicit us in what we say so we will

314
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:41,610
usually not say that oh if it is spring

315
00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:44,010
I will go and and if it's a weekday I

316
00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:49,170
will go somewhere in instead we usually

317
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:52,140
say Oh on a spring on a spring shower

318
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:55,680
Saturday I would go play football and

319
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:58,530
you can see here that it is really easy

320
00:17:58,530 --> 00:18:01,400
to see the pattern of all the import

321
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:06,870
stuff and these are the actions right

322
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:10,160
sometimes it is really hard to escape

323
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:13,250
the conditionals and and we don't have

324
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:17,030
to go into too much trouble so if there

325
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:19,640
is no visible way to escape from them at

326
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:22,190
least the least we can do is is to

327
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:24,230
simplify and make everything shorter by

328
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:28,360
by extracting stuff we we can extract

329
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:31,760
methods for example this monstrous thing

330
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:34,970
can just happen this by extracting a

331
00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:37,880
function in the middle and giving it a

332
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:41,630
proper name or or or we can extract a

333
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:44,210
conditional and again giving it up a

334
00:18:44,210 --> 00:18:49,520
proper name if people tell you that they

335
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:52,700
don't like so much abstraction it is

336
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:55,340
really important to point out that this

337
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:57,350
is simply rection and not abstraction

338
00:18:57,350 --> 00:18:59,060
we're not observe abstracting thing too

339
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:01,970
much we're just putting it inside the in

340
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:04,820
a very well named functions and usually

341
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:09,590
it is pretty obvious what do they do as

342
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:12,710
a closing I would like to say that

343
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:15,890
writing code is actually a lot closer to

344
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:19,010
user experience and usability then then

345
00:19:19,010 --> 00:19:24,380
we think because our crosses sits a

346
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:27,560
normal person and we need to make sure

347
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:30,920
that when when they read our code it is

348
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:35,060
easy for them to understand then and it

349
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:39,260
doesn't take them too much time in the

350
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:42,260
end people are a lot more important than

351
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:45,470
than computers and as mr. rubb about

352
00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:47,960
sincerity in the really great structure

353
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:49,780
and interpretation of computer programs

354
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:53,150
that computer programs are written for

355
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:56,270
for people to read and only accidentally
