1
00:00:02,510 --> 00:00:06,270

okay right now it should be better so I

2
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:09,240
know you're already tired but who of you

3
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:12,210
have some rock'n'roll metal grunge

4
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:15,830
whatever come on

5
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:20,720
okay let's try to make some noise

6
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:25,210
[Music]

7
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:28,280
[Applause]

8
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:28,900
[Music]

9
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:29,830
[Applause]

10
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:48,400
[Music]

11
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:54,010
okay so this talk I will show you how to

12
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:59,540
sell your amp and process music life

13
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:02,000
your instrument with JavaScript

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,920
so before we start few words about

15
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,580
myself my name is Vitaly I came from

16
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:10,100
Poland and Here I am working as the

17
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:13,130
leads of 20 engineer at company called a

18
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:14,150
pump systems

19
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:16,370
I also Corgan eyes in angular Brussels

20
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:19,910
meetups and disclaimer I'm not a

21
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:22,369
professional guitar player so don't

22
00:01:22,369 --> 00:01:26,660
judge me it's just a hobby and I used to

23
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:29,330
play punk rock groups when I was a

24
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:32,240
teenager you can find me on Twitter and

25
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,790
you can read my blog actually here I

26
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:38,300
started to blog posting some information

27
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:40,220
regarding this topic that I will show

28
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:41,080
today

29
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:45,920
okay so Web Audio yeah it's exists for a

30
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,940
while in web standards most of browsers

31
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:52,940
get a good supports of it so what is it

32
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:55,460
actually it's provide us with the

33
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:58,850
context with which you can create a uni

34
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:03,140
directed graph with audio knows those

35
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:07,940
audio notes could be get together to

36
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:11,690
create some effects create generate some

37
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:15,380
music or process live stream how it

38
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:18,080
looks like we have some input in my case

39
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:21,440
it's guitar it might be generated sound

40
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:24,130
with oscillators and we have an output

41
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:28,730
our speakers headphones whatever and

42
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:30,880
between that we have some nodes

43
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:33,200
connected these nodes we can achieve

44
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:37,130
some effects and audio processing if you

45
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:40,250
take a look at real guitar stock we have

46
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:42,620
a guitar we have some amplifiers

47
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:46,040
cabinets and between them we have some

48
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,980
stone boxes with some effects like

49
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:51,890
Kouros distortion and so on

50
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:55,010
so how we can actually connect

51
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:59,090
instrument this could be applied to any

52
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:01,580
instrument actually that could be

53
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:04,430
connected to an order cards but in my

54
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:08,390
case is Peter okay first of all we need

55
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:11,660
to create audio context audio context is

56
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:13,460
the main object that allows you to

57
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:17,480
create new nodes connect them and put it

58
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:20,930
to some destination so we create this

59
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:21,710
context

60
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:28,190
after that we request some stream in and

61
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:30,950
we will use navigator media devices and

62
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:33,800
we are requesting audio in my case we

63
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:37,100
you can also request video but I don't

64
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:39,200
need it that is why I don't show it and

65
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:43,160
textually you can catch errors if you

66
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:45,920
don't grant permissions to audio or

67
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:49,330
something against wrong so it's optional

68
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:53,630
that's fine but hey wait I got some

69
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:57,019
audio constraints for you what I mean by

70
00:03:57,019 --> 00:04:00,019
that so that's completely fine you can

71
00:04:00,019 --> 00:04:03,440
request audio using just get media audio

72
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:07,370
true but by default most of browsers

73
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:10,370
apply some post-processing for input

74
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:13,700
stream it's completely fine for

75
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:16,459
microphone for chatting application like

76
00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:20,419
hangout Skype but for web borders they

77
00:04:20,419 --> 00:04:23,900
will reduce amount of our signal which

78
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:26,510
we want to use so instead to passing

79
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:28,340
just through we need to pass some

80
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:31,790
constraints to remove echo cancellation

81
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:35,120
after gain control noise suspension and

82
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:39,770
provide some latency hint doing that we

83
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:42,710
get the most clean sound as we can from

84
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:47,990
our instrument after that we get some

85
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:52,280
stream we have a context and we need to

86
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:56,410
connect this stream to destination

87
00:04:56,410 --> 00:05:00,640
context destination is a default output

88
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,990
selected in your system

89
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:05,090
for example now it should output to the

90
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:09,440
speakers one more thing

91
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,720
usually we need to control the amount of

92
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:16,310
volume to not hurry our neighbors for

93
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:20,330
example at night so how to do this we

94
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:22,880
can imagine the audio signal as sine

95
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:26,690
wave yeah and the amplitude of this sine

96
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:29,680
wave is actually the amount of volume

97
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:33,670
for the sound so multiplying it or

98
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:36,770
dividing by some numbers will reduce the

99
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:40,100
amplitude and reducing the amplitude we

100
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:42,860
reduce the amount of volume how it looks

101
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:46,430
like in code so Web Audio provide us

102
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:50,030
with gain note we create an again node

103
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:54,620
and then we can apply again value the

104
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:56,780
value of zero means that our sound

105
00:05:56,780 --> 00:06:00,860
completely muted the value of one means

106
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:03,410
that the sound not changed the volume is

107
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:06,500
as it is so by putting the values

108
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:09,020
between zero and one we can control the

109
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:11,990
amount of volume or even more we can add

110
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:14,420
add some values more than one and

111
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:18,890
amplify our sound so when we create such

112
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:21,650
a node we need to connect our graph so

113
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:24,020
we have source we connect it to gain

114
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:26,260
node and after that connect to

115
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:31,640
destination so let's let me show how it

116
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,010
looks like

117
00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:40,030
in real life okay so I connected clean

118
00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:45,060
sound so it's nice and what

119
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:56,810
[Music]

120
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:59,740
and they have this master volume control

121
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:03,250
so now it's a value of one and I can

122
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:08,280
reduce it to make it

123
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:13,580
or even muted completely no sound and

124
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:20,840
come back to one okay let's miss fish to

125
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:27,369
slice again okay

126
00:07:27,369 --> 00:07:30,409
so the first effect I want to show how

127
00:07:30,409 --> 00:07:32,089
to create with a buff order is

128
00:07:32,089 --> 00:07:35,990
distortion distortion often reused in

129
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:38,270
some rock music metal and so on

130
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:41,330
so actually it's a group of effects that

131
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:43,699
change our input sine-wave

132
00:07:43,699 --> 00:07:46,339
with some transfer function and this

133
00:07:46,339 --> 00:07:50,300
process called wave shape so bit of

134
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:52,430
history about this effect back in test

135
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:56,419
times the equipment for guitarists

136
00:07:56,419 --> 00:07:59,559
wasn't there bad is it good sorry and

137
00:07:59,559 --> 00:08:01,849
when it was broken

138
00:08:01,849 --> 00:08:04,490
for example speaker was cut off the

139
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:07,399
sound became disordered but get replaced

140
00:08:07,399 --> 00:08:10,639
while like this effect so much so they

141
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:13,099
started to destroy the speaker's

142
00:08:13,099 --> 00:08:16,699
themself that's how it was born only

143
00:08:16,699 --> 00:08:19,330
after few years the first the

144
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:22,249
semiconductor effect the in form of

145
00:08:22,249 --> 00:08:25,069
pedal was done by different producers

146
00:08:25,069 --> 00:08:27,379
but now you don't mean that

147
00:08:27,379 --> 00:08:31,189
you can use just Web Audio okay as I

148
00:08:31,189 --> 00:08:33,949
said before distortion is a group of

149
00:08:33,949 --> 00:08:37,219
effects it contains of overdrive

150
00:08:37,219 --> 00:08:40,459
distortion and fuss so what is the

151
00:08:40,459 --> 00:08:44,750
difference between them again we can

152
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:47,839
imagine how a sound wave as a sine wave

153
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:54,019
and we apply wave shaping a function to

154
00:08:54,019 --> 00:08:57,860
our wave until become more square doing

155
00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:00,290
that with generating harmonics what is

156
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:04,220
harmonic I will sound of some instrument

157
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:06,139
for example it doesn't have only one

158
00:09:06,139 --> 00:09:09,050
frequency it has one a domain frequency

159
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:12,829
and a bunch of harmonics as a

160
00:09:12,829 --> 00:09:14,930
frequencies with possibly lower

161
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:18,819
amplitude and during wave shaping we

162
00:09:18,819 --> 00:09:22,480
increase amount of harmonics so our

163
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:26,660
original wave become more richer and

164
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:28,180
harder

165
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:31,510
so difference between overdrive

166
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:35,220
distortion and fuss if we will see on

167
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:37,570
Soundwave after we apply transfer

168
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:40,360
function of different types for

169
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:43,300
overdrive it will be more curved for

170
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:44,110
Distortion

171
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:47,500
slightly more Square and for fuss it

172
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:50,980
will be almost completely square so this

173
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:57,130
such changes in a wave shape we be

174
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:59,110
reducing or increasing amount of

175
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:01,750
harmonics we are to original sound and

176
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:03,910
more harmonics we add to it

177
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:08,800
more effect under sound we achieve how

178
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,380
it looks like with web order so we have

179
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:15,040
a know some web shaper note provided by

180
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,260
Web Audio why it's awesome you just

181
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:21,070
provided a lookup table with values

182
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:23,670
calculated beforehand for harmonics

183
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:27,690
which of transfer function and Web Audio

184
00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:31,180
applies it using fast Fourier transforms

185
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:35,350
to your source input so most of hard

186
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:38,410
work a hidden and done for you by Web

187
00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:42,540
Audio API so we creating some wave

188
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:45,670
lookout table and assign it adds a curve

189
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:49,590
for way shape or node so how look this

190
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:53,110
function would be so we have some amount

191
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:56,290
of gain we want to add we have number of

192
00:10:56,290 --> 00:10:59,530
samples for a lookup table and we filled

193
00:10:59,530 --> 00:11:02,200
with our transfer function so basically

194
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:06,570
we apply floating 32 array to a curve

195
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:11,680
and that's it after that usually those

196
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,720
effects distortions they have at least

197
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:17,440
one control for tone and again hard done

198
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,560
hard work done for you you have big vat

199
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:24,040
filter note it a basic node for creating

200
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:26,260
different types of filters so we

201
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:28,960
creating a low pass filter low pass

202
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:32,430
filter except some frequency and

203
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:36,580
everything below that frequency will be

204
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:40,240
passed through every since that hires at

205
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,529
this frequency we

206
00:11:41,529 --> 00:11:43,930
we'll be cut off so Morgan's this

207
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:46,360
frequency we're reducing or increasing

208
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:50,079
the amount of high frequencies mid

209
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:54,610
frequencies and low frequencies and the

210
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:57,939
interesting thing that real stompboxes

211
00:11:57,939 --> 00:12:00,939
also at least some of them using such

212
00:12:00,939 --> 00:12:04,439
kind of low-pass filtering but mate with

213
00:12:04,439 --> 00:12:12,689
some reduced capacitors and resistors so

214
00:12:12,689 --> 00:12:15,069
basically we're doing the same but in

215
00:12:15,069 --> 00:12:18,430
the code in a different way so let's try

216
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:20,970
to see what the difference between

217
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:25,930
OverDrive's distortion sent so first I

218
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:30,120
have some overdrive enabled yeah

219
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:32,280
[Music]

220
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:35,360
could we make it louder slightly

221
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:52,230
[Music]

222
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:56,320
so here I apply and the most soft

223
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:00,350
transfer function I can so it's just not

224
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:05,330
the big difference between sound and we

225
00:13:05,330 --> 00:13:07,520
add in not that much harmonics but let's

226
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:11,029
try another one this more harder

227
00:13:11,029 --> 00:13:11,900
function

228
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:15,220
[Applause]

229
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:17,440
[Music]

230
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,700
[Applause]

231
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:20,010
[Music]

232
00:13:20,010 --> 00:13:20,800
[Applause]

233
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,750
[Music]

234
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:28,740
so our sound is more harder and when I

235
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:30,950
change in the amount of effect I

236
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:34,850
statically generated cupcake so we can

237
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:38,280
use more amount I just recovered

238
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:40,710
recalculating this lookup table after

239
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:41,610
yet

240
00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:42,320
[Music]

241
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,060
[Applause]

242
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:46,760
and here we have tone control yeah Oh

243
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:50,390
way up we have all frequencies no of our

244
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:53,360
guitar frequencies reduced

245
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:57,610
[Music]

246
00:13:57,620 --> 00:14:00,890
it sounds slightly harsh and if we

247
00:14:00,890 --> 00:14:05,060
reduce the amount of frequencies it will

248
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:06,370
be some modest sound

249
00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:13,040
[Music]

250
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:16,820
so again with just one filter we change

251
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:18,800
our sound

252
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:19,970
different ways

253
00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:23,120
[Applause]

254
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:25,840
those bows OverDrive's

255
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:28,940
now let's try some dystocia

256
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:38,290
[Music]

257
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:41,379
so our sound became more harder more

258
00:14:41,379 --> 00:14:44,259
heavy and that's the basically

259
00:14:44,259 --> 00:14:46,089
difference between overdrive and

260
00:14:46,089 --> 00:14:47,019
Distortion

261
00:14:47,019 --> 00:14:50,100
let's try another one

262
00:14:50,100 --> 00:15:04,200
[Music]

263
00:15:04,210 --> 00:15:12,160
okay and the last one fuss

264
00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:23,980
[Music]

265
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:27,890
more heavier and more like digital

266
00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:31,100
because this our sound shape become

267
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:32,840
almost square

268
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:40,990
[Music]

269
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,550
and again we have tone control but in

270
00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:49,100
this case is slightly different control

271
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:49,660
variant

272
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:59,210
[Music]

273
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:06,910
we can make it almost

274
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:15,850
[Applause]

275
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:25,740
okay that was some distortions okay but

276
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:30,270
to make our sound more closer to real

277
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:33,630
devices we would like to create some

278
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:38,130
cabinet or amplifier simulation and we

279
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:40,650
can do it using special thing called

280
00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:42,360
impulse response

281
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:44,850
what is impulse response is a short

282
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:47,940
sample containing just few milliseconds

283
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:51,090
of a sound of a real device

284
00:16:51,090 --> 00:16:55,890
I mean speaker of Geezer cabinet so if

285
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:58,710
you think about you can think about it

286
00:16:58,710 --> 00:17:02,850
like photo photo is a snapshot of fly

287
00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:07,980
light at some point of time impulse

288
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:11,430
response is the same but applies for the

289
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:13,949
sound so it's a snapshot of some sound

290
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:17,839
in some space at some point of time so

291
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:22,170
and again Web Audio save us and hide a

292
00:17:22,170 --> 00:17:25,199
lot of complicated work behind the

293
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:28,560
scenes we can use convo or not we create

294
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:31,110
this can louver node then we load this

295
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:35,040
impulse response file we create a ray

296
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:38,400
buffer free then we decode it and apply

297
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:44,400
this buffer to a lot so all the sounds

298
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,710
that will go through this controller

299
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:50,760
node will be goes through this impulse

300
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:53,060
response so it will be adjusted

301
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:58,410
accordingly to our sample and next thing

302
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:00,930
usually amplifies has at least three

303
00:18:00,930 --> 00:18:03,720
band Equalization so to have more

304
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:07,200
control over our tone stack on either

305
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,410
cabinet we want to create some 3-band

306
00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:14,160
equalizer so basically we need to split

307
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:19,440
our frequency range into three bands for

308
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:22,290
everything below 500 gals

309
00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:24,990
it will be for bus control everything

310
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:26,789
above 300

311
00:18:26,789 --> 00:18:29,159
we'll go for treble control everything

312
00:18:29,159 --> 00:18:33,359
in the middle will be middle how it

313
00:18:33,359 --> 00:18:36,959
looks like in code again we using big

314
00:18:36,959 --> 00:18:39,539
fat filter node but now we using another

315
00:18:39,539 --> 00:18:42,479
types of them for our bus node we using

316
00:18:42,479 --> 00:18:45,449
low shelf filter wall shelf filter takes

317
00:18:45,449 --> 00:18:48,329
a frequency and everything below that

318
00:18:48,329 --> 00:18:51,359
frequency will be attenuated or

319
00:18:51,359 --> 00:18:54,209
amplified depending on again value we

320
00:18:54,209 --> 00:18:56,789
did for it so we can adjust the amount

321
00:18:56,789 --> 00:19:01,289
of those frequencies the opposite thing

322
00:19:01,289 --> 00:19:04,679
we do for high frequencies with high

323
00:19:04,679 --> 00:19:08,339
shelf filter so it takes the frequency

324
00:19:08,339 --> 00:19:10,919
and everything above that frequency will

325
00:19:10,919 --> 00:19:14,549
be updated or amplified for middle range

326
00:19:14,549 --> 00:19:17,909
we using peaking filter so it takes the

327
00:19:17,909 --> 00:19:21,289
middle frequency of our range and

328
00:19:21,289 --> 00:19:24,779
everything inside this range will be

329
00:19:24,779 --> 00:19:29,159
amplified or attenuated okay let's try

330
00:19:29,159 --> 00:19:29,789
it out

331
00:19:29,789 --> 00:19:32,449
and try to see the difference between

332
00:19:32,449 --> 00:19:36,060
different cabinets

333
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:39,540
okay

334
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:43,720
let's start for the screen so here I

335
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:46,640
mean

336
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:57,980
turn off any cabinet emulation now

337
00:19:57,990 --> 00:19:59,220
[Music]

338
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:01,510
minutes

339
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:05,750
[Music]

340
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,710
then I can switch to another one for

341
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:12,010
example

342
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:16,370
it sound differently so those samples

343
00:20:16,370 --> 00:20:21,360
made from real devices versus darker

344
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:26,370
sound maybe it won't be the possible

345
00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:28,860
without in any effect so let's enable

346
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:40,950
some effect so now we have really really

347
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:44,460
dark come as you are let's try something

348
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:46,450
more whiter

349
00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:57,700
[Music]

350
00:20:57,710 --> 00:21:10,139
let's try more lighter one and let's try

351
00:21:10,139 --> 00:21:14,399
ours we went equalizer so let me reduce

352
00:21:14,399 --> 00:21:21,480
the amount of needle domes damnit

353
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:24,260
[Music]

354
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:27,990
or if your increasing it will be more

355
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:36,510
bright we can increase the amount of

356
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:41,730
bass

357
00:21:41,740 --> 00:22:00,500
and trebles okay

358
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:05,220
let's switch back to the slides

359
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:07,840
and the last thing I want to show is a

360
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,640
rib abrasion what is the reverberation

361
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:14,350
is the effect that tries to simulate

362
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:17,200
some spaces for example now we are in

363
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:20,860
hole yeah and this space has its own

364
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:23,500
acoustic properties

365
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:26,110
so this reverberation we can emulate

366
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:31,630
such spaces like holes football court

367
00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:35,470
for example or something else is this

368
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:38,590
effect would be slightly more

369
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:40,630
complicated so basically we want to

370
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:43,410
split our source sound into two lines

371
00:22:43,410 --> 00:22:46,720
there wet one this effect and dry one

372
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:47,830
without effect

373
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:51,790
just clean sound so for wet tone we will

374
00:22:51,790 --> 00:22:56,650
create some GA note actually when you

375
00:22:56,650 --> 00:22:59,620
speaking in some hole as the sound goes

376
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:03,160
to the back wall and come to you back

377
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:05,760
with some delays that creates for us

378
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:10,590
meaning of the space inside some rooms

379
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:13,270
after that we will filter it slightly

380
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:17,080
and again apply convolve or not but now

381
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:20,140
we will use the impulse responses from

382
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:23,710
different places usually this sample is

383
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:26,679
just some clap few milliseconds of a

384
00:23:26,679 --> 00:23:30,510
clap in different space and a plant can

385
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:33,640
convolution on it we will get the

386
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:36,790
simulation of the space then we will

387
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:41,610
merge back or wet and dry tones and

388
00:23:41,610 --> 00:23:44,460
reducing the gain on wet and dry we will

389
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:47,260
control the amount of effect we want to

390
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:52,419
apply to the source so how it looks like

391
00:23:52,419 --> 00:23:55,630
first of all we create splitter node to

392
00:23:55,630 --> 00:23:58,090
split our Channel sound into two

393
00:23:58,090 --> 00:24:03,490
channels then we are do a note tone note

394
00:24:03,490 --> 00:24:07,260
with big fat filter controller note and

395
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:10,150
the gain control to control amount of

396
00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:12,059
effect sound

397
00:24:12,059 --> 00:24:15,359
and try not to control the amount of

398
00:24:15,359 --> 00:24:18,840
clean sound and we create major to March

399
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:21,210
it back after that we need to connect

400
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:24,509
them so splitter connect to do a delay

401
00:24:24,509 --> 00:24:27,570
to tone tone to convert convert wet and

402
00:24:27,570 --> 00:24:29,999
back to measure and in the second fly we

403
00:24:29,999 --> 00:24:34,109
connect dry and back to merger okay

404
00:24:34,109 --> 00:24:38,940
let's show how the reverberation changes

405
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:47,809
the sound okay let me try this preset so

406
00:24:47,809 --> 00:24:51,950
firstly I will show how to sound without

407
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:54,929
reverberation yeah it's kind of so I'm

408
00:24:54,929 --> 00:25:01,180
not that good at source but anyway

409
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:12,010
is a turn table

410
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:16,050
why is the reason all sound

411
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:24,989
is there any input

412
00:25:24,999 --> 00:25:30,140
okay

413
00:25:30,150 --> 00:25:36,410
now yeah okay let's try it

414
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:49,520
[Music]

415
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:50,960
okay

416
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:53,630
this was the variant without regression

417
00:25:53,630 --> 00:25:56,810
let's add the reverberation emulation of

418
00:25:56,810 --> 00:26:12,050
West

419
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:19,019
[Music]

420
00:26:19,019 --> 00:26:25,149
okay and another example here I will

421
00:26:25,149 --> 00:26:27,789
show again without your vibration and

422
00:26:27,789 --> 00:26:31,809
twist and I will simulate how this

423
00:26:31,809 --> 00:26:35,810
vibration

424
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:42,570
[Music]

425
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:43,970


426
00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:43,980
[Music]

427
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:48,410
[Applause]

428
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:53,299
[Music]

429
00:26:53,299 --> 00:27:00,550
okay and now we will try to break

430
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:07,530
[Music]

431
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:22,900


432
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:22,910
[Music]

433
00:27:22,910 --> 00:27:28,080
and we can adjust the amount of space we

434
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,360
want to simulate visit away time

435
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:32,790
so let's write for example there 10

436
00:27:32,790 --> 00:27:40,020
milliseconds

437
00:27:40,030 --> 00:27:49,330
[Music]

438
00:27:49,330 --> 00:27:58,000
okay and let's switch to slides back so

439
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,679
should recap what we learned today

440
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:03,320
so we learnt what is web audio how to

441
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:06,620
connect your instrument to process it in

442
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:09,519
real time this Web Audio how to control

443
00:28:09,519 --> 00:28:12,529
amount of volume using gain node how to

444
00:28:12,529 --> 00:28:15,350
create basic distortion effects using

445
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:18,019
wave shaper and controlled tone of

446
00:28:18,019 --> 00:28:20,629
effect using big wad filter node how to

447
00:28:20,629 --> 00:28:23,720
simulate real guitar cabinets and

448
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:26,779
amplifiers using curved over node how to

449
00:28:26,779 --> 00:28:29,929
create reverberation effect using merger

450
00:28:29,929 --> 00:28:33,830
splitter and delay nodes and that's

451
00:28:33,830 --> 00:28:39,970
basically what I have be 10x engineers

452
00:28:39,970 --> 00:28:44,659
but better to be a rock star engineers

453
00:28:44,659 --> 00:28:48,500
using Web Audio so write out all the

454
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:51,889
code available on github the app is open

455
00:28:51,889 --> 00:28:54,500
source I'm open to pull request is we

456
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:57,649
want to create a new effect or fix any

457
00:28:57,649 --> 00:29:01,070
issues for example mobile version it's

458
00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:03,860
hard for me to create right now and all

459
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:06,769
these controls so check it out thank you

460
00:29:06,769 --> 00:29:08,840
very much for coming and enjoy a

461
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:11,630
conference

462
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:12,440
[Applause]
