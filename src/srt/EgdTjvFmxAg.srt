00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:20,550

hello everyone it's nice to be here in

2
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:23,160
the philippines my name is Cheech one

3
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:26,400
and today my topic will be web movements

4
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,650
in China so it's more like a more

5
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:31,529
general topic here and first let's just

6
00:00:31,529 --> 00:00:34,110
make less let me make yourself

7
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:39,149
introduction by myself and I'm a founder

8
00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:41,670
of adding planning platform in China and

9
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:44,340
is the startup company i co-founded

10
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:47,219
least a couple of friends and I'm also a

11
00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:49,230
partner of a game development company in

12
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:55,200
Beijing and I I basically do coding at

13
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:58,020
my spare time so I'm collector I'm

14
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:01,340
creator of a Jes patents collection I

15
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:04,769
first I do it as a rep as a self

16
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:07,350
reference but somehow after i publish to

17
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:09,060
github it has been used by a lot of

18
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:12,469
people and it becomes a quite popular a

19
00:01:12,469 --> 00:01:15,420
connection right now on github and if

20
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:17,729
you find it interesting you can check it

21
00:01:17,729 --> 00:01:20,850
out on github it basically collects all

22
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:23,010
the JavaScript patterns like jQuery

23
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:26,159
patterns and a lot object creation

24
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:30,570
patterns as well and and in the past i

25
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:33,869
initialize the delta boilerplate a

26
00:01:33,869 --> 00:01:37,650
project for the smartphones and it was

27
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:40,260
originally developed with a parish and

28
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:42,690
divya and now because I have my own

29
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:45,119
startup running and I didn't have much

30
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:47,640
time but it's carried on by alex gibson

31
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:50,400
and many other developers who continue

32
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:54,990
to work on this project and i'm also a

33
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:57,659
book author of html5 mobile development

34
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:00,630
cookbook and also reviewed book for the

35
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:04,259
same publisher in the past and since

36
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:06,450
this is jas kong asia i just want to

37
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:13,379
talk about something in asia so only

38
00:02:13,379 --> 00:02:14,640
talk about something about the web

39
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,370
development in china and here is like

40
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:20,340
the browser's text in China right now it

41
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,110
looks a bit depressing because it seems

42
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:24,270
like I ate and I e-cigs are still kind

43
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:26,640
of like the most popular browsers a

44
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,990
chrome is catching

45
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:33,890
up in the country but even though html5

46
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:36,540
html5 started well supported in the

47
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:39,720
region yet but somehow the big web

48
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,580
companies and startups are trying really

49
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:45,420
hard to to to work on cross platform

50
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:49,050
solutions as well as using html5 in a

51
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:54,030
lot of web applications and first of all

52
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:56,220
talk about like html5 in like big tech

53
00:02:56,220 --> 00:03:00,510
companies in in China it's like Alibaba

54
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:01,800
is the one of the biggest e-commerce

55
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:04,760
website is basically a combination of

56
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:09,150
amazon.com and paypal in China so it's

57
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:11,490
really huge and recently is converted

58
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:17,220
all is html5 text to HT HT HTML tags to

59
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:22,320
html5 cymatics tension is another huge

60
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:25,470
company and it starts as a chat

61
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:28,800
application a desktop software but after

62
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,470
it gained popularity in the country it

63
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:34,920
has developed into a web platform and

64
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:39,000
it's almost like a web version of the

65
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,640
operating system I just want to do like

66
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:48,660
a couple demos of how how it works so it

67
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:51,960
basically has like photo editors and

68
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:55,530
music players and it says like a clock

69
00:03:55,530 --> 00:04:00,150
and of course it's chat system on this

70
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:06,930
Web OS as well and basically it

71
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:09,450
developed like RSS readers and like

72
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:14,040
music box and video players as well or

73
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:21,690
in 10 e 1 Y browser I'm sorry

74
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:24,670
and recently it uses all the latest like

75
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:30,370
html5 technologies for instance it used

76
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:32,830
the notification API for its chat system

77
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:37,930
and it also uses the the geolocation API

78
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:43,420
for its map and the Audio API for is

79
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:47,230
music player and for this core chat

80
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:50,770
application online it uses a WebSocket

81
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:53,890
by default for browsers that support

82
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:59,230
html5 and it uses flash enabled flesh

83
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:01,120
sockets for browsers that doesn't

84
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,180
support html5 browsers and it uses like

85
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:08,520
long polling for like no flash browsers

86
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:12,820
and of course it is asleep is uses like

87
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:17,050
css3 video API canvas API in WebGL 48

88
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:23,380
games and other applications but that is

89
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:25,810
quite common as we all seen those things

90
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:28,090
in the in other parts of the world as

91
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:30,850
well but what is more exciting is about

92
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:33,880
how startups come up with more creative

93
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:37,660
solutions for problem solving and one

94
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:41,070
problem we know that when we are doing a

95
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:44,050
smartphone application is that if you're

96
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:45,970
running it in the browser itself on a

97
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:48,790
smartphone the performance can be a

98
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:51,880
problem especially in like Asian

99
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,680
countries like people are kind of like

100
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,590
more pragmatic you know like they care

101
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:59,650
about the development course edited the

102
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:03,640
development costs and as well as how can

103
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:06,580
you find such good developers who can

104
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:09,430
make it like work smoothly and no

105
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:13,420
flickering problems and so this startup

106
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:15,220
called app can come up with a quite

107
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:17,230
interesting solution it's basically a

108
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:19,630
hybrid smartphone solution and it works

109
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:25,120
for iOS Android and Windows 8 and it is

110
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:28,330
bit similar to a phonegap but is but it

111
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:31,540
also has some kind of difference so with

112
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:34,060
these kind of solutions like this has

113
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,590
become like cliche like

114
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:38,740
web versus native because this app can

115
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:42,310
has basically a App Engine so basically

116
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:44,290
you're right you're called in html5 and

117
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:49,480
css3 and can compile it into a app using

118
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,460
the app engine and it comes with the

119
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:55,330
developer SDK as well and as well as app

120
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:58,990
analytics and it has also its own push

121
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:02,500
notification but we all know that

122
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,690
phonegap can pretty much do the same

123
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:06,880
thing so what is like the difference

124
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:10,270
like if you're using phonegap most

125
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:12,250
probably you are building a what all in

126
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:15,010
one page application so basically is in

127
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:18,130
HTML that you you can hold it into a

128
00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:20,770
webview and it works with jquery and

129
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:23,610
sencha touch and other third-party

130
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:32,050
frameworks and it's open source well

131
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:35,080
this all in one page plus third-party UI

132
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:38,560
framework approach has an pros and cons

133
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,330
the good thing is that this approach

134
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:42,430
works fine in demos and small

135
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:44,650
applications and but if you're building

136
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:47,440
a large application and which may

137
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,500
require multi views and no flickering

138
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,960
transitions then this become a little

139
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:57,070
bit of a problem and as we all know this

140
00:07:57,070 --> 00:08:00,910
is how like a typical Android multi

141
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:02,980
webview development work place looks

142
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:05,190
like that you have all these layout

143
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:08,770
files which is like the web views and

144
00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:10,570
you have the Java activities that

145
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:22,080
correspond to your layout

146
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:24,400
phonegap does have a solution although

147
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:28,330
is not commonly used by people for

148
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:31,540
Android web views phonegap uses a diva

149
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:34,630
webview and for iOS web use it uses

150
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:37,210
cleaver component but these are not

151
00:08:37,210 --> 00:08:39,279
really commonly used and it's not like

152
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:42,250
but they work as more like components

153
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:45,850
instead of the core application and how

154
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:48,550
ab can does this is that by default it

155
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:52,750
has a multiple web view API and it has

156
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:55,540
the native app can you I which is a

157
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:58,270
building UI framework it's not open

158
00:08:58,270 --> 00:08:59,980
source at the moment but it's kind of

159
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:07,060
afraid to use basically this is how the

160
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:12,040
multiple value API looks like so with

161
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:16,960
this development SDK you instead of

162
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:19,330
having one index 2.html you actually

163
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:22,630
have like multiple htmls which work as

164
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:25,570
different web views and corresponding

165
00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:27,790
there there is this JavaScript which

166
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:30,720
works there's activity and us the you

167
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:34,529
the the UI framework built in as well

168
00:09:34,529 --> 00:09:38,440
and because of there's something running

169
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,089
in the background so it solves the

170
00:09:40,089 --> 00:09:41,950
flickering problem as well when you

171
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:44,589
actually translating from one webview to

172
00:09:44,589 --> 00:09:53,589
another and this is how the UI framework

173
00:09:53,589 --> 00:09:58,089
API looks like basically this is how the

174
00:09:58,089 --> 00:10:03,910
native API you I API works on a very

175
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:06,640
basic layer there's a red resolution

176
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,430
adapter class and on top of that you can

177
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:11,709
find the base class the color class the

178
00:10:11,709 --> 00:10:15,190
layout and resolution class and also on

179
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:17,170
top of that you have the control class

180
00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:19,900
which controls the buttons least fold

181
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:23,670
inputs tab radio box check box and

182
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:26,620
switch classes and you can write your

183
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:32,709
own custom class as well so which is

184
00:10:32,709 --> 00:10:34,720
better I think I love

185
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,459
phonegap before it's open-source nature

186
00:10:36,459 --> 00:10:39,519
and the only one page solution is really

187
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:41,800
easy for like entry-level developers and

188
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,769
the flexibility is really great for

189
00:10:43,769 --> 00:10:48,819
top-level developers app can is is more

190
00:10:48,819 --> 00:10:50,829
like it's a bit like a free enterprise

191
00:10:50,829 --> 00:10:53,529
product is good for mid-level developers

192
00:10:53,529 --> 00:10:57,850
I think so it's really your own choice

193
00:10:57,850 --> 00:11:00,250
like what use but I think it's quite

194
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:03,220
interesting to to learn a tool to have a

195
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:05,529
look at both because they use different

196
00:11:05,529 --> 00:11:08,470
approaches and and I think they can

197
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:12,910
learn a lot from each other and there

198
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:14,230
are a lot of quite interesting apps

199
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:17,290
viewed by just made in JavaScript itself

200
00:11:17,290 --> 00:11:19,509
in China like one of these is called

201
00:11:19,509 --> 00:11:21,819
like daily cost and it's building

202
00:11:21,819 --> 00:11:24,220
JavaScript and it's written by just one

203
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:26,470
single person from the design to

204
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:29,350
development and to the marketing self

205
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:32,100
and it's like half a million downloads

206
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:37,810
in the country and well if you say like

207
00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:40,959
I don't even give know about ie 6 and 8

208
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:43,329
users is still fine because like in

209
00:11:43,329 --> 00:11:46,660
China and many Asian countries like even

210
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:48,459
a niche market is still like bigger than

211
00:11:48,459 --> 00:11:50,559
most conscious entire population like

212
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:54,490
Indonesia China Japan so even if you

213
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:56,410
just build like an application that's

214
00:11:56,410 --> 00:11:59,920
totally just it does only supposed html5

215
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:03,189
but not other browsers still can be a

216
00:12:03,189 --> 00:12:06,430
quite heat like for instance one music

217
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:10,689
player built by a by a developer in

218
00:12:10,689 --> 00:12:13,240
China called qingdao FM which is quite

219
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:15,490
interesting it's like a music player

220
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:18,399
built entirely in html5 it has quite a

221
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:25,829
lot of users and also there's like a

222
00:12:25,829 --> 00:12:29,639
platform as a service for responsive web

223
00:12:29,639 --> 00:12:31,809
one of the company's called all

224
00:12:31,809 --> 00:12:33,879
mobilized in China I think there are

225
00:12:33,879 --> 00:12:36,279
some quite of similar companies in the

226
00:12:36,279 --> 00:12:39,339
US and in verse as well and basically

227
00:12:39,339 --> 00:12:41,949
currently there are like hundreds of

228
00:12:41,949 --> 00:12:44,860
millions of web pages has been converted

229
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:47,800
to responsive web pages by using this

230
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:48,570
tool and

231
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:55,800
many other stock web platforms and there

232
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:58,260
is this chat application called we chat

233
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:00,510
in China which is quite similar to

234
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:03,750
whatsapp in the US or lying in Japan but

235
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:07,020
if but the difference is that it also

236
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:09,060
has grown into an app store which

237
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:13,560
supposed html5 game development so there

238
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,300
are a lot of html5 game development

239
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:17,880
companies in China that uses this Web

240
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:22,380
Store to publish apps and some of them

241
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:24,960
are quite a experimental at this stage

242
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:27,080
but slowly they're gaining like

243
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:32,990
popularity so the conclusion is that

244
00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:36,180
despite the fact that I eight and six

245
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:38,250
are probably still the most popular

246
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:40,620
browsers in China but there's increased

247
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:44,610
support of html5 for for the the

248
00:13:44,610 --> 00:13:47,220
customers and the big tech companies are

249
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:50,190
really adapting really adopting html5

250
00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:53,010
technologies and startups are also

251
00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:55,260
started challenge the status core and

252
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:58,280
building really interesting applications

253
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:04,260
using age 15 technology and here are

254
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:06,210
just some like references I talked about

255
00:14:06,210 --> 00:14:08,730
like the open source frameworks I built

256
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:12,360
in the past and as well as the company I

257
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,850
talked about in China that used entire

258
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:18,270
web OS on the browser itself and also

259
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:22,890
the one Chinese startup that boost the

260
00:14:22,890 --> 00:14:24,930
app can which works a little bit like

261
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:28,140
PhoneGap but use a different approach

262
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:32,360
and basically that's my presentation

263
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:39,380
thank you everyone

264
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:45,460
mr. all right thank you so much she but

265
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:48,910

266
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:52,120
two does anyone have any questions hey

267
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:56,570
our speaker Simon here has a question I

00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:58,870
thanks great talk I've got two questions

269
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:01,750
actually all right one is you have a

270
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:05,830
really big base of windows XP in China

271
00:15:05,830 --> 00:15:07,630
right and you finding the users on those

272
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:09,460
machines are installing chrome or are

273
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:11,260
they just staying with whatever whatever

274
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:14,440
they got second question is that can

275
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,820
localize into English Rose are only

276
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:18,580
available in Chinese I'm sorry you'll be

277
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:21,640
like if I want to use f kin uh-huh is

278
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:23,080
the interface in Chinese or English or

279
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,910
the documentation oh yeah the

280
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:26,830
documentation is the product problem

281
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:29,500
yeah it's due in Chinese but you can ask

282
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:32,710
me probably okay yeah and and also the

283
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:34,390
chalice trip everybody can understand

284
00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:36,460
JavaScript so yeah that is you it's

285
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:37,960
gonna be yeah you have you can always

286
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:39,940
view the source code yeah and this a

287
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:42,010
little bit of casting you can know how

288
00:15:42,010 --> 00:15:44,470
it works yeah I that is the kind of like

289
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:46,180
a problem in China it's like most

290
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:47,860
developers don't share that much with

291
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:49,450
the rest of the world although they are

292
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:51,370
building some quite awesome applications

293
00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:54,850
and frameworks yeah and that's yeah I

294
00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:57,190
probably can try to talk to them if they

295
00:15:57,190 --> 00:15:59,500
can yeah have an English translation or

296
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,420
something yeah we're not providing

297
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:05,290
chinese translation yeah so what about

298
00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:07,720
the the windows XP nice and chrome

299
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:10,000
people installing modern browsers into

300
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,100
their computers or are they staying with

301
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:14,530
their they're all browsers so you have a

302
00:16:14,530 --> 00:16:16,150
lot of Windows XP users in China right

303
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:20,080
sorry me windows XP yeah a lot of

304
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,180
Windows XP in China people installing

305
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:24,490
modern browsers internet so then install

306
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:27,580
and crime on to XP right i mean with is

307
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:30,430
it's very complicated in china so there

308
00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:32,530
are a lot of local browsers as well like

309
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:35,410
like like built by the chinese companies

310
00:16:35,410 --> 00:16:38,260
tech companies but they actually use the

311
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:43,200
the chrome engine most of them yeah so

312
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:46,089
it's like it's very complicated and

313
00:16:46,089 --> 00:16:48,520
there are still a lot of IE in china and

314
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:50,850
it's not going

315
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:52,709
to disappear in the very short period of

316
00:16:52,709 --> 00:16:54,990
time during away 15 years yeah yeah it's

317
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:57,389
not going off and but the interesting

318
00:16:57,389 --> 00:16:59,220
thing is like in China there are a lot

319
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:03,660
of smartphone customers so so people

320
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:05,760
spending more time to us spending most

321
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:09,329
of time to browse on a smartphone or a

322
00:17:09,329 --> 00:17:12,360
tablet instead of on their desktop so

323
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:15,689
this created a huge opportunity for web

324
00:17:15,689 --> 00:17:17,160
developers to try to come up with

325
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:20,130
solutions to work around with smartphone

326
00:17:20,130 --> 00:17:22,620
devices so which is like a lot of

327
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:26,000
developers used currently develop html5

328
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,490
applications on the smartphone and like

329
00:17:29,490 --> 00:17:31,470
AB cane is one example and a lot of

330
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:34,110
users a lot of developers uses phonegap

331
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:39,419
as well and and also just and and also a

332
00:17:39,419 --> 00:17:41,220
lot of apps are just running in the

333
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:44,570
browser itself like use responsive web

334
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:48,179
approaches yeah great thanks a lot yeah

335
00:17:48,179 --> 00:17:50,789
